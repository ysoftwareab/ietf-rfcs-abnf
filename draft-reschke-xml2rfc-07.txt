Internet-Draft                   XML2RFC                      April 2014


1.  Introduction

   This document describes version 2 ('v2') of the 'XML2RFC' vocabulary;
   an XML-based language ('Extensible Markup Language', [XML]) used for
   writing RFCs ([RFCSTYLE]) and Internet-Drafts ([IDGUIDE]).

   It obsoletes the original version ("v1") [RFC2629], which contained
   the original language definition, and which was subsequently extended
   ("v2").  Furthermore, it discusses potential extensions in a future
   revision ("v3").

   Note that the vocabulary contains certain constructs that might not
   be used when generating the final text; however, they can provide
   useful data for other uses (such index generation, populating a
   keyword database, or syntax checks).

1.1.  Syntax Notation

   The XML vocabulary here is defined in prose, based on the Relax NG
   schema ([RNC]) contained in Appendix C (specified in Relax NG Compact
   Notation, "RNC").

   Note that the schema can be used for automated validity checks, but
   certain constraints are only described in prose (example: the
   conditionally required presence of the "abbrev" attribute).

2.  Elements

   The sections below describe all elements and their attributes.

   Note that attributes not labeled "mandatory" are optional.

2.1.  <abstract>

   Contains the abstract of the document.  The abstract ought to be
   self-contained and thus should not contain references or unexpanded
   abbreviations.  See Section 4.3 of [RFCSTYLE] for more information.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.19).

   Content model:

   One or more <t> elements (Section 2.38)

2.2.  <address>

   Provides address information for the author.

Internet-Draft                   XML2RFC                      April 2014


   This element appears as child element of: <author> (Section 2.6).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One optional <postal> element (Section 2.27)

   2.  One optional <phone> element (Section 2.26)

   3.  One optional <facsimile> element (Section 2.16)

   4.  One optional <email> element (Section 2.14)

   5.  One optional <uri> element (Section 2.42)

2.3.  <annotation>

   Provides additional prose augmenting a bibliographical reference.

   For instance:

   <annotation>
     Latest version available at <eref
     target='http://www.w3.org/TR/xml'/>.
   </annotation>

   ...will generate the text used in the reference for [XML].

   This element appears as child element of: <reference> (Section 2.30).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  Text

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.45)

   o  <eref> elements (Section 2.15)

   o  <iref> elements (Section 2.20)

   o  <cref> elements (Section 2.12)

   o  <spanx> elements (Section 2.36)

2.4.  <area>

   Provides information about the IETF area this document applies to
   (currently not used when generating documents).

   The value ought to be either the fullname or the abbreviation of one
   of the IETF areas as listed on <http://www.ietf.org/iesg/area.html>:
   "Applications", "app", "General", "gen", "Internet", "int",
   "Operations and Management", "ops", "Real-time Applications and
   Infrastructure", "rai", "Routing", "rtg", "Security", "sec",
   "Transport", "tsv".

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.19).

   Content model: only text content.

2.5.  <artwork>

   This element allows the inclusion of "artwork" into the document.

   <artwork> is the only element in the vocabulary that provides full
   control of horizontal whitespace and line breaks, and thus is used
   for a variety of things, such as:

   o  diagrams ("line art"),

   o  source code,

   o  formal languages (such as ABNF or the RNC notation used in this
      document),

   o  complex tables, or

   o  protocol unit diagrams.

   Alternatively, the "src" attribute allows referencing an external
   graphics file, such as a bitmap or a vector drawing.  In this case,
   the textual content acts as fallback for output formats that do not
   support graphics, and thus ought to contain either a "line art"
   variant of the graphics, or otherwise prose that describes the
   included image in sufficient detail.  Note that RFCs occasionally are
   published with enhanced diagrams; a recent example is [RFC5598].

   This element appears as child element of: <figure> (Section 2.17).

   Content model:

   Text

2.5.1.  'align' attribute

   Controls whether the artwork appears left (default), centered, or
   right.

   Allowed values:

   o  "left" (default)

   o  "center"

   o  "right"

2.5.2.  'alt' attribute

   Alternative text description of the artwork (not just the caption).

2.5.3.  'height' attribute

   The suggested height of the graphics included using the "src"
   attribute.

   This attribute is format-dependent and ought to be avoided.

   When generating HTML output, current implementations copy the
   attribute "as is".  For other output formats it is usually ignored.

2.5.4.  'name' attribute

   A filename suitable for the contents (such as for extraction to a
   local file).

   This attribute generally isn't used for document generation, but it
   can be helpful for other kinds of tools (such as automated syntax
   checkers which work by extracting the source code).

2.5.5.  'src' attribute

   The URI of a graphics file.

   Note that this can be a "data" URI ([RFC2397]) as well, in which case
   the graphics file essentially is in-lined.

2.5.6.  'type' attribute

   Specifies the type of the artwork.

   The value either is a well-known keyword (such as "abnf"), or an

   Internet Media Type (see [RFC2046]).

   How it is used depends on context and application.  For instance, a
   formatter can attempt to syntax-highlight code in certain known
   languages.

2.5.7.  'width' attribute

   The suggested width of the graphics included using the "src"
   attribute.

   This attribute is format-dependent and ought to be avoided.

   When generating HTML output, current implementations copy the
   attribute "as is".  For other output formats it is usually ignored.

2.5.8.  'xml:space' attribute

   Determines whitespace handling.

   "preserve" is both the default value and the only meaningful setting
   anyway (because that's what the <artwork> element is for).

   See also Section 2.10 of [XML].

   Allowed values:

   o  "default"

   o  "preserve" (default)

2.6.  <author>

   Provides information about a document author.

   The <author> elements contained within the document's <front> element
   are used to fill the boilerplate, and also to generate the "Author's
   Address" section (see Section 4.12 of [RFCSTYLE]).

   Note that an "author" can also be just an organization (by not
   specifying any of the name attributes, but adding the <organization>
   child element).

   Furthermore, the "role" attribute can be used to mark an author as
   "editor".  This is reflected both on the front page and in
   bibliographical references.  Note that this specification does not
   define a precise meaning for the term "editor".

   See Section "Authors vs. Contributors" of [RFCPOLICY] for more
   information.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.19).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One optional <organization> element (Section 2.25)

   2.  One optional <address> element (Section 2.2)

2.6.1.  'fullname' attribute

   The full name (used in the automatically generated "Author's Address"
   section).

2.6.2.  'initials' attribute

   Author initials (used on the front page and in references).

   Initials should be provided as a whitespace separated list of pairs
   of a letter and a dot.

2.6.3.  'role' attribute

   Specifies the role the author had in creating the document.

   Allowed values:

   o  "editor"

2.6.4.  'surname' attribute

   The author's surname.

2.7.  <back>

   Contains the "back" part of the document: the references and
   appendices.

   This element appears as child element of: <rfc> (Section 2.33).

   Content model:

   Document-wide unique identifier for this comment.  The processor will
   auto-generate an identifier when none is given.

   The value needs to be a valid XML "Name" (Section 2.3 of [XML]).

2.12.2.  'source' attribute

   Holds the "source" of a comment, such as the name or the initials of
   the person who made the comment.

2.13.  <date>

   Provides information about the publication date.

   Note that this element is used both for the boilerplate of the
   document being produced, and also inside bibliographic references.

   In the first case, it defines the publication date, which, when
   producing Internet-Drafts, will be used for computing the expiration
   date (see Section 8 of [IDGUIDE]).  When "year", "month" or "day" are
   left out, the processor will attempt to use the current system date
   if the attributes that are specified do match the system date.

   Note that month names need to match the full (English) month name
   ("January", "February", "March", "April", "May, "June", "July",
   "August", "September", "October", "November", or "December") in order
   for expiration calculations to work (some implementations might
   support additional formats, though).

   In the second case, the date information will be embedded as-is into
   the reference text.  Therefore, also vague dates ("ca. 2000"), date
   ranges, and so on, are allowed.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.19).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.13.1.  'day' attribute

   Day of publication.

2.13.2.  'month' attribute

   Month of publication.

2.13.3.  'year' attribute

   Year of publication.

2.14.  <email>

   Provides an email address.

   The value is expected to be the scheme-specific part of a "mailto"
   URI (so does not include the prefix "mailto:").  See Section 2 of
   [RFC6068] for details.

   This element appears as child element of: <address> (Section 2.2).

   Content model: only text content.

2.15.  <eref>

   Represents an "external" link (as specified in the "target"
   attribute).

   If the element has text content, that content will be used.
   Otherwise, the value of the target attribute will be inserted in
   angle brackets ([RFC3986], Appendix C).

   URI of the link target (see Section 3 of [RFC3986]).

2.16.  <facsimile>

   Represents the phone number of a fax machine.

   The value is expected to be the scheme-specific part of a "tel" URI
   (so does not include the prefix "tel:"), using the "global numbers"
   syntax.  See Section 3 of [RFC3966] for details.

   This element appears as child element of: <address> (Section 2.2).

   Content model: only text content.

2.17.  <figure>

   This element is used to represent a figure, consisting of an optional
   preamble, the actual figure, an optional postamble, and an optional
   title.

2.17.2.  'alt' attribute

   Duplicates functionality available on <artwork>; avoid it.

2.17.3.  'anchor' attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this figure.

   Furthermore, the presence of this attribute causes the figure to be
   numbered.

   The value needs to be a valid XML "Name" (Section 2.3 of [XML]).

2.17.4.  'height' attribute

   Duplicates functionality available on <artwork>; avoid it.

2.17.5.  'src' attribute

   Duplicates functionality available on <artwork>; avoid it.

2.17.6.  'suppress-title' attribute

   Figures that have an "anchor" attribute will automatically get an
   autogenerated title (such as "Figure 1"), even if the "title"
   attribute is absent.  Setting this attribute to "true" will prevent
   this.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true"

   o  "false" (default)

2.17.7.  'title' attribute

   The title for the figure; this usually appears on a line after the
   figure.

2.18.  <format>

   Provides a link to an additional format variant for a reference.

   Note that these additional links are neither used in published RFCs,
   nor supported by all tools.  If the goal is to provide a single URI
   for a reference, the "target" attribute on <reference> can be used
   instead.

   This element appears as child element of: <reference> (Section 2.30).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.18.1.  'octets' attribute

   Octet length of linked-to document.

2.18.2.  'target' attribute

   URI of document.

2.18.3.  'type' attribute (mandatory)

   The type of the linked-to document, such as "TXT", "HTML", or "PDF".

2.19.  <front>

   Represent the "front matter": metadata (such as author information),
   abstract, and additional notes.

   This element appears as child element of: <reference> (Section 2.30),
   and <rfc> (Section 2.33).

   7.  One optional <abstract> element (Section 2.1)

   8.  Optional <note> elements (Section 2.24)

2.20.  <iref>

   Provides terms for the document's index.

   Index entries can be either single items (when just the "item"
   attribute is given) or nested items (by specifying "subitem" as
   well).

   For instance:

   <iref item="Grammar" subitem="item"/>

   will produce an index entry for "Grammar, item".

   This element appears as child element of: <annotation> (Section 2.3),

2.20.1.  'item' attribute (mandatory)

   The item to include.

2.20.2.  'primary' attribute

   Setting this to "true" declares the occurrence as "primary", which
   might cause it to be highlighted in the index.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true"

   o  "false" (default)

2.20.3.  'subitem' attribute

   The subitem to include.

2.21.  <keyword>

   Specifies a keyword applicable to the document.

   Note that each element should only contain a single keyword; for
   multiple keywords, the element can simply be repeated.

   Keywords are used both in the RFC Index and in the metadata of
   generated document formats.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.19).

   Content model: only text content.

2.22.  <list>

   Delineates a text list.

   Each list item is represented by a <t> element.  The vocabulary
   currently does not directly support list items consisting of multiple
   paragraphs; if this is needed, <vspace> (Section 2.43) can be used as
   workaround.

   This element appears as child element of: <t> (Section 2.38).

   Content model:

   One or more <t> elements (Section 2.38)

2.22.1.  'counter' attribute

   This attribute holds a token that serves as an identifier for a
   counter.  The intended use is continuation of lists.

   Note that this attribute functions only when the style attribute is
   using the "format..." syntax (Section 2.22.3); otherwise, it is
   ignored.

2.22.2.  'hangIndent' attribute

   For list styles with potentially wide labels, this attribute can
   override the default indentation level, measured in characters.

   Note that it only affects style with variable-width labels
   ("format..." and "hanging", see below), and it may not affect formats
   in which the list item text appears _below_ the label.

2.22.3.  'style' attribute

   This attribute is used to control the display of a list.

   The value of this attribute is inherited by any nested lists that do
   not have this attribute set.  It may be set to:

   "empty" (or not set)

      For unlabeled list items; it can also be used for indentation
      purposes (this is the default value).

   "hanging"

      For lists where the items are labeled with a piece of text.

      The label text is specified in the 'hangText' attribute of the <t>
      element (Section 2.38.2).

   "letters"

      For ordered lists using letters as labels (lowercase letters
      followed by a period; after "z", it rolls over to a two-letter
      format).  For nested lists, processors usually flip between
      uppercase and lowercase.

   "numbers"

      For ordered lists using numbers as labels.

   "symbols"

      For unordered (bulleted) lists.

      The style of the bullets is chosen automatically be the processor
      (some implementations allow overriding the default using a
      processing instruction).

   And, finally:

   "format ..."

      For lists with customized labels, consisting of fixed text and an
      item counter in various formats.

      The value is a free-form text that allows counter values to be
      inserted using a "percent-letter" format.  For instance, "[REQ%d]"
      generates labels of the form "[REQ1]", where "%d" inserts the item

      number as decimal number.

      The following formats are supported:

      %c lowercase letters (a, b, c, etc.)

      %C uppercase letters (A, B, C, etc.)

      %d decimal numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.)

      %i lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc.)

      %I uppercase Roman numerals (I, II, III, etc.)

      %% represents a percent sign

      Other formats are reserved for future use.

   3.  Optional <format> elements (Section 2.18)

   4.  Optional <annotation> elements (Section 2.3)

2.30.1.  'anchor' attribute (mandatory)

   Document-wide unique identifier for this reference.  Usually, this
   will be used both to "label" the reference in the references section,
   and as an identifier in links to this reference entry.

   The value needs to be a valid XML "Name" (Section 2.3 of [XML]).

2.30.2.  'target' attribute

   Holds the URI for the reference.

   Note that depending on the <seriesInfo> element, a URI might not be
   needed, nor desirable, as it can be automatically generated (for
   instance, for RFCs).

2.31.  <references>

   Contains a set of bibliographical references.

   In the early days of the RFC series, there was only one "References"
   section per RFC.  This convention was later changed to group
   references into two sets, "Normative" and "Informative"; see Section

   Content model: only text content.

2.33.  <rfc>

   This is the root element of the xml2rfc vocabulary.

   Processors distinguish between RFC mode ("number" attribute being
   present) and Internet-Draft mode ("docName" attribute being present):
   it is invalid to specify both.  Setting neither "number" nor

2.33.3.  'docName' attribute

   For Internet-Drafts, this specifies the draft name (which appears
   below the title).

   Note that the file extension is not part of the draft, so in general
   it should end with the current draft number ("-", plus two digits).

   Furthermore, it is good practice to disambiguate current editor
   copies from submitted drafts (for instance, by replacing the draft
   number with the string "latest").

2.33.5.  'iprExtract' attribute

   Identifies a single section within the document (by its 'anchor'
   attribute) for which extraction "as-is" is explicitly allowed (this
   is only relevant for historic values of the "ipr" attribute).

2.33.6.  'number' attribute

   The value needs to be a valid XML "Name" (Section 2.3 of [XML]).

2.34.2.  'title' attribute (mandatory)

   The title of the section.

2.34.3.  'toc' attribute

   Determines whether the section is included in the Table Of Contents.

   The processor usually has defaults for whether a Table Of Contents
   will be produced at all, and sections of which maximal depth will be
   included (frequently: 3). "include" and "exclude" allow overriding
   the processor's default behavior for the element they are specified
   on (they do not affect nested elements).

   Allowed values:

   o  "include"

   o  "exclude"

   o  "default" (default)

2.35.  <seriesInfo>

   Specifies the document series in which this document appears, and
   also specifies an identifier within that series.

   This element appears as child element of: <reference> (Section 2.30).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.35.1.  'name' attribute (mandatory)

   The name of the series.

   The following names trigger specific processing (such as for auto-
   generating links, and adding descriptions such as "work in
   progress"): "BCP", "FYI", "Internet-Draft", "RFC", and "STD".

2.35.2.  'value' attribute (mandatory)

   The identifier within the series specified by the "name" attribute.

   For BCPs, FYIs, RFCs, and STDs this is the number within the series.
   For Internet-Drafts, it is the full draft name (ending with the two-
   digit version number).

2.36.  <spanx>

   Wraps a piece of text, indicating special formatting styles.

   When generating plain text, processors usually emulate font changes
   using characters such as "*" and "_".

   The following styles are defined:

   emph  Simple emphasis (this is the default).

   strong  Strong emphasis.

   verb  "Verbatim" text (usually displayed usign a monospaced font
      face).

   This element appears as child element of: <annotation> (Section 2.3),
   <c> (Section 2.8), <postamble> (Section 2.28), <preamble>
   (Section 2.29), and <t> (Section 2.38).

   Content model: only text content.

2.36.1.  'style' attribute

   The style to be used (defaults to "emph").

2.36.2.  'xml:space' attribute

   Determines whitespace handling.

   According to the DTD, the default value is "preserve".  Tests however
   show that it doesn't have any effect on processing; thus this

   See also Section 2.10 of [XML].

   Allowed values:

   o  "default"

   o  "preserve" (default)

2.37.  <street>

   Provides a street address.

   This element appears as child element of: <postal> (Section 2.27).

2.38.1.  'anchor' attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this paragraph.

   The value needs to be a valid XML "Name" (Section 2.3 of [XML]).

2.38.2.  'hangText' attribute

   Holds the label ("hanging text") for items in lists using the
   "hanging" style (see Section 2.22.3).

2.39.  <texttable>

   Contains a table, consisting of an optional preamble, a header line,
   rows, an optional postamble, and an optional title.

   The number of columns in the table is determined by the number of
   <ttcol> elements.  The number of rows in the table is determined by
   the number of <c> elements divided by the number of columns.  There
   is no requirement that the number of <c> elements be evenly divisible
   by the number of columns.

   This element appears as child element of: <section> (Section 2.34).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One optional <preamble> element (Section 2.29)

   2.  One or more <ttcol> elements (Section 2.41)

2.39.2.  'anchor' attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this table.

   Furthermore, the presence of this attribute causes the table to be
   numbered.

   The value needs to be a valid XML "Name" (Section 2.3 of [XML]).

2.39.3.  'style' attribute

   Selects which borders should be drawn, where

   o  "all" means borders around all table cells,

   o  "full" is like "all" except no horizontal lines between table rows
      (except below the column titles),

   o  "headers" adds just a separator between column titles and rows,
      and

   o  "none" means no borders at all.

   Allowed values:

   o  "all"

   o  "none"

   o  "headers"

   o  "full" (default)

2.39.4.  'suppress-title' attribute

   Tables that have an "anchor" attribute will automatically get an
   autogenerated title (such as "Table 1"), even if the "title"
   attribute is absent.  Setting this attribute to "true" will prevent
   this.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true"

   o  "false" (default)

2.39.5.  'title' attribute

   The title for the table; this usually appears on a line below the
   table body.

2.40.  <title>

   Represents the document title.

   When this element appears in the <front> element of the current
   document, the title might also appear in page headers or footers.  If
   it's long (~40 characters), the "abbrev" attribute is used to
   specified an abbreviated variant.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.19).

   Content model: only text content.

2.40.1.  'abbrev' attribute

   Specifies an abbreviated variant of the document title.

2.41.  <ttcol>

   Contains a column heading in a table.

   This element appears as child element of: <texttable> (Section 2.39).

   Content model: only text content.

2.41.1.  'align' attribute

   Determines the horizontal alignment within the table column.

   Allowed values:

   o  "left" (default)

2.42.  <uri>

   Contains a web address associated with the author.

   The contents should be a valid URI (see Section 3 of [RFC3986]).

   This element appears as child element of: <address> (Section 2.2).

   Content model: only text content.

2.43.  <vspace>

   This element can be used to force the inclusion of a single line
   break or multiple blank lines.

   Note that this is a purely presentational element and thus its use
   ought to be avoided.

   This element appears as child element of: <t> (Section 2.38).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.43.1.  'blankLines' attribute

   Number of blank lines to be inserted, where "0" indicates a single
   line break (defaults to "0").

   For paged output formats, no additional blank lines should be
   generated after a page break.

2.44.  <workgroup>

   This element is used to specify the Working Group the document
   originates from, if any.  The recommended format is the official name
   of the Working Group (with some capitalization).

   In Internet-Drafts, this is used in the upper left corner of the
   boilerplate, replacing the "Network Working Group" string.
   Formatting software can append the words "Working Group" or "Research
   Group", depending on the "submissionType" property on the <rfc>
   element (Section 2.33.9).

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.19).

   Content model: only text content.

2.45.  <xref>

   Inserts a reference to a different part of a document.

   The generated text depends on whether the <xref> is empty (in which
   case the processor will try to generate a meaningful text fragment),
   and the nature of the referenced document part.

   Any element that allows the "anchor" attribute can be referenced,
   however there are restrictions with respect to the text content being
   generated.  For instance, a <t> can be a reference target, however,
   because paragraphs are not (visibly) numbered, the author will have
   to make sure that the prose is sufficient for a reader to understand
   what is being referred to.

   [[anchor2: This needs to be expanded with examples and with a
   discussion how the autogenerated text differs when <xref> is not
   empty]]

   This element appears as child element of: <annotation> (Section 2.3),
   <c> (Section 2.8), <postamble> (Section 2.28), <preamble>
   (Section 2.29), and <t> (Section 2.38).

   Content model: only text content.

2.45.1.  'format' attribute

   This attribute is used to control the format of the generated
   reference text.

   "counter"

      Inserts a counter, such as the number of a section, figure, or
      table.

   "default"

      Inserts a text fragment that describes the referenced part
      completely, such as "Section 2", "Table 4", or "[XML]".

   "none"

      There will be no auto-generated text.

   "title"

      Inserts a title for the referenced element (usually obtained from
      the referenced element's "title" attribute; some processors also

      use the <title> child element or a <reference> target).

   Allowed values:

   o  "counter"

   o  "title"

   o  "none"

   o  "default" (default)

2.45.2.  'pageno' attribute

   Unused.

   It's unclear what the purpose of this attribute is; processors seem
   to ignore it and it never was documented.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true"

   o  "false" (default)

2.45.3.  'target' attribute (mandatory)

   Identifies the document component being referenced.

   The value needs to match the value of the "anchor" attribute of
   another element in the document.

3.  Special Unicode Code Points

   Although the current RFC format does not allow non-ASCII Unicode
   characters ([UNICODE]), some of them can be used to enforce certain
   behaviors of formatters.

   For instance:

   non-breaking space (U+00A0)

      Represents a space character where no line break should happen.
      This is frequenly used in titles (by excluding certain space
      characters from the line breaking algorithm, the processor will
      use the remaining whitespace ocurrences for line breaks).

   non-breaking hyphen (U+2011)



Reschke                 Expires October 10, 2014               [Page 35]

Internet-Draft                   XML2RFC                      April 2014


      Similarly, this represents a hyphen character where nevertheless
      no line breaking ought to occur.

   word joiner (U+2060)

      Also called "zero width non-breaking space" -- can be used to
      disallow line breaking between two non-whitespace characters.

   Note that in order to use these characters by name, they need to be
   declared either in the Document Type Definition (DTD, [XML], Section
   2.9), or in the "internal subset" ([XML], Section 2.8), like that:

   <?xml version="1.0"?>

   <!DOCTYPE rfc [

     <!-- declare nbsp and friends -->
     <!ENTITY nbsp    "&#xa0;">
     <!ENTITY nbhy    "&#x2011;">
     <!ENTITY wj      "&#x2060;">
   ]>

4.  Including Files

   This version of the vocabulary does not support an inclusion
   mechanism on it's own -- thus, a document always needs to be self-
   contained.

   That being said, some processors do support file inclusion using
   processing instructions (Section 2.6 of [XML]).

   Furthermore, XML itself allows inclusion of external content using
   the "internal subset" (Section 2.8 of [XML]).  Unfortunately, this
   requires declaring the external data in the DTD upfront.

   For instance:

   <?xml version="1.0"?>

   <!DOCTYPE rfc [

     <!-- allow later RFC2616 reference using "&rfc2616;" -->
     <!-- the data will be fetched from xml.resource.org -->
     <!ENTITY rfc2616 PUBLIC
     "http://xml.resource.org/public/rfc/bibxml/reference.RFC.2616.xml">
   ]>

   ...declares the entity "rfc2616", which then can be used in the

Internet-Draft                   XML2RFC                      April 2014


   "references" section:

     <references>
       &rfc2616;
     </references>

   Note that this mechanism only works for well-formed XML fragments;
   thus any plain text that would need to be escaped in XML can't be
   included as-is.

5.  Internationalization Considerations

   This format is based on [XML], thus does not have any issues
   representing arbitrary Unicode [UNICODE] characters in text content.

   However, the current canonical RFC format is restricted to US-ASCII
   [USASCII] characters ([RFC2223], Section 3).  Future versions are
   likely to relax this role, and it is expected that the vocabulary
   will be extended so that US-ACSII alternatives can be provided when
   that makes sense (for instance, in contact information).

6.  Security Considerations

   The "name" attribute on the <artwork> element (Section 2.5.4) can be
   used to derive a filename for saving to a local file system.
   Trusting this kind of information without pre-processing is a known
   security risk; see Section 4.3 of [RFC6266] for more information.

   Furthermore, all security considerations related to XML processing
   are relevant as well (see Section 7 of [RFC3470]).

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Internet Media Type Registration

   IANA maintains the registry of Internet media types [BCP13] at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types>.

   This document serves as the specification for the Internet media type
   "application/rfc+xml".  The following is to be registered with IANA.

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  rfc+xml

   Required parameters:  There are no required parameters.

   Optional parameters:  "charset": This parameter has identical
      semantics as the charset parameter of the "application/xml" media
      type specified in [RFC3023].

   Encoding considerations:  Identical to those of "application/xml" as
      described in Section 3.2 of [RFC3023].

   Security considerations:  As defined in Section 6.  In addition, as
      this media type uses the "+xml" convention, it inherits the
      security considerations described in Section 10 of [RFC3023].

   Interoperability considerations:  N/A

   Published specification:  This specification.

   Applications that use this media type:  Applications that either
      transform xml2rfc to output formats such as plain text or HTML,
      plus additional analysis tools.

   Fragment identifier considerations:  The "anchor" attribute is used
      for assigning document-wide unique identifiers that can be uses as
      shorthand pointers, as described in Section 2.8 of [XPOINTER].

   Additional information:

      Deprecated alias names for this type:  None.

      Magic number(s):  As specified for "application/xml" in Section
         3.2 of [RFC3023].

      File extension(s):  .xml

      Macintosh file type code(s):  TEXT

Appendix A.  Front Page Generation

A.1.  The /rfc/@category Attribute

   For RFCs, the "category" determines the "maturity level" (see Section
   4 of [RFC2026]).  The allowed values are "std" for "Standards Track",
   "bcp" for "BCP", "info" for "Informational", "exp" for
   "Experimental", and "historic" for - surprise - "Historic".

   For Internet-Drafts, the category attribute is not needed, but will
   appear on the front page as "Intended Status".  Supplying this
   information can be useful to reviewers.

A.2.  The /rfc/@ipr Attribute

   This attribute value can take a long list of values, each of which
   describes an IPR policy for the document.  This attribute's values

Internet-Draft                   XML2RFC                      April 2014


   are not the result of a grand plan, but remain simply for historic
   reasons.  Of these values, only a few are currently in use; all
   others are supported by the various tools for backwards compatibility
   with old source files.

      Note: some variations of the boilerplate are selected based on the
      document's date; therefore it is important to specify the "year",
      "month" and "day" attributes of the "<date>" element when
      archiving the XML source of an Internet-Draft on the day of
      submission.

   _Disclaimer: THIS ONLY PROVIDES IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION.  IF YOU
   NEED LEGAL ADVICE, PLEASE CONTACT A LAWYER._ For further information,
   refer to <http://trustee.ietf.org/docs/IETF-Copyright-FAQ.pdf>.

   For the current "Status Of This Memo" text, the "submissionType"
   attribute determines whether a statement about "Code Components" is
   inserted (which is the case for the value "IETF", which is the
   default).  Other values, such as "independent", suppress this part of
   the text.

A.2.1.  Current Values: '*trust200902'

   The name for these values refers to the "IETF TRUST Legal Provisions
   Relating to IETF Documents", sometimes simply called the "TLP, that
   went into effect on February 15, 2009 ([TLP2.0]).  Updates to this
   document were published on September 12, 2009 ([TLP3.0]) and on
   December 28, 2009 ([TLP4.0]), modifying the license for code
   components (see <http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/> for further
   information).  The actual text is located in Section 6 ("Text To Be
   Included in IETF Documents") of these documents.

   The tools will automatically produce the "correct" text depending on
   the document's date information (see above):

   +----------+--------------------------------+
   | TLP      | starting with publication date |
   +----------+--------------------------------+
   | [TLP3.0] | 2009-11-01                     |
   | [TLP4.0] | 2010-04-01                     |
   +----------+--------------------------------+

A.2.1.1.  trust200902

   This should be the default, unless one of the more specific
   '*trust200902' values is a better fit.  It produces the text in
   Sections 6.a and 6.b of the TLP.

A.2.1.2.  noModificationTrust200902

   This produces additional text from Section 6.c.i of the TLP:

      This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may
      not be created, except to format it for publication as an RFC or
      to translate it into languages other than English.

      Note: this clause is incompatible with RFCs that are published on
      the Standards Track.

A.2.1.3.  noDerivativesTrust200902

   This produces the additional text from Section 6.c.ii of the TLP:

      This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may
      not be created, and it may not be published except as an Internet-
      Draft.

      Note: this clause is incompatible with RFCs.

A.2.1.4.  pre5378Trust200902

   This produces the additional text from Section 6.c.iii of the TLP,
   frequently called the "pre-5378 escape clause":

      This document may contain material from IETF Documents or IETF
      Contributions published or made publicly available before November
      10, 2008.  The person(s) controlling the copyright in some of this
      material may not have granted the IETF Trust the right to allow
      modifications of such material outside the IETF Standards Process.
      Without obtaining an adequate license from the person(s)
      controlling the copyright in such materials, this document may not
      be modified outside the IETF Standards Process, and derivative
      works of it may not be created outside the IETF Standards Process,
      except to format it for publication as an RFC or to translate it
      into languages other than English.

   See Section 4 of
   <http://trustee.ietf.org/docs/IETF-Copyright-FAQ.pdf> for further
   information about when to use this value.

      Note: this text appears under "Copyright Notice", unless the
      document was published before November 2009, in which case it
      appears under "Status Of This Memo".

A.2.2.  Historic Values

A.2.2.1.  Historic Values: '*trust200811'

   The attribute values "trust200811", "noModificationTrust200811" and
   "noDerivativesTrust200811" are similar to their "trust200902"
   counterparts, except that they use text specified in <http://
   trustee.ietf.org/license-info/archive/
   IETF-Trust-License-Policy_11-10-08.pdf>.

A.2.2.2.  Historic Values: '*3978'

   The attribute values "full3978", "noModification3978" and
   "noDerivatives3978" are similar to their counterparts above, except
   that they use text specified in RFC 3978 (March 2005).

A.2.2.3.  Historic Values: '*3667'

   The attribute values "full3667", "noModification3667" and
   "noDerivatives3667" are similar to their counterparts above, except
   that they use text specified in RFC 3667 (February 2004).

A.2.2.4.  Historic Values: '*2026'

   The attribute values "full2026" and "noDerivativeWorks2026" are
   similar to their counterparts above, except that they use text
   specified in RFC 2026 (October 1996).

   The special value "none" was also used back then, and denied the IETF
   any rights beyond publication as Internet-Draft.

Appendix B.  Changes from RFC 2629 ('v1')

   [[v1diff: See <http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/
   draft-reschke-xml2rfc-02.html#rfc.section.E> for a comparison of the
   schemata.]]

B.1.  Removed Elements

   The <appendix> element has been removed; to generate an appendix,
   place a <section> inside <back>.

B.2.  Changed Defaults

   Many attributes have lost their "default" value; this is to avoid
   having document semantics differ based on whether a DTD was specified
   and evaluated.  Processors will handle absent values the way the
   default value was specified before.

B.3.  Changed Elements

   <artwork>: Has a set of new attributes: "name", "type", "src",
   "align", "alt", "width", and "height".  (Section 2.5)

   <author>: The <organization> element is now optional.  The "role"
   attribute was added.  (Section 2.6)

   <country>: The requirement to use ISO 3166 codes was removed.
   (Section 2.11)

   <date>: All attributes are now optional.  (Section 2.13)

   <figure>: Has a set of new attributes: "suppress-title", "src",
   "align", "alt", "width", and "height".  (Section 2.17)

   <iref>: Has a new "primary" attribute.  (Section 2.20)

   <list>: The "style" attribute isn't restricted to a set of enumerated
   values anymore.  The "hangIndent" and "counter" attributes have been
   added.  (Section 2.22)

   <rfc>: The "ipr" attribute has gained additional values.  The
   attributes "consensus", "iprExtract", "submissionType", and "xml:
   lang" have been added.  (Section 2.33)

   <reference>: <annotation> allows adding prose to a reference.  The
   "anchor" attribute has been made mandatory.  (Section 2.30)

   <references>: Can now appear multiple times, and carry a "title"
   attribute (so that normative and informative references can be
   split).  (Section 2.31)

   <section>: The new "toc" attribute controls whether it will appear in
   the Table Of Contents. <iref> can now appear as direct child element.
   (Section 2.34)

   <t>: The "anchor" attribute can now be used as well, however there
   are restrictions on how they can be referred to.  (Section 2.38)

B.4.  New Elements

   The following elements have been added: <annotation> (Section 2.3),
   <c> (Section 2.8), <cref> (Section 2.12), <format> (Section 2.18),
   <spanx> (Section 2.36), <texttable> (Section 2.39).

   p://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/tools/xml2rfc/vocabulary/v2/03/
   xml2rfcv2.dtd>).

Appendix D.  Proposed Future Changes for 'v3'

   Discussion of "v3" changes takes place on the rfc-interest mailing
   list (rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org), which has its home page at
   <http://www.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-interest>.  See also
   <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rse/wiki/doku.php?id=design:xml-tags> for
   a related Wiki page.

D.1.  Contact Information

   If contact information is changed to allow non-ASCII characters: add
   a place for a ASCII fallback (probably just for the author names).

   The content model for <postal> ought to be more strict to allow at
   most one of <city>, <region>, <code>, and <country>.

   It should be possible to have multiple <email> and <uri> elements
   (see also <http://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/xml2rfc/trac/ticket/36>).

   <facsimile> looks outdated, while a container for IM (messaging) URIs
   is missing.  Maybe this area needs to be aligned with vCard.

   Section 4.11 of [RFCSTYLE] hints at a "Contributors" Section that
   could supply contact information similar to the one in the auto-
   generated "Authors' Address" Section.  Consider how to capture
   contributor contact information (probably not using <author> to avoid
   confusion).  Furthermore, consider ways to augment the contact
   information section with prose.

D.2.  Figures

   Cleanup the set of overlapping attributes between <figure> and
   <artwork>.

   For artwork that consists of a sequence of items (such as messages in
   a protocol example), it would be good if a <figure> element could
   contain multiple <artwork> elements (to assist code to find good
   places for page breaks).

   Extend <figure> to support different types of artwork (such as by
   specifying certain type attribute values, see <http://greenbytes.de/
   tech/webdav/rfc2629xslt/rfc2629xslt.html#artwork.types>), and also
   avoid having to markup code (such as ABNF) as "artwork".

   It would be good if "code components" could be marked as such.

   Finally, even in preformatted text use of markup could be useful to
   support (a) references, or (b) highlighting the important bits (<http
   ://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2629xslt/
   rfc2629xslt.html#ext-rfc2629.artwork>).

D.3.  Linking

   Extend <xref> so that subsection/anchors can be specified (see <http:
   //greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2629xslt/
   rfc2629xslt.html#ext-rfc2629.xref>).

   Remove the "pageno" attribute which seems to be both undocumented and
   non-functional.

D.4.  Lists

   Allow multiple paragraphs in list items; eliminating the need to use
   <vspace> -- this could be achieved by adding a list item container
   element ("<lt>", see <http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2629xslt/
   rfc2629xslt.html#ext.element.lt> and
   <http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/xml2rfc/current/
   msg02010.html>).

   Add support for a "dictionary" style; eliminating the need to combine
   "hanging" with <vspace> to force new lines (see thread around <http:/
   /www.rfc-editor.org/pipermail/rfc-interest/2013-December/
   005876.html>).

Internet-Draft                   XML2RFC                      April 2014


D.5.  References

   Allow overriding the "anchor" attribute of an included <reference>
   element.

   Add a way to add prose to a reference that avoids abuse of
   <seriesInfo>.

   Allow <reference>s that identify a document set such as a BCP.

   Deprecate or remove the <format> element; right now it's not used for
   the generation of the plain text document anyway.

   The "anchor" attribute is optional because it is not needed when
   using numeric references (symrefs processing instruction), and the
   reference actually is not in use.  This is an edge case that doesn't
   need special support in the vocabulary and thus should be removed.

D.6.  Archival Considerations

   When this vocabulary becomes the canonical RFC format, it will need
   to be able to capture all generated information, such as section/
   figure/table numbers, plus any auto-generated boilerplate (copyright
   statements etc.).

D.7.  Document Metadata

   Extend the concept of language tagging to at least examples and
   contact information to address potential japanese/chinese font
   confusion.

   Provide a way to indicate the intended level on the standards track.

   Include feedback information in a way so that generated documents can
   provide usable feedback links (see <http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/
   rfc2629xslt/rfc2629xslt.html#ext.element.feedback>).

D.8.  Including Material

   As discussed in Section 4, file inclusion currently uses out-of-the-
   box XML mechanisms or processor-specific directives.

   We need to decide whether the vocabulary should have its own
   inclusion mechanism, or whether it would be better to use a generic
   solution such as [XINCLUDE] instead.

D.9.  Misc.

   Make the <date> element optional; all of its content is optional
   already.

   <spanx> has both a weird whitespace model ("preserve") and
   problematic styling.  Consider to deprecate it in favor of elements
   such as <b>, <i>, and <tt>.

   Indented paragraphs currently can be created by abusing the <list>.
   It would be good to have a special element for this purpose.

   Provide a special element for inserting block quotes (<http://
   greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2629xslt/
   rfc2629xslt.html#ext.element.blockquote>).

   The content model for <cref> should be extended to allow more flow
   elements, such as <xref> and <eref>.

   Section titles should really be elements, not attributes (this would
   allow them to contain markup).

   Text tables are currently very constrained.  For instance, it would
   be good if alignment of headers and table cells could be de-coupled
   (<http://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/xml2rfc/trac/ticket/69>).

   Counters are currently restricted to lists, figures, and tables.
   Maybe there should be a generic mechanism that is not directly tied
   to other elements
   (<http://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/xml2rfc/trac/ticket/68>).
