         Hierarchical Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE).
                  draft-dhodylee-pce-stateful-hpce-00

Abstract

   A Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information on 
   the current network state, including: computed Label Switched Path
   (LSPs), reserved resources within the network, and pending path
   computation requests. This information may then be considered when 
   computing new traffic engineered LSPs, and for associated
   and dependent LSPs, received from Path Computation Clients (PCCs).  
   
   The Hierarchical Path Computation Element (H-PCE) architecture, 
   provides an architecture to allow the optimum sequence of 
   inter-connected domains to be selected, and network policy to be 
   applied if applicable, via the use of a hierarchical relationship
   between PCEs.
   
   Combining the capabilities of Stateful PCE and the Hierarchical PCE 
   would be advantageous. This document describes general 
   considerations and use cases for the deployment of Stateful PCE(s)
   using the Hierarchical PCE architecture.

Internet-Draft                STATEFUL-HPCE                February 2016


1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients' (PCCs)
   requests.

   A stateful PCE is capable of considering, for the purposes of
   path computation, not only the network state in terms of links and 
   nodes (referred to as the Traffic Engineering Database or TED) but
   also the status of active services (previously computed paths, 
   and currently reserved resources, stored in the Label Switched 
   Paths Database (LSPDB).


   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-app] describes general considerations for
   a stateful PCE deployment and examines its applicability and
   benefits, as well as its challenges and limitations through a number
   of use cases.  
   
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to
   provide stateful control.  A stateful PCE has access to not only the
   information carried by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP),
   but also the set of active paths and their reserved resources for its
   computations.  The additional state allows the PCE to compute 
   constrained paths while considering individual LSPs and their 
   interactions.  [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] describes the setup,
   maintenance and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE
   model.
   
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] also describes the active stateful PCE. 
   The active PCE functionality allows a PCE to reroute an existing 
   LSP or make changes to the attributes of an existing LSP, or delegate 
   control of specific LSPs to a new PCE. 
   
   The ability to compute shortest constrained TE LSPs in Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across
   multiple domains has been identified as a key motivation for PCE
   development.  [RFC6805] describes a Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE)
   architecture which can be used for computing end-to-end paths for
   inter-domain MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) and GMPLS Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs).  Within the Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) architecture 
   [RFC6805], the Parent PCE (P-PCE) is used to compute a multi-domain
   path based on the domain connectivity information.  A Child PCE 
   (C-PCE) may be responsible for a single domain or multiple domains, 
   it is used to compute the intra-domain path based on its domain 
   topology information.

   This document presents general considerations for stateful PCE(s) in
   hierarchical PCE architecture.  In particular, the behavior changes
   and additions to the existing stateful PCE mechanisms (including PCE-
   initiated LSP setup and active PCE usage) in the context of 
   networks using the H-PCE architecture.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The terminology is as per [RFC4655], [RFC5440], [RFC6805], and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].

3.  Hierarchical Stateful PCE

   As described in [RFC6805], in the hierarchical PCE architecture, a
   P-PCE maintains a domain topology map that contains the child
   domains (seen as vertices in the topology) and their interconnections
   (links in the topology).  The P-PCE has no information about the
   content of the child domains.  Each child domain has at least one PCE
   capable of computing paths across the domain.  These PCEs are known
   as C-PCEs and have a direct relationship with the P-PCE.  The P-PCE 
   builds the domain topology map either via direct configuration 
   (allowing network policy to also be applied) or from learned 
   information received from each C-PCE. 

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] specifies new functions to support a
   stateful PCE.  It also specifies that a function can be initiated
   either from a PCC towards a PCE (C-E) or from a PCE towards a PCC
   (E-C).

   This document extends these functions to support H-PCE Architecture
   from a C-PCE towards a P-PCE (CE-PE) or from a P-PCE
   towards a C-PCE (PE-CE).  All PCE types herein (i.e., PE or CE)
   are assumed to be 'stateful PCE'.
   
   A number of interactions are expected in the Hierarchical Stateful
   PCE architecture, these include:  

   LSP State Report (CE-PE):  a child stateful PCE sends an LSP state
      report to a Parent Stateful PCE whenever the state of a LSP
      changes.

   LSP State Synchronization (CE-PE):  after the session between the
      Child and Parent stateful PCEs is initialized, the P-PCE must
      learn the state of C-PCE's TE LSPs.

   LSP Control Delegation (CE-PE,PE-CE):  a C-PCE grants to the
      P-PCE the right to update LSP attributes on one or more LSPs;
      the C-PCE may withdraw the delegation or the P-PCE may
      give up the delegation at any time.

   LSP Update Request (PE-CE):  a stateful P-PCE requests
      modification of attributes on a C-PCE's TE LSP.

   PCE LSP Initiation Request (PE-CE):  a stateful P-PCE requests
      C-PCE to initiate a TE LSP.

3.1.  Passive Operations

   Procedures as described in [RFC6805] are applied, where the ingress
   C-PCE sends a request to the P-PCE.  The P-PCE selects
   a set of candidate domain paths based on the domain topology and the
   state of the inter-domain links.  It then sends computation requests
   to the C-PCEs responsible for each of the domains on the

Internet-Draft                STATEFUL-HPCE                February 2016


   candidate domain paths.  Each C-PCE computes a set of candidate
   path segments across its domain and sends the results to the P-PCE.
   The P-PCE uses this information to select path segments
   and concatenate them to derive the optimal end-to-end inter-domain
   path.  The end-to-end path is then sent to the C-PCE that
   received the initial path request, and this C-PCE passes the path
   on to the PCC that issued the original request.

   As per [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce], PCC sends an LSP State Report
   carried on a PCRpt message to the C-PCE, indicating the LSP's
   status.  The C-PCE MAY further propagate the State Report to the
   P-PCE.  A local policy at C-PCE MAY dictate which LSPs to be
   reported to the P-PCE.  The PCRpt message is sent from C-PCE
   to P-PCE.

   State synchronization mechanism as described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-sync-optimizations] are applicable to PCEP
   session between C-PCE and P-PCE as well.

   Taking the sample hierarchical domain topology example from [RFC6805]
   as the reference topology for the entirety of this document.

   Steps 1 to 11 are exactly as described in section 4.6.2 (Hierarchical
   PCE End-to-End Path Computation Procedure) of [RFC6805], the 
   following additional steps are added for stateful PCE:

   (1)  The Ingress LSR initiates the setup of the LSP as per the path
        and reports to the PCE1 the LSP status ("GOING-UP").

   (2)  The PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

Internet-Draft                STATEFUL-HPCE                February 2016


   (3)  The Ingress LSR notifies the LSP state to PCE1 when the state is
        "UP".

   (4)  The PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

3.2.  Active Operations


   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] describes the case of active stateful
   PCE. The active PCE functionality uses two specific PCEP messages:
   
   o Update Request (PCUpd)
   o State Report (PCRpt)
   
   The first is sent by the PCE to a Path Computation Client (PCC) for 
   modifying LSP attributes. The PCC sends back a PCRpt to acknowledge
   the requested operation. PCRpt has the same structure of PCNtf 
   message.   

   As per [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce], Delegation is an operation to
   grant a PCE, temporary rights to modify a subset of LSP parameters on
   one or more PCC's LSPs.  The C-PCE may further choose to delegate
   to P-PCE based on a local policy.  The PCRpt message with "D"
   (delegate) flag is sent from C-PCE to P-PCE.

   To update an LSP, a PCE send to the PCC, an LSP Update Request using
   a PCUpd message.  For LSP delegated to the P-PCE via the child
   PCE, the P-PCE can use the same PCUpd message to request change
   to the C-PCE (the Ingress domain PCE), the PCE further propagates
   the update request to the PCC.

   The P-PCE uses the same mechanism described in Section 3.1 to
   compute the end to end path using PCReq and PCRep messages.

   The following additional steps are also initially performed, 
   for active operations, again using the reference architecture
   described in Figure 1 (Sample Hierarchical Domain Topology).

   (1)  The Ingress LSR delegates the LSP to the PCE1 via PCRpt message
        with D flag set.

   (2)  The PCE1 further delegates the LSP to the P-PCE (PCE5).

   Steps 4 to 10 of section 4.6.2 of [RFC6805] are executed to determine
   the end to end path.

   (3)  The P-PCE (PCE5) sends the update request to the C-PCE
        (PCE1) via PCUpd message.

   (4)  The PCE1 further updates the LSP to the Ingress LSR (PCC).

   (5)  The Ingress LSR initiates the setup of the LSP as per the path
        and reports to the PCE1 the LSP status ("GOING-UP").

   (6)  The PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

   (7)  The Ingress LSR notifies the LSP state to PCE1 when the state is
        "UP".

   (8)  The PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

3.3.  PCE Initiation Operation

   [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] describes the setup, maintenance and
   teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model, without
   the need for local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a
   dynamic network that is centrally controlled and deployed.  To
   instantiate or delete an LSP, the PCE sends the Path Computation LSP
   Initiate Request (PCInitiate) message to the PCC.  In case of inter-
   domain LSP in Hierarchical PCE architecture, the initiation
   operations can be carried out at the P-PCE.  In which case after
   P-PCE finishes the E2E path computation, it can send the
   PCInitiate message to the C-PCE (the Ingress domain PCE), the PCE
   further propagates the initiate request to the PCC.

   The following additional steps are also initially performed, 
   for PCE initiated operations, again using the reference 
   architecture described in Figure 1 (Sample Hierarchical Domain
   Topology):

   (1)  The P-PCE (PCE5) is requested to initiate a LSP.

   Steps 4 to 10 of section 4.6.2 of [RFC6805] are executed to determine
   the end to end path.

   (2)  The P-PCE (PCE5) sends the initiate request to the child
        PCE (PCE1) via PCInitiate message.

   (3)  The PCE1 further propagates the initiate message to the Ingress
        LSR (PCC).

   (4)  The Ingress LSR initiates the setup of the LSP as per the path
        and reports to the PCE1 the LSP status ("GOING-UP").

   (5)  The PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

   (6)  The Ingress LSR notifies the LSP state to PCE1 when the state is
        "UP".

   (7)  The PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

3.3.1.  Per Domain Stitched LSP

   The hierarchical PCE architecture as per [RFC6805] is primarily used
   for E2E LSP.  With PCE-Initiated capability, another mode of
   operation is possible, where multiple intra-domain LSP are initiated



Dhody, et al.            Expires August 16, 2016                [Page 8]


Internet-Draft                STATEFUL-HPCE                February 2016


   in each domain which are further stitched to form an E2E LSP.  The
   P-PCE sends PCInitiate message to each C-PCE separately to
   initiate individual LSP segments along the domain path.  These
   individual per domain LSP are stitched together by some mechanism,
   which is out of scope of this document.

   The following additional steps are also initially performed, 
   for the Per Domain stiched LSP operation, again using the reference
   architecture described in Figure 1 (Sample Hierarchical Domain 
   Topology):

   (1)  The P-PCE (PCE5) is requested to initiate a LSP.

   Steps 4 to 10 of section 4.6.2 of [RFC6805] are executed to determine
   the end to end path, which are broken into per-domain LSPs say -

   o  S-BN41

   o  BN41-BN33

   o  BN33-D

   It should be noted that the P-PCE MAY use other mechanisms to
   determine the suitable per-domain LSPs (apart from [RFC6805]).

   For LSP (BN33-D)

   (2)  The P-PCE (PCE5) sends the initiate request to the child
        PCE (PCE3) via PCInitiate message for LSP (BN33-D).

   (3)  The PCE3 further propagates the initiate message to BN33.

   (4)  BN33 initiates the setup of the LSP as per the path and reports
        to the PCE3 the LSP status ("GOING-UP").

   (5)  The PCE3 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

   (6)  The node BN33 notifies the LSP state to PCE3 when the state is
        "UP".

   (7)  The PCE3 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

   For LSP (BN41-BN33)

   (8)  The P-PCE (PCE5) sends the initiate request to the child
        PCE (PCE4) via PCInitiate message for LSP (BN41-BN33).

   (9)  The PCE4 further propagates the initiate message to BN41.

Internet-Draft                STATEFUL-HPCE                February 2016


   (10)  BN41 initiates the setup of the LSP as per the path and reports
        to the PCE4 the LSP status ("GOING-UP").

   (11)  The PCE4 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

   (l2)  The node BN41 notifies the LSP state to PCE4 when the state is
        "UP".

   (13)  The PCE4 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

   For LSP (S-BN41)

   (14)  The P-PCE (PCE5) sends the initiate request to the child
        PCE (PCE1) via PCInitiate message for LSP (S-BN41).

   (15)  The PCE1 further propagates the initiate message to node S.

   (16)  S initiates the setup of the LSP as per the path and reports to
        the PCE1 the LSP status ("GOING-UP").

   (17)  The PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

   (18)  The node S notifies the LSP state to PCE1 when the state is
        "UP".

   (19)  The PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

   Additionally: 

   (20)  once P-PCE receives report of each per-domain LSP, it
        should use some stitching mechanism, which is out of scope of
        this document.

4.  Other Considerations

4.1.  Applicability to Inter-Layer

   [RFC5623] describes a framework for applying the PCE-based
   architecture to inter-layer (G)MPLS traffic engineering.  The H-PCE
   Stateful architecture with stateful P-PCE coordinating with the
   stateful C-PCEs of higher and lower layer is shown in the figure
   below.

   All procedures described in Section 3 are applicable to inter-layer
   path setup as well.

4.2.  Applicability to ACTN

   [I-D.ceccarelli-teas-actn-framework] describes framework for
   Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN), where each Physical
   Network Controller (PNC) is equivalent to C-PCE and P-PCE is
   the Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC).  The Per domain stitched
   LSP as per the Hierarchical PCE architecture described in
   Section 3.3.1 and Section 4.1 is well suited for ACTN.

   In ACTN framework, Customer Network Controller (CNC) can request the
   MDSC to check if there is a possibility to meet Virtual Network (VN)
   requirements (before requesting for VN provision).  The H-PCE
   architecture as described in [RFC6805] can supports via the use of
   PCReq and PCRep messages between the P-PCE and C-PCEs.
