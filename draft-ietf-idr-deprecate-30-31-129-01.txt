1.  Introduction

   It has been discovered that certain BGP Path Attribute values have
   been used in BGP implementations which have been deployed in the wild
   while not being assigned by the IANA for such usage.  Unregistered
   usage of BGP Path Attribute values can lead to deployment problems
   for new technologies.

   The use of these unregistered values was noticed when BGP Large
   Communities attribute [I-D.ietf-idr-large-community] was initially
   assigned value 30 by IANA.  It was subsequently discovered that a
   widely-deployed BGP-4 [RFC4271] implementation had released code
   which used path attribute 30 and which applied a "Treat-as-withdraw"
   [RFC7606] strategy to routes containing a valid Large Community
   attribute, since it was expecting a different data structure.
   Because these routes were dropped, early adopters of Large
   Communities were unreachable from parts of the Internet.  As a
   workaround, a new Early IANA Allocation was requested.

   The squatting of values 30, 31, 129, 241, 242 and 243 has been
   confirmed by the involved vendors or through source code review.

2.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, IANA is requested to mark values 30, 31, 129, 241,
   242, and 243 as "deprecated" in the "BGP Path Attributes" registry
   under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" group.  The
   marking "deprecated" meaning "use is not recommended"
   ([I-D.leiba-cotton-iana-5226bis]).

3.  Security Considerations

   There are no meaningful security consequences arising from this
   registry update.
