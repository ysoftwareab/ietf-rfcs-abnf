Internet-Draft     XCAP Usage for Presence Publishing       October 2003


1. Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Instant Messaging and
   Presence (SIMPLE) specifications allow a user, called a watcher, to
   subscribe to another user, called a presentity [6], in order to learn
   their presence information [7].

   The presence information is published by the user, called a
   publisher. The presence server (PS) and presence agent (PA) have
   access to the stored presence information. A SIP based mechanism has
   been specified for publishing soft state type of presence information
   [13]. However, there is also a need to manage such presence
   information which neither requires refreshing nor needs definition of
   the expiry time, e.g., the presence information of a closed
   communication mean or some other more stabile information. Examples
   include for instance presentity's e-mail or homepage address. This
   kind of information is normally managed only when there is a need to
   change the content. Such information is called hard state type of
   presence information in this document.

   XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) [2] allows a client to read,
   write and modify application configuration data, stored in XML format
   on a server. The data has no expiration time, so it must be
   explicitly inserted and deleted. It is possible to manipulate the
   same data by multiple clients. With these properties XCAP fulfills
   the requirements of hard state information publishing. Another
   advantage is that XCAP is used in SIP-based presence systems also for
   manipulation of presence lists and presence authorization policies.

   This document defines an XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP)
   application usage for manipulating hard state type of presence
   information. CPIM PIDF [3] presence document format, which is used
   for soft state information, is reused for hard state presence in
   order to make the combination of different types of information
   easier.

   Section 3 introduces a framework how XCAP-based hard state presence
   information publishing is related to soft state publishing done with
   SIP.

   XCAP requires application usages to standardize several pieces of
   information, including an application unique ID (AUID), an XML
   schema, and various other information. These pieces of information
   are specified starting from the Section 4.

2. Conventions

   In this document, the key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED',



Isomaki & Leppanen       Expires April 2, 2004                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     XCAP Usage for Presence Publishing       October 2003


   'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY',
   and 'OPTIONAL' are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1]
   and indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

   Comprehensive terminology of presence and event state publishing is
   provided in [13].

3. Framework

   The framework for publishing presence state is introduced in [12]. A
   central part of the framework is the event state compositor element
   which function is to compose presence information received from
   serveral sources.

   The hard state information can be seen as one of the information
   sources for the compositor to be combined with the soft state
   information published using SIP PUBLISH [13]. This is illustrated in
   the figure below. In order to make the combination easier, hard state
   information uses the same format as soft state information, namely
   CPIM PIDF and any of its extensions.



               +---------------+         +------------+
               |   Event State |         |  Presence  |--> SIP Subscribe
               |   Compositor  +---------+  Agent     |<-- SIP Notify
               |               |         |   (PA)     |
               +-------+-------+         +------------+
                       |
                       |
                       |             +---------------+
        +--------------^-------------|  XCAP server  |
        |              |             +-------+-------+
        |              |                     ^
        | SIP Publish  |                     | XCAP Publish
        |              |                     |
     +--+--+        +--+--+         +--------+--------------+
     | PUA |        | PUA |         | XCAP presence-publish |
     |     |        |     |         | client                |
     +-----+        +-----+         +-----------------------+


                   Figure 1: Framework for Publishing


   How the compositor combines the hard state information with the soft
   state information to form a coherent presence document is entirely a
   matter of local policy, and is beyond the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft     XCAP Usage for Presence Publishing       October 2003


4. Application Unique ID

   XCAP requires application usages to define a unique application usage
   ID (AUID) in either the IETF tree or a vendor tree. This
   specification defines the 'presence-publish' AUID within the IETF
   tree, via the IANA registration in the Section 13.

5. Structure of Published Presence Information

   The XML [5] format of the presence information (PIDF) is defined in
   [3] and its extensions. The PIDF defines the presence information to
   consist of the root element 'presence' including 'tuples' which
   contain a mandatory status element, a communication mean specific
   presence attribute and other markups. Additionally, the presence
   information can contain other presentity level information outside
   tuples.

   The namespace URI for PIDF is defined in [3].

6. Computed Data

   There are no computed data on the document beyond those described in
   the schema.

7. Additional Constraints

   There are no constraints on the document beyond those described in
   the XML schemas and [3].

8. Naming Conventions

   There are no naming conventions beyond the possible conventions
   defined in [3] that need to be defined for this application usage.

9. Authorization Policies

   This application usage does not modify the default XCAP authorization
   policy, which allows only a user (a publisher) to read, write or
   modify their own documents. A server can allow privileged users to
   modify documents that they don't own, but the establishment and
   indication of such policies is outside the scope of this document.

10. XML Schema

   The XML schema definition for the presence information can be found
   from [3] and its extensions. At the time of writing this draft the
   following extensions have been specified: [10] and [11].

Internet-Draft     XCAP Usage for Presence Publishing       October 2003


11. Example Document

   The following example document defines the default state of the
   presentity's presence information. In the absence of any published
   soft state information, this would be the sole input to the
   compositor forming the presence document. The example document
   contain PIDF extensions specified in [10] and [11].

12. Security Considerations

   The configuration information defined by this application usage is
   particularly sensitive. It represents the set of presence information
   which is delivered to watchers according to specific authorization
   policies. As a result, clients SHOULD use TLS when contacting servers
   in order to fetch this information. Also if the server delivers
   presence information using the XCAP protocol it must be done
   according to the defined authorization policy.

13. IANA Considerations

   There are an IANA consideration associated with this specification.

13.1 XCAP Application Usage ID

   This section registers a new XCAP Application Usage ID (AUID)
   according to the IANA procedures defined in [2].

   Name of the AUID: presence-publish

   Description: A presence-publish application is a usage of the publish
   framework for managing hard state type of presence information using
   XCAP.

14. Open Issues

   Publishing of external content: how to publish external content
   (e.g., an icon) referenced from PIDF in case of the XCAP based
   publishing? Is the content transported separately from the PIDF
   formatted document so that the PIDF includes only a reference to the
   separately transported content and the compositor is capable for
   linking the information together? This might require that the

   compositor is able to change the content of the reference.
