Abstract 
    
   This document provides an evaluation of the applicability of three 
   proposed approaches for a ForCES protocol: FACT[2], GRMP[3], and 
   Netlink2[4]. A summary of each of the proposed protocols against the 
   ForCES requirements[5] and the ForCES framework[6] is provided. 
   Compliancy of each of the protocols against each requirement is 
   detailed.  A conclusion summarizes how each of the protocols fares in 
   the evaluation.

1.   Introduction 
    
   This document provides an evaluation of the applicability of FACT, 
   GRMP, and Netlink2 as the ForCES protocol.  This evaluation provides 
   overviews of the protocols and general statements of applicability 
   based upon the ForCES framework and requirements documents. The 
   format and structure as well as some of the introductory content of 
   this document is based on and taken from a similar document being 
   produced in the MIDCOM working group[8].

   The process for protocol evaluation found in this document consists 
   of individuals providing sections evaluating a specific protocol.  
   These sections are incorporated by the editor of the document, and 
   are subject to feedback and changes based on the consensus of the 
   ForCES working group.  Some protocols that might be considered as 
   potentially applicable as the ForCES protocol are not evaluated in 
   this document since there where no champions to submit evaluations 
   for them.  
    
   Section 2 of this document contains a list of the proposed protocols 
   along with background information about the protocols. 
    
   Section 3 of this document contains an item level evaluation of the 
   proposed protocols against the architectural requirements found in 
   section 5 of the ForCES requirements. The purpose of this section is 
   to determine how well each of the proposed protocols maps to the 
   ForCES architecture. 
    
   Section 4 of this document contains an item level evaluation of the 
   proposed protocols against the model requirements found in ForCES 
   requirements.  The purpose of this section is to determine how well 
   each of the proposed protocols can be used with FEs that meet the 
   ForCES model requirements.   
    
   Section 5 of this document contains an item level evaluation of the 
   proposed protocols against the protocol requirements found in the 
   ForCES requirements.  The purpose of this section is to determine how 
   well each of the proposed protocols satisfies each of the protocol 
   requirements.  
    
Section 6 summarizes the evaluation, and includes a table with a 
breakdown for each of the protocols versus the requirements. The 
following categories of compliance are used: Fully met, partially met 
through the use of extensions, partially met through other changes to 
the protocol, or not met. This summary is not a conclusive statement of 
the suitability of the protocols, but rather to provide information to 
be considered as input into the overall protocol decision process. 
    
    
2.   Protocol Proposals 
    
   The following protocols have been submitted to the ForCES WG for 
   consideration: 
      o FACT 
      o GRMP 
      o Netlink2 
    
   The following sections provide overviews of each of the protocols as 
   well as relevant background information about each protocol.

3.   Architectural Requirements Compliance Evaluation 
    
   This section contains a review of each protocol proposal∆s level of 
   compliance to the ForCES architecture requirements.  Many of the 
   architectural requirements will be instantiated in some fashion in 
   the protocol selected.  Given that the architectural requirements are 
   not direct protocol requirements, the review below will consist of 
   prose rather than specific levels of compliance as is used in the 
   protocol section below.

4.   Model Requirements Compliance Evaluation 
    
   This section contains a review of each protocol∆s level of compliance 
   to the ForCES model requirements.  The ForCES model will indirectly 
   relate to the protocol in that the protocol will be used to carry 
   information that the model represents.  Given that the model 
   requirements are only indirectly related to the protocol selection, 
   the review below will consist of prose rather than specific levels of 
   compliance as is used in the protocol section below.

5.   Protocol Requirements Compliance Evaluation 
    
   This section contains a review of each protocol∆s level of compliance 
   to the ForCES protocol requirements.  Given that the protocol 
   requirements are directly related to the protocol proposals, a very 
   concrete method is used in reviewing compliance - the following key 
   identifies the level of compliance for each of the following 
   protocols to each protocol requirement in the ForCES requirements 
   RFC: 
    
   T = Total compliance. Meets the requirement fully. 
    
   P+ = Partial compliance. Fundamentally meets the requirement through 
   the use of extensions (e.g. packages, additional parameters, etc.) 
    
   P = Partial compliance. Meets some aspect of the requirement, 
   however, the necessary changes require more than an extension and/or 
   are inconsistent with the design intent of the protocol. 
    
   N = Not compliant.  Does not meet the requirement.

Security Considerations 
    
   This document is a comparison between three protocols in order to 
   help in the selection of the best approach to use as the ForCES 
   protocol.  Security considerations are addressed in each of the 
   protocol proposals and MUST be included as part of the fitness 
   evaluation for each proposal.
