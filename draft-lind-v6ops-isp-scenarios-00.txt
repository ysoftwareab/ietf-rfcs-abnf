Abstract 
    
   This document describes different scenarios for the introduction of 
   IPv6 in an IPv4 ISP network. The goal is the addition of a native 
   IPv6 service to the already existing IPv4 service without 
   interruption of the IPv4 service. During the IPv6 introduction the 
   network can go through 4 different stages including the initial IPv4 
   only stage. To move between the stages there will be some form of 
   transition that can be defined in different transition scenarios.

1.   Introduction 
    
   An ISP offering an IPv4 service will find that there are different 
   ways to add IPv6 to this service. During the introduction of IPv6 the 
   network will go through different stages of IPv6 maturity. In 
   addition to this there has to be a transition between these stages to 
   make them feasible to implement. In some cases it might not be 
   possible to introduce IPv6 as a native part of the network, due to 
   hardware limitations or similar. Instead some coexistence mechanism 
   has to be used.  
   This leaves two choices; a native IPv6 transport in a part of the 
   network or some mechanism to transport IPv6 over the existing IPv4 
   network. From the customer perspective this can be seen as the ISP 
   offering a native IPv6 service or not depending on what is relevant 
   in the access network. If the ISP is not offering native IPv6 
   transport, then the service is limited in the sense that the customer 
   has to have a dual stack network, or some kind of coexistence 
   mechanism.   
   In this document different transition scenarios and situations during 
   the introduction of IPv6 are covered in a broader perspective and 
   deals only with a generic view of how an ISP network is build. This 
   should be seen as the starting point for further documentation of how 
   the introduction of IPv6 can be done in an ISP network in companion. 
   What also will be included in these documents are issues specific to 
   different network configurations and special network equipment. This 
   document should therefore be seen as the working frame for the 
   transition steps of the IPv6 introduction that will be documented in 
   companion documents.

2.   Scope 
    
   The scope of the document is to describe different cases for the 
   introduction of an IPv6 service in a generic IPv4 ISP network. This 
   means that the document will be limited to services that include both 
   IPv6 and IPv4 and will not cover issues surrounding an IPv6 only 
   service. The scope also includes transition scenarios between the 
   different stages. The different building blocks that will be 
   considered are a customer network, an access network, a core network 
   and exchange points. It is outside the scope of this document to 
   describe different types of access or network technologies. It is 
   also outside of the scope to propose different solutions. Solutions 
   will be covered in a separate document. 
    
3.   Brief description of a generic ISP network 
    
   A generic ISP network topology can be divided into two main parts; 
   core network and access network. The core network or the backbone is 
   the part of the network that interconnects the different access 
   networks and provides transport to the rest of the Internet via 
   exchange points or other means. The core network can be built on 
   different technologies but in this document the only interest is 
   whether it is capable of carrying IPv6 traffic natively or not. The 
   same applies to the access network. The access network provides 
   connectivity to enterprise and private customers. Other ISPs might as 
   well be customers and connected to the ISP's network.

   It doesn't matter if these customer networks have a single node or a 
   large routed network. What is of interest is if routing information 
   is exchanged or not since it will affect the ISP's network. The 
   existence of customer placed equipment will also affect how a service 
   can be delivered. In addition to the ISP's actual network components 
   there are a lot of support and backend systems that have to be 
   considered.  
                                                                    
4.   Stages 
    
   The stages here are snapshots of an ISP's network with respect to 
   IPv6 maturity. Since an ISP's network is constantly evolving, a stage 
   is a measure of how far an ISP has come in turn of implementing 
   necessary functionality to offer IPv6 to the customers. 
    
   It is possible to freely transition between different stages. 
   However, a network segment can only be in one stage at a time but an 
   ISP network as a whole can be in different stages. There are 
   different transition paths between the first and final stage. The 
   transition between two stages does not have to be immediate but can 
   occur gradually.   
    
   Each stage has different IPv6 properties. An ISP can therefore, based 
   on the requirements it has, decide into which stage it will transform 
   its network. 
    
4.1    Assumptions 
    
   The stages are derived from the generic description of an ISP network 
   in section 3. A combination of different building blocks that 
   constitute an ISP environment will lead to a number of scenarios, 
   which an ISP can choose from. The scenarios of most relevance to this 
   document are considered to be the ones that in the most efficient and 
   feasible way maximizes the ability for an ISP to offer IPv6 to its 
   customers. 
    
   The most predominant case today is considered to be an operator with 
   a core and access IPv4 network delivering IPv4 service to a customer 
   that is running IPv4 as well. At some point in the future, it is 
   expected that the customer will want to have an IPv6 service, in 
   addition to the already existing IPv4 service. The challenge for the 
   ISP is to deliver the requested IPv6 service over the existing 
   infrastructure and at the same time keep the IPv4 service intact. The 
   next step, which is not covered in this document, will be to remove 
   the IPv4 service when there no longer is a demand for it or deliver 
   the IPv4 service over an IPv6 only network.

INTERNET DRAFT       ISP Networks IPv6 Scenarios            June 2003 

4.2    Customer requirements and ISP offerings 
    
   Looking at the scenarios from the end customer's perspective there 
   might be a demand for three different services; the customer might 
   demand IPv4 service, IPv6 service or both services. This can lead to 
   two scenarios depending on the stage the ISP's network is in. 
    
   If an ISP only offer IPv4 or IPv6 service and a customer wants to 
   connect a device or network that only supports one service and if 
   that service is not offered, it will lead to a dead-end. If the 
   customer or ISP instead connects a dual stack device it is possible 
   to circumvent the lack of the missing service in the access network 
   by using some kind of coexistence mechanism. This scenario will only 
   be considered in the perspective of the ISP offering a mechanism to 
   bridge the access and reach the IPv6 core. 
    
   In the case where the customer connects a single stack device to a 
   corresponding single stack access network, there will be no problem 
   from the customer's perspective. The same is valid if a single stack 
   device is connected to a dual stack access network. Therefore, 
   neither of these cases need further be explored in this document but 
   can be seen as a part of a full dual stack case. 
    
   After eliminating a number of cases explained above, there are four 
   stages that are most probable and where an ISP will find its network 
   in. Which stage a network is in; depend on whether or not some part 
   of the network previously has been upgraded to support IPv6 or if it 
   is easier to enable IPv6 in one part or another. For instance, 
   routers in the core might have IPv6 support or might be easily 
   upgradeable, while the hardware in the access might have to be 
   completely replaced in order to handle IPv6 traffic. 
    
   Note that in every stage except Stage 1, the ISP can offer both IPv4 
   and IPv6 services to the customer. 
    
   The four most probable stages are: 
      Stage 1  û Launch 
      Stage 2a û Core 
      Stage 2b û Access 
      Stage 3  û Complete 
    
4.3    Stage 1 û Launch 
    
   The first stage is an IPv4 only ISP with an IPv4 customer. This is 
   the most common case today and has to be the starting point for the 
   introduction of IPv6. From this stage, an ISP can move (transition) 
   to any other stage with the goal to offer IPv6 to its customer.

4.4    Stage 2a - Core 
    
   Stage 2a is an ISP with an access network that is IPv4 only and a 
   core that is IPv4 and IPv6. In this stage the customer should have 
   support for both IPv4 and IPv6 and use a coexistence mechanism to be 
   able to run the IPv6 service. To offer the IPv6 service, the ISP also 
   has to connect to an IPv6 exchange point or somehow else exchange 
   IPv6 traffic with other ISPs.

       Figure 3. Upgraded core 
    
4.5    Stage 2b - Access 
     
   Stage 2b is an ISP with a core network that is IPv4 and an access 
   that is IPv4 and IPv6. Since the service to the customer is native 
   IPv6 there is no requirement for the customer to support both IPv4 
   and IPv6. This is the biggest difference in comparison to the 
   previous stage. The need to exchange IPv6 traffic or similar still 
   exists but might be more complicated than in the previous case since 
   the core isn't IPv6 enabled.

4.6    Stage 3 û Complete 
    
   Stage 3 can be said to be the final step in introducing IPv6, at 
   least in the scope of this document. This is an all over IPv6 service 
   with native support for IPv6 and IPv4 in both core and access 
   networks. This stage is identical to the previous stage in the

   customer's perspective since the access network hasn't changed. The 
   connection to the IPv6 exchange point is identical to stage 2.

    ------     ------     ------     ------ 
       Figure 5. Completely upgraded network 
    
4.7    Future stages 
    
   After a while the ISP might want to transition to a service that is 
   IPv6 only, at least in certain parts of the network. This transition 
   creates a lot of new cases in which to factor in how to maintain the 
   IPv4 service. Providing an IPv6 only service is not much different 
   than the dual IPv4/IPv6 service described in stage 3 except from the 
   need to phase out the IPv4 service. The delivery of IPv4 services 
   over an IPv6 network and the phase out will be left for a future 
   document.  
    
5.   Transition Scenarios 
    
   Given the different stages it is clear that the ISP has to be able to 
   transition from one stage to another. The initial stage, in this 
   document, is the IPv4 only service and network. The end stage is the 
   dual IPv4/IPv6 service and network. As mentioned in the scope, this 
   document does not cover the IPv6 only service and network and its 
   implications on IPv4 customers. This has nothing to do with the 
   usability of an IPv6 only service.  
    
   The transition starts out with the IPv4 ISP and then moves to one of 
   three choices. These choices are the different transition scenarios. 
   One way would be to upgrade the core first which leads to stage 2a.  
   Another way to go could be to upgrade the access network which leads 
   to stage 2b. The final possibility is to introduce IPv6 in the whole 
   network at once which would lead to stage 3.  
    
   The choice is dependent on many different issues. For example it 
   might not be possible to upgrade the core or the access network 
   without large investments in new equipment which could lead to any of 
   the two first choices. In another case it might be easier to take the 
   direct step to a complete IPv6/IPv4 network due to routing protocol 
   issues or similar.  
    
   If a partially upgraded network (stage 2a or 2b) was chosen as the 
   first step, a second step remains before the network is all over 
   native IPv6/IPv4. This is the transition to an all over dual stack 

 
 
Lind                   Expires - December 2003               [Page 7]

   network. This step is perhaps not necessary for stage 2b with an 
   already native IPv6 service to the customer but might still occur 
   when the timing is right. For stage 2a it is more obvious that a 
   transition to a dual stack network is necessary since it has to be 
   done to offer a native IPv6 service.     
    
6.   Security Considerations 
    
   This document describes different cases for the introduction of IPv6 
   in an IPv4 ISP network. Solutions are described in other documents 
   hence this document has no security considerations.
