1. Introduction 

   Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is a technology for optical 
   communications, in which the user traffic is carried by different 
   data channels of optical wavelengths. In traditional WDM Networks, 
   each wavelength path is statically configured. With the deployment of 
   the Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) and the 
   Wavelength Selective Switch (WSS), WDM networks have become more 
   dynamic, and operators can flexibly set up wavelength paths to carry 
   user traffic.

   [WSON-FRAME] provides control plane models for key wavelength 
   switched optical network subsystems and processes. Section 5.2 of 
   [WSON-FRAME] describes the subsystem properties which may be conveyed 
   via an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP). 

   This document discusses the set of IGP requirements that would enable 
   distributed light path computation in Wavelength Switched Optical 
   Networks (WSON). An IGP impact analysis is also provided. According 
   to the analysis, there is no significant impact on the IGP 
   performance. 

   This document is currently limited to consideration of single 
   component links per TE link. Link Bundles are for future 
   consideration.

   Figure 1 shows a typical WDM node, which consists of a Wavelength 
   Switch module, a Multiplexer/DeMultiplexer module, and a Wavelength 
   Converter module. In this example, there are four directions on the 
   line side, and four add/drop directions on the tributary side. 

   For example, in a 160-wavelength system, each fiber of the line side 
   contains 160 wavelengths, and traffic can be carried by each 
   wavelength. The wavelength can be switched to a different direction 
   (or a different fiber) at the WDM node. 

   Moreover, if the WDM node has the wavelength conversion capability, 
   one wavelength can be switched to a different wavelength of a 
   different direction. But there may be a limitation for wavelength 
   conversion, so that not every wavelength can be switched to any other 
   wavelength on any other fiber. 

3. Wavelength Conversion Constraints 

   For each WDM node, not all the wavelengths on a fiber can necessarily 
   be converted to any other wavelength on any other fiber. For example, 
   lambda 1 on an incoming fiber might only be convertable to lambda 2, 
   lambda 3, or lambda 4 on a particular outgoing fiber, and cannot be 
   converted to lambda 5 or other wavelengths on that outgoing fiber. 

   The wavelength conversion constraints directly affect the potential 
   connectivity of wavelengths in WSON. There are three kinds of 
   wavelength conversion capabilities: 

   o No wavelength conversion. 

   o Partial wavelength conversion. Some of the wavelengths can be 
      converted to different wavelengths. 

   o Full wavelength conversion. All of the wavelengths can be 
      converted to any wavelengths. 

   If no wavelength conversion is possible, there may be three more 
   cases: 

   o Each of the wavelengths on one fiber can only be connected to the 
      same wavelength on some other fibers.  

   o Some subset of wavelengths on one fiber can be connected only as a 
      set to the same wavelengths on some other fibers.  

   o A particular wavelength on one fiber can be connected only to the 
      same wavelength on another specific fiber.

4. Available wavelength information 

   In order to perform end-to-end wavelength computation, the wavelength 
   label is certainly convenient to have global semantics, but it is not 
   necessary. For example, an NMS could know the details of each NE and 
   perform its own mappings between the local significance wavelength 
   labels. So the collection of potential wavelength connectivity 
   information, wavelength path computation, and signaling the 
   wavelength path, all could be solved by local wavelength label 
   mappings performed by NMS. In order to avoid such complicated and 
   potentially error-prone operations, it is desirable to use the same 
   semantics for the wavelength label on every hop. 

   For example, the wavelength label range [lambda 1, lambda 5] of fiber 
   1 can be connected to the same wavelength label range of fiber 2. But 
   only lambda 3 is available to carry the traffic, other wavelength 
   labels are occupied. In order to compute a wavelength path, available 
   wavelength information needs to be known by the node performing the 
   computation. 

   If the wavelength availability information is not known by the node 
   performing the path computation, then the computation can only be 
   performed at the level of TE links, and wavelength assignment must be 
   resolved locally by the switches on a hop-by-hop basis enhanced by 
   signaling protocol mechanisms used to negotiate label selection. 
   However, this case may be very inefficient in the signaling protocol, 
   and can easily lead to blocking problems where a path is selected for 
   which there is no suitable wavelength availability, unless some or 
   all of the switches along the path are capable of full wavelength 
   conversion. In the general case of limited or no wavelength 
   conversion, information on wavelength availability is essential to 
   perform efficient and accurate path computation. 

5. Requirements for IGP Extension 

   In WSON, wavelength path computations based on the data link topology 
   and the TE link states alone cannot guarantee that computed 
   wavelength paths can actually be successfully established. The 
   following three factors should also be considered in wavelength path 
   computation: 

   o Wavelength conversion constraints 

   o Wavelength connectivity 

   o Per-fiber wavelength availability information.

Internet-Draft   draft-li-ccamp-wson-igp-eval-01.txt         July 2008 
    

   Each WDM node has this information about its own fibers, but the 
   information needs to be distributed to the points of computation. 

   The IGP that is already used to advertise TE information within the 
   WSON is a candidate solution to distribute this constraint 
   information. If the IGP were to be used in this way then the 
   following requirements would need to be applied: 

   o The constraint information should be small, so that it must not 
      affect the performance of IGP;  

   o IGP extension should support all kinds of wavelength conversion 
      capabilities;  

   o IGP extension should support the scalability of different 
      wavelength multiplexer systems, such as 40-wavelength WDM, 80-
      wavelength WDM, and 160-wavelength WDM; 

6. Assessment of the WDM node constraint information 

   When computing an available wavelength from source to destination, 
   two types of information are needed along with potential paths. One 
   is available wavelength information in all the fibers, the other is 
   the potential wavelength connectivity in all the nodes. 

   In a deployed WDM network, the information which is required to 
   compute a wavelength path consists of: 

   o Potential wavelength connectivity information (Including 
      Wavelength conversion constraints and Wavelength connectivity 
      mentioned in section 5.) 

   o Wavelength status information  i,e, Per-fiber wavelength 
      availability information . 

6.1. Potential Wavelength Connectivity Information  

   The wavelength that an optical fiber can support is pre-configured, 
   static information. This information needs to be advertised only once 
   in the general case, because it is not expected to change frequently 
   when the network is running. 

   This information should be advertised again, only if: 

   o The link is updated to support more or fewer wavelengths;  

   o The link is changed to use a new wavelength band;  
 
 
Li, Lee, and Gao      Expires January 11, 2009                [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft   draft-li-ccamp-wson-igp-eval-01.txt         July 2008 
    

   o The switch at the end of the link runs out of shared wavelength 
      conversion capability (for example, uses up all capacity on a 
      switch fabric) which will affect the potential wavelength 
      connectivity. 

   For a fiber which can support 160 wavelengths, the size of wavelength 
   information supported by the fiber reaches about 160*4 = 640 bytes, 
   where each wavelength is identified by the wavelength label format 
   defined in [G.694-Label]. 

   For a fiber that can support 160 wavelengths, and considering a node 
   that has wavelength conversion capability, the size of potential 
   wavelength connectivity information of each fiber pair may be as much 
   as 3200 bytes: 

   Input fiber = lambda 1, lambda 2, ..., lambda 160 

   Output fiber = lambda 1, lambda 2, ..., lambda 160 

   So the 160x160 matrix (M[160,160]) can be represented by a bitmap. 
   For example, if lambda 1 of Input fiber can be connected or converted 
   to lambda 4 of Output fiber, then M[1,4] is set to 1. Otherwise, 
   M[1,4] is set to 0. The bit-matrix is correlated to the static list 
   of wavelengths available on the fiber as described earlier in this 
   section. 

   Total size = 160 * 160 / 8 = 3200 bytes. 

   This information is not expected to change frequently. It can be 
   advertised just once. Further more, by applying some encoding or 
   compression algorithm, the size of this information may be reduced a 
   lot. 

   The wavelength conversion capability is not supported at all nodes in 
   a WSON. It may be the case that only a few WDM nodes support 
   wavelength conversion. In this case, for most of the WDM nodes, the 
   potential wavelength connectivity information may be simplified to 
   the following information: 

   o Input fiber and Output fiber with full wavelength range; 

   or, 

   o Input fiber and Output fiber with a specific wavelength range 
      (from lambda m to lambda n);

   o The wavelength connectivity between input fiber and output fiber 
      including wavelength switch capability and wavelength conversion 
      constraints. 

6.2. Wavelength Status Information  

   In WSON, the status information of a certain wavelength in a fiber 
   should be refreshed following any change. When a wavelength is 
   assigned to set up a wavelength LSP or released when a wavelength LSP 
   is torn down, the status information of this wavelength on each link 
   along the path should be updated. This information is dynamic 
   information and needs to be distributed to all computation points.  

   To minimize the size of information, we can use a bitmap to indicate 
   the wavelength status information of a fiber, i.e. only one bit is 
   used to indicate the status of a certain wavelength (the wavelength 
   is either available or not available). The bitmap is correlated to 
   the static wavelength list described in Section 6.1.  

   For a fiber which can support 160 wavelengths, the size of the 
   wavelength status information of a fiber is only 20 bytes. So it 
   should not impact the IGP performance to advertise this information.  

6.3. IGP Extensions  

   A new Opaque LSA can be introduced to carry wavelength information of 
   a fiber and potential wavelength connectivity information of node.

   Indicates there is no blocking for the any wavelength of each pair of 
   TE links. In this case, any wavelength of this link can be switched 
   or converted to any wavelength of the reachable link, and the 
   following bitmap may not need to be presented. 

   11 = Reserved 

   C: 1 bit 

   Data compressed indicated bit 

   0 = Not compressed 

   Indicates the bitmap list data has not been compressed.  

   1 = Compressed 

   Indicates that the bitmap list data has been compressed by the 
   algorithm denoted per "Z" field. 

   Z: 4 bit 

   Compression Algorithm (TDB)

   Indicates which compression algorithm has been applied when the "C" 
   bit is set to 1. 

   W: 3 bit 

   Indicates how many bits are used to indicate the potential 
   connectivity information in the bitmap list data. Usually "W" is set 
   to 0, which indicates only one bit is used. This field can provide 
   the flexibility of bitmap list. For example, when we want to indicate 
   the temporary connection for testing, only one bit is not enough. 

   Reserved: 31 bits 

   This field is reserved. It MUST be set to 0 on transmission and MUST 
   be ignored on receipt. 

   Row: 16 bits 

   Indicates the number of rows in the matrix. This has the same value 
   as the count of wavelengths supported by this fiber (Lambda_num in 
   the wavelength information sub-TLV). 

   Column: 16 bits 

   Indicates the number of columns in the matrix. This has the same 
   value as the number of wavelengths of the TE link identified by 
   Reachable_link ID. 

   Reachable link ID: 32 bits  

   Indicates the TE link denoted by this format to which this matrix 
   applies. It is a 32 bit Unnumbered Interface ID. 

   Bitmap list: Variable Length 

   The matrix indicates the potential connectivity from lambdas on the 
   TE link denoted by this format, to Reachable link ID. Each bit or 
   each set of bits indicates the potential connectivity of a certain 
   wavelength pair indicated by M[m n]. If there has a potential 
   connectivity, the corresponding bit(s) are set to 1; otherwise they 
   are set to 0. Indexes start at 1 and run to the count of wavelength 
   on each fiber. The bit indicated by M[m n] is located at offset (m-
   1)*32+n from the first bit when we use one bit to indicate the 
   potential connectivity information. 

   Padded bit: Variable Length

   It is used to pad the bit to make the whole number of bits in the 
   bitmap to be a multiple of 32. Padded bits MUST be set to 0.  

   The bit-matrix compression techniques will be discussed in a future 
   version of this document. 

6.3.3. Wavelength Status Information 

   A new TE link sub-TLV of an Opaque LSA can be introduced to carry the 
   wavelength status information.

    W: 3 bit 

   Indicates how many bits are used to denote the wavelength status 
   information. Usually "W" is set to 0, which indicates only one bit is 
   used to indicate if the wavelength is assigned. 

   Wavelength Status Length: 16 bits  

   Indicates the number of the wavelength of each TE link. 

   Wavelength Status Data: Variable Length 

   Each bit or several bits (indicated by "W") indicate the availability 
   status of one wavelength. 

   In the case of W = 1: 

   1 = Available 

   0 = Assigned (in use, or failed, or administratively down, or under 
   testing); 

   In the case of W = [2,8], TBD. 

   Padded bit: Variable Length

   It is used to pad the bit to make the whole number of bits in bitmap 
   be the time of 32. Padded bit MUST be set to 0. 

7. Security Considerations 

   TBD. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   This requirement document makes no requests for IANA action.
