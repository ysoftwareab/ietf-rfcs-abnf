             Signaling MSD (Maximum SID Depth) using IS-IS
                 draft-ietf-isis-segment-routing-msd-03

Abstract

   This document proposes a way to signal Maximum SID Depth (MSD)
   supported by a node at node and/or link granularity by an IS-IS
   Router.  In a Segment Routing (SR) enabled network a centralized
   controller that programs SR tunnels needs to know the MSD supported
   by the head-end at node and/or link granularity to push the SID stack
   of an appropriate depth.  MSD is relevant to the head-end of a SR
   tunnel or Binding-SID anchor node where Binding-SID expansions might
   result in creation of a new SID stack.

1.  Introduction

   When Segment Routing tunnels are computed by a centralized
   controller, it is critical that the controller learns the MSD
   "Maximum SID Depth" of the node or link SR tunnel exits over, so the
   SID stack depth of a path computed doesn't exceed the number of SIDs
   the node is capable of imposing.  This document describes how to use
   IS-IS to signal the MSD of a node or link to a centralized
   controller.

   PCEP SR extensions draft [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] signals MSD
   in SR PCE Capability TLV and METRIC Object.  However, if PCEP is not
   supported/configured on the head-end of a SR tunnel or a Binding-SID
   anchor node and controller does not participate in IGP routing, it
   has no way to learn the MSD of nodes and links which has been
   configured.  BGP-LS [RFC7752] defines a way to expose topology and
   associated attributes and capabilities of the nodes in that topology
   to a centralized controller.  MSD signaling by BGP-LS has been
   defined in [I-D.tantsura-idr-bgp-ls-segment-routing-msd].  Typically,

   BGP-LS is configured on a small number of nodes, that do not
   necessarily act as head-ends.  In order, for BGP-LS to signal MSD for
   the all nodes and links in the network MSD is relevant, MSD
   capabilites SHOULD be distributed to every IS-IS router in the
   network.

   [I-D.ietf-isis-mpls-elc] defines Readable Label Depth Capability
   (RLDC) that is used by a head-end to insert Entropy Label (EL) at
   appropriate depth, so it could be read by transit nodes.  MSD in
   contrary signals ability to push SID's stack of a particular depth.

   MSD of type 1 (IANA Registry), called Base MSD, is used to signal the
   total number of SIDs a node is capable of imposing, to be used by a
   path computation element/controller.  In case, there are additional
   labels (e.g. service) that are to be pushed to the stack - this would
   be signaled with an another MSD type (TBD), MSD SHOULD be adjusted to
   reflect that.  In the future, new MSD types could be defined to
   signal additional capabilities: entropy labels, labels that can be
   pushed thru recirculation, or another dataplane e.g IPv6.

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC7981].

3.  Node MSD Advertisement

   A new sub-TLV within the body of IS-IS Router Capability TLV
   [RFC7981], Node MSD sub-TLV is defined to carry the provisioned MSD
   of the router originating the Router Capability TLV.  Node MSD is the
   lowest MSD supported by the node of any interface and can be
   provisioned in IS-IS instance.

        0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                        Figure 1: Node MSD Sub-TLV

   The Type (1 byte) of this sub-TLV is 23 (Suggested value - to be
   assigned by IANA).

   Length is variable (minimum of 2, multiple of 2 octets) and
   represents the total length of value field.

   Value field consists of a 1 octet sub-type (IANA Registry) and 1
   octet value.

   Sub-Type 1 (IANA Section), MSD and the Value field contains maximum
   MSD of the router originating the Router Capability TLV.  Node
   Maximum MSD is a number in the range of 0-254. 0 represents lack of
   the ability to push MSD of any depth; any other value represents that
   of the node.  This value SHOULD represent the lowest value supported
   by node.

   Other Sub-types other than defined above are reserved for future
   extensions.  This sub-TLV is optional.  The scope of the
   advertisement is specific to the deployment.

4.  LINK MSD Advertisement

   A new sub-TLV - Link MSD sub-TLV is defined for TLVs 22, 23, 141,
   222, and 223 to carry the provisioned MSD of the interface associated
   with the link.

                        Figure 2: Link MSD Sub-TLV

   The Type (1 byte) of this sub-TLV is 15 (Suggested value - to be
   assigned by IANA).

   Length is variable and similar to what is defined in Section 3.

   Value field consists of a 1 octet sub-type (IANA Registry) and 1
   octet value.

   Sub-Type 1 (IANA Section), MSD and the Value field contains Link MSD
   of the router originating the corresponding TLV's 22, 23, 141, 222,
   and 223.  Link MSD is a number in the range of 0-254. 0 represents
   lack of the ability to push MSD of any depth; any other value
   represents that of the particular link MSD value.

5.  Node MSD vs Link MSD conflict resolution

   When both Node MSD and Link MSD are present, the value in the Link
   MSD MUST be used.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes a request to IANA to allocate sub-TLV type
   codes for the new sub TLV proposed in Section 3 of this document from
   IS-IS Router Capability TLV Registry as defined by [RFC7981].

   Type: 23 (suggested - to be assigned by IANA)

   Description: Node MSD

   Also for link MSD, we request IANA to allocate new sub-TLV codes as
   defined in Section 4 from Sub-TLVs for TLVs 22, 23, 141, 222 and 223
   registry.

   Type: 15 (suggested - to be assigned by IANA)

   Description: Link MSD

   Per TLV information where LINK MSD sub-TLV can be part of:

   registration procedure is "Expert Review" as defined in [RFC5226].
   Suggested registry name is "MSD Sub-types".  Types are an unsigned 8
   bit number.  The following values are defined by this document
