1. Introduction

   P2P-VoD System with VS and NC [1][2] is a P2P based VoD system which
   uses network coding and video segmentation to promote user experience
   when watching a video.

   In this system, the granularity of random seek is the scene
   information in a video. And scenes of a video are defined by video
   segmentation which can be automatically or manually obtained. Thus,
   the less but efficient seek point can reduce bandwidth consumption
   and workload of the whole P2P network. Furthermore, the utilization
   of network coding is a great help to improve the efficiency of
   content distribution [3]. Introducing network coding-based
   distribution scheme enables us to shorten buffering time before users
   start to view the clips. Meanwhile, it offers better adaptability for
   peer churn when they dynamically join or leave the system.

2. Overview of P2P-VoD System with VS and NC

   In this document, P2P-VoD system is a VoD system based on P2P overlay,
   which uses network coding and video segmentation to promote user
   experience when watching a video.

2.1. System Architecture

   According to the requirement of PPSP peer protocol and PPSP tracker
   protocol, our system takes the similar strategy. Otherwise, NC
   simplifies the scheduling of data transfer between peers. It also
   introduces a scene server to offer scene information. The
   architecture of P2P-VoD System with VS and NC is shown as figure 1.

      Figure 1 The architecture of P2P-VoD System with VS and NC

   Our system has implemented the necessary functions required by PPSP
   protocol and some additional functions to make the system more
   practicability.

   Video server: It supplies the original video stream. Once, enough
   clients request for the video data, the introduction of P2P will
   reduce the pressure of the video server on response to the client.

   Tracker server: It holds the list of the owners who has the full
   video or part of the video. Once a user asks for a video, it will
   request tracker server for peer list.

   Scene server: It provides the scene information when client chooses a
   video. The structure of the scene information will be mentioned in
   the following part.

   Client: It let users have an extra functionality of random seek by
   scene information. Thus, when users want to skip, there are
   references. Therefore, unnecessary seek events can be avoided.

2.2. Some definitions and Key technologies

2.2.1. The structure of Scene information

   P2P-VoD System with VS and NC offers the functionality of random seek
   by scene. As a result, the structure of scene information is defined
   below and the operation of a user is well supported by this kind of
   information.

                Figure 2 The structure of Scene information

   GID  It's the global ID of a video. We use this ID to differ the
   video at server.

   VN: It's the name of a video.

   VL: It's the file length of a video.

   VT: It's the time length of a video.

   UID: It's the owner of a video. Sometimes, a user can publish a video
   so that the video may not stored by server.

   STATUS: It's the type of the video the user owns. It can be PART or
   FULL which means user has part of the video or full video.

   FN: It's the key-frame number of a scene.

   ST: It's the start time of a scene within a video.

   SS: It's the size of a scene picture which includes the height and
   width information.

   SCENE DATA: It's the data of a scene picture.

2.2.2. Structure of video-data buffer

   A dynamic way is used in the buffer strategy. When a video is
   requested, a header is first been allocated instead of traditional
   way of allocating the same size of a video. Then, new coming video-
   data is appended to the previous video-data and the block offset is
   recorded in the header. Therefore, user will not pay for the non-
   coming video data.

   GID: it's the global ID of the video file.

   STATUS: reserved.

   EXN: it's the extension of the video file.

   RS: it's the reserved space for extension use.

   Data Block: it's the video data divided by block size.

2.2.3. Network Coding

   Network coding (NC) is introduced into this system. Therefore, every
   peer sends and receives both video-clip and scene information data
   after filtered by the network coding codec module.

   One block of data encoded by the module has some intersect
   information over the generation the block belongs to. In this way,
   each block within a generation acts equally to others and thus a
   method of Push-Based distributing mechanism is introduced which
   entitles a client with many downstream neighbors serving him
   concurrently. While some file-share P2P system requires a long time
   to do off-line decoding after the total download of the file,
   decoding of the video-clip data must be finished before it is played
   so as to sustain the playback rate. And a suitable size of generation
   should be determined to make the decoding-task more conveniently.

   The advantage of network coding is to make every received block data
   useful, which takes the full advance of the bandwidth. It allows a
   more effective way to use the bandwidth and shows a more robust
   resilience to peer churn.

3. Validation of P2P-VoD System with VS and NC

   We do some measurement and experiment to validate our system and its
   key technology.

   In our experiment, we play a 20 minutes video-clip and the playback
   rate is set to 10 blocks (each block is 1K). We set Network coding
   operation within 40 blocks. Every peer has an average of five peers
   for both downstream and upstream. And the initial buffer time is 5
   seconds. Then, we compare the system with NC or without NC.

Internet-Draft             ppsp-vod-system            October 25, 2010


3.1. Normal performance

   In this experiment, we set the initial buffer time and set non-
   packet-drop. 200 peers sequentially join the system in an interval of
   five seconds. No peer joins or leaves the system during the process.

   In the case of using NC or not using NC, We compare the average of
   200 peer's playback error / total playback time as the playback
   performance under 1.1 times, 1.5 times, 2.0 times, 2.5 times and 3.0
   times bandwidth. And the basic bandwidth is equal to the playback
   rate.

   Playback performance

   Bandwidth:    1.1   1.5   2.0   2.5   3.0

   With NC:      47%   29%   10%   2%    0%

   Without NC:   43%   30%   19%   23%   10%

   Re-request to the tracker is introduced in the system with NC. And
   it's easily occurred in the situation of limited bandwidth. Therefore,
   our system leads to a worse result compared with non-NC system when
   the bandwidth is almost equal to the playback rate.

   When the bandwidth is raised to the 1.5 times of playback rate,
   playback performance of the system with NC is much better. This is
   because the bandwidth is almost fully used to the most emergency.

   The non-monotone phenomenon in the system without NC is because the
   peer selection algorithm is random pick. Therefore, the sequentially
   join of the peer may cause the much different performance among the
   200 peers. Thus, the result of this experiment is not monotonic.

3.2. Performance with packet-drop

   In this experiment, we introduce the packet-drop rate of 5% to make
   our results more practical. Generally, when a block is lost, the peer
   has to wait until next time slot to request the missing block. But
   with NC, a useful block is decoded by several encoded blocks.
   Therefore, one missing encoded block will not impact the performance
   in large extent.

   Playback performance with packet drop

   Bandwidth:    1.5   2.0   2.5   3.0

Internet-Draft             ppsp-vod-system            October 25, 2010


   With NC:      28%   10%   0%    0%

   Without NC:   33%   30%   12%   9%

   The result of this experiment shows that in a more practical
   situation, our system behaves much better than the system without NC.

3.3. Performance under peer churn

   In the actual environment, peers leave and join the system rapidly.
   To simulate this situation, we let over half of all the peers (around
   100 peers) join the data distributing in sequence, and then inform
   peers to leave or join using random distribution.

   Playback performance under peer churning

   Bandwidth:    1.1   1.5   2.0   2.5   3.0

   With NC:      45%   22%   10%   0%    0%

   Without NC:   41%   37%   20%   17%   21%

   Under the condition of peer churning, both systems' performance is
   declined, but system with NC is still better. The main reason is that
   in NC scheme, one block is served by several peers. Therefore, one
   peer's leaving will not affect the playback performance much.

4. PPSP Compatibility Considerations

   The objective of the PPSP work is to standardize the key signaling
   protocols among various P2P streaming system components including the
   tracker and the peers.

   Network coding can be well combined with the PPSP peer protocol. It
   uses buffermap to exchange the data availability and allows peers to
   exchange their property.

   Using video-segmentation also promotes the performance of PPSP
   protocol since it can promote the VCR playback lag when a VCR
   operation occurs.

5. Security Considerations

   This draft does not introduce any new security issues.

6. IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

7. Conclusions

   Through the use of the P2P-VoD system with video segmentation and
   network coding, user will have a better experience when watching a
   video. Otherwise, the wasted bandwidth is reduced due to more
   precision seek operation. And the bandwidth is well used due to the
   introduction of network coding.
