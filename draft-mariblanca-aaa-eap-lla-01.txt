Abstract


   This document defines a new AVP to be transported in RADIUS or
   Diameter when EAP is carried over these protocols. The purpose of
   this AVP is to determine which layer 2 protocol was used to
   encapsulate the EAP messages at the point they were initiated.

1. Introduction


   This document defines a new AVP to be transported in RADIUS or
   Diameter when EAP [EAP] is carried over these protocols. This
   information will be useful for the EAP server to determine which
   service initiated the EAP procedure. This situation will be common
   when EAP is used over a layer 2 protocol for which the EAP server is
   not one of the termination points. The access node where EAP is
   decapsulated from such layer 2 protocol will package the EAP messages
   over RADIUS [RFC3579] or Diameter [DEAPapp] and send them to the EAP
   server, which in some situations will need to have some information
   about the origin of the EAP messages. For example, the EAP server may
   wish to allow/deny access from a given lower layer for every
   subscriber. The AVP defined in this document will provide this
   information to the EAP server. The EAP server MAY use this AVP at the
   moment of the authorization decision, and once this decision is
   taken, the rest of the exchange SHOULD NOT be affected.




1.1  Abbreviations


   EAP    Extensible Authentication Protocol


2. Conventions


   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when
   they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].



3. Attributes


3.1 EAP-Lower-Layer AVP


   The EAP-Lower-Layer AVP indicates the layer 2 protocol which has been
   used to carry EAP messages. This attribute MAY be used by access
   devices acting as EAP pass-through authenticators, such as network
   access servers passing EAP from a PPP interface to a RADIUS or
   DIAMETER interface.


   This AVP MAY be included in the Diameter-EAP-Request (DER) Command.
   It MUST NOT be present in the Diameter-EAP-Answer (DEA) Command.
   In case of RADIUS, the EAP-Lower-Layer AVP MAY be included in the
   Access-Request message, and MUST NOT be included in any other RADIUS
   message.


   The format of the EAP-Lower-Layer AVP is shown below.

      |EAP-Lower-Layer| Length = 1    |    Underlying Protocol        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The values for this attribute are:


          Protocol                 Value
          PPP                      1
          802.1X                   2
          IKEv2                    3
          PANA                     4



4. IANA considerations


   New values for the EAP-Lower-Layer AVP are to be allocated by First
   Come First Served [RFC 2434], in accordance with RADIUS and Diameter
   IANA guidelines [RFC 3575] [RFC 3588].
