       Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tags for Date
                      draft-ietf-cbor-date-tag-00

Abstract

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is a data
   format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small
   code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the
   need for version negotiation.

   In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags.
   RFC 7049 defines two tags for time: CBOR tag 0 (RFC 3339 date/time
   string) and tag 1 (Posix "seconds since the epoch").  Since then,
   additional requirements have become known.  This specification
   defines a CBOR tag for an RFC 3339 date text string, for applications
   needing a textual date representation without a time.  It also
   defines a CBOR tag for days since the Posix epoch, for applicaitons
   needing a numeric date representation without a time.  It is intended
   as the reference document for the IANA registration of the CBOR tags
   defined.

1.  Introduction

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [RFC7049] provides
   for the interchange of structured data without a requirement for a
   pre-agreed schema.  RFC 7049 defines a basic set of data types, as
   well as a tagging mechanism that enables extending the set of data
   types supported via an IANA registry.

   This specification defines a CBOR tag for a text string representing
   a date but not a time.  The tagged text string is represented as
   specified by the RFC 3339 [RFC3339] "full-date" production.

   This specification also defines a CBOR tag for an integer
   representing a date but not a time.  The tagged integer is a positive
   or negative value indicating the number of days since the IEEE Std
   1003.1, 2013 Edition [POSIX.1] epoch date 1970-01-01.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  IANA Considerations

2.1.  Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tags Registrations

   This section registers the following values in the IANA "Concise
   Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tags" registry [IANA.cbor-tags].

   o  Tag: 1004 (value requested)
   o  Data Item: UTF-8 text string
   o  Semantics: RFC 3339 full-date string
   o  Reference: [[ this specification ]]

   o  Tag: 100 (ASCII 'd') (value requested)
   o  Data Item: Positive or negative integer
   o  Semantics: Number of days since the epoch date 1970-01-01
   o  Reference: [[ this specification ]]

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of RFC 7049 apply; the tags introduced
   here are not expected to raise security considerations beyond those.

   A date, of course, has significant security considerations; these
   include the exploitation of ambiguities where the date is security
   relevant or where the date is used in access control decisions.
