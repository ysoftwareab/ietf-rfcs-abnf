Abstract

   RFC 1195 [1] documents a dual routing protocol that can be used to
   route both CLNP and IPv4, that is Integrated IS-IS. [2] adds
   functionality to Integrated IS-IS so that it supports IPv6.

   RFC 1195 [1] places topological restrictions on networks that are
   routed using Integrated IS-IS, specifically, that every router in a
   level-1 area must be capable of all network layer protocols that are
   present in that area, and every routers in a level-2 area must be
   capable of all network layer protocols that are present in the whole
   IS-IS routing domain.

   The mechanism described in this document enables a single IS-IS

   routing domain to support different network layer protocol topologies
   by maintaining separate SPF trees for each network layer protocol.

   Furthermore, it no longer requires a router's protocol support
   capability to be identical for all interfaces on the router.


1  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].


2  Introduction

   RFC 1195 [1] documents a dual routing protocol that can be used to
   route both CLNP and IPv4, that is Integrated IS-IS. [2] adds
   functionality to Integrated IS-IS so that it supports IPv6.

   RFC 1195 [1] places topological restrictions on networks that are
   routed using Integrated IS-IS, specifically, that every router in a
   level-1 area must be capable of all network layer protocols that are
   present in that area, and every routers in a level-2 area must be
   capable of all network layer protocols that are present in the whole
   IS-IS routing domain.

   The extension discribed in this document takes away this restriction
   by maintaining separate SPF topologies for each network layer
   protocol.

   The major benefit of this mechanism is that IPv4-only routers,
   IPv6-only routers and IPv4/IPv6-dual routers can co-exist in a single
   IS-IS routing domain.

   Furthermore, it no longer requires a router's protocol support
   capability to be identical for all interfaces on the router.

   The changes this document discribes include the design of new TLV and
   Sub-TLV to replace the existing Protocols Supported TLV and the
   migration mechanism from the current node oriented protocol support
   routing to the new interface oriented protocol support routing.


3  Maintaining Router Adjacency

   All routers MUST announce the interface oriented protocol support
   capability in IS-IS Hello packet to build the concrete view of the

   network layer protocol topology in the IS-IS routing domain.

   The "Interface Protocols Supported TLV" is introduced into the IS-IS
   Hello packet for this purpose. It replaces the existing Protocols
   Supported TLV that is prohibited from having different protocol
   support capability for each interface as specified in RFC 1195 [1]
   section 4.4.

   The rules for adjacency formation are different for broadcast and
   point-to-point interfaces.


3.1  Maintaining Adjacencies on Point-to-Point interfaces

   On point-to-point interfaces, routers MUST NOT form an adjacency if
   the neighboring router doesn't support at least one of the same
   interface oriented protocol support capability reported by "Interface
   Protocols Supported TLV" in IS-IS Hello packet.


3.2  Maintaining Adjacencies on Broadcast interfaces

   On broadcast interfaces, routers MUST attempt to form an adjacency
   regardless of the neighbor's interface oriented protocol support
   capability reported by "Interface Protocols Supported TLV" in IS-IS
   Hello packet.

   To avoid routing loops, routers MUST NOT attempt to form an adjacency
   if the neighboring router doesn't contain "Interface Protocols
   Supported TLV" in IS-IS Hello packet.

   There is no change regarding Designated IS selection, CSNP and PSNP
   with ISO 10589 [3].


4  Advertising Protocols Supported Sub-TLV in Extended IS Reachability
   TLV

   The routing capability of network layer protocols between two
   neighboring routers MUST be encoded by "Protocols Supported Sub-TLV"
   in the Extended IS Reachability TLV [4]. This sub-TLV replaces the
   existing Protocols Supported TLV in LSP that contains only the node
   oriented routing capability of the network layer protocols.

   The rules for encoding this Sub-TLV depend on the type of interface.


4.1  Protocols Supported Sub-TLV for Point-to-Point Interface Neighbors



Noguchi, Takada             Expires July 2003                   [Page 3]

Internet Draft draft-noguchi-isis-protocol-topology-01.txt February 2003


   On point-to-point interfaces, "Protocols Supported Sub-TLV" MUST be
   encoded by ANDing the local side of interface oriented protocol
   support capability with the remote side of interface oriented
   protocol support capability, which is reported by the "Interface
   Protocols Supported TLV" in the neighboring router's IS-IS Hello
   packet.


4.2  Protocols Supported Sub-TLV for Broadcast Interface Neighbors

   On broadcast interfaces, the routing capability between two
   neighboring routers is encoded by two "Protocols Supported Sub-TLVs".
   One is in a regular LSP and the other one is in a pseudo-node LSP.

   In the regular LSP, "Protocols Supported Sub-TLV" in Extended IS
   Reachability TLV to pseudo-node IS, MUST contain interface oriented
   protocol suppport capability of originating router.

   In the pseudo-node LSP, the "Protocols Supported Sub-TLV" in the
   Extended IS Reachability TLV to each neighboring router MUST contain
   each router's interface oriented protocol support capability, which
   DIS received in the "Interface Protocols Supported TLV" in each
   neighboring router's IS-IS Hello packet.

   Then the SPF calculation acquires routing capability of network layer
   protocols between two neighboring routers by combining those two
   "Protocols Supported Sub-TLVs". Detail is specified in section 5.


5  SPF calculation

   To build separate topologies of each network layer protocol, the SPF
   caluculation MUST be done for each network layer protocol.

   "Protocols Supported Sub-TLV" in Extended IS Reachability TLV MUST be
   used to check the routing capability of each network layer protocols.
   This replaces the use of the existing Protocols Supported TLV which
   contains only the node oriented routing capability of network layer
   protocols.

   On point-to-point networks, the "Protocols Supported Sub-TLV" in the
   Extended IS Reachability TLV to the neighboring router MUST contain
   the specified network layer protocols identifier to use the
   neighboring router for the specified SPF calculation.

   On broadcast networks, both the "Protocols Supported Sub-TLV" in
   Extended IS Reachability TLV to pseudo-node IS in regular LSP and the
   "Protocols Supported Sub-TLV" in Extended IS Reachability TLV to the

Internet Draft draft-noguchi-isis-protocol-topology-01.txt February 2003


   neighboring router in pseudo-node LSP MUST contain the specified
   network layer protocols identifier to use the neighboring router for
   the specified protocol SPF calculation.

   The reverse protocol support capability check within SPF SHOULD be
   made to acquire the bi-directinal protocol support capability.


6  LSP Flooding

   There is no change in the LSP flooding mechanism with ISO 11589 [3].


7  Packet Encoding

   One TLV and one Sub-TLV are introduced for the protocol topology
   support.


7.1  Interface Protocols Supported TLV

   Interface Protocols Supported TLV MUST be encoded in all IS-IS Hello
   packets to replace the existing Protocols Supported TLV.

   This TLV contains the set of Network Layer Protocol Identifiers for
   Network Layer protocols that this interface is capable of sending and
   receiving.

7.2  Protocols Supported Sub-TLV in Extended IS Reachability TLV

   Protocols Supported Sub-TLV MUST be encoded in all Extended IS Reach-
   ability TLV as specified section 4 to replace the existing Protocols
   Supported TLV.

   This TLV contains the set of Network Layer Protocol Identifiers for
   Network Layer protocols that two neighboring routers are capable of.

8  Migration from Node Oriented to Interface Oriented Protocol Support

   Protocols Supported TLV (TLV 129) in IS-IS Hello packets and LSPs
   with LSP number 0 identifies the protocols which are supported by
   each router as defined in RFC 1195 [1]. This TLV MUST be identical
   for all IS-IS Hello packets and all LSPs with LSP number 0 as stated
   in RFC 1195 [1] section 4.4. This is called the node oriented proto-
   col support routing.

   The Interface Protocols Supported TLV (TLV 139) and the Protocols
   Supported Sub-TLV (Sub-TLV 129) in the Extended IS-Reachability TLV
   (TLV 22) are defined in this draft. The Interface Protocols Supported
   TLV identifies the protocols capability which are supported by the
   interface on which IS-IS Hello packet is transmitted. The Protocols
   Supported Sub-TLV in the Extended IS-Reachability TLV is flooded
   those interface oriented protocol support capability in the IS-IS
   routing domain. This is called the interface oriented protocol sup-
   port routing.

   If not all routers in the IS-IS routing domain support the interface
   oriented protocol support routing, the node oriented protocol support
   routing MUST continue to be used. Once all routers in the network are
   able to support the new TLV and Sub-TLV containing interface oriented
   protocol support capability, then network can be migrated to the new
   interface oriented protocol support routing, though care must be
   taken to avoid routing loops.


8.1  Transition Algorithm

   To facilitate a smooth transition between the use of the node ori-
   ented protocol support routing exclusively to the use of the inter-
   face oriented protocol support routing exclusively, the following
   steps must be taken, in the order below.

     (1)  All routers advertise the Protocols Supported TLV in IS-IS
          Hello packets and LSPs with LSP number 0 as defined in RFC
          1195 [1], and consider only the Protocols Supported TLV in
          LSPs in their SPF calculation.

     (2)  Each router is configured in turn to send the Interface
          Protocols Suppported TLV as well as the Protocols Supported
          TLV in IS-IS Hello packet and the Protocols Supported Sub-TLV
          in the Extended IS-Reachability TLV as well as the Protocols
          Supported TLV in the LSPs. The all protocol support capability
          identifiers SHOULD be same.

     (3)  When all routers are advertising the Interface Protocols
          Supported TLV in IS-IS Hello packets and the Protocols
          Supported Sub-TLV in Extended IS-Reachability TLV, make any
          changes necessary on each system to consider Interface
          Protocols Supported TLV in IS-IS Hello packet for the
          adjacency formation and the Protocols Supported Sub-TLV in
          Extended IS-Reachability TLV for the SPF calculation.

     (4)  Each router is configured in turn to stop advertising the
          Protocols Supported TLV in IS-IS Hello packet and LSPs with
          LSP number 0.

     (5)  When the area is only using interface oriented protocol
          support routing, the protocol support capability on individual
          interface may be reconfigured to take advantage of the
          interface oriented protocol support routing.
