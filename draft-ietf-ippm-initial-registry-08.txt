1.  Introduction

   Note: Efforts to synchronize structure and terminology with
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] will likely be incomplete until both
   drafts are stable.

   This memo proposes an initial set of entries for the Performance
   Metric Registry.  It uses terms and definitions from the IPPM
   literature, primarily [RFC2330].



Morton, et al.           Expires April 25, 2019                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              Initial Registry                October 2018


   Although there are several standard templates for organizing
   specifications of performance metrics (see [RFC2679] for an example
   of the traditional IPPM template, based to large extent on the
   Benchmarking Methodology Working Group's traditional template in
   [RFC1242], and see [RFC6390] for a similar template), none of these
   templates were intended to become the basis for the columns of an
   IETF-wide registry of metrics.  While examining aspects of metric
   specifications which need to be registered, it became clear that none
   of the existing metric templates fully satisfies the particular needs
   of a registry.

   Therefore, [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] defines the overall format
   for a Performance Metric Registry.  Section 5 of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] also gives guidelines for those
   requesting registration of a Metric, that is the creation of entry(s)
   in the Performance Metric Registry: "In essence, there needs to be
   evidence that a candidate Registered Performance Metric has
   significant industry interest, or has seen deployment, and there is
   agreement that the candidate Registered Performance Metric serves its
   intended purpose."  The process in [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry]
   also requires that new entries are administered by IANA through
   Expert Review, which will ensure that the metrics are tightly
   defined.

2.  Scope

   This document defines the initial set of Performance Metrics Registry
   entries, for which IETF approval (following development in the IP
   Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group) will satisfy the
   requirement for Expert Review.  Most are Active Performance Metrics,
   which are based on RFCs prepared in the IPPM working group of the
   IETF, according to their framework [RFC2330] and its updates.

3.  Registry Categories and Columns

   This section provides the categories and columns of the registry, for
   easy reference.  An entry (row) therefore gives a complete
   description of a Registered Metric.

4.  UDP Round-trip Latency and Loss Registry Entries

   This section specifies an initial registry entry for the UDP Round-
   trip Latency, and another entry for UDP Round-trip Loss Ratio.

   Note: Each Registry entry only produces a "raw" output or a
   statistical summary.  To describe both "raw" and one or more
   statistics efficiently, the Identifier, Name, and Output Categories
   can be split and a single section can specify two or more closely-
   related metrics.  This section specifies two Registry entries with
   many common columns.  See Section 7 for an example specifying
   multiple Registry entries with many common columns.

   All column entries beside the ID, Name, Description, and Output
   Reference Method categories are the same, thus this section proposes
   two closely-related registry entries.  As a result, IANA is also
   asked to assign corresponding URNs and URLs to each Named Metric.

4.1.  Summary

   This category includes multiple indexes to the registry entry: the
   element ID and metric name.

4.1.1.  ID (Identifier)

   <insert a numeric identifier, an integer, TBD>

   IANA is asked to assign different numeric identifiers to each of the
   two Named Metrics.

4.1.2.  Name

   <insert name according to metric naming convention>

   RTDelay_Active_IP-UDP-Periodic_RFCXXXXsecY_Seconds_95Percentile

   RTLoss_Active_IP-UDP-Periodic_RFCXXXXsecY_Percent_LossRatio

4.1.3.  URIs

   URN: Prefix urn:ietf:metrics:perf:<name>

   URL: http://<TBD by IANA>/<name>

4.1.4.  Description

   RTDelay: This metric assesses the delay of a stream of packets
   exchanged between two hosts (which are the two measurement points),
   and the Output is the Round-trip delay for all successfully exchanged
   packets expressed as the 95th percentile of their conditional delay
   distribution.

   RTLoss: This metric assesses the loss ratio of a stream of packets
   exchanged between two hosts (which are the two measurement points),
   and the Output is the Round-trip loss ratio for all successfully
   exchanged packets expressed as a percentage.

4.2.  Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary
   details related to the metric definition, including the RFC reference
   and values of input factors, called fixed parameters.

4.2.1.  Reference Definition

   <Full bibliographic reference to an immutable doc.>

   Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M.  Zekauskas, "A Round-trip Delay
   Metric for IPPM", RFC 2681, September 1999.

   [RFC2681]

   <specific section reference and additional clarifications, if needed>

   Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] provides the reference definition of the
   singleton (single value) Round-trip delay metric.  Section 3.4 of
   [RFC2681] provides the reference definition expanded to cover a
   multi-singleton sample.  Note that terms such as singleton and sample
   are defined in Section 11 of [RFC2330].

   Note that although the [RFC2681] definition of "Round-trip-Delay
   between Src and Dst" is directionally ambiguous in the text, this
   metric tightens the definition further to recognize that the host in
   the "Src" role will send the first packet to "Dst", and ultimately
   receive the corresponding return packet from "Dst" (when neither are
   lost).

   Finally, note that the variable "dT" is used in [RFC2681] to refer to
   the value of Round-trip delay in metric definitions and methods.  The
   variable "dT" has been re-used in other IPPM literature to refer to
   different quantities, and cannot be used as a global variable name.

   Morton, A., "Round-trip Packet Loss Metrics", RFC 6673, August 2012.

   [RFC6673]

   Both delay and loss metrics employ a maximum waiting time for
   received packets, so the count of lost packets to total packets sent
   is the basis for the loss ratio calculation as per Section 6.1 of
   [RFC6673].

4.2.2.  Fixed Parameters

   <list and specify Fixed Parameters, input factors that must be
   determined and embedded in the measurement system for use when
   needed>

   Type-P as defined in Section 13 of [RFC2330]:

   o  IPv4 header values:

      *  DSCP: set to 0

      *  TTL: set to 255

      *  Protocol: Set to 17 (UDP)

   o  IPv6 header values:

      *  DSCP: set to 0

      *  Hop Count: set to 255

      *  Protocol: Set to 17 (UDP)

   o  UDP header values:

      *  Checksum: the checksum MUST be calculated and included in the
         header

   o  UDP Payload

      *  total of 100 bytes

   Other measurement parameters:

   o  Tmax: a loss threshold waiting time

      *  3.0, expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of type
         decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see section 9.3 of
         [RFC6020]) and with resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), with
         lossless conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per
         section 6 of [RFC5905].

4.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

4.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   The methodology for this metric is defined as Type-P-Round-trip-
   Delay-Poisson-Stream in section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] and section
   3.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] using the Type-P and Tmax defined under
   Fixed Parameters.  However, the Periodic stream will be generated
   according to [RFC3432].

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and
   lost packets by implementing a maximum waiting time for packet
   arrival.  Tmax is the waiting time used as the threshold to declare a
   packet lost.  Lost packets SHALL be designated as having undefined
   delay, and counted for the RTLoss metric.

   The calculations on the delay (RTT) SHALL be performed on the
   conditional distribution, conditioned on successful packet arrival
   within Tmax.  Also, when all packet delays are stored, the process
   which calculates the RTT value MAY enforce the Tmax threshold on
   stored values before calculations.  See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for
   details on the conditional distribution to exclude undefined values
   of delay, and Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background on this analysis
   choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between
   different packets in a stream to establish correspondence between
   sending times and receiving times for each successfully-arriving
   packet.  Sequence numbers or other send-order identification MUST be
   retained at the Src or included with each packet to disambiguate
   packet reordering if it occurs.

   If a standard measurement protocol is employed, then the measurement
   process will determine the sequence numbers or timestamps applied to
   test packets after the Fixed and Runtime parameters are passed to
   that process.  The chosen measurement protocol will dictate the
   format of sequence numbers and time-stamps, if they are conveyed in
   the packet payload.

   Refer to Section 4.4 of [RFC6673] for expanded discussion of the
   instruction to "send a Type-P packet back to the Src as quickly as
   possible" in Section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681].  Section 8 of
   [RFC6673] presents additional requirements which MUST be included in
   the method of measurement for this metric.

   This section gives the details of the packet traffic which is the
   basis for measurement.  In IPPM metrics, this is called the Stream,
   and can easily be described by providing the list of stream
   parameters.

   Section 3 of [RFC3432] prescribes the method for generating Periodic
   streams using associated parameters.

   incT  the nominal duration of inter-packet interval, first bit to
      first bit, with value 0.0200, expressed in units of seconds, as a
      positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see
      section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) and with resolution of 0.0001 seconds
      (0.1 ms).

   dT the duration of the interval for allowed sample start times, with
      value 1.0, expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of
      type decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see section 9.3 of
      [RFC6020]) and with resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms).

   T0 the actual start time of the periodic stream, (format "date-and-
      time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3
      of [RFC6991]).

   NOTE: an initiation process with a number of control exchanges
   resulting in unpredictable start times (within a time interval) may
   be sufficient to avoid synchronization of periodic streams, and
   therefore a valid replacement for selecting a start time at random
   from a fixed interval.

   The T0 parameter will be reported as a measured parameter.
   Parameters incT and dT are Fixed Parameters.

4.3.3.  Traffic Filtering (observation) Details

   observed, and this section provides the filter details (when

4.3.5.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.

   <list of run-time parameters, and their data formats>

   Src  the IP address of the host in the Src Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see Section 4 of [RFC6991])

   Dst  the IP address of the host in the Dst Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see section 4 of [RFC6991])

   T0 a time, the start of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-
      time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3
      of [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a start time is unspecified
      and Tf is to be interpreted as the Duration of the measurement
      interval.  The start time is controlled through other means.

   Tf a time, the end of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time"
      as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a end time date is ignored and
      Tf is interpreted as the Duration of the measurement interval.

4.3.6.  Roles

   <lists the names of the different roles from the measurement method>

   Src  launches each packet and waits for return transmissions from
      Dst.

   Dst  waits for each packet from Src and sends a return packet to Src.

4.4.  Output

   This category specifies all details of the Output of measurements
   using the metric.

4.4.1.  Type

   <insert name of the output type, raw or a selected summary statistic>

   Percentile -- for the conditional distribution of all packets with a
   valid value of Round-trip delay (undefined delays are excluded), a
   single value corresponding to the 95th percentile, as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   The percentile = 95, meaning that the reported delay, "95Percentile",
   is the smallest value of Round-trip delay for which the Empirical
   Distribution Function (EDF), F(95Percentile) >= 95% of the singleton
   Round-trip delay values in the conditional distribution.  See section
   11.3 of [RFC2330] for the definition of the percentile statistic
   using the EDF.

   LossRatio -- the count of lost packets to total packets sent is the
   basis for the loss ratio calculation as per Section 6.1 of [RFC6673].

4.4.2.  Reference Definition

   <describe the reference data format for each type of result>

   For all outputs ---

   T0 the start of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time" as
      specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].

   Tf the end of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time" as
      specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of

      type decimal64 with fraction digits = 9 (see section 9.3 of
      [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.0000000001.

4.4.3.  Metric Units

   <insert units for the measured results, and the reference
   specification>.

   The 95th Percentile of Round-trip Delay is expressed in seconds.

   The Round-trip Loss Ratio is expressed as a percentage of lost
   packets to total packets sent.

4.4.4.  Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the
   systematic and random errors of a time measurement.  In-situ
   calibration could be enabled with an internal loopback at the Source
   host that includes as much of the measurement system as possible,
   performs address manipulation as needed, and provides some form of
   isolation (e.g., deterministic delay) to avoid send-receive interface
   contention.  Some portion of the random and systematic error can be
   characterized this way.

   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the
   loopback is applied and the result is output in the same format as a
   normal measurement with additional indication that it is a
   calibration result.

   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be
   used to estimate the *available accuracy* of the Output Metric Units.
   For example, repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal the
   portion of the Output result resolution which is the result of system
   noise, and thus inaccurate.

   Parameters.

5.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

5.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   See section 2.6 and 3.6 of [RFC3393] for general singleton element
   calculations.  This metric entry requires implementation of the PDV
   form defined in section 4.2 of [RFC5481].  Also see measurement
   considerations in section 8 of [RFC5481].

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and
   lost packets by implementing a maximum waiting time for packet
   arrival.  Tmax is the waiting time used as the threshold to declare a
   packet lost.  Lost packets SHALL be designated as having undefined
   delay.

   The calculations on the one-way delay SHALL be performed on the
   conditional distribution, conditioned on successful packet arrival
   within Tmax.  Also, when all packet delays are stored, the process
   which calculates the one-way delay value MAY enforce the Tmax
   threshold on stored values before calculations.  See section 4.1 of
   [RFC3393] for details on the conditional distribution to exclude
   undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background
   on this analysis choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between
   different packets in a stream to establish correspondence between
   sending times and receiving times for each successfully-arriving
   packet.  Sequence numbers or other send-order identification MUST be
   retained at the Src or included with each packet to disambiguate
   packet reordering if it occurs.

   If a standard measurement protocol is employed, then the measurement
   process will determine the sequence numbers or timestamps applied to
   test packets after the Fixed and Runtime parameters are passed to
   that process.  The chosen measurement protocol will dictate the
   format of sequence numbers and time-stamps, if they are conveyed in
   the packet payload.

5.3.2.  Packet Stream Generation

   <list of generation parameters and section/spec references if needed>

   This section gives the details of the packet traffic which is the
   basis for measurement.  In IPPM metrics, this is called the Stream,
   and can easily be described by providing the list of stream
   parameters.

   Section 3 of [RFC3432] prescribes the method for generating Periodic
   streams using associated parameters.

   incT  the nominal duration of inter-packet interval, first bit to
      first bit, with value 0.0200, expressed in units of seconds, as a
      positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see
      section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) and with resolution of 0.0001 seconds
      (0.1 ms).

   dT the duration of the interval for allowed sample start times, with
      value 1.0, expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of
      type decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see section 9.3 of
      [RFC6020]) and with resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms).

   T0 the actual start time of the periodic stream, (format "date-and-
      time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3
      of [RFC6991]).

   NOTE: an initiation process with a number of control exchanges
   resulting in unpredictable start times (within a time interval) may
   be sufficient to avoid synchronization of periodic streams, and
   therefore a valid replacement for selecting a start time at random
   from a fixed interval.

   The T0 parameter will be reported as a measured parameter.
   Parameters incT and dT are Fixed Parameters.

      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see section 4 of [RFC6991])

   T0 a time, the start of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-
      time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3
      of [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a start time is unspecified
      and Tf is to be interpreted as the Duration of the measurement
      interval.  The start time is controlled through other means.

   Tf a time, the end of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time"
      as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   The percentile = 95, meaning that the reported delay, "95Percentile",
   is the smallest value of one-way PDV for which the Empirical
   Distribution Function (EDF), F(95Percentile) >= 95% of the singleton
   one-way PDV values in the conditional distribution.  See section 11.3
   of [RFC2330] for the definition of the percentile statistic using the
   EDF.

5.4.2.  Reference Definition

   <the output type and data format for each type of result>

   T0 the start of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time" as
      specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of

      [RFC2330].

   95Percentile  The time value of the result is expressed in units of
      seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction
      digits = 9 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of
      0.000000001 seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from
      the 64-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905]

5.4.4.  Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the
   systematic and random errors of a time measurement.  In-situ
   calibration could be enabled with an internal loopback that includes
   as much of the measurement system as possible, performs address
   manipulation as needed, and provides some form of isolation (e.g.,
   deterministic delay) to avoid send-receive interface contention.
   Some portion of the random and systematic error can be characterized
   this way.

   For one-way delay measurements, the error calibration must include an
   assessment of the internal clock synchronization with its external
   reference (this internal clock is supplying timestamps for
   measurement).  In practice, the time offsets of clocks at both the
   source and destination are needed to estimate the systematic error
   due to imperfect clock synchronization (the time offsets are
   smoothed, thus the random variation is not usually represented in the
   results).

   time_offset  The time value of the result is expressed in units of
      seconds, as a signed value of type decimal64 with fraction digits
      = 9 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.000000001
      seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit
      NTP timestamp as per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905]

   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the
   loopback is applied and the result is output in the same format as a
   normal measurement with additional indication that it is a
   calibration result.  In any measurement, the measurement function
   SHOULD report its current estimate of time offset as an indicator of
   the degree of synchronization.

   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be
   used to estimate the *available accuracy* of the Output Metric Units.
   For example, repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal the
   portion of the Output result resolution which is the result of system
   noise, and thus inaccurate.

   Lost packets represent a challenge for delay variation metrics.  See

   statement[RFC5481] for extensive analysis and comparison of PDV and
   an alternate metric, IPDV.

6.  DNS Response Latency and Loss Registry Entries

   @@@@ comment from Brian: there is an interesting method for DNS
   measurement by encoding information in the query itself.  It is a
   question of what exactly we are trying to measure: specific RR, or
   the infrastructure itself. (at this time we measure a specific RR).

   This section gives initial registry entries for DNS Response Latency
   and Loss from a network user's perspective, for a specific named
   resource.  The metric can be measured repeatedly using different
   names.  RFC 2681 [RFC2681] defines a Round-trip delay metric.  We
   build on that metric by specifying several of the input parameters to
   precisely define two metrics for measuring DNS latency and loss.

   Note to IANA: Each Registry "Name" below specifies a single registry
   entry, whose output format varies in accordance with the name.

   All column entries beside the ID, Name, Description, and Output
   Reference Method categories are the same, thus this section proposes
   two closely-related registry entries.  As a result, IANA is also
   asked to assign corresponding URNs and URLs to each Named Metric.

6.1.4.  Description

   This is a metric for DNS Response performance from a network user's
   perspective, for a specific named resource.  The metric can be
   measured repeatedly using different resource names.

   RTDNS: This metric assesses the response time, the interval from the
   query transmission to the response.

   RLDNS: This metric indicates that the response was deemed lost.  In
   other words, the response time exceeded the maximum waiting time.

6.2.1.  Reference Definition

   <Full bibliographic reference to an immutable doc.>

   Mockapetris, P., "Domain names - implementation and specification",
   STD 13, RFC 1035, November 1987. (and updates)

   [RFC1035]

   Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M.  Zekauskas, "A Round-trip Delay
   Metric for IPPM", RFC 2681, September 1999.

   [RFC2681]

   <specific section reference and additional clarifications, if needed>

   Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] provides the reference definition of the
   singleton (single value) Round-trip delay metric.  Section 3.4 of
   [RFC2681] provides the reference definition expanded to cover a
   multi-singleton sample.  Note that terms such as singleton and sample
   are defined in Section 11 of [RFC2330].

   For DNS Response Latency, the entities in [RFC1035] must be mapped to
   [RFC2681].  The Local Host with its User Program and Resolver take
   the role of "Src", and the Foreign Name Server takes the role of
   "Dst".

   Note that although the [RFC2681] definition of "Round-trip-Delay
   between Src and Dst at T" is directionally ambiguous in the text,
   this metric tightens the definition further to recognize that the
   host in the "Src" role will send the first packet to "Dst", and
   ultimately receive the corresponding return packet from "Dst" (when
   neither are lost).

   Morton, A., "Round-trip Packet Loss Metrics", RFC 6673, August 2012.

   [RFC6673]

   Both response time and loss metrics employ a maximum waiting time for
   received responses, so the count of lost packets to total packets
   sent is the basis for the loss determination as per Section 4.3 of
   [RFC6673].

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

6.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   The methodology for this metric is defined as Type-P-Round-trip-
   Delay-Poisson-Stream in section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] and section




Morton, et al.           Expires April 25, 2019                [Page 30]

   3.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] using the Type-P and Timeout defined under
   Fixed Parameters.

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and
   lost packets by implementing a maximum waiting time for packet
   arrival.  Tmax is the waiting time used as the threshold to declare a
   response packet lost.  Lost packets SHALL be designated as having
   undefined delay and counted for the RLDNS metric.

   The calculations on the delay (RTT) SHALL be performed on the
   conditional distribution, conditioned on successful packet arrival
   within Tmax.  Also, when all packet delays are stored, the process
   which calculates the RTT value MAY enforce the Tmax threshold on
   stored values before calculations.  See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for
   details on the conditional distribution to exclude undefined values
   of delay, and Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background on this analysis
   choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between
   different packets in a stream to establish correspondence between
   sending times and receiving times for each successfully-arriving
   reply.

   DNS Messages bearing Queries provide for random ID Numbers in the
   Identification header field, so more than one query may be launched
   while a previous request is outstanding when the ID Number is used.
   Therefore, the ID Number MUST be retained at the Src or included with
   each response packet to disambiguate packet reordering if it occurs.

   IF a DNS response does not arrive within Tmax, the response time
   RTDNS is undefined, and RLDNS = 1.  The Message ID SHALL be used to
   disambiguate the successive queries that are otherwise identical.

   Since the ID Number filed is only 16 bits in length, it places a
   limit on the number of simultaneous outstanding DNS queries during a
   stress test from a single Src address.

   Refer to Section 4.4 of [RFC6673] for expanded discussion of the
   instruction to "send a Type-P packet back to the Src as quickly as
   possible" in Section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681].  However, the DNS
   Server is expected to perform all required functions to prepare and
   send a response, so the response time will include processing time
   and network delay.  Section 8 of [RFC6673] presents additional
   requirements which SHALL be included in the method of measurement for
   this metric.

   In addition to operations described in [RFC2681], the Src MUST parse
   the DNS headers of the reply and prepare the information for

   subsequent reporting as a measured result, along with the Round-Trip
   Delay.

6.3.2.  Packet Stream Generation

   This section gives the details of the packet traffic which is the
   basis for measurement.  In IPPM metrics, this is called the Stream,
   and can easily be described by providing the list of stream
   parameters.

   <list of generation parameters and section/spec references if needed>

   Section 11.1.3 of RFC 2681 [RFC2330] provides three methods to
   generate Poisson sampling intervals.  The reciprocal of lambda is the
   average packet rate, thus the Run-time Parameter is Reciprocal_lambda
   = 1/lambda, in seconds.

   Method 3 is used, where given a start time (Run-time Parameter), the
   subsequent send times are all computed prior to measurement by
   computing the pseudo-random distribution of inter-packet send times,
   (truncating the distribution as specified in the Run-time
   Parameters), and the Src sends each packet at the computed times.

   Note that Trunc is the upper limit on inter-packet times in the
   Poisson distribution.  A random value greater than Trunc is set equal
   to Trunc instead.

6.3.3.  Traffic Filtering (observation) Details

   The measured results based on a filtered version of the packets
   observed, and this section provides the filter details (when
   present).

6.3.5.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.

   <list of run-time parameters, and their data formats>

   Src  the IP address of the host in the Src Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see Section 4 of [RFC6991])

   Dst  the IP address of the host in the Dst Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see section 4 of [RFC6991])

   T0 a time, the start of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-
      time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3
      of [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a start time is unspecified
      and Tf is to be interpreted as the Duration of the measurement
      interval.  The start time is controlled through other means.

   Tf a time, the end of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time"
      as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a end time date is ignored and
      Tf is interpreted as the Duration of the measurement interval.

   Reciprocal_lambda  average packet interval for Poisson Streams
      expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of type
      decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020])
      with resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), and with lossless
      conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of
      [RFC5905].

   Trunc  Upper limit on Poisson distribution expressed in units of
      seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction
      digits = 4 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of
      0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), and with lossless conversion to/from the
      32-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of [RFC5905] (values above
      this limit will be clipped and set to the limit value). (if fixed,
      Trunc = 30.0000 seconds.)

   ID The 16-bit identifier assigned by the program that generates the
      query, and which must vary in successive queries, see
      Section 4.1.1 of [RFC1035].  This identifier is copied into the

      corresponding reply and can be used by the requester (Src) to
      match-up replies to outstanding queries.

   QNAME  The domain name of the Query, formatted as specified in
      section 4 of [RFC6991].

   QTYPE  The Query Type, which will correspond to the IP address family
      of the query (decimal 1 for IPv4 or 28 for IPv6, formatted as a
      uint16, as per section 9.2 of [RFC6020].

6.3.6.  Roles

   <lists the names of the different roles from the measurement method>

   Src  launches each packet and waits for return transmissions from
      Dst.

   Dst  waits for each packet from Src and sends a return packet to Src.

6.4.  Output

   This category specifies all details of the Output of measurements
   using the metric.

6.4.1.  Type

   <insert name of the output type, raw or a selected summary statistic>

   Raw -- for each DNS Query packet sent, sets of values as defined in
   the next column, including the status of the response, only assigning
   delay values to successful query-response pairs.

6.4.2.  Reference Definition

   <describe the data format for each type of result>

   For all outputs:

   T  the time the DNS Query was sent during the measurement interval,
      (format "date-and-time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339],
      see also Section 3 of [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required
      by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330].

   dT The time value of the round-trip delay to receive the DNS
      response, expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of
      type decimal64 with fraction digits = 9 (see section 9.3 of
      [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.000000001 seconds (1.0 ns), and
      with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit NTP timestamp as per

      section 6 of RFC [RFC5905].  This value is undefined when the
      response packet is not received at Src within waiting time Tmax
      seconds.

   Rcode  The value of the Rcode field in the DNS response header,
      expressed as a uint64 as specified in section 9.2 of [RFC6020].
      Non-zero values convey errors in the response, and such replies
      must be analyzed separately from successful requests.

6.4.3.  Metric Units

   <insert units for the measured results, and the reference
   specification>.

   RTDNS: Round-trip Delay, dT, is expressed in seconds.

   RTLDNS: the Logical value, where 1 = Lost and 0 = Received.

6.4.4.  Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the
   systematic and random errors of a time measurement.  In-situ
   calibration could be enabled with an internal loopback at the Source
   host that includes as much of the measurement system as possible,
   performs address and payload manipulation as needed, and provides
   some form of isolation (e.g., deterministic delay) to avoid send-
   receive interface contention.  Some portion of the random and
   systematic error can be characterized this way.

   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the
   loopback is applied and the result is output in the same format as a
   normal measurement with additional indication that it is a
   calibration result.

   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be
   used to estimate the *available accuracy* of the Output Metric Units.
   For example, repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal the
   portion of the Output result resolution which is the result of system
   noise, and thus inaccurate.

      to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of [RFC5905].

   See the Packet Stream generation category for two additional Fixed
   Parameters.

7.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

7.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   The methodology for this metric is defined as Type-P-One-way-Delay-
   Poisson-Stream in section 3.6 of [RFC7679] and section 4.6 of
   [RFC7679] using the Type-P and Tmax defined under Fixed Parameters.

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and
   lost packets by implementing a maximum waiting time for packet
   arrival.  Tmax is the waiting time used as the threshold to declare a
   packet lost.  Lost packets SHALL be designated as having undefined
   delay, and counted for the OWLoss metric.

   The calculations on the one-way delay SHALL be performed on the
   conditional distribution, conditioned on successful packet arrival
   within Tmax.  Also, when all packet delays are stored, the process
   which calculates the one-way delay value MAY enforce the Tmax
   threshold on stored values before calculations.  See section 4.1 of
   [RFC3393] for details on the conditional distribution to exclude
   undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background
   on this analysis choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between
   different packets in a stream to establish correspondence between
   sending times and receiving times for each successfully-arriving
   packet.  Sequence numbers or other send-order identification MUST be
   retained at the Src or included with each packet to disambiguate
   packet reordering if it occurs.

   Since a standard measurement protocol is employed [RFC5357], then the
   measurement process will determine the sequence numbers or timestamps
   applied to test packets after the Fixed and Runtime parameters are
   passed to that process.  The measurement protocol dictates the format

   of sequence numbers and time-stamps conveyed in the TWAMP-Test packet
   payload.

7.3.2.  Packet Stream Generation

   This section gives the details of the packet traffic which is the
   basis for measurement.  In IPPM metrics, this is called the Stream,
   and can easily be described by providing the list of stream
   parameters.

   <list of generation parameters and section/spec references if needed>

   Section 11.1.3 of RFC 2681 [RFC2330] provides three methods to
   generate Poisson sampling intervals.  The reciprocal of lambda is the
   average packet spacing, thus the Run-time Parameter is
   Reciprocal_lambda = 1/lambda, in seconds.

   Method 3 SHALL be used, where given a start time (Run-time
   Parameter), the subsequent send times are all computed prior to
   measurement by computing the pseudo-random distribution of inter-
   packet send times, (truncating the distribution as specified in the
   Parameter Trunc), and the Src sends each packet at the computed
   times.

   Note that Trunc is the upper limit on inter-packet times in the
   Poisson distribution.  A random value greater than Trunc is set equal
   to Trunc instead.

   Reciprocal_lambda  average packet interval for Poisson Streams
      expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of type
      decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020])
      with resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), and with lossless
      conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of
      [RFC5905].  Reciprocal_lambda = 1 packet per second.

   Trunc  Upper limit on Poisson distribution expressed in units of
      seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction
      digits = 4 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of
      0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), and with lossless conversion to/from the
      32-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of [RFC5905] (values above
      this limit will be clipped and set to the limit value).  Trunc =
      30.0000 seconds.

7.3.5.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.

   <list of run-time parameters, and their data formats>

   Src  the IP address of the host in the Src Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see Section 4 of [RFC6991])

   Dst  the IP address of the host in the Dst Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see section 4 of [RFC6991])

   T0 a time, the start of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-
      time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3
      of [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a start time is unspecified
      and Tf is to be interpreted as the Duration of the measurement
      interval.  The start time is controlled through other means.

   Tf a time, the end of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time"
      as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a end time date is ignored and
      Tf is interpreted as the Duration of the measurement interval.

7.3.6.  Roles

   <lists the names of the different roles from the measurement method>

   Src  launches each packet and waits for return transmissions from
      Dst. This is the TWAMP Session-Sender.

   Dst  waits for each packet from Src and sends a return packet to Src.
      This is the TWAMP Session-Reflector.

      [RFC2330].

   For LossRatio -- the count of lost packets to total packets sent is
   the basis for the loss ratio calculation as per Section 4.1 of
   [RFC7680].

   For each <statistic>, one of the following sub-sections apply:

7.4.2.1.  Percentile95

   The 95th percentile SHALL be calculated using the conditional
   distribution of all packets with a finite value of One-way delay
   (undefined delays are excluded), a single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   See section 4.3 of [RFC3393] for details on the percentile statistic
   (where Round-trip delay should be substituted for "ipdv").

   The percentile = 95, meaning that the reported delay, "95Percentile",
   is the smallest value of one-way delay for which the Empirical
   Distribution Function (EDF), F(95Percentile) >= 95% of the singleton
   one-way delay values in the conditional distribution.  See section
   11.3 of [RFC2330] for the definition of the percentile statistic
   using the EDF.

7.4.2.4.  Max

   The maximum SHALL be calculated using the conditional distribution of
   all packets with a finite value of One-way delay (undefined delays

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional

                  such that for some index, j, where 1 <= j <= N

7.4.3.  Metric Units

   <insert units for the measured results, and the reference
   specification>.

   The <statistic> of One-way Delay is expressed in seconds.

   The One-way Loss Ratio is expressed as a percentage of lost packets
   to total packets sent.

7.4.4.  Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the
   systematic and random errors of a time measurement.  In-situ
   calibration could be enabled with an internal loopback that includes
   as much of the measurement system as possible, performs address
   manipulation as needed, and provides some form of isolation (e.g.,
   deterministic delay) to avoid send-receive interface contention.
   Some portion of the random and systematic error can be characterized
   this way.

   For one-way delay measurements, the error calibration must include an
   assessment of the internal clock synchronization with its external
   reference (this internal clock is supplying timestamps for
   measurement).  In practice, the time offsets of clocks at both the
   source and destination are needed to estimate the systematic error
   due to imperfect clock synchronization (the time offsets are
   smoothed, thus the random variation is not usually represented in the
   results).

   time_offset  The time value of the result is expressed in units of
      seconds, as a signed value of type decimal64 with fraction digits
      = 9 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.000000001
      seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit
      NTP timestamp as per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905]

   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the
   loopback is applied and the result is output in the same format as a
   normal measurement with additional indication that it is a
   calibration result.  In any measurement, the measurement function
   SHOULD report its current estimate of time offset as an indicator of
   the degree of synchronization.

   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be
   used to estimate the *available accuracy* of the Output Metric Units.
   For example, repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal the
   portion of the Output result resolution which is the result of system
   noise, and thus inaccurate.

   Parameters.

8.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

8.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   The methodology for this metric is defined as Type-P-One-way-Delay-
   Poisson-Stream in section 3.6 of [RFC7679] and section 4.6 of
   [RFC7679] using the Type-P and Tmax defined under Fixed Parameters.
   However, a Periodic stream is used, as defined in [RFC3432].

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and
   lost packets by implementing a maximum waiting time for packet
   arrival.  Tmax is the waiting time used as the threshold to declare a
   packet lost.  Lost packets SHALL be designated as having undefined
   delay, and counted for the OWLoss metric.

   The calculations on the one-way delay SHALL be performed on the
   conditional distribution, conditioned on successful packet arrival
   within Tmax.  Also, when all packet delays are stored, the process
   which calculates the one-way delay value MAY enforce the Tmax
   threshold on stored values before calculations.  See section 4.1 of
   [RFC3393] for details on the conditional distribution to exclude
   undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background
   on this analysis choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between
   different packets in a stream to establish correspondence between
   sending times and receiving times for each successfully-arriving
   packet.  Sequence numbers or other send-order identification MUST be
   retained at the Src or included with each packet to disambiguate
   packet reordering if it occurs.

   Since a standard measurement protocol is employed [RFC5357], then the
   measurement process will determine the sequence numbers or timestamps

   payload.

8.3.2.  Packet Stream Generation

   <list of generation parameters and section/spec references if needed>

   This section gives the details of the packet traffic which is the
   basis for measurement.  In IPPM metrics, this is called the Stream,
   and can easily be described by providing the list of stream
   parameters.

   Section 3 of [RFC3432] prescribes the method for generating Periodic
   streams using associated parameters.

   incT  the nominal duration of inter-packet interval, first bit to
      first bit, with value 0.0200 expressed in units of seconds, as a
      positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see
      section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) and with resolution of 0.0001 seconds
      (0.1 ms), with lossless conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP
      timestamp as per section 6 of [RFC5905].

   dT the duration of the interval for allowed sample start times, with
      value 1.0000, expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value
      of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see section 9.3 of
      [RFC6020]) and with resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), with
      lossless conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per
      section 6 of [RFC5905].

   T0 the actual start time of the periodic stream, determined from T0
      and dT.

   NOTE: an initiation process with a number of control exchanges
   resulting in unpredictable start times (within a time interval) may
   be sufficient to avoid synchronization of periodic streams, and
   therefore a valid replacement for selecting a start time at random
   from a fixed interval.

   These stream parameters will be specified as Run-time parameters.

8.3.5.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.

   <list of run-time parameters, and their data formats>

   Src  the IP address of the host in the Src Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see Section 4 of [RFC6991])

   Dst  the IP address of the host in the Dst Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see section 4 of [RFC6991])

   T0 a time, the start of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-
      time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3
      of [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a start time is unspecified
      and Tf is to be interpreted as the Duration of the measurement
      interval.  The start time is controlled through other means.

   Tf a time, the end of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time"
      as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a end time date is ignored and
      Tf is interpreted as the Duration of the measurement interval.

8.3.6.  Roles

   <lists the names of the different roles from the measurement method>

   Src  launches each packet and waits for return transmissions from
      Dst. This is the TWAMP Session-Sender.

   Dst  waits for each packet from Src and sends a return packet to Src.
      This is the TWAMP Session-Reflector.

8.4.  Output

   This category specifies all details of the Output of measurements
   using the metric.

   For LossRatio -- the count of lost packets to total packets sent is
   the basis for the loss ratio calculation as per Section 4.1 of
   [RFC7680].

   For each <statistic>, one of the following sub-sections apply:

8.4.2.1.  Percentile95

   The 95th percentile SHALL be calculated using the conditional
   distribution of all packets with a finite value of One-way delay
   (undefined delays are excluded), a single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   See section 4.3 of [RFC3393] for details on the percentile statistic
   (where Round-trip delay should be substituted for "ipdv").

   The percentile = 95, meaning that the reported delay, "95Percentile",
   is the smallest value of one-way delay for which the Empirical
   Distribution Function (EDF), F(95Percentile) >= 95% of the singleton
   one-way delay values in the conditional distribution.  See section
   11.3 of [RFC2330] for the definition of the percentile statistic
   using the EDF.

      digits = 9 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of

8.4.2.4.  Max

   The maximum SHALL be calculated using the conditional distribution of
   all packets with a finite value of One-way delay (undefined delays
   are excluded), a single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional

   as follows:

            Max = (FiniteDelay [j])

                  such that for some index, j, where 1 <= j <= N
                  FiniteDelay[j] >= FiniteDelay[n] for all n

      (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.000000001
      seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit
      NTP timestamp as per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905]

8.4.2.5.  Std_Dev

   The Std_Dev SHALL be calculated using the conditional distribution of
   all packets with a finite value of One-way delay (undefined delays
   are excluded), a single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of

8.4.3.  Metric Units

   <insert units for the measured results, and the reference
   specification>.

   The <statistic> of One-way Delay is expressed in seconds, where
   <statistic> is one of:

   o  95Percentile

   o  Mean

   o  Min

   o  Max

   o  StdDev

   The One-way Loss Ratio is expressed as a percentage of lost packets
   to total packets sent.

8.4.4.  Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the
   systematic and random errors of a time measurement.  In-situ
   calibration could be enabled with an internal loopback that includes
   as much of the measurement system as possible, performs address
   manipulation as needed, and provides some form of isolation (e.g.,
   deterministic delay) to avoid send-receive interface contention.
   Some portion of the random and systematic error can be characterized
   this way.

   For one-way delay measurements, the error calibration must include an
   assessment of the internal clock synchronization with its external
   reference (this internal clock is supplying timestamps for
   measurement).  In practice, the time offsets of clocks at both the
   source and destination are needed to estimate the systematic error
   due to imperfect clock synchronization (the time offsets are
   smoothed, thus the random variation is not usually represented in the
   results).

   time_offset  The time value of the result is expressed in units of
      seconds, as a signed value of type decimal64 with fraction digits
      = 9 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.000000001
      seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit
      NTP timestamp as per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905]

Internet-Draft              Initial Registry                October 2018


   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the
   loopback is applied and the result is output in the same format as a
   normal measurement with additional indication that it is a
   calibration result.  In any measurement, the measurement function
   SHOULD report its current estimate of time offset as an indicator of
   the degree of synchronization.

   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be
   used to estimate the *available accuracy* of the Output Metric Units.
   For example, repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal the
   portion of the Output result resolution which is the result of system
   noise, and thus inaccurate.

   Metric for IPPM", RFC 2681, September 1999.

   [RFC2681]

   <specific section reference and additional clarifications, if needed>

   Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] provides the reference definition of the
   singleton (single value) Round-trip delay metric.  Section 3.4 of
   [RFC2681] provides the reference definition expanded to cover a
   multi-singleton sample.  Note that terms such as singleton and sample
   are defined in Section 11 of [RFC2330].

   Note that although the [RFC2681] definition of "Round-trip-Delay
   between Src and Dst" is directionally ambiguous in the text, this
   metric tightens the definition further to recognize that the host in
   the "Src" role will send the first packet to "Dst", and ultimately
   receive the corresponding return packet from "Dst" (when neither are
   lost).

   Finally, note that the variable "dT" is used in [RFC2681] to refer to
   the value of Round-trip delay in metric definitions and methods.  The
   variable "dT" has been re-used in other IPPM literature to refer to
   different quantities, and cannot be used as a global variable name.

         lossless conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per
         section 6 of [RFC5905].

9.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

9.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   The methodology for this metric is defined as Type-P-Round-trip-
   Delay-Poisson-Stream in section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] and section
   3.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] using the Type-P and Tmax defined under
   Fixed Parameters.

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and
   lost packets by implementing a maximum waiting time for packet
   arrival.  Tmax is the waiting time used as the threshold to declare a
   packet lost.  Lost packets SHALL be designated as having undefined
   delay, and counted for the RTLoss metric.

   The calculations on the delay (RTD) SHALL be performed on the
   conditional distribution, conditioned on successful packet arrival
   within Tmax.  Also, when all packet delays are stored, the process
   which calculates the RTD value MAY enforce the Tmax threshold on
   stored values before calculations.  See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for
   details on the conditional distribution to exclude undefined values
   of delay, and Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background on this analysis
   choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between
   different packets in a stream to establish correspondence between
   sending times and receiving times for each successfully-arriving
   packet.  Sequence numbers or other send-order identification MUST be
   retained at the Src or included with each packet to disambiguate
   packet reordering if it occurs.

   The measurement process will determine the sequence numbers applied
   to test packets after the Fixed and Runtime parameters are passed to
   that process.  The ICMP measurement process and protocol will dictate
   the format of sequence numbers and other identifiers.

   Refer to Section 4.4 of [RFC6673] for expanded discussion of the
   instruction to "send a Type-P packet back to the Src as quickly as
   possible" in Section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681].  Section 8 of
   [RFC6673] presents additional requirements which MUST be included in
   the method of measurement for this metric.

9.3.2.  Packet Stream Generation

   This section gives the details of the packet traffic which is the
   basis for measurement.  In IPPM metrics, this is called the Stream,
   and can easily be described by providing the list of stream
   parameters.

   The ICMP metrics use a sending discipline called "SendOnRcv" or Send
   On Receive.  This is a modification of Section 3 of [RFC3432], which
   prescribes the method for generating Periodic streams using
   associated parameters:

   incT  the nominal duration of inter-packet interval, first bit to
      first bit

   dT the duration of the interval for allowed sample start times

   T0 the actual start time of the periodic stream

   The incT and T0 stream parameters will be specified as Run-time
   parameters, dT is not used in SendOnRcv.

   A SendOnRcv sender behaves exactly like a Periodic stream generator
   while all reply packets arrive with RTD < incT, and the inter-packet
   interval will be constant.

   If a reply packet arrives with RTD >= incT, then the inter-packet
   interval for the next sending time is nominally RTD.

   If a reply packet fails to arrive within Tmax, then the inter-packet
   interval for the next sending time is nominally Tmax.

   If an immediate send on reply arrival is desired, then set incT=0.

   See section 4.3.2 of [RFC6049] for a closely related method for
   calculating this statistic, and 4.3.3 of [RFC6049].  The formula is
   as follows:

            Max = (FiniteDelay [j])

                  such that for some index, j, where 1 <= j <= N
                  FiniteDelay[j] >= FiniteDelay[n] for all n

   Max  The time value of the result is expressed in units of seconds,
      as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 9
      (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.000000001
      seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit
      NTP timestamp as per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905]

9.4.3.  Metric Units

   <insert units for the measured results, and the reference
   specification>.

   The <statistic> of Round-trip Delay is expressed in seconds, where
   <statistic> is one of:

   o  Mean

   o  Min

   o  Max

   The Round-trip Loss Ratio is expressed as a percentage of lost
   packets to total packets sent.

9.4.4.  Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the
   systematic and random errors of a time measurement.  In-situ
   calibration could be enabled with an internal loopback at the Source
   host that includes as much of the measurement system as possible,
   performs address manipulation as needed, and provides some form of
   isolation (e.g., deterministic delay) to avoid send-receive interface
   contention.  Some portion of the random and systematic error can be
   characterized this way.

   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the
   loopback is applied and the result is output in the same format as a
   normal measurement with additional indication that it is a
   calibration result.

   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be
   used to estimate the *available accuracy* of the Output Metric Units.
   For example, repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal the
   portion of the Output result resolution which is the result of system
   noise, and thus inaccurate.

10.  TCP Round-Trip Delay and Loss Registry Entries

   This section specifies three initial registry entries for the Passive
   assessment of TCP Round-Trip Delay (RTD) and another entry for TCP
   Round-trip Loss Count.

   This section specifies four Registry entries with many common
   columns.

   All column entries beside the ID, Name, Description, and Output
   Reference Method categories are the same, thus this section proposes
   four closely-related registry entries.  As a result, IANA is also
   asked to assign four corresponding URNs and URLs to each Named
   Metric.

10.1.  Summary

   This category includes multiple indexes to the registry entry: the
   element ID and metric name.

10.2.  Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary

   and values of input factors, called fixed parameters.

10.2.1.  Reference Definitions

   <Full bibliographic reference to an immutable doc.>

   Although there is no RFC that describes passive measurement of Round-
   Trip Delay, the parallel definition for Active measurement is:

   Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M.  Zekauskas, "A Round-trip Delay
   Metric for IPPM", RFC 2681, September 1999.

   [RFC2681]

   <specific section reference and additional clarifications, if needed>

   This metric definition uses the terms singleton and sample as defined
   in Section 11 of [RFC2330].  (Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] provides the
   reference definition of the singleton (single value) Round-trip delay
   metric.  Section 3.4 of [RFC2681] provides the reference definition
   expanded to cover a multi-singleton sample.)

   With the Observation Point [RFC7011] (OP) typically located between
   the hosts participating in the TCP connection, the Round-trip Delay
   metric requires two individual measurements between the OP and each
   host, such that the Spatial Composition [RFC6049]of the measurements
   yields a Round-trip Delay singleton (we are extending the composition
   of one-way subpath delays to subpath round-trip delay).

   Using the direction of TCP SYN transmission to anchor the
   nomenclature, host A sends the SYN and host B replies with SYN-ACK
   during connection establishment.  The direction of SYN transfer is
   considered the Forward direction of transmission, from A through OP
   to B (Reverse is B through OP to A).

   Traffic filters reduce the packet stream at the OP to a Qualified
   bidirectional flow packets.

   In the definitions below, Corresponding Packets are transferred in
   different directions and convey a common value in a TCP header field
   that establishes correspondence (to the extent possible).  Examples
   may be found in the TCP timestamp fields.

   For a real number, RTD_fwd, >> the Round-trip Delay in the Forward
   direction from OP to host B at time T' is RTD_fwd << REQUIRES that OP
   observed a Qualified Packet to host B at wire-time T', that host B
   received that packet and sent a Corresponding Packet back to host A,
   and OP observed the Corresponding Packet at wire-time T' + RTD_fwd.

   For a real number, RTD_rev, >> the Round-trip Delay in the Reverse
   direction from OP to host A at time T'' is RTD_rev << REQUIRES that
   OP observed a Qualified Packet to host A at wire-time T'', that host
   A received that packet and sent a Corresponding Packet back to host
   B, and that OP observed the Corresponding Packet at wire-time T'' +
   RTD_rev.

   Ideally, the packet sent from host B to host A in both definitions
   above SHOULD be the same packet (or, when measuring RTD_rev first,
   the packet from host A to host B in both definitions should be the
   same).

   The REQUIRED Composition Function for a singleton of Round-trip Delay
   at time T (where T is the earliest of T' and T'' above) is:

   RTDelay = RTD_fwd + RTD_rev

   Note that when OP is located at host A or host B, one of the terms
   composing RTDelay will be zero or negligible.

   When the Qualified and Corresponding Packets are a TCP-SYN and a TCP-
   SYN-ACK, then RTD_fwd == RTD_HS_fwd.

   When the Qualified and Corresponding Packets are a TCP-SYN-ACK and a
   TCP-ACK, then RTD_rev == RTD_HS_rev.

   The REQUIRED Composition Function for a singleton of Round-trip Delay
   for the connection Hand Shake:

Internet-Draft              Initial Registry                October 2018


   RTDelay_HS = RTD_HS_fwd + RTD_HS_rev

   The definition of Round-trip Loss Count uses the nomenclature
   developed above, based on observation of the TCP header sequence
   numbers and storing the sequence number gaps observed.  Packet Losses
   can be inferred from:

   o  Out-of-order segments: TCP segments are transmitted with
      monotonically increasing sequence numbers, but these segments may
      be received out of order.  Section 3 of [RFC4737] describes the
      notion of "next expected" sequence numbers which can be adapted to
      TCP segments (for the purpose of detecting reordered packets).
      Observation of out-of-order segments indicates loss on the path
      prior to the OP, and creates a gap.

   o  Duplicate segments: Section 2 of [RFC5560] defines identical
      packets and is suitable for evaluation of TCP packets to detect
      duplication.  Observation of duplicate segments *without a
      corresponding gap* indicates loss on the path following the OP
      (because they overlap part of the delivered sequence numbers
      already observed at OP).

   Each observation of an out-of-order or duplicate infers a singleton
   of loss, but composition of Round-trip Loss Counts will be conducted
   over a measurement interval which is synonymous with a single TCP
   connection.

   With the above observations in the Forward direction over a
   measurement interval, the count of out-of-order and duplicate
   segments is defined as RTL_fwd.  Comparable observations in the
   Reverse direction are defined as RTL_rev.

   For a measurement interval (corresponding to a single TCP
   connection), T0 to Tf, the REQUIRED Composition Function for a the
   two single-direction counts of inferred loss is:

   RTLoss = RTL_fwd + RTL_rev

10.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

10.3.1.  Reference Methods

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   The foundation methodology for this metric is defined in Section 4 of
   [RFC7323] using the Timestamp Option with modifications that allow
   application at a mid-path Observation Point (OP) [RFC7011].  Further
   details and applicable heuristics were derived from [Strowes] and
   [Trammell-14].

   The Traffic Filter at the OP is configured to observe a single TCP
   connection.  When the SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK handshake occurs, it offers
   the first opportunity to measure both RTD_fwd (on the SYN to SYN-ACK
   pair) and RTD_rev (on the SYN-ACK to ACK pair).  Label this singleton
   of RTDelay as RTDelay_HS (composed using the forward and reverse
   measurement pair).  RTDelay_HS SHALL be treated separately from other
   RTDelays on data-bearing packets and their ACKs.  The RTDelay_HS
   value MAY be used as a sanity check on other Composed values of
   RTDelay.

Internet-Draft              Initial Registry                October 2018


   For payload bearing packets, the OP measures the time interval
   between observation of a packet with Sequence Number s, and the
   corresponding ACK with same Sequence number.  When the payload is
   transferred from host A to host B, the observed interval is RTD_fwd.

   Because many data transfers are unidirectional (say, in the Forward
   direction from host A to host B), it is necessary to use pure ACK
   packets with Timestamp (TSval) and their Timestamp value echo to
   perform a RTD_rev measurement.  The time interval between observation
   of the ACK from B to A, and the corresponding packet with Timestamp
   echo (TSecr) is the RTD_rev.

   Delay Measurement Filtering Heuristics:

   If Data payloads were transferred in both Forward and Reverse
   directions, then the Round-Trip Time Measurement Rule in Section 4.1
   of [RFC7323] could be applied.  This rule essentially excludes any
   measurement using a packet unless it makes progress in the transfer
   (advances the left edge of the send window, consistent
   with[Strowes]).

   A different heuristic from [Trammell-14] is to exclude any RTD_rev
   that is larger than previously observed values.  This would tend to
   exclude Reverse measurements taken when the Application has no data
   ready to send, because considerable time could be added to RTD_rev
   from this source of error.

   @@@@ Note that the above Heuristic assumes that host A is sending
   data.  Host A expecting a download would mean that this heuristic
   should be applied to RTD_fwd.

   The statistic calculations to summarize the delay (RTDelay) SHALL be
   performed on the conditional distribution, conditioned on successful
   Forward and Reverse measurements which follow the Heuristics.

   Method for Inferring Loss:

   The OP tracks sequence numbers and stores gaps for each direction of
   transmission, as well as the next-expected sequence number as in
   [Trammell-14] and [RFC4737].  Loss is inferred from Out-of-order
   segments and Duplicate segments.

   Loss Measurement Filtering Heuristics:

   [Trammell-14] adds a window of evaluation based on the RTDelay.

   Distinguish Re-ordered from OOO due to loss, because sequence number
   gap is filled during the same RTDelay window.  Segments detected as

   re-ordered according to [RFC4737] MUST reduce the Loss Count inferred
   from Out-of-order segments.

   Spurious (unneeded) retransmissions (observed as duplicates) can also
   be reduced this way, as described in [Trammell-14].

   Sources of Error:

   The principal source of RTDelay error is the host processing time to
   return a packet that defines the termination of a time interval.  The
   heuristics above intend to mitigate these errors by excluding
   measurements where host processing time is a significant part of
   RTD_fwd or RTD_rev.

   A key source of RTLoss error is observation loss, described in
   section 3 of [Trammell-14].

   T0 the start of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time" as
      specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of

      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  The end of the measurement interval MAY be controlled
      by the measured connection, where the second pair of FIN and ACK
      packets exchanged between host A and B effectively ends the
      interval.

   For RTDelay_HS -- the Round trip delay of the Handshake.

   For RTLoss -- the count of lost packets.

   For each <statistic>, one of the following sub-sections apply:

10.4.2.1.  Mean

   The mean SHALL be calculated using the conditional distribution of
   all packets with a finite value of Round-trip delay (undefined delays
   are excluded), a single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   See section 4.2.2 of [RFC6049] for details on calculating this
   statistic, and 4.2.3 of [RFC6049].

   Mean  The time value of the result is expressed in units of seconds,
      as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 9
      (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.000000001
      seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit
      NTP timestamp as per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905]

10.4.2.2.  Min

   The minimum SHALL be calculated using the conditional distribution of
   all packets with a finite value of Round-trip delay (undefined delays
   are excluded), a single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   See section 4.3.2 of [RFC6049] for details on calculating this
   statistic, and 4.3.3 of [RFC6049].

   Min  The time value of the result is expressed in units of seconds,
      as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 9
      (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.000000001
      seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit
      NTP timestamp as per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905]

10.4.2.3.  Max

   The maximum SHALL be calculated using the conditional distribution of
   all packets with a finite value of Round-trip delay (undefined delays
   are excluded), a single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   See section 4.3.2 of [RFC6049] for a closely related method for
   calculating this statistic, and 4.3.3 of [RFC6049].  The formula is
   as follows:

            Max = (FiniteDelay [j])

                  such that for some index, j, where 1 <= j <= N
                  FiniteDelay[j] >= FiniteDelay[n] for all n

   Max  The time value of the result is expressed in units of seconds,
      as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 9
      (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.000000001
      seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit
      NTP timestamp as per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905]

12.1.9.  Reference Specification(s)

   [RFC3611][RFC4566][RFC6776][RFC6792][RFC7003]

12.2.  Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary
   details related to the metric definition, including the RFC reference
   and values of input factors, called fixed parameters.  Section 3.2 of
   [RFC7003] provides the reference information for this category.

12.2.1.  Reference Definition

   Packets Discarded in Bursts:

   The total number of packets discarded during discard bursts.  The
   measured value is unsigned value.  If the measured value exceeds
   0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an over-
   range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable, the value
   0xFFFFFF MUST be reported.

12.2.2.  Fixed Parameters

   Fixed Parameters are input factors that must be determined and
   embedded in the measurement system for use when needed.  The values
   of these parameters is specified in the Registry.

   Threshold: 8 bits, set to value = 3 packets.

   The Threshold is equivalent to Gmin in [RFC3611], i.e., the number of
   successive packets that must not be discarded prior to and following
   a discard packet in order for this discarded packet to be regarded as
   part of a gap.  Note that the Threshold is set in accordance with the
   Gmin calculation defined in Section 4.7.2 of [RFC3611].

   Interval Metric flag: 2 bits, set to value 11=Cumulative Duration

   This field is used to indicate whether the burst/gap discard metrics
   are Sampled, Interval, or Cumulative metrics [RFC6792]:

   I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the most
   recent measurement interval duration between successive metrics
   reports.

   I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
   accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.

   Senders MUST NOT use the values I=00 or I=01.

12.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.  For the Burst/Gap Discard
   Metric, it appears that the only guidance on methods of measurement
   is in Section 3.0 of [RFC7003] and its supporting references.
   Relevant information is repeated below, although there appears to be
   no section titled "Method of Measurement" in [RFC7003].

12.3.1.  Reference Method

   Metrics in this block report on burst/gap discard in the stream
   arriving at the RTP system.  Measurements of these metrics are made
   at the receiving end of the RTP stream.  Instances of this metrics
   block use the synchronization source (SSRC) to refer to the separate
   auxiliary Measurement Information Block [RFC6776], which describes
   measurement periods in use (see [RFC6776], Section 4.2).

   This metrics block relies on the measurement period in the
   Measurement Information Block indicating the span of the report.
   Senders MUST send this block in the same compound RTCP packet as the
   Measurement Information Block.  Receivers MUST verify that the
   measurement period is received in the same compound RTCP packet as
   this metrics block.  If not, this metrics block MUST be discarded.

12.3.2.  Stream Type and Stream Parameters

   Since RTCP-XR Measurements are conducted on live RTP traffic, the
   complete description of the stream is contained in SDP messages that
   proceed the establishment of a compatible stream between two or more
   communicating hosts.  See Run-time Parameters, below.

12.3.3.  Output Type and Data Format

   The output type defines the type of result that the metric produces.

   o  Value: Packets Discarded in Bursts

   o  Data Format: 24 bits

   o  Reference: Section 3.2 of [RFC7003]

12.3.4.  Metric Units

   The measured results are apparently expressed in packets, although
   there is no section of [RFC7003] titled "Metric Units".

12.3.5.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-Time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.  However, the values of these
   parameters is not specified in the Registry, rather these parameters
   are listed as an aid to the measurement system implementor or user
   (they must be left as variables, and supplied on execution).

   The Data Format of each Run-time Parameter SHALL be specified in this
   column, to simplify the control and implementation of measurement
   devices.

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].

   SDP Parameters: As defined in [RFC4566]

   Session description v= (protocol version number, currently only 0)

   o= (originator and session identifier : username, id, version number,
   network address)

   measurement has been removed. * Explanation of Conditional delay
   distribution.

   Version 03 addressed Phil Eardley's comments and suggestions in
   sections 1-4. and resolved the definition of Percentiles.

   Version 04 * All section 4 parameters reference YANG types for
   alternate data formats. * Discussion has concluded that usecase(s)
   for machine parse-able registry columns are not needed.

   Version 05 * Revised several Poisson streams to Periodic, sections 4
   & 5. * Addition of ICMP (ping) metrics in section 9. * First
   implementation of Passive TCP RTT metrics in section 10.

14.  Security Considerations

   These registry entries represent no known security implications for
   Internet Security.  Each referenced Metric contains a Security
   Considerations section.

15.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to populate The Performance Metric Registry defined
   in [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] with the values defined above.

   See the IANA Considerations section of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] for additional requests and
   considerations.
