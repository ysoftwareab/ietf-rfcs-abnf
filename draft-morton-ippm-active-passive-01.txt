   Active and Passive Metrics and Methods (and everything in-between)
                  draft-morton-ippm-active-passive-01

Abstract

   This memo provides clear definitions for Active and Passive
   performance assessment.  The construction of Metrics and Methods can
   be described as Active or Passive.  Methods can take on some of the
   attributes of both, and we refer to these as Hybrid Methods.

1.  Introduction

   The adjectives "active" and "passive" have been used for many years
   to distinguish two different classes of Internet performance
   assessment.  The first Passive and Active Measurement (PAM)
   Conference was held in 2000, but the earliest proceedings available
   on-line are from the second PAM conference in 2001
   [https://www.ripe.net/ripe/meetings/pam-2001].

   The notions of "active" and "passive" are well-established.  In
   general:

      An Active metric or method depends on a dedicated measurement
      packet stream.

      A Passive metric or method depends solely on observation of one or
      more packet streams.  The streams only serve measurement when they
      are observed for that purpose, and are present whether
      measurements take place or not.

   As new techniques for assessment emerge it is helpful to have clear
   definitions of these notions.  This memo provides more detailed

Internet-Draft             Active and Passive              February 2015


   definitions and discusses means to evaluate new techniques as they
   emerge.

   This memo provides definitions for Active and Passive Metrics and
   Methods based on long usage in the Internet measurement community,
   and especially the Internet Engineering Task Force.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Purpose and Scope

   The scope of this memo is to define and describe Active and Passive
   versions of metrics and methods which are consistent with the long-
   time usage of these adjectives in the Internet measurement community
   and especially the Internet Engineering Task Force.

   Further, this memo's purpose includes describing multiple dimensions
   in which to evaluate methods as they emerge.

3.  Terms and Definitions

   This section defines the key terms of the memo.

3.1.  Performance Metric

   The standard definition of a quantity, produced in an assessment of
   performance and/or reliability of the network, which has an intended
   utility and is carefully specified to convey the exact meaning of a
   measured value.  (This definition is consistent with that of
   Performance Metric in RFC 2330 and RFC 6390).

3.2.  Method of Measurement

   The procedure or set of operations having the object of determining a
   Measured Value or Measurement Result.

3.3.  Observation Point

   See section 2 of [RFC7011] for this definition (a location in the
   network where packets can be observed), and related definitions.  The
   comparable term defined in IETF literature on Active measurement is
   Measurement Point, see section 4.1 of [RFC5835].  Two terms have come
   into use describing somewhat actions at the identified point in the
   network path.

3.4.  Active Methods

   Active measurement methods have the following attributes:

   1.  Commonly, the packet stream of interest is generated as the basis
       of measurement.  A packet stream may be generated to increase
       traffic load, but the loading stream itself may not be measured.

   2.  The packets in the stream of interest have fields (or are
       augmented or modified to include fields) which are dedicated to
       measurement.  Since measurement usually requires determining the
       corresponding packets at multiple measurement points, a sequence
       number is the most common information dedicated to measurement.

   3.  The Source and Destination of the packet stream are usually known
       a' priori.

   4.  Packet stream characteristics are known at the Source at least,
       and may be communicated to Destination as part of the method.

   When adding traffic to the network for measurement, Active Methods
   influence the quantities measured to some degree, and those
   performing tests should take steps to quantify the effect(s) and/or
   minimize such effects.

3.5.  Active Metric

   An Active Metric incorporates one or more of the aspects of Active
   Methods in the metric definition.

   For example, IETF metrics for IP performance (developed according to
   the [RFC2330] framework) include the Source packet stream
   characteristics as metric input parameters, and also specify the
   packet characteristics (Type-P) and Source and Destination IP
   addresses (with their implications on both stream treatment and
   interfaces associated with measurement points).

3.6.  Passive Methods

   Passive measurement methods are based on observations of undisturbed
   packet traffic.  Some passive methods simply observe and collect
   information on all packets that pass Observation Point(s), while
   others filter the packets as a first step and only collect
   information on packets that match the filter criteria.

   It is common that passive methods are conducted at one or more
   Observation Points.  Passive methods to assess Performance Metrics
   often require multiple observation points, e.g., to assess latency of

Internet-Draft             Active and Passive              February 2015


   packet transfer across a network path between two Observation Points.
   In this case, the observed packets must include enough information to
   determine the corresponding packets at different Observation Points.

   Communication of the observations (in some form) to a collector is an
   essential aspect of Passive Methods.  In some configurations, the
   traffic load associated with results export to a collector may
   influence the network performance.  However, the collection of
   results is not unique to Passive Methods, and the load from
   management and operations of measurement systems must always be
   considered for potential effects on the measured values.

3.7.  Passive Metric

   Passive Metrics apply to observations of packet traffic (traffic
   flows in [RFC7011]).

   Passive performance metrics are assessed independent of the packets
   or traffic flows, and solely through observation.  Some refer to such
   assessments as "out-of-band".

   One example of passive performance metrics for IP packet transfer can
   be found in ITU-T Recommendation Y.1540, where the metrics are
   defined on the basis of reference events as packet pass reference
   points, so the metrics are agnostic to the distinction between active
   and passive when packet correspondence can be derived from the
   observed stream when required.

3.8.  Hybrid Methods and Metrics

   Methods of Measurement which use a combination of Active Methods and
   Passive Methods, to assess Active Metrics, Passive Metrics, or a new
   metrics derived from the observations.  ITU-T Recommendation Y.1540
   defines metrics are applicable to the hybrid category, since packet
   correspondence at different observation/reference points could be
   derived from "fields which are dedicated to measurement", but
   otherwise the methods are passive.

4.  Discussion

   If we compare the Active and Passive Methods, there are at least two
   dimensions on which methods can be evaluated.  This evaluation space
   may be useful when a method is a combination of the two alternative
   methods.

   The two dimensions (initially chosen) are:

   1.  The degree to which the measured stream effects overall network
       conditions.  There is also the notion of time averages - a
       measurement stream may have significant effect while it is
       present, but the stream is only generated 0.1% of the time.  On
       the other hand, observations alone have no effect on network
       performance.  To keep things simple, we consider the stream
       effect only when it is present.

   2.  The methodological advantages of knowing the source stream
       characteristics, and having complete control of the stream
       characteristics.  For example, knowing the number of packets in a
       stream allows more efficient operation of the measurement
       receiver, and so is an asset for active measurement methods.
       Passive methods (with no sample filter) have few clues available
       to anticipate what the protocol first packet observed will use or
       how many packets will comprise the flow, but once the standard
       protocol of a flow is known the possibilities narrow (for some
       compliant flows).

   There are a few examples we can plot on a two-dimensional space.  We
   can anchor the dimensions with reference point descriptions.

   We recognize that method categorization could be based on additional
   dimensions, but this would require a different graphical approach.

   For example, "effect of measured stream on network conditions" could
   easily be further qualified into:

   1.  effect on the performance of the measured stream itself: for
       example, choosing a packet marking or DSCP resulting in domain
       treatment as a real-time stream (as opposed to default/best-
       effort marking.

   2.  effect on unmeasured flows that share the path and/or
       bottlenecks: for example, an extremely sparse measured stream of
       minimal size packets typically has little effect on other flows
       (and itself), while a stream designed to characterize path
       capacity may effect all other flows passing through the capacity
       bottleneck (including itself).

   3.  effect on network conditions, resulting in network adaptation:
       for example, a network monitoring load and congestion conditions
       might change routing, placing some flows to alternate paths to
       mitigate the congestion.

   As suggestions emerge we will examine the possibilities.

4.1.  Discussion of PDM

   In [I-D.elkins-ippm-pdm-option], an IPv6 Option Header is described
   which (when added to the stream at strategic interfaces) supports
   performance measurements.  This method processes a user traffic
   stream and adds "fields which are dedicated to measurement".  Thus:

   o  The method may have a small effect on the measured stream and
      other streams in the network.

   o  The measured stream has unknown characteristics until it is
      processed to add the PDM Option header.

   We conclude that this is a Hybrid method, having at least one
   characteristic of both active and passive methods.

4.2.  Discussion of "Coloring" Method

   Draft [I-D.tempia-opsawg-p3m], proposed to color packets by re-
   writing a field of the stream at strategic interfaces to support
   performance measurements.  This method processes a user traffic
   stream and inserts "fields which are dedicated to measurement".
   Thus:

   o  The method may have a small effect on the measured stream and
      other streams in the network (smaller than PDM above).

Internet-Draft             Active and Passive              February 2015


   o  The measured stream has unknown characteristics until it is
      processed to add the coloring in the header, and the stream could
      be measured and time-stamped during that process.

   We note that [I-D.chen-ippm-coloring-based-ipfpm-framework] proposes
   a method similar to [I-D.tempia-opsawg-p3m], and ippm-list discussion
   indicates [I-D.chen-ippm-coloring-based-ipfpm-framework] may be
   covered by the same IPR as [I-D.tempia-opsawg-p3m].

   We conclude that this is a Hybrid method, having at least one
   characteristic of both active and passive methods.

5.  Security considerations

   When considering privacy of those involved in measurement or those
   whose traffic is measured, there is sensitive information
   communicated and observed at observation and measurement points
   described above.  We refer the reader to the privacy considerations
   described in the Large Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance
   (LMAP) Framework [I-D.ietf-lmap-framework], which covers active and
   passive measurement techniques and supporting material on measurement
   context.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo makes no requests for IANA consideration.
