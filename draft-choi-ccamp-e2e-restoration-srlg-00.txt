1. Introduction 
 
  Current End-to-End recovery in optical network has three types of 
  recovery schemes : 1+1 uni-directional protection, 1+1 Bi-directional 
  and shared mesh restoration. In 1+1 unidirectional, a dedicated, 
  resource-disjoint alternate path is pre-established to protect the 
  failed LSP. Traffic is simultaneously sent on both paths and received 
  from one of the functional paths by the end nodes. The 1+1 Bi-
  directional recovery has also a dedicated, resource-disjoint 
  alternate path pre-established. Under normal conditions, the traffic 
  from the working path is received by nodes A and B. A failure 
  affecting the working path results in both A and B switches to the 
  traffic on the protection path in the respective directions. Shared 
  mesh restoration refers to schemes under which protection paths for 
  multiple LSPs share common link and node resources[2],[3]. These 
  recovery schemes may be difficult to support efficient resource 
  restoration due to lack of disjointness between working path and 
  backup path. Therefore we suggest that the end-to-end restoration 
  with SRLG to reduce the amount of information for route computation 
  and to provide complete disjointness of physical or logical resources.  
   
  This draft describes the scenario and signaling extension to support 
  efficient end-to-end restoration with SRLG of an entire LSP from the 
  source to the destination in pre-OTN network. Pre-OTN networks in 
  which a failure may be masked by intermediated O/E/O based optical 
  line system are transport networks that have a GMPSL-based control 
  plane and various transport plane technologies (such as Optical cross

  connects and Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers, etc.) which separate 
  control plane and transport plane in optical network. The restoration 
  scheme should be timely recovery from failures and also be resource 
  efficient and flexible to meet requirements. This draft describes the 
  protocol specific procedures for GMLS(Generalized Multi-Protocol 
  Label Switching) RSVP-TE (Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic 
  Engineering) signaling to support end-to-end restoration with SRLG 
  for disjointness of working path and backup path which support entire 
  LSP from the source to the destination.  
   
  Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) allow the definition of resources or 
  groups of resources that share the same risk of failure.  The 
  knowledge of SRLGs may be used to compute diverse paths that can be 
  used for protection. The concept of SRLG(Shared Risk Link Group)has 
  been used for computing a path that is disjoint from a set of links 
  sharing the same risk. For the purpose, links sharing the same risk 
  are grouped to have the same SRLG value. When tow or more links share 
  the same risk, it means that when a link failed, the other can fail 
  at the same time.  Network can be planned to recover from failures 
  due to a risk(represented by an SRLG) using different mechanism. The 
  SRLG concept generates another dimension to the existing constraint-
  based path computation methods traditionally used in hierarchical 
  networks. The SRLG constraints come in addition to the common traffic 
  engineering constrains such as bandwidth availability, link metrics 
  and TE attributes.  
   
  Shared mesh restoration reduce the resource requirements by allowing 
  multiple LSPs to share common link and node resources. In this scheme, 
  the restoration path is pre-computed and resource capability is on-
  demand with signaling message. This requires restoration signaling 
  along the working path. 
   
  We propose the requirements and scenario for end-to-end restoration 
  with SRLG for definitive disjointness of resources. Furthermore, we 
  also describe the signaling extension for restoration scheme 
  suggested. For the disjointness of end-to-end restoration path from 
  failed working path, we extend the RSVP-TE signaling message 
  including SRLG.  
    
    
2. Terminology 
   
  This draft uses the GMPSL nodes to support the ability handling SRLG. 
  Therefore we summarize the function of each node. 
   
  o Recovery GMPLS Nodes 
   
     - Ingress GMPLS node of end-to-end LSP with SRLG : The ingress 
     GMPLS node of an End-to-End LSP is where the working traffic may 
     be switchover the backup end-to-end LSP. The ingress node with 
     SRLG can compute the disjoint path between working path and backup 
     path in advance for the reducing the computational complexity of

     the resource planning after failure and is used to search the 
     relationships between failed working path and backup path.  
   
     - Egress GMPLS node of end-to-end LSP with SRLG : The egress GMPSL 
     node of an End-to-End LSP is where the working traffic may be 
     selected from either the working or the backup end-to-end LSP. The 
     egress node with SRLG also can select the backup path disjointed 
     from working path considering SRLGs. 
   
     - Intermediate GMPLS node of an end-to-end LSP with SRLG : 
     Intermediate node is a node along either the working or backup 
     end-to-end LSP route between the corresponding ingress and egress 
     nodes. It only propagates the SRLG values to the egress or ingress 
     without processing them.  
   
 
3. Requirements for End-to-End restoration with SRLG 
 
3.1 Overview of Restoration Requirements 
 
  This section summarizes the end-to-end recovery for pre-OTN networks. 
  We refer [1] to describe the history of restoration in this section. 
  The recovery mechanisms have protection and restoration. The end-to-
  end path protection and restoration refer to the recovery of an 
  entire LPS from the initiator (Ingress LSR) to the terminator (Egress 
  LSR). The LSP consists of initiator, terminator and a set of 
  intermediate nodes whether it is primary path or not backup path. 
  (The protection mechanism is not the scope of this document.)  
   
  We have two classification of restoration as following. 
   
  Restoration 
     -Pre-computation of path and on-demand selection of resource 
     -On-demand computation of path and pre-selection of resource 
   
  In general, restoration schemes are required to operate in a stable 
  manner to maximize the network reliability and optimization.  
   
  The five restoration phases are commonly accepted when the failure 
  occurred in pre-OTN networks. 
   
     Phase 1 : Failure Detection      --Transport plane 
      
        Failure detection should be handled at the layer closet to the 
        failure. One measure of failure detection at the transport 
        plane is detecting loss of light (LOL) which we show this draft.  
        Upon failure condition, the transport plane must trigger the 
        control plane for subsequent actions through the use of GMPSL 
        signaling capabilities. 
         
     Phase 2: Failure isolation/localization--Transport/Control plane 
   
 
 
Choi et al    Expires - December 2003                         [Page 4]

              End-to-End restoration with SRLG               June 2003 
 
        Failure Localization requires communication between nodes to 
        determine where the failure has occurred and information to 
        perform the subsequent recovery action at the LSP end points.  
   
     Phase 3: Failure notification         --Control plane 
   
        Failure Notification is used to inform intermediate nodes that 
        a LSP failure has occurred and has been detected to inform the 
        recovery deciding entities that the corresponding service is 
        not available.  Notification message exchanges through a GMPSL 
        control plane may not follow the same path as LSP for which 
        these messages carry the status. 
   
     Phase 4: Recovery     --Control plane 
   
        In this draft, we consider the recovery as the restoration, and 
        when applicable, recovery resource are provisioned using GMPSL 
        signaling capabilities.  
   
     Phase 5: Reversion (normalization)    --Control plane  
      
        The process that the original working path has been repaired 
        and begins to carry the traffic again. 
         
  Now, we described the overview of end-to-end restoration in this 
  section. We want to represent the requirements for end-to-end 
  restoration with SRLG for support efficient and simultaneous recovery 
  from failure. The requirements with SRLG should not only include the 
  contents in 3.1 but also add some functions or features in the 
  following section.    
 
3.2 Requirements for End-to-End restoration with SRLG 
   
  In this draft, we describe the end-to-end recovery not the link 
  recovery. In the link recovery with SRLG, all the connections that 
  traverse the failed link should be replaced to the new link. Although 
  the link recovery  has the shorter recovery latency than end-to-end 
  recovery, it has been reported that end-to-end restoration schemes 
  are more economical and optimal than link recovery in the sense that 
  they require much lower redundant network resource and pre-
  computation of resource. Moreover end-to-end recovery is more 
  feasible than link recovery with available technologies. Considering 
  this reasons, we want to support the end-to-end restoration and 
  describe the requirements for end-to-end restoration. 
   
  They are the lists of requirements for restoration. 
   
  (1) Requirements on efficiency of working and recovery resource 
   
  - A restoration scheme with SRLG should allow disjoint path (node, 
  link, and logical structure) between the working path and the backup 
  path.

              End-to-End restoration with SRLG               June 2003 
 
   
  - It should allow sharing of recovery bandwidth among multiple 
  recovery path, when possible, to enable efficient use of recovery 
  bandwidth because the SRLG concept has the multiple link common risk 
  sharing resources.  
   
  (2) Requirements on SRLG properties  
   
  - It should support multiple failure based on group recovery which 
  recover the entire path. 
   
  - It should restrict the TE element such as SRLG. 
   
  - It should allow abstraction of path information between initiator 
  and terminator. 
   
  - It should reduce or hide the network topology information when the 
  working path or backup path would be computed. 
   
  - A restoration scheme with SRLG should allow aggregated restoration 
  actions, ensuring scalability. 
   
  (3) Requirements on Recovery actions 
   
  - It should ensure reliable fault recovery action, providing the 
  control plane is connected. 
   
  - It should support recovery within bounded time constraints and may 
  be compliant with generally used recovery times because of reduction 
  of information dealt in path computation and selection. 
   
  - It should test and verify the availability of the restoration path 
  with SRLG before its actual use. In other words, the restoration path 
  binding SRLG should test the SRLG confirmation. This test may occur 
  when the restoration path is provisioned or after it is provisioned 
  but before actual restoration action occurs and the path starts being 
  used.  
   
  - It should guarantee that restoration actions correctly deliver 
  traffic from primary path to the respective back up path, such that 
  the restoration actions do not result in any unintended connections 
  or unintended diversion of traffic. 
   
  - It should support CRANKBACK operation of its restoration actions. 
  The dynamic restoration signaling using SRLG may utilize CRANKGACK to 
  successively try different paths until a path with available 
  resources is found. 
   
  (4) Requirements on recovery priority  
   
  - It should allow support priority-based recovery of failed LSPs.

              End-to-End restoration with SRLG               June 2003 
 
  - It should allow support of service classes with different recovery 
  time guarantee.  
   
  (5) Requirements on failure notification  
   
  - A restoration scheme with SRLG should be equipped with a failure 
  notification mechanism considering SRLG that guarantees prompt and 
  reliable delivery of notification of faults in the data plane to a 
  deciding entity that is in charge of recovering the fault. 
   
   
4. Scenario for End-to-End restoration with SRLG  
   
  In this section, a failure recovery scenario is described based on 
  shared mesh restoration with separation of control plane and 
  transport plane. Every node (OXC) has and OXC switch in transport 
  plane and controller in control plane which is supported to GSMP 
  master-slave. The detailed algorithms or schemes may accepted in this 
  scenario  
   
  Shared mesh restoration LSP with SRLG is pre-computation but no 
  allocated in resource in advance. In other words, upon the failure, 
  the allocation of resource on path establishment occurs, therefore 
  shred-mesh restoration LSP can manage the efficient resource and can 
  optimize the network resource due to pre-computation. 
    
  When a failure occurs, the following procedure is carried out: 
     
     A downstream node close to the failure detects it. If the path is 
     bi-directional, both a downstream node and an upstream node detect 
     failure. Upon failure, the transport node detect it through Loss 
     of Light(LOL)/Loss of Signal(LOS) of physical resource in 
     transport layer. The detecting node should report the detection of 
     failure  
      
     The node which detects failure and report the detection transmits 
     Notify message with failed LSP(Working Path) ID and SRLG Lists in 
     PROTECTION Object which can be included in Notify message to act a 
     SWITCHOVER Request for end-to-end restoration. This process occurs 
     in Control plane in pre-OTN network which consists of control 
     plane and transport plane which shows in fig 1. Each OXC has the 
     controller and switch that is connected by GSMP master-slave[6]. 
     Pre-OTN network uses this relationship of GSMP master-slave, which 
     is report to controller in detection of failure in transport plane, 
     therefore each intermediate controller of OXC propagates  the 
     Notify message with failed LSP ID and SRLG and report failure in 
     Working path to the Ingress or Egress OXC. One key requirement for 
     this process is that the intermediate OXC should be able to notify 
     the failed LSP or node responsible for restoring the connections 
     when failures occur, without processing the message or modifying 
     the state of the affected connections for fast restoration.

              End-to-End restoration with SRLG               June 2003 
 
     The Ingress or Egress OXC sends the Notify response message for 
     confirmation to detection node of failure through the control 
     plane.  
      
     The Ingress or Egress OXC sends RSVP-TE signaling message for 
     restoration path based on database which contains the Working LSP 
     ID, SRLG lists for working LSP, the Backup LSP ID and SRLG lists 
     for Backup LSP corresponding the Working path. We can use the Path 
     message for restoration path including BACKUP ROUTE Object with 
     SRLG which represents the relationship for failed LSP and backup 
     LSP. The Path message which have the BACKUP ROUTE Object may be 
     given the highest priority among other messages. The OXC received 
     in Path message accepts the Path establishment, if the OXC has 
     available resources, and sends the RESV message.  
      
     If the backup path is established through the procedures, the data 
     of failed Working path should be switched over to the Backup path 
     established. The establishment process is achieved through the 
     control plane each OXC using GSMP master-slave, and the GSMP 
     master-slave can be switchover the data through the orders from 
     master.

              Figure1. OXC structure for control and switch 
   
   
  Figure 2 shows an example of Shared mesh based-restoration with SRLG. 
  One working path, LSP 1 runs from Node 1 to Node 4 through connection 
  with SRLG [s1-s2-s3], and another working path, LSP 2 runs from Node 
  7 to Node 10 through connection with SRLG [s9-s10-s11]. Node 1 can 
  provides data traffic protection by creating a backup LSP that merges 
  with the working LPS at Node 4. We refer to a B-LSP 1 with SRLG [s4-
  s6-s5] as the restoration LSP of LSP1. In the same manner, we refer 
  to B-LSP2 with SLRG [s7-s6-s10]as restoration of LSP2. 
   
  In this situation, if it can be assumed that multiple failure do not 
  occur at a same time, the resource for recovering the working LSPs 
  can be shared. In other words, the resource with SRLG 6 can be shared 
  between the B-LSP1 and B-LSP2. By setting up these backup path, the 
  spare/work capacity ration in the network can be reduced.  
   
  When a failure occurs at a SRLG10 on the working LSP2, the endpoint 
  nodes (both Node 8 and Node9) of the link will detect the failure (if 
  the link is bi-directional). Then the detecting nodes start sending

  Notify message in the control plane through the GSMP master-slave. 
  When a Notify message is received, these nodes send back a Notify 
  response message to the sending node. In the same manner, they 
  propagate the message to their intermediate nodes. 
   
   
5. Signaling extension  
 
  In this section, we describe RSVP-TE signaling extension to extend 
  its applicability to end-to-end LSP restoration in pre-OTN network. 
  Also we can show the message format and its definition.

  We describe extension to the PROTECTION object to extend its 
  applicability to end-to-end LSP restoration. In addition to 
  modifications to the format of the PROTECTION object, we extend its 
  usage not only so that the object can be included in the Notify 
  message to act a SWTICHOVER Request action but also so that the 
  object can be included in the PATH, RESV message to protect entire 
  path. The PROTECTION object includes the failed LSP, and failed SRLG 
  ID.   
   
  The format of the PORTJECT object (Class-Num=37, C-Type=TBA by 
  IANA)is as follows: 

       0                   1                   2                   3

5.2 BACKUP ROUTE Object  
   
  The BACKUP ROUTE Object (BRO)is defined to inform the relationship 
  between Working path and backup path which includes resources are 
  being sued by the associated working LSP. This object may also be 
  used to inform SRLGs along the path of a working protecting LSP about 
  which resources are being used by the associated working path. BR 
  object is a new object that the contents are B-LSP ID and a series of 
  associated SRLG. 
   
  The BRO can be present in Path messages. The BRO handles the backup 
  LSP corresponding the failed working LSP and its SRLGs for 
  physical/logical disjointess between working LSP and backup LSP. If a 
  Path message contains multiple BRO, all the BROs are meaningful. The 
  BRO has the following format.

              End-to-End restoration with SRLG               June 2003 
 
  In this section, we consider the verification of end-to-end 
  restoration path. The test of backup path for failed LSP occurs 
  before its actual use and after its provision. We consider the test 
  as SRLG confirmation for backup path. The backup path test may be use 
  new messages for probe with SRLG ID Lists in backup path. This 
  process and message are further study in this draft.   
   
   
7. Conclusion 
 
  This draft describes requirements, scenario, and signaling extensions 
  for end-to-end restoration for control plane-based recovery from data 
  plane failures in pre-OTN network. While there are several scheme for 
  end-to-end restoration, the list of requirements and restoration 
  scheme with SRLG has not been specifically detailed. We identify that 
  the requirements and restoration scheme support disjointness and 
  signaling extension to suggest the restoration scheme is also 
  described. In 6, we consider further study to support test and 
  verification of backup LSP using SRLG.
