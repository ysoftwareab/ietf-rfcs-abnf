Internet-Draft         Message header registration              Sep 2001


1. Introduction

   This specification defines registration procedures for the message
   headers used by Internet mail, newsgroup feeds, HTTP and other
   Internet applications.

   The primary specification for Internet message headers is the
   Internet mail message format specification, RFC 2822 [21], but there
   are many other Internet standards track documents that define
   additional headers within the same namespace, notably MIME [6] and
   related specifications.  Other Internet applications that use MIME,
   such as newsgroup feeds and HTTP web access, also use many of the
   same headers.

   Although in principle each application defines its own set of valid
   headers, exchange of messages between applications (e.g.  mail to
   news gateways), common use of MIME encapsulation, and the possibility
   of common processing for various message types (e.g.  a common
   message archive and retrieval facility) makes it desirable to have a
   single point of reference for standardized headers.  The message
   header registry defined here serves that purpose.

1.1 Structure of this document

   Section Section 2 discusses the purpose of this specification, and
   indicates some sources of information about defined message headers.

   Section Section 3 defines the message header registry, and sets out
   requirements and procedures for creating entries in it.

1.2 Document terminology and conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [9].

      NOTE: indented comments like this provide additional nonessential
      information about the rationale behind this document.

   [[[Editorial comments and questions about outstanding issues are
   provided in triple brackets like this.  These working comments should
   be resolved and removed prior to final publication.]]]

2. Message headers

Internet-Draft         Message header registration              Sep 2001


2.1 Standard and non-standard headers

   Many message headers are defined in standards-track documents, which
   means they have been subjected to a process of community review and
   achieved consensus that they provide a useful and well-founded
   capability.  Many other headers have been defined and adopted for
   private use.

   The registry defined here is intended for headers defined in IETF
   standards-track documents, or those that have achieved a comparable
   level of community review.  Thus, the assignment policy for
   registration of new message headers is [[[ IETF consensus | Standards
   action ]]], as defined by RFC 2434 [17].

   A registry for non-standards-track message headers is at best
   informational, and at least two such sources of information already
   exist:

   o  RFC 2076 [7], as updated [24], contains a list of commonly used
      message headers, and

   o  Dan Bernstein maintains a list of standard and non-standard mail
      message headers [25].


2.2 Definitions of message headers

   RFC 2822 [21] defines a general syntax for Internet message headers.
   It also defines a number of headers for use with Internet mail.
   Additional header names are defined in a variety of standards-track
   RFC documents, including: RFC 1036 [1], RFC 1496 [2], RFC 1505 [3],
   RFC 1766 [4], RFC 1864 [5], RFC 2156 [11], RFC 2183 [12], RFC 2045
   [6], RFC 2110 [8], RFC 2298 [13], RFC 2369 [14], RFC 2421 [16], RFC
   2821 [20], RFC 2912 [22] and RFC 2919 [23].

   Internet applications that use (some of) these message headers
   include Internet mail [20][21], NNTP newsgroup feeds [1], HTTP web
   access [18] and any other that uses MIME [6] encapsulation of message
   content.

3. Registration procedure

   The procedure for registering a message header is:

   1.  Construct a header specification

   2.  Prepare a registration template

Internet-Draft         Message header registration              Sep 2001


   3.  Submit the registration template


3.1 Header specification

   Registration of a new message header starts with construction of a
   proposal that describes the syntax, semantics and intended use of the
   header.  This proposal MUST be published as an RFC.

   A registered header name MUST conform to the syntax defined by RFC
   2822, section 3.6.8, for "field name".  Further, the "." character is
   reserved to indicate a naming sub-structure and MUST NOT be included
   in any registered header name.  Currently, no specific sub-structure
   is defined; if used, any such structure MUST be defined by a
   standards track RFC document.

   It is further RECOMMENDED that characters in a registered message
   header name are restricted to those characters that can be used
   without escaping in a URI [15], namely upper- or lower-case ASCII
   letters, decimal digits, "(", ")", "+", ",", "-", "=", "@", ";", "$",
   "_", "!", "*" and "'".

   The name of a registered header MUST be unique; if an name is already
   assigned to an existing registered header name, some other name must
   be chosen.

   Header names beginning with "X-" or "x-" are reserved for private
   use, and MUST NOT be registered or defined normatively by a standards
   track RFC.

3.2 Registration template

   The registration template for a message header is typically contained
   in the defining document, or may be prepared separately.

   The registration template for a message header contains the following
   information:

   Header name:
      The name requested for the new header.  This MUST conform to the
      header specification details above.

   Specification document:
      A reference to the standards track RFC that defined the header.

   Intended use:
      Specify "general", "mail", "news", "http", "MIME" or cite any
      other standards-track RFC defining the protocol with which the

Internet-Draft         Message header registration              Sep 2001


      header is intended to be used.

   Related information:
      Optionally, citations to additional documents containing further
      information relevant to the defined message header.


3.3 Submission of registration

   The registration is submitted for incorporation in the IANA message
   header registry by one of the following means:

   o  An IANA considerations section in the defining RFC, calling for
      registration of the message header and referencing the
      registration template within the same document.  Registration of
      the header is processed as part of the RFC publication process.

   o  Sending the registration template in an email to the designated
      email address [26].  IANA will register the message header if the
      requested name and the specification document meet the criteria
      stated.


3.4 Change control

   Change control of a header registration is subject to the same
   conditions as the initial registration; i.e.  publication of an IESG-
   approved RFC.

3.5 Comments on header definitions

   Comments on registered message headers should be sent to the IETF-822
   email discussion list [26].

   Comments on proposed message headers should preferably be sent to the
   discusion forum for the specification concerned.  They may also be
   sent to the IETF-822 list [26] if they concern wider implications
   than are addressed by the specification document.

3.6 Location of message header registry

   The message header registry is accessible from IANA's web site [27].

4. Initial registrations

   This specification calls for initial registration of all message
   headers defined in existing standards-track documents.  A list of
   such headers can be found in RFC 2076 [7] and updates [24].  Section

Internet-Draft         Message header registration              Sep 2001


   Section 2.2 of this document contains a list of standards-track
   specifications that define message headers.

   [[[Need to provide list of headers+documents here for initial
   registration?]]]

5. IANA considerations

   This specification calls for:

   o  A new IANA registry for message headers, per section Section 3 of
      this document.  The policy for inclusion in this registry is [[[
      IETF consensus | Standards action ]]], per RFC 2434 [17].

   o  Initial message header registrations, per section Section 4 of
      this document.


6. Security considerations

   No security considerations are introduced by this specification
   beyond those already inherrent in the use of message headers.
