Abstract

     The ability of a hierarchy of PCEs to compute accurate end-to-end
   paths across multiple domains is recognized as an important
   requirement in many applications.
      This document describes extensions to the PCE Communication
   Protocol (PCEP) in order to provide new path-related bandwidth
   metrics, which a PCC, like a H-PCE (either stateful or stateless),
   can use from an erstwhile path computation to deploy multiple LSPs
   (having the same end-points and constraints) without additional
   requests, until either the remaining bandwidth along that path is
   all allocated or a deployment fails.
      This information would also be beneficial for implementing
   abstractions of the domain topology, building the abstract
   connectivity incrementally, based only on really used constraints,
   as soon as path computation results are returned.

Internet-Draft    PCEP residual bandwidth retrieval           May 2017


   Introduction
   Path computation of end-to-end routes spanning multiple domains is a
   key requirement for networks with a centralized path computation
   function (e.g. hierarchical PCE or SDN).
   In such scenarios, a hierarchy of PCEs is often implemented, where,
   as illustrated in [RFC6805], a parent PCE coordinates the operations
   of a set of child (domain) PCEs in order to compute end-to-end paths
   across the network.
   In a hierarchical architecture of PCEs, domain PCEs just know the
   topology of their domains, while the parent PCE has in general
   detailed information about the managed domains and the relevant
   inter-domain links, but not necessarily enough information about the
   internals of each domain, so that it's capable to compute accurately
   an end-to-end path.
   One of the key features of SDN is the support of network
   abstraction, that is, as described in [RFC7926], the capability of
   applying policy to a set of information about a network, in order to
   produce selective information that represents the potential ability
   to connect across the domain.
   The process of abstraction produces a connectivity graph, which can
   be used by the parent PCE to compute an accurate path based on the
   abstracted topology. The main issue is that the connectivity graph
   can be huge, depending on the size of the domain topology and the
   number of end-points defined on the edge of the domain.
   One way to provide similar information is to store the result of
   path computations requested to the child PCEs (performed by e.g. TE-
   tunnels "compute only") and try reusing them if possible to save
   further path computation iterations between parent and child PCEs.
   In any case a selection of path computation constraints has to be
   defined against the abstract topology in order to reduce the number
   of the abstract links or TE-tunnels exported by the connectivity
   graph, as it's impractical to compute or pre-compute all the
   constraints combinations. It's also very important to reduce the
   number of updates of such connectivity information to the parent PCE
   in order not to flood it with a continuous stream of updates.
   The objective of this document is to define an extension to the PCEP
   [RFC5440] providing information about the bandwidth still available
   for future reservations on a given path, that is the minimum
   unreserved bandwidth and the minimum residual bandwidth among all
   the link of that path.
   This is not a new concept to PCEP. In [RFC5541] two objective
   functions are defined, called minimum load path (MLP) and maximum

   residual bandwidth path (MBP). Both of them allow to find paths with
   optimal value of bandwidth-related metrics, defined on a per-link
   basis, considering the links traversed by that path. For example,
   the residual bandwidth of a path is defined as the minimum value of
   the residual bandwidth on each link in the path. Specifying that OF
   inside the SVEC object of a PCReq message, the PCE tries and finds
   the path with the maximum value of the path residual bandwidth.
   Unfortunately, being an objective function, MBP can only be used to
   find a path that optimizes the residual bandwidth, but its value
   cannot be returned for a path computed with some other objectives
   (and also when MBP itself is used), or used as a bound.
   The same applies to the unreserved bandwidth. The difference between
   residual and unreserved bandwidth is well described in [RFC7471]:
      "The calculation of Residual Bandwidth is different than that of
      Unreserved Bandwidth [RFC3630].  Residual Bandwidth subtracts
      tunnel reservations from Maximum Bandwidth (i.e., the link
      capacity) [RFC3630] and provides an aggregated remainder across
      priorities.    Unreserved Bandwidth, on the other hand, is
      subtracted from the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth (the bandwidth
      that can theoretically be reserved) and provides per priority
      remainders.  Residual Bandwidth and Unreserved Bandwidth
      [RFC3630] can be used concurrently, and each has a separate use
      case (e.g., the former can be used for applications like Weighted
      ECMP while the latter can be used for call admission control)".
   Having this information would allow a PCC (e.g. a parent PCE) to
   reuse a path resulting from a path computation to route additional
   LSPs without requesting new path computations (with the same end-
   points and constraints), until the maximum path unreserved bandwidth
   is taken (or a path deployment fails).
   This information would be also beneficial for implementing an
   abstraction of the domain topology by building a domain abstract
   topology incrementally, possibly starting from a simple pre-computed
   base, and adding abstract information as new path computations are
   requested by the client, using only really used constraints.

Internet-Draft    PCEP residual bandwidth retrieval           May 2017


1. Requirements for managing the residual bandwidth as a metric

      Path computation with optimization of the load or of the residual
   bandwidth has been defined as important objective functions in
   [RFC5541].

   Managing the unreserved bandwidth (related to the load) and the
   residual bandwidth of a path as additional metrics, adds the
   capability to return their value, or putting a bound on their value.
   This is an added value in distributed PCE applications, like e.g. in
   ACTN architecture [ACTN-FW] and [PCE-APP]. The following associated
   key requirements are identified for PCEP:

      1.  A PCE supporting this draft MUST have the capability to
   compute end-to-end (E2E) paths with either unreserved bandwidth or
   with residual bandwidth constraints.  It MUST also support the
   combination of these new constraints with existing constraints, like
   IGP metric, TE metric, hop limit, and network performance
   constraints as defined in [RFC5440] and [PCEP-SERV-AWARE].

      2.  A PCC MUST be able to specify either unreserved bandwidth or
   residual bandwidth constraints in a Path Computation Request (PCReq)
   message to be applied during the path computation.

      3.  A PCC MUST be able to request that a PCE optimizes a path
   using either unreserved bandwidth or residual bandwidth as objective
   metric.

      4.  A PCE that supports this specification is not required to
   provide unreserved bandwidth or residual bandwidth path computation
   to any PCC at any time.

          Therefore, it MUST be possible for a PCE to reject a PCReq
   message with reason codes that indicate unreserved bandwidth or
   residual bandwidth is not supported. Furthermore, a PCE that does
   not support this specification will either ignore or reject such
   requests using pre-existing mechanisms, therefore the requests MUST
   be identifiable to legacy PCEs and rejections by legacy PCEs MUST be
   acceptable within this specification.

      5.  A PCE that supports this specification MUST be able to return
   unreserved or residual bandwidth information of the computed path in
   a Path Computation Reply (PCRep) message.

2. New metrics definition

2.1. Link and Path Unreserved bandwidth

   The unreserved bandwidth of a link is the bandwidth available for
   future allocation on the link at a given priority, that is the
   difference between the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth of the link and
   total bandwidth used on that link by LSPs with priority equal or
   lower (higher value) than the specified priority. In order to define
   the path unreserved bandwidth, the following concepts and notation
   need to be introduced:

       o A network comprises of a set of N links {Li, (i=1...N)}.

       o A path of a point to point (P2P) LSP is a list of K links
         {Lpi,(i=1...K)}.

       o The maximum reservable bandwidth of the link Li, named Ri.

       o The bandwidth allocated to LSPs at priority p on the link Li is
         the sum of the bandwidth of all the LSPs passing through the
         link Li with priority >= p, named Bi(p).

       o The unreserved bandwidth at priority p of the link Li is
         Ui(p) = Ri - Bi(p)


       The path unreserved bandwidth at a given priority k is defined
   as the minimum value of the unreserved bandwidth at priority k among
   all the links along the P2P path. Specifically, extending on the
   above mentioned terminology:
      o  Path unreserved bandwidth metric at priority is defined as:
         PU(p) = min {Ui(p), (i=1...K)}

2.2. Link and Path Residual bandwidth

   The residual bandwidth of a link is the bandwidth physically left
   free for future allocation on the link. In order to define the path
   residual bandwidth, the following concepts and notation need to be
   introduced:

       o A network comprises of a set of N links {Li, (i=1...N)}.

Internet-Draft    PCEP residual bandwidth retrieval           May 2017



       o A path of a point to point (P2P) LSP is a list of K links
         {Lpi,(i=1...K)}

       o The maximum bandwidth of the link Li, named Bi.

       o The sum of the bandwidth of all the LSPs passing through the
         link Li, that is the bandwidth allocated on the link, named Ai.

       o The residual bandwidth of the link Li is r(i) = Bi - Ai.


   The path residual bandwidth is defined as the minimum value of the
   residual bandwidth among all the links along the P2P path.
   Specifically, extending on the above mentioned terminology:

      o  Path residual bandwidth metric for the P2P path is defined as:
         PB = min {r(Lpi), (i=1...K)}



3. PCEP protocol extensions

      This section defines PCEP extensions to fulfill the requirements
   outlined in Section 2.  The proposed solution is used to support
   path unreserved bandwidth and path residual bandwidth as additional
   metrics of the PCEP protocol.
   The METRIC object is defined in section 7.8 of [RFC5440], comprising
   metric-value, metric-type (T field) and a flags field comprising a
   number of bit-flags.

   This document defines two new types for the METRIC object:

     T = TBD1: Path Unreserved Bandwidth

   When the T field is set to TBD1, the value of the metric-value field
   is set to the Path Unreserved Bandwidth for the traffic type and
   priority requested in the PCReq message.
   The same format used by [RFC5440] for the BANDWIDTH object body is
   used here to represent the value of a path unreserved bandwidth
   bound or returned value, as shown in the following:

   Editor NOTE: these definitions provide support only of PSC signal
   type. For other signal types (e.g. ODU, WDM) these fields can be
   filled with the number of unreserved or residual fixed containers
   (e.g. 3 ODU0) related to the type of traffic specified in the PCReq.
   This has to be discussed.

   A PCC MAY use the path unreserved or residual bandwidth in a PCReq
   message to request a path meeting the end to end unreserved or
   residual bandwidth requirement.  In this case, the B bit MUST be set
   to suggest a bound (a minimum) for the path residual bandwidth
   metric that must be guaranteed for the PCC to consider the computed
   path as acceptable.  The path unreserved or residual bandwidth
   metrics must be greater than or equal to the value specified in the
   metric-value field.
   The P bit MAY be set to specify the constraint as mandatory, or MAY
   be left cleared to specify the bound as optional.

      A PCC can also use this metric to ask PCE to optimize (that is
   maximize) the path residual bandwidth during path computation.
   In this case, the B bit MUST be cleared.

      A PCE MAY use the path residual bandwidth metric in a PCRep
   message along with a NO-PATH object in the case where the PCE cannot
   compute a path meeting this constraint.
   A PCE can also use this metric to send the computed path residual
   bandwidth metric to the PCC.

4. Non-Understanding/Non-Support Residual Bandwidth

      If a PCE receives a PCReq message containing a METRIC object with
   type PATH UNRESERVED BANDWIDTH or PATH RESIDUAL BANDWIDTH and the
   PCE does not understand or support those metric types, and the P bit
   is clear in the METRIC object header then the PCE SHOULD simply
   ignore the METRIC object as per the processing specified in
   [RFC5440].
      If the PCE does not understand the new METRIC types, and the P
   bit is set in the METRIC object header, then the PCE MUST send a
   PCErr message containing a PCEP-ERROR Object with Error-Type = 4



Lazzeri, et al.       Expires November 12,2017                [Page 9]


Internet-Draft    PCEP residual bandwidth retrieval           May 2017


   (Not supported object) and Error-value = 4 (Unsupported parameter)
   [RFC5440][RFC5541].
      If the PCE understands but does not support the new METRIC type,
   and the P bit is set in the METRIC object header, then the PCE MUST
   send a PCErr message containing a PCEP-ERROR Object with Error-Type
   = 4 (Not supported object) with Error-value = TBD3 (Unsupported path
   unreserved bandwidth constraint) or TBD4 (Unsupported path residual
   bandwidth constraint).
   The path computation request MUST then be cancelled.
      If the PCE understands the new METRIC type, but the local policy
   has been configured on the PCE to not allow network performance
   constraint, and the P bit is set in the METRIC object header, then
   the PCE MUST send a PCErr message containing a PCEP-ERROR Object
   with Error-Type = 5 (Policy violation) with Error-value = TBD5 (Not
   Allowed path unreserved bandwidth constraint) or TBD6 (Not
   Allowed path residual bandwidth constraint). The path computation
   request MUST then be cancelled.


4.1. Mode of Operation

      As explained in [RFC5440], the METRIC object is optional and can
   be used for several purposes.  In a PCReq message, a PCC MAY insert
   one or more METRIC objects:
     o To indicate the metric (path unreserved or path residual
        bandwidth) that MUST be optimized by the path computation
        algorithm.

     o To indicate a bound on the METRIC (path unreserved or path
        residual bandwidth) that MUST NOT be exceeded for the path to be
        considered as acceptable by the PCC.

      In a PCRep message, the PCE MAY insert the METRIC object with an
   Explicit Route Object (ERO) so as to provide the METRIC (residual
   bandwidth) for the computed path.
   The PCE MAY also insert the METRIC object with a NO-PATH object to
   indicate that the metric constraint could not be satisfied.
      The path computation algorithmic aspects used by the PCE to
   optimize a path with respect to a specific metric are outside the
   scope of this document.
       All the rules of processing the METRIC object as explained in
   [RFC5440] are applicable to the new metric types as well.

5. Procedures

   The new metrics defined in this document don't add or change the
   procedures already defined for PCEP protocol in [RFC5440] and
   [RFC5541].

   In particular, the existing objective function MBP is still usable
   as appropriate, being equivalent to the usage of the Path Residual
   Bandwidth metric with the B bit cleared.

   The new metric can be used to define new procedures especially in
   the scope of SDN and ACTN, which are out of the scope of this
   document.

6. IANA considerations

6.1. METRIC types

      IANA maintains the "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)
   Numbers" at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/pcep>.  Within this
   registry IANA maintains one sub-registry for "METRIC object T
   field".
   Two new metric types are defined in this document for the METRIC
   object (specified in [RFC5440]).

       IANA is requested to make the following allocations:

           Value       Description                        Reference
           ----------------------------------------------------------
           TBD1        Path unreserved bandwidth metric   [This I.D.]
           TBD2        Path residual bandwidth metric     [This I.D.]


6.2. New Error-Values

      IANA maintains a registry of Error-Types and Error-values for use
   in PCEP messages.  This is maintained as the "PCEP-ERROR Object
   Error Types and Values" sub-registry of the "Path Computation
   Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry.
      IANA is requested to make the following allocations:

      Four new Error-values are defined for the Error-Type "Not
   supported object" (type 4) and "Policy violation" (type 5).

                         Path residual bandwidth constraint


7. Security Considerations

   This document defines new METRIC types, which do not add any new
   security concerns beyond those discussed in [RFC5440] and [RFC5541]
   in itself.
   In some scenarios, path unreserved bandwidth and path residual
   bandwidth information could be considered sensitive and could be
   used to influence path computation and setup with adverse effect.
   Snooping of PCEP messages with such data, or using PCEP messages for
   network reconnaissance, may give an attacker sensitive information
   about the capabilities of the network.  Thus, such deployment should
   employ suitable PCEP security mechanisms like TCP Authentication
   Option (TCP-AO) [RFC5925] or [PCEPS].
   The Transport Layer Security (TLS) based procedure in [PCEPS] is
   considered as a security enhancement and thus much better suited for
   the sensitive residual bandwidth information.
