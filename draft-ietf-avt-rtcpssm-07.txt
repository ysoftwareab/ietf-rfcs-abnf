Abstract 
    
   This document specifies an extension to the Real-time Transport 
   Control Protocol (RTCP) to use unicast feedback. The proposed 
   extension is useful for single-source multicast sessions such as 
   Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) communication where the traditional 
   model of many-to-many group communication is either not available or 
   not desired. In addition, it can be applied to any group that might 
   benefit from a sender-controlled summarised reporting mechanism.

2. Introduction 

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [1] provides a real-time 
   transport mechanism suitable for unicast or multicast communication 
   between multimedia applications. Typical uses of RTP are for real-
   time or near real-time group communication of audio and video data 
   streams. An important component of the RTP protocol is the control 
   channel, defined as the Real-Time Control Protocol (RTCP). RTCP 
   involves the periodic transmission of control packets between group 
   members, enabling group size estimation and the distribution and 
   calculation of session-specific information such as packet loss and 
   round trip time to other hosts. An additional advantage of providing 
   a control channel for a session is that a third-party session 
   monitor can listen to the traffic to establish network conditions 
   and to diagnose faults based on receiver locations. 
    
   RTP was designed to operate in either a unicast or multicast mode. 
   In multicast mode, it assumes an Any Source Multicast (ASM) group 
   model, where both one-to-many and many-to-many communication are 
   supported via a common group address in the range 224.0.0.0 through 
   239.255.255.255. To enable internet-wide multicast communication, 
   intra-domain routing protocols (those that operate only within a 
   single administrative domain, e.g., DVMRP [15], PIM [16][17]) are 
   used in combination with an Inter-domain routing protocol (those 
     
Chesterfield, et al.  Internet Draft - Expires Jan 2005  [Page 2] 

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback 
 
   that operate across administrative domain borders, e.g., MBGP [18], 
   MSDP [19]). Such routing protocols enable a host to join a single 
   multicast group address and to send to or to receive data from all 
   members in the group with no prior knowledge of the membership.  
   There is a great deal of complexity involved, however at the routing 
   level to support such a multicast service in the network. 
    
   In addition, many-to-many communication is not always available, nor 
   desired by all group applications. For example, with Source-Specific 
   Multicast (SSM) and satellite communication, the multicast 
   distribution channel only supports source-to-receiver traffic. In 
   other cases, such as large ASM groups with a single active data 
   source and many passive receivers, it is sub-optimal to create a 
   full routing-level mesh of multicast sources just for the 
   distribution of RTCP control packets.  Thus an alternative solution 
   is preferable.  
    
   Although a one-to-many multicast topology may simplify routing and 
   may be a closer approximation to the requirements of certain RTP 
   applications, unidirectional communication makes it impossible for 
   receivers in the group to share RTCP feedback information amongst 
   all other group members. Therefore, in this draft, we specify a 
   solution to this problem.  We introduce unicast feedback as a new 
   method to distribute RTCP control information amongst all session 
   members. It is designed to operate under any group communication 
   model, ASM or SSM. The RTP data stream protocol itself is unaltered.
    
   Scenarios under which the unicast feedback method could provide 
   benefit include but are not limited to: 
    
    
   a) SSM groups with a single sender.  
    
      The proposed extensions allow SSM groups that do not have many-
      to-many communication capability to still receive RTP data 
      streams and to continue to participate in the RTP control 
      protocol, RTCP, by using multicast in the source-to-receiver 
      direction and using unicast to send receiver feedback to the 
      source on the standard RTCP port. 
    
   b) One-to-many broadcast networks.  
    
      Unicast feedback may also be beneficial to one-to-many broadcast 
      networks, such as a satellite network with a terrestrial low-
      bandwidth return channel or a broadband cable link. Unlike the 
      SSM network, these networks may have the ability for a receiver 
      to multicast return data to the group.  However, a unicast 
      feedback mechanism may be preferable for routing simplicity. 
    
   c) ASM with a single sender.  
    
      A unicast feedback approach may be used by an ASM application 
      with a single sender, as it would help to prevent overtaxing 
      multicast routing infrastructure that does not scale as

      efficiently. Because it is not more efficient than a standard 
      multicast group RTP communication scenario, it is not expected to 
      replace the traditional mechanism. 
    
   The modifications proposed in this document are intended to 
   supplement the existing RTCP feedback mechanisms described in [1], 
   Section 6. 
    
    
3. Basic Operation 

   This draft proposes two new methods to enable unicast receiver 
   feedback. Each involves the unicasting of RTCP packets to a source 
   whose job it is to re-distribute the information to the members of 
   the group. The source must be able to communicate with all group 
   members in order for either mechanism to work. 
    
   The first method, the 'Simple Feedback Model', is a basic reflection 
   mechanism whereby all Receiver RTCP packets are unicast to the 
   source and subsequently forwarded by the source to all receivers on 
   the multicast RTCP channel. The advantage of using this method is 
   that an existing receiver implementation requires little 
   modification in order to use it. Instead of sending reports to a 
   multicast address, a receiver uses a unicast address to send reports 
   to the source, yet still receives forwarded RTCP traffic on the 
   multicast control data channel. This method also has the advantage 
   of being backwards compatible with standard RTP/RTCP 
   implementations.  
 
   The second method, the 'Sender Feedback Summary Model', is a 
   summarised reporting scheme that provides savings in bandwidth by 
   consolidating Receiver Reports at the source into one summary packet 
   that is then distributed to all the receivers. The advantage of this 
   scheme is apparent for large group sessions where the basic 
   reflection mechanism outlined above generates a large amount of 
   packet forwarding when it replicates all the information to all the 
   receivers. The basic operation of the scheme is similar to the first 
   method in that receivers send feedback via unicast to the source. In 
   the second scheme, however the source distributes summaries of the 
   feedback over the multicast channel.  Thus this technique requires 
   that all session members understand the new summarised packet format 
   outlined in Section 7.1. Additionally, the summarised scheme 
   provides an optional mechanism to send distribution information or 
   histograms about the feedback data reported by the whole group. 
   Potential uses for the compilation of distribution information are 
   addressed in Section 7.4.  
    
   To differentiate between the two reporting methods, a new SDP 
   identifier is created and discussed in Section 10. The reporting 
   method MUST be decided prior to the start of the session. A 
   distribution source MUST NOT change the method during a session. 
    
   In a session using SSM, the network SHOULD prevent any multicast 
   data from the receiver being distributed further than the first hop

   router. Additionally, any data heard from a non-unicast capable 
   receiver by other hosts on the same subnet SHOULD be filtered out by 
   the host IP stack and therefore will not cause problems with respect 
   to the calculation of the Receiver RTCP bandwidth share. 
 
    
4. Definitions 

   Distribution Source:  
        In an SSM context, only one source distributes RTP data and 
        redistributes RTCP information to all receivers. That source is 
        called the distribution source. In order for unicast feedback 
        to work, there MUST be only one session distribution source for 
        any subset of receivers to which RTCP feedback is directed. 
        Note that heterogeneous networks comprised of ASM multiple-
        sender groups, unicast-only clients and/or SSM single-sender 
        receiver groups MAY be connected via translators or mixers to 
        create a single-source group (see Section 9 for details).   
    
   RTP and RTCP Channels:  
        The data distributed from the source to the receivers is 
        referred to as the RTP channel and the control information the 
        RTCP channel. With standard RTP/RTCP, these channels typically 
        share the same multicast address but are differentiated via 
        port numbers as specified in [1]. In an SSM context, the RTP 
        channel is multicast, whereas the RTCP or feedback channel is  
        actually the collection of unicast channels between each 
        receiver and the source. 
    
   Unicast RTCP Feedback Target:  
        For a session defined as having a distribution source A, on 
        ports n for the RTP channel and k for the RTCP channel, the 
        unicast RTCP feedback target is the IP address of Source A on 
        port k unless otherwise stated in the session description. See 
        Section 10 for details on how the address is specified. 
    
   SSRC:  
        Synchronization source. A 32-bit value that uniquely identifies 
        each member in a session. See [1] for further information. 
    
   Report blocks:  
        Report block is the standard terminology for an RTCP reception 
        report.  RTCP [1] encourages the stacking of multiple report 
        blocks in Sender Report (SR) and Receiver Report (RR) packets. 
        As a result, a variable size feedback packet may be created by 
        one source that reports on multiple other sources in the group. 
        The summarised reporting scheme builds upon this model through 
        the inclusion of multiple summary report blocks in one packet. 
        However, stacking of reports from multiple receivers is not 
        permitted in the simple feedback scheme.

5. Packet types 

   The RTCP packet types defined in [1], [6], and [10] are: 
    
   Type       Description                  Payload number 
   ------------------------------------------------------- 
   SR         Sender Report                200

   This document defines one further RTCP packet format: 
    
   Type       Description                    Payload number 
   --------------------------------------------------------- 
   RSI        Receiver Summary Information   208 
    
   Within the Receiver Summary Information packet there are various 
   types of information that may be reported and encapsulated in 
   optional sub-report blocks: 
    
   Report Block Type    Description                 Identifier number 
   ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
   IPv4 Address      IPv4 Unicast Feedback address        0 
   IPv6 Address      IPv6 Unicast Feedback address        1 
   DNS name          DNS name for Unicast Feedback        2 
   -                 - reserved -                         3 
   Loss              Loss distribution                    4 
   Jitter            Jitter distribution                  5 
   RTT               Round trip time distribution         6 
   Cumulative loss   Cumulative loss distribution         7 
   Collisions        SSRC collision list                  8 
   Stats             General statistics                   10 
   Receiver BW       RTCP Receiver Bandwidth              11 
   -                 - reserved -                         13 - 255 
    
   As with standard RTP/RTCP, the various reports may be combined into 
   a single RTCP packet, which should not exceed the path MTU. Packets 
   continue to be sent at a rate that is inversely proportional to the 
   group size in order to scale the amount of traffic generated. 
    
6. Simple feedback model 

6.1 Packet Formats 
    
   The simple feedback model uses the same packet types as traditional 
   RTCP feedback described in [1]. Receivers still generate Receiver 
   Reports with information on the quality of the stream received from 
   the source. The distribution source still must create Sender Reports 
     
Chesterfield, et al.  Internet Draft - Expires Jan 2005  [Page 6] 

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback 
 
   that include timestamp information for stream synchronisation and 
   round trip time calculation. Both senders and receivers are required 
   to send SDES packets as outlined in [1]. The rules for generating 
   BYE and APP packets as outlined in [1] also apply.   
 
6.2 Distribution Source behaviour 
    
   For the simple feedback model, the source MUST provide a basic 
   packet reflection mechanism. It is the default behaviour for any 
   distribution source and is the minimum requirement for acting as a 
   source to a group of receivers using unicast RTCP feedback.  
         
   In this model, the source MUST not stack report blocks received from 
   different SSRCs into one packet for retransmission to the group. 
   Every RTCP packet from each receiver MUST be reflected individually. 
         
   The source (the unicast feedback target) MUST listen for unicast 
   RTCP data sent to the RTCP port. All unicast data received on this 
   port MUST be forwarded by the source to the group on the multicast 
   RTCP channel. If the application can determine that the destination 
   address of an RTCP packet is not a unicast address, the packet MUST 
   NOT be forwarded but processed as defined in [1]. 
         
   The reflected traffic SHOULD NOT be included in the transmission 
   interval calculation by the source. In other words, the source 
   SHOULD NOT consider reflected packets as part of its own control 
   data bandwidth allowance. However, they MUST be processed by the 
   source and the average RTCP packet size, RTCP transmission rate, and 
   RTCP statistics must be calculated.  The algorithm for computing the 
   allowance is explained in Section 9.  
       
   If an application wishes to use APP packets, it is recommended that 
   the simple feedback model be used since it is likely that all 
   receivers in the session will need to hear the APP-specific packets. 
   The same applies for all other RTCP packets that are not defined in 
   the base RTP specification [1]. The decision to use the simple 
   feedback model MUST be made in advance of the session and MUST be 
   indicated in the SDP announcement [5]. 
    
    
6.3 Receiver behaviour 
    
   Receivers listen on the RTP channel for data and the RTCP channel 
   for control. Each receiver calculates its share of the control 
   bandwidth R/n, based on the standard rule that a fraction of the 
   RTCP bandwidth, R, allocated to receivers is divided equally between 
   the number of unique receiver SSRCs in the session, n. See Section 9 
   for further information on the calculation of the bandwidth 
   allowance. When a receiver is eligible to transmit, it sends a 
   unicast Receiver Report packet to the RTCP port of the distribution 
   source.

7. Sender feedback summary model 

   In the sender feedback summary model, the Distribution Source is 
   required to summarise the information received from all the Receiver 
   Reports generated by the receivers and place the information into 
   summary reports. The sender feedback summary model introduces a new 
   report block format and a number of optional sub-report block 
   formats. The Receiver Summary Information report (RSI) is required 
   and MUST be sent by a source if the summarised feedback mechanism is 
   selected. Transmission of sub-report types is OPTIONAL.  They MAY be 
   appended to the RSI report block to provide more detailed 
   information on the overall session characteristics reported by all 
   receivers and also to convey important information such as the 
   feedback address and reporting bandwidth. 
 
   From an RTP perspective, the Distribution Source acts like an RTP 
   receiver but it is not counted in the receiver bandwidth allocation 
   (as it summarizes information provided by the other receivers); 
   nevertheless, the Distribution Source's transmission rate MUST 
   adhere to RTCP bandwidth limitations for receivers. Any 
   summarization data MUST be appended to a Receiver Report (RR) packet 
   generated by the distribution source and forwarded to the receiver 
   group. If the distribution source is actually an RTP sender, even if 
   it is the only session sender, it MUST also generate Sender Report 
   (SR) packets. 
    
   The Distribution Source MUST use an SSRC value for transmitting 
   summarization information and MUST perform proper SSRC collision 
   detection and resolution. 
    
        Editor's note: Here, we can also optimize for the common case 
        (Distribution Source == sender) and reduce the forward bit 
        rate.  However, the generalized way always requiring the 
        Distribution Source to be a receiver with its own SSRC appears 
        to be much cleaner; but this comes at the cost of some extra 
        bit rate. 
    
   The Distribution Source MUST send at least one Receiver Summary 
   Information packet for each reporting interval.  The distribution 
   source can additionally stack sub-report blocks after the RSI 
   packet. Each sub-report block corresponds to the initial RSI packet 
   and acts as an enhancement to the basic summary information required 
   by the receivers to calculate their reporting time interval. For 
   this reason, additional sub-report blocks are not required but 
   recommended. RSI and the corresponding sub-report blocks are sent in 
   addition to the standard receiver-issued packets, such as Receiver 
   Reports and SDES packets outlined in [1].

   The RSI packet includes the following fields: 
 
   length: 16 bits 
      As defined in [1], the length of the RTCP packet in 32-bit words 
      minus one, including the header and any padding. 
 
   SSRC: 32 bits 
      The SSRC of the distribution source. 
    
   Timestamp: 64 bits 
      Indicates the wallclock time, which is seconds relative to 0h UTC 
      on 1 January 1900, when this report was sent.  This value is used 
      to enable detection of duplicate packets, reordering and to 
      provide a chronological profile of the feedback reports. 
    
   Group size: 32 bits 
      This field provides the sender's view of the number of receivers 
      in a session. This MUST include the sender itself and any other 
      senders potentially connected to the session, e.g., via a 
      mixer/translator gateway. The group size is calculated according 
      to the rules outlined in [1]. 
      The group size field MAY be left empty (indicated by a value of 
      0); if so, the RTCP Bandwidth report block MUST be present to 
      indicate the per-receiver RTCP bandwidth. 
 
 
7.1.2 Optional Sub-Report Block Types 
   
   For RSI reports, this document also introduces a sub-report block 
   format specific to the RSI packet. The sub-report blocks are 
   appended to the RSI packet using the following generic format.  All 
   sub-report blocks MUST be 32-bit aligned.

      Sub-Report Block Type. The sub-report block type identifier.  The 
      values for the sub-report block types are defined in section 5. 
    
   Length: 8 bits 
      The length of the sub-report in 32-bit words. 
 
   SRBT-specific data: <Length*4 - 2> octets

      SRBT value. 
    
    
 7.1.3 Generic Sub-Report Block Fields 
    
   For the sub-report blocks that convey distributions of values (Loss, 
   Jitter, RTT, Cumulative Loss), a flexible 'data bucket' style report 
   is used. This divides the data set into variable size buckets that 
   are interpreted according to the guide fields at the head of the 
   report block.

   The SRBT and Length fields are calculated as explained in section 
   7.1.2. 
    
   Number of distribution buckets (NDB): 12 bits 
      The number of distribution buckets of data. The size of the 
      bucket can be calculated using the formula ((length * 4) - 
      12)*8/NDB number of bits. The calculation is based upon the 
      length of the whole sub-report block in octets (length field * 4) 
      minus the header of 12 octets. Providing 12 bits for the NDB 
      field enables bucket sizes as small as 2 bits for a full length 
      packet of MTU 1500 bytes. The bucket size in bits must always be 
      divisible by 2 to ensure proper byte alignment. A bucket size of

      2 bits is fairly restrictive, however, and it is expected that 
      larger bucket sizes will be more practical for most 
      distributions. 
    
   Multiplicative Factor (MF): 4 bits 
      MF+1 indicates the multiplicative factor to be applied to each 
      distribution bucket value.  Possible values are 0 - 15, 
      indicating multiplicative factors of 1 - 16.  
    
   Length: 8 bits 
      The length field tells the receiver the full length of the sub-
      report block in 32-bit words (i.e. length * 4 bytes), and enables 
      the receiver to identify the bucket size. For example, given no 
      MTU restrictions, the data portion of a distribution packet may 
      be only as large as 1008 bytes (255 * 4 - 12), providing up to 
      4032 data buckets of length 2 bits, or 2016 data buckets of 
      length 4 bits etc... 
    
   Minimum distribution value (min): 32 bits 
      The minimum distribution value, in combination with the maximum 
      distribution value, indicates the range covered by the data 
      bucket values. 
    
   Maximum distribution value (max): 32 bits 
      The maximum distribution value, in combination with the minimum 
      distribution value, indicates the range covered by the data 
      bucket values. The significance and range of the distribution 
      values is defined in the individual profiles for each 
      distribution type (DT). 
    
   Distribution buckets: each bucket is ((length * 4) - 12)*8/NDB bits 
      The size and number of buckets is calculated as outlined above 
      based upon the value of NDB and the length of the packet. The 
      values for distribution buckets are equally distributed; 
      according to the following formula, distribution bucket x (with 0 
      <= x < NDB) covering the value range: 
    
             [ min+(max-min)/NDB*x ; min+(max-min)/NDB*(x+1) ] 
    
   Interpretation of the minimum, maximum and distribution values in 
   the sub-report block are profile-specific and are addressed 
   individually in the sections below. The size of the sub-report block 
   is variable, as indicated by the packet length field. 
    
    
 7.1.4 Loss sub-report block 
   
   The loss sub-report block allows a receiver to determine how its own 
   reception quality relates to the other recipients.  A receiver may 
   use this information, e.g. to drop out of a session (instead of 
   sending lots of error repair feedback) if it finds itself isolated 
   at the lower end of the reception quality scale.

   The loss sub-report block indicates the distribution of losses as 
   reported by the receivers to the distribution source. Values are 
   expressed as a fixed-point number with the binary point at the left 
   edge of the field similar to the "fraction lost" field in SR and RR 
   packets as defined in [1]. The sub-report block type (SRBT) is 4. 
    
   Valid results for the minimum distribution value field are 0 - 254. 
   Similarly, valid results for the maximum distribution value field 
   are 1 - 255. The minimum distribution value MUST always be less than 
   the maximum. 
    
   For examples on processing summarised loss report sub-blocks, see 
   the Appendix. 
    
    
  7.1.5 Jitter sub-report block 
   
   A jitter sub-report block indicates the distribution of the 
   estimated statistical variance of the RTP data packet interarrival 
   time reported by the receivers to the distribution source. This 
   allows receivers both to place their own observed jitter values in 
   context with the rest of the group, and to approximate dynamic 
   parameters for playout buffers. See [1] for details on how the 
   values are calculated and the relevance of the jitter results. 
   Jitter values are measured in timestamp units and expressed as 
   unsigned integers. The minimum distribution value must alw
