              Controller Identification Extension for MUD
             draft-lear-opsawg-mud-controller-candidates-00

Abstract

   Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUD) are a means by which devices
   can establish expectations about how they are intended to behave, and
   how the network should treat them.  This extension provides a means
   for a MUD controller to identify itself through its own MUD file.

1.  Introduction

   Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUD) [RFC8520] provides a means for
   devices to identify what they are and what sort of network access
   they need.  Two abstractions made available in that specification are
   "controller" and "my-controller".  As initially specified, these
   devices must be identfied by the network administrator.  To simplify
   the administrator's life, a means of identifying devices that are
   candidates to be a controller for another device is desirable.

   This memo specifies an extension that makes use of the MUD file of
   the controller itself.  It also sets the groundwork to create a
   RESTful interface for applications that are serving as controllers to
   make use of the same grouping.  However, that work is left either for
   a future version of this draft, or a future specification.

   For example, a light switch might identify as a candidate controller
   for luminaires.  A thermostat might identify as a controller for an
   air conditioner or heater.

   To address the case where "my-controller" is used, the manufacturer
   of a candidate controller must list the MUD URLs of devices that it
   knows it can serve.  For example, if thermostat manufacturer "Example
   Thermostat, Inc" knows that it can properly control a heater made by
   "Example Heating, Inc", and the heater has a mud url of
   "https://heating.example.com/mudurls/heater1000.json", the thermostat
   would list that or an expression matching that URL in its MUD URL.
   The heater's MUD file would be expected to contain a "my-controller"
   statement in order for this controller to be considered a candidate.

   To address the case where "controller" is used, then the class
   indicated by the controller must be named instead of a MUD URL.  In
   our previous example, let us assume that the heater1000.json file
   contains a "controller" statement with a class URI of
   "https://heating.example.com/theromstats".  In this case, the

   controller would contain a statement that indicates it can be a
   controller for class "https://heating.example.com".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The ietf-mud-controller model extension

   We now formally define this extension.  This is done in two parts.
   First, the extension name "controller-candidate" is listed in the
   "extensions" array of the MUD file.

   Second, the "mud" container is augmented to contain two optional
   lists, one that contains mud-urls that can be matched for "my-
   controller", and a second list that contains classes that can be
   matched against "controller".

   This is done as follows.

   module: ietf-mud-controller-candidate
     augment /mud:mud:
         +--rw controller-candidates
             +--rw urls*      inet:uri
             +--rw classes*   inet:uri

   TBD

4.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations of [RFC8520] apply equally to this
   extension.  In addition, some care should be given to claims that a
   device is permitted to be a controller in any given circumstances.
   Complete automation requires far more context than is currently
   specified here.  Some form of confirmation or selection is required
   by an administrator.  This memo simply makes it easier for
   administrator to identify candidates for controller selection.

   IANA Considerations ===================

   The IANA is requested to add "controller-candidate" to the MUD
   extensions registry as follows:

     Extension Name: controller-candidate
     Standard reference: This document
