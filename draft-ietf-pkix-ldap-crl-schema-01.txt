ABSTRACT

This document describes an LDAP schema for X.509 CRLs. Each CRL is broken down 
into a set of attribute types. These attributes can then be stored in a CRL 
entry, or set of entries. Object classes are defined for these CRL entries. Each 
attribute type uses an existing LDAP syntax, so that no new matching rules need 
to be defined. 

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and  "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

1. Introduction

It currently isn't possible to search LDAP servers for X.509 [6] attributes 
(public key certificates, CRLs etc.) as no matching rules have been defined for 
them. A couple of Internet Drafts [9,10] have been specified, but implementation 
of them is complex. 

This document takes an alternative approach. Rather than search for an X.509 
attribute in an entry, it suggests the directory user creates an entry (in the 
case of pubic key and attribute certificates) or a subtree (in the case of CRLs) 
from the X.509 attribute. The attributes of these new entries will be created 
from fields of the X.509 attribute (e.g. the issuer field), and if these new 
attributes are defined using existing LDAP syntaxes and matching rules, then it 
will be possible to use existing LDAP server technology to search for fields in 
X.509 attributes.

This document is one of a set comprising:
i)	the LDAP schema for X.509 public key certificates [7]
ii)	the LDAP schema for X.509 attribute certificates [8]
iii)	the LDAP schema for X.509 CRLs (this document)

Schema definitions are provided using LDAPv3 description formats from RFC2252 
[3].  Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped) for readability.
The specifications use the augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) as described in 
RFC2234 [4]. 

2. DIT Structure and Naming

If the schema presented in this document is used to store information about CRLs 
in a directory, each CRL entry SHOULD be stored as a direct subordinate of the 
CRL issuer's entry, unless a crlScope Extension or issuingDistributionPoint 
Extension is present in the CRL. In the latter cases the CRL MUST be stored as 
indicated in those extensions.  The CRL entry is named using the 
x509crlThisUpdate attribute, using one of the following name forms:

   (1.2.826.0.1.3344810.1.3.0
        NAME 'x509CRLNameForm'
        OC x509CRL
        MUST x509crlThisUpdate )

   (1.2.826.0.1.3344810.1.3.7
        NAME 'x509ARLNameForm'
        OC x509CRL
        MUST x509crlThisUpdate )

   (1.2.826.0.1.3344810.1.3.8
        NAME 'x509deltaRLNameForm'
        OC x509CRL
        MUST x509crlThisUpdate )

x509CRLNameForm is used to name CRL entries.
x509ARLNameForm is used to name Authority Revocation List entries.
x509deltaRLNameForm is used to name delta CRL entries.

Subordinate to the entry for the CRL, the user MAY create an entry for each 
revoked certificate. Each revoked certificate entry is named with the serial 
number of the revoked certificate, unless the CRL is an indirect CRL, in which 
case it named with a combination of the serial number and issuer's DN i.e. a 
multi-valued RDN. For those LDAP servers that do not support multi-valued RDNs, 
and alternative name form is defined in which the serial number and issuer DN 
are concatenated together into one attribute value. This is expressed in the 
following name forms:

   (1.2.826.0.1.3344810.1.3.1
        NAME 'x509CRLentryNameForm'
        OC x509CRLentry
        MUST x509serial )

   (1.2.826.0.1.3344810.1.3.2
        NAME 'x509CRLindirectEntryNameForm'
        OC x509CRLentry
        MUST ( x509serialNumber $ x509issuer ) )

   (1.2.826.0.1.3344810.1.3.6
        NAME 'x509CRLindirectEntryAltNameForm'
        OC x509AC
        MUST ( x509issuerSerial ) )

   	SUBSTR caseIgnoreIA5SubstringsMatch
   	SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26 )

Values of this attribute type must be stored in the syntax given in Appendix B

8.2.6 Certificate Issuer registered ID

   	EQUALITY objectIdentifierMatch
   	SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38 )

registeredID is an identifier of any registered object assigned in accordance 
with ITU-T Rec. X.660. [17]

8.3 Revocation Reason Code

This field may be used to hold the coded reason for the revocation

   (1.2.826.0.1.3344810.1.1.47
   	NAME 'x509crlCertReasonCode'
   	DESC 'An integer code indicating the reason for the revocation, see

   	EQUALITY integerMatch
      ORDERING integerOrderingMatch
   	SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27 )

8.4 Hold Instruction Code

This attribute may be used to store the hold instruction code for the 
certificate on the CRL.

   (1.2.826.0.1.3344810.1.1.103
   	NAME 'x509crlCertHoldInstructionCode'
   	DESC 'Any registered OID indicating a hold instruction, see
   	      RFC3280 5.3.2'
   	EQUALITY objectIdentifierMatch
   	SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38 )

Security Considerations

This [Internet Draft/Standard] describes the subschema for the storage
and matching of PKI attributes derived from CRLs. It does not address the 
protocol for the storage and retrieval of this information.

LDAP servers SHOULD use authentication and access control mechanisms to protect 
the information during its storage and retrieval.
