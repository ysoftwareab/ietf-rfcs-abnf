1.  Introduction

   This document defines XREL, a data format for describing extended
   hypermedia relationships identified by Uniform Resource Locators.

   This document registers a media-type identifier with the IANA:
   "application/xrel".  This registration is for community review and
   will be submitted to the IESG for review, approval, and registration
   with IANA.

1.1.1.  Terminology and Conformance Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.1.2.  General

   Representational State Transfer, or *REST*, is an architectural style
   for distributed hypermedia systems.  Introduced and first defined in
   2000 in Chapter 5, REST, of the doctoral dissertation "Architectural
   Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architecture" by Roy
   Fielding.

   *Hypermedia*, or hypertext, is defined by the presence of application
   control information embedded within, or as a layer above, the
   presentation of information.  Hypermedia allows for a virtually
   unbound network of resources while also guiding users through an
   application as they navigate said relationships.

   A *hypermedia relationship*, also known as a link relation, describes
   the semantics behind a virtual uni-directional association between
   two resources.

   A *hypermedia relationship name* is an identifier for a hypermedia
   relationship.

   A *resource* is the intended conceptual target of a hypertext
   reference.

   *Representational state* indicates the current state of the requested
   resource, the desired state for the requested resource, or the value
   of some other resource, such as a representation of the input data
   within a client's query form, or a representation of some error
   condition for a response.

   *Application state* is the state of the user's application of
   computing to a given task, controlled and stored by the user agent
   and can be composed of representations from multiple servers.

   This document and the specification documented in it are heavily
   influenced by the RAML 1.0 Spec [RAML].

1.1.3.  Documents description

   A trailing question mark, for example *description?*, indicates an
   optional property.

   Throughout this specification, *markdown* means GitHub-Flavored
   Markdown [github.md].  Tooling MAY choose to ignore some Markdown
   features to address security concerns.

1.2.  Motivation

   The Uniform Interface constraint of the REST architectural style
   dictates that hypermedia be the engine of application state.  This
   means that the state of the application and its potential transitions
   are dictated by the presence of hypermedia relationships in-band and
   by the navigation of those relationships by an user (human or
   automated).  In order for users to evaluate and select the
   appropriate relationships to navigate they must rely on an out-band
   understanding of relationships by their names.

   While humans can derive meaning from relationship names in natural
   language, automated agents have relied on a central repository of
   standard names maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
   (IANA).  Instead of creating and registering entirely new link
   relations (i.e. "patient", "appointment", "schedulingService", etc.)
   with a central repository, authors can choose to create an XREL
   document; one that explains the vital, perhaps domain-specific,
   semantics of the relationship and which is identified by an URL
   controlled by the author.

   This decentralization allows for a much lower entry barrier, which is
   not inconsistent with the general concept of the web, and enables
   different use cases.  For example, a private organization is fully
   capable of defining their own repository of XREL definitions outside
   of the open Internet, after all standards are a byproduct of
   authority.  Conversely, public XREL definitions would allow for
   serendipitous reuse, where useful relationships backed by stable URLs
   might be discovered and possibly become de facto standard.

2.  XREL Documents

2.1.  Format

   Following RAML conventions, XREL documents are YAML documents.  The
   file extension ".yaml" SHALL be used to designate files containing
   XREL documents.





Montoya                  Expires August 30, 2019                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                    xrel                     February 2019


   This specification uses YAML 1.2 [W3C.yaml] as its underlying format.
   YAML is a human-readable data format that aligns well with the design
   goals of this specification.  As in YAML, all nodes such as keys,
   values, and tags, are case-sensitive.

   To facilitate the automated processing of XREL documents, XREL
   imposes the following restrictions and requirements in addition to
   the core YAML 1.2 specification:

   o  The first line of a XREL file consists of a YAML comment that
      specifies the XREL version and document type.  Therefore, XREL
      processors cannot completely ignore all YAML comments.

2.2.  Relationship Object

   Explains the semantics of a hypermedia relationship.

2.2.1.  Properties

   +-------------+--------+--------------------------------------------+
   | Name        |  Type  | Description                                |
   +-------------+--------+--------------------------------------------+
   | description | string | Describes the semantics of a hypermedia    |
   |             |        | relationship. The semantics SHOULD         |
   |             |        | describe the relationship of the target    |
   |             |        | resource to the context resource, and not  |
   |             |        | any particular representation formats.     |
   |             |        | Markdown MAY be used for rich text         |
   |             |        | representation.                            |
   +-------------+--------+--------------------------------------------+

2.3.  XREL Document

   Defines a single Relationship Object.

   The first line of a XREL document MUST begin with the text "#%XREL
   1.0" followed by nothing but the end of the line.

2.3.1.  Document Example

#%XREL 1.0

description: Refers to an event scheduling service resource related to the context resource.

Internet-Draft                    xrel                     February 2019


2.4.  XREL Collection Document

   Defines a map where the keys are the document scoped relationship
   names and the values are Relationship Objects.  XREL Collections can
   be used to combine any collection of Relationship Objects.

   The first line of a collection document MUST begin with the text
   "#%XREL 1.0 Collection" followed by nothing but the end of the line.

2.4.1.  Document Example

#%XREL 1.0 Collection

schedulingService:
  description: Refers to an event scheduling service resource related to the context resource.
patient:
  description: Refers to a patient resource related to the context resource.

2.5.  Identifying XREL Documents

   XREL documents are identified by unique URLs, this URL SHOULD be
   dereferenceable.

   In order to reduce load on servers responding to XREL document
   requests, it is RECOMMENDED that servers use cache control directives
   that instruct client apps to locally cache the results.  Clients
   making these XREL document requests SHOULD honor the server's caching
   directives.

2.6.  Fragment identifiers

   When applied to an XREL document, a URI fragment identifier MUST be a
   JSON Pointer [1] and be computed as such.

2.7.  Identifying XREL Relationships

   In the case of XREL Documents as specified in Section 2.3, the URL
   that identifies that document also identifies the hypermedia
   relationship described in that document.  For example, if the
   document example in Section 2.3.1 is served at
   *http://docs.example.org/xrels/shedulingService* then this URL is the
   identifier for the relationship described in that document.

   In the case of XREL Collection Documents as specified in Section 2.4,
   fragment identifiers MUST be used for the relationships objects
   described in that document.  For example, if the document example in
   Section 2.4.1 is served at *http://docs.example.org/xrels/clinical*
   then *http://docs.example.org/xrels/clinical#/shedulingService* and

Internet-Draft                    xrel                     February 2019


   *http://docs.example.org/xrels/clinical#/patient* identify the first
   and second Relationship Object, respectively.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This specification establishes the media type "application/xrel" for
   community review and will be submitted to the IESG for review,
   approval, and registration with IANA.

3.1.  application/xrel

   *Type name:* application

   *Subtype name:* xrel

   *Required parameters:* none

   *Optional parameters:*

      *profile:*: A whitespace-separated list of URIs identifying
      specific constraints or conventions that apply to an XREL
      document.  A profile must not change the semantics of the resource
      representation when processed without profile knowledge, so that
      clients both with and without knowledge of a profiled resource can
      safely use the same representation.  The profile parameter may
      also be used by clients to express their preferences in the
      content negotiation process.  It is recommended that profile URIs
      are dereferenceable and provide useful documentation at that URI.

   *Encoding considerations:*

      *binary:* Because of YAML's relation to JSON the same encoding
      considerations of application/json as specified in JavaScript
      Object Notation [RFC3986] apply.

   *Security considerations:*

      Because of YAML's relation to JSON this format shares security
      issues common to all JSON content types.  The security issues of
      JavaScript Object Notation [RFC3986], section 6, should be
      considered.

   *Interoperability considerations:* none

   *Fragment identifier considerations:*

      Fragment identifiers are to be computed as defined by the JSON
      Pointer [2] specification.

5.  Appendix B.  Frequently Asked Questions

5.1.  How can I submit comments or feedback to the editors?

   The issues list for this draft can be found at https://github.com/
   phtal-org/internet-draft-xrel/issues [3].  For additional
   information, see https://phtal-org.github.io/internet-draft-xrel/
   [4].

   To provide feedback, use this issue tracker, the communication
   methods listed on the homepage, or email the document editors.

5.2.  Why not include target attributes as defined by RFC8288 'Web
      Linking'?

   Link relations are universal, they describe an _association_ to a
   conceptual target and not the targets themselves nor their
   representations.  It is the responsibility of the application authors

   to communicate to their clients what data types are necessary to
   navigate a relationship and/or the data types that might be expected
   as a result.

   This level of abstraction has value because it's easier to
   standardize representations (HTML Microformats, RAML data types,
   etc.) and link relations than it is to standardize objects and
   object-specific interfaces.  Application servers are free to combine
   representations and link relations in any way they wish and to
   provide them in any order, all while remaining understandable to the
   client.
