Abstract

   OPEN-O(Orchestrator) Project was presented for the first time during
   Open Network Summit 2016 in Santa Clara. The purpose of OPEN-O would
   intent to propose an open source project under Linux foundation. It
   includes cross domain orchestrator, SDN-O and NFV-O. SDN-O is
   sitting on top of SDN Controller like ODL or ONOS and somewhere
   below the SDN APP. NFVO is aligned with ETSI NFV ISG. This document
   is seeking for the relationship between open standard IETF and open
   source project OPEN-O.

1. Introduction

   OPEN-O(Orchestrator) Project was presented for the first time during
   Open Network Summit 2016 in Santa Clara. The OPEN-O would intent to
   propose an open source project under Linux foundation, and it is
   targeting to orchestrator legacy network, SDN overlay network, and
   NFV virtualized network. It also works with other network related
   open source project like OPNFV, ODL, ONOS and Openstack and try to
   interwork with them or be integrated. Many working groups such as
   OPS Area, SDNRG, NFVRG in IETF or IRTF are related to OPEN-O's work.
   So OPEN-O as the open source project would like to work with open
   standard body like IETF.



2. OPEN-O architecture

   OPEN-O architecture which was presented in ONS 2016 includes cross
   domain orchestrator, SDN-O and NFV-O. SDN-O is sitting on top of SDN

   Forwarding Graph),



4. Relationship with NFVRG

   OPEN-O will include NFVO as part of the architecture, some topics
   will be related to NFVRG research work in the future.



5. Relationship with SDNRG

   OPEN-O is going to work with north bound interface of SDN controller
   like ODL, ONOS et al.
