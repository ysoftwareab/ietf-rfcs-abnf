                 Distributed NFV in Scattered Premises
                  draft-geng-nfvrg-distributed-nfv-00

Abstract

   This document introduces the distributed NFV (D-NFV) concept based on
   potential implementation in scattered locations including customer
   edge devices and transport network equipments.  The motivation of
   pushing NFV entities from conventional centralized infrastructures to
   distributed promises is discussed, which are driven by the
   requirements of high flexibility, low end-to-end latency and faster
   time-to-market in future network.  To better understand the D-NFV
   concept, examples of D-NFV implementation is introduced.  Potential
   use cases are also described as references for readers.  Gaps have
   also been recognized in the documents in terms of the investigation
   of appropriate virtualization technologies used in the D-NFV and
   corresponding management and orchestration challenges.

1.  Introduction

   As new services such as IoT start to emerge, service provider's
   network is required to have higher flexibility, greater security and
   reliable service quality guarantee from customer end to service
   provider core.  NFV technology has been proved to be an excellent
   candidate to fulfil these demands for future network.  And it has
   been widely investigated in centralized premises including data
   centre and mobile core network applications.  To further improve
   overall system flexibility and performance, it is also extremely

   interesting to explore how NFV technology can be implemented in
   scattered network premises.

   NFV make use of the virtualization technology to decouple software
   functions from hardware infrastructures.  There is no fundamental
   limitations on where NFV can be applied to.  Some network functions
   in principle are most efficient when hosted in distributed premises.
   In this case, it is worth to consider how these functions can be
   virtualized locally to maintain their efficiency whilst benefit from
   the flexibility, fast time-to-market deployment and new business
   model such as VNPaaS that NFV can offer.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The terminology and abbreviations used in this document are defined
   in this section.

   o  D-NFV: Distributed NFV.  A system architecture where the NFV
      entities are distributively implemented in scattered network
      premises.

   o  NFVI-PoPs: NFV infrastructure points of presence.  The location
      where network functions are realized by VNFs.

4.  NFV in Different Points of Presence

   In general, NFV provides decoupled software and hardware for vendor-
   specific network elements.  Based on this principle, VNFs are allowed
   to be located anywhere as long as the corresponding infrastructures
   support.  According to ETSI, proposed points of presence for NFV
   include customers' premises, central offices, data centres and etc.
   In principle, VNFs should be placed where they are most cost-
   effective, providing better efficiency and performances .

4.1.  Centralized NFV

   At present, most of the NFV deployments are centralized.  As an
   example, the evolving mobile core network is one of the most popular
   areas where centralized NFV deployment most likely to take place in
   the near future.  It is accelerating its pace in the process of the
   transition to the next generation NFV-based architecture for 5G.  In
   fact, most of the network functions in core network in form of

   conventional vendor-specific network elements are intrinsically
   centralized.  Naturally, the virtualized entities of these network
   functions are expected to follow the centralized architecture.

                                 Figure 1

   Figure 1 illustrates the scheme diagram of a centralized NFV
   deployment.  In centralized NFV, conventional vendor-specific network
   elements are realized as VNFs which reside in centralized NFVI-PoPs
   (i.e. private telecommunication clouds).

   The computing and storage hardware resources in the centralized NFV
   are commonly in the form of server clusters.  They are normally
   pooled and usually span across different physical locations.  Network
   hardware resources (i.e. switches, routers) are essential in
   centralized NFV to provide connectivities.  These include
   connectivities within and between NFVI-PoPs.  Given the powerful
   computing and storage resources benefited from clusters, centralized
   NFV is capable of supporting the virtualization of many complex
   network elements.  The COTS used in NFVI also guarantees the system
   scalability and elastic deployment.

4.2.  Distributed NFV

   Centralization is not an intrinsic nature of NFV.  Many vendor-
   specific network elements located in scattered premises may also
   benefit from the implementation of NFV by decoupling software and
   hardware.  Service providers used to replace these equipments or make
   a full system upgrade on them to deploy new functions and services.
   With the implementation of NFV, service providers can push new
   functions and services directly corresponding network elements and
   end users respectively simply by the deployment of new VNFs.

   Many services need local processing provided by network functions are
   implemented in distributed network elements.  These network
   functions, when virtualized, still make sense to be hosted at the
   same location for many reasons.  Some examples are given as follows.

   o  Security.  Service requiring end-to-end security has to be
      implemented from the customer end.  VNF for such purposes, i.e.
      encryption are preferred to be hosted locally.

   o  Latency.  Mission critical services are very sensitive to latency.
      Local precessing is preferred to minimize the round trip latency.

   o  Resilience.  In some scenarios where services are provided
      remotely in the cloud, customers want their internal networks and
      services to keep working when there is a network failure.  Locally
      hosted VNFs can work as backups for this purpose.

   D-NFV focuses on the scenarios where the NFVI-PoPs locate in
   scattered premises.  Common infrastructures seen in these premises
   include but are not limited to end-user devices, customer premises
   equipment and dedicated network equipments in transport and bearer
   networks.

   Figure 2 illustrates the scheme diagram of a D-NFV deployment in
   customer premises.  Instead of nested with integrated software and
   hardware, the CPE provides NFVI for various VNFs.  Since the VNFs are
   decoupled with the hardware resources, service provider can
   dynamically deploy corresponding VNFs according to performance and
   customer requirements.

   The hardware resources in scattered premises are normally different
   from that in centralized data centres.  Typical examples include SoCs
   and individual servers.  Given the fact that these infrastructures
   are not designed to be clustered, the network hardware between NFVI-
   PoPs of D-NFV is not as essential as that of centralized scenario.
   However, specific services may require network connectivity between
   NFVI-PoPs to achieve better performances.  Network connectivity
   within NFVI-PoPs in D-NFV may be required depending on the actual
   design of the VNF entities.Given the limited computing and storage
   resources, VNFs in the D-NFV should be normally much less resource-
   hungry than those in centralized NFV.

5.  Typical NFVI-PoPs in Distributed NFV

   D-NFV focuses on NFV implementations in scattered locations.  This
   section introduces 2 typical examples of NFVI-PoPs including customer
   edge devices and transport network equipments.

5.1.  Distributed NFV in Customer Edge Devices

   A customer edge device is the first service-provider-owned device for
   an end-user to connect to the network and subscribe to specific
   services.  This device is normally purchased by service providers
   with required functionalities.  Accordingly, it normally has well-
   defined hardware and vendor-specific software.

   In residential network, customer edge devices are typically in forms
   of WiFi routers, with various uplink interface including PON, xDSL
   and cellular.  Service providers used to provide only internet access
   to residential users and the customer edge devices were rather
   simple.  Recently, many service provider started to provide value-
   added services such as IPTV, VoIP, home storage, remote download and
   VPNs.  Accordingly, the concept of "intelligent home gateway" is
   introduced, which enables the residential customer edge device to
   dynamically implement new services by downloading applications.
   These application are normally realized as C and Java modules.  D-NFV
   is another way to provide application and hardware decoupling, with
   extra benefits of better isolation between applications, improved
   service security, high reliability, managed resource allocation and
   comprehensive device capability exposure.  As IoT services start to
   emerge in residential market, D-NFV can improve overall deployment

Internet-Draft               Distributed NFV                  March 2017


   flexibility and generate potential new business model by providing
   guaranteed isolation, resources and deep capability exposure for
   different value-added service providers

   Other example of customer edge devices include enterprise premise and
   industrial premise equipment.  There are plenty of services which
   require local implementation and flexible deployment for optimized
   performance.  For example, WAN acceleration and firewalls have best
   efficiency when they are implemented locally.  Meanwhile, low latency
   services such as manufacture plant control and item tracking in
   industrial network also require extremely high reliability which need
   dedicatedly allocated hardware and network resources.

5.2.  Distributed NFV in Service Provider Transport and Bearer Networks

   The application of NFV in service provider transport network has been
   investigated mostly in combination of SDN technology.  It is
   interesting to see that NFV as a technology is applied to transport
   network as a way of implementing the separated control plane in
   centralized infrastructure.  This can be seen as a coordination of
   SDN and NFV technology with the control plane decoupled and
   virtualized.

   Indeed, as a data plane network equipment, current virtualization
   technologies are not efficient enough to provide data forwarding
   performance comparable to network processing chips used in these
   devices.  However, it is attractive to use NFV technology in these
   network equipment to provide isolated management and control plane.
   There is great potential for service providers to exploit this
   technology for a much more flexible management and control model for
   data plane equipments at a sliced granularity.

6.  Use cases of Distributed NFV

   In this version, several use cases are listed for general references.
   Descriptions in detail are subjected to be added according to initial
   discussion in the group.  The author would also like to call for more
   use cases for D-NFV identified by the community.

6.1.  Use Case 1 - VNFaaS and VNPaaS in Residential and Enterprise
      Network

6.2.  Use Case 2 - Mission Critical Services

Internet-Draft               Distributed NFV                  March 2017


6.3.  Use Case 3 - End-to-end Network Slicing Management

6.4.  Use Case 4 - Managed Multiple Provisioning for Network Elements

6.5.  Use Case 5 - Elastic VPN

7.  Rethinking VNFs in Distributed NFV

   In centralized NFV, VNFs are normally virtualized forms of
   conventional network elements.  Sometimes, the network function of a
   network element may be broken into multiple VNFs for specific
   implementation considerations.  In D-NFVs, VNFs are typically not a
   full representation of any existing network element.  They are more
   like applications or new services that are pushed to the customer or
   equipments.

   As distributed NFVI-PoP are normally limited in hardware resources,
   VNFs with complex functionalities are not recommended in these
   infrastructures.  Meanwhile, as VNFs in D-NFV are subjected to be
   application-specific, it is expected that the variety of VNFs in
   D-NFV will proportionally grow with the number of services provided
   through the network.  Hence, these VNFs need to have fast time-to-
   market and adapt to practices like DevOps.

8.  Virtualization Technologies in Distributed NFV

   The D-NFV may need to consider various virtulization technologies
   that are different from centralized NFV, as VNFs in D-NFV are
   expected in much smaller granularities.  In this case, container-
   based virtualization technology may be preferred.  This is also due
   to the potential large number of VNFs and limited hardware resources
   provided in distributed NFVI-PoPs.  Further studies need to be
   carried out to investigate the appropriated virtualization
   technologies used in different scenarios of D-NFV

9.  Management and Orchestration of Distributed NFV

   The management and orchestration of D-NFV need to consider the
   following difference compared with that of centralized NFV.

   o  Individually located NFVI and VIM - The nature of D-NFV decide the
      scattered locations of NFVI-PoPs.  In addition, the limited
      hardware resources are unlikely to support a full MANO
      implementation in distributed NFVI-PoPs and this is simply not
      cost-efficient and makes the overall system complicated.  Hence a
      centralized MANO is expected as a feasible solution.  This
      introduce a rather diverted model for the virtualization layer

Internet-Draft               Distributed NFV                  March 2017


      management where the VIM and NFVI will locate in centralized and
      distributed infrastructure respectively.

   o  Massive number of NFVI-PoPs and VNFs - Distributed NFVI-PoPs have
      a large number in quantity.  Taking the residential NFVI-PoP as an
      example, the number is expected to be millions for a service
      provide with a fair size business.  This does not count the
      potential industrial and IoT applications which introduce even
      more.  The number of VNFs need to be provisioned can be easily
      10-100 times of the NFVI-PoPs.  The traditional MANO intrinsically
      designed for data center applications simply does not fit.  It is
      also too heavy for this purpose - D-NFV may not need such
      comprehensive resource and network provisioning.  The management
      and orchestration for D-NFV needs to be redesigned.
