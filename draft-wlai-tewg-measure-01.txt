Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    May 2001


   This document describes a framework for Internet traffic engineering
   measurement, with the objective of providing principles for the
   development of a set of measurement systems to support the traffic
   engineering of IP-based networks [1].  A major goal is to provide
   guidance for establishing protocol-independent and platform-neutral
   traffic measurement standards to achieve multi-vendor inter-
   operability.  It is critical to minimize the possibilities of
   inconsistencies arising from, e.g., overlapping data collecting and
   processing at various protocol levels, due to the use of different
   measurement principles by different vendors or network operators.

   The initial scope is limited to those aspects of measurement
   pertaining to intra-domain, i.e., within a given autonomous system
   as well as on its boundary with other domains.  The focus is
   primarily on traffic engineering in Internet service provider
   environments.

   In this document, the use of traffic measurement in traffic
   characterization, network monitoring, and traffic control is first
   described.  Depending on the network operations to be performed in
   these tasks, three different time scales can be identified, ranging
   from months, through days or hours, to minutes or less.  To support
   these operations, traffic measurement must be able to capture
   accurately, within a given confidence interval, the traffic
   variations and peaks without degrading network performance and
   without generating an immense amount of data.  Therefore,
   specification of a suitable read-out period for each service class
   for traffic summarization is essential.

   Traffic measurement can be performed on the basis of flows,
   interfaces, links, nodes, node-pairs, or paths.  Based on these
   objects, different measurement entities can be defined, such as
   traffic volume, average holding time, bandwidth availability,
   throughput, delay, delay variation, packet loss, and resource usage.
   Using these measured traffic data, in conjunction with other network
   data such as topological data and router configuration data, traffic
   matrix and other relevant statistics can be derived for traffic
   engineering purposes.  Traffic measurement also plays a key role in
   network performance management.

   As a framework, this document is mainly concerned with a discussion
   of various technical issues surrounding traffic measurement.
   Requirements for traffic measurement are contained in the Annex.  As
   far as possible and to avoid duplication of effort, relevant work
   done in this area by other standards organizations will be applied
   or adapted, and references to them will be made.  These include, in
   particular,

   . IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group of the IETF: its
     framework document [2] and documents on individual metrics
     [references to be added]

     Y.1541 [4]

4. Terminology

   The intent of this section is not to provide definition or
   description of terms used in this document.  Rather, it is to
   highlight the difference in usage of related terms.

   Path, route

   A path refers to an MPLS tunnel, i.e., a label-switched path.  A
   route is any unidirectional sequence of nodes and links, for sending
   packets from a source node to a destination node.  (Note: There are
   also methods for creating paths with other technologies such as
   frame-relay or ATM.  Applicability of the measurement described in
   this document to these technologies is to be covered in the next
   version of this document.)

   Throughput, traffic volume

   Both quantities can be applied to a network, a network segment, or
   an individual network element.  Throughput of a network, as a
   measure of delivered performance, refers to the maximum sustainable
   rate of transferring packets successfully across the network, under
   given network conditions (e.g., a given traffic mix) while meeting
   QoS objectives.  (This is consistent with the definition of
   throughput for a network interconnect device as specified in [5].)
   For real-time network control, active measurement of throughput by
   probing may be used to determine the currently available capacity of
   a network to carry additional traffic.  Traffic volume, as a measure
   of the traffic carried, characterizes the level of traffic that a
   network is designed to support.  Passive measurement of the traffic
   volume is usually used to estimate the long-term offered traffic for
   the purposes of network dimensioning in the capacity-management and
   network-planning processes (see the Section on Time Scales for
   Network Operations).  A network should be properly dimensioned so
   that its throughput is adequate to handle the expected traffic
   volume.

   Throughput is expressed in terms of number of data units per time
   unit.  Traffic volume is expressed in data units with reference to a
   read-out period (see the Section on Read-Out Periods).  For
   transmission systems, the data unit is usually a multiple of either
   bits or bytes.  For processing systems, the data unit is usually a
   multiple of packets.

5. Uses of Traffic Measurement

   Traffic measurement is used to collect traffic data for the
   following purposes:

   Traffic characterization

   . identifying traffic patterns, particularly traffic peak patterns,
     and their variations in statistical analysis; this includes
     developing traffic profiles to capture daily, weekly, or seasonal
     variations
   . determining traffic distributions in the network on the basis of
     flows, interfaces, links, nodes, node-pairs, paths, or
     destinations
   . estimation of the traffic load according to service classes in
     different routers and the network
   . observing trends for traffic growth and forecasting of traffic
     demands


   Network monitoring

   . determining the operational state of the network, including fault
     detection
   . monitoring the continuity and quality of network services, to
     ensure that QoS/GoS objectives are met for various classes of
     traffic, to verify the performance of delivered services, or to
     serve as a means of sectionalizing performance issues seen by a
     customer (QoS reflects the performance perceivable by a user of a
     service, while GoS is used by a service provider for internal
     design and operation)
   . evaluating the effectiveness of traffic engineering policies, or
     triggering certain policy-based actions (such as alarm generation,
     or path preemption) upon threshold crossing; this may be based on
     the use of performance history data
   . verifying peering agreements between service providers by
     monitoring/measuring the traffic flows over interconnecting links
     at border routers; this includes the estimation of inter- and
     intra-network traffic, as well as originating, terminating, and
     transit traffic that are being exchanged between peers

   Traffic control

   . adaptively optimizing network performance in response to network
     events, e.g., rerouting to work around congestion or failures
   . providing a feedback mechanism in the reverse flow messaging of
     RSVP-TE or CR-LDP signaling to report on actual topology state
     information such as link bandwidth availability
   . support of measurement-based admission control, i.e., by
     predicting the future demands of the aggregate of existing flows
     so that admission decisions can be made on new flows

6. Time Scales for Network Operations

   The information collected by traffic measurement can be provided to
   the end user or application either in real time or for record in
   non-real time, depending on the activities to be performed and the
   network actions to be taken.  Traffic control will generally require
   real-time information.  For network planning and capacity management


Lai                     Category - Expiration                [Page 4]


Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    May 2001


   as described below, information may be provided in non-real time
   after the processing of raw data.

   Broadly speaking, the following three time scales can be classified,
   according to the use of observed traffic information for network
   operations [6].

   Network planning
   Information that changes on the order of months is used to make
   traffic forecasts as a basis for network extensions and long-term
   network configuration.  That is, for planning the topology of the
   network, planning alternative routes to survive failures or
   determining where capacity must be augmented in advance of projected
   traffic growth.  Forecasting and planning may also lead to the
   introduction of new technology and architecture.

   Capacity management
   Information that changes on the order of days or hours is used to
   manage the deployed facilities, by taking appropriate maintenance or
   engineering actions to optimize utilization.  For example, new MPLS
   tunnels may be set up or existing tunnels modified while meeting
   Service Level Agreements.  Also, load balancing may be performed, or
   traffic may be rerouted for re-optimization after a failure.

   Real-time network control
   Information that changes on the order of minutes or less is used to
   adapt to the current network conditions in near real time.  Thus, to
   combat localized congestion, traffic management actions may perform
   temporary rerouting to redistribute the load.  Upon detecting a
   failure, traffic may be diverted to pre-established, secondary
   routes until more optimized routes can be arranged.

7. Read-Out Periods

   A measurement infrastructure must be able to scale with the size and
   the speed of a network as it evolves.  Hence, it is important to
   minimize the amount of data to be collected, and to condense the
   collected data by periodic summarization.  This is to prevent
   network performance from being adversely affected by the
   unnecessarily excessive loading of router control processors, router
   memories, transmission facilities, and the administrative support
   systems.

   A measurement interval is the time interval over which measurements
   are taken.  Some traffic data must be collected continuously, while
   others by sampling, or on a scheduled basis.  For example, peak
   loads and peak periods can be identified only by continuous
   measurement as traffic typically fluctuates irregularly during the
   whole day.  If traffic variations are regular and predictable, it
   may be possible to measure the expected normal load on pre-
   determined portions of the day.  This requires the definition of a
   busy period.  Special studies on selected segments of the network
   may be conducted on a scheduled basis.  Active measurement, with the

Lai                     Category - Expiration                [Page 5]


Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    May 2001


   involvement of network operator, may be activated manually.  For
   instance, active throughput measurement may be used to identify
   alternate routes during periods of network congestion.

   A measurement interval consists of a sequence of consecutive read-
   out periods.  Summarization is usually done by integrating the raw
   data over a pre-specified read-out period.  The granularity of this
   period must be suitably chosen.  It should be short enough to
   capture, with acceptable accuracy, the bursty nature of the traffic,
   i.e., the traffic variations and peaks.  Since measurements
   represent a load for the router, the read-out period should not be
   so short that router performance is degraded while a voluminous
   quantity of data is produced.   Also, read-out may be started when
   the measured data exceeds a preset threshold, or when the space
   allocated for temporarily holding the data in a router is exhausted.

   For a multi-service IP-based network, each service typically has its
   own traffic characteristics and performance objectives.  To ensure
   that service-specific features are reflected in the measurement
   process, different read-out periods may be needed for different
   classes of service.

8. Measurement Bases

   Measurements can be classified on the basis of where, and at which
   level the traffic data are gathered and aggregated.  This is similar
   to the concept of a population of interest as specified in ITU-T
   Recommendation I.380/Y.1540.  As defined therein, this refers to a
   set of packets, possibly relative to a particular pair of source and
   destination hosts, for the purposes of defining performance
   parameters.  However, measurement bases as used here may not have
   any association with a source-destination pair.

   In this document, customer-based measurements are not considered.
   Service providers will make decisions on how to perform the
   measurements needed, and there are various tradeoffs involved.  One
   option is to obtain the measurements directly from the network
   elements themselves, e.g., via SNMP.  Collecting the measurements on
   the operational network elements such as routers is sometimes a
   performance concern.  Currently, there are a number of third-party
   measurement/monitoring products available.  Hence, another option is
   to deploy such equipment, which might have performance advantages
   but also introduces additional cost.

   Regardless of the type of measurement source, either a network
   element or a third-party product, measurements should be collected,
   as far as possible, by a measurement source without requiring
   coordination with other measurement sources.  Thus, it is desirable
   to perform those measurements that do not require the use of
   specialized monitoring equipment connected to the network at
   multiple locations.  While each measurement source may act
   autonomously with regard to taking measurements, a network operator
   may specify some network-wide policy regarding measurement

Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    May 2001


   scheduling.  Such policy may be, say, the use of the same time of
   day, the same measurement interval, or measurement intervals that
   are multiples of each other (e.g., nested intervals with
   synchronized boundaries).  A schedule therefore should include such
   time information as the start, the duration, and periodicity of a
   certain measurement.

   The following measurement bases are considered in this document.

   Flow-based

   This is conceptually similar to the call detail record (CDR) in
   telecommunication networks.  It is primarily used on interfaces at
   access routers, edge routers, or aggregation routers where traffic
   originates or terminates, rather than on backbone routers in the
   core network.  Like CDR measurements, flow-based records are used to
   collect detailed information about a flow.  This includes such
   information as source and destination IP addresses/port numbers,
   protocol, type of service, timestamps for the start and end of a
   flow, packet count, octet count, etc.

   As flow is a fine-grained object, measuring every flow that passes
   through all the edge devices may not be scalable or feasible.
   Hence, per-flow data are usually used in a special study conducted
   on a non-continuous schedule and on selected routers only.  Sampling
   of flow-based measurements may also be needed to reduce both the
   amount of data collected and the associated overhead.

   Interface-based, link-based, node-based

   Passive, i.e., in-service non-intrusive, measurement can be taken at
   each network element.  For example, SNMP MIBs use passive monitoring
   to collect raw data on an interface at an edge or backbone router.
   This includes data such as counts on packets and octets
   sent/received, packet discards, errored packets.  While not intended
   for core network, RMON can possibly be used in the access link of an
   ISP to provide managed Internet service to corporate LANs.
   (Consideration for link bundling in next version of this document.)

   Node-pair-based

   Active measurements by probing, as specified in the IPPM framework,
   can be conducted between each pair of major routing hubs for
   determining edge-to-edge performance of a core network.  This
   complements the passive measurements of the previous sub-section,
   which provide local views of the performance of individual network
   elements.

   In telecommunications networks, each established call has an
   associated node-pair.  By maintaining a set of node-pair data
   registers (usage, peg count, overflow, etc) in each switch, node-
   pair-based measurements for traffic statistics such as the load
   between a given node pair are taken directly.  In contrast, in IP-

Lai                     Category - Expiration                [Page 7]


Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    May 2001


   based networks, currently such kind of node-pair-based measurements
   cannot be taken directly.  However, it is possible to infer them
   from flow-based passive measurements and other network information.
   A problem with this approach is that flow-based measurement data are
   voluminous.  Also, another problem that must be accounted for is the
   routing changes among the multiple routes due to, e.g., a change in
   the configuration of intradomain routing, or a change in interdomain
   policies made by another autonomous system.  This is further
   discussed in the Section on Traffic Matrix Statistics.

   Path-based

   In this document, the term path specifically refers to MPLS tunnel,
   or label-switched path.

   The ability of MPLS to use fixed preferred paths for routing
   traffic, so-called route pinning, gives the means to develop path-
   based measurements.  This may enable the development of
   methodologies for such functions as admission control and
   performance verification of delivered service.

   Like a flow, a path is associated with a pair of nodes.  However,
   path is a more coarse-grained object than flow, as paths are usually
   used to carry aggregated traffic.  In addition, when routing changes
   occur, the amount of traffic to be carried by a path will either not
   be affected or be merged with that of another path.  Because of
   these properties, path-based measurements are more scalable and may
   be used to provide more readily an accurate, network-wide, view of
   the traffic demands.  (For example, the traffic between a given pair
   of nodes may be inferred from the aggregate of the traffic carried
   by the all the paths either terminated by or passed through the same
   node-pair.)

9. Measurement Entities

   A measurement entity defines what is measured: it is a quantity for
   which data collection must be performed with a certain measurement.
   A measurement type can be specified by a (meaningful) combination of
   a measurement entity with the measurement basis described in the
   previous section.

   Entities related to traffic and performance

   Some of the measurement entities listed below, such as throughput,
   delay, delay variation, and packet loss, are related to the IPPM
   performance metrics or the I.380/Y.1540 performance parameters.

   . Traffic volume (mean and variance for normal/high load, in bits,
     bytes, or packets transferred, as averaged over a given time
     interval), on a per service class basis, at various aggregation
     levels (IP address prefix, node, network edge, customer, or
     autonomous system)


Lai                     Category - Expiration                [Page 8]


Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    May 2001


     Note: (1) This is a measurement for the traffic carried by a
     network, a network segment, or an individual network element.
     When measured during the busy period, this entity is normally used
     to estimate the traffic offered.  However, the estimation
     procedure should take into account such factors as congestion,
     which may result in decreased carried traffic.  In addition,
     congestion may lead to user behavior such as reattempt or
     abandonment, which may affect the actual traffic offered.  (To
     include a discussion of the relevance and applicability of second-
     order statistics.) (2) Measurement of traffic volumes over
     interconnecting links at border routers can be used to estimate
     the traffic exchange between peers for contract verification.

   . Average holding time (e.g., flow duration or lifetime, duration of
     an MPLS path), on a per service class basis
     Note: Similar to call holding time in telecommunications network,
     holding time statistics are useful in network planning for sizing
     network elements.  Also, the holding time statistics of long-
     living static paths reflect the effect of network equipment
     failures, link outages, or scheduled maintenance, and hence may to
     used to derive information about up-time or service availability.

   . Available bandwidth of a link or path - useful for load balancing,
     measurement-based admission control to determine the feasibility
     of creating a new MPLS tunnel (real-time information can be used
     for dynamic establishment)

   . Throughput (in both bits (or bytes) per second and packets per
     second)
     Note:  (1) This is a measure of the "goodput."  That is, the rate
     at which a given amount of traffic excluding lost, misdelivered,
     or errored packets, passes between a set of end points, where end
     points can be logically or physically defined.  The condition of
     the network, e.g., normal or high load, under which the
     measurement is taken should be noted.  (2) The protocol level at
     which a throughput measurement is taken must be specified, as the
     packet payload and packet overheads are protocol dependent.  (3)
     The average packet size may be inferred from the bit rate and
     packet rate measurements.  This quantity is useful to gauge router
     performance, since router operations are typically packet-oriented
     and small packets are more processing-intensive.

   . Delay (e.g., cross-router delay from node-based measurement may be
     used to measure queueing delay within a router; end-to-end one-way
     or round-trip packet delay can be obtained by node-pair-based
     measurement)
     Note: The condition of the network, e.g., normal or high load,
     under which the measurement is taken should be noted.  This is
     useful to determine if delay objectives are met.

   . Delay variation
     Note: There are several ways to measure this quantity as specified
     in IPPM and I.380/Y.1540 (a brief summary to be included).

Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    May 2001



   . Packet loss
     Note:  (1) While packet losses due to transmission and/or protocol
     errors may not be traffic related, unexpected excessive loss may
     be used as a means of fault detection.  (2) Packet losses due to
     policing or network congestion should be distinguished.  The
     former is a result of user violation of service contract and the
     network operator should not be penalized for it.  The latter,
     whether intentional or unintentional, is caused by network
     conditions such as buffer overflow, router forwarding process
     busy, and may not be the user's fault.  When policing is done by a
     network, measurement of non-conforming packets at the edge
     provides an indication on the extent to which the network is
     carrying this type of packets (which can potentially be dropped if
     network gets congested).  Loss due to congestion of any packets,
     including loss of non-conforming packets, is a useful measure in
     traffic engineering to account for resource management.  (3) Long-
     term averages can be measured by the I.380/Y.1540 IP packet loss
     ratio or by the IPPM Poisson sampling of one-way loss.  However,
     during the convergence times associated with routing updating, the
     loss may be high enough as to cause service unavailability.  This
     effect needs to be captured and statistics such as loss patterns,
     burst loss, or severe loss ratio may be required (reference to be
     included).

   . Resource usage, such as link/router utilization, buffer occupancy
     (e.g., fraction of arriving packets finding the buffer above a
     given set of thresholds)
     Note:  Trigger points may be set when resource usage consistently
     exceeds a certain threshold.

   Entities related to establishment of connection or path

   Where connection admission control is used, a measurement entity for
   monitoring network performance may be the proportion of connections
   denied admission.  Also, it may be useful to score the requested
   bandwidth within the traffic parameters for the setup request.
   Corresponding to telecommunications network, connection request rate
   may be measured to characterize the offered traffic.

   To characterize paths, the following measurement entities may be
   defined: path setup delay, path setup error probability, path setup
   denial (blocking) probability, path release delay, path disconnect
   probability, path restoration time.

10. Measurement Types

   A measurement matrix can be defined wherein each column represents a
   measurement basis and each row represents a measurement entity.  An
   entry in this measurement matrix, corresponding to a meaningful and
   measurable combination of an entity and a basis, defines a
   particular measurement type.  For each measurement type, there
   should be a set of measurement points specified to bound the network

   segment for the purposes of taking measurement.  A measurement point
   may be the physical boundary between a node and an adjacent link, or
   the logical interface between two protocol layers in a protocol
   stack.

   The following measurement matrix illustrates some of the measurement
   types related to traffic or performance.  Potentially, there can be
   one such matrix for each service class.

   Notes:
   (1) This measurement type can be used to derive flow size
   statistics.
   (2) These are 1-point measurements.
   (3) As a starting point, statistics collected by passive measurement
   through the MPLS traffic engineering MIBs [7, 8, 9] may be used.
   (4) Active measurements based on IPPM metrics are currently in use
   for node-pairs; they may be developed for paths.
   (5) Besides active measurements based on IPPM, path loss may
   possibly be inferred from the difference between ingress and egress
   traffic statistics at the two endpoints of a path.  However, such
   inference for the cumulative losses between a given node pair over
   multiple routes may be less useful, since different routes may have
   different loss characteristics.

   Another measurement matrix can be constructed for resource
   consumption.  This leads to a set of measurement types comprising
   the different usage, one for each network resource object such as
   router, link, and buffer, by different classes of traffic:

   . control (e.g., routing control) traffic
   . signaling traffic
   . user traffic from different service classes

                        Bases:   Node     Link    Buffer
           Entities:
           Control Util.           x        x        x
           Signaling Util.         x        x        x
           Service Class Util.     x        x        x

   The amount of control and signaling traffic carried by a network is
   a function of many factors.  To name a few, they include the size

   and topology of the network, the control and signaling protocols
   used, the amount of user traffic carried, the number of failure
   events, etc.  The above utilization measurements for control and
   signaling traffic are intended to help develop guidelines for the
   proper dimensioning and apportionment of network resources so that a
   given level of user traffic can be adequately supported.  As the
   primary focus here is on user traffic measurements, the additional
   needs and properties of control and signaling traffic measurements
   are beyond the scope of this document.

11. Traffic Matrix Statistics

   An important set of data for traffic engineering is point-to-point
   or point-to-multipoint demands.  This data is needed in the
   provisioning of intradomain routes and external peering in the
   existing network, as well as planning for the placement and sizing
   of new links, routers, or peers.

   In current practice, estimates for traffic demands are usually
   determined from a combination of traffic projections, customer
   prescriptions, and SLAs.  Under existing mode of operation, it is
   not easy to obtain network-wide traffic demands from the local
   interface measurements taken by different IP routers. As explained
   in [10, 11], information from diverse network measurements and
   various configuration files are needed to infer the traffic volume.
   Besides raw measurement data, additional information such as
   topological data and router configuration data are required to
   obtain a network view.  Furthermore, destination-based
   routing/forwarding in IGP (such as OSPF or IS-IS) provides a network
   operator with primitive and limited control over the routing of
   traffic flows.  This necessitates the association of a time sequence
   of forwarding tables from different routers to reconstruct the
   different routes used by the network over time. By using this
   auxiliary information, together with flow-based measurements, the
   above-cited references describe how to determine the traffic volume
   from an ingress link to a set of egress links by validating and
   joining various data sets together.

   The routing control offered by MPLS can be used to avoid the above
   shortcomings of existing measurements.  It is recommended that path-
   based passive measurement for traffic volume, average holding time,
   and available bandwidth be developed so that traffic matrix
   statistics, on a per service class basis, can be derived.

   Besides traffic engineering, a major application of MPLS is the
   support of network-based virtual private networks (VPNs).  A VPN can
   be an enterprise network or a carrier's carrier network.  Path-based
   measurement by a network operator on behalf of the VPN customers
   facilitates the estimation of the traffic offered by these VPNs.

12. Performance Monitoring

Internet-Draft  Framework for Internet Traffic Measurement    May 2001


   General aspects of measurements required to support the operation,
   administration, and maintenance of a network are outside the scope
   of this document (see [12] for a discussion of MPLS OAM).  The focus
   of the measurements here is only on operations related to traffic
   engineering and network performance management.

   A major component of performance management is performance
   monitoring, i.e., continuous real-time monitoring of the quality or
   health of the network and its various elements to ensure a
   sustained, uninterrupted delivery of quality service.  This requires
   the use of measurement, either passively or actively, to collect
   information about the operational state of the network and to track
   its performance.  For a discussion of passive monitoring and the use
   of synthetic traffic sources in active probing, see [13].  Alarms
   may be generated when the state of a network element exceeds
   prescribed thresholds.

   Performance degradation can occur as a result of routing
   instability, congestion, or failure of network components.  Periods
   of congestion may be detected when the resource usage of a network
   segment consistently exceeds a certain threshold, or when the cross-
   router delay is unexpectedly high.  After the identification of a
   hot spot, active throughput measurement may be used to seek out
   alternate routes for congestion bypass.  Unexpected excessive loss
   of packets or throughput drops may be used as a means of fault
   detection, and may result in restoration activities.

   Internet utilities such as ping and traceroute have been useful to
   help diagnose network problems and performance debugging.  Utilities
   with similar functions would be essential for path-oriented
   operations like in MPLS.  This would include the capability to list,
   at any time, (1) for a given path, all the nodes traversed by it,
   and (2) for a given node, all the paths originating from it,
   transiting through it, and/or terminating on it.  A proposal for
   route tracing is described in [14].

13. Report Generation

   Data storage, data processing, statistics generation and reporting
   are outside the scope of this document.

14. Annex: Traffic Measurement Requirements

   (Note:  This annex may be spun off as a separate document when it
   matures.)

   The contents of this annex are to be provided.  For example, it
   should specify some expected range of service-specific measurement
   intervals, read-out periods, and busy periods.  Also, it should
   specify the different reference points in the traffic flow for both
   node-pair-based and path-based measurements, and their associated
   measurement types.
