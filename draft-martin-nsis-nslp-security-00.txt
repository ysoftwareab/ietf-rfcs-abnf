Internet-Draft    NAT/FW NSLP Security infrastructure       October 2003


1. Introduction

   The NAT/Firewall traversal NSLP for the NSIS protocol is a highly
   sensitive service.  Because of its functionality, it can potentially
   open paths to networks otherwise protected by NAT/FW infrastructures.
   It also has the potential to render NAT/FW infrastructures
   inoperative, closing paths or exhausting the resources of the
   involved boxes.

   For this reason, a tight security scheme has to be devised, to allow
   both fine and coarse access control.  This draft aims at solving this
   problem by using cryptographic digital signatures to authenticate the
   peers.  Decisions on whether to allow access or not are based on the
   authenticity of the requesting peer and the security policy
   configured in the box.

2. Problems to solve

   The NAT/FW traversal NSLP provides the following security sensitive
   services:

   1.  Firewall traversal: override specifically set access rules, and
       allow data transfer through firewall devices, both from the
       inside out and the outside in.

   2.  NAT traversal: reach machines in a private network, which were
       not meant to be accessible from the outside without specific
       setups.

   3.  Resource allocation: Install packet filters and NAT bindings on a
       machine that can only allocate a certain number of them.

   Misuse of these services can compromise the network and even render
   it inoperable.  The NSIS-Threats document [1] shows a number of ways
   in which such services can be exploited

3. Solution requirements

   Given the problems and its exploit possibilities, our solution will
   have to cover the following requirements:

   1.  Nodes must be able to verify the authenticity of the requests

   2.  Message integrity has to be warranted

   3.  Nodes must have the last word in deciding whether they accept a
       session or not

   The requirements listed can only be met by cryptographic methods,
   namely, digital signatures.  Through its use, nodes could be sure of
   who is making a request, and what request it is, and match it with an
   access list, or any other more complex decision mechanism.

   This approach provides great flexibility, as the decision process can
   be arbitrarily complex, and based on trustful data.  For instance, we
   might want to authorize certain identities, or allow for only a
   number of connections per id to be accepted.  More open systems with
   full access would have a chance to black list users.

4. Digital signatures: generic pros and cons

   Digital signatures provide a secure way of transmitting messages:
   they proof that the author is who he says he is, and that what he is
   saying has not been altered.  In other words, authentication and
   integrity, both strictly necessary if a node has to take security
   sensitive actions.

   No other mechanism nowadays provides all the functionalities of
   public key cryptography, and thus this becomes a perfect candidate to
   provide security on the NAT/FW NSLP.

   This, of course, comes at a cost; We will face three main problems:

   o  Signature verification requires the public key of the sender.
      This key has to be known and trusted before a signature can be
      validated safely.

   o  Public key cryptography has a high computational cost, in
      comparison to other cryptography algorithms and authentication
      systems

   o  Introducing signatures on a message implies a certain overhead


4.1 Public key deployment

   The NAT/FW NSLP is expected to enable connections between peers that
   don't necessarily know each other.  This of course, collides with the
   necessity of knowing the public key of the sender to verify it's
   signatures.

   Later in this document (Section 6.1) we try to analyze what nodes are
   likely to know each other, and where we can expect the public keys to
   have been securely exchanged.

   On the other hand, the necessity of cyphered, authenticated and non
   tampered communications seems to set a trend towards proper public
   key infrastructure deployments.  Nowadays, though, no such public
   global infrastructure exists.

4.2 Computational cost

   Commonly available public key cryptography provides rather fast
   algorithms, with verification/signature times around the 13.0/6.8
   milliseconds on 450MHz UltraSPARC II processor [4].

   This should not be an excessive load when considering a running

   server, but is of special relevance when facing Denial of Service
   attacks.  In this case, the longer it takes to process a request
   (even if only to reject it), the easier it is to overload the machine
   into uselessness.  Performance analysis should be undertaken to
   evaluate these risks.  We must consider, though, that authentication
   and integrity will require some form of cryptography, and that will
   require a certain degree of computational power.

4.3 Incurred overhead

   Digital signatures, using the DSA algorithm, have a length of about
   320 bits, and even shorter algorithms exist [5]

   The NSLP packet payload proposed in [6] has a size of 23 bytes.
   Adding a signature of 40 bytes implies a 200% packet length increase.

   For this reason, we must carefully choose the kind of signature we
   use, to minimize the introduced overhead.

5. Digital signatures on an NSIS scenario

   We have seen the values and the problems involved in digital
   signatures.  In this section we will particularize it to the
   scenarios we will face in an NSIS NAT/FW NSLP.

5.1 Public key deployment. Known peers

   If we intend to use digital signatures, we must first inquire on the
   availability of the public keys.  Middle boxes will have a very
   limited number of them available, due to the difficulty of publishing
   them securely.

   Neighbouring peers can not be assumed to have their public keys
   exchanged.  The reason is that, even though, a middle box has a very
   limited number of one-hop neighbours, it is NSIS NAT/FW NSLP aware
   neighbours that we are concerned about.  As a first approach, we must
   consider that the border middle boxes of each network on the internet
   have each other as potential one-nsis-hop peers.  This keeps us from
   using simpler methods, (may be even not based on public key
   cryptography), and forces us to carefully decide whether border
   middle boxes will ever know each other, as this is basic for the
   solution design.

5.2 Messages changing en route

   Let us assume a create message, as defined in [6].  It contains a
   source address for the pinhole specification.  Let us now suppose it
   goes through a NAT.  Ideally, an external address and port will be
   reserved, and the create message will be modified accordingly.

   This step, necessary for the basic protocol functionality, also means
   that any previous packet signature will be broken, since the message
   changes.

   Specifically, the source or target address can change when traversing
   a NAT, as shown in Figure 1:

     +------+                               +------+


     DS: Data Sender
     DR: Data Receiver



           Figure 1: Message alterations when traversing NATs

   When a create message from DS to DR traverses NAT1, the pinhole
   source address must change, since the potential data packets that
   will use the pinhole, will appear to come from the NAT1 external
   address.

   Similarly, when the create packet reaches NAT2, it matches a
   reservation, and redirects it to DR.  Any other boxes between NAT2
   and DR would see the potential data packets as heading towards DR and
   not NAT2 any more; for this reason, the destination address of the
   pinhole in the create message has to be altered accordingly.

   This basically means we will not be able to protect the source and
   destination addresses in the NAT/FW NSLP messages, since they change
   on the way.  Because of that, other mechanisms will have to be
   devised, as we will see in Section 6.1

6. Proposed solution

   At this point, we are left with the necessity of digital signatures,
   but also with several restrictions:

   o  Too many signatures involve excessive overhead, computational
      cost, etc..

   o  We have to consider signature validity, be it because the message
      changed, or because the public key is not available

   If we manage to use them properly, we will be able to provide
   authentication and integrity.  But we are also interested in
   authorization.  The step from authenticating to authorizing is often
   policy based.  It is then reasonable to assume an arbitrarily complex
   decision engine to issue verdicts based on the data we can provide
   it.

   Note then, that whether an NSIS NAT/FW NSLP request is honored or
   not, will depend on the decision engine, which, may or may not take
   into consideration the authentication information we provide it.  A
   first approach to this engine is given in Figure 2.



        Session ID          ---\
        Verified (yes/no)   ----\    +----------+      /-- Honored
                                 \   |          |     /
        Pinhole source      ------>--| Decision |---<----- Remembered
        Verified (yes/no)   ------>--|  Engine  |     \
                                 /   |          |      \-- Rejected
        Pinhole destination ----/    +----------+
        Verified (yes/no)   ---/



                Figure 2: The decision engine interface

   Based on the Session ID and pinhole specification, and whether that
   data has is trustworthy because it has been verified with a known
   signature, the decision engine decides from three options:

   o  Honored: The request is accepted, and the required rules installed

   o  Remembered: The request is not trusted, and thus not installed,
      but is kept awaiting for a certain time, expecting later
      validations.

Internet-Draft    NAT/FW NSLP Security infrastructure       October 2003


   o  Rejected: The petition is ignored completely

   Note that if the decision engine returns a reject, the communication
   will not be possible at all.

   Possible policies on the decision engines are:

   o  The basic one: authorize certain sources or destinations to use
      certain pinholes

   o  Allow a certain request rate or amount and deny the rest.  For
      instance, the node next to an ISP, will allow as many connections
      as the ISP contracts

   o  Allow requests for internal IP's, independently of their
      signatures

   o  Allow all but perform accounting operations

   We are now left with the problem of using digital signatures wisely
   to provide adequate input to the Decision Engine

6.1 Implementation of digital signatures in the NAT/FW NSLP

   What and where we sign is greatly related to trust relationships
   between middle boxes.  A detailed description of the different kinds
   of trust can be found in [1].  In our approach, we expect end to end
   trust, and hope for peer to peer trust in some of the hops.

   For end to end trust, we will have DS sign the Session ID and include
   it in the object.  For peer to peer, we will sign the whole object on
   each hop.  In other words, the object will include:

   1.  Session ID signature: Session ID signed by DS except for Path
       Succeeded messages, where it is signed by the previous hop on the
       return path.

   2.  Previous hop signature: Pinhole source and destination (if
       applicable), Session ID and Session ID signed by DS, plus other
       objects, all of it signed by the previous hop

   The first signature will be added by the NSLP.  The second one,
   though, since it refers to the whole packet , might be implemented on
   the transport layer (NTLP).  In the case that the NTLP didn't include
   this service, it could be pushed up on the NSLP.

   Note that the specific syntax and algorithms used to sign the
   messages are not specified here.  A standardized flexible option such

   as CMS [2] could be used, but might be too cumbersome.  A simple DSA
   signature might suffice.

   We recommend looking at the examples in Section 7 for detailed
   working flows that help understand this specific use of digital
   signatures.

7. Solution examples

7.1 Network with firewalls

   In this basic network, we have two hosts, on their respective
   networks, each behind a firewall that needs to be signaled for the
   path to be open.  The FW1 belongs to DS's network, and FW2 belongs to
   DR's, as the hierarchical structure suggests in Figure 3


     +-----+                               +-----+
     | FW1 |-------------------------------| FW2 |
     +-----+                               +-----+
        |                                     |
     +-----+                               +-----+
     | DS  |                               | DR  |
     +-----+                               +-----+


     FW: Firewall
     DS: Data Sender
     DR: Data Receiver


                       Figure 3: Firewall network

   When the signaling begins, DS sends a create message to FW1.  We
   expect FW to honour the request for one of these reasons:

   o  It allows end hosts inside it's network to open pinholes (perhaps
      only a given range)

   o  It knows DS's public key and thus verifies the request using the
      previous hop signature, and it's policies allow this transaction

   FW2 gets the forwarded packet, but is not likely to honor it, because
   it probably does not know FW1's public key, and can not validate it's
   origin.  We expect it to remember the rule and forward the NSIS
   packet.

   DR gets it next.  It does know DS, and can verify the Session ID
   signature.  It can also verify the target address, because it is
   itself, and it is expecting this signaling (probably because of some
   other application layer communication

   DR replies then with a Path Succeeded message, that includes the
   Session ID signature signed by DR.




Martin, et al.           Expires April 19, 2004                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft    NAT/FW NSLP Security infrastructure       October 2003


   This message gets to FW2, who does know DR, and so verifies the
   Session ID signature.  That verifies for him the destination of the
   pinhole, and the Session ID, which it was remembering.  It is
   re-entered into the decision engine, which this time, honours the
   request.

   It then gets to FW1 which already honoured that Session ID, and to
   DS, who starts data transfer on the newly created pinhole path

   Note that in this example, the message does not change en route, but
   this is only true because there are no NATs on the data path.  Note
   also that DR and FW2 can not verify the source address.  This is a
   weakness indeed, but it is not of extreme importance, since any
   malicious node that is able to change the nsis packet source address,
   is also capable of dropping the data packets afterwards.

7.2 Network with NATs

   This network is analogous to the example Section 7.1 but has NATs
   instead of firewalls, as shown in Figure 4.


     +------+                               +------+
     | NAT1 |-------------------------------| NAT2 |

     | DS  |                                | DR  |
     +-----+                                +-----+


     DS: Data Sender
     DR: Data Receiver


                         Figure 4: NAT network

   Note how exactly the same signaling (security wise) as in the
   previous example would also work here.  That is meant to be so,
   because DS and DR do not need to know the topology of the data path.

   We can see though, how the pinhole source changes after NAT1, and the
   pinhole destination changes after NAT2, which means we can not sign
   the whole packet at DS, for instance.

   From now on, we will refer to the nodes as middle boxes, since, in
   what concerns security, there is no change in how we deal with them.

7.3 Networks with several Middle boxes

   We now increase complexity to show the signaling through more than
   one middle box per network, as shown in Figure 5.

     MB: Middle box (NAT or Firewall or a combination)

               Figure 5: Several middle boxes per network

   DS sends a create message, which is honored by MB1, for the same
   reasons as in Section 7.1.  We expect MB2 to accept it as well,
   because it knows MB1 (peer to peer trust) and the policy allows it.

   MB3 and MB4, again as in Section 7.1 will remember the rule, but not
   install it.  When DR gets it and validates it, MB4 will honor the
   request, and will sign the session ID itself.  This is what makes MB3
   trust the request and honor it.

   Again, notice how we can not protect the source address.

7.4 Middle boxes on foreign networks

   We now face the problem of middle boxes somewhere on the Internet,
   that do not belong to DS's or DR's network, as shown inFigure 6.

                 Figure 6: Middle boxes on the Internet

   This scenario is rather rare, and presents the problem that MB2 is
   unlikely to have a peer to peer trust relationship with any of the
   other middle boxes.  In this case, either the decision engine has a
   rather loose policy that accepts unverified requests, or the
   communication does not succeed.

8. Optional extensions

   The proposed combination of signatures and handling is expected to
   provide authorization in most of the cases.  There is a special case
   which might provide an extra level of security by securely
   establishing the source of the pinhole in DS's network.  This is
   achieved by adding an extra signature in the NSLP, next to the
   Session ID signature.  The data to be signed is the Session ID and
   the source of the pinhole.  It is to be signed by DS or the last nat
   to have modified the source address.

   The relevant scenario is shown on Figure 7:


     +-----+                                   +-----+
     | FW1 |-----------------------------------| MB2 |
     +-----+                                   +-----+
        |                                         |
     +-----+                                   +-----+
     | DS  |                                   | DR  |
     +-----+                                   +-----+


     MB: Middle box (NAT or Firewall or a combination)
     DS: Data Sender
     DR: Data Receiver



                 Figure 7: End to middle authorization

   Assume that MB2 does not know FW1, but it does know DS.  Such a case
   would be that of a company (MB2) allowing it's employees working
   abroad to install pinholes even if connecting through an ISP (which
   runs a firewall, FW1).  The special signature we added would allow
   MB2 to authenticate DS as the source.  Something that FW1 could not
   do, because it is not known byMB2.

   This would be a case of end to middle trust.

9. Security Considerations

   This entire memo discusses the security implications of using an NSIS
   NAT/FW NSLP.

10. Conclusions

   The proposed method provides a reasonable way to decide wheter to
   honor or not NSIS NAT/FW NSLP requests.  Peer to peer trust is
   expected within the network, and a certain degree of flexibility is
   also expected in the pinhole source.

   Further field research is required to determine if we are actually
   covering most of the real life scenarios.
