        Alternate Tunnel Encapsulation for Data Frames in CAPWAP
                    draft-zhang-opsawg-capwap-cds-02

Abstract

   CAPWAP defines a specification to encapsulate a station's data frames
   between the Wireless Transmission Point (WTP) and Access Controller
   (AC) using CAPWAP.  Specifically, the station's IEEE 802.11 data
   frames can be either locally bridged or tunneled to the AC.  When
   tunneled, a CAPWAP data channel is used for tunneling.  In many
   deployments it is desirable to encapsulate date frames to an entity
   different from the AC for example to an Access Router (AR).  Further,
   it may also be desirable to use different tunnel encapsulations to
   carry the stations' data frames.  This document provides a
   specification for this and refers to it as Alternate tunnel
   encapsulation.  The Alternate tunnel encapsulation allows 1) the WTP
   to tunnel non-management data frames to an endpoint different from
   the AC and 2) the WTP to tunnel using one of many known encapsulation
   types such as IP-IP, IP-GRE, CAPWAP.  The WTP may advertise support
   for Alternate tunnel encapsulation during the discovery or join
   process and AC may select one of the supported Alternate Tunnel
   encapsulation types while configuring the WTP.

1.  Introduction

   CAPWAP ([RFC5415], [RFC5416]) defines a tunnel mode that specifies
   the frame tunneling type to be used for 802.11 data frames from
   stations associated with the WLAN.  The following types are
   supported:

   o  Local Bridging: All user traffic is to be locally bridged.
   o  802.3 Tunnel: All user traffic is to be tunneled to the AC in
      802.3 format.

   o  802.11 Tunnel: All user traffic is to be tunneled to the AC in
      802.11 format.

   There are two shortcomings with currently specified tunneled modes:
   1) it does not allow the WTP to tunnel data frames to an endpoint
   different from the AC and 2) it does not allow the WTP to tunnel data
   frames using any encapsulation other than CAPWAP (as specified in
   Section 4.4.2 of [RFC5415]).  Next, we describe what is driving the
   above mentioned two requirements.

   Some operators deploying large number of Access Points prefer to
   centralize the management and control of Access Points while
   distributing the handling of data traffic to increase scaling.  This
   motivates an architecture as shown in Figure 1 that has the AC in a
   centralized location and one or more tunnel gateways (or Access
   Routers) that terminate the data tunnels from the various WTPs.  This
   split architecture has two benefits over an architecture where data
   traffic is aggregated at the AC: 1) reduces the scale requirement on
   data traffic handling capability of the AC and 2) leads to more
   efficient/optimal routing of data traffic.

                  Locally Bridged

            Figure 1: Centralized Control with Distributed Data

   The above system (shown in Figure 1) could be achieved by setting the
   tunnel mode to Local bridging.  In such a case the AC would handle
   control of WTPs as well as handle the management traffic to/from the
   stations.  There is CAPWAP Control and Data Channel between the WTP
   and the AC.  The CAPWAP Data channel carries the IEEE 802.11
   management traffic (like IEEE 802.11 Action Frames).  The station's
   data frames are locally bridged, i.e., not carried over the CAPWAP
   data channel.  The station's data frames are handled by the Access
   Router.  However, in many deployments the operator managing the WTPs/
   AC may be different from the operator providing the internet

   connectivity to the WTPs.  Further, the WTP operator may want (or be
   required by legal/regulatory requirements) to tunnel the traffic back
   to an Access Router in its network as shown in Figure 2.  The
   tunneling requirement may be driven by the need to apply policy at
   the Access Router or a legal requirement to support lawful intercept
   of user traffic.  What this means is that local bridging does not
   meet their requirements.  Their requriements are met either by having
   the WTP tunnel the station's traffic to the AC or the WTP support an
   alternate tunnel, i.e., a tunnel to an alternate entity different
   from the AC.  This is the motivation for Alternate Tunnel
   encapsulation support where the data tunnels from the WTP are
   terminated at an AR (and more specifically at an end point different
   from the AC).

          Tunnel to AR

            Figure 2: Centralized Control with Distributed Data

   In the case where the WTP is tunneling data frames to an AR (and not
   the AC), the choice of tunnel encapsulation need not be restricted
   only to CAPWAP (as described in Section 4.4.2 of [RFC5415]).  In
   fact, the WTP may additionally support other widely used
   encapsulation types such as L2TP, L2TPv3, IP-in-IP, IP/GRE, etc.  The
   WTP may advertise the different alternate tunnel encapsulation types
   supported and the AC can select one of the supported encapsulation
   types.  As shown in the figure there is still a CAPWAP control and
   data channel between the WTP and AC wherein the CAPWAP data channel
   carries the stations' management traffic.  Thus the WTP will maintain
   three tunnels: CAPWAP Control, CAPWAP Data, and another (alternate)
   tunnel to the AR.  The main reason to maintain a CAPWAP data channel
   is to minimize the changes on the WTP and AC required to transport
   stations' management frames (like EAP, IEEE 802.11 Action Frames).
   These management frames are transported over the CAPWAP data channel
   as they are done for case when the WTP's tunnel mode is configured as

   the local bridging.  In this specification we describe how the WTP
   can be configured with this alternate tunnel.

   The above example describes how the alternate tunnel encapsulation
   may be established.  When the WTP joins the AC, it should indicate
   its alternate tunnel encapsulation capability.  The AC would
   determine whether an alternate tunnel configuration is required.  If
   required, it would select an appropriate alternate tunnel
   encapsulation.  The AC provides the alternate tunnel encapsulation

   specific information.  The tunnel specific information may contain
   configuration information to help the WTP setup the tunnel.  For
   example, the IP address of the access router that will terminate the
   WTP tunnel.  Once the WTP sets up the tunnel, the WTP may inform the
   AC about the tunnel setup.  Correspondingly, if the WTP discovers
   that the tunneled link to the AR has failed, then it may inform the

         +  IEEE 802.11 Tagging Policy

         This specification only defines a generic container for such
         message elements.  We anticipate that these message elements
         (for the different protocols) will be defined in separate
         documents, potentially one for each tunneling protocols.  See
         [I-D.xue-opsawg-capwap-separation-capability] for example of
         such a specification.

   To be specified in later versions

4.  Security Considerations
