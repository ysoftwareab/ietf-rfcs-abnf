1.  Introduction

   It is common for HTTP responses to contain links to external
   resources that need to be fetched prior to their use; for example,
   rendering HTML by a Web browser.  Having such links available to the
   client as early as possible helps to minimize perceived latency.

   The "preload" ([Preload]) link relation can be used to convey such
   links in the Link header field of an HTTP response.  However, it is
   not always possible for an origin server to generate a response
   header block immediately after receiving a request.  For example, the
   origin server might need to query a database before generating a
   response, or it might delegate a request to an upstream HTTP server
   running at a distant location.

   The dilemma here is that even though it is preferable for an origin
   server to send some headers as soon as it receives a request, it
   cannot do so until the status code and the full headers of the final
   HTTP response are determined.

   HTTP/2 ([RFC7540]) server push can be used as a solution to this
   issue, but has its own limitations.  The responses that can be pushed

   using HTTP/2 are limited to those belonging to the same origin.
   Also, it is impossible to send only the links using server push.
   Finally, sending HTTP responses for every resource is an inefficient
   way of using bandwidth, especially when a caching server exists as an
   intermediary.

   This memo defines a status code for sending an informational response
   ([RFC7231], section 6.2) that contains headers that are likely to be
   included in the final response.  A server can send the informational
   response containing some of the headers to help the client start
   making preparations for processing the final response, and then run
   time-consuming operations to generate the final response.  The
   informational response can also be used by an origin server to
   trigger HTTP/2 server push at a caching intermediary.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  103 Early Hints

   The 103 (Early Hints) informational status code indicates the client
   that the server is likely to send a final response with the headers
   included in the informational response.

   A server MUST NOT include Content-Length, Transfer-Encoding, or any
   hop-by-hop header fields ([RFC7230], section 6.1) in a 103 (Early
   Hints) response.

   A client MAY speculatively evaluate the headers included in a 103
   (Early Hints) response while waiting for the final response.  For
   example, a client might recognize a Link header field value
   containing the relation type "preload" and start fetching the target
   resource.

   However, this MUST NOT affect how the final response is processed;
   when handling it, the client MUST behave as if it had not seen the
   informational response.  In particular, a client MUST NOT process the
   headers included in the final response as if they belonged to the
   informational response, or vice versa.

   An intermediary MAY drop the informational response.  It MAY send
   HTTP/2 ([RFC7540]) server pushes using the information found in the
   103 (Early Hints) response.

3.  Security Considerations

   Some clients may have issues handling 103 (Early Hints), since
   informational responses are rarely used in reply to requests not
   including an Expect header ([RFC7231], section 5.1.1).

   In particular, an HTTP/1.1 client that mishandles an informational
   response as a final response is likely to consider all responses to
   the succeeding requests sent over the same connection to be part of
   the final response.  Such behavior may constitute a cross-origin
   information disclosure vulnerability in case the client multiplexes
   requests to different origins onto a single persistent connection.

   Therefore, a server might refrain from sending Early Hints over
   HTTP/1.1 unless when the client is known to handle informational
   responses correctly.

   HTTP/2 clients are less likely to suffer from incorrect framing since
   handling of the response headers does not affect how the end of the
   response body is determined.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The HTTP Status Codes Registry will be updated with the following
   entry:

   o  Code: 103

   o  Description: Early Hints

   o  Specification: [this document]

5.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa for coming up with the idea of sending
   the link headers using an informational response.

6.  Changes

6.1.  Since draft-ietf-httpbis-early-hints-01

   o  Editorial changes.

6.2.  Since draft-ietf-httpbis-early-hints-00

   o  Forbid processing the headers of a 103 response as part of the
      informational response.
