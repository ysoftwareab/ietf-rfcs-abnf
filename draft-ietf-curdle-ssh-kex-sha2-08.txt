Internet-Draft KEX Method Updates/Recommendations for SSH     April 2017


1.  Overview and Rationale

   Secure Shell (SSH) is a common protocol for secure communication on
   the Internet.  In [RFC4253], SSH originally defined two Key Exchange
   Method Names that MUST be implemented.  Over time, what was once
   considered secure, is no longer considered secure.  The purpose of
   this RFC is to recommend that some published key exchanges be
   deprecated.  This document updates [RFC4250].

   This document adds recommendations for adoption of Key Exchange
   Methods which MUST, SHOULD+, SHOULD, SHOULD-, MAY, SHOULD NOT, and
   MUST NOT be implemented.  New key exchange methods will use the SHA-2
   family of hashes and are drawn from these ssh-curves from
   [I-D.ietf-curdle-ssh-curves] and new-modp from the
   [I-D.ietf-curdle-ssh-modp-dh-sha2] and gss-keyex [NEWGSSAPI].

   [TO BE REMOVED: Please send comments on this draft to
   curdle@ietf.org.]

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   When used in the tables in this document, these terms indicate that
   the listed algorithm MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT or MAY be
   implemented as part of a Secure Shell implementation.  Additional
   terms used in this document are:

    SHOULD+   This term means the same as SHOULD. However, it is likely
              that an algorithm marked as SHOULD+ will be promoted at
              some future time to be a MUST.
    SHOULD-   This term means the same as SHOULD. However, an algorithm
              marked as SHOULD- may be deprecated to a MAY in a future
              version of this document.

3.  Key Exchange Methods

   This memo adopts the style and conventions of [RFC4253] in specifying
   how the use of data key exchange is indicated in SSH.

   This RFC also collects Key Exchange Method Names in various existing
   RFCs [RFC4253], [RFC4419], [RFC4432], [RFC4462], [RFC5656],
   [I-D.ietf-curdle-ssh-modp-dh-sha2], [NEWGSSAPI], and
   [I-D.ietf-curdle-ssh-curves] and provides a suggested suitability for
   implementation of MUST, SHOULD+, SHOULD, SHOULD-, SHOULD NOT, and
   MUST NOT.  Any method not explicitly listed, MAY be implemented.

Internet-Draft KEX Method Updates/Recommendations for SSH     April 2017


   This document is intended to provide guidance as to what Key Exchange
   Algorithms are to be considered for new or updated SSH
   implementations.  This document will be superseded when one or more
   of the listed algorithms are considered too weak to continue to use
   securely, or when newer methods have been analyzed and found to be
   secure with wide enough adoption to upgrade their recommendation from
   MAY to SHOULD or MUST.

3.1.  curve25519-sha256

   The Curve25519 provides strong security and is efficient on a wide
   range of architectures with properties that allow better
   implementation properties compared to traditional elliptic curves.
   The use of SHA2-256 for integrity is a reasonable one for this
   method.  This Key Exchange Method has multiple implementations and
   SHOULD+ be implemented in any SSH interested in using elliptic curve
   based key exchanges.

3.2.  diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1

   This set of ephemerally generated key exchange groups uses SHA-1 as
   defined in [RFC4419].  However, SHA-1 has security concerns provided
   in [RFC6194].  It is recommended that these key exchange groups NOT
   be used.  This key exchange MUST NOT be used.

3.3.  diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256

   This set of ephemerally generated key exchange groups uses SHA2-256
   as defined in [RFC4419].  It is recommended implementations avoid any
   MODP group with less than 2048 bits.  This key exchange MAY be used.

3.4.  diffie-hellman-group1-sha1

   This method uses [RFC7296] Oakley Group 2 (a 1024-bit MODP group) and
   SHA-1 [RFC3174].  Due to recent security concerns with SHA-1
   [RFC6194] and with MODP groups with less than 2048 bits
   [NIST-SP-800-131Ar1], this method is considered insecure.  This
   method is being moved from MUST to MUST NOT.

3.5.  diffie-hellman-group14-sha1

   This method uses [RFC3526] group14 (a 2048-bit MODP group) which has
   no concerns.  This generated key exchange group uses SHA-1 which has
   security concerns [RFC6194].  However, this group is still strong
   enough and is widely deployed.  This method is being moved from MUST
   to SHOULD- to aid in transition to stronger SHA-2 based hashes.  This
   method will transition to MUST NOT when SHA-2 alternatives are more
   generally available.

3.6.  diffie-hellman-group14-sha256

   This generated key exchange uses a 2048-bit sized MODP group along
   with a SHA-2 (SHA2-256) hash.  This represents the smallest Finite
   Field Cryptography (FFC) Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange method
   considered to be secure.  It is a reasonably simple transition to
   move from SHA-1 to SHA-2.  This method MUST be implemented.

3.7.  diffie-hellman-group16-sha512

   The use of FFC DH is well understood and trusted.  Adding larger
   modulus sizes and protecting with SHA2-512 should give enough head
   room to be ready for the next scare that someone has pre-computed.
   This modulus is larger than that required by [CNSA-SUITE] and should
   be sufficient to inter-operate with more paranoid nation-states.
   This method SHOULD+ be implemented.

3.8.  ecdh-sha2-nistp256

   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) are often implemented because
   they are smaller and faster than using large FFC primes with
   traditional Diffie-Hellman (DH).  However, given [CNSA-SUITE] and
   [safe-curves], this curve may not be as useful and strong as desired.
   The SSH development community is divided on this and many
   implementations do exist.  However, there are good implementations of
   this along with a constant-time SHA2-256 implementation.  If an
   implementer does not have a constant-time SHA2-384 implementation
   (which helps avoid side-channel attacks), then this is the correct
   ECDH to implement.  If traditional ECDH key exchange methods are
   implemented, then this method SHOULD- be implemented.

3.9.  ecdh-sha2-nistp384

   This ECDH method should be implemented because it is smaller and
   faster than using large FFC primes with traditional Diffie-Hellman
   (DH).  Given [CNSA-SUITE], it is considered good enough for TOP
   SECRET for now.  This really needs a constant-time implementation of
   SHA2-384 to be useful.  If traditional ECDH key exchange methods are
   implemented, then this method SHOULD+ be implemented.

3.10.  gss-gex-sha1-*

   This set of ephemerally generated key exchange groups uses SHA-1
   which has security concerns [RFC6194].  It is recommended that these
   key exchange groups NOT be used.  This key exchange MUST NOT be
   implemented.

Internet-Draft KEX Method Updates/Recommendations for SSH     April 2017


3.11.  gss-group1-sha1-*

   This method suffers from the same problems of diffie-hellman-
   group1-sha1.  It uses [RFC7296] Oakley Group 2 (a 1024-bit MODP
   group) and SHA-1 [RFC3174].  Due to recent security concerns with
   SHA-1 [RFC6194] and with MODP groups with less than 2048 bits
   [NIST-SP-800-131Ar1], this method is considered insecure.  This
   method MUST NOT be implemented.

3.12.  gss-group14-sha1-*

   This generated key exchange groups uses SHA-1 which has security
   concerns [RFC6194].  If GSS-API key exchange methods are being used,
   then this one SHOULD- be implemented until such time as SHA-2
   variants may be implemented and deployed.

3.13.  gss-group14-sha256-*

   If the GSS-API is to be used, then this method SHOULD be implemented.

3.14.  gss-group16-sha512-*

   If the GSS-API is to be used, then this method SHOULD+ be
   implemented.

3.15.  rsa1024-sha1

   The security of RSA 1024-bit modulus keys is not good enough any
   longer.  A minimum bit size should be 2048-bit groups.  This
   generated key exchange groups uses SHA-1 which has security concerns
   [RFC6194].  This method MUST NOT be implemented.

4.  Summary Guidance for Key Exchange Method Names

   The Implement column is the current recommendations of this RFC.  Key
   Exchange Method Names are listed alphabetically.

          rsa1024-sha1                       RFC4432    MUST NOT

   The full set of official [IANA-KEX] key algorithm method names not
   otherwise mentioned in this document MAY be implemented.

   The guidance of this document is that the SHA-1 algorithm hashing
   MUST NOT be used.  If it is used in implementations, it should only
   be provided for backwards compatibility, should not be used in new
   designs, and should be phased out of existing key exchanges as
   quickly as possible because of its known weaknesses.  Any key
   exchange using SHA-1 SHOULD NOT be in a default key exchange list if
   at all possible.  If they are needed for backward compatibility, they
   SHOULD be listed after all of the SHA-2 based key exchanges.

   The [RFC4253] MUST diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 method SHOULD- be
   retained for compatibility with older Secure Shell implementations.
   It is intended that this key exchange method be phased out as soon as
   possible.  It SHOULD be listed after all possible SHA-2 based key
   exchanges.

   It is believed that all current SSH implementations should be able to
   achieve an implementation of the "diffie-hellman-group14-sha256"
   method.  To that end, this is one method that MUST be implemented.

   Thanks to the following people for code to implement inter-operable
   exchanges using some of these groups as found in an this draft:
   Darren Tucker for OpenSSH and Matt Johnston for Dropbear.  And thanks
   to Iwamoto Kouichi for information about RLogin, Tera Term (ttssh)
   and Poderosa implementations also adopting new Diffie-Hellman groups
   based on this draft.

6.  Security Considerations

   This SSH protocol provides a secure encrypted channel over an
   insecure network.  It performs server host authentication, key
   exchange, encryption, and integrity protection.  It also derives a
   unique session ID that may be used by higher-level protocols.

   Full security considerations for this protocol are provided in
   [RFC4251]

   It is desirable to deprecate or remove key exchange method name that
   are considered weak.  A key exchange method may be weak because too
   few bits are used, or the hashing algorithm is considered too weak.

   The diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 is being moved from MUST to MUST NOT.
   This method used [RFC7296] Oakley Group 2 (a 1024-bit MODP group) and
   SHA-1 [RFC3174].  Due to recent security concerns with SHA-1
   [RFC6194] and with MODP groups with less than 2048 bits
   [NIST-SP-800-131Ar1], this method is no longer considered secure.

   The United States Information Assurance Directorate (IAD) at the
   National Security Agency (NSA) has published a FAQ
   [MFQ-U-OO-815099-15] suggesting that the use of Elliptic Curve
   Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) using the nistp256 curve and SHA-2 based hashes
   less than SHA2-384 are no longer sufficient for transport of Top
   Secret information.  It is for this reason that this draft moves
   ecdh-sha2-nistp256 from a MUST to MAY as a key exchange method.  This
   is the same reason that the stronger MODP groups being adopted.  As
   the MODP group14 is already present in most SSH implementations and
   most implementations already have a SHA2-256 implementation, so
   diffie-hellman-group14-sha256 is provided as an easy to implement and
   faster to use key exchange.  Small embedded applications may find
   this KEX desirable to use.

   The NSA Information Assurance Directorate (IAD) has also published
   the Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite (CNSA Suite)
   [CNSA-SUITE] in which the 3072-bit MODP Group 15 in [RFC3526] is
   explicitly mentioned as the minimum modulus to protect Top Secret
   communications.

   It has been observed in [safe-curves] that the NIST Elliptic Curve
   Prime Curves (P-256, P-384, and P-521) are perhaps not the best
   available for Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Security.  For this
   reason, none of the [RFC5656] curves are mandatory to implement.
   However, the requirement that "every compliant SSH ECC implementation
   MUST implement ECDH key exchange" is now taken to mean that if ecdsa-
   sha2-[identifier] is implemented, then ecdh-sha2-[identifier] MUST be
   implemented.

   In a Post-Quantum Computing (PQC) world, it will be desirable to use
   larger cyclic subgroups.  To do this using Elliptic Curve
   Cryptography will require much larger prime base fields, greatly
   reducing their efficiency.  Finite Field based Cryptography already
   requires large enough base fields to accommodate larger cyclic
   subgroups.  Until such time as a PQC method of key exchange is
   developed and adopted, it may be desirable to generate new and larger
   DH groups to avoid precalcualtion attacks that are provably not
   backdoored.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to annotate entries in [IANA-KEX] which MUST NOT be
   implemented as being deprecated by this document.
