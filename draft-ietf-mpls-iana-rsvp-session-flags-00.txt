Abstract

   This document provides instructions to IANA for the creation of a new
   codepoint registry for the flags field in the Session Attribute
   object of the Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic Engineeging
   (RSVP-TE) signaling messages used in Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) signaling.

1. Introduction

   The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) [RFC2205] has been extended
   as Rsvp for Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for use in Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) signaling [RFC3209] and Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS) [RFC3473].

   [RFC3209] introduced a new signaling object, the Session Attribute
   object, that is carried on the RSVP Path message. The Session
   Attribute object contains an eight-bit field of flags.

   The original specification of RSVP-TE assigned uses to three of
   these bit flags. Subsequent MPLS and GMPLS RFCs have assigned further
   flags.

   There is a need for a codepoint registry to track the use of the bit
   flags in this field, to ensure that bits are not assigned more than
   once, and to define the procedures by which such bits may be
   assigned.

   This document lists the current bit usage and provides information
   for IANA to create a new registry. This document does not define the
   uses of specific bits - definitive procedures for the use of the
   bits can be found in the referenced RFCs.

2. Existing Usage

2.1. RFC 3209

   [RFC3209] defines the use of three bits as follows:

    0x01  Local protection desired

    0x02  Label recording desired

    0x04  SE Style desired

2.2. RFC 4090

   [RFC4090] defines the use of two bits as follows:

    0x08  Bandwidth protection desired

    0x10  Node protection desired

2.3. RFC XXXX
[RFC Editor:
 Please replace XXXX above with the RFC number assigned for
 draft-ietf-ccamp-loose-path-reopt, and make the same change in the
 references.
 Please remove this note prior to publication.]

   [RFCXXXX] defines the use of one bit as follows:

   0x20  Path re-evaluation request

3. Security Considerations

   This informational document exists purely to create an IANA registry.
   Such registries help to protect the IETF process against Denial of
   Service attacks.

   Otherwise there are no security considerations for this document.

4. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create a new codepoint registry as follows.

   The new registry should be placed under the "RSVP-TE Parameters"
   branch of the tree.

   The new registry should be termed "Session Attribute Object Flags."

   Flags from this registry may only be assigned by IETF consensus.

   The registry should reference the flags already defined as described
   in section 2 of this document.
