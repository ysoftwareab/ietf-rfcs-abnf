                                Abstract

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
particular, it describes managed objects used for implementations of the
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [4] in an IP version independent manner.

1.  The SNMP Management Framework

The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
components:

o An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [5].

o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
  purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
  Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16,
  RFC 1155 [6], STD 16, RFC 1212 [7] and RFC 1215 [8]. The second
  version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [9], STD 58,
  RFC 2579 [10] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [11].

o Message protocols for transferring management information.  The first
  version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in
  STD 15, RFC 1157 [12]. A second version of the SNMP message protocol,
  which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c
  and described in RFC 1901 [13] and RFC 1906 [14]. The third version of
  the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [14],
  RFC 2572 [15] and RFC 2574 [16].

o Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The first
  set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
  STD 15, RFC 1157 [12]. A second set of protocol operations and
  associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [17].

o A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [18] and the
  view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [19].

A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
can be found in RFC 2570 [20].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A MIB
conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
MIB.


2.  Revision History

Changes from draft-ops-rfc2013-update-00.txt

12 Jul 2001

     Turned into IPNG WG document

Changes from first draft posted to v6mib mailing list:

23 Feb 2001

     Made threshold for HC packet counters 1Mpps

     Added copyright statements and table of contents

21 Feb 2001 -- Juergen's changes

     Renamed udpInetTable to udpListenerTable

     Updated Conformance info

6 Feb 2001

     Removed v6-only objects.

     Removed remote and instance objects, turning the table back into a
     listener-only table.

     Renamed inetUdp* to udpInet*

     Added HC in and out datagram counters

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: January 2002                July 2001


     Added SIZE restriction to udpListenerLocalAddress.  (36 = 32-byte
     addresses plus 4-byte scope, but it's just a strawman)

     Used InetPortNumber TC from updated INET-ADDRESS-MIB

     Updated compliance statements.

     Added Keith to authors

     Added open issues section.

[optional] connection table to more fully specify sockets?

Per-connection/listener datagram / octet count objects in an optional
conformance group?

IPV6_V6ONLY?

7.  Security Considerations


There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB is
implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can alter
or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP SET
operations.

There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
sensitive information. These are:


o The udpListenerLocalPort and udpLocalPort objects can be used to
  identify what ports are open on the machine and can thus what attacks
  are likely to succeed, without the attacker having to run a port
  scanner.

It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
for such a secure environment.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
(read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the User-
based Security Model RFC 2574 [16] and the View-based Access Control
Model RFC 2575 [19] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give
access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
