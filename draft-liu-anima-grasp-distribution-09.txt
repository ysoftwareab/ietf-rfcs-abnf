            Information Distribution in Autonomic Networking
                 draft-liu-anima-grasp-distribution-09


Abstract

   This document discusses the requirement of capability of information
   distribution among autonomic nodes in autonomic networks. In general,
   information distribution can be categorized into two different modes:
   1) one autonomic node instantly sends information to other nodes in
   the domain; 2) one autonomic node can publish some information and
   then some other interested nodes can subscribe the published
   information. In the former case, information data will be generated
   and consumed instantly. In the latter case, however, information data
   shall be stored in the network and retrieved when necessary.

   These capabilities are fundamental and basic to a network system and
   an autonomic network infrastructure (ANI) should consider to
   integrate them, rather than assisted by other transport or routing
   protocols (HTTP, BGP/IGP as bearing protocols etc.).  Thus, this
   document clarifies possible use cases and requirements to ANI so that
   information distribution can be natively supported. Possible options
   to realize the information distribution function are also briefly
   discussed.

1  Introduction

   In an autonomic network, autonomic functions (AFs) running on
   autonomic nodes would exchange information constantly, both for
   controlling/management signaling and data exchange. This document
   discusses the information distribution capability of such exchange
   between AFs.  

   Scenarios of information distribution could be categorized into the
   following two basic models:

      1) Point-to-point (P2P) Communication: information are exchanged
      between two communicating parties from one node to another node.

      2) One-to-Many Communication: some information exchanges involve
      an information source and multiple receivers.

   The distribution approaches could also be categorized into two basic
   models:

      1) An instant communication: a sender connects and sends the
      information data (e.g. control/management signaling,
      synchronization data and so on) to the receiver(s) immediately. 

      2) An asynchronous communication: a sender saves the information
      in the network, may or may not publish the information to the
      other who is interested in the published information, to which a
      node asks to retrieve.

   The Autonomic Network Infrastructure (ANI) [I-D.ietf-anima-reference-
   model] should have provided a generic way to support these various
   scenarios, rather than assisted by other transport or routing
   protocols (HTTP, BGP/IGP as bearing protocols etc.). In fact, GRASP
   already provides part of the capabilities.

   In this document, we first analyze requirements of information
   distribution in autonomic networks (Section 3), and then introduce

INTERNET DRAFT      Information Distribution in ANI     October 22, 2018


   its relationship to the other modules in ANI (Section 4). After that,
   the node behaviors and extensions to the existing GRASP are
   introduced in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3. Requirements of Advanced Information Distribution

   If the information that will be exchanged is simple and short, this
   can be done instantly. In practice, however, this is not always the
   case. In the following cases, a mixture of instant and asynchronous
   communication models is more appropriate.

      1) Long Communication Intervals. The time interval of the
      communication is not necessarily always short and instant.
      Advanced AFs  may rather involve heavy jobs/tasks (e.g. database
      lookup, authentication etc.) when gearing the network, so the
      instant mode may introduce unnecessary pending time and become
      less efficient. If simply using an instant mode, the AF has to
      wait until the tasks finish and return. A better way is that an AF
      instantly sends the request but switches to an synchronous mode,
      once the jobs are finished, AFs will get notified.

      2) Common Interest Distribution. As mentioned, some information
      are common interests among AFs. For example, the network intent is
      distributed to network nodes enrolled, which is a typical one-to-
      many scenario. We can also finish the intent distribution by an
      instant flooding (e.g. via GRASP) to every network nodes across
      the network domain. Because of network dynamic, however, not every
      node can be just ready at the moment when the network intent is
      flooded. Actually, nodes may join in the network sequentially. In
      this situation, an asynchronous communication model could be a
      better choice where every (newly joining) node can subscribe the
      intent information and will get notified if it is ready (or
      updated).

      3) Distributed Coordination. With computing and storage resources
      on autonomic nodes, alive AFs not only consumes but also generates
      data information. For example, AFs coordinating with each other as
      distributed schedulers, responding to service requests and
      distributing tasks. It is critical for those AFs to make correct
      decisions based on local information, which might be asymmetric as
      well. AFs may also need synthetic/aggregated data information
      (e.g. statistic info, like average values of several AFs, etc.) to
 


Liu, et al.              Expires April 25, 2019                 [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT      Information Distribution in ANI     October 22, 2018


      make decisions. In these situations, AFs will need an efficient
      way to form a global view of the network (e.g. about resource
      consumption, bandwidth and statistics). Obviously, purely relying
      on instant communication model is inefficient, while a scalable,
      common, yet distributed data layer, on which AFs can store and
      share information in an asynchronous way, should be a better
      choice.

   For ANI, in order to support various communication scenarios, an
   information distribution module is required, and both instant and
   asynchronous communication models should be supported.

4. Information Distribution in ANI

   This section describes how the information distribution module fits
   into the ANI of ANIMA, as well as what extensions are proposed
   against GRASP.

   Figure 1. Information Distribution Module and GRASP Extension.

   As the Fig 1 shows, the information distribution module includes
   three sub-modules, all of which provides APIs for ASAs. Specific
   behaviors of these modules is described in Section 5. In order to
   support the modules, the GRASP is also extended, which is described
   in Section 6.

5. Node Behaviors

INTERNET DRAFT      Information Distribution in ANI     October 22, 2018


   In this section, we discuss how each autonomic node should behave in
   order to realize the information distribution module. In other words,
   we discuss the node requirement if an information distribution module
   is required across the ANI. Supporting the two communication models
   that may happen in the ANI necessarily involves node interactions and
   information data exchange. Specifically, we first introduce the node
   requirement for the instant communication model, and after that we
   introduce the node requirement for the asynchronous communication
   model.

5.1 Instant Information Distribution

   In this case, sender(s) and receiver(s) are explicitly and
   immediately specified (e.g. the addresses of the receivers).
   Information will be directly sent from the sender(s) to the
   receiver(s). This requires that every node is equipped by some
   signaling/transport protocols so that they can coordinate with each
   other and correctly deliver the information. 

5.1.1 Instant P2P and Flooding Communications

   We consider that current GRASP already provides some of the instant
   P2P and flooding communications capabilities.

   Straightforwardly, it is natural to use the GRASP Synchronization
   message directly for P2P distribution. Furthermore, it is also
   natural to use the GRASP Flood Synchronization message for 1-to-all
   distribution.

   However, as mentioned in Section 3, in some scenarios one node needs
   to actively send some information to another. GRASP Synchronization
   just lacks such capability. An un-solicited synchronization mechanism
   is needed. A relevant GRASP extension is defined in Section 6.

5.1.2 Instant Selective Flooding Communication

   When doing selective flooding, the distributed information needs to
   contain the criteria for nodes to judge which interfaces should be
   sent the distributed information and which are not. Specifically, the
   criteria contain:

      o  Matching condition: a set of matching rules.

      o  Matching object: the object that the match condition would be
      applied to.  For example, the matching object could be node itself
      or its neighbors.

      o  Action: what behavior the node needs to do when the matching

INTERNET DRAFT      Information Distribution in ANI     October 22, 2018


      object matches or failed the matching condition.  For example, the
      action could be forwarding or discarding the distributed message.

   The sender has to includes the criteria information in the message
   that carries the distributed information. The receiving node decides
   the action according to the criteria carried in the message. Still
   considering the criteria attached with the distributed information,
   the node behaviors can be:

      o When the Matching Object is "Neighbors", then the node matches
      the relevant information of its neighbors to the Matching
      Condition.  If the node finds one neighbor matches the Matching
      Condition, then it forwards the distributed message to the
      neighbor.  If not, the node discards forwarding the message to the
      neighbor.

      o When the Matching Object is the node itself, then the node
      matches the relevant information of its own to the Matching
      Condition.  If the node finds itself matches the Matching
      Condition, then it forwards the distributed message to its
      neighbors; if not, the node discards forwarding the message to the
      neighbors.

   An example of selective flooding is briefly described in the Appendix
   A.

5.2 Asynchronous Information Distribution

   Asynchronous information distribution happens in a different way
   where sender(s) and receiver(s) are normally not immediately
   specified. In other words, both the sender and the receiver may come
   up in an asynchronous way. First of all, this requires that the
   information can be stored; secondly, it requires an information
   publication and subscription (Pub/Sub) mechanism. (Corresponding
   protocol specification of Pub/Sub is defined in Section 6.)


   As we sketched in the previous section, in general, each node
   requires two modules: 1) Information Storage (IS) module and 2) Event
   Queue (EQ) module. 1. These two modules should be integrated with the
   information distribution module. We introduce details of the two
   modules in the following sections.

5.2.1 Information Storage

   IS module handles how to save and retrieve information for ASAs
   across the network. The IS module uses a syntax to index information,
   not only generating the hash index value (e.g. a key) for the
 


Liu, et al.              Expires April 25, 2019                 [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT      Information Distribution in ANI     October 22, 2018


   information, but also mapping the hash index to a certain ANIMA node
   in ANI. Note that, this mechanism can use existing solutions.
   Specifically, storing information in an ANIMA network will be
   realized in the following steps.

      1) ASA-to-IS Negotiation. An ASA calls the API provided by
      information distribution module (directly supported by IS sub-
      module) to request to store the information somewhere in the
      network. Such a request will be checked by the IS module who will
      response the request from the ASA whether such a request is
      feasible according to criteria such as permitted information size.

      2) Destination Node Mapping. The information block will be handled
      by the IS module in order to calculate/map to a destination node
      in the network. Since ANIMA network is a peer-to-peer network, a
      typical way is to use dynamic hash table (DHT) to map information
      to a unique index identifier. For example, if the size of the
      information is reasonable, the information block itself can be
      hashed, otherwise, some meta-data of the information block can be
      used to generate the mapping.

      3) Destination Node Negotiation Request. Negotiation request of
      storing the information will be sent from the IS module to the IS
      module on the destination node. The negotiation request contains
      parameters about the information block from the source IS module.
      According to the parameters as well as the local available
      resource, the destination node will feedback the source IS module.

      4) Destination Node Negotiation Response. Negotiation response
      from the destination node is sent back to the source IS module. If
      the source IS module gets confirmation that the information can be
      stored, source IS module will prepare to transfer the information
      block; otherwise, a new destination node must be discovered (i.e.
      going to step 7).

      5) Information Block Transfer. Before sending the information
      block to the destination node that accepts the request, the IS
      module of the source node will check if the information block can
      be afforded by one GRASP message. If so, the information block
      will be directly sent by calling a GRASP API. Otherwise, bulk data
      transmission with GRASP will be triggered, where multi-time GRASP
      message sending will be used so that one information block will be
      transferred by smaller pieces [I-D.ietf-anima-reference-model].

      6) Information Writing. Once the information block (or a smaller
      block) is received, the IS module of the destination node will
      store the data block in the local storage, which is accessible.

INTERNET DRAFT      Information Distribution in ANI     October 22, 2018


      7) (Optional) New Destination Node Discovery. If the previously
      selected destination node is not available to store the
      information block, the source IS module will have to identify a
      new destination node to start a new negotiation. In this case, the
      discovery can be done by using discovery GRASP API to identify a
      new candidate, or more complex mechanisms can be introduced.

   Similarly, Getting information from an ANIMA network will be realized
   in the following steps.

      1) ASA-to-IS Request. An ASA accesses the IS module via the APIs
      exposed by the information distribution module. The key/index of
      the interested information will be sent to the IS module. An
      assumption here is that the key/index should be ready to an ASA
      before an ASA can ask for the information. This relates to the
      publishing/subscribing of the information, which are handled by
      other modules (e.g. Event Queue with Pub/Sub supported by GRASP).

      2) Destination Node Mapping. IS module maps the key/index of the
      requested information to a destination node, and prepares to start
      to request the information. The mapping here follows the same
      mechanism when the information is stored.

      3) Retrieval Negotiation Request. The source IS module sends a
      request to the destination node identified in the previous step
      and asks if such an information object is available.

      4) Retrieval Negotiation Response. The destination node checks the
      key/index of the requested information, and replies to the source
      IS module. If the information is found and the information block
      can be afforded within one GRASP message, the information will be
      sent together with the response to the source IS module.

      5) (Optional) New Destination Request. If the information is not
      found after the source IS module gets the response from the
      original destination node, the source IS module will have to
      discover where the location storing the requested information is.


   IS module can reuse distributed databases and key value stores like
   NoSQL, Cassandra, DHT technologies. storage and retrieval of
   information are all event-driven responsible by the EQ module.

5.2.2 Event Queue

   Event Queue (EQ) module is responsible for event classification,
   event prioritization and event matching. 

 


Liu, et al.              Expires April 25, 2019                 [Page 9]

INTERNET DRAFT      Information Distribution in ANI     October 22, 2018


   Firstly, EQ module provides isolated event queues customized for
   different event groups. Specifically, two groups of AFs could have
   completely different purposes or interests, therefore EQ
   classification allows to create multiple message queues where only
   AFs interested in the same category of events will be aware of the
   corresponding event queue.

   Secondly, events generated may have to be processed with different
   priorities. Some of them are more urgent than the normal and regular
   ones. Also between two event queues, their priorities may be
   different. EQ prioritization allows AFs to set different priorities
   on the information they published. Based on the priority settings in
   the event queue, matching and delivery of them will be adjusted. EQ
   module can provide several pre-defined priority levels for both
   intra-queue and inter-queue prioritizations.

   Third, events in queues will be listened and if a publishing event is
   found and matched by a registration event, information retrieval will
   be triggered.


5.2.3 Interface between IS and EQ Modules

   EQ and IS modules are correlated. When an AF publishes information,
   not only an publishing event is translated and sent to EQ module, but
   also the information is indexed and stored simultaneously. Similarly,
   when an AF subscribes information, not only subscribing event is
   triggered and sent to EQ module, but also the information will be
   retrieved by IS module at the same time.

5.3 Summary

   In summary, the general requirements for the information distribution
   module on each autonomic node are two sub-modules handling instant
   communications and asynchronous communications, respectively. For
   instant communications, node requirements are simple, in which
   signaling protocols have to be supported. With minimum efforts,
   reusing the existing GRASP is possible. For asynchronous
   communications, information distribution module requires event queue
   and information storage mechanism to be supported.

6. Protocol Specification (GRASP extension)

   There are multiple ways to integrate the information distribution
   module. The principle we follow is to minimize modifications made to
   the current ANI. 

   We consider to use GRASP as an interface to access the information

   distribution module. The main reason is that the current version of
   GRASP is already an information distribution module for the cases of
   P2P and flooding. In the following discussions, we introduce how to
   complete the missing part.

6.1 Un-solicited Synchronization Message (A new GRASP Message)

   In fragmentary CDDL, a Un-solicited Synchronization message follows
   the pattern:

      unsolicited_synch-message = [M_UNSOLDSYNCH, session-id, objective]

   A node MAY actively send a unicast Un-solicited Synchronization
   message with the Synchronization data, to another node. This MAY be
   sent to port GRASP_LISTEN_PORT at the destination address, which
   might be obtained by GRASP Discovery or other possible ways. The
   synchronization data are in the form of GRASP Option(s) for specific
   synchronization objective(s). 

6.2 Selective Flooding Option

   In fragmentary CDDL, the selective flood follows the pattern:

      selective-flood-option = [O_SELECTIVE_FLOOD, +O_MATCH-CONDITION,  
                                match-object, action]
      O_MATCH-CONDITION = [O_MATCH-CONDITION, Obj1, match-rule, Obj2]
         Obj1 = text 
         match-rule = GREATER / LESS / WITHIN / CONTAIN
         Obj2 = text
      match-object = NEIGHBOR / SELF
      action = FORWARD / DROP

   The selective flood option encapsulates a match-condition option
   which represents the conditions regarding to continue or discontinue
   flood the current message. For the match-condition option, the Obj1
   and Obj2 are to objects that need to be compared. For example, the
   Obj1 could be the role of the device and Obj2 could be "RSG". The
   match rules between the two objects could be greater, less than,
   within, or contain. The match-object represents of which Obj1 belongs
   to, it could be the device itself or the neighbor(s) intended to be
   flooded. The action means, when the match rule applies, the current
   device just continues flood or discontinues.

6.3 Subscription Objective Option

   In fragmentary CDDL, a Subscription Objective Option follows the
   pattern:

INTERNET DRAFT      Information Distribution in ANI     October 22, 2018


      subscription-objection-option = [SUBSCRIPTION, 2, 2, subobj]
      objective-name = SUBSCRIPTION
      objective-flags = 2
      loop-count = 2
      subobj = text

   This option MAY be included in GRASP M_Synchronization, when
   included, it means this message is for a subscription to a specific
   object.

6.4 Un_Subscription Objective Option

   In fragmentary CDDL, a Un_Subscribe Objective Option follows the
   pattern:

      Unsubscribe-objection-option = [UNSUBSCRIB, 2, 2, unsubobj]
      objective-name = SUBSCRIPTION
      objective-flags = 2
      loop-count = 2
      unsubobj = text

   This option MAY be included in GRASP M_Synchronization, when
   included, it means this message is for a un-subscription to a
   specific object. 

6.5 Publishing Objective Option

   In fragmentary CDDL, a Publish Objective Option follows the pattern:

      publish-objection-option = [PUBLISH, 2, 2, pubobj] objective-name
      = PUBLISH
      objective-flags = 2
      loop-count = 2
      pubobj = text

   This option MAY be included in GRASP M_Synchronization, when
   included, it means this message is for a publish of a specific object
   data.

   Note that extended GRASP messages with new arguments inside here will
   trigger interactions/actions of the underlying information
   distribution module introduced in Section 5.

7. Security Considerations

   The distribution source authentication could be done at multiple
   layers:

      o  Outer layer authentication: the GRASP communication is within
      ACP (Autonomic Control Plane,
      [I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane]). This is the default
      GRASP behavior.

      o  Inner layer authentication: the GRASP communication might not
      be within a protected channel, then there should be embedded
      protection in distribution information itself. Public key
      infrastructure might be involved in this case.

8. IANA Considerations

   TBD.

   Appendix A  Real-world Use Cases of Information Distribution

   The requirement analysis in Section 3 shows that generally
   information distribution should be better of as an infrastructure
   layer module, which provides to upper layer utilizations. In this
   section, we review some use cases from the real-world where an
   information distribution module with powerful functions do plays a
   critical role there.

   A.1 Service-Based Architecture (SBA) in 3GPP 5G

   In addition to Internet, the telecommunication network (i.e. carrier
   mobile wireless networks) is another world-wide networking system.
   The architecture of the upcoming 5G mobile networks from 3GPP has
   already been defined to follow a service-based architecture (SBA)
   where any network function (NF) can be dynamically associated with
   any other NF(s) when needed to compose a network service. Note that
   one NF can simultaneously associate with multiple other NFs, instead
   of being physically wired as in the previous generations of mobile
   networks. NFs communicate with each other over service-based
   interface (SBI), which is also standardized by 3GPP [3GPP.23.501].

   In order to realize an SBA network system, detailed requirements are
   further defined to specify how NFs should interact with each other
   with information exchange over the SBI. We now list three
   requirements that are related to information distribution here.

      1) NF Pub/Sub: Any NF should be able to expose its service status
      to the network and any NF should be able to subscribe the service
      status of an NF and get notified if the status is available. An
      concrete example is that a session management function (SMF) can
      subscribe the REGISTER notification from an access management
      function (AMF) if there is a new user entity trying to access the
      mobile network [3GPP.23.502].

      2) Network Exposure Function (NEF): A particular network function
      that is required to manage the event exposure and distributions.
      In specific, SBA requires such a functionality to register network
      events from the other NFs (e.g. AMF, SMF and so on), classify the
      events and properly handle event distributions accordingly in
 


Liu, et al.              Expires April 25, 2019                [Page 16]

INTERNET DRAFT      Information Distribution in ANI     October 22, 2018


      terms of different criteria (e.g. priorities) [3GPP.23.502].

      3) Network Repository Function (NRF): A particular network
      function where all service status information is stored for the
      whole network. An SBA network system requires all NFs to be
      stateless so as to improve the resilience as well as agility of
      providing network services. Therefore, the information of the
      available NFs and the service status generated by those NFs will
      be globally stored in NRF as a repository of the system. This
      clearly implies storage capability that keeps the information in
      the network and provides those information when needed. A concrete
      example is that whenever a new NF comes up, it first of all
      registers itself at NRF with its profile. When a network service
      requires a certain NF, it first inquires NRF to retrieve the
      availability information and decides whether or not there is an
      available NF or a new NF must be instantiated [3GPP.23.502].

   (Note: 3GPP CT might finally adopt HTTP2.0/JSON to be the protocol
   communicating between NFs, but autonomic networks can also load
   HTTP2.0 with in ACP.)

   A.2 Vehicle-to-Everything

   Carrier networks On-boarding services of vertical industries are also
   one of some blooming topics that are heavily discussed. Connected car
   is clearly one of the important scenarios interested in automotive
   manufacturers, carriers and vendors. 5G Automotive Alliance - an
   industry collaboration organization defines many promising use cases
   where services from car industry should be supported by the 5G mobile
   network. Here we list two examples as follows [5GAA.use.cases].

      1) Software/Firmware Update: Car manufacturers expect that the
      software/firmware of their car products can be remotely
      updated/upgraded via 5G network in future, instead of onsite
      visiting their 4S stores/dealers offline as nowadays. This
      requires the network to provide a mechanism for vehicles to
      receive the latest software updates during a certain period of
      time. In order to run such a service for a car manufacturer, the
      network shall not be just like a network pipe anymore. Instead,
      information data have to be stored in the network, and delivered
      in a publishing/subscribing fashion. For example, the latest
      release of a software will be first distributed and stored at the
      access edges of the mobile network, after that, the updates can be
      pushed by the car manufacturer or pulled by the car owner as
      needed.

      2) Real-time HD Maps: Autonomous driving clearly requires much
      finer details of road maps. Finer details not only include the

INTERNET DRAFT      Information Distribution in ANI     October 22, 2018


      details of just static road and streets, but also real-time
      information on the road as well as the driving area for both local
      urgent situations and intelligent driving scheduling. This asks
      for situational awareness at critical road segments in cases of
      changing road conditions. Clearly, a huge amount of traffic data
      that are real-time collected will have to be stored and shared
      across the network. This clearly requires the storage capability,
      data synchronization and event notifications in urgent cases from
      the network, which are still missing at the infrastructure layer.

   A.3 Summary

   Through the general analysis and the concrete examples from the real-
   world, we realize that the ways information are exchanged in the
   coming new scenarios are not just short and instant anymore. More
   advanced as well as diverse information distribution capabilities are
   required and should be generically supported from the infrastructure
   layer. Upper layer applications (e.g. ASAs in ANIMA) access and
   utilize such a unified mechanism for their own services.
