Abstract
   
   The RADIUS Accounting document [1] defines a mechanism which is used
   by a Network Access Server (NAS) to send accounting information to a 
   RADIUS server. The current protocol defines a Start and Stop record.
   This document defines an interim record which is used to make the
   RADIUS accounting protocol more robust.
     
1.0 Introduction
   
   The current protocol defines a message which a NAS sends to the RADIUS
   server when a session begins, and a message when the session ends. 
   All information which is necessary for the billing process

   (i.e. session time, number of bytes transfered, etc) are only 
   available in the Accounting Stop message. Therefore if a NAS becomes
   unavailable for some time (i.e. power failure, reboot, network 
   problem, etc...) it becomes impossible for a service provider to bill
   for sessions initiated on the NAS (this is especially important with 
   long lived sessions).

   This document introduces a new accounting message which is sent from
   NAS to the RADIUS server which is called the interim accounting 
   message. This message is sent in order to periodically update the
   RADIUS server with information pertaining to a specific session. 

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.

   MUST      This word, or the adjective "required", means that the
             definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.

   MUST NOT  This phrase means that the definition is an absolute
             prohibition of the specification.

   SHOULD    This word, or the adjective "recommended", means that there
             may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to
             ignore this item, but the full implications must be
             understood and carefully weighed before choosing a
             different course.

   MAY       This word, or the adjective "optional", means that this
             item is one of an allowed set of alternatives.  An
             implementation which does not include this option MUST be
             prepared to interoperate with another implementation which
             does include the option.


2.  Operation

   When a session is initiated, a NAS issues a RADIUS Start Accounting 
   Request. The RADIUS Server processes the request and issues a 
   response. However, if the RADIUS Server wishes to receive interim 
   accounting information it needs to add a new RADIUS Attribute defined
   below which indicates the interval in seconds between interim 
   messages.

   This scheme does not break backward interoperability since a RADIUS
   server not supporting this extension will simply not add the new 
   Attribute. On the other hand, NAS' not supporting this extension 
   will simply ignore the Attribute. This means that if a RADIUS 
   Server uses the interim extension for other purposes 
   (i.e. resource management) it MUST be aware of NAS' which do not 
   support this extension.

   Note that all information in an interim message is cumulative (i.e. 
   number of packets sent is the total since the beginning of the 
   session, not since the last interim message).

   It is envisioned that an Interim Accounting record would contain
   all of the attributes normally found in an Accounting Stop message
   with the exception of the Acct-Term-Cause attribute.

   Since accounting packets are modified when retransmissions occur, it
   is recommended that the interval time restart only once the response 
   from the RADIUS Server has been received (making sure that interim 
   updates are not sent while retransmissions are pendig for a given 
   session). A NAS COULD divide the interval time with the maximum 
   number of retranmissions configured locally in order to determine the
   retransmission mechanism.

   Although this extension allows control from a central RADIUS Server,
   the authors wish to caution against using low interval values (i.e.
   5 seconds). In a NAS with large port densities, it can becomes a 
   CPU intensive task as well as a waste of network bandwidth.


3.  Attributes

   This section defines the new RADIUS Attributes necessary to support
   the Interim Accounting extension.

3.1.  Acct-Status-Type

   Description

      This attribute indicates whether this Accounting-Request marks the
      beginning of the user service (Start) or the end (Stop).

      It MAY be used by the client to mark the start of accounting (for
      example, upon booting) by specifying Accounting-On and to mark the
      end of accounting (for example, just before a scheduled reboot) by
      specifying Accounting-Off.

      Additionally this attribute MAY indicate an interim update.

   A summary of the Acct-Status-Type attribute format is shown below.
   The fields are transmitted from left to right.

       7      Accounting-On
       8      Accounting-Off

3.2.  Acct-Interim-Interval

   Description

      This attribute indicates the number of seconds between each interim
	  update in seconds for this specific session.

   A summary of the Acct-Interim-Interval attribute format is shown
