Abstract

   Most of MANET address autoconfiguration mechanisms introduce
   significant load like message flooding, or are dependent on the
   underlying routing protocols. This document proposes a new mechanism
   that is intended to minimize these drawbacks.  It is also designed to
   be applicable for hybrid MANET, where a MANET is connected to
   Internet through one or more MANET border routers.

1. Introduction

   Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) is a self-organized network by wireless
   mobile nodes(MNs), without any pre-installed infrastructure.  Its
   topology is frequently changed due to the MNs' mobility.  Therefore,
   it is necessary to configure their addresses automatically.

   "Hybrid MANET" is a mobile ad hoc network that has connectivity to
   other networks, like the Internet.  The connectivity is provided by
   special MN called `MANET Border Router'.  If MNs want to communicate
   with nodes on the external networks, the configured addresses must be
   globally unique.

   Recently, several solutions have been proposed to autoconfigure
   addresses to MNs [9].  Most of solutions exploit either an
   independent algorithm and messages [5] or a mechanism combined with
   underlying MANET routing protocol [6].  But they still have some
   drawbacks.  First, they introduce significant load like message full-
   flooding over a MANET.  Second, they are coupled with the routig
   protocol and have more complex structure.

   This document describes a mechanism of address autoconfiguration for
   a hybrid MANET, called `Hybrid MANET Address Autoconfiguration'
   (HAA).  The mechanism is intended to minimize message full-flooding.
   HAA autoconfigures IPv6 addresses to MNs by using IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery Protocol (NDP) [2-3] with some options and messages newly
   defined here.  After this autoconfiguration process, each MN has two
   types of addresses: MANET-local address and global-scope address.

2. Terminology

   Some of the terminology was borrowed from MANET architecuture I-D
   [13].

   MANET Node (MN)

      A MANET node includes a MANET router and zero or more hosts.

   MANET Router (MR)

      An entity that engages in a MANET routing protocol.

   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)

      A process determining the uniqueness of an address to be
      configured.  If any MN has already used the same address, the MN
      that has performed DAD process must select another address and
      then execute DAD process again.

   Hybrid MANET

      A MANET with a connection to the Internet is refered to as a
      hybrid MANET.  Such a connectivity is provided by one or more
      MANET Border Routers (MBRs).  Every MN in hybrid MANET can have
      multiple addresses to be accessible to variable scope of networks.

   MANET-local Address

      An address used in MANET-scope communications.  MBRs do not
      forward the packets that have MANET-local addresses as their
      destination addresses.  Unique local IPv6 unicast addresses (ULA)
      [10] can be used easily as MANET-local addresses.

   Global-scope Address

      An address used in MANET- and global-scope communications.  The
      general format of IPv6 global-scope addresses is defined in IPv6
      Address Architecture [11].  With this type of addresses, every MN
      in hybrid MANET can access to another MN in the MANET and to any
      host in the Internet.

   Hybrid MANET Address Autoconfiguration (HAA)

      The mechanism that configures MANET-local address and global-scope
      address to the MN in a MANET.  Because each MN has the information
      about MBR and the MBR maintains the information of MNs, MANET-wide
      message broadcasting can be avoided.

   MANET Border Router (MBR)

      A router that participates in multiple routing domains.  It
      provides MANET with network connectivity to other networks, like
      the Internet.  MBR also performs MANET-scope DAD, and allocates
      global-scope addresses to the MNs.

   Default Node (DN)

      If a MN has one or more HAA messages to be delivered to
      corresponding MBR, the MN direct all messages to `Default Node'.
      Only one of the MN's neighbors can be a default node.  This DN
      information is independent of any routing protocol.

   HAA Path

      If a MN wants to exchange address autoconfiguration messages with
      its corresponding MBR, the MN sends the message to its default
      node, one of its one-hop neighbors.  The next hop MN then forwards
      this message to its default node repeatedly.  As a result, the
      message is delivered to the MBR.  `HAA path' is the chain of
      default nodes among the MBR and the MNs. HAA path is regarded as a
      tree path that has MBR as its root.

   NDP Global Address Solicitation (GS)

      This is a newly defined message here to deliver each MN's request
      for the allocation of global-scope address and MANET-scope DAD.

   NDP Global Address Advertisement (GA)

      This is a newly defined message here to deliver MBR's response of
      each MN's GS message.  This contains the information about global-
      scope address to be allocated, or an error if necessary.

3. IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration for Hybrid MANETs

3.1. Link-local DAD

   If a new MN A joins a MANET, the MN A makes its own link-local scope
   address, and then determines the duplication of the address.  To
   detect address duplication, the MN A broadcasts NDP `Neighbor
   Solicitation (NS)' message to all of 1-hop neighbors.  If there is
   not any NDP `Neighbor Advertisement (NA)' message for a period of
   time, the MN A uses the link-local scope address to get a global-
   scope address.

   If there are one or more NDP NA messages, the MN A makes a new link-
   local scope address with a 64-bit long random value as a MN ID
   according to IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SAA) [3].
   Then the MN A retries the link-local DAD by sending again a NDP NS
   message containing the new link-local address.

3.2. Default Node Selection

   If a newly joined MN A fixes its link-local address, then it tries to
   get the information about the MBR and default node.  For this, the MN
   A sends NDP `Router Solicitation (RS)' message to all of 1-hop
   neighbors.

   Each neighbor that receives the MN A's RS message responses with NDP
   `Router Advertisement (RA)' message like a router of wired networks.
   In this RA message, a newly defined 'Default Node' option is
   attached.  This option containes the addresses of MBR and default
   node (e.g. the sender of this message), the path length measured in
   hop counts between the MBR and the default node, and the lifetime of
   the information about default node.

   The MN A then receives one or more RA messages.  It selects one among
   these messages by searching the address of MBR and hop counts.  For
   example, if MN B, C, and D send RA messages and the MN B's RA message
   has the shortest hop counts to the corresponding MBR, the MN A
   selects the RA message generated by the MN B.

   If there is no RA message during a period of T_WAIT_RA seconds, then
   the MN A retries to send RS message.  If there is still no RS message
   during N_RETRY_RS times retrial, then the MN A stops HAA process.

3.3. HAA path

   If the MN A gets the addresses of MBR and default node, it
   participates in `HAA path'.  At the begining of building a hybrid
   MANET, there is one MN that is MBR as infrastructure providing
   Internet connectivity.  When there is not any MN except MBR, a newly
   joined MN does DAD with MBR and gets the MBR's address as a default
   node.  As the following MNs are joined, each of MNs takes the former
   MN's address as a default node.  As a result, HAA path becomes a tree
   path that has MBR as its root.

   The HAA path is used for the porpose of address autoconfiguration
   only.  Each MN's path toward MBR is independent of any routing
   protocol, but this HAA path infomation can be used by a routing
   protocol if needed.

3.4. MANET-scope DAD and Global-scope Address Configuration

   Once a MN A acquires the information about MBR and default node, it
   can request the allocation of global-scope address by sending `Global
   Solicitation (GS)' message to MBR.  GS message is newly defined here
   as an extension to IPv6 NDP.  This message has the `Node Address'
   option that contains the address of the MN A.  GS message is
   forwarded to the default node of each MN repeatedly, along the HAA
   path.

   If the HAA path contains the loop by the mobility of some MNs, GS
   message will be silently dropped when its hop limit is decreased to
   0.  Then the MN can detect the loop, and change or remove the invalid
   default node.  If the loop is created in transient, the loop path is
   fixed before the GS message's hop limit becomes 0.

   If MBR receives the NDP GS message, then it performs MANET-scope DAD
   by comparing the MN A's address contained in GS message to the
   addresses from the list of registered MNs.

   If there is no duplicate address used by the MN A's, then MBR sends
   NDP `Global Advertisement (GA)' message.  This message is defined as
   an extension to NDP like GS message.  It contains the global-scope
   address to be allocated to the MN A, and the length of prefix of its
   address.  If the MN A receives the message, then the MN sets its
   address to the global-scope address.

Internet-Draft                     HAA                        March 2007


   If an address duplication is detected, then MBR sends the global-
   scope address allocation error message instead.  This message uses
   the form of NDP GA message, but sets bit E to 1.  If the MN A
   receives that, it generates a new address and try again.

   Both GS and GA messages traverse along HAA path and are unicast
   messages.  And message broadcasts are limited to 1-hop range, so the
   message overhead due to the HAA mechanism is relatively low.

3.5. Autoconfiguration without MBR

   A MANET can lose its MBR if all MNs of the MANET are moved out of the
   radio range of the MBR.  By the absence of the MBR, allocation of
   global-scope address and its DAD procedure, and Internet connectivity
   become unavailable.  If any MN in the MANET cannot receive periodical
   GA messages from the MBR, it stops the use of its global-scope
   addresses and disconnects the sessions that were created using
   global-scope addresses previously.  In contrary, the MN keeps its own
   MANET-local address.  Abitrary MNs can join to and leave from MBR-
   less MANET, so periodical DAD process for MANET-local address is
   required.  But MANET-local addresses use the format of Unique local
   address (ULA), that is combined with pre-defined prefix for MANET and
   interface identifier built from EUI-64.  Hence, optimistic DAD [12]
   can be used for the check of duplication of MANET-local addresses.

5. Security Considerations

   This document does not describe any security facility of the hybrid
   address autoconfiguration.  A malicious MN may block the process by
   misdirecting some of the HAA messages, or make a newly joined MN con-
   figure its address with invalid information.
