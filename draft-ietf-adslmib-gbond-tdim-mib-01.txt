Internet-Draft               G.Bond/TDIM MIB               November 2007


1.  Introduction

   The Multi-pair bonding using time-division inverse multiplexing
   (TDIM), a.k.a.  G.Bond/TDIM, is specified in ITU-T G.998.3
   recommendation [G.998.3], which defines a method for bonding (or
   aggregating) of multiple xDSL lines into a single bi-directional
   logical link, carrying a mix of various traffic streams, e.g.
   Ethernet, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Time-Division
   Multiplexing (TDM).

   The MIB module, defined in this document, provides G.Bond/TDIM
   specific objects for the management of G.998.3 bonded interfaces,
   extending the common bonding objects specified in GBOND-MIB
   [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib] module.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The DSL Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding

   This document makes use of the DSL Forum technical report Management
   Framework for xDSL Bonding [WT-159], defining a management model and
   a hierarchy of management objects for the bonded xDSL interfaces.

4.  Relationship to other MIB modules

   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: Interfaces
   Group MIB (IF-MIB) and G.Bond MIB (GBOND-MIB).

Internet-Draft               G.Bond/TDIM MIB               November 2007


4.1.  Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB module

   A G.Bond/TDIM port is a private case of a Bonded multi-pair xDSL
   interface and as such is managed using generic interface management
   objects defined in the IF-MIB [RFC2863].  In particular an interface
   index (ifIndex) is used to index instances of G.Bond/TDIM ports in a
   system.

4.2.  Relationship to G.Bond MIB module

   GBOND-MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib] module defines management
   objects common for all Bonded multi-pair xDSL interfaces.  In
   particular is describes the bonding management, port and channel
   configuration, initialization sequence etc.

   Both GBOND-MIB and GBOND-TDIM-MIB modules are REQUIRED to manage a
   G.Bond/TDIM port.

4.3.  Relationship to Other MIB modules

   _EdNote: Add here services layering model and MIBs for ATM, Ethernet
   and TDM services. _

5.  MIB Structure

5.1.  Overview

   _EdNote: TBC... _

5.1.1.  TODO/Open Issues

   o  Peformance Monitoring counters

5.2.  Protection Configuration

   G.Bond/TDIM specification allows an optional Forward Error Correction
   (FEC) and Interleaver block, which, if supported and enabled,
   provides a degree of protection against micro-interruptions, alien
   noise, and even individual Bonding Channel Entity (BCE) failures,
   a.k.a. cut-line protection.

   Management objects in the gBondTdimPortConfTable can be used to
   configure and quiery the FEC and Interleaver function of the G.Bond/
   TDIM port.

5.3.  Service Configuration

   Unlike the other two xDSL Multi-Pair Bonding schemes (G.Bond/ATM and
   G.Bond/Ethernet), which send the information required for reassembly
   of the fragmented data along with the data, G.Bond/TDIM is a
   synchronous scheme, requiring both ends to know the data distribution
   tables before any actual data transfer can happen.

   Management objects in the gBondTdimServiceTable can be used to
   configure and quiery the configuration of services transported via
   the G.Bond/TDIM link.  The services may be configured when the link
   is down prior to the link's initialization.  The sum of all the
   services' bandwidth SHOULD be less or equal to the target data rate
   of the bonded link.  Note that G.Bond/TDIM links are symmetrical,
   i.e. their upstream data rate equals to the downstream data rate.

5.3.1.  Management of TDM Services

   G.Bond/TDIM protocol provides an ability to map TDM services into the
   TDIM bonded link directly, without any additional overhead.  It
   addresses only structure-agnostic TDM transport, disregarding any
   structure that may be imposed on these streams, in particular the
   structure imposed by the standard TDM framing [G.704].

   _EdNote: Describe service allocation + conection with IfIndex of the
   service ports, prioritization and notifications.  Should we allow
   dynamic service assignment while the G.Bond/TDIM link is up?  Think
   about Performance Monitoring for services.  Think about common things
   between G.Bond/TDIM and PWE3, may be there's a potential for reuse,
   see PW-*-MIB modules in
   http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/pwe3-charter.html _

   (attributes) defined in [G.998.3] and managed objects defined in this

7.  Security Considerations

   There is a number of managed objects defined in the GBOND-TDIM-MIB
   module that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create.
   Most objects are writeable only when the link is down.  Writing to
   these objects can have potentially disruptive effects on network
   operation, for example:

   o  Changing of gBondTdimServiceTable configuration paratemers (e.g.
      gBondTdimServiceType or gBondTdimServiceSize) MAY lead to a
      potential service impairment, for example a TDM service would be
      dropped if there is not enough actual bandwidth on the bonded link
      to support this service.

   o  Changing of gBondTdimPortConfTable configuration parameters (e.g.
      gBondTdimFecAdminState) MAY lead to anything from link quality and
      rate degradation to a complete link initialization failure.

   The user of the GBOND-TDIM-MIB module must therefore be aware that
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The readable objects in the GBOND-TDIM-MIB module (i.e., those with
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in
   some environments since, collectively, they provide information about
   the performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
   their configuration.

   In such environments it is important to control also GET and NOTIFY
   access to these objects and possibly even to encrypt their values
   when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to

   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   An object identifier for gBondTdimMIB MODULE-IDENTITY SHALL be
   allocated by IANA in the MIB-2 transmission sub-tree, before this
