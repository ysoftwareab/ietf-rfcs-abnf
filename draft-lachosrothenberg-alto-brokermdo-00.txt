         ALTO-based Broker-assisted Multi-domain Orchestration
                draft-lachosrothenberg-alto-brokermdo-00

Abstract

   Evolving networking scenarios (e.g., 5G) demand new multiple
   administrative domain (aka multi-domain) orchestration models.  This
   document proposes the use of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
   (ALTO) services to offer topology and resources addressing network
   service discovery and provisioning by multi-domain orchestrators.
   The ALTO services with the proposed protocol extensions offer
   aggregated views on various types of resources contributing to a more
   simple and scalable solution for resource and service discovery in
   multi-domain, multi-technology environments.

1.  Introduction

   Envisioned 5G network architectures and related service models
   consider broader cooperation between stakeholders in order to provide
   flexible multi-operator multi-domain services.  These multi-provider
   orchestration operations will require the information exchange across
   Multi-domain Orchestrators (MdOs).  The key information to be

Internet-Draft    ALTO-based Multi-domain Orchestration       March 2018


   exchanged between MdOs includes the abstract network topology,
   resource availability (e.g., CPUs, Memory, and Storage) and
   capability (e.g., supported network functions).

   This document presents a federation networking paradigm where a
   broker-plane works on top of the management and orchestration plane
   to assist and coordinate the creation of an End-to-End Network
   Service (E2ENS) spanning over multi-operator multi-domain networks.
   Our design resorts to the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
   (ALTO) protocol  [RFC7285] to address the lack of abstractions to
   discover and adequately represent in confidentiality-preserving
   fashion the resource and topology information from different
   administrative domains.  Moreover, this draft introduces some
   extensions to the ALTO base protocol to support the main
   functionalities in our proposed architecture.

2.  Terminology

   We use the following definitions, as established in [ETSI-NFV-DEF]:

   Administrative Domain:  Collection of systems and networks operated
      by a single organization or administrative authority.

   Network Function (NF):  Functional block within a network
      infrastructure that has well-defined external interfaces and well-
      defined functional behaviour.

   Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV):  The principle of separating
      network functions from the hardware they run on by using virtual
      hardware abstraction.

   NF Forwarding Graph: (NFFG):  Graph of logical links connecting NF
      nodes for the purpose of describing traffic flow between these
      network functions.

   Network Service Orchestration (NSO):  Function responsible for
      network service lifecycle management.

   Resource Orchestration (RO):  Function responsible for global
      resource management governance.

   Our proof of concept implementation follows the architectural
   proposal of the 5GEx project [H2020.5GEX].  Some additional 5GEx
   terms commonly used in this document are defined below:

   Domain Orchestrator (DO):  Performs Resource Orchestration and/or
      Service Orchestration within the same administrative domain.

Internet-Draft    ALTO-based Multi-domain Orchestration       March 2018


   Multi-domain Orchestrator (MdO):  Coordinates resource and/or service
      orchestration at multi-domain level, where multi-domain may refer
      to multiple DOs or multiple administrative domains.

   Resource Topology (RT):  Functional module that is responsible for
      keeping an updated global view of the underlying infrastructure
      topology exposed by DOs.

   Service Graph (SG):  A high-level data model for defining flexible
      network services (including traffic steering primitives).

   Service Access Point (SAP):  A named/tagged port supporting stitching
      (service to service, domain to domain, etc.)

3.  Scope

   Existing proposals for the network service orchestration are
   intrinsically conceived for single administrative domain scenarios.
   For example, in the standard service orchestration model described in
   ETSI NFV MANO framework [ETSI-NFV-MANO], one orchestrator is supposed
   to work within one administrative domain.  The analysis of
   orchestration and management of network Services over multiple
   administrative domains have begun to be addressed by ETSI
   in [ETSI-NFV-MANO-MDO].

   Envisioned 5G scenarios are expected to work not only with
   heterogeneous technologies but also across different network
   operators.  Many ongoing initiatives and projects related are
   addressing the multi-provider multi-domain orchestration challenges
   under different approaches.  For example, [H2020.5GEX] seeks to
   integrate multiple administrations and technologies through the
   collaboration between operations.  Other studies are envisioned to
   use a centralized approach, where each domain advertises its
   capabilities to a federation layer which will act as a
   broker [VITAL][T-NOVA].  The proposed architecture in [ICAF] allows
   the creation of cloud services from different administrative domains,
   however, it is not related to the provisioning of NFV-based cross-
   domain network services.

   All such proposals described above envision the potential
   introduction of new business model approaches, including federation
   models [PPP-5:2013] among administrative domains.  In this context,
   this document considers each network operator involved in the
   community advertises its abstracted capabilities (e.g., software/
   hardware resources, physical/virtual network functions, etc.) to a
   broker (i.e., 3rd party).  This latter, in its turn, provides or
   assists coordinate E2E network services spanning multi-domain
   networks.

4.  Problem Statement and Challenges

   The provision of value-added services through a brokerage level of
   orchestration requires mechanisms through which single domains can
   describe their network capabilities in an interoperable manner.
   Different interfaces, subject to potential standardization
   opportunities, are necessary to advertise capabilities, resources,
   and VNFs to trusted entities.

   Network service orchestration in Multi-domain (Multi-operator/multi-
   technology) environments is not trivial due to series of challenges:

   Scalability:  Involves the distribution of topology and resource
        information in a peer-to-peer fashion (MdO-to-MdO).  Multi-
        operator multi-domain environments where the information
        distribution is advertised in a peer-to-peer model scales
        linearly.  It means more MdO interconnections one has, the more
        it "costs" to distribute.

   Flexibility:  Considers that a distributed approach does not allow
        domains without physical infrastructure (e.g., without BGP or
        BGP-LS) to advertise resource capabilities and networking
        resources.  Such procedures consist in deploying and configuring
        physical peering points for these domains.

   Complexity:  Refers to the discovery mechanism to pre-select
        candidate domains, accounting for resources and capabilities,
        necessary for an end-to-end network service deployment An
        intrinsic complexity exists in the process of assembling,
        logically organizing, and enabling abstraction views of
        different resources and capabilities in multi-domain scenarios.

5.  Proposed Approach

   The primary design goal for ALTO-based Broker-assisted Multi-domain
   Orchestration is to discover resource and topology information from
   different administrative domains involved in the federation, while
   also safeguarding the privacy and autonomy of every domain.

   In the architectural proposal shown in Figure 1, a broker component
   is conceived to be working as coordinator of a set of MdOs, whose key
   components are: the Inter-domain Resource (IdR), the Inter-domain
   Topology (IdT) and the ALTO Server.

5.1.  Inter-domain Resource (IdR) Component

   It creates a hierarchical database that contains inter-domain
   resource information such as resource availability (i.e., CPU,
   memory, and storage), Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and Physical
   Network Functions (PNFs) supported and Service Access Points (SAPs)
   to access those resources.  UNIFY [UNIFY.NFFG], TOSCA [TOSCA], ETSI-
   NFV [ETSI-NFV-MANO], among other data models can be used to create
   the interface between IdR and MdOs.

Internet-Draft    ALTO-based Multi-domain Orchestration       March 2018


5.2.  Inter-domain Topology (IdT) Component

   A hierarchical TED (Traffic Engineering Database) that contains
   inter-domain network topology information including additional key
   parameters (e.g., throughput and latency of links).  This information
   can be retrieved from each MdO through BGP-LS or REST interfaces.

5.3.  ALTO Server Functionalities

   The ALTO server component is the core of the broker layer.  Multiple
   logically centralized ALTO servers use the information collected from
   IdR and IdT modules to create and provide abstract maps with a
   simplified view, yet enough information about MdOs involved in the
   federation.  This information includes domain-level topology, storage
   resources, computation resources, networking resources and PNF/VNF
   capabilities.

   As an ALTO client, each MdO sends ALTO service queries to the ALTO
   server.  This server provides aggregated inter-domain information
   exposed as set ALTO base services defined in [RFC7285], e.g., Network
   Map, Cost Map and ALTO extension services, e.g., Property
   Map [DRAFT-PM], Multi-Cost Map [RFC8189], Path Vector [DRAFT-PV].

   For example, when a source MdO receives a customer service request,
   it checks whether or not it can deliver the full service.  If it is
   unable to do so, the MdO consumes from the ALTO Server the Property
   Map service to have a clear global view of the resource information
   offered by other MdOs.  This information allows discovering which
   candidate MdOs may be contacted to deliver the remaining requirements
   of a requested end-to-end service deployment.  The connectivity
   information among discovered MdOs can be retrieved by a Cost Map
   service, responding, for instance, a path vector with the AS-level
   topology distance between the source MdO and candidate MdOs.

5.4.  Required ALTO Extensions

   The Property Map and the Cost Map examples defined in the previous
   section can be supported with some proposed extensions to the ALTO
   base protocol.

   In this section, we introduce a non-normative overview of the
   Property Map and Filtered Cost Map extensions.

5.4.1.  Property Map Extensions

   The ALTO server MUST return multiple values for each property in the
   Property Map. For example, MdOs exchange (among others) a list NFs
   and SAPs which are supported by them.  So in this scenario, an array

Internet-Draft    ALTO-based Multi-domain Orchestration       March 2018


   of values can provide sufficient information that is not possible
   with single string values.

   The specifications for the "Media Types", "HTTP Method", "Accept
   Input Parameters", "Capabilities" and "Uses" (described in
   Section 4.1 [1], Section 4.2 [2], Section 4.3 [3], Section 4.4 [4],
   Section 4.5 [5] of [DRAFT-PM] [6], respectively) remain unchanged.

   The response is the same as Section 4.6 of [DRAFT-PM] [7], except
   that for each property name defined in the resource's "capabilities"
   list, the corresponding property value MUST be encoded as JSONArray
   instead of JSONString.

   Section 5.5.1 gives an example of a property map request and its
   response.

5.4.2.  Filtered Cost Map Extensions

   The ALTO server MUST provide connectivity information for every SG
   link in the SG path for an E2E requirement.  This information is the
   AS-level topology distance in the form of path vector, and it
   includes all possible ways for each (source node, destination node)
   pair in the SG link.

   In this section, we propose an extension of the Filtered Cost Map
   defined in Section 6.1 of [DRAFT-PV] [8].

   The specifications for the "Media Types", "HTTP method",
   "Capabilities" and "Uses" (described in Section 6.1 of [DRAFT-PV]
   [9]) are unchanged.

5.4.2.1.  Accept Input Parameters

   The ReqFilteredCostMap object in Section 6.1.2 of [DRAFT-PV] [10] is
   extended as follow:
















Lachos & Rothenberg     Expires September 6, 2018               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    ALTO-based Multi-domain Orchestration       March 2018


     object {
       [NFFG sg;]
     } ReqFilteredCostMap;

     object {
       JSONString nfs<1..*>;
       JSONString saps<1..*>;
       NextHops sg_links<1..*>;
       REQs reqs<1..*>;
     } NFFG;

     object {
       JSONNumber id;
       JSONString src-node;
       JSONString dst-node;
     } NextHops;

     object {
       JSONString id;
       JSONString src-node;
       JSONString dst-node;
       JSONNumber sg-path<1..*>;
     } REQs;



   sg:  If present, the ALTO Server MUST allow the request input to
      include an SG with a formatted body as an NFFG object.  An NFFG
      object contains NFs, SAPs, SG links representing logical
      connections between NFs, SAPs or both and E2E requirements as a
      list of ids of SG links.

   It is worth noting that further versions of this draft will define a
   more elaborated NFFG object to support extended parameters such as
   monitoring parameters, resource requirements, etc.

5.4.2.2.  Response

   If the ALTO client includes the path vector cost mode in the "cost-
   type" or "multi-cost-types" field of the input parameter, the
   response for each SG link in each E2E requirement MUST be encoded as
   a JSONArray of JSONArrays of JSONStrings.  Anyone of the sub-arrays
   indicates a potential candidate path calculated as the per-domain
   topological distance corresponding to the amount of traversing
   domains.

   Moreover, as defined in Section 6.3.6 of [DRAFT-PV] [11], If an ALTO
   client sends a request of the media type "application/alto-

   costmapfilter+json" and accepts "multipart/related", the ALTO server
   MUST provide path vector information along with the associated
   Property Map information (e.g., entry points of the corresponding
   foreign domains), in the same body of the response.

   Section 5.5.2 gives an example of the Filtered Cost Map query and the
   corresponding responses.

5.5.  Examples of Message Exchange

   This section list a couple of examples of the Property Map and
   Filtered Cost Map queries and the corresponding responses.  These
   responses are based on the information in Table 1 and Table 2 of a
   use case implementation described in Appendix A.

5.5.1.  Property Map Service

   In this example, the ALTO client wants to retrieve the entire
   Property Map for PID entities with the "entry-point", "cpu", "mem",
   "storage", "port" and "nf" properties.

5.5.2.  Filtered Cost Map Service

   The following example uses the Filtered Cost Map service to request
   the path vector for a given E2E requirement.  The SG request
   information in Table 2 is used to describe the service, and it is
   composed of three NFs (NF1, NF2, and NF3) and two SAPs (SAP1 and
   SAP2).  Links connecting the NFs and SAPs ("sg_links" tag) are also
   included, followed by an E2E requirement ("reqs" tag) with
   information about the order in which NFs are traversed from SAP1 to
   SAP2.

   The ALTO server returns connectivity information for the E2E
   requirement provided by the ALTO Client request of the above example.
   Also, the response includes Property Map information for each element
   in the path vector.  In this case, it is retrieved a Property Map
   with the "entry-point" property, i.e., the URL of the MdO entry point
   for the corresponding network.

Appendix A.  Proof of Concept Use Case Implementation

   A strawman use case scenario has been implemented following the
   architectural proposal of the 5GEx project [H2020.5GEX].  It refers
   to an E2ENS orchestration involving three administrative domains.

   As shown in Figure 2, each administrative domain has an MdO (MdO-AS1,
   MdO-AS2, and MdO-AS3) to coordinate resource and/or service
   orchestration at multi-operator level via interface I2 APIs.  For the
   orchestration within the same administrative domain, each MdO uses

Internet-Draft    ALTO-based Multi-domain Orchestration       March 2018


   emulated DOs with emulated I3 interfaces, since no data-plane is
   present.  DOs use static configuration files to load local
   information about resources (I3-RC) and topology (I3-RT).  The
   different MdO components are based on existing open source tools such
   as ESCAPE [H2020.5GEX.ESCAPE] (Service/Resource Orchestrator) and
   Netphony-topology [TELEFONICA.NET.TOPO] (Resource Topology) and run
   in Docker containers on a single computer.  Besides, MdOs expose I1
   interfaces to the tenants who request services and/or slices which
   should follow a Network Function Forwarding Graph (NFFG) [UNIFY.NFFG]
   format.

   In case of the broker layer, the IdR and IdT components use a UNIFY
   Virtualizer API [UNIFY.NFFG] (broker-based I2-RC API) and a REST API
   (broker-based I2-RT API) respectively, in order to create the
   hierarchical databases.  Regarding the IdT, the administrative domain
   2 is a transit provider so that the domain-level topology computed
   is: AS1-AS2-AS3.  From the inter-domain information are created the
   two different ALTO Map Services: (i) Property Map and (ii) Cost Map.

   The Property Map includes property values grouped by Autonomous
   System (AS).  Such values are SAPs, NFs and the 5GEx Entry Point
   (e.g., the URL of the ESCAPE orchestrator).  An example of the
   Property Map in our prototype is:

   +-----+------------+-------+--------------+-----+-----+-------+-----+
   |     |   Entry    |  Port | Capabilities | CPU | MEM |  Stor | ... |
   |     |   Point    |  SAP  |              |     |     |  age  |     |
   +-----+------------+-------+--------------+-----+-----+-------+-----+
   | AS1 | http://... |  SAP1 |  {NF1, NF3}  |  50 |  60 |   70  | ... |
   | AS2 | http://... |   -   |    {NF2}     |  10 |  20 |   30  | ... |
   | AS3 | http://... |  SAP2 |  {NF1, NF3}  |  80 |  90 |  100  | ... |
   +-----+------------+-------+--------------+-----+-----+-------+-----+

   The Cost Map defines a path vector as an array of ASes, representing
   the AS-level topological distance for a given E2ENS request.  Path
   vector constraints (as described in the Multi-Cost Map [RFC8189]) can
   be applied to restricts the response to costs that satisfy a list of
   simple predicates.

   Table 2 below shows a brief example of an SG request and its path
   vector response containing a list of potential providers to be
   traversed to deliver such service.  Every AS path is computed from
   the inter-domain topology information in the IdT module.  In our
   scenario, MdO-AS2 is a transit provider, so that the domain-level
   topology map is AS1<->AS2<->AS3.
