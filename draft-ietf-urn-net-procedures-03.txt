Abstract

   RFCXXXX defines a how DNS is used as a Resolver Discovery System
   database that contains URI delegation rules (sometimes called
   resolution hints). That document specifies that the first step in
   that algorithm is to append 'URI.NET' to the URI scheme and retrieve
   the NAPTR record for that domain-name.  I.e., the first step in
   resolving "http://foo.com/" would be to look up a NAPTR record for
   the domain "http.URI.NET". URN resolution also follows a similar
   procedure but uses the 'URN.NET' zone as its root. This document
   describes the procedures for inserting a new rule into the 'URI.NET'
   and 'URN.NET' zones.

Internet-Draft      URI.NET Registration Procedures        February 2000


1. Introduction

   This document defines the policies and procedures for inserting
   NAPTR records into the 'URI.NET' and 'URN.NET' zones for the purpose
   of resolving URIs according to "Resolution of Uniform Resource
   Identifiers using the Domain Name System", RFCXXXX[1], which is an
   application of the NAPTR DNS Resource Record defined in RFCXXXX[2]. 

2. URI Resolution vs URN Resolution

   RFCXXXX[1] defines how both URI resolution and URN[3] resolution
   work when DNS is used as the delegation rule (or hint) database.
   Specifically it says that the initial instructions ('hints') for
   DNS-based resolution of URIs are stored as resource records in the
   'URI.NET' DNS zone. 

   Since a URN is a kind of URI, a hint for resolution of the URI
   prefix 'urn:' will also be stored in the 'URI.NET' zone. This rule
   states that the namespace id[3] is extracted, 'URN.NET' is appended
   to the end of the namespace id, and the result is used as the key
   for retrieval of a subsequent NAPTR record[2]. 

3. Registration Policies

   The creation of a given URI scheme or URN namespace id (NID) follows
   the appropriate registration documents for those spaces. URI schemes
   follow "Registration Procedures for URL Scheme Names"  (RFC
   2717)[7]. URN namespace ids follow "URN Namespace Definition
   Mechanisms" (RFC 2611)[6]. 

3.1 URI.NET Registration

3.1.1 Only Schemes in the IETF Tree Allowed

   In order to be inserted into the URI.NET zone, the subsequent URI
   scheme MUST be registered under the IETF URI tree. The requirements
   for this tree are specified in [7]. 

3.1.2 Scheme Registration Takes Precedence

   The registration of a NAPTR record for a URI scheme MUST NOT precede
   proper registration of that scheme and publication of a stable
   specification in accordance with [7]. The IESG or its designated
   expert will review the request for 
   1.  correctness and technical soundness
   2.  consistency with the published URI specification, and
   3.  to ensure that the NAPTR record for a DNS-based URI does not
       delegate resolution of the URI to a party other than the holder
       of the DNS name.  This last rule is to insure that a given URI's

       resolution hint doesn't hijack (inadvertently or otherwise)
       network traffic for a given domain.

3.1.3 NAPTR Registration May Accompany Scheme Registration

   A request for a URI.NET registration MAY accompany a request for a
   URI scheme (in accordance with [7]), in which case both requests
   will be reviewed simultaneously by IESG or its designated experts. 

3.1.4 Registration or Changes after Scheme Registration

   A request for a NAPTR record (or an request to change an existing
   NAPTR record) MAY be submitted after the URI prefix has been
   registered.   If the specification for the URI prefix is controlled
   by some other party than IETF, IESG will require approval from the
   owner/maintainer of that specification before the registration will
   be accepted. This is in addition to any technical review of the
   NAPTR registration done by IESG or its designated experts. 

3.2 URN.NET Registration

3.2.1 NID Registration Takes Precedence

   The registration of a NAPTR record for a URN NID MUST NOT precede
   proper registration of that NID and publication of a stable
   specification in accordance with [6]. This is to prevent the
   registration of a NAPTR record in URN.NET from circumventing the NID
   registration process. 

3.2.2 NAPTR Registration May Accompany NID Registration

   A request for a URN.NET registration MAY accompany a request for a
   NID (in accordance with [6]), in which case both requests will be
   reviewed at the same time. 

3.2.3 Registration or Changes after Scheme Registration

   A request for a NAPTR record (or an request to change an existing
   NAPTR record) MAY be submitted after the NID has been registered.  
   If the specification for the NID is controlled by some other party
   than IETF, IESG will require approval from the owner/maintainer of
   that specification before the registration will be accepted. This is
   in addition to any technical review of the NAPTR registration done
   by IESG or its designated experts. 

   Note that this applies to all NAPTR records for a particular NID,
   even though a NAPTR record might affect only part of the URN space
   assigned to an NID

4. Requirements on hints

   Delegation of a namespace can happen in two ways. In the case of
   most URIs, the key being delegated to is hard-coded into the
   identifier itself (i.e. a hostname in an HTTP URL). The syntax of
   where this new key is located is predetermined by the syntax of the
   scheme. In other cases, the new key can be part of the hint itself.
   This is the functional equivalent of saying, "if this rule matches
   then this is always the key." 

   In order to minimize the query load on the URI.NET and URN.NET
   zones, it is anticipated that the resource records in those zones
   will have extremely long "times to live" (TTLs), perhaps measured in
   years. 

   Thus, for any URI prefix or URN namespace for which the resolution
   hints are likely to change, the actual rule should be stored in some
   other (less stable) DNS zone, and within URI.NET or URN.NET a stable
   NAPTR record should be used to delegate queries to that less stable
   zone. 

   For example, the 'foo' URN namespace has flexible rules for how
   delegation takes place. Instead of putting those rules in the
   URN.NET zone, the entry instead punts those rules off to a
   nameserver that has a shorter time to live. The record in URN.NET
   would look like this: 

          foo     IN NAPTR 100 10  ""  "" "" urn-resolver.foo.com.

   Thus, when the client starts out in the resolution process, the
   first step will be to query foo.URN.NET to find the above record,
   the second step is to begin asking 'urn-resolver.foo.com' for the
   NAPTR records that contain the resolution rules. The TTL at the root
   is very long. The TTL at the 'urn-resolver.foo.com' is much shorter. 

   Conversely, the 'http' URL scheme adheres to a particular syntax
   that specifies that the host to ask is specified in the URL in
   question. Since this syntax does not change, that rule can be
   specified in the URI.NET zone. The record would look like this: 

          http    IN NAPTR 100 100 "" ""  "/http:\\/\\/([^\\/:]+)/\\2/i" .

   Thus, the second step of resolution is to use the domain-name found
   in the URL as the next key in the cycle. If, for example, that NAPTR
   was terminal and contains some hostname in the replacement field,
   then the client could contact that host in order to ask questions
   about this particular URI.

5. Submission Procedure

   Using the MIME Content-Type registration mechanism[5]as a model for
   a successful registration mechanism, the 'URI.NET' and 'URN.NET'
   procedures consist of a request template submitted to an open
   mailing list made up of interested parties. If no objections are
   made within a two week period, a representative of the registration
   authority considers the submission to be accepted and enters that
   submission into the nameserver. 

   o  Registrations for the 'URI.NET' zone are sent to
      'register@URI.NET'.
   o  Registrations for the 'URN.NET' zone are sent to
      'register@URN.NET'.

   At this time the registration authority is expected to be the IANA. 

   Objections are restricted to those that point out impacts on the
   zone itself or to DNS in general. Objections to the URL scheme or to
   the URN namespace-id are not allowed, as these should be raised in
   their respective forums. The logical conclusion of this is that ANY
   sanctioned URL scheme or URN namespace MUST be allowed to be
   registered if it meets the requirements specified in this document
   as regards times to live and general impact to the DNS. 

6. Registration Template

   The template to be sent to the appropriate list MUST contain the
   following values: 

6.1 Key

   This is the URN NID or URL scheme, which is used as the domain
   portion of the DNS entry. It must be valid according to the
   procedures specified in the URN namespace-id assignment document and
   any future standards for registering new URL schemes. 

6.2 Authority

   This is the authority doing the registration of the record. It must
   be an authority recognized as either the IESG or any authority
   defined in the URN NID[6] or URL scheme registration[7] documents. 

6.3 Records

   The actual DNS records representing the rule set for the key. The
   required values are Preference, Order, Flags, Services, Regex, and
   Replacement as defined by RFCXXXX[2].

7. Example Template


      To: register@URN.NET
      From: joe@foo.com

      Key: foo
      Authority: Foo Technology, Inc as specified in RFCFOO
      Record: foo	IN NAPTR 100 100 "" "" "" urn.foo.com.

8. The URN Registration in the URI.NET zone

   Since this document discusses the URI.NET and URN.NET zones and the
   URN rule that exists in the URI.NET zone, it makes sense for the
   registration template for the URN URI rule to be specified here: 


      To: register@URI.NET
      From: The IETF URN Working Group

      Key: urn
      Authority: RFC2141
      Record: urn	IN NAPTR 0 0 "" "" "/urn:([^:]+)/\\2/i" .

9. IANA Considerations

   This document describes a mechanism for registering representations
   of protocol items that have already been registered with some IETF
   sanctioned agency (probably the IANA as well). This means that the
   IANA need not determine appropriateness of the underlying
   namespaces, since that is determined by another process. 

   The only real impact on the IANA will be 
   o  to create and maintain (or designate some other entity to
      maintain) a primary nameserver for the URI.NET and URN.NET zones; 
   o  to maintain the mailing lists "register@URI.NET" and
      "register@URN.NET" as the forum for discussions of submissions;
      and 
   o  to act as the party that determines if all objections have been
      noted and accommodated.
