             ICN Adaptation to LoWPAN Networks (ICN LoWPAN)

Abstract

   This document defines a convergence layer for CCNx and NDN over IEEE
   802.15.4 LoWPAN networks.  A new frame format is specified to adapt
   CCNx and NDN packets to the small MTU size of IEEE 802.15.4.  For
   that, syntactic and semantic changes to the TLV-based header formats
   are described.  To support compatibility with other LoWPAN
   technologies that may coexist on a wireless medium, the dispatching
   scheme provided by 6LoWPAN is extended to include new dispatch types
   for CCNx and NDN.  Additionally, the link fragmentation component of
   the 6LoWPAN dispatching framework is applied to ICN chunks.  In its
   second part, the document defines stateless and stateful compression
   schemes to improve efficiency on constrained links.  Stateless
   compression reduces TLV expressions to static header fields for
   common use cases.  Stateful compression schemes elide state local to
   the LoWPAN and replace names in data packets by short local
   identifiers.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet of Things (IoT) has been identified as a promising
   deployment area for Information Centric Networks (ICN), as
   infrastructureless access to content, resilient forwarding, and in-
   network data replication demonstrated notable advantages over the
   traditional host-to-host approach on the Internet [NDN-EXP1],
   [NDN-EXP2].  Recent studies [NDN-MAC] have shown that an appropriate
   mapping to link layer technologies has a large impact on the
   practical performance of an ICN.  This will be even more relevant in
   the context of IoT communication where nodes often exchange messages
   via low-power wireless links under lossy conditions.  In this memo,
   we address the base adaptation of data chunks to such link layers for
   the ICN flavors NDN [NDN] and CCNx [RFC8569], [RFC8609].

   The IEEE 802.15.4 [ieee802.15.4] link layer is used in low-power and
   lossy networks (see "LLN" in [RFC7228]), in which devices are
   typically battery-operated and constrained in resources.
   Characteristics of LLNs include an unreliable environment, low

   bandwidth transmissions, and increased latencies.  IEEE 802.15.4
   admits a maximum physical layer packet size of 127 octets.  The
   maximum frame header size is 25 octets, which leaves 102 octets for
   the payload.  IEEE 802.15.4 security features further reduce this
   payload length by up to 21 octets, yielding a net of 81 octets for
   CCNx or NDN packet headers, signatures and content.

   6LoWPAN [RFC4944], [RFC6282] is a convergence layer that provides
   frame formats, header compression and link fragmentation for IPv6
   packets in IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  The 6LoWPAN adaptation introduces
   a dispatching framework that prepends further information to 6LoWPAN
   packets, including a protocol identifier for IEEE 802.15.4 payload
   and meta information about link fragmentation.

   Prevalent Type-Length-Value (TLV) based packet formats such as in
   CCNx and NDN are designed to be generic and extensible.  This leads
   to header verbosity which is inappropriate in constrained
   environments of IEEE 802.15.4 links.  This document presents ICN
   LoWPAN, a convergence layer for IEEE 802.15.4 motivated by 6LoWPAN.
   ICN LoWPAN compresses packet headers of CCNx as well as NDN and
   allows for an increased effective payload size per packet.
   Additionally, reusing the dispatching framework defined by 6LoWPAN
   enables compatibility between coexisting wireless networks of
   competing technologies.  This also allows to reuse the link
   fragmentation scheme specified by 6LoWPAN for ICN LoWPAN.

   ICN LoWPAN defines a more space efficient representation of CCNx and
   NDN packet formats.  This syntactic change is described for CCNx and
   NDN separately, as the header formats and TLV encodings differ
   notably.  For further reductions, default header values suitable for
   constrained IoT networks are selected in order to elide corresponding
   TLVs.  Experimental evaluations of the ICN LoWPAN header compression
   schemes in [ICNLOWPAN] illustrate a reduced message overhead, a
   shortened message airtime, and an overall decline in power
   consumption for typical Class 2 devices compared to uncompressed ICN
   messages.

   In a typical IoT scenario (see (Figure 1)), embedded devices are
   interconnected via a quasi-stationary infrastructure using a border
   router (BR) that uplinks the constrained LoWPAN network by some
   Gateway with the public Internet.  In ICN based IoT networks, non-
   local Interest and Data messages transparently travel through the BR
   up and down between a Gateway and the embedded devices situated in
   the constrained LoWPAN.

3.  Overview of ICN LoWPAN

3.1.  Link-Layer Convergence

   ICN LoWPAN provides a convergence layer that maps ICN packets onto
   constrained link-layer technologies.  This includes features such as
   link-layer fragmentation, protocol separation on the link-layer
   level, and link-layer address mappings.  The stack traversal is
   visualized in Figure 2.

   Section 4 of this document defines the convergence layer for IEEE
   802.15.4.

3.2.  Stateless Header Compression

   ICN LoWPAN also defines a stateless header compression scheme with
   the main purpose of reducing header overhead of ICN packets.  This is
   of particular importance for link-layers with small MTUs.  The
   stateless compression does not require pre-configuration of global
   state.

   The CCNx and NDN header formats are composed of Type-Length-Value
   (TLV) fields to encode header data.  The advantage of TLVs is its
   native support of variably structured data.  The main disadvantage of
   TLVs is the verbosity that results from storing the type and length
   of the encoded data.

   The stateless header compression scheme makes use of compact bit
   fields to indicate the presence of optional TLVs in the uncompressed
   packet.  The order of set bits in the bit fields corresponds to the
   order of each TLV in the packet.  Further compression is achieved by

   specifying default values and reducing the codomain of certain header
   fields.

   Figure 3 demonstrates the stateless header compression idea.  In this
   example, the first type of the first TLV is removed and the
   corresponding bit in the bit field is set.  The second TLV represents
   a fixed-length TLV (e.g., the Nonce TLV in NDN), so that the type and
   the length fields are removed.  The third TLV represents a boolean
   TLV (e.g., the MustBeFresh selector in NDN) for which the type,
   length and the value fields are elided.

                            inclusion of TLVs.

   Stateless TLV compression for NDN is defined in Section 5.  Section 6
   defines the stateless TLV compression for CCNx.

   The extensibility of this compression is described in Section 4.1.1
   and allows future documents to update the compression rules outlined
   in this manuscript.

3.3.  Stateful Header Compression

   ICN LoWPAN further employs two orthogonal stateful compression
   schemes for packet size reductions which are defined in Section 8.
   These mechanisms rely on shared contexts that are either distributed



Gundogan, et al.       Expires September 10, 2020               [Page 7]

   and maintained in the entire LoWPAN, or are generated on-demand hop-
   wise on a particular Interest-data path.

   The shared context identification is defined in Section 8.1.  The
   hop-wise name compression "en-route" is specified in Section 8.2.

4.  IEEE 802.15.4 Adaptation

4.1.  LoWPAN Encapsulation

   The IEEE 802.15.4 frame header does not provide a protocol identifier
   for its payload.  This causes problems of misinterpreting frames when
   several network layers coexist on the same link.  To mitigate errors,
   6LoWPAN defines dispatches as encapsulation headers for IEEE 802.15.4
   frames (see Section 5 of [RFC4944]).  Multiple LoWPAN encapsulation
   headers can prepend the actual payload and each encapsulation header
   is identified by a dispatch type.

   [RFC8025] further specifies dispatch pages to switch between
   different contexts.  When a LoWPAN parser encounters a "Page switch"
   LoWPAN encapsulation header, then all following encapsulation headers
   are interpreted by using a dispatch table as specified by the "Page
   switch" header.  Page 0 and page 1 are reserved for 6LoWPAN.  This
   document uses page TBD1 ("1111 TBD1 (0xFTBD1)") for NDN and page TBD2
   ("1111 TBD2 (0xFTBD2)") for CCNx.

   The base dispatch format (Figure 4) is used and extended by CCNx and
   NDN in Section 5 and Section 6.

   Extension octets are numbered according to their order.  Future
   documents MUST follow the naming scheme "EXT_0, EXT_1, ...", when
   updating or referring to a specific dispatch extension octet.
   Amendments that require an exchange of configurational parameters
   between devices SHOULD use manifests to encode structured data in a
   well-defined format, as, e.g., outlined in [I-D.irtf-icnrg-flic].

4.2.  Link Fragmentation

   Small payload sizes in the LoWPAN require fragmentation for various
   network layers.  Therefore, Section 5.3 of [RFC4944] defines a
   protocol-independent fragmentation dispatch type, a fragmentation
   header for the first fragment, and a separate fragmentation header
   for subsequent fragments.  ICN LoWPAN adopts this fragmentation
   handling of [RFC4944].

   The Fragmentation LoWPAN header can encapsulate other dispatch
   headers.  The order of dispatch types is defined in Section 5 of
   [RFC4944].  Figure 8 shows the fragmentation scheme.  The reassembled
   ICN LoWPAN frame does not contain any fragmentation headers and is
   depicted in Figure 9.

5.  Space-efficient Message Encoding for NDN

5.1.  TLV Encoding

   The NDN packet format consists of TLV fields using the TLV encoding
   that is described in [NDN-PACKET-SPEC].  Type and length fields are
   of variable size, where numbers greater than 252 are encoded using
   multiple octets.

   If the type or length number is less than "253", then that number is
   encoded into the actual type or length field.  If the number is
   greater or equals "253" and fits into 2 octets, then the type or
   length field is set to "253" and the number is encoded in the next
   following 2 octets in network byte order, i.e., from the most
   significant byte (MSB) to the least significant byte (LSB).  If the
   number is greater than 2 octets and fits into 4 octets, then the type
   or length field is set to "254" and the number is encoded in the
   subsequent 4 octets in network byte order.  For larger numbers, the
   type or length field is set to "255" and the number is encoded in the
   subsequent 8 octets in network byte order.

   In this specification, compressed NDN TLVs make use of a different
   TLV encoding scheme that reduces size.  Instead of using the first
   octet as a marker for the number of following octets, the compressed

Internet-Draft          ICN Adaptation to LoWPANs             March 2020


   NDN TLV scheme uses a method to chain a variable number of octets
   together.  If an octet equals "255 (0xFF)", then the following octet
   will also be interpreted.  The actual value of a chain equals the sum
   of all constituents.

   If the type or length number is less than "255", then that number is
   encoded into the actual type or length field (Figure 10 a).  If the
   type or length number (X) fits into 2 octets, then the first octet is
   set to "255" and the subsequent octet equals "X mod 255" (Figure 10
   b).  Following this scheme, a variable-sized number (X) is encoded
   using multiple octets of "255" with a trailing octet containing "X
   mod 255" (Figure 10 c).

5.2.  Name TLV Compression

   This Name TLV compression encodes length fields of two consecutive
   NameComponent TLVs into one octet, using 4 bits each.  This process
   limits the length of a NameComponent TLV to 15 octets.  A length of 0
   marks the end of the compressed Name TLV.  An example for this
   encoding is presented in Figure 11.

5.3.  Interest Messages

5.3.1.  Uncompressed Interest Messages

   An uncompressed Interest message uses the base dispatch format (see
   Figure 4) and sets the C as well as the M flag to "0" (Figure 12).
   "resv" MUST be set to 0.  The Interest message is handed to the NDN
   network stack without modifications.

                       0   1            ...        7

     Figure 12: Dispatch format for uncompressed NDN Interest messages

5.3.2.  Compressed Interest Messages

   The compressed Interest message uses the extended dispatch format
   (Figure 5) and sets the C flag to "1" and the M flag to "0".  If an
   Interest message contains TLVs that are not mentioned in the
   following compression rules, then this message MUST be sent
   uncompressed.

   This specification assumes that a HopLimit TLV is part of the
   original Interest message.  If such HopLimit TLV is not present, it
   will be set with a default value of DEFAULT_NDN_HOPLIMIT prior to the
   compression.

Internet-Draft          ICN Adaptation to LoWPANs             March 2020


   In the default use case, the Interest message is compressed with the
   following minimal rule set:

   1.  The "Type" field of the outermost MessageType TLV is removed.

   2.  The Name TLV is compressed according to Section 5.2.  For this,
       all NameComponents are expected to be of type
       GenericNameComponent with a length greater than 0.  An
       ImplicitSha256DigestComponent or ParametersSha256DigestComponent
       MAY appear at the end of the name.  In any other case, the
       message MUST be sent uncompressed.

   3.  InterestLifetime TLV is moved to the end of the compressed
       Interest and is encoded as described in Section 7.  If a lifetime
       is not a valid time-value, then the lifetime is rounded up to the
       nearest valid time-value as specified in Section 7.

   4.  The Type and Length fields of Nonce TLV, HopLimit TLV and
       InterestLifetime TLV are elided.  The Nonce value has a length of
       4 octets and the HopLimit value has a length of 1 octet.  The
       compressed InterestLifetime (Section 7) has a length of 1 octet.
       The presence of an InterestLifetime TLV is deduced from the
       remaining length to parse.

   The compressed NDN LoWPAN Interest message is visualized in
   Figure 13.

       GenericNameComponent and to have a length greater than 0.  In any
       other case, the message MUST be sent uncompressed.

   3.  The MetaInfo TLV Type and Length fields are elided from the
       compressed Data message.

   4.  The FreshnessPeriod TLV MUST be moved to the end of the
       compressed Data message and the length is set to 1.  Type and
       Length fields are elided and the value is encoded as described in
       Section 7.  If the freshness period is not a valid time-value,
       then the message MUST be sent uncompressed in order to preserve
       the security envelope of the Data message.  The presence of a
       FreshnessPeriod TLV is deduced from the remaining length to
       parse.

   5.  The Type fields of the SignatureInfo TLV, SignatureType TLV and
       SignatureValue TLV are removed.

   The compressed NDN LoWPAN Data message is visualized in Figure 17.

6.  Space-efficient Message Encoding for CCNx

6.1.  TLV Encoding

   The generic CCNx TLV encoding is described in [RFC8609].  Type and
   Length fields attain the common fixed length of 2 octets.

   The TLV encoding for CCNx LoWPAN is changed to the more space
   efficient encoding described in Section 5.1.  Hence NDN and CCNx use
   the same compressed format for writing TLVs.

6.2.  Name TLV Compression

   Name TLVs are compressed using the scheme already defined in
   Section 5.2 for NDN.  If a Name TLV contains T_IPID, T_APP, or
   organizational TLVs, then the name remains uncompressed.

6.3.  Interest Messages

6.3.1.  Uncompressed Interest Messages

   An uncompressed Interest message uses the base dispatch format (see
   Figure 4) and sets the C as well as the M flag to "0" (Figure 20).
   "resv" MUST be set to 0.  The Interest message is handed to the CCNx
   network stack without modifications.

6.3.2.  Compressed Interest Messages

   The compressed Interest message uses the extended dispatch format
   (Figure 5) and sets the C flag to "1" and the M flag to "0".  If an
   Interest message contains TLVs that are not mentioned in the
   following compression rules, then this message MUST be sent
   uncompressed.

   In the default use case, the Interest message is compressed with the
   following minimal rule set:

   1.  The Type and Length fields of the CCNx Message TLV are elided and
       are obtained from the Fixed Header on decompression.

   The compressed CCNx LoWPAN Interest message is visualized in
   Figure 21.

6.3.2.1.  Hop-By-Hop Header TLVs Compression

   Hop-By-Hop Header TLVs are unordered.  For an Interest message, two
   optional Hop-By-Hop Header TLVs are defined in [RFC8609], but several
   more can be defined in higher level specifications.  For the
   compression specified in the previous section, the Hop-By-Hop TLVs
   are ordered as follows:

   1.  Interest Lifetime TLV

   2.  Message Hash TLV

   Note: Other Hop-By-Hop Header TLVs than those two remain
   uncompressed.

6.4.  Content Objects

6.4.1.  Uncompressed Content Objects

   An uncompressed Content object uses the base dispatch format (see
   Figure 4) and sets the C flag to "0" and the M flag to "1"
   (Figure 25). "resv" MUST be set to 0.  The Content object is handed
   to the CCNx network stack without modifications.

6.4.2.  Compressed Content Objects

   The compressed Content object uses the extended dispatch format
   (Figure 5) and sets the C flag as well as the M flag to "1".  If a
   Content object contains TLVs that are not mentioned in the following
   compression rules, then this message MUST be sent uncompressed.

   By default, the Content object is compressed with the following base
   rule set:

   1.  The PacketType field is elided from the Fixed Header.

   2.  The Type and Length fields of the CCNx Message TLV are elided and
       are obtained from the Fixed Header on decompression.

   The compressed CCNx LoWPAN Data message is visualized in Figure 26.

7.  Compressed Time Encoding

   This document adopts the compact time representation
   [I-D.gundogan-icnrg-ccnx-timetlv] for relative time values.  Exponent
   (e) and mantissa (m) values are encoded in a 1-octet wide
   representation as depicted in Figure 29.

                         <--         one octet         -->
                         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                         |  exponent (e) |  mantissa (m) |
                         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

       Figure 29: A time-code with exponent and mantissa to encode a
                  logarithmic range time representation.

   The mantissa size is set to 3 bits, the exponent size to 5 bits, and
   a bias of -5 is applied.  This allows for a time representation that
   ranges from milliseconds with high precision to days with low
   precision.  The base unit for time values are seconds.  A time-value
   is calculated using the following formula, where (e) represents the
   exponent, (m) the mantissa, (m_max = 8) the maximum mantissa value,
   and (b) the bias.

   Subnormal (e == 0):  (0 + m/m_max) * 2^(1+b)

   Normalized (e > 0):  (1 + m/m_max) * 2^(e+b)

   The subnormal form provides a gradual underflow from the smallest
   normalized number towards zero.

   This configuration allows for the following ranges:

   o  Minimum subnormal number: 0 seconds

   o  Maximum subnormal number: ~0.054688 seconds

Internet-Draft          ICN Adaptation to LoWPANs             March 2020


   o  Minimum normalized number: ~0.062500 seconds

   o  Maximum normalized number: ~3.987284 years

   Valid time-values are always positive numbers.  An invalid time-value
   (t, in seconds) MUST be rounded down to the nearest valid time-value
   using this algorithm, where (e) represents the number of bits for the
   exponent, (m) the number of bits for the mantissa, and (m_max = 8)
   the maximum mantissa value.  The bias (b) is set to -5 as before.

   o  e := floor( log2( t/(2^-b) ))

   o  m := floor( 8 * (t / 2^(e+b) - 1 ))

8.  Stateful Header Compression

   Stateful header compression in ICN LoWPAN enables packet size
   reductions in two ways.  First, common information that is shared
   throughout the local LoWPAN may be memorized in context state at all
   nodes and omitted from communication.  Second, redundancy in a single
   Interest-data exchange may be removed from ICN stateful forwarding on
   a hop-by-hop bases and memorized in en-route state tables.

8.1.  LoWPAN-local State

   A context identifier (CID) is an octet that refers to a particular
   conceptual context between network devices and MAY be used to replace
   frequently appearing information, such as name prefixes, suffixes, or
   meta information, such as Interest lifetime.

                       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7

                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

                      Figure 30: Context Identifier.

   The ContextID refers to a locally-scoped unique identifier that
   represents contextual state shared between sender and receiver of the
   corresponding frame (see Figure 30).

   Such state shared between senders and receivers is removed from the
   compressed packet prior to sending, and reinserted after reception
   prior to passing to the upper stack.

   The initial distribution and maintenance of shared context is out of
   scope of this document.  Frames containing unknown or invalid CIDs
   MUST be silently discarded.

8.2.  En-route State

   In CCNx and NDN, Name TLVs are included in Interest messages, and
   they return in data messages.  Returning Name TLVs either equal the
   original Name TLV, or they contain the original Name TLV as a prefix.
   ICN LoWPAN reduces this redundancy in responses by replacing Name
   TLVs with single octets that represent link-local HopIDs.  HopIDs are
   carried as Context Identifiers of link-local scope as shown in
   Figure 31.

                       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                     | X |          HopID            |
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

                  Figure 31: Context Identifier as HopID.

   A HopID is valid, if not all ID bits are set to zero and invalid
   otherwise.  This yields 127 distinct HopIDs.  If this range (1...127)
   is exhausted, the messages MUST be sent without en-route state
   compression until new HopIDs are available.  An ICN LoWPAN node that
   forwards without replacing the name by a HopID (without en-route
   compression) MUST invalidate the HopID by setting all ID-bits to
   zero.

   While an Interest is traversing, a forwarder generates an ephemeral
   HopID that is tied to a PIT entry.  Each HopID MUST be unique within
   the local PIT and only exists during the lifetime of a PIT entry.  To
   maintain HopIDs, the local PIT is extended by two new columns: HIDi
   (inbound HopIDs) and HIDo (outbound HopIDs).

   HopIDs are included in Interests and stored on the next hop with the
   resulting PIT entry in the HIDi column.  The HopID is replaced with a
   newly generated local HopID before the Interest is forwarded.  This
   new HopID is stored in the HIDo column of the local PIT (see
   Figure 32).

         Figure 32: Setting compression state en-route (Interest).

   Responses include HopIDs that were obtained from Interests.  If the
   returning Name TLV equals the original Name TLV, then the name is
   entirely elided.  Otherwise, the distinct suffix is included along
   with the HopID.  When a response is forwarded, the contained HopID is
   extracted and used to match against the correct PIT entry by
   performing a lookup on the HIDo column.  The HopID is then replaced
   with the corresponding HopID from the HIDi column prior to forwarding
   the response (Figure 33).

         Figure 33: Eliding Name TLVs using en-route state (data).

   It should be noted that each forwarder of an Interest in an ICN
   LoWPAN network can individually decide whether to participate in en-
   route compression or not.  However, an ICN LoWPAN node SHOULD use en-
   route compression whenever the stateful compression mechanism is
   activated.

   Note also that the extensions of the PIT data structure are required
   only at ICN LoWPAN nodes, while regular NDN/CCNx forwarders outside
   of an ICN LoWPAN domain do not need to implement these extensions.

   A CID appears whenever the CID flag is set (see Figure 5).  The CID
   is appended to the last ICN LoWPAN dispatch octet as shown in

10.  Implementation Report and Guidance

   The ICN LoWPAN scheme defined in this document has been implemented
   as an extension of the NDN/CCNx software stack [CCN-LITE] in its IoT
   version on RIOT [RIOT].  An experimental evaluation for NDN over ICN
   LOWPAN with varying configurations has been performed in [ICNLOWPAN].
   Energy profilings and processing time measurements indicate
   significant energy savings, while amortized costs for processing show
   no penalties.

10.1.  Preferred Configuration

   The header compression performance depends on certain aspects and
   configurations.  It works best for the following cases:

   o  Each name component is of GenericNameComponent type and is limited
      to a length of 15 bytes.

   o  Relative time values use a compressed encoding as per Section 7.

Internet-Draft          ICN Adaptation to LoWPANs             March 2020


   o  Contextual state (e.g., prefixes) is distributed, such that long
      names can be elided from Interest and data messages.

10.2.  Further Experimental Deployments

   An investigation of ICN LoWPAN in large-scale deployments with
   varying traffic patterns using larger samples of the different board
   types available remains as future work.  Especially for the stateful
   en-route compression and link fragmentation, complex deployment
   scenarios may provide a better insight regarding compression
   parameters.  Multiple implementations that generate and deploy the
   compression options of this memo in different ways will also add to
   the experience and understanding of the benefits and limitations of
   the proposed schemes.

11.  Security Considerations

   Main memory is typically a scarce resource of constrained networked
   devices.  Fragmentation as described in this memo preserves fragments
   and purges them only after a packet is reassembled, which requires a
   buffering of all fragments.  This scheme is able to handle fragments
   for distinctive packets simultaneously, which can lead to overflowing
   packet buffers that cannot hold all necessary fragments for packet
   reassembly.  Implementers are thus urged to make use of appropriate
   buffer replacement strategies for fragments.

   The stateful header compression generates ephemeral HopIDs for
   incoming and outgoing Interests and consumes them on returning Data
   packets.  Forged Interests can deplete the number of available
   HopIDs, thus leading to a denial of compression service for
   subsequent content requests.

   To further alleviate the problems caused by forged fragments or
   Interest initiations, proper protective mechanisms for accessing the
   link-layer should be deployed.

12.  IANA Considerations

12.1.  Reserving Space in the 6LoWPAN Dispatch Type Field Registry

   IANA has assigned dispatch values of the "6LoWPAN Dispatch Type
   Field" registry [RFC4944][RFC8025] with Page TBD1 for NDN and values
   with Page TBD2 for CCNx.  Table 1 represents updates to the registry.

Appendix A.  Estimated Size Reduction

   In the following a theoretical evaluation is given to estimate the
   gains of ICN LoWPAN compared to uncompressed CCNx and NDN messages.

   We assume that "n" is the number of name components, "comps_n"
   denotes the sum of n name component lengths.  We also assume that the
   length of each name component is lower than 16 bytes.  The length of
   the content is given by "clen".  The lengths of TLV components is
   specific to the CCNx or NDN encoding and outlined below.

A.1.  NDN

   The NDN TLV encoding has variable-sized TLV fields.  For simplicity,
   the 1 octet form of each TLV component is assumed.  A typical TLV
   component therefore is of size 2 (type field + length field) + the
   actual value.

A.1.1.  Interest

   Figure 36 depicts the size requirements for a basic, uncompressed NDN
   Interest containing a CanBePrefix TLV, a MustBeFresh TLV, a
   InterestLifetime TLV set to 4 seconds and a HopLimit TLV set to 6.
   Numbers below represent the amount of octets.

         ------------------------------------,
         Interest TLV            = 2         |
           ---------------------,            |
           Name                 |  2 +       |
             NameComponents      = 2n +      |
                                |  comps_n   |
           ---------------------'             = 21 + 2n + comps_n
           CanBePrefix           = 2         |
           MustBeFresh           = 2         |
           Nonce                 = 6         |
           InterestLifetime      = 4         |
           HopLimit              = 3         |

          Figure 37: Estimated size of a compressed NDN Interest

   The size difference is:
   12 + 1.5n octets.

   For the name "/DE/HH/HAW/BT7", the total size gain is 18 octets,
   which is 46% of the uncompressed packet.

A.1.2.  Data

   Figure 38 depicts the size requirements for a basic, uncompressed NDN
   Data containing a FreshnessPeriod as MetaInfo.  A FreshnessPeriod of
   1 minute is assumed and the value is encoded using 1 octet.  An
   HMACWithSha256 is assumed as signature.  The key locator is assumed
   to contain a Name TLV of length klen.

A.2.2.  Content Object

   Figure 42 depicts the size requirements for a basic, uncompressed
   CCNx Content Object containing an ExpiryTime Message TLV, an
   HMAC_SHA-256 signature, the signature time and a hash of the shared
   secret key.  In the fixed header, the protocol version is assumed to
   be 1 and the reserved field is assumed to be 0

        Figure 43: Estimated size of a compressed CCNx Data Object

   The size difference is:
   35 + 3.5n octets.

   For the name "/DE/HH/HAW/BT7", the size is reduced by 70 octets,
   which is 40% of the uncompressed packet containing a 4-octet payload.

Acknowledgments

   This work was stimulated by fruitful discussions in the ICNRG
   research group and the communities of RIOT and CCNlite.  We would
   like to thank all active members for constructive thoughts and
   feedback.  In particular, the authors would like to thank (in
   alphabetical order) Peter Kietzmann, Dirk Kutscher, Martine Lenders,
   Colin Perkins, Junxiao Shi. The hop-wise stateful name compression
   was brought up in a discussion by Dave Oran, which is gratefully
   acknowledged.  Larger parts of this work are inspired by [RFC4944]
   and [RFC6282].  Special mentioning goes to Mark Mosko as well as G.Q.
   Wang and Ravi Ravindran as their previous work in [TLV-ENC-802.15.4]
   and [WIRE-FORMAT-CONSID] provided a good base for our discussions on
   stateless header compression mechanisms.  This work was supported in
   part by the German Federal Ministry of Research and Education within
   the projects I3 and RAPstore.
