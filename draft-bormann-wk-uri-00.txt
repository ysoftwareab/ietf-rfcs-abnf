     Recording Well-Known URI Capability in the URI Scheme Registry
                        draft-bormann-wk-uri-00

Abstract

   RFC 5785 defines a path prefix, "/.well-known/", that can be used by
   well-known URIs, specifically for the "http" and "https" URI schemes,
   which has since been adopted by other URI schemes.  The present memo
   formally updates RFC 7595, which defines the URI schemes regustry, to
   record the availability of these well-known URIs to the URI schemes
   registered there.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5785] defines a path prefix, "/.well-known", that can be used by
   well-known URIs, as well as an IANA registry for URI suffixes to be
   used with this path prefix for forming well-known URIs.

   In [RFC5785], this mechanism is specifically defined for the "http"
   and "https" URI schemes (now defined in [RFC7230]).  Other URI
   schemes such as "coap" and "coaps" [RFC7252] have since picked up
   this mechanism, sharing the registry of URI suffixes with that for
   HTTP(S).

   [RFC7595], which defines the URI scheme registry [IANA.uri-schemes],
   does not foresee recording the availability of well-known URIs for a
   scheme being registered.  Hence, there is no central reference that
   can easily be used to find out which schemes do support well-known
   URIs.

   The present memo formally updates [RFC7595] to record the
   availability of these well-known URIs to the URI schemes registered
   in [IANA.uri-schemes].

2.  IANA considerations

   IANA is requested to add a column to the Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) Schemes Registry [IANA.uri-schemes] labeled "Well-Known URI
   OK", with a default value of "-".  If a URI scheme explicitly has
   been specified to use well-known URIs as per Section 3 of [RFC5785],
   the value changes to a reference to that specification.  Initial
   values not equal to "-" are given in Table 1.

3.  Security considerations

   The Security Considerations of [RFC5785] apply and need to be
   considered for all well-known URIs.
