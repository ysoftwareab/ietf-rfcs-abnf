1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


2.  Introduction

   This document provides a guide to and template for the creation of
   new IANA registrations of Enumservices.  This document aims to
   enhance section 3 of RFC 3761 [2], where the registration procedure
   for Enumservices was initially documented at a high level.  However,
   the IETF's ENUM Working Group has encountered an unnecessary amount
   of variation in the format of Enumservice drafts presented to the
   group.  The ENUM Working Group's view of what particular fields and
   information are required and/or recommended has also evolved, and
   capturing these best current practices is helpful in both the
   creation of new registrations, as well as the revision or refinement
   of existing registrations.

   [-00 Note: This is an early draft version.]


3.  Required Sections and Information

   In addition to the typical sections required for an RFC as outlined
   in RFC 2223bis [3] (Instructions to RFC Authors), there are several
   sections which MUST appear in an IANA Registration for an
   Enumservice.  These sections are, as follows, and SHOULD be in the
   following order:

3.1.  Introduction (MANDATORY)

   An introductory section MUST be included.  This section will explain,
   in plain English, the purpose of and intended usage of the proposed
   Enumservice registration.

3.2.  Enumservice Registration for "foo" with Subtype "bar" (MANDATORY)

   This section MUST be included in an Enumservice registration.  In
   addition, where a given registration type has multiple subtypes,
   there MUST be a separate registration section for each subtype.  The
   following lists the sections and order of an Enumservice Registration
   section.  All types and subtypes SHOULD be listed in lower-case.

   Enumservice Name: "foo"

Internet-Draft        BCP Enumservice Registrations             Feb 2006


   Enumservice Type: "foo"

   Enumservice Subtype: "bar"

   URI Schemes: "bar:"

   Functional Specification:

      This Enumservice indicates that the remote resource identified can
      be addressed by the associated URI scheme in order to foo the bar.

   Security Considerations: See Section Section 3.5
      (a reference internal to a given registration document).

   Intended Usage: COMMON

      [-00 Note: Authors to explain the choices here in a later
      revision.]

   Authors:

      Madeline Smith and Katie Jones (for author contact detail see
      Authors' Addresses section).

   Any other information the author deems interesting:

      None

3.3.  Examples (MANDATORY)

   This section MUST show one or more example(s) of the Enumservice
   registration, for illustrative purposes.  The example(s) shall in no
   way limit the various forms that a given Enumservice may take and
   this should be noted at the beginning of this section of the
   document.  The example(s) MUST show the specific formatting of the
   intended NAPTRs [4], including one or more NAPTR example(s), AND a
   brief textual description, consisting of one or more sentences
   written in plain English, explaining the various parts or attributes
   of the record.

3.4.  Implementation Recommendations / Notes (OPTIONAL)

   If at all possible, recommendations that pertain to implemention
   and/or operations SHOULD be included.  Such a section is helpful to
   someone reading a registration and trying to understand how best to
   use it to support their network or service.

Internet-Draft        BCP Enumservice Registrations             Feb 2006


3.5.  Security Considerations (MANDATORY)

   A section explaining any potential security threats that are unique
   to the given registration MUST be included.  This MUST also include
   any information about access to Personally Identifiable Information
   (PII).  However, this section should not intended as a general
   security Best Current Practices (BCP) document or include general and
   obvious security recommendations, such as securing servers with
   strong password authentication.

3.6.  IANA Considerations (MANDATORY)

   [-00 Note: Will be exapanded in an upcoming revision.]

3.7.  Other Sections (OPTIONAL)

   Other sections, beyond those required by the IETF and/or IANA, which
   are cited or otherwise referenced here, MAY be included in an
   Enumservice registration.  These sections may relate to the specifics
   of the intended usage of the Enumservice registration and associated
   technical, operational, or administrative concerns.


4.  Blank Enumservice Template

   Appendix A contains a template which can be used to create Internet
   Drafts and RFC by means described on http://xml.resource.org/.


5.  Revision of Pre-Existing Enumservice RFCs

   Several Enumservice registrations, published via IETF RFCs, already
   exist at the time of the development of this document.  The authors
   recommend that these existing registration documents SHOULD be
   reviewed and, where necessary and appropriate, MAY be revised in
   accordance with the recommendations contained herein.  All future
   Enumservice registrations SHOULD follow the recommendations contained
   herein, where practical and applicable.


6.  Acknowledgements

   The authors wish to thank Alexander Mayrhofer for his review and
   feedback.
