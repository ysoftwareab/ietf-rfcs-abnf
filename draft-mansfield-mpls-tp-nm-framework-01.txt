1. Introduction 

   This document provides a framework for using the MPLS-TP NM 
   requirements [1] for managing the elements and networks that 
   support a Transport Profile for MPLS. 

1.1. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described 
   in RFC 2119 [3]. 

   Communication Channel (CC): a logical channel between network 
   elements (NEs) that can be used - e.g. - management plane 
   applications or control plane applications. The physical channel 
   supporting the CC is technology specific. An example of physical 
   channels supporting the CC is a DCC channel within SDH. 

   Data Communication Network (DCN): a network that supports Layer 
   1 (physical), Layer 2 (data-link), and Layer 3 (network) 
   functionality for distributed management communications related 
   to the management plane, for distributed signaling 
   communications related to the control plane, and other 
   operations communications (e.g., order-wire/voice 
   communications, software downloads, etc.).  

   Equipment Management Function (EMF): the management functions 
   within an NE. See ITU-T G.7710 [2]. 

   Local Craft Terminal (LCT):  An out-of-band device that connects 
   to an NE for management purposes. 

   Management Application Function (MAF): An application process 
   that participates in system management. See ITU-T G.7710 [2]. 

   Management Communication Channel (MCC): a CC dedicated for 
   management plane communications. 

   Message Communication Function (MCF): The communications process 
   that performs functions such as information interchange and 
   relay. See ITU-T M.3013 [10]. 

   Management Communication Network (MCN): A DCN supporting 
   management plane communication is referred to as a Management 
   Communication Network (MCN).

   MPLS-TP NE: a network element (NE) that supports MPLS-TP 
   functions. 

   MPLS-TP network: a network in which MPLS-TP NEs are deployed. 

   Network Element Function (NEF):  The set of functions necessary 
   to manage a network element. 

   Operations System (OS): A system that performs the functions 
   that support processing of information related to operations, 
   administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAM&P) for the 
   networks, including surveillance and testing functions to 
   support customer access maintenance. 

   Signaling Communication Network (SCN): A DCN supporting control 
   plane communication is referred to as a Signaling Communication 
   Network (SCN). 

   Signaling Communication Channel (SCC): a CC dedicated for 
   control plane communications. The SCC may be used for GMPLS/ASON 
   signaling and/or other control plane messages (e.g., routing 
   messages). 

2. Management Architecture Consideration 

   The management of the MPLS-TP network could be based on a multi-
   tiered distributed management systems, for example as described 
   in ITU-T M.3010 [7] and M.3060 [8]. Each tier provides a 
   predefined level of network management capabilities. The lowest 
   tier of this organization model includes the MPLS-TP Network 
   Element that provides the transport service and the Operations 
   System (OS) at the Element Management Level. The management 
   application function within the NEs and OSs provides the 
   management support. The management application function at each 
   entity can include agents only, managers only, or both agents 
   and managers. The management application function that include 
   managers are capable of managing an agent included in other 
   management application functions. 

   The management communication to peer NEs and/or Operations 
   System (OSs) is provided via the message communication function 
   within each entity (e.g. NE and OS). The user can access the 
   management of the MPLS-TP transport network via a Local Craft 
   Terminal (LCT) attached to the NE or via a Work Station (WS) 
   attached to the OS.

2.1.Network Management Architecture 

   A transport Management Network (MN) MAY consist of several 
   transport technology specific Management Networks. Figure 1 
   below from G.7710 [2] shows an example of management network 
   partitioning.  Notation used in G.7710 for a transport 
   technology specific MN is x.MN, where x is the transport 
   specific technology.  In the example "O.MSN" is equivalent to an 
   optical management subnetwork, and "S.MSN" is equivalent to an 
   SDH management subnetwork.  A MPLS-TP specific MN might be 
   abbreviated as MPLS-TP.MN.  Where there is no ambiguity, we will 
   use "MN" for an MPLS-TP specific MN, and "MPLS-TP.MN" (or "MPLS-
   TP MN") and "MN" where both are used in a given context.

                 Figure 1 Management Network Partitioning 

   The management of the MPLS-TP network is be separable from the 
   management of the other technology-specific networks, and 
   operate independently of any particular client or server layer 
   management plane. 

   A MPLS-TP Management Network could be partitioned into MPLS-TP 
   Management SubNetworks ("MPLS-TP.MSN" or "MPLS-TP MSN", or just 
   "MSN" where usage is unambiguous) for consideration of 
   scalability (e.g. geographic or load balancing) or 
   administrative (e.g. administrative or ownership). 

   The MPLS-TP MSN could be connected to other parts of the MN 
   through one or more LCTs and/or OSs. The message communication 
   function (MCF) of an MPLS-TP NE initiates/terminates, routes, or 
   otherwise processes management messages over CCs or via an 
   external interface.

   Multiple addressable MPLS-TP NEs could be present at a single 
   physical location (i.e. site or office). The inter-site 
   communications link between the MPLS-TP NEs will normally be 
   provided by the CCs. Within a particular site, the NEs could 
   communicate via an intra-site CC or via a LAN. 

2.2. Element Management Architecture 

   The Equipment Management Function (EMF) of a MPLS-TP NE provides 
   the means through which a management system manages the NE.  

   The EMF interacts with the NE's transport functions and control 
   functions (i.e., control plane functions that reside in the NE) 
   by exchanging Management Information (MI) across the Management 
   Point (MP) Reference Points. The EMF may contain a number of 
   functions that provide a data reduction mechanism on the 
   information received across the MP Reference Points. 

   The EMF includes functions such as Date & Time and the FCAPS 
   (Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance and Security) 
   management functions.  The EMF provides event message 
   processing, data storage and logging. The management Agent, a 
   component of the EMF, converts internal management information 
   (MI signals) into Management Application messages and vice 
   versa. The Agent responds to Management Application messages 
   from the message communication function by performing the 
   appropriate operations on (for example) the Managed Objects in a 
   Management Information Base (MIB), as necessary. The message 
   communication function contains communications functions related 
   to the outside world of the NE (i.e. Date & Time source, 
   Management Plane, Control Plane, Local Craft Terminal and Local 
   Alarms). 

   The Date & Time functions keep track of the NE's date/time which 
   is used by the FCAPS management functions to e.g. time stamp 
   event reports. 

   Below are diagrams that illustrate the components of the element 
   management function of a network element.  Figure 2 provides the 
   breakdown of the Network Element Function, then Figure 3 
   provides the details of Equipment Management Function, and 
   finally Figure 4 details the Message Communication Function.

2.3.Standard Management Interfaces 

   The MPLS-TP NM requirement document [1] places no restriction 
   on which management interface is to be used for managing an 
   MPLS-TP network.  It is possible to provision and manage an 
   end-to-end connection across a network where some segments are 
   created/managed/deleted, for example by netconf/XML or snmp/smi 
   and other segments by CORBA/IDL interfaces.  Use of any network 
   management interface for one management related purpose does 
   not preclude use of another network management interface for

   other management related purposes, or the same purpose at 
   another time.  However, an MPLS-TP NE is not expected to 
   actively support more than one management protocol in any given 
   deployment.  The protocol to be supported is at the discretion 
   of the operator. 

2.4. Management and Control specific terminology 

   Data Communication Network (DCN) is the common term for the network 
   used to transport Management and Signaling information between: 
   management systems and network elements, management systems to other 
   management systems, and networks elements to other network elements.  
   The Management Communications Network (MCN) is the part of the DCN 
   which supports the transport of Management information for the 
   Management Plane.  The Signaling Communications Network (SCN) is the 
   part of the DCN which supports transport for signaling information 
   for the Control Plane.  As shown in Figure 5 each technology has its 
   own terminology that is used for the channels that support management 
   and control plane information transfer.  For MPLS-TP, the management 
   plane uses the Management Communication Channel (MCC) and the control 
   plane uses the Signaling Communication Channel (SCC). 

2.5. Management Channel 

   The Communication Channel (CC) provides a logical channel 
   between NEs for transferring Management and/or Signaling 
   information. Note that some technologies provide separate 
   communication channels for Management (MCC) and Signaling (SCC).   

     . MPLS-TP NEs communicate via the DCN. The DCN connects NEs 
        with management systems, NEs with NEs, and management 
        systems with management systems.

3. Fault Management Considerations 

   A fault is the inability of a function to perform a required action.  
   This does not include an inability due to preventive maintenance, 
   lack of external resources, or planned actions.  Fault management 
   provides the mechanisms to detect, verify, isolate, notify, and 
   recover from the fault. 

3.1. Supervision 

   G.7710 [2] lists five basic categories of supervision that provide 
   the functionality necessary to detect, verify, and notify a fault.  
   The categories are:  Transmission Supervision, Quality of Service 
   Supervision, Processing Supervision, Hardware Supervision, and 
   Environment Supervision.  Each of the categories provides a set of 
   recommendations to ensure the fault management process is fulfilled. 

3.2. Validation 

   G.7710 [2] describes a fault cause as a limited interruption of the 
   required function.  It is not reasonable for every fault cause to be 
   reported to maintenance personnel.  The validation process is used to 
   turn fault causes (events) into failures (alarms). 

3.3. Alarm Handling 

   Within an element management system, it is important to consider 
   mechanisms to support severity assignment, alarm reporting control, 
   and logging. 

4. Configuration Management Considerations 

   Configuration management provides the mechanisms to provision the 
   MPLS-TP services, setup security for the MPLS-TP services and MPLS-TP 
   network elements, and provides the destination for fault 
   notifications and performance parameters.  Inventory reporting is 
   also considered part of configuration management. 

   Associated with configuration management are hardware and software 
   provisioning and inventory reporting. 

4.1. LSP ownership handover 

   MPLS-TP networks can be managed not only by Network Management 
   Systems (i.e. management plane), but also by control plane protocols. 

 
 
Mansfield, et al       Expires October 23, 2009           [Page 13] 

     Internet-Draft           MPLS-TP NM Framework       April 23, 2009 
    

   The utilization of the control plane is not a mandatory requirement 
   (see MPLS-TP Requirements [4]) but it is often used by network 
   operators in order to make network configuration and LSP recovery 
   both faster and simpler.  

   In networks where both CP and MP are provided, an LSP could be 
   created by either (CP or MP).  The entity creating an LSP owns the 
   data plane resources comprising that LSP.  Only the owner of an LSP 
   is typically able modify/delete it.  This results in a need for 
   interaction between the MP and CP to allow either to manage all the 
   resources of a network. 

   Network operators might prefer to have full control of the network 
   resources during the set-up phase and then allow the network to be 
   automatically maintained by the control plane. This can be achieved 
   by creating LSPs via the management plane and subsequently 
   transferring LSP ownership to the control plane. This is referred to 
   as "ownership handover" [9].  MP to CP ownership handover is then 
   considered a requirement [9] where a control plane is in use that 
   supports it.  The converse (CP to MP ownership handover) is a feature 
   that is recommended - but not required - for (G)MPLS networks because 
   it has only minor applications (for example moving LSPs from one path 
   to another as a maintenance operation). 

   The LSP handover procedure has already been standardized for GMPLS 
   networks, where the signaling protocol used is RSVP-TE [5]. The 
   utilization of RSVP-TE enhancements are defined in [6].  

   MP and CP interworking includes also the exchange of information that 
   is either requested by the MP, or a notification by the CP as a 
   consequence of a request from the MP or an automatic action (for 
   example a failure occurs or an operation is performed). The CP is 
   asked to notify the MP in a reliable manner about the status of the 
   operations it performs and to provide a mechanism to monitor the 
   status of control plane objects (e.g. TE Link status, available 
   resources), and to log control plane LSP related operations. Logging 
   is one of the most critical aspects because the MP always needs to 
   have an accurate history and status of each LSP and all data plane 
   resources involved in it. 

5. Performance Management Considerations 

   Performance statistics can overwhelm a management network, so it is 
   important to provide flexible instrumentation that provides control 
   over the amount of performance data to be collected.  A distinction 
   is made between performance data that is collected on-demand and data 
   that is collected proactively.  On-demand measurement provides the 
 
 
Mansfield, et al       Expires October 23, 2009           [Page 14] 

     Internet-Draft           MPLS-TP NM Framework       April 23, 2009 
    

   operator the ability to issue a command to initiate a measurement.  
   Proactive measurement is something that happens continuously over 
   time after being configured with a periodicity and storage 
   requirements.  Data collected from proactive measurement are usually 
   used for verifying the performance of the LSP service, while data 
   collected from on-demand measurement are usually used for maintenance 
   purposes such as diagnose or to provide detailed verification of  
   proactive measurement. 

6. Security Considerations 

   Provisions to any of the network mechanisms designed to satisfy 
   the requirements described herein are required to prevent their 
   unauthorized use.  Likewise, these network mechanisms MUST 
   provide a means by which an operator can prevent denial of 
   service attacks if those network mechanisms are used in such an 
   attack. 

   Solutions MUST provide mechanisms to prevent private     
   information from being accessed by unauthorized eavesdropping,     
   or being directly obtained by an unauthenticated network     
   element, system or user. 

   Performance of diagnostic functions and path characterization 
   involves extracting a significant amount of information about 
   network construction that the network operator MAY consider 
   private.
