2. Introduction
   
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information
   Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes
   managed objects for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   [RFC3031] and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (GMPLS) [GMPLSArch] Label Switching Routers (LSRs).
   
   Comments should be made directly to the CCAMP mailing

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
   "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in RFC 2119, reference
   [RFC2119].


2.1.  Migration Strategy
   
   This MIB is built upon the Label Switching Router MIB
   defined for use with MPLS [LSRMIB]. The only changes made
   are additions for support of GMPLS or changes that are
   necessary to support the increased complexity of a GMPLS
   system.
   
   In all cases, these changes have been made such that
   migration from [LSRMIB] to this MIB will be as simple as
   possible.
   
   Note that this MIB may be used in systems that support
   MPLS, GMPLS or both.
   
   This MIB may be seen as a replacement for the MPLS LSR
   MIB [LSRMIB] in systems which support GMPLS, but it is
   not a requirement that it replace the MPLS LSR MIB in
   systems that only support MPLS.
   
   The companion document modeling and managing GMPLS based
   traffic engineering [GMPLSTEMIB] is based on the MPLS TE
   MIB [TEMIB] with the same intentions.  It is not expected
   that a system would mix MPLS and GMPLS MIBs.
   
   Textual conventions and OBJECT-IDENTIFIERS are defined in
   [GMPLSTCMIB] which extends the set of textual conventions
   originally defined in [TCMIB].
   
   See section 11.1 for a description of how the
   gmplsLabelTable may be omitted in systems that support
   MPLS only.


3. The SNMP Management Framework
   
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five
   major components:
   
   -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571
      [RFC2571].

Internet Draft               GMPLS LSR MIB               January 2002



   
   -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and
      events for the purpose of management.  The first
      version of this Structure of Management Information
      (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC
      1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and STD 16,
      RFC 1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2,
      is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58,
      RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].
   
   -  Message protocols for transferring management
      information.  The first version of the SNMP message
      protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC
      1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the SNMP message
      protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
      [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version
      of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described
      in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574
      [RFC2574].
   
   -  Protocol operations for accessing management
      information.  The first set of protocol operations and
      associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC
      1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol operations
      and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [RFC1905].
   
   -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC
      2573 [RFC2573] and the view-based access control
      mechanism described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].
   
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP
   Management Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
   store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
   defined in the SMI.
   
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the
   SMIv2.  A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced
   through the appropriate translations.  The resulting
   translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except
   where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into
   textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation
   process.  However, this loss of machine readable
   information is not considered to change the semantics of

   the MIB.


4. Terminology
   
   This document uses terminology from the document
   describing the MPLS architecture [RFC3031].
   
   A label switched path (LSP) is modeled as a connection
   consisting of one or more incoming segments (in-segments)
   and/or one or more outgoing segments (out-segments) at a
   Label Switching Router (LSR).  The association or
   interconnection of the in-segments and out-segments is
   accomplished by using a cross-connect.  We use the
   terminology "connection" and "LSP" interchangeably where
   the meaning is clear from the context.


5. Feature List
   
   The GMPLS Label Switching Router MIB is designed to
   satisfy the following requirements and constraints:
   
   -  The MIB supports both manually configured LSPs as well
      as those configured via any MPLS or GMPLS signaling
      protocol.
   
   -  The MIB supports the enabling and disabling of MPLS
      capability on MPLS capable interfaces of an LSR.
   
   -  The MIB allows resource sharing between two or more
      LSPs.
   
   -  Both per-platform and per-interface label spaces are
      supported.
   
   -  Forwarding can be performed solely based on an
      incoming top label [RFC3031, RFC3032].
   
   -  Support is provided for next-hop resolution when the
      outgoing interface is a shared media interface.  In
      the point-to-multipoint case, each outgoing segment
      can reside on a different shared media interface.
   
   -  The MIB supports point-to-point, point-to-multipoint
      and multipoint-to-point connections at an LSR.
   
   -  For multipoint-to-point connections all outgoing
      packets can have the same top label.

Internet Draft               GMPLS LSR MIB               January 2002



   -  For multipoint-to-point connections, the outgoing
      resources of the merged connections can be shared.
   
   -  For multipoint-to-point connections, packets from
      different incoming connections can have distinct
      outgoing label stacks beneath the (identical) top
      label.
   
   -  In the point-to-multipoint case each outgoing
      connection can have a distinct label stack including
      the top label.
   
   -  All the members of a point-to-multipoint connection
      can share the resources allocated for the ingress
      segments.
   
   -  The MIB provides cross-connect capability to "pop" an
      incoming label and forward the packet with the
      remainder of the label stack unchanged and without
      pushing any labels ("pop-and-go") [RFC3032].
   
   -  The MIB supports persistent as well as non-persistent
      LSPs.
   
   -  Performance counters are provided for in-segments and
      out-segments as well as for measuring performance on a
      per-interface basis.


6. Outline
   
   Configuring LSPs through an LSR involves the following
   steps:
   
   -  Enabling MPLS on MPLS capable interfaces.
   
   -  Configuring in-segments and out-segments.
   
   -  Setting up the cross-connect table to associate
      segments and/or to indicate connection origination and
      termination.
   
   -  Optionally specifying label stack actions.
   
   -  Optionally specifying segment traffic parameters.


6.1.  Summary of LSR MIB
   
   The MIB objects for performing these actions consist of

Internet Draft               GMPLS LSR MIB               January 2002



   the following tables:
   
   -  The interface configuration table
      (gmplsInterfaceConfTable), which is used for enabling
      the MPLS protocol on MPLS-capable interfaces.
   
   -  The in-segment (gmplsInSegmentTable) and out-segment
      (gmplsOutSegmentTable) tables, which are used for
      configuring LSP segments at an LSR.
   
   -  The cross-connect table (gmplsXCTable), which is used
      to associate in and out segments together, in order to
      form a cross-connect.
   
   -  The label stack table (gmplsLabelStackTable), which is
      used for specifying label stack operations.
   
   -  The Traffic Parameter table (gmplsTrafficParamTable),
      which is used for specifying LSP-related traffic
      parameters.
   
   Further, the in-segment and out-segment performance
   tables, gmplsInSegmentPerfTable and
   gmplsOutSegmentPerfTable, contain the objects necessary
   to measure the performance of LSPs, and
   gmplsInterfacePerfTable has objects to measure
   performance on a per-interface basis.
   
   These tables are described in the subsequent sections.


7. Brief Description of MIB Objects
   
   Sections 7.1-7.2 describe objects pertaining to MPLS-
   capable interfaces of an LSR.  The objects described in
   Sections 7.3-7.8, were derived from the Incoming Label
   Map (ILM) and Next Hop Label Forwarding Entry (NHLFE) as
   specified in the MPLS architecture document [RFC3031].
   Section 7.9 describes objects for specifying traffic
   parameters for in and out segments. It is appropriate to
   note that the in-segment, out-segment, and cross-connect
   tables were modeled after similar tables found in
   [RFC2515].


7.1.  gmplsInterfaceConfTable
   
   This table represents the interfaces that are MPLS or
   GMPLS capable.  An LSR creates an entry in this table for
   every such interface on that LSR.



Nadeau et al.                Expires July 2002               [Page 8]

Internet Draft               GMPLS LSR MIB               January 2002





7.2.  gmplsInterfacePerfTable
   
   This table contains objects to measure the performance of
   MPLS and GMPLS capable interfaces and is an AUGMENT to
   gmplsInterfaceConfTable.  High capacity counters are
   provided for objects that are likely to wrap around
   quickly on high-speed interfaces.


7.3.  gmplsInSegmentTable
   
   This table contains a description of the incoming
   segments to an LSR and their associated parameters.
   
   The administrative and operational status objects for
   this table are used to control packet transmission on
   this segment.  If either the administrative or
   operational status objects for this table is set to
   'down', this implies that packets will not be forwarded.
   Likewise, if the values are set to 'up' this implies that
   packets are forwarded.  These values are particularly
   useful in cases where multi-point connections utilize a
   single cross-connect and the administrator wishes to
   disable some, but not all of the streams.  In these
   cases, the administrator may set the administrative
   status object to 'down' on some of the in-segments.


7.4.  gmplsInSegmentPerfTable
   
   The In-Segment Performance Table has objects to measure
   the performance of an incoming segment configured on an
   LSR.  It is an AUGMENT to gmplsInSegmentTable.  High
   capacity counters are provided for objects that are
   likely to wrap around quickly on high-speed interfaces.


7.5.  gmplsOutSegmentTable
   
   The Out-Segment Table contains a description of the
   outgoing segments at an LSR and their associated
   parameters.  The administrative and operational status
   objects for this table are used to control packet
   transmission on this segment.  If either the
   administrative or operational status objects is set to
   'down', this implies that packets will not be forwarded.
   Likewise, if the values are set to 'up' this implies that
   packets are forwarded.  These values are particularly

Internet Draft               GMPLS LSR MIB               January 2002



   useful in cases where multicast connections utilize a
   single cross-connect and the administrator wishes to
   disable some, but not all of the streams.  In these
   cases, the administrator may set the administrative
   status object to 'down' on some of the out-segments.


7.6.  gmplsOutSegmentPerfTable
   
   The Out-Segment Table contains objects to measure the
   performance of an outgoing segment configured on an LSR.
   It is an AUGMENT to gmplsOutSegmentTable.  High capacity
   counters are provided for objects that are likely to wrap
   around quickly on high-speed interfaces.


7.7.  gmplsXCTable
   
   The gmplsXCTable specifies information for associating
   segments together in order to instruct the LSR to switch
   between the specified segments.  It supports point-to-
   point, point-to-multi-point and multi-point-to-point
   connections.
   
   The administrative and operational status objects for
   this table imply control of packet forwarding to and from
   a XCEntry.  When the administrative and operational
   status objects are set to 'down' for example, this
   implies that the specified XCEntry will not forward
   packets.  Likewise, when either is set to 'up' this
   implies that packets will be forwarded.


7.8.  gmplsLabelStackTable
   
   The gmplsLabelStackTable specifies the label stack to be
   pushed onto a packet, beneath the top label.  Entries to
   this table are referred to from gmplsXCTable.


7.9.  gmplsTrafficParamTable
   
   The gmplsTrafficParamTable contains objects for
   specifying the traffic parameters of in-segments and out-
   segments.  Entries in this table are referred to from
   gmplsInSegmentTable and gmplsOutSegmentTable.


8. Bidirectional LSPs

Internet Draft               GMPLS LSR MIB               January 2002



   This MIB supports bidirectional LSPs as required for
   GMPLS.
   
   A single entry in the gmplsXCIndex is shared by all of
   the segments for the entire bidirectional LSP.  This
   facilitates a simple reference from [GMPLSTEMIB] and
   makes fate-sharing more obvious.
   
   It is, however, important that the direction of segments
   is understood to avoid connecting all in-segments to all
   out-segments.  This is achieved by an object in each
   segment that indicates the direction of the segment with
   respect to data flow.
   
   A segment that is marked as 'forward' carries data from
   the 'head' of the LSP to the 'tail'.  A segment marked as
   'reverse' carries data in the reverse direction.
   
   Where an LSP is signaled using a conventional signaling
   protocol, the 'head' of the LSP is the source of the
   signaling (also known as the ingress) and the 'tail' is
   the destination (also known as the egress).  For manually
   configured LSPs an arbitrary decision must be made about
   which segments are 'forward' and which 'reverse'.  For
   consistency this decision should be made across all LSRs
   that participate in the LSP by assigning 'head' and
   'tail' ends to the LSP.


9. Example of LSP Setup
   
   In this section we provide a brief example of using the
   MIB objects described in section 12. to set up an LSP.
   While this example is not meant to illustrate every
   nuance of the MIB, it is intended as an aid to
   understanding some of the key concepts.  It is meant to
   be read after going through the MIB itself.
   
   Suppose that one would like to manually create a best-
   effort, bi-directional LSP.  Assume that, in the forward
   direction, the LSP enters the LSR via MPLS interface A
   with ifIndex 12 and exits the LSR via MPLS interface B
   with ifIndex 13.  For the reverse direction, we assume
   the LSP enters via interface B and leaves via interface A
   (i.e. the forward and reverse directions use the same bi-
   directional interfaces).  Let us also assume that we do
   not wish to have a label stack beneath the top label on
   the outgoing labeled packets.  The following example
   illustrates which rows and corresponding objects might be
   created to accomplish this.

   First, the traffic parameter entries must be set-up for
   both segments.
   
   In gmplsTrafficParamTable for the incoming direction:
   {
     gmplsTrafficParamIndex           = 5
     gmplsTrafficParamMaxRate         = 100000,
     gmplsTrafficParamMeanRate        = 100000,
     gmplsTrafficParamMaxBurstSize    = 2000,
     gmplsTrafficParamRowStatus       = createAndGo(4)
   }
   
   In gmplsTrafficParamTable for the outgoing direction:
   {
     gmplsTrafficParamIndex           = 6
     gmplsTrafficParamMaxRate         = 100000,
     gmplsTrafficParamMeanRate        = 100000,
     gmplsTrafficParamMaxBurstSize    = 2000,
     gmplsTrafficParamRowStatus       = createAndGo(4)
   }
   
   Note that for a bi-directional LSP, the segments in the
   reverse direction can share the traffic parameter entries
   (and hence resources) with the segments in the forward
   direction.
   
   We must next create the appropriate in-segment and out-
   segment entries with suitable traffic parameters by
   pointing to the appropriate traffic parameter entries
   that we have just created.
   
   First for the forward direction:
   
   In gmplsInSegmentTable
   {
     gmplsInSegmentIndex           = 1,
     -- incoming interface
     gmplsInSegmentIfIndex         = 12,
     -- incoming label
     gmplsInSegmentLabel           = 21,
     gmplsInSegmentNPop            = 1,
     gmplsInSegmentOwner           = snmp (2),
     gmplsInSegmentTrafficParamPtr =
                          gmplsTrafficParamIndex.5,
     gmplsInSegmentDirection       = forward (1),
     gmplsInSegmentRowStatus       = createAndGo(4)
   }
   
   In gmplsOutSegmentTable

     gmplsOutSegmentPushTopLabel    = true(1),
     -- outgoing label
     gmplsOutSegmentTopLabel        = 22,
     gmplsOutSegmentOwner           = snmp (2),
     gmplsOutSegmentTrafficParamPtr =
                           gmplsTrafficParamIndex.6,
     gmplsOutSegmentDirection       = forward (1),
     gmplsOutSegmentRowStatus       = createAndGo(4)
   }
   
   Next for the reverse direction:
   
   In gmplsInSegmentTable
   {
     gmplsInSegmentIndex           = 2,
     -- incoming interface
     gmplsInSegmentIfIndex         = 13,

     gmplsInSegmentLabel           = 31,
     gmplsInSegmentNPop            = 1,
     gmplsInSegmentOwner           = snmp (2),
     gmplsInSegmentTrafficParamPtr =
                          gmplsTrafficParamIndex.6,
     gmplsInSegmentDirection       = reverse (2),
     gmplsInSegmentRowStatus       = createAndGo(4)
   }
   
   In gmplsOutSegmentTable
   {
     gmplsOutSegmentIndex           = 2,
     -- outgoing interface
     gmplsOutSegmentIfIndex         = 12,
     gmplsOutSegmentPushTopLabel    = true(1),
     -- outgoing label
     gmplsOutSegmentTopLabel        = 32,
   
     gmplsOutSegmentOwner           = snmp (2),
     gmplsOutSegmentTrafficParamPtr =
                           gmplsTrafficParamIndex.5,
     gmplsOutSegmentDirection       = reverse (2),
     gmplsOutSegmentRowStatus       = createAndGo(4)
   }
   
   Next, two cross-connect entries are created thereby
   associating the newly created segments together.

10.   Application of the Interface Group to MPLS
   
   This memo contains media-specific extensions to the
   Interfaces Group for managing MPLS interfaces and assumes
   the interpretation of the Interfaces Group to be in
   accordance with [RFC2863] which states that the
   interfaces table (ifTable) contains information on the
   managed resource's interfaces and that each sub-layer
   below the internetwork layer of a network interface is
   considered an interface.  Thus, the MPLS interface is
   represented as an entry in the ifTable.  The inter-
   relation of entries in the ifTable is defined by
   Interfaces Stack Group defined in [RFC2863].
   
   When using MPLS interfaces, the interface stack table

   might appear as follows:
   
   +----------------------------------------+
   | MPLS-interface ifType = mpls(166)      +
   +----------------------------------------+
   | Underlying Layer...                    +
   +----------------------------------------+
   
   In the above diagram, "Underlying Layer..." refers to the
   ifIndex of any interface type, which has been defined for
   MPLS interworking.  Examples include ATM, Frame Relay,
   Ethernet, etc.

11.   The Use of RowPointer and Other Cross-References


11.1. RowPointer
   
   RowPointer is a textual convention used to identify a
   conceptual row in an SNMP Table by pointing to one of its



Nadeau et al.               Expires July 2002               [Page 16]

   objects. In this MIB, it is used in gmplsInSegmentTable
   and gmplsOutSegmentTable for the following purposes.
   First, it indicates a particular traffic parameter table.
   An example of such a table is gmplsTrafficParamTable.
   Second, it is used to indicate a specific instance of a
   traffic parameter entry that is associated with a given
   in-segment or out-segment entry. In the in-segment and
   out-segment tables, the trafficParamPtr SHOULD point to
   the first column of the appropriate conceptual row.


11.2. Cross-referencing to the gmplsLabelTable
   
   The gmplsLabelTable [GMPLSLABELMIB] provides a way to
   model labels in a GMPLS system where labels might not be
   simple 32 bit integers.
   
   Several tables in this document (gmplsInterfaceConfTable,
   gmplsInSegmentTable, gmplsOutSegmentTable,
   gmplsLabelStackTable) use arbitrary indexes to point to
   entries in the gmplsLabelTable to indicate specific label
   values.
   
   Since the primary index into gmplsLabelTabel is a simple
   32 bit integer (gmplsLabelIndex), in systems where the
   nature of a label is well-known, and where the label can
   safely be encoded as a 32 bit integer (for example a
   conventional MPLS system), the gmplsLabelTable does not
   need to be supported and the pointers to the
   gmplsLabelTable (gmplsInterfaceLabelMinIn,
   gmplsInterfaceLabelMaxIn, gmplsInterfaceLabelMinOut,
   gmplsInterfaceLabelMaxOut, gmplsInSegmentLabel,
   gmplsOutSegmentTopLabel, gmplsLabelStackLabel) may be
   replaced with the direct label values.
   
   This provides both a good way to support legacy systems
   that implement the previous version of this MIB [LSRMIB],
   and a significant simplification in GMPLS systems that
   are limited to a single, simple label type.
   
   Note that gmplsLabelTable supports concatenated labels
   through the use of a sub-label index
   (gmplsSublabelIndex).

13.   Security Considerations

Internet Draft               GMPLS LSR MIB               January 2002



   It is clear that this MIB is potentially useful for
   monitoring of MPLS and GMPLS LSRs.  This MIB can also be
   used for configuration of certain objects, and anything
   that can be configured can be incorrectly configured,
   with potentially disastrous results.
   
   There are a number of management objects defined in this
   MIB that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or
   read-create. Such objects may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments. The support for
   SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network
   operations.
   
   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that
   may contain information that may be sensitive from a
   business perspective, in that they represent a customer's
   interface to the MPLS network.  Allowing uncontrolled
   access to these objects could result in malicious and
   unwanted disruptions of network traffic or incorrect
   configurations for these customers.  There are no objects
   that are particularly sensitive in their own right, such
   as passwords or monetary amounts.
   
   It is thus important to control even GET access to these
   objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
   object when sending them over the network via SNMP. Not
   all versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure
   environment.
   
   At this writing, no security holes have been identified
   beyond those that SNMP Security [RFC2571] is itself
   intended to address.  These relate to primarily
   controlled access to sensitive information and the
   ability to configure a device - or which might result
   from operator error, which is beyond the scope of any
   security architecture.
   
   SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 are by themselves not a secure
   environment. Even if the network itself is secure (for
   example by using IPSec [RFC2401]), there is no control as
   to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read, change, create and/or delete) the objects
   in this MIB. It is recommended that the implementers
   consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3
   framework. Specifically, the use of the User-based
   Security Model [RFC2574] and the View-based Access
   Control [RFC2575] is recommended. It is then a
   customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB is

   properly configured to give access to the objects only to
   those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to
   indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
