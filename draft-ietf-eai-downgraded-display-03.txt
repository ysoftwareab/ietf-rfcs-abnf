Internet-Draft       Displaying Downgraded Messages        December 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Email Address Internationalization (UTF8SMTP) extension document
   set [RFC4952] [RFC5336] [RFC5335] [RFC5337] expands Email address
   structure, syntax and Email header format.  To avoid rejection of
   internationalized Email messages, the downgrading mechanism [RFC5504]
   converts an internationalized message to a traditional Email message
   when a server in the delivery path does not support the UTF8SMTP
   extension.  The downgraded message is a traditional Email message,
   except the message has "Downgraded-" header fields.

   A perfect reverse-function of the downgrading does not exist because
   the encoding defined in [RFC2047] is not exactly reversible and
   Received header field downgrading may remove FOR clause information.
   The restoration of the downgrading should be done once at the final
   destination of the downgraded message such as MUAs or IMAP servers.
   This document describes the restoration methods for displaying
   downgraded messages in MUAs.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Specialized terms used in this specification are defined in the EAI
   overview [RFC4952] or in [RFC5321][RFC5322], MIME documents [RFC2045]
   [RFC2047] [RFC2183] [RFC2231].

   This document depends on [RFC5335] and [RFC5504].  Key words used in
   these document are used in this document, too.

   The term "MIME decode" is used for both "encoded-word" decoding
   defined by [RFC2047] and MIME parameter value decoding defined by
   [RFC2231].


3.  Converting downgraded message headers for display

3.1.  Considerations

   The order of some header fields (such as "Resent-*" fields) is
   significant.  The process of regenerating the original fields from
   the downgraded ones MUST NOT reorder the fields.

   In order to regenerate a field from a specific downgraded header
   field, it's necessary to find the corresponding replacement in the



Fujiwara & Leiba          Expires June 4, 2010                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       Displaying Downgraded Messages        December 2009


   current message.  If the corresponding field can not be found, the
   downgraded header field in question can not be regenerated and used.

3.2.  The process

   A MUA MAY decode and re-generate the original header fields of the
   message (MTAs and MDAs SHOULD NOT attempt to do this; it SHOULD be
   left to the MUA).  This procedure can be used to approximately
   reverse the Downgrade process, but it will not always construct the
   original header fields exactly.

   Three types of Downgraded header fields are described in section 3 of
   [RFC5504]:
   1.  "Envelope Information Preservation Header Fields", described in
       RFC5504 section 3.1 and in Section 3.2.1, below.
   2.  "Address Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields", described in
       RFC5504 section 3.2 and in Section 3.2.2, below.
   3.  "Unknown Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields", described in
       RFC5504 section 3.3 and in Section 3.2.3, below.

   After processing Downgraded header fields, decode all header fields,
   as described in [RFC2047] and [RFC2231].

3.2.1.  No reconstruction of the Envelope Information Preservation
        Header Fields

   Envelope Information Preservation Header Fields are new fields that
   might have been added by the downgrade process.  Because they do not
   represent fields that appeared in the original message, this process
   is not applicable to them.

3.2.2.  Reconstructing the Address Header Fields' Preservation Header
        Fields

   Reconstructing Address Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields is
   OPTIONAL, and a decision MAY be made on each field, individually.  In
   particular, it might be less important to process the Resent-* header
   fields, so an implementation MAY choose to skip those.

   To construct a displayable copy of a header field from one of these
   downgraded header fields, follow this procedure:
   1.   In an edit buffer, create a new header field:"
   1a.   For the field name, remove the "Downgraded-" prefix from the
      downgraded field name.  For example, "Downgraded-From" becomes
      "From", and "Downgraded-Resent-To" becomes "Resent-To".

Internet-Draft       Displaying Downgraded Messages        December 2009


   1b.   For the field value, decode the MIME-encoded value of the
      downgraded field according to [RFC2047].
   2.   If the header field is one that can only appear once, according
      to the table in [RFC5322] section 3.6 ("From", "Sender", "To",
      "CC", "BCC", "Reply-To"), locate the corresponding field in the
      message's headers, and skip to step 9.  Otherwise, continue with
      step 3.
   3.   Apply "Email Header Fields Downgrading", defined in section 5 of
      [RFC5504], to the field in the edit buffer, but do not prepend the
      "Downgraded-" prefix.  Put the result into comparison buffer 1.
   4.   Canonicalize the header fields in the comparison buffer:
      1.  Unfold all header field continuation lines as described in
          [RFC5322].
      2.  Ensure that there is one space character before and one after
          the <mailbox-list> separator ",".  If a space character is
          missing, insert one.
      3.  Ensure that there is one space character before and one after
          each <comment>.  If a space character is missing, insert one.
      4.  Decode each <encoded-word> whose charset is "UTF-8".
      5.  Convert all sequences of one or more WSP characters to a
          single space character.  WSP characters here include those
          before and after a line-folding boundary.
      6.  Delete all WSP characters at the end of each unfolded header
          field value.
      7.  Delete any WSP characters remaining before and after the colon
          separating the header field name from the header field value,
          retaining the colon separator.
   5.   Locate the first instance of the corresponding field in the
      message's headers.
   6.   Canonicalize the located field as in step 4, and put the result
      into comparison buffer 2.
   7.   Compare the header field in comparison buffer 1 with the header
      field in comparison buffer 2.  If they match, go to step 9.
   8.   Locate the next instance of the corresponding field in the
      message's headers.  If one is found, go to step 6.  If none is
      found, stop: you can not use this downgraded field because you
      can't find its replacement in the message.
   9.   Replace the located header field with the one in the edit
      buffer.  You MUST NOT reorder the header fields when you do this;
      it's important to replace the field in place.

3.2.3.  The Unknown Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields

   The Unknown Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields SHOULD be left
   as they are unless the MUA has special knowledge of a particular
   field.  An MUA with such knowledge MAY use the procedure in
   Section 3.2.2, above, for those fields that it knows about.

4.  Security considerations

   While information in any email header should usually be treated with
   some suspicion, current email systems commonly employ various
   mechanisms and protocols to make the information more trustworthy.
   For example, an organization's boundary MTA can modify "From:" lines
   so that messages arriving from outside the organization are easily
   distinguishable from internal emails.  As a result of that rewriting,
   it might not be possible to reconstruct the "Downgraded-From" header
   field.

   A MUA MAY emphasize bogus or broken Address Header Fields'
   Preservation Header Fields found in step 8 of Section 3.2.2.

   Hiding the information from the actual header fields when using the
   "Downgraded-" header fields does not cause loss of information if
   generating MIME decoded header fields in step 1 of Section 3.2.2 and
   the comparison done in step 8 are successful.  To ensure that no
   information is lost, a MUA SHOULD have a function that uses the
   actual message that was received (with/without MIME decoding) to
   render the message.

   See "Security considerations" section in [RFC5504] and [RFC4952] for
   more discussion.

A.1.  Displaying example

   This example shows how to display the message in Figure 2, above,
   using the process defined in Section 3.  For simplicity, we will show
   the reconstruction of all the applicable fields at once.

   Selecting all Downgraded-* fields gives this:



Downgraded-Mail-From: =?UTF-8?Q?<NON-ASCII-local@example.com_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<ASCII-local@example.com>>?=
Downgraded-Rcpt-To: =?UTF-8?Q?<NON-ASCII-remote1@example.net_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<ASCII-remote1@example.net>>?=
Downgraded-Unknown-Field: =?UTF-8?Q?NON-ASCII-Unknown?=
Downgraded-From: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-local_<NON-ASCII-local@example.com_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<ASCII-local@example.com>>?=
Downgraded-To: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-remote1_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<NON-ASCII-remote1@example.net_<ASCII-remote1@example.net>>?=
Downgraded-Cc: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-remote2_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<NON-ASCII-remote2@example.org>?=
Downgraded-Resent-From: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-remote1_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<NON-ASCII-remote1@example.net_<ASCII-remote1@example.net>>?=
Downgraded-Resent-To: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-reto_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<NON-ASCII-reto@example.net_<ASCII-reto@example.net>>?=


                    Figure 4: Downgraded header fields

   Two of the fields, Downgraded-Mail-From and Downgraded-Rcpt-To, are
   Envelope Information Preservation Header Fields, and will not be
   reconstructed.  One field, Downgraded-Unknown-Field, is an Unknown
   Header Fields' Preservation Header Field, and will also not be
   reconstructed.  That leaves these to be reconstructed, the Address
   Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields:



Downgraded-From: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-local_<NON-ASCII-local@example.com_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<ASCII-local@example.com>>?=
Downgraded-To: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-remote1_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<NON-ASCII-remote1@example.net_<ASCII-remote1@example.net>>?=
Downgraded-Cc: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-remote2_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<NON-ASCII-remote2@example.org>?=
Downgraded-Resent-From: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-remote1_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<NON-ASCII-remote1@example.net_<ASCII-remote1@example.net>>?=
Downgraded-Resent-To: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-reto_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<NON-ASCII-reto@example.net_<ASCII-reto@example.net>>?=

              Figure 5: Header fields for the reconstruction

   Now, perform Step 1, creating temporary fields.



   From: DISPLAY-local <NON-ASCII-local@example.com
    <ASCII-local@example.com>>
   To: DISPLAY-remote1 <NON-ASCII-remote1@example.net
    <ASCII-remote1@example.net>>
   Cc: DISPLAY-remote2 <NON-ASCII-remote2@example.org>
   Resent-From: DISPLAY-remote1
    <NON-ASCII-remote1@example.net <ASCII-remote1@example.net>>
   Resent-To: DISPLAY-reto
    <NON-ASCII-reto@example.net <ASCII-reto@example.net>>


                        Figure 6: Output of Step 1

   In step 2, we set aside the "From", "To", and "Cc" fields, and
   continue to step 3 with just "Resent-From" and "Resent-To" (the
   fields that may appear more than once).  The fields we set aside will
   be picked up again later, in step 9.

   Perform Steps 3 and 4.  The edit buffer contains re-generated ASCII
   header fields, canonicalized.



   Resent-From: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-remote1?= <ASCII-remote1@example.net>
   Resent-To: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-reto?= <ASCII-reto@example.net>


               Figure 7: The edit buffer (output of Step 4)

   Perform Steps 5 to 7, comparison, for each header field.  Both the
   Resent-From and Resent-To fields will match, and we will proceed to
   step 9.  (Step 8, iteration, does not apply in this example.

   Perform step 9, replacing all applicable fields, without changing the
   order.  Then do MIME decoding on everything, for display.

                        Figure 8: The final result

   As a result, in this simple example, some original header fields are
   now displayed in their original form.  Differences between Figure 1
   and Figure 8 are Return-Path, Downgraded-Mail-From,
   Downgraded-Rcpt-To, and Downgraded-Unknown-Field.
