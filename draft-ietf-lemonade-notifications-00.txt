1.    Introduction 
    
   As the work on LEMONADE Profile ([LEMONADEPROFILE] and 
   [LEMONADEPROFILEPHASE2]) progresses, a need has been identified to 
   provide notification and filtering mechanisms to IMAP4. 
    
   The requirements for inband and outband server to client 
   notifications are documented in [OMA-ME-RD].  
    
2.   Objectives 
    
   According to these analyses, there is a need to support: 
   - Mechanisms for event-based (server to client) synchronization: 
      - Defines the relationship between notification mechanisms and the 
     IMAP4 protocol  
         - To minimize the latency observed for email events on the 
         email server to be reflected in the email client. 
         - To avoid unnecessary polling and requests from the e-mail 
         clients: 
            - To reduce the total amount of data to be exchanged between 
            email server and client, e.g. by allowing the email client 
            to select which messages to synchronize and how to 
            synchronize. 
            - To reduce the amount of transactions. 
      - Needs to cope with possible lost or delayed notifications 
      - Support in-band (within IMAP band) and out-band notifications 
     (Exchanged via other servers / enablers). 
         - Specified in ways that are network transport independent but 
         may contain some bindings to particular notification channels 
         (e.g. SMS binary, WAP Push, SIP Notification, ...) 
         - When the email client is connected to the email server, only 
         inband notifications is expected take place 
      - Defines notification payload for inband and outband mechanisms. 
   - Server-side filtering to decide which messages will be accessible 
   by the email client. 
     - Filtering results into the following logical types: 
         - Type A: Messages filtered out and not accessible by the email 
         client (no notification, no header access, no access) 
         - Type B: Messages that are accessible by the mobile e-mail 
         enabler client but no outband notification takes place. Inband 
         notification might however take place if email client is 
         already connected to email server. 
         - Type C: Messages that are accessible by the e-mail client for 
         which notifications (outband or inband) are always sent to the 
         email client.

   - Notions of Filters:  
     - View filters: Filters that determine which email messages are of 
     type B and C or A 
     - Notification filters: Filters that determine which email messages 
     are of type C or B 
     - Event filters: Filters that determines what events are to be 
     notified to the client 
   - Mechanisms to allow the user to update the filters from the email 
   client 
   - Mechanisms to allow configuration and exchange of settings between 
   the client and the server in band or outband: 
     - Server to client: e.g. server ID, account name, policies, … 
     - Client to server: e.g. rules filters vacation notices, 
     notification channel, ... 
    
   The present document describes how this may be achieved within the 
   scope of LEMONADE Profile [LEMONADEPROFILEPHASE2]. 
    
3.   Notification logical architecture and LEMONADE Profile phase 2 
    
   The target logical architectures involving the LEMONADE Profile and 
   notifications are discussed in [LEMONADEPROFILEPHASE2].  
    
   Figure 1 illustrates how notification and filtering can be introduced 
   in the context of LEMONADE profile phase 2.

   Figure 1: Filtering mechanism defined in LEMONADE Profile phase 2 
   architecture. 
    
   In Figure 1, four categories of filters are defined: 
    
      - AF: Administrative Filters - Set up by email service provider.  
   AF are typically not configured by the user and set to apply policies 
   content filtering, virus protection, spam filtering etc... 
      - DF: Deposit Filters - Filters that are executed on deposit of 
   new emails.  They can be defined as SIEVE filters [SIEVE].  They can 
   include vacation notices. 
      - VF: View Filters - Filters that define which emails are visible 
   to the MUA.  View filters can be defined as virtual folders [VFOLDER] 
   as described in later in this document. 
      - NF: Notification Filters - Filters that define for what email 
   server event an outband notification is sent to the client. 
 
   The filters are manageable from the MUA: 
      - NF and DF: via SIEVE management protocol <Editor's note: Still 
   to be defined>. [IMAPSIEVE] provides an example of how notification 
   filters (NF) may be expressed in SIEVE. 
      - VF: via VFOLDER as defined in [VFOLDER] 
 
4.   Capability Descriptions 
    
   CAPABILITY can be used to support determination of support of server 
   to client notification. 
    
   The CAPABILITY command is defined in RFC3501, section 6.1.1.  The 
   client sends a CAPABILITY command so it can query the server to find 
   out what commands it supports.  In RFC3501, the IMAP server is 
   allowed to specify additional capabilities not included in that 
   specification.  A server MUST list what commands it supports.    
    
   A server can also enumerate individually the other commands that it 
   supports.  
    
   capability_cmd =  tag SP "CAPABILITY"  
   Valid States:  NOT AUTHENTICATED, AUTHENTICATED, SELECTED, or LOGOUT 
   Responses:  REQUIRED untagged response: CAPABILITY 
   Result:  OK - capability completed 
      BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid 
    
   Example: A server that implements Server to Client Notification and 
   Filtering.

   LPROVISION, LSETPREF and LGETPREF refer to the mechanisms defined in 
   later sections. 
    
   LPSEARCH declares support for [VFOLDER]. 
    
   LNOTIFICATION declares support for outband notification filters and 
   filter management as described in this document. 
    
5.   Event-based synchronization 
 
   The addition of Server-to-client notifications transforms the 
   LEMONADE profile into an event-based synchronization protocol. 
   Whenever an event of the type [MSGEVENTS] occurs with the view, a 
   notification can be generated. [MSGEVENTS] provides a list of 
   possible events that could be notified (based on the filter 
   settings). 
    
   If the MUA is connected to the IMAP server, inband notifications are 
   generated following IDLE [RFC2177]. 
    
   When the MUA is not connected, the Notification filter generates a 
   notification. The notification filter may be considered as acting on 
   a PUSH repository. 
    
   All three repositories have the same set of folders. Formally, a 
   repository consists of a set of folders, and each folder has both a 
   name and a set of messages associated with it. The “complete 
   repository” consists of all folders of an end user and all the 
   associated messages for each of those folders. 
    
   Note UIDs are assume the same in these repositories for a same 
   message. 
    
   This is illustrated in Figure 2.

               Figure 2:  Filters and Repositories 
    
   In inband notification mode, IDLE is exchanged between the MUA and 
   the LEMONADE IMAP server. 
    
   In outband notification mode, the outband notification may be a 
   message (notification payload) and possibly a set of surrounding 
   exchanges sent with an appropriate format to a particular IP address 
   and port. This may be the address of the MUA. However, in general, it 
   conforms to the interface of a notification server / mechanisms 
   responsible for finalizing the format and sending the notification to 
   the MUA on the client with the appropriate protocol. 
    
   The following sections provide description of the outband 
   notification payload format and mechanisms to check, set and 
   notification settings. 
     
6.   Filters 
    
   [SIEVE] provides an email filtering language.  
    
   [VFOLDER] describes how the View Filter (VF) can be implemented and 
   modified from the MUA. 
    
   [SIEVENOTIFICATION] and [IMAPSIEVE] provides a mechanisms to 
   associate notifications based on the [SIEVE] filter whenever messages 
   are created or changed within a LEMONADE IMAP store.  
    
   6.1.         Next steps and future work 
    
   [SIEVE] filters and [IMAPSIEVE] should be extended to support binding 
   to all [MSGEVENTS].  
 
7.   Inband notification payload 
 
   Inband notification syntax follows the IDLE specifications [RFC2177]. 
    
   Any inband notification must be considered by the MUA as a wake up 
   call for the MUA to get back to the server. 
    
8.   Outband Notification payload

                < Lemonade Notifications and Filters>    January 2006 
 
 
   8.1.          Outband Notification Payload in Clear Text  
    
   The outband notification payload is in general in clear text. Server 
   to Client Notification and Filtering treats the notification as a 
   signal to the client to fetch the information on the server that 
   awaits it.  
    
   The suggested payload for notifications is that suggested by the OMA, 
   see [OMA-EN]. This notification basically informs the client that 
   some push event has happened on the server, so it must connect to 
   fetch the information. 
    
   Server to client notifications and filters treats the notificatoon as 
   a MUA wake up event to fetch the information on the server that 
   awaits it. The MUA MAY present other behaviors that exploit 
   additional information provided in the notification. However this is 
   out of scope of the specifications. 
    
   Wake-up events consists of the following payload: <emn 
   mailbox="mailat:john.doe@somewhere.com" 
   timestamp="date_format_as_specified_in_[OMA-EMN]"></emn> 
    
   The notification payload is generated by NF and sent to an 
   appropriate messaging interface, appropriately formatted for that 
   interface. The messaging mechanism is then responsible for sending 
   the notification to the MUA. 
    
   When the client finally connects, the server has opportunity to send 
   other pending events for this client.  
          
     Example: A new message arrives on the server and this is notified 
   via out-of-band. 
      S: pushes SMS with the following text: 
         <emn  
           mailbox="mailat:joe@foo.com"  
           timestamp="2004-02-20T06:40:00Z"> 
         </emn> 
    
   The notification payload is sent to an SMSC messaging interface, 
   appropriately formatted for that interface. The SMSC is responsible 
   for sending the SMS to the MUA. 
    
      C: needs to connect and send any command to get the pending events    
      and act upon them. 
      C: A00 Login joe password <Editor’s note: to be updated based on 
   Quick reconnect [CONNECT]> 
      S: * SESSION SELECTED <Editor’s note: to be updated based on Quick 
   reconnect [CONNECT]> 
      S: * FOLDER INBOX

      C: must now act on the events on the order they are received, 
   meaning, first perform a FETCH to get new message, then expunge 
   message 87 and change flags of message 90. 
 
   If EXTENDED notification format is supported by the MUA, the 
   following notification may be send instead of the wake-up event as: 
   The notification message is of the form: 
    
   <tag> <notification seq no> <client-email-account -name>  <event> 
   [<uid>, <sender>, <date>, <time>, <subject>, [<body.]] 
    
   where <tag> is <tag> is “_%$L$%_”, 
   and <event> is one of 
   NEW_MESSAGE 
   DELETED_MESSAGE 
   CHANGED_MESSAGE 
   SYNC 
   FULL_SYNC 
   STATE_COMPARISON_SYNC 
   NEW_ENC_KEY 
   LOCK_DOWN 
    
   Except for the <tag>, the notification message is encrypted using the 
   encryption key. 
    
   The different tags are: 
   NEW_MESSAGE: a new message has arrived on the server

   fetched using UID FETCH command with the range (lastUID + 1):*. Where 
   lastUID is that lastUID received so far. This typically happens when 
   the server determines that the session is valid and the UID VALIDITY 
   (See [IMAP-DISC]) is the same in client and server. 
    
   In the case of FULL_SYNC requests (full synchronization), the client 
   sends its messages that are to be sent, discards delete or change 
   status operations to do on the server, discard its local emails (e.g. 
   in INBOX) and populating the Inbox with messages using the FETCH 1:* 
   command. It also rebuilds the UID-Sequence map.  
    
   8.2.         Encrypted outband notifications 
    
   When using NEW_ENC_KEY, the notification are encrypted with ENC KEY. 
   In the case of new encryption (NEW_ENC_KEY) and to cater for the 
   unreliable nature of the notification channel, messages encrypted 
   using old encryption key from a device MUST be accepted be the server 
   until the server receives a message encrypted using the new key. From 
   that point onward it MUST only accept the messages encrypted using 
   the new key. 
 
   8.3.         Out-of-band SMS channel binding (INFORMATIVE Sub-section) 
     
   One method for delivering wake-up notifications is by pushing the 
   notification payload as a binary SMS message.  Upon receiving an SMS, 
   a client would then parse the payload, determine if it is a email 
   notification or some other SMS message, and process the message 
   appropriately.  
    
   This has the unfortunate side effect of forcing the client to parse 
   every message trying to sense what kind of message it is. The 
   proposed mechanism to fix this is to utilize the binary  
    
   SMS User Data Header (UDH) to specify a destination port, according 
   to the Application Port  
    
   Addressing Scheme in [GSM03.40] or alternatively, on CDMA networks, 
   to use the WAP WDP mapping to GSM SMS [WAPWDP]. 
    
   Although any port number is usable, it might make sense to use port 
   143 for consistency, which is the IANA IMAP port. Thus, OMA EMN or 
   extended format notifications should be sent to port 143 via GSM SMS 
   or WAP WDP. The client upon receiving the SMS will check the port 
   number, and if the port is the right port, the message will be routed 
   to the appropriate client application for processing. 
    
   Because such mechanisms are network specific, a server should 
   determine if a port specific SMS or WAP WDP mapping can be used based 
   on knowledge of the device / network or on strategies that determine

   if the device reacts to such notifications. However, a client may 
   also declare it / selecting the out-of-band notification channel as 
   GSMSMS or WAPWDP as for any other notification channel. 
    
9.   LEMONADE message store behavior 
    
   Because outband notifications may be sent over unreliable channels 
   (i.e. they may be lost or delayed), the server MUST keep track of the 
   outband notifications that are sent via NF, until the MUA react to 
   them.  
    
   When the MUA request changes from the server, it MUST provide all the 
   changes since the last time the client connected and requested 
   changes (i.e. all the notifications that have not been acted upon and 
   all the changes since the last notification). This ensure robustness 
   to notification issues. 
    
   If a MUA does not react to outband notifications, the server MAY stop 
   sending outband notifications, expect possible periodic wake up call 
   till the client reconnects. 
    
10.    Checking notification settings 
    
   Mailbox annotations provide additional mechanism for the client to 
   determine server settings.  
    
   The LGETPREFS provides also an inband mechanisms  to determine these. 
    
11.    Changing notification settings 
    
   LETSETPREFS provides an inband mechanism to set / change notification 
   and server settings. 
    
12.    LPROVISION 
 
   The LPROVISION command is used to allow a device to obtain service 
   specific parameters of the server.  This includes what filters have 
   been defined.  Also, it will supply a list of all preferences and the 
   values they can be set to. In addition, UDP information may be given 
   when UDP notification is supported, such as the host name and port.  
   A server can return other parameters as long as its syntax is agreed 
   upon with the client.

12.1.1. LSETPREF & LGETPREFS 
    
   The LSETPREF command allows a user to define certain configuration 
   parameters, while the LGETPREFS command allows a user to retrieve the 
   configuration values.  Any server that implements these commands must 
   respond with LPREF as one of the capabilities in response to a 
   CAPABILITY command.  It must also announce the values these 
   parameters can be set to in the LPROVISION command as specified as

   follows.  These parameters affect how out-of-band notifications are 
   sent to the client, as well as the format for sending new event 
   notifications.  If the server supports LPREF they are required to 
   support all of the following preferences.   
    
   This command also allows the user to set active filters.  By default, 
   view filters are set to ALL, while notification filters are set to 
   NOT ALL.  This means that the mobile repository includes all the 
   messages in the complete repository, but none are pushed to the 
   client, which is the IMAPv4 Rev1 model.  To set a filter, first the 
   folder that the filter in question should be applied to, or "ALL" for 
   all folders should be specified.  Next the user specifies "V", "N", 
   or "B" to set either a view filter or a notification filter, or both.  
   Following this, it must specify the name of the filter for that 
   folder.  This filter may have been created by the LFILTER command, or 
   be a system defined filter.  Exactly one view filter and one 
   notification filter is associated with each folder for each device.  
   When a new view filter or notification filter is created, it replaces 
   the previous filter for that folder.  When a view filter is modified, 
   the client needs to perform a state-comparison-based sync on the 
   client in order for the device to be in sync with the mobile 
   repository.  The server always sends only notifications that 
   correspond to the most up-to-date view filters and notification 
   filters.  All filters persist across sessions; once set, a filter on 
   a folder applies until the user changes it. 
     
   The preferences that can set with this command are as follows and 
   their names start with L to identify them as the parameters 
   introduced in this draft. (They may not apply in some configuration 
   (e.g. no L OUTBAND ADDRESS when using UDP notifications)): 
      
     [1] L_OUTBAND_ADDRESS - the number or email address to send out-of-
     band notification messages to the client.  This must be a valid 
     address according to the out-of-band channel requirements.  This 
     will not be returned in the LPROVISION command. This is not 
     applicable to out-of-band UDP notifications. 
      
     [2] L_OUTBAND_CHANNEL - the channel to send out-of-band 
     notifications, either SMS, GSMSMS, JMS, WAP_PUSH, WAPWDP, MMS, SIP, 
     UDP or NONE.  When NONE, the server does not send the client any 
     out-of-band notifications.  The list of values may be extended with 
     new values when different out-of-band channels are available. The 
     valid values for this preference that the server supports will be 
     given in response to the LPROVISION command.  
      
     [3] L_INBAND_NEW_FORMAT - the FETCH parameters to automatically 
     send to the client when there is a new message and there is a valid 
     session, or NONE.  If NONE, the server sends the client a 
     traditional EXISTS message when a new message arrives in the

     folder.  Otherwise, in place of the EXISTS message, the server 
     sends an untagged FETCH response with the given information.  The 
     valid values for this preference that the server supports will be 
     given in response to the LPROVISION command. 
      
     [4] L_INBAND_PUSH - whether or not the server should automatically 
     IDLE the server when a folder is selected.  The valid values for 
     this preference that the server supports will be given in response 
     to the XPROVISION command. 
      
     [5] L_OUTBAND_FORMAT - the format to send the out-of-band 
     notifications, i.e. EMN or EXTENDED.   
      
     [6] L_EVENT_FILTER - The event filter for this user.  Possible 
     values are ALL or NONE or NEW, depending on the server's 
     capabilities. 
      
     [7] L_FILTER - Sets a named filter as the active filter for a given 
     folder.  The value of this parameter includes the folder, filter 
     type (possibly VIEW, NOTIF, or BOTH depending on server 
     capabilities), and the name of the FILTER.

   LSETPREF provides a way to update the filters from the client by 
   pointing to particular filter profiles 
    
   VFOLDER also provides ways to update VF. 
    
   <Editor’s note: A more detailed protocol to manage the NF filters 
   should be added.> 
    
14.    Out of scope items for IETF 
 
    
   OMA provides ways to perform provisioning via OMA client provisioning 
   and device management. Other provisioning specifications are 
   available (e.g. SMS based). 
    
   OMA provides enablers to support outband notifications: the outband 
   notification mechanisms. 
    
   Also, OMA XDM may be considered also for outband filter changes. 
 
Security Considerations 
    
   Notifications must be secured (when useful information is send) and 
   integrity should be checkable. 
    
   It should be possible to prevent authenticate sender and prevent 
   Denial of Service attack via notifications.
