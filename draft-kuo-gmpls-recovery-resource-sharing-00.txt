Abstract
   Many protection and restoration (P&R) techniques are proposed to 
   protect LSP in GMPLS networks. Provisioning better P&R capability 
   requires that more recovery resources be allocated on protection
   LSP, which may lead to resource waste in GMPLS networks.
   
   This draft presents a scheme of recovery resource sharing with   
   traffic balancing for GMPLS LSP P&R. Its focus is on the 
   discussions of working and protection LSPs selection and shared 
   resource allocation and release.

1. Introduction

   As the real-time and multimedia-oriented services are rapidly  
   increasing on Internet, a small link or node failure is not 
   acceptable to customers. Service continuity is becoming much more 
   important than before. Protection and Restoration (P&R) (see [TERM])
   is an efficient way to improve service continuity by establishing 
   protection path for working path. Obviously, recovery resources 
   reserved on protection path are idle at most time, which is 
   unreasonable from the viewpoint of resource utilization. 
   
   An efficient way to improve recovery resource utilization is to have
   protection LSPs, whose working LSPs are physically disjoint, share
   bandwidth resources. This mechanism was coined as shared mesh 
   restoration and described in [GMPLS-ANAL]. Clearly, not all GMPLS 
   recovery mechanisms can provide recovery resource sharing. For   
   example, in the 1+1 protection mechanism, the traffic is transmitted 
   simultaneously on both the working and protection LSPs. The selector
   at the egress will decide which path to use according to the quality
   of signal. Obviously, no recovery resources can be shared in 1+1 
   protection, while other recovery mechanisms such as M:N recovery do 
   provision resource sharing.

   To share the recovery resources can save bandwidth in networks, 
   thus, rejected session setup requests can be decreased in a certain 
   degree. Moreover, maximum recovery resource sharing with traffic 
   balancing can further decrease rejected session setup requests in 
   GMPLS networks. We will discuss the scheme to optimize recovery 
   resource sharing with traffic balancing and the implementation of  
   the scheme.
	
   Section 2 introduces the notions used in the draft. Section 3
   describes the scheme to optimize recovery resource sharing with 
   traffic balancing. Section 4 provides the signaling implementation 
   of the scheme. Section 5 discusses resource allocation and release. 
   Section 6 evaluates the performance of proposed scheme. Section 7 
   presents the application of the scheme in LSP segment protection 
   and restoration. And, Section 8 concludes this draft.
    
2. Notions   
   
   We model the network as G=(V, E), where V is the set of nodes and E
   is the set of all links in networks. A LSP is defined as 
   LSP={s, r1, ..., rn, d}, where s and d denote source and destination 
   nodes respectively, and rk denotes the k-th intermediate LSR along 
   the LSP. In addition, to identify a LSP in GMPLS networks, either a 
   global identifier (ID) or a triple <s, d, local_ID> must be used.  
   To simplify the presentation, the global identifier (ID) is used in 
   this draft. Furthermore, the following notations are defined: 
    
   l(i, j): The link from nodes i to j.
   
   Cij:     The cost of l(i, j).
   
   b:       The bandwidth demand of a LSP setup request.
   
   Bij:     Total amount of bandwidth reserved for protection LSPs on
            l(i, j).
  
   Rij:     Total amount of residual bandwidth on l(i, j).
   
   RLij:    Set of protection LSPs that traverse l(i, j). 
            RLij={RLij[1], RLij[2], ..., RLij[K]}, where RLij[k] is  
            the ID of the k-th protection LSP and K is the total number  
            of protection LSPs on l(i, j).
   
   PLij:    Set of LSPs which are protected by l(i, j). 
   	    PLij={PLij[1], PLij[2], ..., PLij[K]}, where PLij[k] is 
   	    the ID of the k-th LSP protected by RLij[k].
   
   fij[k]:  The recovery bandwidth required to be allocated to RLij[k].
   	    fij[k] is always equal to the bandwidth demand of PLij[k].

   tij[k][m]: The bandwidth that RLij[k] shares with RLij[m], 
   	      where k<>m. So, the actual recovery bandwidth allocated 
   	      to RLij[k] is fij[k] - sum {m=1}^K [tij[k][m]].
   
   WLij:      Set of working LSPs that traverse l(i, j).
   
   Inf(Wlsp): Information about WLij of all links along Wlsp, where 
   	      Wlsp={s, w1, ..., wn, d} is the selected working LSP.
   	      That is Inf(Wlsp)=WLsw1 OR WLw1w2 OR ... OR WLwnd.
   
   Weight[i,j]: Weight of l(i, j) used in computing a route.
   
   In this draft, we assume node i is the dominating node of l(i, j), 
   that is, the information about WLij, RLij, PLij, fij[k] and 
   tij[k][m] are held in node i locally. Thus, WLij, RLij, PLij, fij[k]
   and tij[k][m] can be refreshed on node i when any working or 
   protection LSP traversing l(i, j) is set up. 
   
3. Recovery resource sharing with traffic balancing  
   
    In the proposed scheme, only information of Bij and Rij is required    
    for computing a route, that is, only Bij and Rij are flooded in  
    networks. The flooding of Bij and Rij can be easily implemented by  
    route protocol extensions OSPF [GMPLS-OSPF] / IS-IS [OSPF-ISIS] in  
    GMPLS. The current solutions for recovery resource sharing are the
    two approaches mentioned in [GMPLS-ANAL]: Full Information and 
    Partial Information approaches. We coin the scheme as Proper 
    Information approach.
    
    When computing the route of working LSP, the Proper Information 
    approach computes the weight of l(i, j) as follows,
    
                        _ _  Cij / Rij    (Rij >= b)
                       |                                   
           Weight[i,j]=|_ _  infinity     (otherwise)
    
    After the working LSP is selected, when protection LSP is being  
    selected, Weight[i,j] should be computed as follows,
  
                        ---- Cij                   (Bij >= b) 
                       |
           Weight[i,j]=|---- Cij+Cij*(1-Bij/b)     (Bij<b, Rij>=b-Bij)  
           	       |
                        ---- infinity              (otherwise)

    The weight computation of l(i, j) above has two advantages: 
    a) It can provision more probability of recovery resource sharing 
    in GMPLS networks. b) It can balance the traffic in GMPLS networks.
    When computing working LSP, it is obvious that the Weight(i, j) 
    will be less if l(i, j) has more residual bandwidth. When 
    protection LSP is selected, Weight(i, j) will be less if l(i, j)  
    has reserved more bandwidth. Thus, links with more reserved  
    bandwidth will be more possible to be selected as the parts of  
    protection LSP.  
    
    Suppose Plsp is selected as protection LSP. Let Bw(i,j) represents
    the recovery resources that should be allocated for Plsp on l(i, j).
    The computation of Bw(i, j) is conducted on node i as follows.
         
         TmpSet = Inf(Wlsp) AND PLij;
         PLij[n] is an element in TmpSet;
         w = Bij - sum{n} [fij[n]];
         
                  ---- 0                     (b <= w)
                 |                     
         Bw(i,j)=|---- b - w                 (Rij >= b-w, b>w)  
                 |
                  ---- infinity              (otherwise) 
    
    Note that Bw(i,j) may be set to infinity as above, which means 
    recovery resource reserving action may fail on l(i, j). The reason 
    of this is the bandwidth estimation in computing protection LSP 
    is inaccurate. Two conditions in computing Weight[i,j] for 
    protection LSP may cause the failure of Plsp setup:
   
    a)Even if Bij>=b is satisfied, only x bandwidth units can be shared
      due to the restriction that the protected LSPs must be physically 
      disjoint, where x<b. However, Rij<b-x, which means no enough 
      residual resources can be allocated for recovery purpose. So, 
      recovery resource allocation will fail on l(i, j).
      
    b)When Bij<b and Rij>=b-Bij is satisfied, b-Bij bandwidth units 
      need to be allocated at least as recovery resources. But, only x 
      bandwidth units can be shared due to the restriction that the 
      protected LSPs must be physically disjoint, where x<Bij. Thus, 
      more bandwidth than b-Bij should be allocated as recovery 
      resources now. As a result, no enough residual resources can be 
      allocated if Rij<b-x.
      
    However, the probability of conditions a) and b) occurrence is 
    small in practical networks, thus, it has little affect on the 
    performance of rejected LSP setup requests in the scheme. In fact,
    the Proper Information approach performs very well in decreasing 
    rejected LSP setup requests in Section 6.
    
4. Signaling implementation

   No additional signaling procedure is required in the Proper 
   Information approach though all nodes along the selected protection  
   LSP must be informed inf(Wlsp). As mentioned in Section II, node i   
   is assumed to be the dominating node for any l(i, j), and the 
   information about WLij, RLij, PLij, fij[k] and tij[k][m] will 
   be obtained on node i.
   
   Both the signaling protocol RSVP Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) 
   extensions [RFC-3473] and constraint-based routing label distributi-
   on protocol (CR-LDP) [RFC-3472] are supported in GMPLS. In this 
   draft, we describe the signaling procedure for Proper Information 
   approach by RSVP-TE since it is more widely used.  However, similar 
   procedure can be applied to CR-LDP. 
   
   We assume the information of Bij and Rij have been advertised to all
   nodes in networks by route protocol extension. When receiving the 
   LSP setup request, the source node uses Dijkstra's algorithm to 
   select the working LSP with Weight[i,j] computed as above. When the 
   working LSP Wlsp is selected, a PATH message is sent from source to 
   destination nodes along Wlsp to setup the LSP. After receiving the 
   PATH message, the destination node sends a RESV message back to the 
   source node. The information of Inf(Wlsp) should be transmitted to 
   the source node with the RESV message. All intermediate nodes along 
   Wlsp will allocate the resources for Wlsp and update the information
   of Inf(Wlsp) when receiving the RESV message. When RESV message 
   reaches the source, the establishment of Wlsp is finished.  Now, the
   source node obtains the information of Inf(Wlsp). 
   
   Then, protection LSP Plsp is selected by source node in terms of 
   Weight[i,j] computed in Section 3. Similar to the setup of Wlsp, 
   a PATH message is sent from source to destination nodes along Plsp. 
   Here, the information of Inf(Wlsp) and the ID of established 
   working LSP can be transmitted to all intermediate nodes along Plsp 
   with PATH message. Any node receiving the RESV message will use the 
   information of Inf(Wlsp) to compute Bw(i,j). 
   
   If the computation result of Bw(i,j) is infinity, the node will ter-
   minate the propagation of PATH message and send a PATHERR message 
   back to the source node to notify the failure of Plsp establishment.
   Otherwise, the PATH message will be forwarded to the next node till 
   it reaches the destination node. Then, the destination sends a RESV 
   message back to the source node along Plsp.  Upon receiving the 
   RESV message, the intermediate nodes will allocate resources 
   according to previous computed Bw(i,j). The establishment is compl-
   eted when source node receives the RESV message.
   
   As shown above, no additional signaling procedure is required for 
   working and protection LSPs setup in the Proper Information 
   approach. But additional information (e.g., information of 
   Inf(Wlsp)) must be transmitted during the signaling procedure.

   The signaling procedure of LSP release will not be discussed in this 
   section due to two facts: 1) The signaling procedure for LSP release
   in the Proper Information approach is the same as that in standard 
   GMPLS. 2) No additional information will be transmitted when 
   releasing working and protection LSPs in the Proper Information 
   approach.
   
5. Resource allocation and release
   
   In this section, we introduce how to allocate and release resources 
   correctly and simply in the proposed scheme. Release of resources 
   closely relates to the procedure of resource allocation. RSVP-TE 
   is still used as signaling protocol in this section.
   
5.1 Resource allocation

   The resource allocation consists of two procedures: resource alloc-
   ation for working LSP and resource allocation for protection LSP. 
   The resource allocation procedures are as follows:   
   
   Proc.1) A new working LSP Wlsp is being established. LSP ID of Wlsp
           is X and bandwidth demand is b units. For any link l(i, j) 
           along Wlsp, when node i receives RESV message:
        a) Rij = Rij - b;
        b) WLij = WLij OR {X};
   
   Proc.2) A new protection LSP Plsp is being established. LSP ID of 
   	   Plsp is Y and bandwidth demand is b units. The ID of working
   	   LSP that Plsp protects is X. Let the bandwidth that Plsp can 
   	   share with others on l(i, j) be a. For any link l(i, j) 
   	   along Plsp, when node i receives RESV message:
	a) Rij = Rij - Bw(i,j);
	b) Bij = Bij + Bw(i,j);
	c) RLij = RLij OR {Y};  (Suppose RLij [k] = Y;)
	d) PLij = PLij OR {X};  (i.e., PLij[k] = X;)
	e) fij[k] = b;
	f) For all m
  	     tij[k][m] = 0;
	g) tmpS=Inf(Wlsp) AND PLij;
	   S = set of RLij[m]; (where PLij[m] is not in tmpS, m<>k)
	h) a = b - Bw(i,j);
	i) For all RLij[m] in S, While a>0 do
		{  if a=<fij[m] then 
		  { tij[k][m] = a; 
		    tij[m][k] = a; 
		    a=0;
		  }
	   	   if a>fij[m] then 
		  { tij[k][m] = fij[m]; 
		    tij[m][k] = fij[m]; 
		    a =a-fij[m]; 
		  }
		   S = S - { RLij[m] };}
		   
G.S Kuo et al. - Internet Draft - Expires                    [page 7]
           
draft-ietf-kuo-gmpls-recovery-resource-sharing-00.txt   February 2004    

		
   Note that the resource allocation procedure of protection LSP is 
   more complex than that of working LSP since more information 
   would be refreshed. In addition, the refresh of WLij, RLij, PLij and
   fij[k] are easier to understand than computation of tij[k][m]. When 
   computing tij[k][m], a set S, which contains the protection LSP IDs 
   with which the new protection LSP Plsp may share bandwidth, is 
   obtained first. Then, some LSPs in S are selected to share 
   bandwidth with Plsp.  Next, the amount of shared bandwidth of each 
   selected LSP RLij[m] is computed. Finally, both tij[k][m] and 
   tij[m][k] are updated.

5.2 Resource release

   The resource release also consists of two procedures: resource 
   release for working LSP and resource release for protection LSP. 
   The resource release procedures are as follows:
   
   Proc.1) A working LSP Wlsp is being released. LSP ID of Wlsp is X 
   	   and bandwidth demand is b units. For any link l(i, j) along 
   	   Wlsp, when node i receives PATHTEAR message:
        a) Rij = Rij + b;
	b) WLij = WLij-{X};

   Proc.2) A new protection LSP Plsp is being released. LSP ID of Plsp 
   	   is Y and bandwidth demand is b units. Let c denote the 
   	   bandwidth that will be actually released. For any link 
   	   l(i, j) along Plsp, when node i receives PATHTEAR message:
	a) RLij = RLij - { RLij[k] };  (Suppose RLij[k] = Y;)
	b) PLij = PLij - { PLij[k] };
	c) tmp=0;
	d) For all m
	     if tij[k][m] <> 0 then
	     {
		tij[m][k]=0;
  		tmp = tmp + tij[k][m];
  		tij[k][m]=0;
	     }
	e) c = fij[k] - tmp;
	f) fij[k] = 0;
	g) Rij = Rij + c;
	h) Bij = Bij - c;

   The release of working LSP is quite easy to implement. Much 
   attention should be paid to protection LSP release. When protection 
   LSP Plsp is setup, it may share some reserved resources with others. 
   Also, some resources allocated to Plsp may be shared by other prot-
   ection LSPs during the hold time of Plsp. These shared resources 
   should not be released when Plsp is released. So, the key point for 
   resource release is to know about the information of shared 
   resources in all links. In the above procedures, the release of Plsp  
   can be achieved efficiently because the required information of  
   fij[k] and tij[k][m], which are updated in resource allocation  
   procedures, can be obtained on node i easily.

   The resource allocation and release procedures can be illustrated 
   using the following network topology:
                    
               ======X(3)=======  
              a-----------------b
              |======Y(5)=======|             
              |* *           * *|      working LSP
              |* *           * *|      ==========
              |* ****Y'(5)**** *|
              |******X'(3)******|      Protection LSP
              c-----------------d      *************  
              |******Z'(7)******|
              |*               *|
              |*               *|
              |*               *|
              e-----------------f   
               ======Z(7)=======
            
   In the initial state, two working LSPs X and Y are established  
   between nodes a and b. The bandwidth demands of X and Y are 3 and 5  
   units respectively. The protection LSPs for X and Y are X'={a,c,d,b}  
   and Y'={a,c,d,b}. Note that X' and Y' can not share recovery  
   resources since X and Y are not physically disjoint. Thus, we can  
   obtain Bcd=8, RLcd={X',Y'}, PLcd={X,Y}, fcd[1]=3, fcd[2]=5,  
   tcd[1][2]=0 and tcd[2][1]=0. Now, a new LSP Z is setup between nodes  
   e and f with 7 units of bandwidth demand. The protection LSP for Z 
   is Z'={e,c,d,f}.  Clearly, no resource requires to be allocated on  
   l(c,d) because Z' can share resources with X' and Y' due to the  
   fact that LSP Z is disjoint with LSPs X and Y. 
   
   In terms of above resource allocation procedures, we obtain Bcd=8, 
   RLcd={X',Y',Z'}, PLcd={X,Y,Z}, fcd[1]=3, fcd[2]=5, fcd[3]=7, 
   tcd[1][3]=3, tcd[2][3]=4, tcd[3][1]=3 and tcd[3][2]=4 after Z' is 
   established. Next, we give the examples of shared resource release 
   on l(c,d). Three situations will be considered, which are releasing 
   Z' first, releasing X' first and releasing Y' first.  
   
   i) Releasing Z' first: In this situation, LSP Z expires before X and
      Y. According to the resource release procedures, the bandwidth 
      would be released for Z' on l(c, d) is computed as 
      fcd[3]-tcd[3][1]-tcd[3][2]=0. So, no resource should be released 
      when releasing Z'. Thus, the refreshed information is Bcd=8, 
      RLcd={X',Y'}, PLcd={X,Y}, fcd[1]=3, fcd[2]=5, tcd[1][2]=0 and 
      tcd[2][1]=0, which is the same as that in the initial state. 	
   
   ii) Releasing X' first: On l(c,d), the recovery resources for X' are 
       all shared by Z', thus, the bandwidth would be released for X' 
       is fcd[1]-tcd[1][3]=0. After X' is released, the refreshed info-
       rmation is Bcd=8, RLcd={Y',Z'}, PLcd={Y,Z}, fcd[1]=5, fcd[2]=7, 
       tcd[1][2]=4 and tcd[2][1]=4.

   iii) Releasing Y' first: When releasing Y', only parts of recovery 
   	resources for it should be released because some recovery 
   	resources are being shared by Z'. Here, the bandwidth released 
   	is fcd[2]-tcd[2][3]=1. In terms of resource release  
   	procedures, we obtain the refreshed information on l(c,d), 
   	which is Bcd=7, RLcd={X',Z'}, PLcd={X,Z}, fcd[1]=3, fcd[2]=7, 
   	tcd[1][2]=3 and tcd[2][1]=3. 
   	
6. Performance evaluation

   We evaluated the performance of Proper Information approach in 
   different tested networks by simulation. Two aspects are examined, 
   1) recovery overhead, which is the rate of the total bandwidth 
   allocated for working LSP to the total bandwidth reserved for prote-
   ction LSP in networks. 2) rejected requests. 
   
   The proposed scheme has been compared to a Full Information  
   approach (see [GLI]), which has optimal performance in recovery 
   overhead. The results show that the scheme gives a performance 
   difference of less than 3% in recovery overhead compared to [GLI].  
   However, the number of rejected requests in [GLI] is always double 
   of that for the proposed scheme. Clearly, the Proper Information 
   approach decreases the rejected requests in networks significantly
   due to its capability of traffic balancing. 
   
7. Application to LSP segments protection and restoration

   The Proper Information approach can be applied to LSP segments prot-
   ection and restoration without any modification. But the performance
   needs further study.
   
8. Conclusion

   This draft discussed the issue of recovery resource sharing with 
   traffic balancing in GMPLS networks. We proposed the Proper Informa-
   tion approach to provision the capability of recovery resource 
   sharing and traffic balancing.  The Proper Information approach needs 
   less additional information than other approaches. Moreover, no 
   additional signaling procedure is required. We highlighted the 
   implementation of it, including resource allocation and release 
   procedures. And, the proposed scheme indeed improves resource
   utilization and decreases the rejected requests in networks.
