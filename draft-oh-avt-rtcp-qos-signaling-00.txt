1  Introduction 

   As we move toward next-generation all-IP wireless networks, we 
   are facing the integration of heterogeneous networks, such as 
   WWAN and WLAN, where the vertical handover (VHO : Handover 
   between heterogeneous access networks) is required.  In vertical 
   handover, mobile hosts should be able to move freely across 
   different networks while satisfying QoS requirements for a variety 
   of applications.  Considering these day's applications require 
   accurate synchronization and fast interaction, it is very natural
   to use RTP and RTCP as its transport layer.  

   In order to provide consistent QoS control over an integrated 
   heterogeneous access network, end-to-end QoS renegotiation procedure 
   using RTCP feedback capacity is proposed in this document.  The 
   control protocol, RTCP, provides for periodic reporting of reception 
   quality, participant identification and other source description 
   information, notification on changes in session membership, and
   the information needed to synchronize media streams. 

   This document defines and extends these RTCP functionalities
   to provide with the end-to-end QoS renegotiation using fast in-band
   signaling during the active session states. The main purpose of
   this new function of RTCP is to support the seamless VHO with 
   different QoS factors such as available bandwidth etc.

    
   1.1  Definitions

   The definitions from RTP/RTCP [1] and the RTCP feedback [2] apply.
   In addition, the following definitions are used in this document:


   Candidate access network :
           An access network to which a mobile node requests to move
           from the previous access network.

   Correspondent node : 
           An RTP entity that transmits media packets as well as RTCP
           packets and receives Regular as well as QoS renegotiation
           request packet.  This node must be able to modify active
           active session features such as transmisssion rate and 
           flow specification etc. so as to handle the QoS 
           renegotiation request from the mobile node.

   Crossover Router :
           A router that manages the layer 2 tunnels of previous access 
           network and candidate access network. The old and new layer 
           2 tunnels can be divided and merged here. In 3GPP 
           specification, crossover router can be Packet Data Gateway
           (PDG) which should be the SGSN or GGSN depending on the 
           inter-network architecture. There should be some additional
           functionalites to monitor the handover request and switch
           the layer 2 tunnels so as not to lose any packets during
           handover. 

   Horizontal Handover :
           Handover in homogeneous access networks.

   L2 trigger event : 
           An observation made by the layer 2 of mobile node which 
           is (potentially) of interest to the sender -- such as a 
           handover triggering or request of service level change, etc. 
           -- and thus useful to be reported back to the sender by 
           means of a Feedback message. This feedback message can
           be delivered as the early RTCP packet [2] in early RTCP
           mode [2].

   Layer 2 tunnel :
           used for integrating multi-protocol dial-up services into 
           existing Internet Service Providers Point of Presence. 
           PPP defines an encapsulation mechanism for transporting 
           multiprotocol packets across layer 2 (L2) point-to-point links. 
           Typically, a user obtains a L2 connection to a Network Access 
           Server (NAS) using one of a number of techniques (e.g., 
           dialup POTS, ISDN,ADSL, etc.) and then runs PPP over that 
           connection.
  
   Mobile node : 
           An RTP entity that receives media packets as well as RTCP 
           packets and transmits Regular as well as QoS renegotiation
           request packet.  This node must detect the handover event
           and decide whether it can do handover negotiating with
           the radio resource management functions in each access
           network.  And as it decides to do handover, it should
           initiates the radio channel setup to candidate access 
           network and QoS renegotiation with Correspondent node. 

   Previous access network : 
           An access network from which a mobile node requests to move
           to the candidate access network because the signal strength
           of it decreases to the level with which a mobile node cannot
           recognize the bit information any more.

   QoS renegotiation message : 
           One kind of RTCP feedback message [2] newly defined in this 
           document is used to convey information about events observed
           at a mobile node -- in addition to long-term receiver status
           information which is carried in RTCP RRs -- back to the 
           sender of the media stream (Correspondent Node).

   Vertical Handover (VHO) :
           Handover between heterogeneous access networks such as WWAN
           and WLAN.

     
   1.2  Terminology 
    
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
    in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 
    [5]. 

    
    
2  QoS issues in seamless VHO 
 
   2.1  Handover decision 
    
   Not like the handover in homogeneous wireless systems (horizontal
   handover), following challenges exist in VHO.

   o  When a user moves from WWAN to WLAN, since the WWAN is usually
      always on, the handoff cannot be triggered by signal decay of the
      current system, as in horizontal handoff.

   o  In vertical handoff between WWAN and WLAN, there is no comparable
      signal strength available to aid the decision as in horizontal
      handoff

   o  During a handoff procedure, the metrics upper-layer applications
      are really interested in are network conditions (available band-
      width and delay, user preference, etc), rather than the physical
      layer parameters such as received signal strength and signal-to-
      interference ratio.

   2.2  Radio Resource Management 
    
   Users are going to be requesting different services with different
   QoS parameters and values. In this context, Radio Resource Management
   (RRM) strategies or functions will be fundamental in providing the
   QoS required, which means focusing on handover management and call
   admission control are the issues of RRM.

   2.2.1 Handover Management
   In general, this kind of RRM is to support for terminal mobility 
   wherever the mobile node changes its point of attachment to the 
   network. Each handover means network resources have to route the 
   call to the next base station. If handover does not occur quickly, 
   the QoS may degrade to below an acceptable level and the connection 
   will be dropped.


   2.2.2 Call Admission Control
   Call Admission Control (CAC) is a provisioning strategy used to 
   limit the number of call connections into the networks in order to 
   reduce the network congestion and provide the desired QoS to already 
   established connections. The function of CAC is to make the decision 
   of whether to accept or reject a new connection request (call) with 
   certain traffic characteristics and associated QoS parameters.   


   2.3 Routing path update

   This issue is closely related with the interworking network 
   architecture which has been supposed to be tightly or loosely. 
   Each way of network integration has its own characteristic features
   like below

   Tightly integrated : 

   o  It makes one network appear as another, e.g., makes a WLAN network
      appear as another WWAN network.
   o  Each network emulates the function of the other, i.e., a WLAN 
      network injects traffic into WWAN network using WWAN networking 
      protocols.
   o  Typically, the same operator shares the different types of networks,
      i.e., same operator owns the WWAN as well as WLAN networks.
   o  Possible to allow different operators also.

Internet Draft    draft-oh-avt-rtcp-qos-signaling-00.txt    14 June 2004 



   Loosely coupled :

   o  It is kind of master slave architecture, e.g., WWAN could be the 
      master and WLAN, the slave.
   o  Combined emulator for several networks, e.g. a WLAN ESS connected
      to a combined WWAN Gateway emulator.
   o  Each network uses different IP addresses in different domains.
   o  It requires different handling of signaling and data traffic. 
      Signaling goes to the wireless network and data goes directly to
      the IP network
   
   In terms of routing path update, the tightly integrated network arch-
   tecture is much more efficient because it needs no change in IP 
   address and can have fast handover with less packet loss.


3. QoS renegotiation after handover

   It is generally considered that radio resource which can be proposed
   as available radio bandwidth is the most important QoS factor in VHO,
   and the different available bandwidth between heterogeneous access 
   network, e.g. WWAN and WLAN, is therefore the most big problem we have
   to get over. This section shows the role of Mobile node, Correspondent
   node and crossover router and how these nodes can interact to handle
   this bandwidth problem in VHO procedure.   

   3.1  Basic assumption in seamless VHO

   Not like the horizontal handover, VHO has some special features like
   below

   o  Dual connectivity over wireless :

      In general, VHO possible mobile node is equipped with more than two
      kind of network interface card, e.g. CDMA modem for WWAN, LAN card
      for WLAN, which can provide with more than two different wireless
      connectivity during handover.  This can be supported with Multi-
      homing scheme discussed in other working groups.  Based on this
      features of VHO, we can assume that if we properly design the hand-
      over schemes and network architecture, it is possible to have no
      packet delay or loss during VHO.


   3.2  The role of RTCP in Immediate Feedback Mode

   Regular RTCP mode is based on periodical way to report reception 
   quality, participant identification and other source description 
   information, notification on changes in session membership, and
   the information needed to synchronize media streams.  But this mode
   cannot support the event-driven signaling for handover and QoS 
   renegotiation.  By using Immediate Feedback Mode [2], the mobile
   node can directly report its handover event and QoS renegotiation
   request caused by radio resource allocation procedure.

Internet Draft   draft-oh-avt-rtcp-qos-signaling-00.txt    14 June 2004 



   3.3  The role of Crossover router

   Crossover router can manage the states of the RTP flows to
   remove the packet loss or delay during the VHO caused by the narrower
   bandwidth which the candidate access network can provide with.
   States which the crossover router can manage are "Active" and
   "VHO_pending".  "Active" is the usual state in which every RTP
   packet go through crossover router without any checking inside.
   As mobile node starts VHO and is notified that less resource than
   requested can be available in the candidate network, it must send 
   this situation to crossover router as well as to correspondent node.  
   
   Right after the crossover router receives information from the mobile
   node, its state transits to "VHO_pending".  "VHO_pending" is the 
   newly designed state in which the router can look into the 'M' bit 
   of RTP common header just to see the RTP sender (correspondent node) 
   change its QoS level as requested by the mobile node.

   The crossover router in "VHO_pending" will prepare the new layer 2 
   tunnel through candidate access network but still transmits the 
   packets through the old layer 2 tunnel.  As The crossover router in 
   "VHO_pending" can look into the "M' bit of RTP packet, The RTP sender
   can notify its execution of modifying QoS level to the crossover 
   router by setting the "M" bit.  Right after the crossover router finds
   the "M" set, it transits from "VHO_pending to "Active" again.


   +----------+         +-------------+         +----------+
   |  Active  |  <--->  | VHO_pending |  <--->  |  Active  | 
   +----------+         +-------------+         +----------+
   


   3.4  Procedure

   As the medium access control (MAC)-layer of mobile node senses and 
   delivers the handover related information to the upper layer, the
   radio resource module of mobile node asks to get the required radio
   resource from the candidate access network.  If the candidate access 
   network can support the required amount of radio resource for the 
   mobile node, it simply set up the new layer 2 tunnel from the cross-
   over router to the mobile node through the candidate access network
   and switch it with old layer 2 tunnel which cover from the crossover
   router to the mobile node through the previous access network.

   If the candidate access network cannot support the required amount
   of radio resource for the mobile node, it notify this to the mobile
   node with the current available amount of radio resources.  Then
   the mobile node has to have two kind of signaling with crossover
   router and correspondent node respectively.  The correspondent node
   should be the RTP sender as well.

Internet Draft   draft-oh-avt-rtcp-qos-signaling-00.txt    14 June 2004 



   Getting the signal message for VHO with minimum possible radio res-
   ource, the crossover router set up the new layer 2 tunnel.  Instead
   of switching to new layer 2 tunnel immediately, the crossover router
   changes the session state from "Active " to "VHO_pending".  The 
   correspondent node which should be notified with QoS renegotiation 
   from the mobile node will set the 'M' bit of RTP right after it 
   finishes the modification of the QoS level of that flow.  Getting the
   RTP packet with 'M' bit set from the correspondent node, the crossover
   router will immediately change its state from "VHO_pending" to "Active"
   and switch the old layer 2 tunnel with the new layer 2 tunnel.

   This layer 2 tunnel switching procedure executed by crossover router
   can remove the packet loss caused by the narrower bandwidth which 
   the candidate access network can provide with.

4  Format of RTCP Feedback Message for QoS renegotiation
    
   This section defines the format of the Application layer message
   [2] which can be used as QoS renegotiation request during VHO. 

   This message is used to transport VHO support module defined data 
   directly from the receiver's to the sender's application. Therefore, 
   the application MUST be able to identify the messages payload. 
    
   Usually, VHO support module defines its own set of messages, This
   messages do not need any additional information from the RTCP  
   message.  Thus the application message is simply placed into 
   the Feedback Control Information (FCI) field [2] as follows and 
   the length field is set accordingly.     
    
    0                   1                   2                   3

5  Security Considerations 
    
   This QoS renegotiation signaling using RTCP FB message is designed
   based on end-to-end scheme to prevent from the various kind of 
   attacks.  Hence, this profile does not specify any additional 
   security services.   
 
   This profile modifies the timing behavior of RTCP and eliminates 
   the minimum RTCP interval of five seconds and allows for earlier 
   feedback to be provided by receivers.  Group members of the 
   associated RTP session (possibly pretending to represent a large 
   number of entities) may disturb the operation of RTCP by sending 
   large numbers of RTCP packets thereby reducing the RTCP bandwidth 
   available for Regular RTCP reporting as well as for Early FB 
   messages.  All of these problems can be solved by the methods 
   mentioned in [2]
