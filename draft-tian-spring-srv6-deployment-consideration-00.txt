1.  Introduction

   SRv6 is the instantiation of Segment Routing deployed on the IPv6
   data plane[RFC8200].  Therefore, in order to support SRv6, the
   network must first be enabled for IPv6.  Over the past several years,
   IPv6 has been actively promoted all over the world, and the
   deployments of IPv6 have been ever-increasing which provides the
   basis for the deployments of SRv6.

   With IPv6 as its data plane, for network migration towards SRv6, both
   software and hardware need to be upgraded.  Compared with other new

Internet-Draft        SRv6 Deployment Consideration        November 2019


   protocols, only IGP and BGP need to be extended to support SRv6,
   which significantly simplifies the software upgrade required.  While
   the hardware needs to support the new SRv6 header
   SRH[I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header], the design of SRv6 assures
   compatibility with the existing IPv6 network as an SRv6 SID is
   designed as a 128-bit IPv6 address and the encapsulation of an SRv6
   packet is the same as an IPv6 packet.  When only L3VPN over SRv6 BE
   (Best-Effort) is deployed, there will be no SRH.  Therefore, no
   additional hardware capabilities are required but only software
   upgrade for protocol extensions.

   As the number of services supported by SRv6 increase, e.g.  SFC,
   network slicing, iOAM etc., more SIDs in the SRH may impose new
   requirements on the hardware.  Besides upgrading the hardware,
   various solutions [I-D.peng-spring-srv6-compatibility] have already
   been proposed to relieve the imposed pressure on the hardware, such
   as Binding SID (BSID) etc. to guarantee the compatibility with the
   existing network.  On the other hand SRv6 has many more advantages
   over SR-MPLS for the network migration to support new services.

   This document summarizes the advantages of SRv6 and provides network
   migration guidance and recommendations on solutions in various
   scenarios.

2.  Advantages of SRv6

   Compared with SR-MPLS, SRv6 has significant advantages especially in
   large scale networking scenarios.

2.1.  IP Route Aggregation

   The increasing complexity of service deployment is of concern for
   network operators, especially in large-scale networking scenarios.
   With solutions such as multi-segment PW and Option A [RFC4364], the
   number of service-touch points has increased, and the services, with
   associated OAM features cannot be deployed end-to-end.

   o  With Seamless MPLS or SR-MPLS, since the MPLS label itself does
      not have reachability information, it must be attached to a
      routable address.  The 32-bit host route needs to leak across
      domains.  For an extreme case, as shown in Figure 1a, in a large
      scale networking scenario, millions of host route LSPs might need
      to be imported, which places big challenges on the capabilities of
      the edge nodes.

   o  With SRv6, owing to its native IP feature of route aggregation as
      shown in Figure 1b, the aggregated routes can be imported across
      network domains.  For large scale networking, only very few

      aggregated routes are needed in order to start end-to-end
      services, which also reduces the scalability requirements on the
      edge nodes.

2.2.  End-to-end Service Auto-start

   In the SR cross-domain scenario, in order to set up end-to-end SR
   tunnels, the SIDs in each domain need to be imported to other
   domains.



Tian, et al.               Expires May 7, 2020                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        SRv6 Deployment Consideration        November 2019


   o  With SR-MPLS, SRGB and Node SID need overall network-wide
      planning, and in the cross-domain scenario, it is difficult or
      sometimes even impossible to perform as the node SIDs in different
      domains may collide.  BGP Prefix SID can be used for the cross-
      domain SID import, but the network operator must be careful when
      converting the SID to avoid SID collision.  Moreover, the pre-
      allocated SRGB within each domain needs to consider the total
      number of devices in all other domains, which raises difficulties
      for the network-wide planning.

   o  With SRv6, owing to its native IP feature of route reachability,
      if the IPv6 address space is carefully planned, and the aggregated
      routes are imported by using BGP4+ (BGP IPv6), the services will
      auto-start in the cross-domain scenario.

2.3.  On-Demand Upgrade

   The MPLS label itself does not hold any reachability information, so
   it must be attached to a routable address, which means that the
   matching relationship between the label and FEC needs to be
   maintained along the path.

   SR-MPLS uses the MPLS data plane.  When the network migrates to SR-
   MPLS, there are two ways, as shown in Figure 2:

   1.  MPLS/SR-MPLS Dual stack: the entire network is upgraded first and
       then deploy SR-MPLS.

   2.  MPLS and SR-MPLS interworking: mapping servers are deployed at
       some of the intermediate nodes and then removed once the entire
       network is upgraded

   Regardless of which migration option is chosen, big changes in a wide
   area is required at the initial stage therefore causing a long time-
   to-market.

   In contrast, the network can be migrated to SRv6 on demand.  Wherever
   the services need to be turned on, only the relevant devices need to
   be upgraded to enable SRv6, and all other devices only need to
   support IPv6 forwarding and need not be aware of SRv6.  When Traffic
   Engineering (TE) services are needed, only the key nodes along the
   path need to be upgraded to support SRv6.

3.  Incremental Deployment Guidance for SRv6 Migration

   Incremental deployment is the key for a smooth network migration to
   SRv6.  In order to quickly launch SRv6 network services and enjoy the
   benefits brought by SRv6, the recommended incremental SRv6 deployment
   steps are given as follows.  These are based on practical deployment
   experience earned from the use cases described in
   [I-D.matsushima-spring-srv6-deployment-status].

   The referenced network topology is shown in Figure 3.

   Step1.  All the network devices are upgraded to support IPv6.

   Step 2.  According to service demands, only a set of selected PE
   devices are upgraded to support SRv6 in order to immediately deploy
   SRv6 overlay VPN services.  For instance, in Figure 3, PE1 and PE2
   are SRv6-enabled.

   Step 3.  Besides the PE devices, some P devices are upgraded to
   support SRv6 in order to deploy loose TE which enables network path
   adjustment and optimization.  SFC is also a possible service provided
   by upgrading some of the network devices.

   Step 4.  All the network devices are upgraded to support SRv6.  In
   this case, it is now possible to deploy strict TE, which enables the
   deterministic networking and other strict security inspection.

4.  Migration Guidance for SRv6/SR-MPLS Co-existence Scenario

   As the network migration to SRv6 is progressing, in most cases
   SRv6-based services and SR-MPLS-based services will coexist.

   As shown in Figure 4, in the Non-Standalone (NSA) case specified by
   3GPP Release 15, 5G networks will be supported by existing 4G
   infrastructure. 4G eNB connects to CSG 2, 5G gNB connects to CSG 1,
   and EPC connects to RSG 1.

   To support the 4G services, network services need to be provided
   between CSG 2 and RSG 1 for interconnecting 4G eNB and EPC, while for
   the 5G services, network services need to be deployed between CSG 1
   and RSG 1 for interconnecting 5G gNB and EPC.  Meanwhile, to support
   X2 interface between the eNB and gNB, network services also need to
   be deployed between the CSG 1 and CSG 2.

   As shown in Figure 4, in most of the current network deployments,
   MPLS-based network services may have already existed between CSG 2
   and RSG 1 for interconnecting 4G eNB and EPC for 4G services.

   When 5G services are to be supported, more stringent network services
   are required, e.g. low latency and high bandwidth.  SRv6-based
   network services could be deployed between CSG 1 and RSG 1 for
   interconnecting 5G gNB and EPC.

   In order to perform smooth network migration, a dual-stack solution
   can be adopted which deploys both SRv6 and MPLS stack in one node.

   With the dual-stack solution, only CSG 1 and RSG 1 need to be
   upgraded with SRv6/MPLS dual stack.  In this case, CSG 1 can
   immediately start SRv6-based network services to RSG 1 for support of
   5G services, but continue to use MPLS-based services to CSG 2 for X2
   interface communications.  The upgrade at CSG 1 will not affect the
   existing 4G services supported by the MPLS-based network services
   between CSG 2 and RSG 1.  RSG1 can provide MPLS services to CSG2 for
   4G services as well as SRv6 services to CSG 1 for 5G services.

5.  Deployment cases

   With the current network, the launch of leased line service is slow,
   the network operation and maintainence is complex, and the
   configuration points are many.  SRv6 can solve the issues above.
   There have already been several successful SRv6 deployments following
   the incremental deployment guidance shown in Section 3.

Internet-Draft        SRv6 Deployment Consideration        November 2019


5.1.  China Telecom Si'chuan

   China Telecom Si'chuan (Si'chuan Telecom) has enabled SRv6 at the PE
   node of the Magic-Mirror DC in Mei'shan, Cheng'du, Pan'zhihua and
   other cities.  The SRv6 BE tunnel has been deployed through the 163
   backbone network which has the IPv6 capability.  It enables the fast
   launch of the Magic-Mirror video service, the interconnection of the
   DCs in various cities, and the isolation of video services.  The
   deployment case is shown in Figure 6.

              IGP/IBGP             EBGP               IGP/IBGP
             |<------->|<-------------------------->|<-------->|
                                 EBGP VPNv4 Peer
             |<----------------------------------------------->|
                                L3VPN over SRv6
             |<----------------------------------------------->|

            Figure 6. China Telecom Si'chuan deployment case


   As shown in Figure 6, IGP (some cities such as Chengdu deploy ISIS,
   while other cities such as Panzhihua deploy OSPF) and IBGP are
   deployed between PE and CR, and EBGP is deployed between CRs of
   cities in order to advertise the aggregation route.  EBGP VPNv4 peers
   are set up between PEs in different cities to deliver VPN private
   network routes.

   The packet enters the SRv6 BE tunnel from the egress PE of DC, and
   the packet is forwarded according to the Native IP of the 163
   backbone network.  When the packet reaches the peer PE, the SRH is
   decapsulated, and then the IP packet is forwarded in the VRF
   according to the service SID (for example, End.DT4).

   In order to further implement the path selection, ASBRs can be
   upgraded to support SRv6.  Different SRv6 policies are configured on
   the DC egress PE so that different VPN traffic reaches the peer PE

   through the 163 backbone network and the CN2 backbone network
   respectively.

5.2.  China Unicom

   China Unicom has deployed SRv6 L3VPN over 169 IPv6 backbone network
   from Guangzhou to Beijing to provide inter-domain Cloud VPN service.
   The deployment case is shown in Figure 7.

    |<----------------------- L3VPN over SRv6 --------------------->|

                   Figure 7. China Unicom SRv6 L3VPN case


   In Guangzhou and Beijing metro networks, routers exchange basic
   routing information using IGP(OSPF/ISIS).  The prefixes of IPv6
   loopback address and SRv6 locator of routers are different, and both
   of them need to be imported into the IGP.  The 169 backbone is a
   native IPv6 network.  Between metro and backbone, the border routers
   establish EBGP peer with each other, e.g.  CR1 with CR2, CR3 with
   CR4, to form basic connectivity.  All of these constitute the
   foundation of overlay services, and have not been changed.

   PE1 and PE2 establish EBGP peer and advertise VPNv4 routes with each
   other.  If one site connects to two PEs, metro network will use multi
   RD, community and local preference rules to choose one best route and
   one backup.

   After basic routing among networks and VPN routes between the two PEs
   are all ready, two PEs encapsulate and forward VPN traffic within
   SRv6 tunnel.  The tunnel is SRv6 best effort (BE) tunnel.  It
   introduces only outer IPv6 header but not SRH header into traffic
   packets.  After encapsulation, the packet is treated as common IPv6
   packet and forwarded to the egress PE, which performs decapsulation
   and forwards the VPN traffic according to specific VRF.

   Guangdong Unicom has also lauched the SRv6 L3VPN among Guangzhou,
   Shenzhen, and Dongguan, which has passed the interop test between
   different vendors.

   With SRv6 enabled at the PE devices, the VPN service can be launched
   very quickly without impact on the existing traffic.  With SRv6 TE
   further deployed, more benefits of using SRv6 can be exploited.
