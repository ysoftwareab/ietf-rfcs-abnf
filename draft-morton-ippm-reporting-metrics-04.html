<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Consumers of IP network performance metrics have many different uses
      in mind. This memo categorizes the different audience points of view. It
      describes how the categories affect the selection of metric parameters
      and options when seeking info that serves their needs. The memo then
      proceeds to discuss "long-term" reporting considerations (e.g, days,
      weeks or months, as opposed to 10 seconds).

Introduction</h3>

<p>When designing measurements of IP networks and presenting the
      results, knowledge of the audience is a key consideration. To present a
      useful and relevant portrait of network conditions, one must answer the
      following question:
</p>
<p>"How will the results be used?"
</p>
<p>There are two main audience categories:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Network Characterization - describes conditions in an IP network
          for quality assurance, troubleshooting, modeling, etc. The
          point-of-view looks inward, toward the network, and the consumer
          intends their actions there.
</li>
<li>Application Performance Estimation - describes the network
          conditions in a way that facilitates determining affects on user
          applications, and ultimately the users themselves. This
          point-of-view looks outward, toward the user(s), accepting the
          network as-is. This consumer intends to estimate a network-dependent
          aspect of performance, or design some aspect of an application's
          accommodation of the network. (These are *not* application metrics,
          they are defined at the IP layer.)
</li>
</ol><p>This memo considers how these different points-of-view affect
      both the measurement design (parameters and options of the metrics) and
      statistics reported when serving their needs.
</p>
<p>The IPPM framework <a class='info' href='#RFC2330'>[RFC2330]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V., Almes, G., Mahdavi, J., and M. Mathis, &ldquo;Framework for IP Performance Metrics,&rdquo; May&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> and other RFCs
      describing IPPM metrics provide a background for this memo.

Purpose and Scope</h3>

<p>The purpose of this memo is to clearly delineate two points-of-view
      (POV) for using measurements, and describe their effects on the test
      design, including the selection of metric parameters and reporting the
      results.
</p>
<p>The current scope of this memo is primarily limited to design and
      reporting of the loss and delay metrics <a class='info' href='#RFC2680'>[RFC2680]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M. Zekauskas, &ldquo;A One-way Packet Loss Metric for IPPM,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a>

      variation and reordering metrics where applicable. Sampling, or the
      design of the active packet stream that is the basis for the
      measurements, is also discussed.

Effect of POV on the Loss Metric</h3>

<p>This section describes the ways in which the Loss metric can be tuned
      to reflect the preferences of the two audience categories, or different
      POV. The waiting time to declare a packet lost, or loss threshold is one
      area where there would appear to be a difference, but the ability to
      post-process the results may resolve it.

Loss Threshold</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#RFC2680'>RFC 2680<span> (</span><span class='info'>Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M. Zekauskas, &ldquo;A One-way Packet Loss Metric for IPPM,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2680] defines the concept of a
        waiting time for packets to arrive, beyond which they are declared
        lost. The text of the RFC declines to recommend a value, instead
        saying that "good engineering, including an understanding of packet
        lifetimes, will be needed in practice." Later, in the methodology,
        they give reasons for waiting "a reasonable period of time", and
        leaving the definition of "reasonable" intentionally vague.
</p>
<a name="anchor5"></a><br /><hr />

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.1"></a><h3>3.1.1.&nbsp;
Network Characterization</h3>

<p>Practical measurement experience has shown that unusual network
          circumstances can cause long delays. One such circumstance is when
          routing loops form during IGP re-convergence following a failure or
          drastic link cost change. Packets will loop between two routers
          until new routes are installed, or until the IPv4 Time-to-Live (TTL)
          field (or the IPv6 Hop Limit) decrements to zero. Very long delays
          on the order of several seconds have been measured <a class='info' href='#Casner'>[Casner]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;A Fine-Grained View of High Performance Networking, NANOG 22           Conf.; http://www.nanog.org/mtg-0105/agenda.html,&rdquo; May 20-22&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> <a class='info' href='#Cia03'>[Cia03]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Standardized Active Measurements on a Tier 1 IP Backbone,           IEEE Communications Mag., pp 90-97.,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Therefore, network characterization activities prefer a long
          waiting time in order to distinguish these events from other causes
          of loss (such as packet discard at a full queue, or tail drop). This
          way, the metric design helps to distinguish more reliably between
          packets that might yet arrive, and those that are no longer
          traversing the network.
</p>
<p>It is possible to calculate a worst-case waiting time, assuming
          that a routing loop is the cause. We model the path between Source
          and Destination as a series of delays in links (t) and queues (q),
          as these two are the dominant contributors to delay. The normal path
          delay across n hops without encountering a loop, D, is<br /><hr class="insert" />

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>           n

<p>and the time spent in the loop with L hops, is

<p>
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>      i + L-1

       \                         (TTL - n)
R = C   &gt;   t  + q  where C    = ---------

<p>and where C is the number of times a packet circles the loop.
</p>
<p>If we take the delays of all links and queues as 100ms each, the
          TTL=255, the number of hops n=5 and the hops in the loop L=4,
          then

</p>
<p>We note that the link delays of 100ms would span most continents,
          and a constant queue length of 100ms is also very generous. When a
          loop occurs, it is almost certain to be resolved in 10 seconds or
          less. The value calculated above is an upper limit for almost any
          realistic circumstance.
</p>
<p>A waiting time threshold parameter, dT, set consistent with this
          calculation would not truncate the delay distribution (possibly
          causing a change in its mathematical properties), because the
          packets that might arrive have been given sufficient time to
          traverse the network.
</p>
<p>It is worth noting that packets that are stored and deliberately
          forwarded at a much later time constitute a replay attack on the
          measurement system, and are beyond the scope of normal performance
          reporting.

Application Performance</h3>

<p>Fortunately, application performance estimation activities are
          not adversely affected by the estimated worst-case transfer time.
          Although the designer's tendency might be to set the Loss Threshold
          at a value equivalent to a particular application's threshold, this
          specific threshold can be applied when post-processing the
          measurements. A shorter waiting time can be enforced by locating
          packets with delays longer than the application's threshold, and
          re-designating such packets as lost. Thus, the measurement system
          can use a single loss threshold and support both application and
          network performance POVs simultaneously.

Errored Packet Designation</h3>

<p>RFC 2680 designates packets that arrive containing errors as lost
        packets. Many packets that are corrupted by bit errors are discarded
        within the network and do not reach their intended destination.
</p>
<p>This is consistent with applications that would check the payload
        integrity at higher layers, and discard the packet. However, some
        applications prefer to deal with errored payloads on their own, and
        even a corrupted payload is better than no packet at all.
</p>
<p>To address this possibility, and to make network characterization
        more complete, it is recommended to distinguish between packets that
        do not arrive (lost) and errored packets that arrive (conditionally
        lost).

Causes of Lost Packets</h3>

<p>Although many measurement systems use a waiting time to determine

        packets are no-longer traversing the network, and have not reached
        their destination.
</p>
<p>There are many causes of packet loss, including:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Queue drop, or discard
</li>
<li>Corruption of the IP header, or other essential header info
</li>
<li>TTL expiration (or use of a TTL value that is too small)

Treatment of Lost Packets</h3>

<p>The Delay Metric <a class='info' href='#RFC2679'>[RFC2679]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M. Zekauskas, &ldquo;A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> specifies the
        treatment of packets that do not successfully traverse the network:
        their delay is undefined.
</p>
<p>" &gt;&gt;The *Type-P-One-way-Delay* from Src to Dst at T is

        receive that packet."
</p>
<p>It is an accepted, but informal practice to assign infinite delay
        to lost packets. We next look at how these two different treatments
        align with the needs of measurement consumers who wish to characterize
        networks or estimate application performance. Also, we look at the way
        that lost packets have been treated in other metrics: delay variation
        and reordering.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.1"></a><h3>4.1.1.&nbsp;
Application Performance</h3>

<p>Applications need to perform different functions, dependent on
          whether or not each packet arrives within some finite tolerance. In
          other words, a receivers' packet processing takes one of two
          directions (or "forks" in the road):
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Packets that arrive within expected tolerance are handled by
              processes that remove headers, restore smooth delivery timing
              (as in a de-jitter buffer), restore sending order, check for
              errors in payloads, and many other operations.
</li>
<li>Packets that do not arrive when expected spawn other
              processes that attempt recovery from the apparent loss, such as
              retransmission requests, loss concealment, or forward error
              correction to replace the missing packet.
</li>
</ul><p>So, it is important to maintain a distinction between
          packets that actually arrive, and those that do not. Therefore, it
          is preferable to leave the delay of lost packets undefined, and to
          characterize the delay distribution as a conditional distribution
          (conditioned on arrival).

Network Characterization</h3>

<p>In this discussion, we assume that both loss and delay metrics
          will be reported for network characterization (at least).
</p>
<p>Assume packets that do not arrive are reported as Lost, usually
          as a fraction of all sent packets. If these lost packets are
          assigned undefined delay, then network's inability to deliver them
          (in a timely way) is captured only in the loss metric when we report
          statistics on the Delay distribution conditioned on the event of
          packet arrival (within the Loss waiting time threshold). We can say
          that the Delay and Loss metrics are Orthogonal, in that they convey
          non-overlapping information about the network under test.
</p>
<p>However, if we assign infinite delay to all lost packets,
          then:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The delay metric results are influenced both by packets that
              arrive and those that do not.
</li>
<li>The delay singleton and the loss singleton do not appear to
              be orthogonal (Delay is finite when Loss=0, Delay is infinite
              when Loss=1).
</li>
<li>The network is penalized in both the loss and delay metrics,
              effectively double-counting the lost packets.
</li>
</ul>

<p>As further evidence of overlap, consider the Cumulative
          Distribution Function (CDF) of Delay when the value positive
          infinity is assigned to all lost packets. <a class='info' href='#CDF'>Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Cumulative Distribution Function for Delay when Loss = +Infinity</span><span>)</span></a>

<p>We note that a Delay CDF that is conditioned on packet arrival
          would not exhibit this apparent overlap with loss.
</p>
<p>Although infinity is a familiar mathematical concept, it is
          somewhat disconcerting to see any time-related metric reported as
          infinity, in the opinion of the authors. Questions are bound to
          arise, and tend to detract from the goal of informing the consumer
          with a performance report.

Delay Variation</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#RFC3393'>[RFC3393]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Demichelis, C. and P. Chimento, &ldquo;IP Packet Delay Variation Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> excludes lost packets from
          samples, effectively assigning an undefined delay to packets that do
          not arrive in a reasonable time. Section 4.1 describes this
          specification and its rationale (ipdv = inter-packet delay variation
          in the quote below).
</p>
<p>"The treatment of lost packets as having "infinite" or
          "undefined" delay complicates the derivation of statistics for ipdv.
          Specifically, when packets in the measurement sequence are lost,
          simple statistics such as sample mean cannot be computed. One
          possible approach to handling this problem is to reduce the event
          space by conditioning. That is, we consider conditional statistics;
          namely we estimate the mean ipdv (or other derivative statistic)
          conditioned on the event that selected packet pairs arrive at the
          destination (within the given timeout). While this itself is not
          without problems (what happens, for example, when every other packet
          is lost), it offers a way to make some (valid) statements about
          ipdv, at the same time avoiding events with undefined outcomes."

Reordering</h3>

          evaluation of packet arrival order, and include a waiting time to
          declare a packet lost (to exclude them from further processing).
</p>
<p>If packets are assigned a delay value, then the reordering metric
          would declare any packets with infinite delay to be reordered,
          because their sequence numbers will surely be less than the "Next
          Expected" threshold when (or if) they arrive. But this practice
          would fail to maintain orthogonality between the reordering metric
          and the loss metric. Confusion can be avoided by designating the
          delay of non-arriving packets as undefined, and reserving delay
          values only for packets that arrive within a sufficiently long
          waiting time.

Preferred Statistics</h3>

<p>Today in network characterization, the sample mean is one statistic
        that is almost ubiquitously reported. It is easily computed and
        understood by virtually everyone in this audience category. Also, the
        sample is usually filtered on packet arrival, so that the mean is
        based a conditional distribution.
</p>
<p>The median is another statistic that summarizes a distribution,
        having somewhat different properties from the sample mean. The median
        is stable in distributions with a few outliers or without them.
        However, the median's stability prevents it from indicating when a
        large fraction of the distribution changes value. 50% or more values
        would need to change for the median to capture the change.
</p>
<p>Both the median and sample mean have difficulty with bimodal
        distributions. The median will reside in only one of the modes, and
        the mean may not lie in either mode range. For this and other reasons,
        additional statistics such as the minimum, maximum, and 95%-ile have
        value when summarizing a distribution.
</p>
<p>When both the sample mean and median are available, a comparison
        will sometimes be informative, because these two statistics are equal
        only when the delay distribution is perfectly symmetrical.
</p>
<p>Also, these statistics are generally useful from the Application
        Performance POV, so there is a common set that should satisfy
        audiences.

Overview of Metric Statistics</h3>

<p>This section gives an overview of reporting recommendations for the
        loss, delay, and delay variation metrics based on the discussion and
        conclusions of the preceding sections.
</p>
<p>The minimal report on measurements MUST include both Loss and Delay
        Metrics.
</p>
<p>For Packet Loss, the loss ratio defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC2680'>[RFC2680]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M. Zekauskas, &ldquo;A One-way Packet Loss Metric for IPPM,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> is a sufficient starting point, especially
        the guidance for setting the loss threshold waiting time. We have
        calculated a waiting time above that should be sufficient to
        differentiate between packets that are truly lost or have long finite
        delays under general measurement circumstances, 51 seconds. Knowledge
        of specific conditions can help to reduce this threshold, but 51
        seconds is considered to be manageable in practice.
</p>
<p>We note that a loss ratio calculated according to <a class='info' href='#Y.1540'>[Y.1540]<span> (</span><span class='info'>ITU-T Recommendation Y.1540, &ldquo;Internet protocol data communication service - IP packet           transfer and availability performance parameters,&rdquo; December &nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> would exclude errored packets form the
        numerator. In practice, the difference between these two loss metrics
        is small if any, depending on whether the last link prior to the
        destination contributes errored packets.
</p>
<p>For Packet Delay, we recommend providing both the mean delay and
        the median delay with lost packets designated undefined (as permitted
        by <a class='info' href='#RFC2679'>[RFC2679]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M. Zekauskas, &ldquo;A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a>). Both statistics are based on a
        conditional distribution, and the condition is packet arrival prior to
        a waiting time dT, where dT has been set to take maximum packet
        lifetimes into account, as discussed above. Using a long dT helps to
        ensure that delay distributions are not truncated.
</p>
<p>For Packet Delay Variation (PDV), the minimum delay of the
        conditional distribution should be used as the reference delay for
        computing PDV according to <a class='info' href='#Y.1540'>[Y.1540]<span> (</span><span class='info'>ITU-T Recommendation Y.1540, &ldquo;Internet protocol data communication service - IP packet           transfer and availability performance parameters,&rdquo; December &nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> or <a class='info' href='#RFC3393'>[RFC3393]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Demichelis, C. and P. Chimento, &ldquo;IP Packet Delay Variation Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>. A useful value to report is a pseudo range
        of delay variation based on calculating the difference between a high
        percentile of delay and the minimum delay. For example, the 99.9%-ile
        minus the minimum will give a value that can be compared with
        objectives in <a class='info' href='#Y.1541'>[Y.1541]<span> (</span><span class='info'>ITU-T Recommendation Y.1540, &ldquo;Network Performance Objectives for IP-Based Services,&rdquo; February &nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Long-Term Reporting Considerations</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-ippm-reporting'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;ippm&#8209;reporting]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shalunov, S. and M. Swany, &ldquo;Reporting IP Performance Metrics to Users,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> describes methods to
        conduct measurements and report the results on a near-immediate time
        scale (10 seconds, which we consider to be "short-term").
</p>
<p>Measurement intervals and reporting intervals need not be the same
        length. Sometimes, the user is only concerned with the performance
        levels achieved over a relatively long interval of time (e.g, days,
        weeks, or months, as opposed to 10 seconds). However, there can be
        risks involved with running a measurement continuously over a long
        period without recording intermediate results:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Temporary power failure may cause loss of all the results to
            date.
</li>
<li>Measurement system timing synchronization signals may
            experience a temporary outage, causing sub-sets of measurements to
            be in error or invalid.
</li>
<li>Maintenance may be necessary on the measurement system, or its
            connectivity to the network under test.
</li>
</ul><p>For these and other reasons, such as </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>the constraint to collect measurements on intervals similar to
            user session length, or
</li>
<li>the dual-use of measurements in monitoring activities where
            results are needed on a period of a few minutes,
</li>
</ul><p>there is value in conducting measurements on intervals that
        are much shorter than the reporting interval.
</p>
<p>There are several approaches for aggregating a series of
        measurement results over time in order to make a statement about the
        longer reporting interval. One approach requires the storage of all
        metric singletons collected throughout the reporting interval, even
        though the measurement interval stops and starts many times.
</p>
<p>Another approach is described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-ippm-framework-compagg'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;ippm&#8209;framework&#8209;compagg]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Morton, A., &ldquo;Framework for Metric Composition,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> as "temporal
        aggregation". This approach would estimate the results for the
        reporting interval based on many individual measurement interval
        statistics (results) alone. The result would ideally appear in the
        same form as though a continuous measurement was conducted. A memo to
        address the details of temporal aggregation is yet to be prepared.
</p>
<p>Yet another approach requires a numerical objective for the metric,
        and the results of each measurement interval are compared with the
        objective. Every measurement interval where the results meet the
        objective contribute to the fraction of time with performance as
        specified. When the reporting interval contains many measurement
        intervals it is possible to present the results as "metric A was less
        than or equal to objective X during Y% of time.
</p>
<p>NOTE that numerical thresholds are not set in IETF performance work
        and are explicitly excluded from the IPPM charter.
