Internet-Draft    The 'application/ssml+xml' Media Type        July 2004


1.  Introduction

   Speech Synthesis Markup Language is an XML based markup language for
   assisting the generation of synthetic speech in web and other
   applications.  The essential role of the markup language is to give
   authors of synthesizable content a standard way to control aspects of
   speech output such as pronunciation, volume, pitch, rate and etc.
   across different synthesis-capable platforms.

   Feedback or discussion about this draft should be directed to the
   Voice Browser Working Group public mailing list, www-voice@w3.org
   with archives at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-voice/.

Internet-Draft    The 'application/ssml+xml' Media Type        July 2004


2.  Registration of MIME media type application/ssml+xml

2.1  MIME media type name

   application

2.2  MIME subtype name

   ssml+xml

2.3  Required parameters

   None.

2.4  Optional parameters

2.4.1  charset

   This parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter of
   the application/xml media type as specified in [RFC3023].

2.5  Encoding considerations

   By virtue of SSML content being XML, it has the same considerations
   when sent as "application/ssml+xml" as does XML.  See [RFC3023],
   section 3.2.

2.6  Fragment identifiers

   For documents labeled as 'application/ssml+xml', the fragment
   identifier notation is exactly that for application/xml, as specified
   in [RFC3023].

2.7  Security Considerations

   Several SSML instructions may cause arbitrary URIs to be
   dereferenced.  In this case, the security issues of [RFC1738],
   section 6, should be considered.

   In addition, because of the extensibility features of SSML, it is
   possible that "application/ssml+xml" may describe content that has
   security implications beyond those described here.  However, if the
   processor follows only the normative semantics of this specification,
   this content will be ignored.  Only in the case where the processor
   recognizes and processes the additional content, or where further
   processing of that content is dispatched to other processors, would
   security issues potentially arise.  And in that case, they would fall
   outside the domain of this registration document.

2.8  Interoperability considerations

   Because SSML is extensible, conformant "application/ssml+xml"
   processors can expect that content received is well-formed XML, but
   it cannot be guaranteed that the content is valid SSML or that the
   processor will recognize all of the elements and attributes in the
   document.

2.9  Published specification

   This media type registration is for SSML documents as described by
   the W3C SSML specification at [SSML].

2.10  Applications which use this media type

   There is no experimental, vendor specific, or personal tree
   predecessor to "application/ssml+xml", reflecting the fact that no
   applications currently recognize it.  This new type is being
   registered in order to allow for the expected deployment of SSML on
   the World Wide Web, as a first class XML application.

2.11  Additional information

2.11.1  Magic number(s)

   There is no single initial octet sequence that is always present in
   SSML documents.  See [RFC3023] for information pertaining to the
   identification of XML media types.

2.11.2  File extension(s)

   SSML documents are most often identified with the extensions ".ssml".

2.11.3  Macintosh File Type Code(s)

   TEXT

2.12  Person & email address to contact for further information

   Max Froumentin, <mf@w3.org>

2.13  Intended usage

   COMMON

2.14  Author/Change controller

   The SSML specification is a work product of the World Wide Web
