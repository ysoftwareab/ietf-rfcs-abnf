1.  Introduction

   When a multicast-capable interface becomes enabled, the IPv6 node
   generates a few link-local addresses as well as a global address.  It
   MUST join the all-nodes multicast address and solicited-node
   multicast address on that interface according to [RFC 2461].  If the
   node functions as a router, it also MUST join all-routers multicast
   address on that interface.

   The conventional IPv6 was designed based on assumption that lower
   layer will use 48 bit H/W address for the packet transmission.  For a
   node to capture such link-local multicast packets in Ethernet and
   Wireless LAN, it generates a set of corresponding Ethernet addresses
   which are mapped one-to-one to link-local IPv6 address.  That could
   be done by affixing well-known MAC prefix for IPv6 link-local
   multicast, 3333 (hexadecimal), to the last four octets of the IPv6
   multicast address [RFC 2464].  So same multicast group members can
   share same MAC address as well as same IPv6 link-local multicast
   address and capture the packets of the multicast groups it belongs
   to.  Therefore multicast MAC address sharing and the transmission of
   IPv6 packets with link-local scope are done in a distributed manner.

   On the other hand, the 802.16 [802.16] uses Connection ID (CID) for
   packet transmissions instead of 48-bit H/W address.  Whether IEEE
   802.16 Convergence Sublayer (CS) supports IPv6 over Ethernet or
   native IPv6, the IPv6 address finally should be mapped to CID for
   transmission, which necessitates a mechanism to share multicast CIDs
   among multicast group members.  In this draft, we propose two
   approaches for creating and sharing multicast CIDs for IPv6 link-
   local multicast packet (llm-packet) transmission.

3.  Approach to link-local multicast packet transmission in 802.16
    networks

   To enable the transmission of llm-packets in 802.16 networks,
   [NDPCPA] suggests two approaches; by using common CID (CCID) for
   multicast and by emulating multicast with unicast transmission.  With
   the later approach, the BS needs to copy and send original packets as
   many times as the number of multicast group members, requiring more
   processing in BS and network resource.  Therefore, the proposed
   scheme is based on multicast CID sharing approach.

   To transmit llm-packets over the link with multicast CID, each CID
   should be shared per link-local group members prior to packet
   transmission.  We classify multicast CID concept to three Link-local
   multicast CID (llm-CID) each of which is shared among the multicast
   group SSs.  Currently there are three llm-CIDs on a link; for all-
   nodes multicast group, all-routers multicast group, solicited-node
   multicast group.

   In the next section, we suggest mechanisms for llm-CIDs sharing , and
   describes how to support llm-packet transmissions with such llm-CIDs.

4.  The creation and sharing mechanism of multicast link-local CIDs

   We propose two approaches for sharing the llm-CIDs; one is a
   distributed approach without the intervention of BS and the other is
   a centralized approach controlled by BS.

4.1.  A distributed approach

   As mentioned in Section 1, in Ethernet networks and Wireless LAN, all
   IPv6 nodes generate the 48-bit H/W addresses for all-nodes and
   solicited-node multicast according to [RFC 2464].  Routers
   additionally create it for all-routers multicast.  In other words,
   IPv6 nodes generate several H/W addresses by themselves, and
   recognize llm-packets destined to each link-local multicast group.
   Therefore creation and sharing of common MAC address are done in a
   distributed manner without the intervention of centralized network
   entity like an access router or access point.  This approach is
   efficient because it requires neither additional message exchanges
   nor additional BS processing for assigning and sharing llm-CIDs.

   The proposed distributed mechanism takes a similar approach and
   assumes all SSs agree to perform same operation as [RFC 2464] does.
   When the 802.16 network interface is initialized, a SS generates a
   set of corresponding llm-CIDs by affixing well-known prefix n bit for
   IPv6 link-local multicast, to the 16-n bit of the IPv6 multicast
   address.  The well-known prefix will be allocated by IANA later and
   'n' will be decided with much consideration in later version.

   The followings show simple example.  If the SS's H/W address is 00:
   04:75:AA:19:A7, the IPv6 link-local multicast addresses are generated
   according to [RFC 2373].


   1) FF02::1 (IPv6 all-nodes multicast address)
   2) FF02::2 (IPv6 all-routers multicast address)
   3) FF02::1:FFAA:19A7 (IPv6 solicited-node multicast address)

   For instance, if four bits are assigned for the llm-CID prefix, or
   n=4, and the value is 1100, then the corresponding CIDs are generated
   as follows.

   1) 1100:0000:0000:0001 (All-nodes multicast CID)
   2) 1100:0000:0000:0002 (All-routers multicast CID)
   3) 1100:1001:1010:0111 (Solicited-node multicast CID)

4.2.  A centralized approach

   While a distributed approach does not depends on BS, llm-CIDs are
   allocated by BS in a centralized approach.  In this scheme llm-CIDs
   are not generated by each SSs but assigned by BS, and shared among
   SSs via some MAC messages for MBS (Multicast Broadcast Service).

   To create a connection for service flow in 802.16 networks, BS and SS
   exchange DSA-REQ & DSA-RSP messages prior to the packet transmission.
   A BS utilizes these messages to share llm-CIDs with SSs.  When a SS
   has a initiating llm-packet, it exchanges DSA-REQ & DSA-RSP messages
   with BS for the flow.  At this time the SS can send a DSA-REQ
   including MBS Contents Identifier TLV to request a llm-CID.  MBS
   Contents Identifier is the 16 bit vendor-specific or application-
   specific value which indicates the MBS service contents.  For
   example, for unsolicited NA and RA flow, MBS Contents CID TLV is set
   to the constants which indicate all-nodes multicast.  In this
   approach, the constants for all-nodes, all-routers and solicited-node
   multicast service need to be assigned by IANA and should be well-
   known to SSs and BS in advance.  As a response to a DSA-REQ, the BS
   responds with DSA-RSP including MBS Contents CID and corresponding
   llm-CID together.

   Note that when a BS is co-located with an access router, llm-CIDs can
   be decided among any available transport CIDs at BS's discretion
   (Single-BS access case in 802.16).  However, if an access router is
   connected to more than one BS and llm-packets are multicasted
   synchronously across multiple BSs on the same channel(Multi-BS access
   case), the multicast CID should be selected among multicast CID
   ranges defined [802.16e].

   A SS or BS may send a DSA-REQ including multiple MBS Contents TLVs at
   one time.  For example, a SS can request llm-CIDs for all-nodes and
   solicited-node multicast together by putting MBS Contents TLVs and
   llm-CIDs in same order within each TLV field.

5.  Link-local multicast packet transmission in 802.16 networks

5.1.  Link-local multicast packet transmission on a SS

   When a SS has llm-packets to send, it encapsulates a native IPv6
   packet or IPv6 within Ethernet packet with IEEE 802.16 header whose
   CID field is set to the corresponding llm-CID.  In previous example,
   if a SS sends an RS, it attaches 802.16 header with CID set to 1100:
   0000:0000:0002.

5.2.  Link-local multicast packet forwarding on a BS

   There are two cases when a BS forwards llm-packets to SSs; one is the
   packets from an access router and another is the packets from the SSs
   on the link.

   When a BS receives a packets from an access router, the BS's CS
   performs the classification to match the service flows to the
   corresponding 802.16 connections.  During the classification, BS maps
   the flows to CIDs based on IP address, port number, flow label, etc.
   If the packet is a llm-packet, BS fills the final 802.16 PDU's CID
   with llm-CID made according to Section 4.

   When a BS receives a packet from the SSs, it looks into the received
   packet's 802.16 header and checks whether the packet is llm-packet or
   not.  In a distributed approach, this can be done simply by checking
   the CID's prefix n bit.  If the packet is proved to a llm-packet,
   then the BS keeps the CID when it forwards to SSs finally.  The
   packet also needs to be deliverd to the access router and neighboring
   BSs under same subnet.  How to deliver the llm-packets depends on the
   kinds of CS and the deployed architectures, and for more detailed
   information refer to [IPTX80216].
