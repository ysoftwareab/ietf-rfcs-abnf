1.  Introduction

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] provides a means 
   for an offerer to describe the specifics of a session to an 
   answerer, and for the answerer to respond back with its session 
   specifics to the offerer.  These session specifics include offering 
   the codec or codecs to choose from, the specific IP address and port
   number the offerer wants to receive the RTP stream(s) on/at, the 
   particulars about the codecs the offerer wants considered or 
   mandated, and so on.  

   There are many facets within SDP to determine the Real-time 
   Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] details for the session 
   establishment between one or more endpoints, but identifying how the
   underlying network should process each stream still remains 
   under-specified. 

   The ability to identify a traffic flow by port number gives an 


Polk, et al.              Expires Jan 4, 2015                  [Page 2]
Internet-Draft         SDP trafficclass Attribute             July 2014

   indication to underlying network elements to treat traffic with 
   dissimilar ports in a different way, the same or in groups the same 
   - but different from other ports or groups of ports.

   Within the context of realtime communications, the labeling of an 
   RTP session based on media descriptor lines as just a voice and/or 
   video session is insufficient, and provides no guidelines to the 
   underlying network on how to treat the traffic. A more granular 
   labeling helps on several fronts to

   - inform application layer elements in the signaling path the 
     intent of this session.

   - inform the network on how to treat the traffic if the network is 
     configured to differentiate session treatments based on the type 
     of session the RTP is, including the ability to provide call 
     admission control based on the type of traffic in the network.

   - allow network monitoring/management of traffic types realtime and
     after-the-fact analysis.

   Some network operators want the ability to guarantee certain traffic
   gets a minimum amount of network bandwidth per link or through a 
   series of links that make up a network such as a campus or WAN, or a
   backbone. For example, a call center voice application might get at 
   least 20% of the available link bandwidth.

   Some network operators want the ability to allow certain users or 
   devices access to greater bandwidth during non-busy hours than 
   during busy hours of the day. For example, all desktop video might 
   operate at 1080p during non-peak times, but a similar session might 
   be curtailed between the same users or devices to 720p or 360p 
   during peak hours.  Another example would be to reduce the frames 
   per second (fps) rate, say from 30fps to 15fps. This case is not as 
   clear as accepting or denying similar sessions during different 
   times of the day, but tuning the access to the bandwidth based on 
   the type of session. In other words, tune down the bandwidth for 
   desktop video during peak hours to allow a 3-screen Telepresence 
   session that would otherwise look like the same type of traffic 
   (RTP, and more granular, video).

   RFC 4594 established a guideline for classifying the various flows 
   in the network and the Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP) 
   values that apply to many traffic types (table 3 of [RFC4594]), 
   including RTP based voice and video traffic sessions. The RFC also 
   defined the per hop network behavior that is strongly encouraged for
   each of these application traffic types based on the traffic 
   characteristics and tolerances to delay, loss and jitter within each
   traffic class. 

   Video was broken down into four categories in that RFC, and voice in 
   another single category.  We do not believe this satisfies the 


Polk, et al.              Expires Jan 4, 2015                  [Page 3]
Internet-Draft         SDP trafficclass Attribute             July 2014

   technical and business requirements to accomplish sufficiently 
   unique labeling of RTP traffic.

   If the application becomes aware of traffic labeling, 

   - this can be coded into layer 3 mechanisms.

   - this can be coded into layer 4 protocols and/or mechanisms.

   - this can be coded into a combination of mechanisms and protocols. 

   A lower layer mechanism for differentiating traffic is either the 
   port number or the Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP) value 
   [RFC2474]. Within the public Internet, if the application is not 
   part of a managed service, the DSCP value likely will be best effort 
   (BE), or reset to BE, at ingress to a provider's network. Within 
   the corporate LAN, this is usually completely configurable and a 
   local IT department can take full advantage of this labeling to 
   shape and manage their network as they see fit.  

   Within a network core, DiffServ typically does not apply. That said,
   DiffServ can be used to identify which traffic goes into which MPLS 
   tunnel [RFC4124].

   Labeling realtime traffic types using a layer 4 protocol would 
   likely involve RSVP [RFC2205] or NSIS [RFC4080]. RSVP has an 
   Application Identifier (app-ID) defined in [RFC2872] that provides a 
   means for carrying a traffic class label along the media path.  An 
   advantage of this mechanism is that the label can inform each domain 
   along the media path what type of traffic this traffic flow is, and 
   allow each domain to adjust the appropriate DSCP value (set by each 
   domain for use within that domain). Meaning, if a DSCP value is set 
   by an endpoint or a router in the first domain and gets reset by a 
   service provider, the far-end domain will be able to reset the DSCP 
   value appropriate for the intended traffic class. There is a 
   proposed extension to RSVP which creates individual profiles for 
   what goes into each app-ID field to describe these traffic classes 
   [ID-RSVP-PROF], which will take advantage of what is described in 
   this document.

   There are several proprietary mechanisms that can take advantage of 
   this labeling, but none of those will be discussed here.

   The idea of traffic - or service - identification is not new; it has
   been described in [RFC5897]. If that RFC is used as a guideline, 
   identification that leads to stream differentiation can be quite 
   useful.  One of the points within RFC 5897 is that users cannot be 
   allowed to assign any identification (fraud is one reason given). In
   addition, RFC 5897 recommends that service identification should be 
   done in signaling, rather than guessing or deep packet inspection. 
   Currently, any network would have to guess or perform deep 
   packet inspection to classify traffic and offer the service as per 


Polk, et al.              Expires Jan 4, 2015                  [Page 4]
Internet-Draft         SDP trafficclass Attribute             July 2014

   RFC 4594 as such service identification information is currently 
   not available in SDP and therefore to the network elements. Since 
   SDP understands how each stream is created (i.e., the particulars of
   the RTP stream), this is the right place to have this service 
   differentiated. Such service differentiation can then be 
   communicated to and leveraged by the network. 

   [Editor's Note: the words "traffic" and "service" are similar enough
                   that the above paragraph talks about RFC 5897's 
                   "service identification", but this document only 
                   discusses and proposes traffic indications in SDP.]

   This document proposes a simple attribute line to identify the 
   application a session is requesting in its offer/answer exchange.  
   This document uses previously defined service class strings for 
   consistency between IETF documents.

   This document utilizes the traffic classes originally created in RFC
   4594 in Section 2, enhancing each class with application identifiers 
   and optional adjective strings.  Section 3 defines the new SDP 
   attribute "trafficclass". Section 4 discusses the offerer and 
   answerer behavior when generating or receiving this attribute.

1.1 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Traffic Class Framework and Component Definitions

   The framework of the traffic class attribute will have at least two 
   parts, called components, allowing for several more to be included 
   further distinguishing a particular session's traffic classification
   from another session's traffic classification. The amount of 
   indicated differentiation between sessions is not a goal, and should
   only have additional components for differentiation if there is a 
   need to uniquely identify traffic in different sessions.

   The intention is to have a category component (e.g., conversational)
   that identifies the traffic pattern for a session. Is the traffic 
   within a session one-way or two-way? Can the traffic be buffered 
   before reaching the destination or not? What is this session's 
   tolerance to packet loss and can there be retransmissions?

   The application component (e.g., video) identifies the basic type of
   traffic within a category. Is it media or data packets? If media, 
   which type of media? If data packets, which application of data 
   packets are in this session?

   The optional adjective component(s) (e.g., immersive) help to 


Polk, et al.              Expires Jan 4, 2015                  [Page 5]
Internet-Draft         SDP trafficclass Attribute             July 2014

   further refine the traffic within a session by providing more 
   description. For instance, if a session is two-way voice, what 
   additional information can be given about this particular session to
   refine its description? Is it part of a conference or telepresence 
   session? Is it just standalone voice call? Has a capacity admission 
   protocol or mechanism been applied to this session?

   The 'traffic class label' (TCL) will have the following structure,

      category.application(.adjective)(.adjective)...

   [Editor's Note: the above is not the exact ABNF to be used.  
                   The order is right. The category and application 
                   MUST appear first (each only once) and zero or more 
                   adjectives can appear following the application 
                   component.]

   Where 
   1) the 1st component is the category, and is mandatory;
   2) the 2nd component is the application, and is mandatory;
   3) an optional 3rd component or series of components are 
      adjective(s) used to further refine the application component; 

   The construction of the traffic class label for Telepresence video 
   would follow the minimum form of:

      conversational.video.immersive 

   where there might be one or more adjective after '.immersive'.

   There is no traffic class or DSCP value associated with just 
   "conversational".  There is a traffic class associated with 
   "conversational.video", creating a differentiation between it and a 
   "conversational.video.immersive" traffic class, which would have 
   DSCP associated with the latter traffic class, depending on local 
   policy. Each category component is defined below, as are several of 
   application and adjective strings. This is shown in [ID-RSVP-PROF] 
   for the RSVP mapping of distinguishable traffic types.

   Mapping a specific Traffic Class Label to a DSCP value might be 
   accomplished in any of the following ways:

   o statically within the offerer and/or answerer; or

   o taken from a local mapping table/file, which might be downloaded 
     once, periodically or as changes in the network are observed; or

   o from feedback from the network.

3. Traffic Class Attribute Definition

   This document defines the 'trafficclass' media-level SDP attribute. 
   The following is the Augmented Backus-Naur Form  (ABNF) [RFC5234] 
   syntax for this attribute, which is based on the SDP [RFC4566] 
   grammar:

      attribute               =/ traffic-class-label
 
      traffic-class-label     = "trafficclass" ":" [SP] category
                                "." application *( "." adjective )
 
      category                = "broadcast" / 
                                "realtime-interactive" / 
                                "multimedia-conferencing" / 
                                "multimedia-streaming" / 
                                "conversational" / 
                                "intermittent / tcl-token
 
      application             = tcl-token
 
      adjective               = classified-adjective /
                                unclassified-adjective
 
      classified-adjective    = tcl-token ":" tcl-token
 
      unclassified-adjective  = tcl-token
 
      tcl-token               = ALPHA *( [ "-" ] ALPHA / DIGIT )

   A TCL "component" is any of the following:

   - category,
   - application, or 
   - adjective (which is the only optional component, and can have zero 
     or more of these type of components) 

   The attribute is named "trafficclass", for traffic classification, 
   identifying which one of the six categories applies to the 
   media stream associated with this m-line. There MUST NOT be more 
   than one category component per SDP media line. 

   The categories in this document are an augmented version of the 
   application labels introduced by table 3 of RFC 4594 (which will be 
   rewritten based on the updated labels and treatments expected for 
   each traffic class defined in this document).

       Figure 1. Label Differences from RFC 4594 

   As is evident from the changes above, from left to right, two labels
   are different and each of the meanings are different in this 
   document relative to how RFC 4594 defined them. These differences 
   are articulated in Section 4 of this document.

   Applications and adjectives are defined using the syntax of 
   "tcl-token" defined above. 

   RFC 4566 defined SDP as case sensitive. Everything is here as well.

   An algorithm such as alphabetizing the list of components and 
   matching the understood strings SHOULD be used for determining the 
   traffic within a session. Strings not understood by an entity MUST 
   be ignored during processing, but MUST NOT be deleted.

   Any category, application, or adjective string component within this
   attribute that is not understood MUST be ignored, leaving all that 
   is understood to be processed. Ignored components SHOULD NOT be 
   deleted, as a downstream entity could understand the component(s) 
   and use it/them during processing.

   The following is an example of media level description with a 
   'trafficclass' attribute:

      m=video 50000 RTP/AVP 112
      a=trafficclass:conversational.video.immersive.aq:admitted

   The above indicates the video part of a Telepresence session that 
   has had capacity admission process applied to its media flow.


3.1 Categories within the SDP Traffic Class Label

   The category component within the traffic class attribute describes 
   the type of communication that will occur within that session. It 
   answers these questions, is the traffic

   - one-way or two-or-more-way interactive?

   - buffered or (virtually) non-buffered?


Polk, et al.              Expires Jan 4, 2015                  [Page 8]
Internet-Draft         SDP trafficclass Attribute             July 2014


   - media or non-media (data)?

   The six category components of the traffic class attribute defined 
   within this specification are as follows:

   o conversational
   o multimedia-conferencing
   o realtime-interactive
   o multimedia-streaming
   o broadcast
   o intermittent

   Sections 4.1 through 4.6 define each of the above.

   The category component MUST NOT be the only component present in a 
   traffic class attribute. The category component MUST BE paired with 
   an 'application' component to give enough meaning to the traffic 
   class labeling goal.

   Not understanding the category component SHOULD mean that this 
   attribute is ignored, because of the information about the 
   expected behavior of this communication flow is identified by or 
   within that component.


3.2 Applications within the SDP Traffic Class Label

   The application component identifies the application of a particular
   traffic flow, for example, audio or video. The application types are
   listed and defined in Section 4 of this document. Not every category
   is paired with every application listed, at least as defined in this 
   document. One or more applications are inappropriate in one or more 
   categories.

   Section 4.1 through 4.6 list many of the expected combinations.


3.3 Adjectives within the SDP Traffic Class Label

   For additional application type granularity, adjective components 
   can be added. One or more adjectives can be within the same traffic 
   class attribute to provide more differentiation. 

   It is important to note that while the order of component types 
   matter, the order of the adjective components do not. In other 
   words, the category class component MUST be before the application 
   component, which MUST be before any and all adjective component(s).

   There is no limit to the number of adjectives allowed.

   Adjective components come in two versions, unqualified and 


Polk, et al.              Expires Jan 4, 2015                  [Page 9]
Internet-Draft         SDP trafficclass Attribute             July 2014

   qualified. One has a prefix (qualified), the other (unqualified) 
   does not. A defined qualified adjective MUST NOT appear without its 
   qualifier name, even in future extensions to this specification. 
   Some implementations will likely perform a search within this 
   attribute for the presence of qualifiers, which might be as simple 
   as searching for the ":" COLON character. Implementations will be 
   confused with inconsistent coding, therefore strict adherence is 
   necessary.


3.3.1 Qualified Adjectives

   Adjectives can be either unqualified or qualified. Qualified 
   adjectives have a delimiter ":" character between the "qualifier 
   name" and the "qualifier value".  As one example, we introduce in 
   this specification the "admission qualifier" and it has a qualifier 
   name of "aq".  We also define several possible qualifier values for 
   the admission qualifier, namely "admitted", "non-admitted", 
   "partial", and "none".  When present in a TCL component, the 
   qualified adjectives look like these admission qualifier adjectives:
      
      aq:admitted
      aq:non-admitted
      aq:partial
      aq:none

   Defining some adjectives as qualified adjectives allows entities 
   processing the traffic class label to potentially recognize a 
   particular qualifier name and act on it, even if it does not 
   understand the qualifier value.  In the future, a new admission 
   qualifier value might be defined, e.g. "foo", and entities could at 
   least recognize the admission qualifier adjective, even if it did 
   not understand the qualifier value "foo".

   Like all adjectives, it is OPTIONAL to include the admission 
   qualifier adjective in any trafficclass attribute.

  The admission qualifier and its qualifier values are defined as:

   - aq -       'admission qualifier' - this is the qualifier name for 
                the admission qualifier adjectives, wherein the 
                following qualifier values indicate the admission 
                status for the traffic flow described by this m-line.

4.  Matching Categories with Applications and Adjectives

   This section describes each component within this document, as well 
   as provides the combinations of categories and applications and 
   adjectives. Given that not every combination makes sense, we express
   the limits here - which will be IANA registered. The majority of 
   these TCLs in this document are found in [ID-RSVP-PROF], where RSVP 
   is appropriate. Look at that other document for example usage of a 
   specified TCL here.


4.1 Conversational Category Traffic Class

   The "conversational" traffic class is best suited for applications 
   that require very low delay variation and generally intended to 
   enable realtime, bi-directional person-to-person or 
   multi-directional via an MCU communication. Conversational flows are
   inelastic, and with few exceptions, use a UDP transport.

   The following application components are appropriate for use with 
   the Conversational category:

   o audio (voice) 

   o video 

   o multiplex (i.e., combined a/v streams) an application wherein 
        media of different forms (e.g., audio and video) is multiplexed
        within the same media flow.

   With adjective substrings to the above 

   immersive (TP) - An interactive audio-visual communications 
        experience between remote locations, where the users enjoy a 
        strong sense of realism and presence between all participants 
        by optimizing a variety of attributes such as audio and video 
        quality, eye contact, body language, spatial audio, 
        coordinated environments and natural image size.

   avconf - An interactive audio-visual communication experience 
        that is not immersive in nature, though can have a high 
        resolution video component.

4.2 Multimedia-Conferencing Category Traffic Class 

   The "multimedia-conferencing" traffic class is best suited for 
   applications that are generally intended for communication between 
   human users, but are less demanding in terms of delay, packet loss, 
   and jitter than what conversational applications require.  These 
   applications require low to medium delay and may have the ability to
   change encoding rate (rate adaptive) or transmit data at varying 
   rates. 

 +--------------------------------------------------------------------+

 +---------------+-------------------------------+------+------+------+

       Figure 4. Multimedia Conferencing Traffic Characteristics

   Multimedia-conferencing flows are not media flows which are 
   conversational in nature. Multimedia-conferencing flows are those 
   data flows that are typically transmitted in parallel to currently 
   active conversational media flows. For example, a two-way conference
   session in which the users share a presentation. The presentation  
   part of that conference call uses the Multimedia-conferencing 
   category, whereas the audio and any video uses the conversational 
   category indication.

   The following application components are appropriate for use 
   with the Multimedia-Conferencing category:

   o application-sharing (that webex does or protocols like T.128) - 
        An application that shares the output of one or more running 
        applications or the desktop on a host. This can utilize 
        vector graphics, raster graphics or video.

   o presentation-data - can be a series of still images; could be at a 
        rapid or busty rate, just not a continuous 24 fps or greater.

   o presentation-video - motion video that is transmitted and rendered 
        as part of a presentation.

   o presentation-audio - the audio that is transmitted and rendered as

        part of a presentation.

   o whiteboarding - an application enabling the exchange of graphical 
        information including images, pointers and filled and 
        unfilled parametric drawing elements (points, lines, 
        polygons and ellipses).

   o (RTP-based) file-transfer as defined in RFC 5547

   o instant messaging

4.3 Realtime-Interactive Category Traffic Class 

   The "Realtime-Interactive" traffic class is intended for interactive 
   variable rate inelastic applications that require low jitter and 
   loss and very low delay. Many of the applications that use the 
   Realtime-Interactive category use TCP or SCTP, even gaming, because 
   lost packets is information that is still required - therefore it is
   retransmitted.

   The following application components are appropriate for use with 
   the Realtime-Interactive category:

   o gaming - interactive player video games with other users on other 
        hosts (e.g., Doom)

   o remote-desktop - controlling a remote node with local peripherals 
        (i.e., monitor, keyboard and mouse)

   o telemetry - a communication that allows remote measurement and 
        reporting of information (e.g., post launch missile status or 
        energy monitoring)

   With adjective substrings to the above 

   o virtual - To be used with the remote-desktop application component
        specifically when the traffic is a virtual desktop similar to

        a computer application with no local storage.

       Figure 8. Multimedia Streaming Traffic Characteristics


   The following application components are appropriate for use with 
   the Multimedia-Streaming category:

   o audio (see Section 4.1)

   o video (see Section 4.1)

   o webcast - is a media file distributed over the Internet or 
            enterprise network using streaming media technology.

   o multiplex (see Section 4.1)

   The primary difference between the multimedia-streaming category and 
   the broadcast category is the length of time for buffering. Buffered 
   streaming of audio and/or video which is often initiated by HTTP, 
   and not SDP. Buffering here can be from many seconds to hours, and 
   is typically at the destination end (as opposed to Broadcast 
   buffering which is minimal at the destination). The buffering 
   aspect is what differentiates this category class from the broadcast 
   category  (which has minimal or no buffering).

4.5 Broadcast Category Traffic Class

   The "broadcast" traffic class is best suited for inelastic streaming
   media Applications, which might have a 'wardrobe malfunction' delay 
   at or near the source but not typically at the destination, that may
   be of constant or variable rate, requiring low jitter and very low 
   packet loss. 

   See Section 4.4 for the difference between Multimedia-Streaming and 
   Broadcast; it all has to do with buffering.

            without a significant delay, typically measured in 
            milliseconds to a few seconds only.

   o surveillance -  one way audio from a microphone or video from a 
            camera (e.g., observing a parking lot or building exit), 
            typically enabled for long periods of time, usually stored 
            at the destination.

4.6 Intermittent Category Traffic Class

   The "intermittent" traffic class is best suited for inconstant rate 
   applications such as those from a sensor device, where tolerance to 
   loss, delay and jitter is often medium to high in nature. This 
   category is not to be used for bulk file transfers, rather it can be
   sometimes bursty for brief periods of time, but then not produce 
   traffic for short or long (i.e., hours or days) durations. Nor is 
   this category to be used for any kind of regular paced rate of 
   transmission, no matter how long the interval.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | Traffic Class |                               |    Tolerance to    |
 |    Name       |  Traffic Characteristics      | Loss |Delay |Jitter|
 |===============+===============================+======+======+======|
 | intermittent  | Inconstant rate, infrequent   |Medium|Medium| High |
 |               | but sometimes bursty flows,   |- High|- High|      |
 |               | generally non-regular,        |      |      |      |
 |               | variable inter-packet         |      |      |      |

 +---------------+-------------------------------+------+------+------+

       Figure 12. Intermittent Traffic Characteristics

   The following application components are appropriate for use with 
   the Broadcast category:

   o text (i.e., text required by deaf users) a term for seemingly
        real-time transmission of text in a character-by-character 
        fashion, often as a text equivalent to voice-based 
        conversational services, without the timing constraints of 
        conversational text is defined in the ITU-T Framework for 
        multimedia services, Recommendation F.700 [RFC5194].

   o sensor - a flow containing information obtained from a sensor, 
     such as a temperature or motion sensor.

   With adjective substrings to the above:

   o there are no defined adjectives for the 'sensor' application at 
     this time. There are many examples one could think would be viable
     adjectives, such as light, motion, temperature, magnetic fields, 
     gravity, humidity, moisture, vibration, pressure, electrical 
     fields, and other physical aspects of the external environment 
     measured by the sensor.

5.  Offer/Answer Behavior

   Through the inclusion of the 'trafficclass' attribute, an 
   offer/answer exchange identifies the application type(s) for use by 
   the endpoints within the media streams of a session.  Signaling 
   elements can use this attribute to determine the acceptability 
   and/or treatment of that session through lower layers, communicating
   a desired treatment for a particular flow to endpoints using SDP, 
   interacting with network elements using some unspecified mechanism, 
   or having endpoints communicate with network elements using some 
   unspecified mechanism. 

   In order to understand the traffic class attribute, the SDP entity 
   MUST check several components within the Traffic Class Label. By 
   understand, we mean that the value of each component of the TCL is 
   recognized, i.e., both the category and application components 
   MUST be a recognized set for a TCL to be understood.  Adjectives 
   that are not recognized are simply ignored and MAY be discarded, 
   however many there are. Adjectives which are not understood SHOULD 
   NOT be discarded, as each/any adjective might be understood by some 
   or all other downstream nodes in the signaling path.

   The following pertains to both the receiver of an offer and receiver 
   of an answer when either or both contain a Traffic Class Label 
   attribute. 

   1 - can the receiver of the SDP containing a trafficclass attribute 
       successfully process the category component? 

       If not, the attribute SHOULD be ignored. 

       If yes, it checks the application component.

   2 - can the receiver of the SDP containing a trafficclass attribute 
       successfully process the application component?

       If not, the answerer needs to check if it has a local policy to 
       proceed without an application component. The default for this 
       situation is as if the category component was not understood, 
       meaning the attribute SHOULD be ignored.

       If yes, it checks to see if there are any adjective components 


Polk, et al.              Expires Jan 4, 2015                 [Page 20]
Internet-Draft         SDP trafficclass Attribute             July 2014

       present in this attribute to start its classification.

   3 - can the receiver of the SDP containing a trafficclass attribute 
       successfully process the adjective component or components if 
       any are present?

       If not present, process and match the trafficclass label value 
       as is.

       If yes, determine if there is more than one. Search for each 
       that is understood. Any adjectives not understood are to be 
       ignored, as if they are not present. Match all remaining 
       understood components according to local policy and process 
       attribute.


5.1 Offer Behavior

   Offerers include the 'trafficclass' attribute within a single string
   per m= line comprised of at least a category and application 
   component (see Section 4) to establish the non-generic 
   classification of the media stream between the answerer and the 
   offerer. The offerer can also include one or more adjective 
   components, which might be a combination of registered and private 
   adjectives to further refine the identification of what this 
   particular media stream is.  

   Session Border Controllers (SBC) at domain boundaries can change 
   this attribute through local policy.


5.2 Answer Behavior

   Upon receiving an offer containing a 'trafficclass' attribute, if 
   the offer is accepted - including the ability to process the 3 
   bulleted rules in Section 5.0, the answerer will use this attribute 
   to classify the media level traffic accordingly towards the offerer. 

   The answerer will answer the offer with its own 'trafficclass' 
   attribute, which will likely be the same value, although this is not
   mandatory (at this time). The Offerer will process the received 
   answer just as the answerer processed the offer. In other words, the
   processing steps and rules are identical for each end (see Section 
   5).

   An Answer MAY have a 'trafficclass' attribute when one was not in 
   the offer.  This will at least aid the local domain, and perhaps 
   each domain the session transits, to categorize and in some cases 
   group the media-types of this session.

6.  Security considerations

   The security considerations from RFC 4566 are also applicable, 
   particularly since intermediary devices might be able to look at an 
   m= line and determine, not only is it audio, but that it is 
   presentation-audio (i.e., 
   'multimedia-conferencing.presentation-audio') versus conversational 
   audio.

   RFC 5897 [RFC5897] discusses many of the pitfalls of service 
   classification, which is similar enough to this idea of traffic 
   classification to apply here as well.  That document highly 
   recommends the user not being able to set any classification.  
   Barring a hack within an endpoint (i.e., to intentionally 
   misclassifying (i.e., lying) about which classification an RTP 
   stream is), this document's solution makes the classification part 
   of the signaling between endpoints, which is recommended by RFC 
   5897.

Appendix - Changes from Previous Versions

A.1  From -04 to -05

   These are the following changes made between the WG -03 version and 
   the -04 version:

   - general clean-up of text.

   - added presentation-video and presentation-audio to the 
     multimedia-conferencing section.

   - brought forward the text describing how a SDP entity handles 
     receiving a session description containing the trafficclass 
     attribute to Section 5, from 5.2.

   - added RFC 5547 as a normative reference.

   - expended the security considerations section.


A.2  From -03 to -04

   These are the following changes made between the WG -03 version and 
   the -04 version:

   - minimal text changes.

   - introduced the "intermittent" category based on IETF86 feedback in
     the WG.


A.3  From -02 to -03

   These are the following changes made between the WG -02 version and 
   the -03 version:

   - Rearranged a fair amount of text

   - Separated and defined the components into separate subsections.

   - built 5 different tables, one per category, that lists within each
     category - what applications are appropriate as well as what 
     adjectives are appropriate for each application within that

     category.

   - added the 'partial' admission qualifier for those flows that have 
     only part of their respective flow admitted (i.e., CAC'd).

A.4  From -01 to -02

   These are the following changes made between the WG -01 version and 
   the -02 version:
   - converged the use of terms 'parent' and 'category' to just 
     'category' for consistency.

   - changed ABNF to reflect extensibility by not having applications 
     and adjectives named in the ABNF, rather have them merely IANA 
     registered.

   - merged the qualified and unqualified adjective sections into a 
     single section on adjectives, but allowing some to have a 
     preceding qualifier.

   - text clean-up


A.5  From -00 to -01

   These are the following changes made between the WG -00 version and 
   the -01 version:

   - removed the non-SDP applications Netflix and VOD

   - switched the adjective 'desktop' to 'avconf'

   - Labeled each of the figures.

   - clarified the differences between Multimedia-Streaming and 
     Broadcast category categories.

   - defined Video surveillance

   - added the concept of a 'qualified' adjective, and modified the 
     ABNF.

   - deleted the idea of a 'cac-class' as a separate component, and 
     made the equivalent a qualified adjective.

   - modified the answerer behavior because of the removal of the 
     'cac-class' component.

   - created an IANA registry for qualified adjectives

   - general clean-up of the doc.
