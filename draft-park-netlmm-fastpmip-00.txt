Abstract

   Proxy mobile ipv6 (PMIPv6) is designed to manage mobility of hosts
   that are not equipped with any mobility management protocol. But
   PMIPv6 has a handover latency because it is based on global mobility
   management protocols such as MIPv6. Handover latency sensitives
   impact on real-time application. This document describes Fast and
   Local Proxy Mobile IPv6 (FLPMIPv6) to reduce handover latency and
   packet loss ratio. The scheme is based on the fast mobile IP scheme
   and utilized some of messages defined in 802.21 and information
   coming from link layer.

1. Introduction

   PMIPv6[1] is designed to avoid tunneling overhead over the air and to
   manage mobility of hosts that are not equipped with any mobility
   management software. However PMIPv6 leads to increasing signaling
   cost as mobile nodes move frequently because the protocol is based on
   the global mobility management protocol. In addition, handoff latency
   and packet loss incured when MN moves to a different PMA.  Under the
   respect, we propose a mobility management scheme called Fast and
   Localized proxy Mobile IPv6 (FLPMIPv6) to reduce handover latency and
   ration of pakcet loss. We utilize the fast mobile IP scheme specified
   in [2] and information generated by link layer following to the
   802.21 specification [3].


2. Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   The basic terminology defined in [1],[2] is used in this document. In
   addition, the following terminology is used.

      It is used for the MN's default router prior to its handover.

   New Proxy Mobile Agent (NPMA)

      It is used for the MN's default router subsequent to its handover.

3. Protocol Details

   The FLPMIPv6 protocol starts off by the time when a mobile node moves
   to a NPMA. FLPMIPv6 supports predictive handover that operates FLP-
   MIPv6 handover procedures prior to the finalizing handover procedures
   at layer 2. Figure 2 shows the Fast Localized PMIPv6 handover proce-
   dure.

               Figure 2: Fast Localized PMIPv6 handover procedure

   The procedure is as follows.

   1. Media Independent Handover Function (MIHF) of MN recives Link
   Going Down (LGD) indication from MIHF.

   2. The MN's MIHF sends Media Independent Handover Handoff Initiate
   (MIH HO Init) command message to current PPMA. This message contains
   new PMA (NPMA)'s [AR-ID, AR-Info] tuples.

   3. After the PPMA recives MIH HO Init, the PPMA sends Handover

   Initiate (HI) message to NPMA where the HI message contains the MN's
   IP address (PCoA) and MN's identifier.

   The NPMA recives HI message, it SHOULD examine whether a tunnel to
   the LMA exists for PCoA or not. If the tunnel has been already estab-
   lished, it could mean one of two thing. The HI message from PPMA is,
   on one hand, spurious and NPMA had already setup a tunnel with LMA
   when it saw the L2 trigger earlier. On the other hand, it could also
   mean that there is already a node with the same PCoA address on the
   link.

   The NPMA verifies the MN's identifier to see whether it is the same
   node or not. If it is the same node, it returns failure indicating
   Duplicate Address. If NPMA successfully processes the HI message, it
   sends a Fast Binding Update message to the LMA to redirect the tunnel
   from the PPMA. The FBU message contains PCoA as the home address as
   well as it can optionally include the MN's unique identifier.

   4. When LMA receives the FBU message, it examine whether or not there
   is a binding for the RCoA. If it does not exist, it creates a new
   binding entry. Otherwise, it examine if the MN's identifier in the
   FBU matches with the identifier in the binding. If it matches, then
   it updates the binding information. Otherwise, it fails the request.

   Once the LMA successfully processes the FBU, it sets (or updates) the
   tunnel to NPMA for sending and receiving packets from PCoA. Normally
   a host route will be added for PCoA pointing to the tunnel. If suc-
   cessful updates MN's RCoA then the LMA sends FBack mesage to NPMA.

   5. When the NPMA receives a successful FBack message, it examine
   whether or not the FBU was processed successfully. If there is a
   failure, the HAck messagge indicates the failure. Otherwise, it cre-
   ates a tunnel to the LMA and sets up the forwarding in such a way
   where packets with source address as PCoA get forwarded into the tun-
   nel. It also maintains state, like the binding state, which can be
   used to verify duplication or spurious indications from PPMA or MN.

   It also creates a host route for forwarding packets to the MN. The
   NPMA sends a HAck message back to the PPMA indicating that it was
   successfully done the handover procedure.

   6. When PPMA receives the HAck message, it forwards packet to NPMA.

Internet-Draft                  FLPMIPv6                   February 2007


   When NPMA receves the tunneled MN's packet from PPMA then starts
   packet buffering.

   7. When the MN connects to the new link, MN's MIHF recives Link
   UP(LGD) indication from MIHF. The MN sends MIH HO Com message to
   NPMA.

   8. The NPMA recives MIH HO Com. The NPMA can use this indication to
   start forwarding packets to the MN, thereafter it forwards the
   buffered packets.


4. Message Formats

   All the messages between PPMA and NPMA are ICMPv6 mesages. This docu-
   ment initially follows the format defined in [2],[3]

5. Security Considerations

   This document does not discuss any special security concerns in
   detail.  The protocol of this document is built on the assumption
   that all participating nodes are trusted each other as well as there
   is no adversary who modifies/injects false messages to corrupt the
   procedures.

   However, support of secure transaction is prerequisite for launching
   a secure communication in the presence of adversaries.  In such an
   environment, most of all mobility management protocols including
   PMIPv6 may be vulnerable to many kinds of attacks.  It is fairly easy
   to inject fake messages or modify legitimate ones so that network
   operation would be heavily disturbed.  Therefore, it is necessary to
   find a means to authenticate/verify signaling messages for IP han-
   dover.
