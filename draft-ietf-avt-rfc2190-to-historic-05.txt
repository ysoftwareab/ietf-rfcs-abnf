1.  Introduction

   The ITU-T recommendation H.263 [H263] specifies the encoding used by
   ITU-T compliant video-conference codecs.  The first version (version
   1) was approved in 1996 by the ITU and a payload format for
   encapsulating this H.263 bitstream in the Real-Time Transport
   Protocol (RTP) is in RFC-2190 [RFC2190].  In 1998 the ITU approved a
   new version of H.263 [H263P] that is also known as H.263 plus.  This
   version added optional features and a new payload format is now in
   RFC-2429 [RFC2429].  RFC-2429 is capable of carrying encoded video
   bit streams that are using only the basic H.263 version 1 options.

   RFC-2429 [RFC2429] states that it does not replace RFC-2190, which
   continues to be used by existing implementations, and may be required
   for backward compatibility in new implementations.  Implementations
   using the new features of the 1998 version of H.263 shall use the
   format described in RFC-2429.

   RFC-2429 is now being revised and will now include a language that
   will make it clear that all new implementations MUST use RFC2429-bis
   [rfc2429bis] for encoding of any version of H.263.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant RTP implementations.

3.  Recommendation

   RFC-2429 and the rfc2429-bis draft [rfc2429bis] can be used to carry
   new H.263 payload even if they are using only the features defined in
   the 1996 version.  All the H.263 features that are part of the 1996
   version are also part of the 1998 version.

   It is recommended that RFC-2190 will be moved to historic status and
   that as stated in draft rfc2429-bis [rfc2429bis] new implementations
   will use the revised draft rfc2429bis and the H263-1998 and H263-2000
   MIME subtypes.

4.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations with this specification.

5.  Security Considerations

   Security consideration for H263 video RTP payload can be found in the
   draft rfc2429-bis [rfc2429bis].  Using the payload specification in
   draft rfc2429-bis instead of RFC2190 does not affect the security
   consideration since both of them refer to RFC3550 [RFC3550] and
   RFC3551 [RFC3551] for security considerations.
