      Alternative Network Deployments: Taxonomy, characterization,
                     technologies and architectures
           draft-irtf-gaia-alternative-network-deployments-03

Abstract

   This document presents a taxonomy of "Alternative Network
   Deployments", and a set of definitions and shared properties.  It
   also surveys the technologies employed in these networks, and their
   differing architectural characteristics.

   The term "Alternative Network Deployments" includes a set of network
   access models that have emerged in the last decade.  These networks
   aim to bring Internet connectivity to people, using topological,
   architectural and business models different from the so-called
   "traditional" ones, where a company deploys or leases the network
   infrastructure for connecting the users, who pay a subscription fee
   to be connected and make use of it.

   Several initiatives throughout the world have built large scale
   Alternative Networks, using predominantly wireless technologies
   (including long distance) due to the reduced cost of using unlicensed
   spectrum.  Wired technologies such as fiber are also used in some of
   these alternate networks.

   The emergence of these networks has been motivated by a variety of
   factors such as the reluctance of network operators to provide wired
   and cellular infrastructures to rural/remote areas.  In these cases,
   the networks have self-sustaining business models that provide more
   localized communication services as well as Internet backhaul support
   through peering agreements with traditional network operators.  In
   other cases, networks are built as a complement to commercial
   Internet access provided by "traditional" network operators.

   The present classification considers extant network models such as
   Community Networks, which are self-organized and decentralized
   networks wholly owned by the community; networks owned by individuals
   who act as Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs); networks
   owned by individuals but leased out to network operators who use them
   as a low-cost medium to reach the underserved population, and finally
   there are networks that provide connectivity by sharing wireless
   resources of the users.

   Different criteria are used in order to build a classification e.g.,
   the ownership of the equipment, the way the network is organized, the
   participatory model, the extensibility, if they are driven by a
   community, a company or a local stakeholder (public or private), etc.

   According to the developed taxonomy, a characterization of each kind
   of network is presented in terms of specific network characteristics
   related to architecture, organization, etc.

1.  Introduction

   Several initiatives throughout the world have built large scale
   networks, using predominantly wireless technologies (including long
   distance) due to the reduced cost of using unlicensed spectrum.
   Wired technologies such as fiber are also used in some of these
   alternate networks.  These networks constitute an alternative to
   traditional network operator deployments.

   There are several types of alternate deployments: Community Networks
   are self-organized and decentralized networks wholly owned by the
   community; networks owned by individuals who act as Wireless Internet
   Service Providers (WISPs); networks owned by individuals but leased
   out to network operators who use such networks as a low cost medium
   to reach the underserved population, and finally there are networks
   that provide connectivity by sharing wireless resources of the users.

   The emergence of these networks has been motivated by a variety of
   factors such as the reluctance of network operators to provide wired
   and cellular infrastructures to rural/remote areas [Pietrosemoli].
   In these cases, the networks have self-sustaining business models
   that provide more localized communication services as well as
   Internet backhaul support through peering agreements with traditional
   network operators.  In other cases, they are built as a complement
   and an alternative to commercial Internet access provided by
   "traditional" network operators.

   One of the aims of the Global Access to the Internet for All (GAIA)
   IRTF research group is "to document and share deployment experiences
   and research results to the wider community through scholarly
   publications, white papers, Informational and Experimental RFCs,
   etc."  In line with this objective, this document proposes a
   classification of these "Alternative Network Deployments".  This term
   includes a set of network access models that have emerged in the last
   decade with the aim of bringing Internet connectivity to people,
   following topological, architectural and business models that differ
   from the so-called "traditional" ones, where a company deploys the
   infrastructure connecting the users, who pay a subscription fee to be
   connected and make use of it.  The present document is intended to
   provide a broad overview of initiatives, technologies and approaches

   employed in these networks.  References describing each kind of
   network are also provided.

1.1.  Traditional networks

   In this document we will use the term "traditional networks" to
   denote those sharing these characteristics:

   - Regarding scale, they are usually large networks spanning entire
   regions.

   - Top-down control of the network and centralized approaches are
   used.

   - They require a substantial investment in infrastructure.

   - Users in traditional networks tend to be passive consumers, as
   opposed to active stakeholders, in the network design, deployment,
   operation and maintenance.

1.2.  Alternative Networks

   The definition of an "alternative network" in this document is
   negative: a network that does not have the characteristics of
   "traditional networks".

2.  General Considerations Regarding Alternative Networks

   Alternative Network Deployments are present in every part of the
   world.  Even in some high-income countries, these networks have been
   built as an alternative to commercial ones managed by traditional
   network operators.  This section discusses the scenarios where
   Alternative Networks are deployed.

2.1.  Digital Divide and Alternative Networks

   Although there is no consensus on a precise definition for the term
   "developing country", it is generally used to refer to nations with a
   relatively lower standard of living.  Developing countries have also
   been defined as those which are in transition from traditional
   lifestyles towards the modern lifestyle which began in the Industrial
   Revolution.  When it comes to quantify to which extent a country is a
   developing country, the Human Development Index has been proposed by
   the United Nations in order to consider the Gross National Income
   (GNI), the life expectancy and the education level of the population
   in a single indicator.  Additionally, the Gini Index (World Bank
   estimate) may be used to measure the inequality, as it estimates the




Saldana, et al.           Expires July 17, 2016                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       Alternative Network Deployments        January 2016


   dispersion of the national income (see
   http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI).

   However, at the beginning of the 90's the debates about how to
   quantify development in a country were shaken by the appearance of
   Internet and mobile phones, which many authors consider the beginning
   of the Information Society.  With the beginning of this Digital
   Revolution, defining development based on Industrial Society concepts
   started to be challenged, and links between digital development and
   its impact on human development started to flourish.  The following
   dimensions are considered to be meaningful when measuring the digital
   development state of a country: infrastructures (availability and
   affordability); ICT (Information and Communications Technology)
   sector (human capital and technological industry); digital literacy;
   legal and regulatory framework; and content and services.  A lack of
   digital development in one or more of these dimensions is what has
   been referred as the Digital Divide.  This divide is a new vector of
   inequality which - as occurred during the Industrial Revolution - may
   generate progress, but may create economic poverty and exclusion at
   the same time.  The Digital Divide is considered to be a consequence
   of other socio-economic divides, while, at the same time, a reason
   for their rise.

   In this context, the so-called "developing countries", in order not
   to be left behind by this incipient digital revolution, motivated the
   World Summit of the Information Society, which aimed at achieving "a
   people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information
   Society, where everyone can create, access, utilize and share
   information and knowledge, enabling individuals, communities and
   peoples to achieve their full potential in promoting their
   sustainable development and improving their quality of life" [WSIS],
   and called upon "governments, private sector, civil society and
   international organizations" to actively engage to accomplish it
   [WSIS].

   Most efforts from governments and international organizations
   initially focused on improving and extending the existing
   infrastructure in order not to leave their population behind.  As an
   example, one of the goals of the Digital Agenda for Europe [DAE] is
   "to increase regular internet usage from 60% to 75% by 2015, and from
   41% to 60% among disadvantaged people."

   Universal Access and Service plans have taken different forms in
   different countries over the years, with very uneven success rates,
   but in most cases inadequate to the scale of the problem.  Given this
   incapacity to solve the problem, some governments included Universal
   Service and Access obligations on mobile network operators when
   liberalizing the telecommunications market.  In combination with the



Saldana, et al.           Expires July 17, 2016                 [Page 6]

   overwhelming and unexpected uptake of mobile phones by poor people,
   this has mitigated the low access indicators existing in many
   developing countries at the beginning of the 90s [Rendon].

   Although the contribution made by mobile network operators in
   decreasing the access gap is undeniable, their model presents some
   constraints that limit the development outcomes that increased
   connectivity promises to bring.  Prices, tailored for the more
   affluent part of the population, remain unaffordable to many, who
   invest large percentages of their disposable income in
   communications.  Additionally, the cost of prepaid packages, the only
   option available for the informal economies existing throughout
   developing countries, is high compared with the rate longer-term
   subscribers pay.

   The consolidation of many Alternative Networks (e.g.  Community
   Networks) in high income countries sets a precedent for civil society
   members from the so-called developing countries to become more active
   in the search for alternatives to provide themselves with affordable
   access.  Furthermore, Alternative Networks could contribute to other
   dimensions of the digital development like increased human capital
   and the creation of content and services targeting the locality of
   each network.

2.2.  Urban vs. Rural Areas

   The Digital Divide presented in the previous section is not only
   present between countries, but within them too.  This is especially
   the case for rural inhabitants, who represent approximately 55% of
   the world's population, 78% of them in developing countries.
   Although it is impossible to generalize among them, there exist some
   common features that have determined the availability of ICT
   infrastructure in these regions.  The disposable income of rural
   dwellers is lower than those inhabiting urban areas, with many
   surviving on a subsistence economy.  Many of them are located in
   geographies difficult to access and exposed to extreme weather
   conditions.  This has resulted in the almost complete lack of
   electrical infrastructure.  This context, together with relatively
   low population density, discourages telecommunications operators from
   providing similar services to those provided to urban dwellers, since
   they do not deem them profitable.

   The cost of the wireless infrastructure required to set up a network,
   including powering it (e.g. via solar energy), is within the range of
   affordability, if not of individuals then at least of entire
   communities.  The social capital existing in these areas can allow
   for Alternative Network set-ups where a reduced number of nodes may
   cover communities whose dwellers share the cost of the infrastructure



Saldana, et al.           Expires July 17, 2016                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       Alternative Network Deployments        January 2016


   and the gateway and access it via inexpensive wireless devices.  Some
   examples are presented in [Pietrosemoli] and [Bernardi].

   In this case, the lack of awareness and confidence of rural
   communities to embark on such tasks by themselves can become major
   barriers to their deployment.  Scarce technical skills in these
   regions have also been identified as a challenge to their success.
   However, the proliferation of urban Community Networks, where
   scarcity of spectrum, scale, and heterogeneity of devices pose
   tremendous challenges to their stability and the services they aim to
   provide, has fuelled the creation of robust low-cost, low-
   consumption, low-complexity off-the-shelf wireless devices.  These
   devices can simplify the deployment and maintenance of alternative
   infrastructures in rural areas.

2.3.  Gap between Demand and Provision of Communications Services

   Beyond the Digital Divide, either international or domestic, there
   are many situations in which the market fails to provide the
   information and communications services demanded by the population.
   When this happens permanently in an area, citizens may be compelled
   to take a more active part in the design and implementation of ICT
   solutions, hence promoting Alternative Networks.

2.4.  Topology patterns followed by Alternative Networks

   Alternative Networks, considered self-managed and self-sustained,
   follow different topology patterns [Vega].  Generally, these networks
   grow spontaneously and organically, that is, the network grows
   without specific planning and deployment strategy and the routing
   core of the network tends to fit a power law distribution.  Moreover,
   these networks are composed of a high number of heterogeneous devices
   with the common objective of freely connecting and increasing the
   network coverage.  Although these characteristics increase the
   entropy (e.g., by increasing the number of routing protocols), they
   have resulted in an inexpensive solution to effectively increase the
   network size.  One example corresponds to Guifi.net [Vega] with an
   exponential growth rate in the number of operating nodes during the
   last decade.

   Regularly, rural areas in these networks are connected through long-
   distance links (the so-called community mesh approach) which in turn
   conveys the Internet connection to relevant organizations or
   institutions.  In contrast, in urban areas, users tend to share and
   require mobile access.  Since these areas are also likely to be
   covered by commercial ISPs, the provision of wireless access by
   Virtual Operators like [Fon] may constitute a way to extend the user

Internet-Draft       Alternative Network Deployments        January 2016


   capacity to the network.  Other proposals like Virtual Public
   Networks [Sathiaseelan_a] can also extend the service.

3.  Classification criteria

   The classification of Alternative Network Deployments, presented in
   this document, is based on the following criteria:

3.1.  Commercial model / promoter

   The entity (or entities) or individuals promoting an Alternative
   Network can be:

   o  A community of users.

   o  A public stakeholder.

   o  A private company.

   o  Supporters of a crowdshared approach.

   o  A community that already owns some infrastructure shares it with
      an operator, which uses it for backhauling purposes.

   o  A research or academic entity.

3.2.  Goals and motivation

   Alternative networks can also be classified according to the
   underlying motivation for them, e.g., addressing deployment and usage
   hurdles:

   o  Reducing initial capital expenditures (for the network and the end
      user, or both).

   o  Providing additional sources of capital (beyond the traditional
      carrier-based financing).

   o  Reducing on-going operational costs (such as backhaul or network
      administration)

   o  Leveraging expertise.

   o  Reducing hurdles to adoption (digital literacy; literacy in
      general; relevance, etc.)

   o  Extending coverage to underserved areas (users and communities).

   o  Network neutrality guarantees.

3.3.  Administrative model

   o  Centralized.

   o  Distributed.

3.4.  Technologies employed

   o  Standard Wi-Fi.

   o  Wi-Fi modified for long distances (WiLD), either with CSMA/CA or
      with an alternative TDMA MAC [Simo_b].

   o  802.16-compliant systems over non-licensed bands.

   o  Dynamic Spectrum Solutions (e.g. based on the use of white
      spaces).

   o  Satellite solutions.

   o  Low-cost optical fiber systems.

3.5.  Typical scenarios

   The scenarios where Alternative Networks are usually deployed can be:

   o  Urban.

   o  Rural.

   o  Rural in developing countries.

4.  Classification of Alternative Networks

   This section classifies Alternative Networks according to the
   criteria explained previously.  Each of them has different incentive
   structures, maybe common technological challenges, but most
   importantly interesting usage challenges which feed into the
   incentives as well as the technological challenges.

   At the beginning of each subsection, a table is presented including a
   classification of each network according to the criteria listed in
   the "Classification criteria" subsection.

   In some cases, real examples of Alternative Networks are cited.

           Table 1: Community Networks' characteristics summary

   Community Networks are large-scale, distributed, self-managed
   networks sharing these characteristics:

   - They are built and organized in a decentralized and open manner.

   - They start and grow organically, they are open to participation
   from everyone, sometimes sharing an open peering agreement.
   Community members directly contribute active (not just passive)
   network infrastructure.

   - Knowledge about building and maintaining the network and ownership
   of the network itself is decentralized and open.  Community members
   have an obvious and direct form of organizational control over the
   overall operation of the network in their community (not just their
   own participation in the network).

   - The network can serve as a backhaul for providing a whole range of
   services and applications, from completely free to even commercial
   services.

   Hardware and software used in Community Networks can be very diverse,
   even inside one network.  A Community Network can have both wired and
   wireless links.  Multiple routing protocols or network topology
   management systems may coexist in the network.

   These networks grow organically, since they are formed by the
   aggregation of nodes belonging to different users.  A minimal
   governance infrastructure is required in order to coordinate IP
   addressing, routing, etc.  An example of this kind of Community
   Network is described in [Braem].  These networks follow a

   participatory model, which has been shown effective in connecting
   geographically dispersed people, thus enhancing and extending digital
   Internet rights.

   The fact of the users adding new infrastructure (i.e. extensibility)
   can be used to formulate another definition: A Community Network is a
   network in which any participant in the system may add link segments
   to the network in such a way that the new segments can support
   multiple nodes and adopt the same overall characteristics as those of
   the joined network, including the capacity to further extend the
   network.  Once these link segments are joined to the network, there
   is no longer a meaningful distinction between the previous and the
   new extent of the network.

   In Community Networks, profit can only be made by offering services
   and not simply by supplying the infrastructure, because the
   infrastructure is neutral, free, and open (traditional Internet
   Service Providers base their business on the control of the
   infrastructure).  In Community Networks, everybody keeps the
   ownership of what he/she has contributed.

   Community Networks may also be called "Free Networks" or even
   "Network Commons" [FNF].  The majority of Community Networks comply
   with the definition of Free Network, included in the next subsection.

4.1.1.  Free Networks

   A definition of Free Network (which may be the same as Community
   Network) is proposed by the Free Network Foundation (see
   https://thefnf.org) as:

   "A free network equitably grants the following freedoms to all:

   Freedom 0 - The freedom to communicate for any purpose, without
   discrimination, interference, or interception.

   Freedom 1 - The freedom to grow, improve, communicate across, and
   connect to the whole network.

   Freedom 2- The freedom to study, use, remix, and share any network
   communication mechanisms, in their most reusable forms."

   The principles of Free, Open and Neutral Networks have also been
   summarized (see https://guifi.net/en/FONNC) this way:

   "- You have the freedom to use the network for any purpose as long as
   you do not harm the operation of the network itself, the rights of




Saldana, et al.           Expires July 17, 2016                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft       Alternative Network Deployments        January 2016


   other users, or the principles of neutrality that allow contents and
   services to flow without deliberate interference.

   - You have the right to understand the network, to know its
   components, and to spread knowledge of its mechanisms and principles.

   - You have the right to offer services and content to the network on
   your own terms.

   - You have the right to join the network, and the responsibility to
   extend this set of rights to anyone according to these same terms."

                  Table 2: WISPs' characteristics summary

   WISPs are commercially-operated wireless Internet networks that
   provide Internet and/or Voice Over Internet (VoIP) services.  They
   are most common in areas not covered by traditional telcos or ISPs.
   WISPs mostly use wireless point-to-multipoint links using unlicensed
   spectrum but often must resort to licensed frequencies.  Use of
   licensed frequencies is common in regions where unlicensed spectrum
   is either perceived to be crowded, or too unreliable to offer
   commercial services, or where unlicensed spectrum faces regulatory
   barriers impeding its use.

   Most WISPs are operated by local companies responding to a perceived
   market gap.  There is a small but growing number of WISPs, such as
   AirJaldi [Airjaldi] in India that have expanded from local service
   into multiple locations.

   Since 2006, the deployment of cloud-managed WISPs has been possible
   with hardware from companies such as Meraki and later OpenMesh and
   others.  Until recently, however, most of these services have been

   aimed at industrialized markets.  Everylayer [Everylayer], launched
   in 2014, is the first cloud-managed WISP service aimed at emerging
   markets.

   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+

          Table 3: Shared infrastructure characteristics summary

   In conventional networks, the operator usually owns the
   telecommunications infrastructure required for the service, or
   sometimes rents infrastructure to/from other companies.  The problem
   arises in large areas with low population density, in which neither
   the operator nor other companies have deployed infrastructure and
   such deployments are not likely to happen due to the low potential
   return on investment.

   When users already own deployed infrastructure, either individually
   or as a community, sharing that infrastructure with an operator can
   benefit both parties and is a solution that has been deployed in some
   areas.  For the operator, this provides a significant reduction in
   the initial investment needed to provide services in small rural
   localities because capital expenditure is only associated with the
   access network.  Renting capacity in the users' network for
   backhauling only requires an increment in the operating expenditure.
   This approach also benefits the users in two ways: they obtain
   improved access to telecommunications services that would not be
   accessible otherwise, and they can derive some income from the
   operator that helps to offset the network's operating costs,
   particularly for network maintenance.

   One clear example of the potential of the "shared infrastructure
   model" nowadays is the deployment of 3G services in rural areas in
   which there is a broadband rural community network.  Since the
   inception of femtocells, there are complete technical solutions for
   low-cost 3G coverage using the Internet as a backhaul.  If a user or
   community of users has an IP network connected to the Internet with
   some excess capacity, placing a femtocell in the user premises
   benefits both the user and the operator, as the user obtains better
   coverage and the operator does not have to support the cost of the
   backhaul infrastructure.  Although this paradigm was conceived for
   improved indoor coverage, the solution is feasible for 3G coverage in
   underserved rural areas with low population density (i.e. villages),
   where the number of simultaneous users and the servicing area are
   small enough to use low-cost femtocells.  Also, the amount of traffic
   produced by these cells can be easily transported by most community
   broadband rural networks.

   Some real examples can be referenced in the TUCAN3G project, (see
   http://www.ict-tucan3g.eu/) which deployed demonstrator networks in
   two regions in the Amazon forest in Peru.  In these networks
   [Simo_a], the operator and several rural communities cooperated to
   provide services through rural networks built up with WiLD links
   [WiLD].  In these cases, the networks belong to the public health
   authorities and were deployed with funds come from international
   cooperation for telemedicine purposes.  Publications that justify the
   feasibility of this approach can also be found on that website.

4.4.  Crowdshared approaches, led by the users and third party
      stakeholders

   +-----------------------+-------------------------------------------+

          Table 4: Crowdshared approaches characteristics summary

   These networks can be defined as a set of nodes whose owners share
   common interests (e.g. sharing connectivity; resources; peripherals)
   regardless of their physical location.  They conform to the following



Saldana, et al.           Expires July 17, 2016                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft       Alternative Network Deployments        January 2016


   approach: the home router creates two wireless networks: one of them
   is normally used by the owner, and the other one is public.  A small
   fraction of the bandwidth is allocated to the public network, to be
   employed by any user of the service in the immediate area.  Some
   examples are described in [PAWS] and [Sathiaseelan_c].  Other
   examples are found in the networks created and managed by City
   Councils (e.g., [Heer]).

   In the same way, some companies [Fon] develop and sell Wi-Fi routers
   with dual access: a Wi-Fi network for the user, and a shared one.  A
   user community is created, and people can join the network in
   different ways: they can buy a router, so they share their connection
   and in turn they get access to all the routers associated with the
   community.  Some users can even get some revenue every time another
   user connects to their Wi-Fi access point.  Users that are not part
   of the community can buy passes in order to use the network.  In some
   cases traditional telecommunications operators collaborate with these
   communities, by including the functionality required to create the
   two access networks in their routers.

   The elements involved in a crowd-shared network are summarized below:

   - Interest: a parameter capable of providing a measure (cost) of the
   attractiveness of a node in a specific location, at a specific
   instance in time.

   - Resources: A physical or virtual element of a global system.  For
   instance, bandwidth; energy; data; devices.

   - The owner: End users who sign up for the service and share their
   network capacity.  As a counterpart, they can access another owners'
   home network capacity for free.  The owner can be an end user or an
   entity (e.g. operator; virtual operator; municipality) that is to be
   made responsible for any actions concerning his/her device.

   - The user: a legal entity or an individual using or requesting a
   publicly available electronic communications' service for private or
   business purposes, without necessarily having subscribed to such
   service.

   - The Virtual Network Operator (VNO): An entity that acts in some
   aspects as a network coordinator.  It may provide services such as
   initial authentication or registration, and eventually, trust
   relationship storage.  A VNO is not an ISP given that it does not
   provide Internet access (e.g. infrastructure; naming).  A VNO is not
   an Application Service Provider (ASP) either since it does not
   provide user services.  Virtual Operators may also be stakeholders
   with socio-environmental objectives.  They can be local governments,

   grass-roots user communities, charities, or even content operators,
   smart grid operators, etc.  They are the ones who actually run the
   service.

   - Network operators, who have a financial incentive to lease out
   unused capacity [Sathiaseelan_b] at lower cost to the VNOs.

   VNOs pay the sharers and the network operators, thus creating an
   incentive structure for all the actors: the end users get money for
   sharing their network, the network operators are paid by the VNOs,
   who in turn accomplish their socio-environmental role.

   +--------------------+----------------------------------------------+

                Table 5: Testbeds' characteristics summary

   In some cases, the initiative to start the network is not from the
   community, but from a research entity (e.g. a university), with the
   aim of using it for research purposes [Samanta], [Bernardi].

   The administration of these networks may start being centralized in
   most cases (administered by the academic entity) and may end up in a
   distributed model in which other local stakeholders assume part of
   the network administration [Rey].

5.  Technologies employed

5.1.  Wired

   In many (developed or developing) countries it may happen that
   national service providers decline to provide connectivity to tiny
   and isolated villages.  So in some cases the villagers have created




Saldana, et al.           Expires July 17, 2016                [Page 17]

   their own optical fiber networks.  This is the case in Lowenstedt in
   Germany [Lowenstedt], or some parts of Guifi.net [Cerda-Alabern].

5.2.  Wireless

   The vast majority of Alternative Network Deployments are based on
   different wireless technologies [WNDW].  Below we summarize the
   options and trends when using these features in Alternative Networks.

5.2.1.  Media Access Control (MAC) Protocols for Wireless Links

   Different protocols for Media Access Control, which also include
   physical layer (PHY) recommendations, are widely used in Alternative
   Network Deployments.  Wireless standards ensure interoperability and
   usability to those who design, deploy and manage wireless networks.

   The standards used in the vast majority of Alternative Networks come
   from the IEEE Standard Association's IEEE 802 Working Group.
   Standards developed by other international entities can also be used,
   as e.g. the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).

5.2.1.1.  802.11 (Wi-Fi)

   The standard we are most interested in is 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, as it
   defines the protocol for Wireless LAN.  It is also known as "Wi-Fi".
   The original release (a/b) was issued in 1999 and allowed for rates
   up to 54 Mbit/s.  The latest release (802.11ac) approved in 2013
   reaches up to 866.7 Mbit/s.  In 2012, the IEEE issued the 802.11-2012
   Standard that consolidates all the previous amendments.  The document
   is freely downloadable from IEEE Standards [IEEE].

   The MAC protocol in 802.11 is called CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple
   Access with Collision Avoidance) and was designed for short
   distances; the transmitter expects the reception of an acknowledgment
   for each transmitted unicast packet; if a certain waiting time is
   exceeded, the packet is retransmitted.  This behavior makes necessary
   the adaptation of several MAC parameters when 802.11 is used in long
   links [Simo_b].  Even with this adaptation, distance has a
   significant negative impact on performance.  For this reason, many
   vendors implement alternative medium access techniques that are
   offered alongside the standard CSMA/CA in their outdoor 802.11
   products.  These alternative proprietary MAC protocols usually employ
   some type of TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access).  Low cost
   equipment using these techniques can offer high throughput at
   distances above 100 kilometers.

Internet-Draft       Alternative Network Deployments        January 2016


5.2.1.2.  GSM

   GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), from ETSI, has also
   been used in Alternative Networks as a Layer 2 option, as explained
   in [Mexican], [Village], [Heimerl].

5.2.1.3.  Dynamic Spectrum

   Some Alternative Networks make use of TV White Spaces - a set of UHF
   and VHF television frequencies that can be utilized by secondary
   users in locations where they are unused by licensed primary users
   such as television broadcasters.  Equipment that makes use of TV
   White Spaces is required to detect the presence of existing unused TV
   channels by means of a spectrum database and/or spectrum sensing in
   order to ensure that no harmful interference is caused to primary
   users.  In order to smartly allocate interference-free channels to
   the devices, cognitive radios are used which are able to modify their
   frequency, power and modulation techniques to meet the strict
   operating conditions required for secondary users.

   The use of the term "White Spaces" is often used to describe "TV
   White Spaces" as the VHF and UHF television frequencies were the
   first to be exploited on a secondary use basis.  There are two
   dominant standards for TV white space communication: (i) the 802.11af
   standard [IEEE.802-11AF.2013] - an adaptation of the 802.11 standard
   for TV white space bands and (ii) the IEEE 802.22 standard
   [IEEE.802-22.2011] for long-range rural communication.

5.2.1.3.1.  802.11af

   802.11af [IEEE.802-11AF.2013] is a modified version of the 802.11
   standard operating in TV White Space bands using Cognitive Radios to
   avoid interference with primary users.  The standard is often
   referred to as White-Fi or "Super Wi-Fi" and was approved in February
   2014. 802.11af contains much of the advances of all the 802.11
   standards including recent advances in 802.11ac such as up to four
   bonded channels, four spatial streams and very high rate 256-QAM
   modulation but with improved in-building penetration and outdoor
   coverage.  The maximum data rate achievable is 426.7 Mbps for
   countries with 6/7 MHz channels and 568.9 Mbps for countries with 8
   MHz channels.  Coverage is typically limited to 1km although longer
   range at lower throughput and using high gain antennas will be
   possible.

   Devices are designated as enabling stations (Access Points) or
   dependent stations (clients).  Enabling stations are authorized to
   control the operation of a dependent station and securely access a
   geolocation database.  Once the enabling station has received a list



Saldana, et al.           Expires July 17, 2016                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft       Alternative Network Deployments        January 2016


   of available white space channels it can announce a chosen channel to
   the dependent stations for them to communicate with the enabling
   station. 802.11af also makes use of a registered location server - a
   local database that organizes the geographic location and operating
   parameters of all enabling stations.

5.2.1.3.2.  802.22

   802.22 [IEEE.802-22.2011] is a standard developed specifically for
   long range rural communications in TV white space frequencies and
   first approved in July 2011.  The standard is similar to the 802.16
   (WiMax) [IEEE.802-16.2008] standard with an added cognitive radio
   ability.  The maximum throughput of 802.22 is 22.6 Mbps for a single
   8 MHz channel using 64-QAM modulation.  The achievable range using
   the default MAC scheme is 30 km, however 100 km is possible with
   special scheduling techniques.  The MAC of 802.22 is specifically
   customized for long distances - for example, slots in a frame
   destined for more distant Consumer Premises Equipment (CPEs) are sent
   before slots destined for nearby CPEs.

   Base stations are required to have a Global Positioning System (GPS)
   and a connection to the Internet in order to query a geolocation
   spectrum database.  Once the base station receives the allowed TV
   channels, it communicates a preferred operating white space TV
   channel with the CPE devices.  The standard also includes a co-
   existence mechanism that uses beacons to make other 802.22 base
   stations aware of the presence of a base station that is not part of
   the same network.

6.  Upper layers

6.1.  Layer 3

6.1.1.  IP addressing

   Most known Alternative Networks started in or around the year 2000.
   IPv6 was fully specified by then, but almost all Alternative Networks
   still use IPv4.  A survey [Avonts] indicated that IPv6 rollout
   presents a challenge to Community Networks.

   Most Community Networks use private IPv4 address ranges, as defined
   by [RFC1918].  The motivation for this was the lower cost and the
   simplified IP allocation because of the large available address

6.1.2.  Routing protocols

   As stated in previous sections, Alternative Networks are composed of
   possibly different layer 2 devices, resulting in a mesh of nodes.
   Connection between different nodes is not guaranteed and the link
   stability can vary strongly over time.  To tackle this, some
   Alternative Networks use mesh network routing protocols while other
   networks use more traditional routing protocols.  Some networks
   operate multiple routing protocols in parallel.  For example, they
   use a mesh protocol inside different islands and use traditional
   routing protocols to connect these islands.

6.1.2.1.  Traditional routing protocols

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), as defined by [RFC4271] is used by
   a number of Community Networks, because of its well-studied behavior
   and scalability.

   For similar reasons, smaller networks opt to run the Open Shortest
   Path First (OSPF) protocol, as defined by [RFC2328].

6.1.2.2.  Mesh routing protocols

   A large number of Alternative Networks use the Optimized Link State
   Routing Protocol (OLSR) as defined in [RFC3626].  The pro-active link
   state routing protocol is a good match with Alternative Networks
   because it has good performance in mesh networks where nodes have
   multiple interfaces.

   The Better Approach To Mobile Adhoc Networking (BATMAN) [Abolhasan]
   protocol was developed by members of the Freifunk community.  The
   protocol handles all routing at layer 2, creating one bridged
   network.

   Parallel to BGP, some networks also run the BatMan-eXperimental
   (BMX6) protocol [Neumann].  This is an advanced version of the BATMAN
   protocol which is based on IPv6 and tries to exploit the social
   structure of Alternative Networks.

6.2.  Transport layer

6.2.1.  Traffic Management when sharing network resources

   When network resources are shared (as e.g. in the networks explained
   in Section 4.4), special care has to be taken with the management of
   the traffic at upper layers.  From a crowdshared perspective, and
   considering just regular TCP connections during the critical sharing
   time, the Access Point offering the service is likely to be the

   bottleneck of the connection.  This is the main concern of sharers,
   having several implications.  There should be an adequate Active
   Queue Management (AQM) mechanism that implements a Lower-than-best-
   effort (LBE) [RFC6297] policy for the user and protects the sharer.
   Achieving LBE behavior requires the appropriate tuning of the well
   known mechanisms such as Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
   [RFC3168], or Random Early Detection (RED) [RFC2309], or other more
   recent AQM mechanisms such as Controlled Delay (CoDel) and
   [I-D.ietf-aqm-codel] PIE (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced)
   [I-D.ietf-aqm-pie] that aid low latency.

6.3.  Services provided

   This section provides an overview of the services between hosts
   inside the network.  They can be divided into Intranet services,
   connecting hosts between them, and Internet services, connecting to
   nodes outside the network.

6.3.1.  Intranet services

   Intranet services can include, but are not limited to:

   - VoIP (e.g. with SIP).

   - Remote desktop (e.g. using my home computer and my Internet
   connection when I am away).

   - FTP file sharing (e.g. distribution of software).

   - P2P file sharing.

   - Public video cameras.

   - DNS.

   - Online games servers.

   - Jabber instant messaging.

   - IRC chat.

   - Weather stations.

   - NTP.

   - Network monitoring.

   - Videoconferencing / streaming.

   - Radio streaming.

6.3.2.  Access to the Internet

6.3.2.1.  Web browsing proxies

   A number of federated proxies may provide web browsing service for
   the users.  Other services (file sharing, VoIP, etc.) are not usually
   allowed in many Alternative Networks due to bandwidth limitations.

6.3.2.2.  Use of VPNs

   Some "micro-ISPs" may use the network as a backhaul for providing
   Internet access, setting up VPNs from the client to a machine with
   Internet access.
