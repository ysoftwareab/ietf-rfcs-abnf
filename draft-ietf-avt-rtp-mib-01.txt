Internet Draft   RTP MIB                         November 18, 1997


1.  Changes from Previous Draft


   (1) The DESCRIPTION clauses are changed for those rtpEgEntry and 
       rtpInEntry objects that also appear in RTCP messages.  The 
       current values are always to be used rather than the values 
       from the last RTCP message for MIB objects that are also defined 
       in RTCP.

   (2) Interfaces in rtpEgEntry, rtpInEntry and rtpSessionEntry are now
       defined by a pair of InterfaceIndex and IpAddress object
       instances.  InterfaceIndex is a Textual Convention that is
       introduced in this MIB to be zero when the interface has an
       IP Address; otherwise it is the IfIndex from the IF-MIB.

   (3) rtpEgIndex and rtpInIndex are added to serve as the sole indexes 
       to rtpEgEntry and rtpInEntry respectively.  This change is needed
       to support multi-homed RTP hosts.

   (4) rtpEgStartTime, rtpInStartTime and rtpSessionStartTime are added 
       for the purpose of recording the SysUpTime value at the time of 
       conceptual row creation as required by RFC 1902 for conceptual 
       rows that contain counters that do not become active at the 
       start of the epoch.

   (5) rtpEgTool DEFVAL comment no longer refers to RTCP SDES.

   (6) The interarrival jitter estimator was added to the rtpInEntry
       and the rtpRREntry.

   (7) rtpInPackets added to count the total number of RTP data packets 
       that are received.

   (8) rtpSessionIfIndex changed to 'read-create.'

   (9) A potential problem of the duplicate counting of rtpSessionSenders
       and rtpSessionReceivers is mentioned in their DESCRIPTION clauses.

   (10) rtpRREntry's last two indexes are reversed with rtpSRSSRC appear-
       ing before rtpRRSSRC to permit tree walks organized by sender.

   (11) DisplayString is used in place of OCTET STRING for CNAME's and
        Tool names.

   (12) Unsigned32 used for SSRC's in place of INTEGER.

   (13) OID values are renumbered for  rtpIS, rtpISGlobals, rtpSRTable,
        rtpRRTable, rtpRRFracLost and subsequent columns of rtpRREntry.

Internet Draft   RTP MIB                         November 18, 1997

2.  Abstract

This memo defines an experimental  Management Information Base
(MIB) for use with network management protocols in 
TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it defines objects for 
managing Real-Time Transport Protocol systems [1].  Comments 
should be made to the IETF Audio/Video Transport Working Group
at rem-conf@es.net.

This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
community.


3.  The Network Management Framework

The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of the
following major components:

RFC 1902 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

RFC 1903 Textual Conventions for Version 2 of the Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2).

RFC 1904 Conformance Statements for Version 2 of the
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2).

RFC 1905 Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2).

RFC 1906 Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2).

RFC 1907 Management Information Base for Version 2 of 
the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2).

RFC 1908 Coexistence between Version 1 and Version 2 of
the Internet-standard Network Management Framework.

The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

Internet Draft   RTP MIB                         November 18, 1997

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Within a given
MIB module, objects are defined using the SMI's OBJECT-TYPE
macro[2].  At a minimum, each object has a name, a syntax, an
access-level, and an implementation-status.

The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned
name, which specifies an object type.  The object type
together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience,
we often use a textual string, termed the object descriptor,
to also refer to the object type.

The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1[3]
language is used for this purpose.  However, RFC 1902
purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
These restrictions are made for simplicity.

The access-level of an object type defines whether it makes
"protocol sense" to read and/or write the value of an instance
of the object type.  (This access-level is independent of any
administrative authorization policy.)

The implementation-status of an object type indicates whether
the object is mandatory, optional, obsolete, or deprecated.


4. Overview

An "RTP System" may be a host end-system that runs an application
program that sends or receives RTP data packets, or it may be an
intermediate-system that forwards RTP packets.  RTP Control 
Protocol (RTCP) packets are sent by senders and receivers to 
convey information about RTP packet transmission and reception [1].

4.1 Textual Conventions

A new data type, InterfaceIndex, is introduced as a textual convention in 
this MIB document.  Textual conventions enhance the readability of
the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications
if appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of the
textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the
semantics of any managed objects.  The use of these is merely an
artifact of the explanatory method used.  Objects defined in terms of
one of these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that
define the primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP
are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are
adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers.

Internet Draft   RTP MIB                         November 18, 1997

4.2 Components

The RTP MIB is structured around "Session," "Receiver" and "Sender" 
conceptual abstractions.

4.2.1  An "RTP Session" is the "...association of participants
communicating with RTP.  For each participant, the session is
defined by a particular pair of destination transport addresses
(one network address plus a port pair for RTP and RTCP).  The
destination transport addresses may be common for all participants,
as in the case of IP multicast, or may be different for each, as in
the case of individual unicast addresses plus a common port pair,"
as defined in section 3 of [1].

4.2.2 A "Sender" is identified by a 32-bit numeric "Synchronization 
Source," or "SSRC", value and is "...the source of a stream of RTP 
packets" as defined in section 3 of [1].  The Sender is also a source 
of RTCP Sender Report packets as specified in section 6 of [1].

4.2.3 A "Receiver" of a "stream of RTP packets" can be a unicast or
multicast Receiver as described in 4.2.1, above. An RTP Receiver has 
an SSRC value that is unique to the session.  An RTP Receiver is a 
source of RTCP Receiver Reports as specified in section 6 of [1].


4.3 Applicability of the MIB to RTP System Implementations 

The RTP MIB may be used in two types of RTP implementations, RTP Host
Systems (end systems)  and RTP Monitors, see section 3 of [1].  
Use of the RTP MIB for RTP Translators and Mixers, as defined in 
section 7 of [1], is for further study.

4.3.1 RTP Host Systems are end-systems that may use the RTP MIB 
to collect RTP Session and Stream data; these data may be used
by a network manager to diagnose faults that occur over the life time
of an RTP Session as in a "help-desk" scenario.

4.3.2 RTP Monitors of multicast RTP sessions may be located in an RTP
intermediate-system or in the host.  RTP Monitors may use the RTP 
MIB to collect RTP Session and Stream statistical data; these data may 
be used by a network manager for capacity planning and other 
network-management purposes.  An RTP Monitor may also use the RTP MIB 
to collect data to permit a network manager to diagnose faults in RTP 
sessions, or to permit a network manger to configure the Monitor.

Internet Draft   RTP MIB                         November 18, 1997


4.4  The Structure of the RTP MIB

There are two modules in the RTP MIB:  The RTP-SYSTEM module
is used for RTP Host Systems, and the RTP-IS module is designed
for RTP Monitors.  There are two tables in RTP-SYSTEM and three 
tables in RTP-IS.

RTP-SYSTEM Tables:
      rtpInTable
      rtpEgTable

These tables contain information about RTP Streams that an RTP
end system is sending (rtpEgTable) or receiving (rtpInTable).

These tables are not intended for use by RTP Monitors.  rtpInTable
and rtpEgTable do not contain objects which are creatable nor 
writable by a network manager.  The rtpSessionTable in RTP-IS 
permits conceptual rows to be created by a network manager for the 
purpose of identifying RTP sessions to be monitored.

RTP-IS Tables:
      rtpSessionTable
      rtpSRTable
      rtpRRTable

rtpSessionNewIndex is a global object that permits a network-management
application to obtain a unique index for conceptual row creation
in the rtpSessionTable.  In this way the SNMP Set operation may
be used to configure a monitor which implements RTP-IS.

4.5  SNMP Implementations

An RTP System that runs either a single application or multiple 
applications with a single management-entity may be a practical 
configuration for monitoring, translating or mixing.  Host end-
-systems are the vast majority of RTP implementations, however,
and a "monolithic" solution may be inadequate if management of
RTP end-systems proves to be truly useful.  The RTP-SYSTEM module 
described in 4.4 contains tables that may be shared among RTP 
application programs that run concurrently on the same device - as
many or most do.  Sharing occurs on a table basis, and this may
be complicated on some host systems.  Rows in the RTP MIB tables, 
however, are uniquely identified by RTP Session and SSRC pairs 
(or a pair of SSRCs for RTP Receivers).  If the RTP Session and 
SSRC values are unique to the RTP application program, then 
conceptual rows do not need to be shared.

Internet Draft   RTP MIB                         November 18, 1997


Table sharing may be a problem for SNMP management entities on some
host operting systems:  All SNMP management requests are sent to UDP 
Port 161, and an Application Programming Interface (API) is needed to 
facilitate this sharing.  The API is specific to the host operating 
system, and there are solutions provided by host operating system 
vendors and by independent software vendors.  There is also a 
standardization effort within the IETF to at least define a standard 
system-interface protocol that may be implemented in an API to permit 
multiple management entities to share the object name space[4].  Whether
or not independent RTP application programs can cooperatively and
concurrently support the RTP MIB is outside the scope of this draft
document and will differ depending on the operating system in question.

Internet Draft   RTP MIB                         November 18, 1997


6.  Security Issues

In most cases, MIBs are not themselves security risks; if SNMP security 
is operating as intended, the use of a MIB to view information about a 
system, or to change some parameter at the system, is a tool, not a 
threat.

None of the read-only objects in this MIB reports a password, though
some SDES items such as the CNAME, the canonical name, may be deemed
sensitive depending on the particular security policies of a particular
enterprise.  If access to these objects is not limited by an 
appropriate access control policy, these objects can provide an attacker 
with information about a system's configuration and the services that 
that system is providing.  Some enterprises view their network and 
system configurations themselves, as well as information about usage and
performance, as corporate assets; such enterprises may wish to restrict 
SNMP access to most of the objects in the MIB.

This MIB supports read-write operations against rtpSessionNewIndex which
has the side effect of creating an entry in the rtpSessionTable when it
is written to.  Three objects in rtpSessionEntry have read-create access:
rtpSessionAddr, rtpSessionIfIndex and rtpSessionIfAddr identify an RTP
Session to be monitored on a particular monitor interface.  The values
of these objects are not to be changed once created, and initialization
of these objects affects only the monitoring of an RTP Session and
not the operation of an RTP Session on any host end-system.  Since
write operations to rtpSessionNewIndex and the three objects in 
rtpSessionEntry affect the operation of the monitor, write access
to these objects should be subject to the appropriate access control
policy.

Confidentiality of RTP and RTCP data packets is defined in section 9 of 
the RTP specification [1].  Encryption may be performed on RTP packets,
RTCP packets, or both.  Encryption of RTCP packets may pose a problem
for third-party monitors though "For RTCP, it is allowed to split a
compound RTCP packet into two lower-layer packets, one to be encrypted
and one to be sent in the clear.  For example, SDES information might
be encrypted while reception reports were sent in the clear to 
accommodate third-party monitors [1]."
