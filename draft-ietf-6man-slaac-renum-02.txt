Improving the Robustness of Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
                      to Flash Renumbering Events
                     draft-ietf-6man-slaac-renum-02

Abstract

   In renumbering scenarios where an IPv6 prefix suddenly becomes
   invalid, hosts on the local network will continue using stale
   prefixes for an unacceptably long period of time, thus resulting in
   connectivity problems.  This document improves the reaction of IPv6
   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration to such renumbering scenarios.

Internet-Draft       Reaction to Renumbering Events         January 2021


1.  Introduction

   IPv6 network renumbering is expected to take place in a planned
   manner, with old/stale prefixes being phased-out via reduced prefix
   lifetimes while new prefixes (with normal lifetimes) are introduced.
   However, there are a number of scenarios that may lead to the so-
   called "flash-renumbering" events, where the prefix being employed on
   a network suddenly becomes invalid and replaced by a new prefix
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-slaac-renum].  In such scenarios, hosts on the local
   network will continue using stale prefixes for an unacceptably long
   period of time, thus resulting in connectivity problems.
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-slaac-renum] discusses this problem in detail.

   In some scenarios, the local router producing the network renumbering
   event may try to deprecate the currently-employed prefixes (thus
   explicitly signaling the network about the renumbering event),
   whereas in other scenarios it may be unaware about the renumbering
   event and thus unable signal hosts about it.

   From the perspective of a Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
   host, there are two different (but related) problems to be solved:

   o  Avoiding the use of stale addresses for new communication
      instances

   o  Performing "garbage collection" for the stale prefixes (and
      related network configuration information)

   Clearly, if a host has both working and stale addresses, it is
   paramount that it employs working addresses for new communication
   instances.  Additionally, a host should also perform garbage
   collection for the stale prefixes/addresses, since they not only tie
   system resources, but also prevent communication with the new
   "owners" of the stale prefixes.

2.  Terminology

   The term "globally reachable" is used in this document as defined in
   [RFC8190].

   The term "Global Unicast Address" (or its acronym "GUA") is used
   throughout this document to refer to "globally reachable" [RFC8190]
   addresses.  That is, when used throughout this document, GUAs do NOT
   include Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) [RFC4193].  Similarly, the term
   "Global Unicast prefix" (or "GUA prefix") is employed throughout this
   document to refer to network prefixes that specify GUAs, and does NOT
   include the ULA prefix (FC00::/7) [RFC4193].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  SLAAC reaction to Flash-renumbering Events

   As noted in Section 1, in some scenarios the router triggering the
   renumbering event may be able to explicitly signal the network about
   this event, while in other scenarios the renumbered hosts may need to
   infer a renumbering event is taking place.  The following subsections
   analyze specific considerations for each of these scenarios.

3.1.  Renumbering without Explicit Signaling

   In the absence of explicit signalling from SLAAC routers (such as
   sending Prefix Information Options (PIOs) with small lifetimes to
   deprecate the stale prefixes), stale prefixes will remain preferred
   and valid according to the Preferred Lifetime and Valid Lifetime
   values (respectively) of the last received PIO.  IPv6 SLAAC employs
   the following default values for PIOs:

   o  Preferred Lifetime (AdvPreferredLifetime): 604800 seconds (7 days)

   o  Valid Lifetime (AdvValidLifetime): 2592000 seconds (30 days)

   This means that, in the absence of explicit signaling by a SLAAC
   router to deprecate a prefix, it will take a host 7 days (one week)
   to deprecate the corresponding addresses, and 30 days (one month) to
   eventually remove any addresses configured for the stale prefix.
   Clearly, for any practical purposes, employing such long default
   values is the equivalent of not using any timers at all, since taking
   7 days or 30 days (respectively) to recover from a network problem is
   simply unacceptable.

   Use of more appropriate timers in Router Advertisement messages can
   help limit the amount of time that hosts will maintain stale
   configuration information.  Additionally, hosts are normally in a
   position to infer that a prefix has become stale -- for example, if a
   given router ceases to advertise an existing prefix and at the same
   time starts to advertise a new prefix.

   Section 4.1.1 recommends the use of more appropriate default
   lifetimes for PIOs, while Section 4.5 specifies a local policy that
   SLAAC hosts can implement to heuristically infer that network
   configuration information has changed, such that stale configuration
   information can be phased out.

3.2.  Renumbering with Explicit Signaling

   In scenarios where a local router is aware about the renumbering
   event, it may try to phase out the stale network configuration
   information.  In these scenarios, there are two aspects to be
   considered:

   o  The amount of time during which the router should continue trying
      to deprecate the stale network configuration information

   o  The ability of SLAAC hosts to phase out stale configuration in a
      timelier manner.

   In the absence of Router Advertisements (RAs) that include PIOs that
   would reduce the Valid Lifetime and Preferred Lifetime of a prefix,
   hosts would normally employ the lifetime values from PIO options of
   the last received RA messages.  Since the network could be
   partitioned for an arbitrarily long period of time, a router would
   need to try to deprecate a prefix for the amount of time employed for
   the "Preferred Lifetime", and try to invalidate the prefix for the
   amount of time employed for the "Valid Lifetime" (see Section 12 of
   [RFC4861]).

   NOTE:
      Once the number of seconds in the original "Preferred Lifetime"
      have elapsed, all hosts would have deprecated the corresponding
      addresses anyway, while once the number of seconds in the "Valid
      Lifetime" have elapsed, the corresponding addresses would be
      invalidated and removed.

   Thus, use of more appropriate default lifetimes for PIOs, as proposed
   in Section 4.1.1, would reduce the amount of time a stale prefix
   would need to be announced as such by a router in order to make sure
   that it is deprecated/invalidated.

   In scenarios where a router has positive knowledge that a prefix has
   become invalid and thus could signal this condition to local hosts,
   the current specifications will prevent SLAAC hosts from fully
   recovering from such stale information.  Item "e)" of Section 5.5.3
   of [RFC4862] specifies that an RA may never reduce the
   "RemainingLifetime" to less than two hours.  Additionally, if the
   RemainingLifetime of an address is smaller than 2 hours, then a Valid
   Lifetime smaller than 2 hours will be ignored.  The inability to
   invalidate a stale prefix would prevent communication with the new
   "owners" of the stale prefix, and thus is highly undesirable.  On the
   other hand, the Preferred Lifetime of an address *can* be reduced to
   any value to avoid the use of a stale prefix for new communications.

   Section 4.2 updates [RFC4862] such that this restriction in removed,
   and hosts react to the advertised "Valid Lifetime" (even if it is
   smaller than 2 hours).

   Finally, Section 4.3 recommends that routers disseminate network
   configuration information when a network interface is initialized,
   such that possibly new configuration information propagates in a
   timelier manner.

4.  Improvements to Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)

   The following subsections update [RFC4861] and [RFC4862], such that
   the problem discussed in this document is mitigated.  The
   aforementioned updates are mostly orthogonal, and mitigate different
   aspects of SLAAC that prevent a timely reaction to flash renumbering
   events.

   o  Reduce the default Valid Lifetime and Preferred Lifetime of PIOs
      (Section 4.1.1):
      This helps limit the amount of time a host will employ stale
      information, and also limits the amount of time a router needs to
      try to obsolete stale information.

   o  Honor PIOs with small Valid Lifetimes (Section 4.2):
      This allows routers to invalidate stale prefixes, since otherwise
      [RFC4861] prevents hosts from honoring PIOs with a Valid Lifetime
      smaller than two hours.

   o  Recommend routers to retransmit configuration information upon
      interface initialization/reinitialization (Section 4.3):
      This helps spread the new information in a timelier manner, and
      also deprecate stale information via host-side heuristics (see
      Section 4.5).

   o  Recommend routers to always send all options (i.e. the complete
      configuration information) in RA messages, and in the smallest
      possible number of packets (Section 4.4):
      This helps propagate the same information to all hosts, and also
      allows hosts to better infer that information missing in RA
      messages has become stale (see Section 4.5).

   o  Infer stale network configuration information from received RAs
      (Section 4.5):
      This allows hosts to deprecate stale network configuration
      information, even in the absence of explicit signaling.

4.1.  More Appropriate Lifetime Values

4.1.1.  Router Configuration Variables

   The default values of the Preferred Lifetime and the Valid Lifetime
   of PIOs are updated as follows:

      AdvPreferredLifetime: max(AdvDefaultLifetime, 3 *
      MaxRtrAdvInterval)

      AdvValidLifetime: 2 * AdvPreferredLifetime

   where:

   AdvPreferredLifetime:
      Value to be placed in the "Preferred Lifetime" field of the PIO.

   AdvValidLifetime:
      Value to be placed in the "Valid Lifetime" field of the PIO.

   AdvDefaultLifetime:
      Value to be placed in the "Router Lifetime" field of the Router
      Advertisement message that will carry the PIO.

   max():
      A function that computes the maximum of its arguments.

   NOTE:
      [RFC4861] specifies the default value of MaxRtrAdvInterval as 600
      seconds, and the default value of AdvDefaultLifetime as 3 *
      MaxRtrAdvInterval.  Therefore, when employing default values for
      MaxRtrAdvInterval and AdvDefaultLifetime, the default values of
      AdvPreferredLifetime and AdvValidLifetime become 1800 seconds (30
      minutes) and 3600 seconds (1 one hour), respectively.  We note
      that when implementing BCP202 [RFC7772], AdvDefaultLifetime will
      typically be in the range of 45-90 minutes, and therefore the
      default value of AdvPreferredLifetime will be in the range 45-90
      minutes, while the default value of AdvValidLifetime will be in
      the range of 90-180 minutes.

   RATIONALE:

      *  The default values of the PIO lifetimes should be such that,
         under normal circumstances (including some packet loss), the
         associated timers are refreshed/reset, but in the presence of
         network failures (such as network configuration information
         becoming stale), some fault recovering action (such as

Internet-Draft       Reaction to Renumbering Events         January 2021


         deprecating the corresponding addresses and subsequently
         removing them) is triggered.

      *  In the context of [RFC8028], where it is clear that the use of
         addresses configured for a given prefix is tied to the next-hop
         router that advertised the prefix, the "Preferred Lifetime" of
         a PIO should not be larger than the "Router Lifetime" of Router
         Advertisement messages.  Some leeway should be provided for the
         "Valid Lifetime" of PIOs, to cope with transient network
         problems.  As a result, this document updates [RFC4861] such
         that the default Valid Lifetime (AdvValidLifetime) and the
         default Preferred Lifetime (AdvPreferredLifetime) of PIOs are
         specified as a function of the "Router Lifetime"
         (AdvDefaultLifetime) of Router Advertisement messages.  In the
         absence of RAs that refresh information, addresses configured
         for previously-advertised prefixes become deprecated in a
         timelier manner, and thus Rule 3 of [RFC6724] will cause other
         configured addresses (if available) to be preferred.

      *  The expression above computes the maximum between
         AdvDefaultLifetime and "3 * MaxRtrAdvInterval" (the default
         value of AdvDefaultLifetime, as per [RFC4861]) to cope with the
         case where an operator might simply want to disable one local
         router for maintenance, without disabling the use of the
         corresponding prefixes on the local network (e.g., on a multi-
         router network).  [RFC4862] implementations would otherwise
         deprecate the corresponding prefixes.  Similarly, [RFC8028]
         implementations would likely behave in the same way.

4.2.  Honor Small PIO Valid Lifetimes

   The entire item "e)" (pp. 19-20) from Section 5.5.3 of [RFC4862] is
   replaced with the following text:

      e) If the advertised prefix is equal to the prefix of an address
      configured by stateless autoconfiguration in the list, the valid
      lifetime and the preferred lifetime of the address should be
      updated by processing the Valid Lifetime and the Preferred
      Lifetime (respectively) in the received advertisement.

   RATIONALE:

      *  This change allows hosts to react to the information provided
         by a router that has positive knowledge that a prefix has
         become invalid.

      *  The behavior described in RFC4862 had been incorporated during
         the revision of the original IPv6 Stateless Address

         Autoconfiguration specification ([RFC1971]).  At the time, the
         IPNG working group decided to mitigate the attack vector
         represented by Prefix Information Options with very short
         lifetimes, on the premise these packets represented a bigger
         risk than other ND-based attack vectors [IPNG-minutes].

         While reconsidering the trade-offs represented by such
         decision, we conclude that the drawbacks of mitigating the
         aforementioned attack vector outweigh the possible benefits.

         In scenarios where RA-based attacks are of concern, proper
         mitigations such as RA-Guard [RFC6105] [RFC7113] or SEND
         [RFC3971] should be implemented.

4.3.  Interface Initialization

   When an interface is initialized, it is paramount that network
   configuration information is spread on the corresponding network
   (particularly in scenarios where an interface has been re-
   initialized, and the conveyed information has changed).  Thus, this
   document replaces the following text from Section 6.2.4 of [RFC4861]:

      In such cases, the router MAY transmit up to
      MAX_INITIAL_RTR_ADVERTISEMENTS unsolicited advertisements, using
      the same rules as when an interface becomes an advertising
      interface.

   with:

      In such cases, the router SHOULD transmit
      MAX_INITIAL_RTR_ADVERTISEMENTS unsolicited advertisements, using
      the same rules as when an interface becomes an advertising
      interface.

   RATIONALE:

      *  Use of stale information can lead to interoperability problems.
         Therefore, it is important that new configuration information
         propagates in a timelier manner to all hosts.

   NOTE:
      [I-D.ietf-v6ops-cpe-slaac-renum] specifies recommendations for CPE
      routers to deprecate any stale network configuration information.

6.  Implementation Status

   [NOTE: This section is to be removed by the RFC-Editor before this
   document is published as an RFC.]

   This section summarizes the implementation status of the updates
   proposed in this document.  In some cases, they correspond to
   variants of the mitigations proposed in this document (e.g., use of
   reduced default lifetimes for PIOs, albeit using different values
   than those recommended in this document).  In such cases, we believe
   these implementations signal the intent to deal with the problems
   described in [I-D.ietf-v6ops-slaac-renum] while lacking any guidance
   on the best possible approach to do it.

6.1.  More Appropriate Lifetime Values

6.1.1.  Router Configuration Variables

6.1.1.1.  rad(8)

   We have produced a patch for OpenBSD's rad(8) [rad] that employs the
   default lifetimes recommended in this document, albeit it has not yet
   been committed to the tree.  The patch is available at:
   <https://www.gont.com.ar/code/fgont-patch-rad-pio-lifetimes.txt>.

6.1.1.2.  radvd(8)

   The radvd(8) daemon [radvd], normally employed by Linux-based router
   implementations, currently employs different default lifetimes than
   those recommended in [RFC4861]. radvd(8) employs the following
   default values [radvd.conf]:

   o  Preferred Lifetime: 14400 seconds (4 hours)

   o  Valid Lifetime: 86400 seconds (1 day)

   bu is already a deviation from the current standards.

6.2.  Honor Small PIO Valid Lifetimes

6.2.1.  Linux Kernel

   A Linux kernel implementation of this document has been committed to
   the net-next tree.  The implementation was produced in April 2020 by
   Fernando Gont <fgont@si6networks.com>.  The corresponding patch can
   be found at: <https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/
   patch/20200419122457.GA971@archlinux-current.localdomain/>

6.2.2.  NetworkManager

   NetworkManager [NetworkManager] processes RA messages with a Valid
   Lifetime smaller than two hours as recommended in this document.

6.3.  Conveying Information in Router Advertisement (RA) Messages

   We know of no implementation that splits network configuration
   information into multiple RA messages.

6.4.  Recovery from Stale Configuration Information without Explicit
      Signaling

6.4.1.  dhcpcd(8)

   The dhcpcd(8) daemon [dhcpcd], a user-space SLAAC implementation
   employed by some Linux-based and BSD-derived operating systems, will
   set the Preferred Lifetime of addresses corresponding to a given
   prefix to 0 when a single RA from the router that previously
   advertised the prefix fails to advertise the corresponding prefix.
   However, it does not affect the corresponding Valid Lifetime.
   Therefore, it can be considered a partial implementation of this
   feature.

6.5.  Other mitigations implemented in products

   [FRITZ] is a Customer Edge Router that tries to deprecate stale
   prefixes by advertising stale prefixes with a Preferred Lifetime of
   0, and a Valid Lifetime of 2 hours (or less).  There are two things
   to note with respect to this implementation:

   o  Rather than recording prefixes on stable storage (as recommended
      in [I-D.ietf-v6ops-cpe-slaac-renum]), this implementation checks
      the source address of IPv6 packets, and assumes that usage of any
      address that does not correspond to a prefix currently-advertised

      by the Customer Edge Router is the result of stale network
      configuration information.  Hence, upon receipt of a packet that
      employs a source address that does not correspond to a currently-
      advertised prefix, this implementation will start advertising the
      corresponding prefix with small lifetimes, with the intent of
      deprecating it.

   o  Possibly as a result of item "e)" (pp. 19-20) from Section 5.5.3
      of [RFC4862] (discussed in Section 4.2 of this document), upon
      first occurrence of a stale prefix, this implementation will
      employ a decreasing Valid Lifetime, starting from 2 hours (7200
      seconds), as opposed to a Valid Lifetime of 0.

7.  Security Considerations

   The protocol update in Section 4.2 could allow an on-link attacker to
   perform a Denial of Service attack against local hosts, by sending a
   forged RA with a PIO with a Valid Lifetime of 0.  Upon receipt of
   that packet, local hosts would invalidate the corresponding prefix,
   and therefore remove any addresses configured for that prefix,
   possibly terminating e.g.  TCP connections employing such addresses.
   However, an attacker may achieve similar effects via a number for ND-
   based attack vectors, such as directing traffic to a non-existing
   node until ongoing TCP connections time out, or performing a ND-based
   man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack and subsequently forging TCP RST
   segments to cause on-going TCP connections to be aborted.  Thus, for
   all practical purposes, this attack vector does not really represent
   a greater risk than other ND attack vectors.  As noted in Section 4.2
   , in scenarios where RA-based attacks are of concern, proper
   mitigations such as RA-Guard [RFC6105] [RFC7113] or SEND [RFC3971]
   should be implemented.

Appendix A.  Analysis of Some Suggested Workarounds

   [This section is to be removed before publication of this document as
   an RFC].

   During the discussion of this document, some alternative workarounds
   were suggested on the 6man mailing-list.  The following subsections
   analyze these suggested workarounds, in the hopes of avoiding
   rehashing the same discussions.

A.1.  On a Possible Reaction to ICMPv6 Error Messages

   It has been suggested that if configured addresses become stale, a
   CPE enforcing ingress/egress filtering (BCP38) ([RFC2827]) could send
   ICMPv6 Type 1 (Destination Unreachable) Code 5 (Source address failed
   ingress/egress policy) error messages to the sending node, and that,
   upon receipt of such error messages, the sending node could perform
   heuristics that might help to mitigate the problem discussed in this
   document.

   The aforementioned proposal has a number of drawbacks and
   limitations:

   o  It assumes that the CPE routers enforce ingress/egress filtering
      [RFC2827].  While this is desirable behaviour, it cannot be relied
      upon.

   o  It assumes that if the CPE enforces ingress/egress filtering, the
      CPE will signal the packet drops to the sending node with ICMPv6
      Type 1 (Destination Unreachable) Code 5 (Source address failed
      ingress/egress policy) error messages.  While this may be
      desirable, [RFC2827] does not suggest signaling the packet drops
      with ICMPv6 error messages, let alone the use of specific error
      messages (such as Type 1 Code 5) as suggested.

   o  ICMPv6 Type 1 Code 5 could be interpreted as the employed address
      being stale, but also as a selected route being inappropriate/
      suboptimal.  If the later, deprecating addresses or invalidating
      addresses upon receipt of these error messages would be
      inappropriate.

   o  Reacting to these error messages would create a new attack vector
      that could be exploited from remote networks.  This is of
      particular concern since ICMP-based attacks do not even require
      that the Source Address of the attack packets be spoofed
      [RFC5927].

A.2.  On a Possible Improvement to Source Address Selection

   [RFC6724] specifies source address selection (SAS) for IPv6.
   Conceptually, it sorts the candidate set of source addresses for a
   given destination, based on a number of pair-wise comparison rules
   that must be successively applied until there is a "winning" address.

   An implementation might improve source address selection, and prefer
   the most-recently advertised information.  In order to incorporate
   the "freshness" of information in source address selection, an
   implementation would be updated as follows:

   o  The node is assumed to maintain a timer/counter that is updated at
      least once per second.  For example, the time(2) function from
      unix-like systems could be employed for this purpose.

   o  The local information associated with each prefix advertised via
      RAs on the local network is augmented with a "LastAdvertised"
      timestamp value.  Whenever an RA with a PIO with the "A" bit set
      for such prefix is received, the "LastAdvertised" timestamp is
      updated with the current value of the timer/counter.

   o  [RFC6724] is updated such that this rule is incorporated:

      Rule 7.5: Prefer fresh information  If one of the two source
         addresses corresponds to a prefix that has been more recently
         advertised, say LastAdvertised(SA) > LastAdvertised(SA), then
         prefer that address (SA in our case).

   A clear benefit of this approach is that a host will normally prefer
   "fresh" addresses over possibly stale addresses.

   However, there are a number of drawbacks associated with this
   approach:

   o  In scenarios where multiple prefixes are being advertised on the
      same LAN segment, the new SAS rule is *guaranteed* to result in
      non-deterministic behaviour, with hosts frequently changing the
      default source address.  This is certainly not desirable from a
      troubleshooting perspective.

   o  Since the rule must be incorporated before "Rule 8: Use longest
      matching prefix" from [RFC6724], it may lead to suboptimal paths.

   o  This new rule may help to improve the selection of a source
      address, but it does not help with the housekeeping (garbage
      collection) of configured information:

Internet-Draft       Reaction to Renumbering Events         January 2021


      *  If the stale prefix is re-used in another network, nodes
         employing stale addresses and routes for this prefix will be
         unable to communicate with the new "owner" of the prefix, since
         the stale prefix will most likely be considered "on-link".

      *  Given that the currently recommended default value for the
         "Valid Lifetime" of PIOs is 2592000 seconds (30 days), it would
         take too long for hosts to remove the configured addresses and
         routes for the stale prefix.  While the proposed update in
         Section 4.1 of this document would mitigate this problem, the
         lifetimes advertised by the local SLAAC router are not under
         the control of hosts.

   As a result, updating IPv6 source address selection does not relieve
   nodes from improving their SLAAC implementations as specified in
   Section 4, if at all desirable.  On the other hand, the algorithm
   specified in Section 4.5 would result in Rule 3 of [RFC6724]
   employing fresh addresses, without leading to non-deterministic
   behaviour.
