                   DTLS Encapsulation of SCTP Packets
                draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps-07.txt

Abstract

   The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport
   protocol originally defined to run on top of the network protocols
   IPv4 or IPv6.  This document specifies how SCTP can be used on top of
   the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol.  Using the
   encapsulation method described in this document, SCTP is agnostic
   about the protocols being used below DTLS, explicit IP addresses can
   not be used in the SCTP control chunks.  As a consequence, the SCTP
   associations are single homed.

1.  Overview

   The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) as defined in
   [RFC4960] is a transport protocol running on top of the network
   protocols IPv4 [RFC0791] or IPv6 [RFC2460].  This document specifies
   how SCTP is used on top of the Datagram Transport Layer Security
   (DTLS) protocol.  DTLS 1.0 is defined in [RFC4347] and the present
   latest version, DTLS 1.2, is defined in [RFC6347].  This
   encapsulation is used for example within the WebRTC protocol suite
   (see [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview] for an overview) for transporting
   non-SRTP data between browsers.  The architecture of this stack is
   described in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].

   Please note that the procedures defined in [RFC6951] for dealing with
   the UDP port numbers do not apply here.  When using the encapsulation
   defined in this document, SCTP is agnostic about the protocols used
   below DTLS.

2.  Conventions

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft               SCTP over DTLS                December 2014


3.  Encapsulation and Decapsulation Procedure

   When an SCTP packet is provided to the DTLS layer, the complete SCTP
   packet, consisting of the SCTP common header and a number of SCTP
   chunks, is handled as the payload of the application layer protocol
   of DTLS.  When the DTLS layer has processed a DTLS record containing
   a message of the application layer protocol, the payload is passed to
   the SCTP layer.  The SCTP layer expects an SCTP common header
   followed by a number of SCTP chunks.

4.  General Considerations

   An implementation of SCTP over DTLS MUST implement and use a path
   maximum transmission unit (MTU) discovery method that functions
   without ICMP to provide SCTP/DTLS with an MTU estimate.  An
   implementation of "Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery" [RFC4821]
   either in SCTP or DTLS is RECOMMENDED.

5.  DTLS Considerations

   The DTLS implementation MUST support DTLS 1.0 [RFC4347] and SHOULD
   support the most recently published version of DTLS, which is DTLS
   1.2 [RFC6347] as of December 2014.  In the absence of a revision to
   this document, the latter requirement applies to all future versions
   of DTLS when they are published as RFCs.  This document will only be
   revised if a revision to DTLS or SCTP makes a revision to the
   encapsulation necessary.

   SCTP performs segmentation and reassembly based on the path MTU.
   Therefore the DTLS layer MUST NOT use any compression algorithm.

   The DTLS MUST support sending messages larger than the current path
   MTU.  This might result in sending IP level fragmented messages.

   If path MTU discovery is performed by the DTLS layer, the method
   described in [RFC4821] MUST be used.  For probe packets, the
   extension defined in [RFC6520] MUST be used.

   If path MTU discovery is performed by the SCTP layer and IPv4 is used
   as the network layer protocol, the DTLS implementation SHOULD allow
   the DTLS user to enforce that the corresponding IPv4 packet is sent
   with the Don't Fragment (DF) bit set.  If controlling the DF bit is
   not possible, for example due to implementation restrictions, a safe
   value for the path MTU has to be used by the SCTP stack.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the safe value does not exceed 1200 bytes.  Please
   note that [RFC1122] only requires end hosts to be able to reassemble
   fragmented IP packets up to 576 bytes in length.

Internet-Draft               SCTP over DTLS                December 2014


   The DTLS implementation SHOULD allow the DTLS user to set the
   Differentiated services code point (DSCP) used for IP packets being
   sent (see [RFC2474]).  This requires the DTLS implementation to pass
   the value through and the lower layer to allow setting this value.
   If the lower layer does not support setting the DSCP, then the DTLS
   user will end up with the default value used by protocol stack.
   Please note that only a single DSCP value can be used for all packets
   belonging to the same SCTP association.

   Using explicit congestion notifications (ECN) in SCTP requires the
   DTLS layer to pass the ECN bits through and its lower layer to expose
   access to them for sent and received packets (see [RFC3168]).  The
   implementation of DTLS and its lower layer should provide this
   support.  If this is not possible, for example due to implementation
   restrictions, ECN can't be used by SCTP.

6.  SCTP Considerations

   This section describes the usage of the base protocol and the
   applicability of various SCTP extensions.

6.1.  Base Protocol

   This document uses SCTP [RFC4960] with the following restrictions,
   which are required to reflect that the lower layer is DTLS instead of
   IPv4 and IPv6 and that SCTP does not deal with the IP addresses or
   the transport protocol used below DTLS:

   o  A DTLS connection MUST be established before an SCTP association
      can be set up.

   o  Multiple SCTP associations MAY be multiplexed over a single DTLS
      connection.  The SCTP port numbers are used for multiplexing and
      demultiplexing the SCTP associations carried over a single DTLS
      connection.

   o  All SCTP associations are single-homed, because DTLS does not
      expose any address management to its upper layer.  Therefore it is
      RECOMMENDED to set the SCTP parameter path.max.retrans to
      association.max.retrans.

   o  The INIT and INIT-ACK chunk MUST NOT contain any IPv4 Address or
      IPv6 Address parameters.  The INIT chunk MUST NOT contain the
      Supported Address Types parameter.

   o  The implementation MUST NOT rely on processing ICMP or ICMPv6
      packets.  This applies in particular to path MTU discovery when
      performed by SCTP.

   o  If the SCTP is notified about a path change by its lower layers,
      SCTP SHOULD retest the Path MTU and reset the congestion state to
      the initial state.  In case of a window based congestion control
      like the one specified in [RFC4960], this means setting the
      congestion window and slow start threshold to its initial values.

6.2.  Padding Extension

   The padding extension defined in [RFC4820] MUST be supported and used
   for probe packets when performing path MTU discovery as specified in
   [RFC4821] by the SCTP layer.

6.3.  Dynamic Address Reconfiguration Extension

   If the dynamic address reconfiguration extension defined in [RFC5061]
   is used, only wildcard addresses MUST be used in ASCONF chunks.

6.4.  SCTP Authentication Extension

   The SCTP authentication extension defined in [RFC4895] can be used
   with DTLS encapsulation, but does not provide any additional benefit.

6.5.  Partial Reliability Extension

   Partial reliability as defined in [RFC3758] can be used in
   combination with DTLS encapsulation.  It is also possible to use
   additional PR-SCTP policies, for example the ones defined in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-prpolicies].

6.6.  Stream Reset Extension

   The SCTP stream reset extension defined in [RFC6525] can be used with
   DTLS encapsulation.  It is used to reset SCTP streams and add SCTP
   streams during the lifetime of the SCTP association.

6.7.  Interleaving of Large User Messages

   SCTP as defined in [RFC4960] does not support the interleaving of
   large user messages that need to be fragmented and reassembled by the
   SCTP layer.  The protocol extension defined in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-ndata] overcomes this limitation and can be used
   with DTLS encapsulation.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no actions from IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for DTLS are specified in [RFC4347] and for
   SCTP in [RFC4960], [RFC3758], and [RFC6525].  The combination of SCTP
   and DTLS introduces no new security considerations.

   SCTP should not process the IP addresses used for the underlying
   communication since DTLS provides no guarantees about them.

   It should be noted that the inability to process ICMP or ICMPv6
   messages does not add any security issue.  The processing of these
   messages for SCTP carried over a connection-less lower layer like IP,
   IPv6 or UDP is required to protect nodes not supporting SCTP.  Since
   DTLS provides a connection-oriented lower layer, this kind of
   protection is not necessary.
