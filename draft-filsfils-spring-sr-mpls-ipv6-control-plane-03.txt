1.  Introduction

   This document reminds the existence of the "Segment Routing (SR) MPLS
   dataplane with IPv6 control-plane".  This solution is mature from a
   standardization, productization and commercial deployment viewpoint.
   Other proposed source routing solutions with MPLS-like label lookup
   or mapping ids should list all their data-plane and control-plane
   differences with respect to this mature solution and should justify
   these differences with genuine benefits not available in the mature
   solution described in this document and others referenced here that
   are published by the SPRING and MPLS WGs.

2.  Context

   This is an existing solution.

   o  Mature IETF standardization

   o  Mature productization

   o  Commercially deployed

   The IETF standardization references are:

   o  Architecture:

      *  Segment Routing [RFC8402]

   o  Data-plane:

      *  Homogenous MPLS deployment: [RFC8660]

      *  Hopping over IP-only parts of network: [RFC8663]

   o  Control-plane:

     Figure 2: Packet processing in IPv6 network with SR-MPLS islands

   o  PE1 receives IPv4 traffic from A and headed to B

   o  PE1 PUSHes the VPN label 12345 and the prefix-SID 16002 of PE2

   o  Traffic is steered in MPLS island 1 according to the top label
      16002

   o  Traffic reaches node 121, whose next-hop towards 16002 is not
      MPLS-enabled

      *  Node 121 has determined(*) that traffic to 16002 should be sent
         over an IPv6 encapsulation to node 231

      *  Node 121 encapsulates the traffic with IPv6 header (Next Header
         137 [RFC4023]) to 2001:db8::231

   o  Node 231 removes the IPv6 encapsulation, exposes the MPLS label
      16002 and forwards the traffic accordingly

   o  Traffic is steered in MPLS island 2 according to the top label
      16002

   o  (PHP: Penultimate node POPs label 16002 and sends the traffic to
      PE2)

   o  PE2 looks up the exposed VPN label 12345 and forwards the traffic
      accordingly.

   (*) Node 121 determines that node 231 is the closest MPLS- and IPv6-
   pop-capable node on the shortest path to PE2 using a technique
   outside the scope of the document.
