Abstract

   This document proposes additions to the Domain-based Message
   Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) Tag Registry to
   enable Mail administrators to specify the domain-wide policies for S/
   MIME and PGP key usage in their mail domains, in conjunction with use
   of the DANE SMIMEA and OPENPGPKEY resource records.  This would mean
   adding to the authentication mechanisms specified in RFC 7489, but it
   would specify only the domain-wide policies for S/MIME and PGP, such
   as what the policies are for signing and encrypting (does the sender
   mandate it, not allow it, etc.).  This document also suggests the
   specification of the type of encoding of the left-hand sides used in
   the DANE resource records.

1.  Introduction

   This document proposes additions to the Domain-based Message
   Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) [RFC7489] Tag
   Registry to enable Mail administrators to specify the domain-wide
   policies for S/MIME and PGP key usage in their mail domains, in
   conjunction with use of the DANE SMIMEA [I-D.ietf-dane-smime] and
   OPENPGPKEY [I-D.ietf-dane-openpgpkey] resource records.  This would
   mean adding to the authentication mechanisms specified in RFC 7489,
   but it would specify only the domain-wide policies for Secure/
   Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) [RFC5751] and PGP,
   such as what the policies are for signing and encrypting (does the
   sender mandate it, not allow it, etc.).  This document also suggests
   the specification of the type of encoding of the left-hand sides used
   in the DANE resource records.

   DMARC is aimed to "express domain-level policies and preferences for
   message validation, disposition, and reporting that mail-receiving
   organizations can use to improve mail handling." [RFC7489].  In
   addition, consumption of DMARC records is primarily aimed at
   receiving SMTP server.  Consideration for including S/MIME is
   discussed in [RFC7489] Appendix A.1.  There, the document lists
   several reasons why S/MIME was not a proper fit for DMARC, initially.
   However, with recent work in the DANE working group on an SMIMEA DNS

   RR type, the previous obstacles for broad S/MIME deployment have
   either disappeared, or are now surmountable.

   Previous concerns for incorporating S/MIME into DMARC include:

   o  The previous implicit requirements for a "heavyweight ... PKI" are
      now obviated by DANE's use of DNS [RFC1035] and the DNS Security
      Extension (DNSSEC) [RFC4035].

   o  Deployment of DANE's SMIMEA record will operationally benefit from
      the additions proposed in this document, and this directly
      addresses the previous concern that incorporating S/MIME semantics
      into DMARC "would neither cause nor enable a substantial increase
      in the accuracy of the overall mechanism."

   o  Finally, DMARC focuses on "authentication at the domain level,"
      but recent work in the DANE working group has raised the issue
      that domain-level policies (including LHS encoding and
      canonicalization) are domain level policies that need to be
      learned by receiving side domains in order to learn S/MIME keys
      for users.  Senders must learn their receivers' policies for
      encryption and receivers must learn senders' policies in order to
      properly perform signature verification.

   The enhancements added by this document (as additions to DMARC's
   "DMARC Tag Registry") are to enable S/MIME (and Open PGP) with DANE,
   and will allow:

   o  Mail senders to have an option to ingest DMARC records (whereas
      before, DMARC was primarily focused on the mail receiver).  Mail
      senders will now, optionally, be able to ascertain:

      *  What (if any) are the signing or encryption requirements of a
         domain?

      *  What is the encoding technique for LHS portions of an email
         address?

      *  What is the canonicalization policy of LHS portions of email
         addresses in a domain?

   o  Mail receivers to learn:

      *  Does a sending domain have any mandatory signing or encryption
         rules for outbound emails?

      *  What is the encoding technique for LHS portions of an email
         address?

      *  What is the canonicalization policy of LHS portions of email
         addresses in a domain?

1.1.  Record Locators

   The per-user records such as SMIMEA and OPENPGPKEY specify that the
   LHS of an email address be encoded so that it can be used to locate
   an RR published for a specific user.  Some domains may opt for hashed
   labels (such as SHA224), some may opt for Base32 encoded labels, etc.
   In addition, specifying the canonicalization of case for LHS lookups
   ensures that mail domains can choose how to encode the LHS and how
   Mail User Agents (MUAs) can learn this.  An MUA MUST query the DNS
   for an SMIMEA or OPENPGPKEY record using the canonicalization and
   encoding policy in the DMARC records for the domain.  For example, a
   mail address like "JSmith@example.com" can be down-cased and SHA224
   hashed to become:
   "b7b7da967f26e6ee45e4eeb92ce64cd126a39635c83e8ac6c3f68649", and MUAs
   must be able to learn these domain-level conventions.

   The LHS of the email address in the RFC5322.From field is used to
   locate the SMIMEA or OPENPGPKEY record that provides signing keys.

   The reason that canonicalization and encoding policy discovery is
   important for senders and receivers is because there is considerable
   debate regarding which algorithms for canonicalization and encoding
   of the LHS of email addresses should be used to construct the labels
   that comprise the domain name of a RR.  Some large email providers
   have chosen to implement canonicalization that is not consistent with
   the standard.

   Using the additions to DMARC described in this document a domain may
   publish its canonicalization algorithm which will allow accurate
   construction of the labels for a record corresponding to a specific
   email address.

   Domains which choose to encode the LHS of a canonicalized email
   address may prefer a hash rather than a simple encoding to address
   privacy concerns, inhibit zone walking, or for other reasons.  The
   additions in this document provide a means for a domain to publish an
   encoding algorithm, which will allow mail receivers and senders to
   accurately construct the labels for a record corresponding to a
   specific email address.

1.2.  MUA Awareness

   The previous specification of DMARC is almost entirely relevant to
   the MTA and transparent to the end user.  The additions in this
   document are also relevant to the MUA, even though an MTA/MDA may use

Internet-Draft          DMARC Extensions for DANE           January 2016


   the policy published in a DMARC record using these new tags, For
   example a mail user who composes a message can be warned that the
   domain to which the message is directed requires that all messages be
   signed by the sender.

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Registry Additions

   This document outlines six types of domain-level policies that MAY be
   needed by either sender mail domains or receiver mail domains: 1)
   DANE LHS Encoding: "danelhse", 2) DANE LHS Canonicalization:
   "danelhsc", 3) DANE Receiving-side Signing Policy: "danersp", 4) DANE
   Receiving-side Encryption Policy: "danerep", 5) DANE Sending-side
   Signing Policy: "danessp", and 6) DANE Sending-side Encryption
   Policy: "danesep".

   As specified in [RFC7489], DMARC follows the extensible "tag-value"
   syntax.

   o  "danelhse": (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "L0".)  Indicates
      how an email address is encoded in the corresponding label in DNS.
      The value is a concatenation of 'F' (LHS with domain) or 'L' (LHS
      only) which indicates whether the domain part is included in the
      encoding.  Valid values are:

         F0: Truncated SHA256, [RFC4846], LHS and domain

         F1: SHA224, LHS and domain

         F2: Base32, [RFC4648], LHS and domain

         L0: Truncated SHA256, [RFC4846], LHS only

         L1: SHA224, LHS only

         L2: Base32, [RFC4648], LHS only

   o  "danelhsc": (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "lc".)  Indicates
      how the LHS component of email addresses in the domain are
      canonicalized before being encoded.  Valid values are:

         lc: Lower case




Osterweil & Wiley         Expires July 22, 2016                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          DMARC Extensions for DANE           January 2016


         uc: Upper case

         lcid: Lower case, ignore dots (as in some very large email
         service providers)

         none: No canonicalization rules are implemented, domain-wide.

   o  "danersp": (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "optional") Indicates
      what (if any) requirements a receiving domain has on whether email
      SHOULD be signed in order to be accepted.  Valid values are:

         required: Emails MUST be signed

         optional: Emails MAY be signed

         forbidden: Emails MUST NOT be signed

      The signing policy indicated by this tag refers to signing using
      (for example) SMIMEA or OPENPGPKEY records associated with the
      sender's email address in the domain.

   o  "danerep": (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "optional") Indicates
      what (if any) requirements a receiving domain has on whether email
      SHOULD be encrypted in order to be accepted.  Valid values are:

         required: Emails MUST be encrypted

         optional: Emails MAY be encrypted

         forbidden: Emails MUST NOT be encrypted

   o  "danessp": (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "optional") Indicates
      what (if any) requirements a sending domain has on whether a
      receiving domain SHOULD consider email originating from the
      sending domain legitimate.  Valid values are:

         required: Emails MUST be signed

         optional: Emails MAY be signed

         forbidden: Emails MUST NOT be signed

      The signing policy indicated by this tag refers to signing using
      SMIMEA or OPENPGPKEY records associated with the sender's email
      address in the domain.

   o  "danesep": (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "optional") Indicates
      what (if any) requirements a sending domain has on whether a

      receiving domain SHOULD consider email originating from the
      sending domain legitimate.  Valid values are:

         required: Emails MUST be encrypted

         optional: Emails MAY be encrypted

         forbidden: Emails MUST NOT be encrypted

2.1.  Formal Definition

   The formal definition of the tag-values above, using Section 2.1 is:

      danelhse ::= [ <F> | <L> ] + [ <0> | <1> | <2> ]

      danelhsc ::= <uc> | <lc> | <lcid> | <none>

      danersp ::= <required> | <optional> | <forbidden>

      danerep ::= <required> | <optional> | <forbidden>

      danessp ::= <required> | <optional> | <forbidden>

      danesep ::= <required> | <optional> | <forbidden>

3.  Examples

   These examples explore some permutations of the additions in this
   document but do not explore the uses of tags already present in
   DMARC.  The existing policy tags are not relevant but are included
   for context.

   In the following example TXT record, the domain has published a
   policy indicating that email addresses used to locate SMIMEA or
   OPENPGPKEY records should be converted to lower case and then the LHS
   and domain are encoded using base32.

      "v=DMARC1; p=none; danelhsc=lc; danelhse=F2;
      rua=mailto:postmaster@example.com; "

   In the following example TXT record, the domain has published a
   policy indicating that messages sent to the domain must be signed by
   the sender.

      "v=DMARC1; p=none; danersp=required;
      rua=mailto:postmaster@example.com; "

4.  Benefits

   These additions give mail administrators semantics to address
   policies around how their domains should handle email with (for
   example) S/MIME protections.  They also remove guesswork around how
   mail domains should handle DANE key learning.

   By recognizing the current approach to canonicalization by large
   scale email implementations these additions make it possible to
   accommodate existing widely deployed policies.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes a request to IANA to update the IANA sub-registry
   called "DMARC Tag Registry".  The sub-registry will need new
   "current" tags
