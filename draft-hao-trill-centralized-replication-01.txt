Abstract

   In TRILL active-active access scenario, RPF check failure issue may
   occur when pseudo-nickname mechanism in [TRILLPN] is used. This
   draft describes a solution to the RPF check failure issue through
   centralized replication for BUM (Broadcast, Unknown unicast,
   Mutlicast) traffic. The solution has all ingress RBs send BUM
   traffic to a centralized node via unicast TRILL encapsulation. When
   the centralized node receives the BUM traffic, it decapsulates the

   traffic and forwards the BUM traffic to all destination RBs using a
   distribution tree established via the TRILL base protocol. To avoid
   RPF check failure on a RBridge sitting between the ingress RBridge
   and the centralized replication node, some change of RPF calculation
   algorithm is required. RPF calculation on each RBridge should use
   the centralized node as ingress RB instead of the real ingress
   RBridge of RBv to perform the calculation.

1. Introduction

   The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
   [RFC6325] protocol provides loop free and per hop based multipath
   data forwarding with minimum configuration. TRILL uses IS-IS
   [RFC6165] [RFC6326bis] as its control plane routing protocol and
   defines a TRILL specific header for user data.

   Classic Ethernet device (CE) devices typically are multi-homed to
   multiple edge RBridges which form an edge group. All of the uplinks
   of CE are bundled as a Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation (MC-LAG). An
   active-active flow-based load sharing mechanism is normally
   implemented to achieve better load balancing and high reliability. A
   CE device can be a layer 3 end system by itself or a bridge switch
   through which layer 3 end systems access to TRILL campus.

   In active-active access scenario, pseudo-nickname solution in
   [TRILLPN] can be used to avoid MAC flip-flop on remote RBs. The
   basic idea is to use a virtual RBridge of RBv with a single pseudo-
   nickname to represent an edge group that MC-LAG connects to. Any
   member RBridge of that edge group should use this pseudo-nickname
   rather than its own nickname as ingress nickname when it injects
   TRILL data frames to TRILL campus. The use of the nickname solves
   the address flip flop issue by making the MAC address learnt by the
   remote RBridge bound to pseudo-nickname. However, it introduces
   another issue, which is incorrect packet drop by RPF check failure.
   Due to edge RBridges which use a pseudo-nickname other than own
   nicknames as the ingress nickname (Eg. Nick-Y) when the RBbridge
   forwards BUM traffic from local CE, the traffic will be treated by
   an RBridge (RBn) sitting between the ingress RB and distribution
   tree root as traffic whose ingress point is the virtual RBridge of
   RBv. If same distribution tree is used by these different edge
   RBridges, the traffic may arrive at RBn from different ports. Then
   the RPF check fails, and some of the traffic receiving from
   unexpected ports will be dropped by RBn.

   This document proposes a centralized replication solution for
   broadcast, unknown unicast, multicast(BUM) traffic to solve the
   issue of incorrect packet drop by RPF check failure. The basic idea
   is that all ingress RBs send BUM traffic to a centralized node which
   is recommended to be a distribution tree root using unicast TRILL
   encapsulation. When the centralized node receives that traffic, it
   decapsulates it and then forwards the BUM traffic to all destination
   RBs using a distribution tree established as per TRILL base protocol.

3. Centralized Replication Solution Overview

   When an edge RB receives BUM traffic from a CE device, it acts as
   ingress RB and uses unicast TRILL encapsulation instead of multicast
   TRILL encapsulation to send the traffic to a centralized node. The
   centralized node is recommended to be a distribution tree root.

   The TRILL header of the unicast TRILL encapsulation contains an
   "ingress RBridge nickname" field and an "egress RBridge nickname"
   field. If ingress RB receives the traffic from the port which is in
   a MC-LAG, it should set the ingress RBridge nickname to be the
   pseudo-nickname to avoid MAC flip-flop on remote RBs as per
   [TRILLPN]. Otherwise the ingress nickname should be set to ingress
   RBridge's own nickname. The egress RBridge nickname is set to the
   special nickname of the centralized node which is used to
   differentiate the unicast TRILL encapsulation BUM traffic from
   normal unicast TRILL traffic.

   When the centralized node receives the unicast TRILL encapsulated
   BUM traffic from ingress RB, the node decapsulates the packet. Then
   the centralized node replicates and forwards the BUM traffic to all
   destination RBs using one of the distribution trees established as
   per TRILL base protocol, if the centralized node is the root of a
   distribution tree, the recommended distribution tree is the tree
   whose root is the centralized node itself. When the centralized node
   forwards the BUM traffic, ingress nickname remains the same as that
   in frame it received to ensure that the MAC address learnt by all
   egress RBridges bound to pseudo-nickname.

   When the multicast traffic is forwarded on each RBridge along the
   distribution tree starting from the centralized node, RPF check will
   be performed as per RFC6325. For any RBridge sitting between the
   ingress RBridge and the centralized replication node, the traffic
   incoming port should be the centralized node facing port as the
   multicast traffic always comes from the centralized node in this
   solution. However the RPF port as result of distribution tree
   calculation as per RFC 6325 will be the real ingress RB facing port
   as it uses virtual RBridge as ingress RB, so RPF check will fail. To
   solve this problem, some change of RPF calculation algorithm is
   required. RPF calculation on each RBridge should use the centralized
   node as ingress RB instead of the real ingress virtual RBridge to
   perform the calculation. As a result, RPF check will point to the
   centralized node facing port on the RBridge for multi-destination
   traffic. It prevents the incorrect frame discard by RPF check.

   To differentiate the unicast TRILL encapsulation BUM traffic from
   normal unicast TRILL traffic on a centralized node, besides the

   centralized node's own nickname, a special nickname should be
   introduced for centralized replication. Only when the centralized
   node receives unicast TRILL encapsulation traffic with egress
   nickname equivalent to the special nickname, the node does unicast
   TRILL decapsulaton and then forwards the traffic to all destination
   RBs through a distribution tree. The centralized nodes should
   announce its special use nickname to all TRILL campus through TRILL
   LSP extension.

4. Frame duplication from remote RB

   Frame duplication may occur when a remote host sends multi-
   destination frame to a local CE which has an active-active
   connection to the TRILL campus. To avoid local CE receiving multiple
   copies from a remote RBridge, the designated forwarder (DF)
   mechanism should be supported for egress direction multicast traffic.

   DF election mechanism allows only one port in one RB of MC-LAG to
   forward multicast traffic from TRILL campus to local access side for
   each VLAN. The basic idea of DF is to elect one RBridge per VLAN
   from an edge group to be responsible for egressing the multicast
   traffic. [draft-hao-trill-dup-avoidance-active-active-02] describes
   the detail DF mechanism and TRILL protocol extension for DF election.

   If DF-election mechanism is used for frame duplication prevention,
   access ports on an RB are categorized as three types: non mc-lag,
   mc-lag DF port and mc-lag non-DF port. The last two types can be
   called mc-lag port. For each of the mc-lag port, there is a pseudo-
   nickname associated. If consistent nickname allocation per edge
   group RBridges is used, it is possible that same pseudo-nickname
   associated to more than one port on a single RB. A typical scenario
   is that CE1 is connected to RB1 & RB2 by mc-lag1 while CE2 is
   connected to RB1 & RB2 by mc-lag 2. In order to save the number of
   pseudo-nickname used, member ports for both mc-lag1 and mc-lag2 on
   RB1 & RB2 are all associated to pseudo-nickname pn1.

5. Local forwarding behavior on ingress RBridge

   When a ingress RBridge(RB1) receives BUM traffic from an active-
   active accessing CE(CE1) device, the traffic will be injected to
   TRILL campus through TRILL encapsulation, and it will be replicated
   and forwarded to all destination RBs which include ingress RB itself
   along a TRILL distribution tree. So the traffic will return to the
   ingress RBridge. To avoid the traffic looping back to original
   sender CE, ingress nickname can be used for traffic filtering.

Internet-Draft Centralized replication for BUM traffic        May 2014


   If there are two local connecting CE(CE1 and CE2) devices on ingress
   RB, the BUM traffic between these two CEs can't be forwarded locally
   and through TRILL campus simultaneously, otherwise duplicated
   traffic will be received by destination CE. Local forwarding
   behavior on ingress RBridge should be carefully designed.

   To avoid duplicated traffic on receiver CE, local replication
   behavior on RB1 is as follows:

   1. Local replication to the ports associated with the same pseudo-
   nickname as that associated to the incoming port as per RFC6325.

   2. Do not replicate to mc-lag port associated with different pseudo-
   nickname.

   3. Do not replicate to non mc-lag ports.

   The above local forwarding behavior on the ingress RB of RB1 can be
   called centralized local forwarding behavior A.

   If ingress RB of RB1 itself is the centralized node, BUM traffic
   injected to TRILL campus won't loop back to RB1. In this case, the
   local forwarding behavior is called centralized local forwarding
   behavior B. The local replication behavior on RB1 is as follows:

   1. Local replication to non mc-lag ports as per RFC6325.

   2. Local replication to the ports associated with the same pseudo-
   nickname as that associated to the incoming port as per RFC6325.

   3. Local replication to the mc-lag DF port associated with different
   pseudo-nickname as per RFC6325. Do not replicate to mc-lag non-DF
   port associated with different pseudo-nickname.

6. Loop prevention among RBridges in a edge group

   If a CE sends a broadcast, unknown unicast, or multicast (BUM)
   packet through DF port to a ingress RB, it will forward that packet
   to all or subset of the other RBs that only have non-DF ports for
   that MC-LAG. Because BUM traffic forwarding to non-DF port isn't
   allowed, in this case the frame won't loop back to the CE.

   If a CE sends a BUM packet through non-DF port to a ingress RB, say
   RB1, then RB1 will forward that packet to other RBridges that have
   DF port for that MC-LAG. In this case the frame will loop back to
   the CE and traffic split-horizon filtering mechanism should be used
   to avoid looping back among RBridges in a edge group.

   Split-horizon mechanism relies on ingress nickname to check if a
   packet's egress port belongs to a same MC-LAG with the packet's
   incoming port to TRILL campus.

   When the ingress RBridge receives BUM traffic from an active-active
   accessing CE device, the traffic will be injected to TRILL campus
   through TRILL encapsulation, and it will be replicated and forwarded
   to all destination RBs which include ingress RB itself through TRILL
   distribution tree. If same pseudo-nickname is used for two active-
   active access CEs as ingress nickname, egress RB can use the
   nickname to filter traffic forwarding to all local CE. In this case,
   the traffic between these two CEs goes through local RB and another
   copy of the traffic from TRILL campus is filtered. If different
   ingress nickname is used for two connecting CE devices, the access
   ports connecting to these two CEs should be isolated with each other.
   The BUM traffic between these two CEs should go through TRILL campus,
   otherwise the destination CE connected to same RB with the sender CE
   will receive two copies of the traffic.

   Assuming the centralized replication solution is used in the network
   of above figure 1, RB5 is the distribution tree root and centralized

   replication node, CE1 and CE2 are active-active accessed to RB1,RB2
   and RB3 through MC-LAG1 and MC-LAG2 respectively, CE3 is single
   homed to RB3. The RBridge's own nickname of RB1 to RB5 are nick1 to
   nick5 respectively. RB1,RB2 and RB3 use same pseudo-nickname for MC-
   LAG1 and MC-LAG2, the pseudo-nickname is P-nick. The special use
   nickname on the centralized replication node of RB5 is S-nick.

   The BUM traffic forwarding process from CE1 to CE2,CE3 is as follows:

   1. CE1 sends BUM traffic to RB3.

   2. RB3 replicates and sends the BUM traffic to CE2 locally. RB2 also
      sends the traffic to RB5 through unicast TRILL encapsulation.
      Ingress nickname is set as P-nick, egress nickname is set as S-
      nick.

   3. RB5 decapsulates the unicast TRILL packet. Then it uses the
      distribution tree whose root is RB5 to forward the packet. The
      egress nickname in the trill header is the nick5. Ingress
      nickname is still P-nick.

   4. RB4 receives multicast TRILL traffic from RB5. Traffic incoming
      port is the up port facing to distribution tree root, RPF check
      will be correct based on the changed RPF port calculation
      algorithm in this document. After RFC check is performed, it
      forwards the traffic to all other egress RBs(RB1,RB2 and RB3).

   5. RB3 receives multicast TRILL traffic from RB4. It decapsulates
      the multicast TRILL packet. Because ingress nickname of P-nick is
      equivalent to the nickname of local MC-LAGs connecting CE1 and
      CE2, it doesn't forward the traffic to CE1 and CE2 to avoid
      duplicated frame. RB3 only forwards the packet to CE3.

   6. RB1 and RB2 receive multicast TRILL traffic from RB4. The
      forwarding process is similar to the process on RB3, i.e, because
      ingress nickname of P-nick is equivalent to the nickname of local
      MC-LAGs connecting CE1 and CE2, they also don't forward the
      traffic to local CE1 and CE2.

8. BUM traffic loadbalancing among multiple centralized nodes

   To support unicast TRILL encapsulation BUM traffic load balancing,
   multiple centralized replication node can be deployed and the
   traffic can be load balanced on these nodes in vlan-based or flow-
   based mode.

Internet-Draft Centralized replication for BUM traffic        May 2014


8.1. Vlan-based loadbalancing

   Assuming there are k centralized nodes in TRILL campus, VLAN-
   based(or FGL-based, etc) loadbalancing algorithm used by ingress
   active-active access RBridge is as follows:

      1. All centralized nodes are ordered and numbered from 0 to k-1

      in ascending order according to the 7-octet IS-IS ID.

      2. For VLAN ID m, choose the centralized node whose number equals
   (m mod k).

   An example of the m mod K, is that for 3 centralized nodes (CN) and
   5 VLANs is: VLAN 0 goes to CN0, VLAN1 goes to CN1, VLAN2 goes to CN2,
   VLAN4 goes to CN0, and VLAN5 goes to CN1.

   When a ingress RBridge participating active-active connection
   receives BUM traffic from local CE, the RB decides to send the
   traffic to which centralized node based on the VLAN-based
   loadbalancing algorithm, vlan-based loadbalancing for the BUM
   traffic can be achieved among multiple centralized nodes.

8.2. Flow-based loadbalancing

   To support flow-based loadbalancing for BUM traffic between
   different centralized node, anycast special use nickname mechanism
   should be introduced, which means a same special use nickname is
   attached to both physical centralized node at the same time. Each
   centralized node announces the special use nickname through the
   Nickname Sub-Tlv specified in [RFC6326] to TRILL network and MUST
   ignore the nickname collision check as defined in basic TRILL
   protocol.

   The egress nickname of unicast TRILL encapsulation for BUM traffic
   from ingress RB is the special use nickname. The unicast TRILL
   encapsulation BUM traffic would go to any one of the physical
   centralized nodes by the natural support of ECMP from TRILL protocol.

   The physical centralized node will decapsulate the unicast TRILL
   encapsulation and forwards it through any one of the distribution
   trees established per RFC 6325 with the original source, and BUM
   destination. Because ECMP of the unicast TRILL encapsulation BUM
   traffic is supported among multiple centralized nodes, so it can
   achieve better link bandwidth usage than VLAN-based(or FGL-based,
   etc)loadbalancing.

Internet-Draft Centralized replication for BUM traffic        May 2014


9. Network Migration Analysis

   Centralized nodes need software and hardware upgrade to support
   centralized replication process, which stitches TRILL unicast
   traffic decapsulation process and the process of normal TRILL
   multicast traffic forwarding along distribution tree.

   Active-active connection edge RBs need software and hardware upgrade
   to support unicast TRILL encapsulation for BUM traffic, the process
   is similar to normal head-end replication process.

   Transit nodes need software upgrade to support RPF port calculation
   algorithm change.

10. TRILL protocol extension

   The Unicast BUM Nickname TLV is introduced to announce its special
   use nickname for centralized replication by centralized node. It is
   carried in an LSP PDU. Ingress RBs rely on the TLV to learn the
   egress nickname of TRILL unicast encapsulation for BUM traffic.

10.1. The Unicast BUM Nickname sub-TLV

              +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
              |   Type        | (1 byte)
              +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
              |   Length      | (1 byte)
              +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+
              |  Uni BUM Nickname      |  (4 bytes)
              +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+|
         o Type: Router Capability sub-TLV type, TBD (Uni-BUM-VLANs).

         o Length: indicates the length of Uni BUM Nickname field, it
   is a fixed value of 4.

         o Uni BUM Nickname: The nickname is exclusively used for
   centralized replication solution purpose. Ingress RBs use the
   nickname as egress nickname in trill header of unicast TRILL
   encapsulation for BUM traffic.

11. Security Considerations

   This draft does not introduce any extra security risks. For general
   TRILL Security Considerations, see [RFC6325].
