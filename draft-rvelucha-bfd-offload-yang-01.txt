                   draft-rvelucha-bfd-offload-yang-01

Abstract

   This document defines a extension YANG data model that can be used to
   manage Hardware Offloaded Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD).

   This document specially talks about BFD sessions that are offloaded
   to hardware.

   The YANG modules in this document conform to the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA).

1.  Introduction

   This document defines an extension YANG data model to base model
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang] that can be used to manage BFD sessions that are
   offloaded to hardware.  BFD is a network protocol which is used for
   liveness detection of arbitrary paths between systems.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119]
   [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown
   here.

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   This document uses the graphical representation of data models
   defined in [RFC8340].

2.  Design of the Data Model

   This yang model which is extension to base BFD yang mode been
   designed to manage BFD HW offloaded sessions.  This new "bfd"
   container is augmented by all the YANG modules for their respective
   specific information:

Internet-Draft                  BFD YANG                    January 2022


   1.  ietf-bfd-ip-sh-ext.yang augments "/routing/control-plane-
       protocols/control-plane-protocol/bfd/ip-sh/sessions/session" with
       the "ip-sh-ext" container for BFD sessions over IP single-hop
       extension.

3.  BFD IP single-hop-ext hierarchy

   An "ip-sh-ext" node is added under "bfd" node in control-plane-
   protocol.  The operational state data for each BFD IP single-hop
   session is under this "ip-sh-ext" node.


   module: ietf-bfd-ip-sh-ext
   augment /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols
            /rt:control-plane-protocol/bfd:bfd/bfd-ip-sh:ip-sh

       +--rw ip-sh-ext
          +--ro session-running-ext
             +--ro session-offloaded?   boolean


4.  BFD IP single-hop ext YANG Module

   This YANG module imports "ietf-bfd-ip-sh" from RFCXXX and augments.
