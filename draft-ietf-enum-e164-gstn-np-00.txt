1. Abstract

   This document provides an overview of E.164 telephone number
   portability (NP) in the Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN).
   There are three types of number portability: service provider number
   portability (SPNP), location portability, and service portability.
   Service provider portability, the focus of the present draft, is a
   regulatory imperative in many countries seeking to liberalize local
   telephony service competition, by enabling end-users to retain pre-
   existing telephone numbers while changing service providers.
   Implementation of NP within national GSTN entails potentially
   significant changes to numbering administration, network element
   signaling, call routing and processing, billing, service management,
   and other functions.  NP changes the fundamental nature of a dialed
   E.164 number from a hierarchical physical routing address to a
   virtual address, thereby requiring the transparent translation of
   the later to the former.  In addition, there are various regulatory

   constraints which establish relevant parameters for NP
   implementation, most of which are not network technology specific.
   Consequently, the implementation of NP behavior consistent with
   applicable regulatory constraints, as well as the need for
   interoperation with the existing GSTN NP implementations, are
   relevant topics for numerous areas of IP telephony work-in-progress

2. Introduction

   This document provides an overview of E.164 telephone number
   portability in the Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN).  There
   are considered to be three types of number portability (NP): service
   provider portability (SPNP), location portability (not to be
   confused with terminal mobility), and service portability.

   Service provider portability (SPNP), the focus of the present draft,
   is a regulatory imperative in many countries seeking to liberalize
   telephony service competition, especially local service.
   Historically, local telephony service (as compared to long distance
   or international service) has been regulated as a utility-like form
   of service.  While a number of countries had begun liberalization
   (e.g. privatization, de-regulation, or re-regulation) some years
   ago, the advent of NP is relatively recent (since ~1995).

   E.164 numbers can be non-geographic and geographic numbers.  Non-
   geographic numbers do not reveal the locations information of those
   numbers.  Geographic E.164 numbers were intentionally designed as
   hierarchical routing addresses which could systematically be digit-
   analyzed to ascertain the country, serving network provider, serving
   end-office switch, and specific line of the called party.  As such,
   without NP a subscriber wishing to change service providers would
   incur a number change as a consequence of being served off of a
   different end-office switch operated by the new service provider.
   The cost and convenience impact to the subscriber of changing
   numbers is seen as barrier to competition.  Hence NP has become
   associated with GSTN infrastructure enhancements associated with a
   competitive environment driven by regulatory directives.

   Forms of SPNP have been deployed or are being deployed widely in the
   GSTN in various parts of the world, including the US, Canada,
   Western Europe, Australia, and the Pacific Rim (e.g. Hong Kong).
   Other regions, such as South America (e.g. Brazil) are actively
   considering it.

   Implementation of NP within a national telephony infrastructure
   entails potentially significant changes to numbering administration,
   network element signaling, call routing and processing, billing,
   service management, and other functions.

   NP changes the fundamental nature of a dialed E.164 number from a
   hierarchical physical routing address to a virtual address.  NP

   implementations attempt to encapsulate the impacts to the GSTN and
   make NP transparent to subscribers by incorporating a translation
   function to map a dialed, potentially ported E.164 address, into a
   network routing address (either a number prefix or another E.164
   address) which can be hierarchically routed.

   This is roughly analogous to the use of network address translation
   on IP addresses to enable IP address portability by containing the
   impact of the address change to the edge of the network and retain
   the use of CIDR blocks in the core which can be route aggregated by
   the network service provider to the rest of the internet.

   NP bifurcates the historical role of a subscriber∆s E.164 address
   into two or more data elements (a dialed or virtual address, and a
   network routing address) that must be made available to network
   elements through an NP translations database, carried by forward
   call signaling, and recorded on call detail records.  Not only is
   call processing and routing affected, but also so is SS7/C7
   messaging.  A number of TCAP-based SS7 messaging sets utilize an
   E.164 address as an application-level network element address in the
   global title address (GTA) field of the SCCP message header.
   Consequently, SS7/C7 signaling transfer points (STPs) and gateways
   need to be able to perform n-digit global title translation (GTT) to
   translate a dialed E.164 address into its network address
   counterpart via the NP database.

   In addition, there are various national regulatory constraints which
   establish relevant parameters for NP implementation, most of which
   are not network technology specific.  Consequently, implementations
   of NP behavior in IP telephony consistent with applicable regulatory
   constraints, as well as the need for interoperation with the
   existing GSTN NP implementations, are relevant topics for numerous
   areas of IP telephony work-in-progress at IETF.

   This document describes three types of number portability and the
   four schemes that have been standardized to support SPNP for
   geographic E.164 numbersspecifically.  Following that, specific
   information regarding the call routing and database query
   implementations are described for several regions (North American
   and Europe) and industries (wireless vs. wireline). The Number
   Portability Database (NPDB) interfaces and the call routing schemes
   that are used in the North America and Europe are described to show
   the variety of standards that may be implemented worldwide.  A
   glance of the NP implementations worldwide is provided.  Number
   pooling is briefly discussed to show how NP is being enhanced in the
   US to conserve North American area codes.  The conclusion briefly
   touches the potential impacts of NP on IP & Telecommunications
   Interoperability.  Appendix A provides some specific technical and
   regulatory information on NP in North America.  Appendix B describes
   the number portability administration process that manages the
   number portability database in North America.

4. Types of Number Portability

   As there are several types of E.164 numbers (telephone numbers, or
   just TN) in the GSTN, there are correspondingly several types of
   E.164 NP in the GSTN.  First there are so-call non-geographic E.164
   numbers, commonly used for service-specific applications such as
   freephone (800 or 0800).  Portability of these are call non-
   geographic number portability (NGNP).  NGNP, for example, was
   deployed in the US in 1986-92.

   Geographic number portability, which includes traditional fixed or
   wireline numbers as well as mobile numbers which are allocated out
   of geographic number range prefixes, is called NP or GNP or in the
   US local number portability (LNP).

   Number portability allows the telephony subscribers in the Global
   Switched Telephone Network (GSTN) to keep their phone numbers when
   they change their service providers or subscribed services, or when
   they move to a new location.

   The ability to change the service provider while keeping the same
   phone number is called service provider portability (SPNP) also
   known as "operator portability."

             Number Portability in the GSTN: An Overview      July 2000


   The ability to change the subscriber∆s fixed service location while
   keeping the same phone number is called location portability.

   The ability to change the subscribed services (e.g., from the plain
   old telephone service to Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
   services) while keeping the same phone number is called service
   portability.  Another aspect of service portability is to allow the
   subscribers to enjoy the subscribed services in the same way when
   they roam outside their home networks as is supported by the
   cellular/wireless networks.

   In addition, mobile number portability (MNP) refers to specific NP
   implementation in mobile networks either as part of a broader NP
   implementation in the GSTN or on a stand-alone basis.  Where
   interoperation of LNP and MNP is supported, service portability
   between fixed and mobile service types is possible.

   At present, SPNP has been the primary form of NP deployed due to its
   relevance in enabling local service competition.

   Also in use in the GSTN are the terms interim NP (INP or ILNP) and
   true NP.  Interim NP usually refers to the use of remote call
   forwarding-like measures to forward calls to ported numbers through
   the donor network to the new service network.  These are considered
   interim relative to true NP, which seeks to remove the donor network
   or old service provider from the call or signaling path altogether.
   Often the distinction between interim and true NP is a national
   regulatory matter relative to the technical/operational requirements
   imposed on NP in that country.

   Implementations of true NP in certain countries (e.g. US, Canada,
   Spain, Belgium, Denmark) may pose specific requirements for IP
   telephony implementations as a result of regulatory and industry
   requirements for providing call routing and signaling independent of
   the donor network or last previous serving network.


5. Service Provider Number Portability Schemes

   Four schemes can be used to support service provider portability and
   are briefly described below.  But first, some further terms are
   introduced.

   The donor network is the network that first assigned a telephone
   number (e.g., TN +1-202-533-1234) to a subscriber, out of a number
   range administratively (e.g., +1 202-533) assigned to it.  The
   current service provider (new SP) or new serving network is the
   network that currently serves the ported number. The old serving
   network (or old SP) is the network that previously served the ported
   number before the number was ported to the new serving network.
   Since a TN can port a number of times, the old SP is not necessarily
   the same as the donor network, except for the first time the TN
   ports away, or if the TN ports back into the donor network and away

             Number Portability in the GSTN: An Overview      July 2000


   again.  While the new SP and old SP roles are transitory as a TN
   ports around, the donor network is always the same for any
   particular TN based on the service provider to whom the subtending
   number range was administratively assigned.  See the discussion
   below on number pooling, as this enhancement to NP further
   bifurcates the role of donor network into two (the number range or
   code holder network, and the block holder network).

   To simplify the illustration, all the transit networks are ignored,
   the originating or donor network is the one that performs the
   database queries or call redirection, and the dialed directory
   number (TN) has been ported out of the donor network before.

   It is assumed that the old serving network, the new serving network
   and the donor network are different networks so as to show which
   networks are involved in call handling and routing and database
   queries in each of four schemes.  Please note that the port of the
   number (process of moving it from one network to another) happened
   prior to the call setup and is not included in the call steps.
   Information carried in the signaling messages to support each of the
   four schemes is not discussed to simplify the explanation.


5.1 All Call Query (ACQ)

   Figure 1 shows the call steps for the ACQ scheme.  Those call steps
   are as follows:

   (1) The Originating Network receives a call from the caller and
       sends a query to a centrally administered Number Portability
       Database (NPDB), a copy of which is usually resident on a
       network element within its network or through a third party
       provider.
   (2) The NPDB returns the routing number associated with the dialed
       directory number.  The routing number is discussed later in
       Section 7.
   (3) The Originating Network uses the routing number to route the
       call to the new serving network.

5.2 Query on Release (QoR)

  Figure 2 shows the call steps for the QoR scheme.  Those call steps
  are as follows:

   (1) The Originating Network receives a call from the caller and
       routes the call to the donor network.
   (2) The donor network releases the call and indicates that the
       dialed directory number has been ported out of that switch.
   (3) The Originating Network sends a query to its copy of the
       centrally administered NPDB.
   (4) The NPDB returns the routing number associated with the dialed
       directory number.
   (5) The Originating Network uses the routing number to route the
       call to the new serving network.

5.3 Call Dropback

  Figure 3 shows the call steps for the Dropback scheme.  This scheme
  is also known as "Return to Pivot (RTP)."  Those call steps are as
  follows:

   (1) The Originating Network receives a call from the caller and
       routes the call to the donor network.

   (2) The donor network detects that the dialed directory number has
       been ported out of the donor switch and checks with an internal
       network-specific NPDB.
   (3) The internal NPDB returns the routing number associated with the
       dialed directory number.
   (4) The donor network releases the call by providing the routing
       number.
   (5) The Originating Network uses the routing number to route the
       call to the new serving network.

5.4 Onward Routing (OR)

  Figure 4 shows the call steps for the OR scheme.  This scheme is also
  called Remote Call Forwarding.  Those call steps are as follows:

   (1) The Originating Network receives a call from the caller and
       routes the call to the donor network.
   (2) The donor network detects that the dialed directory number has
       been ported out of the donor switch and checks with an internal
       network-specific NPDB.
   (3) The internal NPDB returns the routing number associated with the
       dialed directory number.
   (4) The donor network uses the routing number to route the call to
       the new serving network.

5.5 Comparisons of the Four Schemes

   Only the ACQ scheme does not involve the donor network when routing
   the call to the new serving network of the dialed ported number.
   The other three schemes involve call setup to or signaling with the
   donor network.

   Only the OR scheme requires the setup of two physical call segments,
   one from the Originating Network to the donor network and the other
   from the donor network to the new serving network.  The OR scheme is
   the least efficient in terms of using the network resources.  The
   QoR and Dropback schemes set up calls to the donor network first but
   release the call back to the Originating Network that then initiates
   a new call to the Current Serving Network.  For the QoR and Dropback
   schemes, circuits are still reserved one by one between the
   Originating Network and the donor network when the Originating
   Network sets up the call towards the donor network.  Those circuits
   are released one by one when the call is released from the donor
   network back to the Originating Network.  The ACQ scheme is the most
   efficient in terms of using the switching and transmission
   facilities for the call.

   Both the ACQ and QoR schemes involve Centralized NPDBs for the
   Originating Network to retrieve the routing information.
   Centralized NPDB means that the NPDB contains ported number
   information from multiple networks.  This is in contrast to the
   internal network-specific NPDB that is used for the Dropback and OR
   schemes.  The internal NPDB only contains information about the
   numbers that were ported out of the donor network.  The internal
   NPDB can be a stand-alone database that contains information about
   all or some ported-out numbers from the donor network.  It can also
   reside on the donor switch and only contains information about those
   numbers ported out of the donor switch.  In that case, no query to a
   stand-alone internal NPDB is required.  The donor switch for a
   particular phone number is the switch to which the number range is
   assigned from which that phone number was originally assigned.

   For example, number ranges in the North American Numbering Plan
   (NANP) are usually assigned in the form of central office codes (CO
   codes) comprising a six-digit prefix formatted as a NPA+NXX.  Thus a
   switch serving +1-202-533 would typically serve +1-202-533-0000

<Foster,McGarry,Yu> Informational - Expiration in January 2001      10

             Number Portability in the GSTN: An Overview      July 2000


   through +1-202-533-9999. In major cities, switches usually host
   several CO codes.  NPA stands for Numbering Plan Area that is also
   known as the area code.  It is three-digit long and has the format
   of NXX where N is any digit from 2 to 9 and X is any digit from 0 to
   9.  NXX in the NPA+NXX format is known as the office code that has
   the same format as the NPA.  When the first number out of an NPA+NXX
   code is ported out to another switch, that NPA+NXX is called
   "portable NPA+NXX."

   Similarly, in other national E.164 numbering plans, number ranges
   cover a contiguous range of numbers within that range.  Once a
   number within that range has ported away from the donor network, all
   numbers in that range are considered potentially ported and should
   be queried in the NPDB.

   The ACQ scheme has two versions.  One version is for the Originating
   Network to always query the NPDB when a call is received from the
   caller regardless whether the dialed directory number is ported or
   not. The other version is to check whether the dialed directory
   number belongs to any portable number range.  If yes, an NPDB query
   is sent. If not, no NPDB query is sent.  The former performs better
   when there are many portable number ranges.  The latter performs
   better when there are not too many portable number ranges at the
   expense of checking every call to see whether NPDB query is needed.
   The latter ACQ scheme is similar to the QoR scheme except that the
   QoR scheme uses call setup and relies on the donor network to
   indicate "number ported out" before launching the NPDB query.


6. Database Queries in the NP Environment

   As indicated earlier, the ACQ and QoR schemes require that a switch
   query the NPDB for routing information.  Various standards have been
   defined for the switch-to-NPDB interface.  Those interfaces with
   their protocol stacks are briefly described below.  The term "NPDB"
   is used for a stand-alone database that may support just one or some
   or all of the interfaces mentioned below.  The NPDB query contains
   the dialed directory number and the NPDB response contains the
   routing number.  There are certainly other information that is sent
   in the query and response.  The primary interest is to get the
   routing number from the NPDB to the switch for call routing.


6.1 U.S. and Canada

   One of the following five NPDB interfaces can be used to query an
   NPDB:

   (a) Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) using the American National
       Standards Institute (ANSI)  version of the Intelligent Network
       Application Part (INAP) [ANSI SS] [ANSI DB].  The INAP is
       carried on top of the protocol stack that includes the (ANSI)
       Message Transfer Part (MTP) Levels 1 through 3, ANSI Signaling

<Foster,McGarry,Yu> Informational - Expiration in January 2001      11

             Number Portability in the GSTN: An Overview      July 2000


       Connection Control Part (SCCP), and ANSI Transaction
       Capabilities Application Part (TCAP).  This interface can be
       used by the wireline or wireless switches, is specific to the
       LRN implementation of LNP in North America, and is modeled on
       the Public Office Dialing Plan (PODP) trigger defined in the
       Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) 0.1 call model.

   (b) Intelligent Network (IN), which is similar to the one used for
       querying the 800 databases.  The IN protocol is carried on top
       of the protocol stack that includes the ANSI MTP Levels 1
       through 3, ANSI SCCP, and ANSI TCAP.  This interface can be used
       by the wireline or wireless switches.

   (c) ANSI IS-41 [IS41] [ISNP], which is carried on top of the
       protocol stack that includes the ANSI MTP Levels 1 through 3,
       ANSI SCCP, and ANSI TCAP.  This interface can be used by the IS-
       41 based cellular/Personal Communication Services (PCS) wireless
       switches (e.g., AMPS, TDMA and CDMA).  Cellular systems use
       spectrum at 800 MHz range and PCS systems use spectrum at 1900
       MHz range.

   (d) Global System for Mobile Communication Mobile Application Part
       (GSM MAP) [GSM], which is carried on top of the protocol stack
       that includes the ANSI MTP Levels 1 through 3, ANSI SCCP, and
       International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication Sector
       (ITU-TS) TCAP.  It can be used by the PCS1900 wireless switches
       that are based on the GSM technologies.  GSM is a series of
       wireless standards defined by the European Telecommunications
       Standards Institute (ETSI).

   (e) ISUP triggerless translation.  NP translations are performed
       transparently to the switching network by the signaling network
       (e.g. Signaling Transfer Points (STPs) or signaling gateways).
       ISUP IAM messages are examined to determine if the CdPN field
       has already been translated, and if not, an NPDB query is
       performed, and the appropriate parameters in the IAM message
       modified to reflect the results of the translation.   The
       modified IAM message is forwarded by the signaling node on to
       the designated DPC in a transparent manner to continue call
       setup.  The NPDB can be integrated with the signaling node or be
       accessed via an API locally or by a query to a remote NPDB using
       a proprietary protocol or the schemes described above.


   Wireline switches have the choice of using either (a), (b), or (e).
   IS-41 based wireless switches have the choice of using (a), (b),
   (c), or (e).  PCS1900 wireless switches have the choice of using
   (a), (b), (d), or (e). In the North America, service provider
   portability will be supported by both the wireline and wireless
   systems, not only within the wireline or wireless domain but also
   across the wireline/wireless boundary.  However, this is not true in
   Europe where service provider portability is usually supported only
   within the wireline or wireless domain, not across the

<Foster,McGarry,Yu> Informational - Expiration in January 2001      12

             Number Portability in the GSTN: An Overview      July 2000


   wireline/wireless boundary due to explicit use of service-specific
   number range prefixes.  The reason is to avoid caller confusion
   about the call charge. GSM systems in Europe are assigned
   distinctive destination network codes, and the caller pays a higher
   charge when calling a GSM directory number.


6.2 Europe

   One of the following three interfaces can be used to query an NPDB:

   (a) Capability Set 1 (CS1) of the ITU-TS INAP [CS1], which is
       carried on top of the protocol stack that includes the ITU-TS
       MTP Levels 1 through 3, ITU-TS SCCP, and ITU-TS TCAP.

   (b) Capability Set 2 (CS2) of the ITU-TS INAP [CS2], which is
       carried on top of the protocol stack that includes the ITU-TS
       MTP Levels 1 through ITU-TS MTP Levels 1 through 3, ITU-TS SCCP,
       and ITU-TS TCAP.

   (c) ISUP triggerless translation.  NP translations are performed
       transparently to the switching network by the signaling network
       (e.g. STPs or signaling gateways).  ISUP IAM messages are
       examined to determine if the CdPN field has already been
       translated, and if not, an NPDB query is performed, and the
       appropriate parameters in the IAM message modified to reflect
       the results of the translation.   The modified IAM message is
       forwarded by the signaling node on to the designated DPC in a
       transparent manner to continue call setup.


   Wireline switches have the choice of using either (a), (b), or (c);
   however, all the implementations in Europe so far are based on CS1.
   As indicated earlier that number portability in Europe does not go
   across the wireline/wireless boundary.  The wireless switches can
   also use (a) or (b) to query the NPDBs if those NPDBs contains
   ported wireless directory numbers.  The term "Mobile Number
   Portability (MNP)" is used for the support of service provider
   portability by the GSM networks in Europe.

   In most, if not all, cases in Europe, the calls to the wireless
   directory numbers are routed to the wireless donor network first.
   Over there, an internal NPDB is queried to determine whether the
   dialed wireless directory number has been ported out or not.  In
   this case, the interface to the internal NPDB is not subject to
   standardization.

   MNP in Europe can also be supported via MNP Signaling Relay Function
   (MNP-SRF).  Again, an internal NPDB or a database integrated at the
   MNP-SRF is used to modify the SCCP Called Party Address parameter in
   the GSM MAP messages so that they can be re-directed to the wireless
   serving network.   Call routing involving MNP will be explained in
   Section 7.2.

7. Call Routing in the NP Environment

   This section discusses the call routing after the routing
   information has been retrieved either through an NPDB query or an
   internal database lookup at the donor switch, or from the Integrated
   Services Digital Network User Part (ISUP) signaling message (e.g.,
   for the Dropback scheme).  For the ACQ, QoR and Dropback schemes, it
   is the Originating Network that has the routing information and is
   ready to route the call.  For the OR scheme, it is the donor network
   that has the routing information and is ready to route the call.

   A number of triggering schemes may be employed that determine where
   in the call path the NPDB query is performed.  In the US an ÙN-1ˆ
   policy is used, which essentially says that for domestic calls, the
   originating local carriers performs the query, otherwise, the long
   distance carrier is expected to.  To ensure independence of the
   actual trigger policy employed in any one carrier, forward call
   signaling is used to flag that an NPDB query has already been
   performed and to therefore suppress any subsequent NP triggers that
   may be encountered in downstream switches, in downstream networks.
   This allows the earliest able network in the call path to perform
   the query without introducing additional costs and call setup delays
   were redundant queries performed downstream.

7.1 U.S. and Canada

   In the U.S. and Canada, a ten-digit North American Numbering Plan
   (NANP) number called Location Routing Number (LRN) is assigned to
   every switch involved in NP.  In the NANP, a switch is not reachable
   unless it has a unique number range (CO code) assigned to it.
   Consequently, the LRN for a switch is always assigned out of a CO
   code that is assigned to that switch.

   The LRN assigned to a switch currently serving a particular ported
   telephone number is returned as the network routing address in the
   NPDB response.  The service portability scheme that was adopted in
   the North America is very often referred to as the LRN scheme or
   method.

   LRN serves as a network address for terminating calls served off
   that switch using ported numbers.  The LRN is assigned by the switch
   operator using any of the unique CO codes (NPA+NXX) assigned to that
   switch.  The LRN is considered a non-dialable address, as the same
   10-digit number value may be assigned to a line on that switch.  A
   switch may have more than one LRN.

   During call routing/processing, a switch performs an NPDB query to
   obtain the LRN associated with the dialed directory number. NPDB
   queries are performed for all the dialed directory numbers whose
   NPA+NXX codes are marked as portable NPA+NXX at that switch. When
   formulating the ISUP Initial Address Message (IAM) to be sent to the

<Foster,McGarry,Yu> Informational - Expiration in January 2001      14

             Number Portability in the GSTN: An Overview      July 2000


   next switch, the switch puts the ten-digit LRN in the ISUP Called
   Party Number (CdPN) parameter and the originally dialed directory
   number in the ISUP Generic Address parameter (GAP).  A new code in
   the GAP was defined to indicate that the address information in the
   GAP is the dialed directory number. A new bit in the ISUP Forward
   Call Indicator (FCI) parameter, the Translated Called Number
   Indicator (TCNI) bit, is set to imply that NPDB query has already
   been performed.  All the switches in the downstream will not perform
   the NPDB query if the TCNI bit is set.

   When the terminating switch receives the IAM and sees the TCNI bit
   in the FCI parameter set and its own LRN in the CdPN parameter, it
   retrieves the originally dialed directory number from the GAP and
   uses the dialed directory number to terminate the call.

   A dialed directory number with a portable NPA+NXX does not imply
   that directory number has been ported.  The NPDBs currently do not
   store records for non-ported directory numbers.  In that case, the
   NPDB will return the same dialed directory number instead of the
   LRN.  The switch will then set the TCNI bit but keep the dialed
   directory number in the CdPN parameter.

   In the real world environment, the Originating Network is not always
   the one that performs the NPDB query.  For example, it is usually
   the long distance carriers that query the NPDBs for long distance
   calls.  In that case, the Originating Network operated by the local
   exchange carrier (LEC) simply routes the call to the long distance
   carrier that is to handle that call.   A wireless network acting as
   the Originating Network can also route the call to the
   interconnected local exchange carrier network if it does not want to
   support the NPDB interface at its mobile switches.


7.2 Europe

   In Europe, a routing number is prefixed to the dialed directory
   number.  The ISUP CdPN parameter in the IAM will contain the routing
   prefix and the dialed directory number.  For example, United Kingdom
   uses routing prefixes with the format of 5XXXXX and Italy uses
   C600XXXXX as the routing prefix.  The networks use the information
   in the ISUP CdPN parameter to route the call to the New/Current
   Serving Network.

   The routing prefix can identify the Current Serving Network or the
   Current Serving Switch of a ported number.  For the former case,
   another query to the "internal" NPDB at the Current Serving Network
   is required to identify the Current Serving Switch before routing
   the call to that switch.  This shields the Current Serving Switch
   information for a ported number from the other networks at the
   expense of an additional NPDB query.  Another routing number, may be
   meaningful within the Current Serving Network, will replace the
   previously prefixed routing number in the ISUP CdPN parameter.  For


<Foster,McGarry,Yu> Informational - Expiration in January 2001      15

             Number Portability in the GSTN: An Overview      July 2000


   the latter case, the call is routed to the Current Serving Switch
   without an additional NPDB query.

   When the terminating switch receives the IAM and sees its own
   routing prefix in the CdPN parameter, it retrieves the originally
   dialed directory number after the routing prefix, and uses the
   dialed directory number to terminate the call.

   In addition to the addition of the routing prefix to the CdPN
   parameter, some other information may be added/modified as is listed
   in the draft ITU-T Recommendation Q.769.1 [ISUP].   Those
   enhancements in the ISUP to support number portability are briefly
   described below.

   Three methods can be used to transport the Directory Number (DN) and
   the Routing Number (RN):

   (a) Two separate parameters with the CdPN parameter containing the
      RN and a new Called Directory Number (CdDN) parameter containing
      the DN.  A new value for the Nature of Address (NOA) indicator in
      the CdPN parameter is defined to indicate that the RN is in the
      CdPN parameter.  The switches use the CdPN parameter to route the
      call as is done today.

   (b) Two separate parameters with the CdPN parameter containing the
      DN and a new Network Routing Number (NRN) parameter containing
      the RN.  This method requires that the switches use the NRN
      parameter to route the call.

   (c) Concatenated parameter with the CdPN parameter containing the RN
      plus the DN.  A new Nature of Address (NOA) indicator in the CdPN
      parameter is defined to indicate that the RN is concatenated with
      the DN in the CdPN parameter.  Some countries may not use new NOA
      value because the routing prefix does not overlap with the dialed
      directory numbers.  But if the routing prefix overlaps with the
      dialed directory numbers, a new NOA value must be assigned.
      Spain uses "XXXXX" as the routing prefix to identify the new
      serving network and uses a new NOA value of 126.

   There is also a network option to add a new ISUP parameter called
   Number Portability Forwarding Information parameter.  This parameter
   has a four-bit Number Portability Status Indicator field that can
   provide an indication whether number portability query is done for
   the called directory number and whether the called directory number
   is ported or not if the number portability query is done.

   Please note that all those enhancements are for national use.  This
   is because number portability is supported within a nation.  Within
   each nation, the telecommunications industry or the regulatory
   bodies can decide which method or methods to use.  Number
   portability related parameters and coding are never passed across
   the national boundaries.

             Number Portability in the GSTN: An Overview      July 2000


   As indicated earlier, an originating wireless network can query the
   NPDB and concatenate the RN with DN in the CdPN parameter and route
   the call directly to the Current Serving Network.

   If NPDBs do not contain information about the wireless directory
   numbers, the call, originated from either a wireline or a wireless
   network, will be routed to the Wireless donor network.  Over there,
   an internal NPDB is queried to retrieve the RN that then is
   concatenated with the DN in the CdPN parameter.

   If MNP-SRF is supported, the Gateway Mobile Services Switching
   Center (GMSC) at the wireless donor network, when receiving a call
   from the wireline network, can send the GSM MAP Send Routing
   Information (SRI) message to the MNP-SRF.  The MNP-SRF interrogates
   an internal or integrated NPDB for the RN of the MNP-SRF of the
   wireless Current Serving Network and prefixes the RN to the dialed
   wireless directory number in the global title address information in
   the SCCP Called Party Address (CdPA) parameter.  This SRI message
   will be routed to the MNP-SRF of the wireless Current Serving
   Network, which then responds with an acknowledgement by providing
   the RN plus the dialed wireless directory number as the Mobile
   Station Roaming Number (MSRN).  The GMSC of the wireless donor
   network formulates the ISUP IAM with the RN plus the dialed wireless
   directory number in the CdPN parameter and routes the call to the
   wireless Current Serving Network.  A GMSC of the wireless Current
   Serving Network receives the call and sends an SRI message to the
   associated MNP-SRF where the global title address information of the
   SCCP CdPA parameter contains only the dialed wireless directory
   number.  The MNP-SRF then replaces the global title address
   information in the SCCP CdPA parameter with the address information
   associated with a Home Location Register (HLR) that hosts the dialed
   wireless directory number and forwards the message to that HLR after
   verifying that the dialed wireless directory number is a ported-in
   number.   The HLR then returns an acknowledgement by providing an
   MSRN for the GMSC to route the call to the MSC that currently serves
   the mobile station that is associated with the dialed wireless
   directory number.  Please see [MNP] for details and additional
   scenarios.

9. Number Conservation Methods Enabled by NP

   In addition to porting numbers NP provides the ability for number
   administrators to assign numbering resources to operators in smaller
   increments.  Today it is common for numbering resources to be
   assigned to telephone operators in a large block of consecutive
   telephone numbers (TNs).  For example, in North America each of
   these blocks contains 10,000 TNs and is of the format NXX+0000 to
   NXX+9999.  Operators are assigned a specific NXX, or block.  That
   operator is referred to as the block holder.  In that block there
   are 10,000 TNs with line numbers ranging from 0000 to 9999.

   Instead of assigning an entire block to the operator NP allows the
   administrator to assign a sub-block or even an individual telephone
   number.  This is referred to as block pooling and individual
   telephone number (ITN) pooling, respectively.

9.1 Block Pooling

   Block Pooling refers to the process whereby the number administrator
   assigns a range of numbers defined by a logical sub-block of the
   existing block.  Using North America as an example, block pooling
   would allow the administrator to assign sub-blocks of 1,000 TNs to
   multiple operators.  That is, NXX+0000 to NXX+0999 can be assigned
   to operator A, NXX+1000 to NXX+1999 can be assigned to operator B,
   NXX-2000 to 2999 can be assigned to operator C, etc.  In this
   example block pooling divides one block of 10,000 TNs into ten
   blocks of 1,000 TNs.

   Porting the sub-blocks from the block holder enables block pooling.
   Using the example above operator A is the block holder, as well as,
   the holder of the first sub-block, NXX+0000 to NXX+0999.  The second
   sub-block, NXX+1000 to NXX+1999, is ported from operator A to
   operator B.  The third sub-block, NXX+2000 to NXX+2999, is ported
   from operator A to operator C, and so on.  NP administrative
   processes and call processing will enable proper and efficient
   routing.

   From a number administration and NP administration perspective block
   pooling introduces a new concept, that of the sub-block holder.
   Block pooling requires coordination between the number
   administrator, the NP administrator, the block holder, and the sub-
   block holder.  Block pooling must be implemented in a manner that
   allows for NP within the sub-blocks.  Each TN can have a different
   serving operator, sub-block holder, and block holder.

9.2 ITN Pooling

   ITN pooling refers to the process whereby the number administrator
   assigns individual telephone numbers to operators.  Using the North

             Number Portability in the GSTN: An Overview      July 2000


   American example, one block of 10,000 TNs can be divided into 10,000
   ITNs.  ITN is more commonly deployed in freephone services.

   In ITN the block is not assigned to an operator but to a central
   administrator.  The administrator then assigns ITNs to operators.
   NP administrative processes and call processing will enable proper
   and efficient routing.

10. Conclusion

   There are three general areas of impact to IP telephony work-in-
   progress at IETF:

   1. NP implementation or emulation in IP telephony
   2. Interoperation between NP in GSTN and IP telephony
   3. Interconnection to NP administrative environment

   A good understanding of how number portability is supported in the
   GSTN is important when addressing the interworking issues between IP
   based networks and the GSTN.  This is especially important when the
   IP based network needs to route the calls to the GSTN.  As shown in
   Section 6, there are a variety of standards with various protocol
   stacks for the switch-to-NPDB interface.  Not only that, the
   national variations of the protocol standards and make it very
   complicate to deal with in a global environment.  If an entity in
   the IP-based network needs to query those existing NPDBs for routing
   number information to terminate the calls to the destination GSTN,
   it would be impractical, if not an impossible, job for that entity
   to support all those interface standards to access the NPDBs in many
   countries.

   Several alternatives may address this particular problem.  One
   alternative is to use certain entities in the IP-based networks for
   dealing with NP query, similar to the International Switches that
   are used in the GSTN to interwork different national ISUP
   variations.  This will force signaling information associated with
   the calls to certain NP-capable networks in the terminating GSTN to
   be routed to those IP entities that support the NP functions.  Those
   IP entities then query the NPDBs in the terminating country.   This
   will limit the number of NPDB interfaces that certain IP entities
   need to support.  Another alternative can be to define a "common"
   interface to be supported by all the NPDBs so that all the IP
   entities use that standardized protocol to query them.   The
   existing NPDBs can support this additional interface, or new NPDBs
   can be deployed that contain the same information but support the
   common IP interface. The candidates for such a common interface
   include Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and SIP
   [SIP](e.g., using the SIP redirection capability).

   IP-based networks can handle the domestic calls between two GSTNs.
   If the originating GSTN has performed NPDB query, SIP will need to
   transport and make use of some of the ISUP signaling information
   even if ISUP signaling may be encapsulated in SIP.  Also, IP-based

<Foster,McGarry,Yu> Informational - Expiration in January 2001      21

             Number Portability in the GSTN: An Overview      July 2000


   networks may perform the NPDB queries, as the N-1 carrier.  In that
   case, SIP also needs to transport the NP related information while
   the call is being routed to the destination GSTN.  There are three
   pieces of NP related information that SIP needs to transport.  They
   are 1) the called directory number, 2) a routing number, and 3) a
   NPDB dip indicator.  The NPDB dip indicator is needed so that the
   terminating GSTN will not perform another NPDB dip.  The routing
   number is needed so that it is used to route the call to the
   destination network or switch in the destination GSTN.  The called
   directory number is needed so that the terminating GSTN switch can
   terminate the call.  When the routing number is present, the NPDB
   dip indicator may not be present because there are cases where
   routing number is added for routing the call even if NP is not
   involved.  One issue is how to transport the NP related information
   via SIP.  The SIP Universal Resource Locator (URL) is one mechanism.
   Another better choice may be to add an extension to the "tel" URL
   [TEL] that is also supported by SIP.  If the called directory is +1-
   202-533-1234, and its associated routing number is +1-202-544-0000,
   the "tel" URL may look like tel:+1-202-533-1234;rn=+1-202-544-
   0000;npdi=yes where "rn" stands for "routing number" and "npdi"
   stands for "NPDB dip indicator."  "rn" and "npdi" will be two new
   parameters to be added as extensions to the "tel" URL to support NP.
   Since the "fax" URL is similar to the "tel" URL where NP can impact
   the fax calls as well as the telephone calls, the same extensions to
   the "tel" URL need to be applied to the "fax" URL as well.

   For a called directory number that belongs to a country that
   supports NP, and if the IP-based network is to perform the NPDB
   query, the logical step is to perform the NPDB dip first to retrieve
   the routing number and use that routing number to select the correct
   IP telephony gateways that can reach the serving switch that serves
   the called directory number.  Therefor, if the "rn" parameter is
   present in the "tel" URL in the SIP INVITE message, it instead of
   the called directory number should be used for making routing
   decisions.  If "rn" is not present, then the dialed directory number
   can be used as the routing number for making routing decisions
   [TEL].

   Telephony Routing Information Protocol (TRIP) [TRIP] is a policy
   driven inter-administrative domain protocol for advertising the
   reachability of telephony destinations between location servers, and
   for advertising attributes of the routes to those destinations.
   With the NP in mind, it is very important to know that it is the
   routing number,if present, not the called directory number that
   should be used to check against the TRIP tables for making the
   routing decisions.

   Overlap signaling exists in the GSTN today.  For a call routing from
   the originating GSTN to the IP-based network that involves overlap
   signaling, NP will impact the call processing within the IP-based
   networks if they must deal with the overlap signaling.  The entities
   in the IP-based networks that are to retrieve the NP information
   (e.g., the routing number) must collect a complete called directory

<Foster,McGarry,Yu> Informational - Expiration in January 2001      22

             Number Portability in the GSTN: An Overview      July 2000


   number information before retrieving the NP information for a ported
   number.  Otherwise, the information retrieval won't be successful.
   This is an issue for the IP-based networks if the originating GSTN
   does not handle the overlap signaling and collect the complete
   called directory number.

   The IETF enum working group is defining the use of Domain Name
   System (DNS) for identifying available services associated with a
   particular E.164 number [ENUM].  [ENUMPO] outlines the principles
   for the operation of a telephone number service that resolves
   telephone numbers into Internet domain name addresses and service-
   specific directory discovery.  [ENUMPO] implements a three-level
   approach where the first level is the mapping of the telephone
   number delegation tree to the authority to which the number has been
   delegated, the second level is the provision of the requested DNS
   resource records from a service registrar, and the third level is
   the provision of service specific data from the service provider
   itself.  NP certainly must be considered at the first level because
   the telephony service providers do not "own" or control the
   telephone numbers under the NP environment; therefore, they may not
   be the proper entities to have the authority for a given E.164
   number.  Not only that, the donor network should not be relied on to
   reach the delegated authority during the DNS process because there
   is a regulatory requirement on NP in some countries.  The delegated
   authority for a given E.164 number is likely to be an entity
   designated by the end user that owns/controls a specific telephone
   number or a third-party designated by the end-user or by the
   industry.

   The IP-based networks also may need to support some forms of number
   portability in the future if E.164 numbers [E164] are assigned to
   the IP-based end users.  One method is to assign a GSTN routing
   number for each IP-based network domain or entity in a NP-capable
   country.  This may increase the number of digits in the routing
   number to incorporate the IP entities and impact the existing
   routing in the GSTN.  Another method is to associate each IP entity
   with a particular GSTN gateway.  At that particular GSTN gateway,
   the called directory number then is used to locate the IP-entity
   that serves that dialed directory number.  Yet, another method can
   be to assign a special routing number so that the call to an end
   user currently served by an IP entity is routed to the nearest GSTN
   gateway.  The called directory number then is used to locate the IP-
   entity that serves that dialed directory number.  Then a mechanism
   is developed for the IP-based network to locate the IP entity that
   serves a particular dialed directory number.  Many other types of
   networks use E.164 numbers to identify the end users or terminals in
   those networks.  Number portability among GSTN, IP-based network and
   those various types of networks may also need to be supported in the
   future.

APPENDICES

APPENDIX A. NP Requirements in the North America

A.1 Background

   The North American telecommunications industry began to seriously
   investigate methods of providing local number portability (LNP) in
   late 1994.  On July 13, 1995, the Federal Communications Commission
   (FCC) in the U.S. issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) FCC
   Docket Number 95-116 that opened discussion on NP and sought
   comments on a wide variety of policy and technical issues related to
   NP.

   In 1995 and 1996 several state regulatory bodies, notably the
   Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC), began the process of officially
   selecting the architecture to be used for NP in their respective
   states.  After considerable discussion and deliberation, the
   "Location Routing Number (LRN)" scheme was selected by Illinois, and
   other states.  The switching and signaling requirements for number
   portability developed in the Illinois LNP workshop under the
   auspices of the ICC became the basis of the de facto North American
   industry standards [ICC].  The activities on number portability in
   the North America also interacted with activities in many other
   parts of world.

A.2 Performance/Legal/Regulatory Requirements

   After substantial industry discussion and debate, and extensive
   comments filed with the FCC, the FCC and the US telecommunications
   industry set the following minimum performance criteria for LNP:

   1. Support existing network services, features and capabilities.
   2. Efficiently use numbering resources.
   3. Not require end users to change their telecommunication numbers.
   4. Not require telecommunications carrier to rely on databases,
     other network facilities, or services provided by other
     telecommunications carriers in order to route calls to proper
     termination point.
   5. Not result in unreasonable degradation in service quality or
     network reliability when implemented.
   6. Not result in unreasonable degradation of service quality or
     network reliability when customers switch carriers.
   7. Not result in a carrier having a proprietary interest.
   8. Be able to accommodate location and service portability in the
     future.
   9. Have no significant adverse impact outside areas where number
     portability is deployed.

   In July 1996, the FCC issued the First Report and Order on LNP under
   95-116, calling for the deployment of LNP across the US starting in
   1997.  The FCC did not mandate any specific implementation of LNP in

   national standard that would ensure interoperability with all
   industry segments, including wireless.  While providing overall
   guidelines and requirements for LNP, it did explicitly state that
   the LRN method met these requirements, whereas alternate proposals
   (such as QoR) did not.

   A core requirement was that a carrier who is serving ported numbers
   need not be reliant on any other carrier (especially the donor
   network) for completing calls, whether for call transport/routing or
   for signaling.  That's not to say that a carrier couldn't
   voluntarily opt to use another carrier or the donor network for
   queries or call routing.  But the key is voluntarily.  This
   requirement was imposed on all NP implementations in the U.S. for
   common carrier telephony services regardless of the network
   technology employed.

   Similar requirements were adopted by the Canadian Radio and
   Television Commission (CRTC), the equivalent of the FCC in Canada,
   and in a number of regulatory and industry bodies in other countries
   (e.g., Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Switzerland) which resulted in the
   use of centralized NPDBs to support number portability.

   In the U.S. and Canada, the ACQ scheme was adopted because it does
   not rely on the donor network for call routing (see requirements
   numbers 4 and 7) and it can accommodate location and service
   portability in the future.

   In the U.S. and Canada, there is also the "N-1" guideline that
   recommends that the network next to the destination network perform
   the NPDB query if the NPDB query has not been done or the routing
   information is not available (e.g., due to signaling interworking).
   This is to prevent the call from being re-routed at the donor
   network.  In the U.S., the wireline carriers are required to support
   NP in certain service areas in phases.  The wireless carriers'
   support of NP has been postponed until November 2002.

APPENDIX B. NP Administration Process in the North America

   B.1 Business Model

   Figure B.1 shows the NP business model that was adopted in the U.S.
   and Canada.  The U.S. is divided into seven regions coinciding with
   the boundaries of the original seven Regional Bell Operating Company
   (RBOC) regions.  This was done to facilitate the formation of
   separate contracting and administrative areas (formed as limited
   liability companies) for LNP in the US intentionally coinciding with
   the original RBOC boundaries, thus enabling each RBOC to participate
   singly in each of these areas.

   NeuStar, Inc., formerly the Communication Industry Services business
   unit with Lockheed Martin IMS, was selected in open competitive
   procurements conducted by the industry to be the Number Portability
   Administration Center (NPAC) provider for all the seven NPAC regions
   (Midwest, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southwest, Southeast, Western,
   and West Coast) in the U.S. Lockheed Martin was subsequently named
   as the NPAC provider in Canada as well.  Each Limited Liability
   Corp. (LLC) in the seven U.S. regions and Canadian Consortium
   maintain largely identical contracts with NeuStar covering each
   region.

   The FCC and North American Numbering Council (NANC) oversee the
   technical and operational standards, originally developed by
   Lockheed Martin and offered as open industry standards, and cost
   recovery rulemakings.
   Each LLC signed a master contract with NeuStar that set the prices
   and terms and provided the form of User Agreement for NeuStar to
   sign with each individual NPAC user.  NPAC users are any bona fide
   entity that either ports numbers or subscribes to updates to the
   NPDB provided by the NPAC.

   The User Agreements come under the Master Agreements and must be
   signed by the individual Customers who wish to use NPAC services.
   If a Customer plans on operating in more than one region, the
   Customer must sign a separate User Agreement for each of the regions
   where operations will take place.

   The Interconnect Plan is another NeuStar confidential document that
   the Customer must sign and return.  This document provides an
   overview of the customer interconnection to the NPAC.

   The new customer process is shown below.

   - Customer contacts Chicago NPAC (Help Desk) to request information.
   - Introduction Package (Application, Non-Disclosure Agreement) sent
     to customer.
   - Customer signs and returns Non-disclosure Agreement.
   - Master Agreement, User Agreement and Interconnect Plan sent to
     Customer.
   - Customer signs and returns User Agreement.
   - Customer signs and returns Interconnect Plan.
   - Customer data entered.

   The interface between the Service Order Administration (SOA) and the
   NPAC/SMS is for provisioning ported end-user data including the
   support of the creation, cancellation, retrieval and update of
   subscription, service provider, and network information.  The SOAs
   are operated by the local exchange carriers.

   The interface between the Local Service Management System (LSMS) and
   the NPAC/SMS is mainly used for downloading ported number
   information from the NPAC/SMS to the LSMS.  The LSMS then updates
   the NPDB.  A local exchange carrier may operate the LSMS if it
   decides to deploy an NPDB itself.  A service bureau can also operate
   the LSMS to provision several LECs' NPDBs or operate the LSMS and
   the NPDB for the operators (e.g., LECs or long distance carriers) to
   query.  The interface between the LSMS and the NPDB is up to the
   entities that operate them.

   The functional requirement specification developed under the
   auspices of the North American Numbering Council (NANC) defines the
   external functionality of the NPAC SMS [FRS].  The interfaces
   between the NPAC/SMS and the SOA or LSMS use standards-based
   communications and security technologies and are made public [IIS].
   Please note that only the information about the ported numbers is
   stored at the NPAC databases and the NPDBs at present.

B.3 NPAC SMS Functions

   This section provides a list of the NPAC SMS functions.  Please see
   [FRS] for details.

  - Provisioning Service: For the new service provider to notify the
     NPAC SMS of a provision request for a ported number and to send an
     activation notice to activate the update from the NPAC SMS to the
     LSMS.

             Number Portability in the GSTN: An Overview      July 2000



  - Disconnect Service: For handling disconnection of the telephony
     service for a ported number.

  - Repair Service: For resolving problems detected either by a Service
     Provider or by a customer contacting a Service Provider.

  - Conflict Resolution: For resolving a conflict when there is
     disagreement between the old and new Service Providers as to who
     will be providing service for the telephone number (TN).  Please
     note that the processes for obtaining authorization from the
     customer to port a number are defined by the Service Providers.
     The NPAC is not involved in obtaining or verifying customer
     approval to port a telephone number.

  - Disaster Recovery and Backup: For having a backup facility and the
     disaster recovery procedures in place for planned and unplanned
     downtime at the primary facility.

  - Order Cancellation: For the new Service Provider to cancel a
     previously submitted but not activated provision request.

   - Audit Request: For troubleshooting customer problems and also as a
     maintenance process to ensure data integrity across the entire NP
     network.

   - Report Request: For supporting report generation for pre-defined
     and ad-hoc reports.

   - Data Management: For managing network, Service Provider, and
     customer subscription data.  The network data defines the
     configuration of the NP service and network and includes such data
     as: participating Service Providers, NPA-NXXs that are portable,
     and LRNs associated with each Service Provider.  The Service
     Provider data indicates who the NP Service Providers are and
     includes location, contact name, security, routing, and network
     interface information.  The subscription data indicates how local
     number portability should operate to meet subscribers' needs.

   - NPA-NXX Split Processing: For the administration of the
     information for NPA split (the current NPA, the new NPA, and the
     affected NXXs) plus the beginning and end date of the permissive
     dialing period.

   - Business Support: For supporting service providers that have
     different needs for business hours and days available for porting.

   - Notification Recovery: For allowing a Service Provider to capture,
     via a recovery process, all notifications that were missed during
     a downtime period for the Service Provider.


B.4 Cost Recovery

   In the FCC's Third Report and Order, adopted May 5, 1998, released
   May 12, 1998 and published in the Federal Registry July 29, 1998 the
   Commission implemented section 251(e)(2) with regards to the costs
   of providing long-term number portability.  Section 251(e)(2) of the
   Communications Act of 1934 (1934 Act), as amended requires that "the
   cost of establishing telecommunications numbering administration
   arrangements and number portability shall be borne by all
   telecommunications carriers on a competitively neutral basis as
   determined by the Commission."

   The costs can be categorized below.

   - Share costs incurred by industry as a whole for the NPACs:
    * Non-recurring costs, e.g., administrator costs to implement
      database hardware and software.
    * Recurring costs, e.g., administrator costs to administer the
      databases.
    * Costs incurred by administrators to upload and download data to
      and from databases.  Shared costs of each regional database
      distributed among telecommunications carriers with revenue
      derived from providing telecommunications service in the area
      served by the database, in proportion to carrier's share of
      revenue for the region.  Carriers without such revenue assessed
      $100 per year.

   - Carrier-specific costs incurred by each carrier that directly
     relates to providing NP, e.g., querying calls, porting telephone
     numbers between carriers.
    * Dedicated costs, e.g., number portability software, NPDBs and
      STPs reserved exclusively for NP.
    * Joint costs, e.g., software generics, switch hardware, Operation
      Support System (OSS), SS7 or AIN upgrade, incremental to
      providing NP.  Carriers may include incremental overhead incurred
      specifically in providing NP.

   Incumbent LECs may recover costs directly related to providing NP
   through federally tariffed charges that can be query-service
   charges, prearranged and default, and monthly end-user charges. For
   example, the end-users in the metropolitan D.C. area pay 23 cents
   per month for NP surcharge. Carriers, other than incumbent LECs, may
   recover costs in any manner consistent with state and federal laws
   and regulations.
