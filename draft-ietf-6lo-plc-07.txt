             Transmission of IPv6 Packets over PLC Networks
                         draft-ietf-6lo-plc-07

Abstract

   Power Line Communication (PLC), namely using the electric-power lines
   for indoor and outdoor communications, has been widely applied to
   support Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), especially smart
   meters for electricity.  The existing electricity infrastructure
   facilitates the expansion of PLC deployments due to its potential
   advantages in terms of cost and convenience.  Moreover, a wide
   variety of accessible devices raises the potential demand of IPv6 for
   future applications.  This document describes how IPv6 packets are
   transported over constrained PLC networks, such as ITU-T G.9903, IEEE
   1901.1 and IEEE 1901.2.

Internet-Draft                IPv6 over PLC                December 2021


1.  Introduction

   The idea of using power lines for both electricity supply and
   communication can be traced back to the beginning of the last
   century.  Using the existing power grid to transmit messages, Power
   Line Communication (PLC) is a good candidate for supporting various
   service scenarios such as in houses and offices, in trains and
   vehicles, in smart grid and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI)
   [SCENA].  The data acquisition devices in these scenarios share
   common features such as fixed position, large quantity, low data rate
   and low power consumption.

   Although PLC technology has evolved over several decades, it has not
   been fully adapted for IPv6-based constrained networks.  The
   resource-constrained IoT-related scenarios lie in the low voltage PLC
   networks with most applications in the area of Advanced Metering
   Infrastructure (AMI), Vehicle-to-Grid communications, in-home energy
   management, and smart street lighting.  IPv6 is important for PLC
   networks, due to its large address space and efficient address auto-
   configuration.

   This document provides a brief overview of PLC technologies.  Some of
   them have LLN (low power and lossy network) characteristics, i.e.,
   limited power consumption, memory and processing resources.  This
   document specifies the transmission of IPv6 packets over those
   "constrained" PLC networks.  The general approach is to adapt
   elements of the 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area
   Network) and 6lo (IPv6 over Networks of Resource-constrained Nodes)
   specifications, such as [RFC4944], [RFC6282], [RFC6775] and [RFC8505]
   to constrained PLC networks.

3.  Overview of PLC

   PLC technology enables convenient two-way communications for home
   users and utility companies to monitor and control electric plugged
   devices such as electricity meters and street lights.  PLC can also
   be used in smart home scenarios, such as the control of indoor lights
   and switches.  Due to the large range of communication frequencies,
   PLC is generally classified into two categories: Narrowband PLC
   (NBPLC) for automation of sensors (which have a low frequency band
   and low power cost), and Broadband PLC (BBPLC) for home and industry
   networking applications.

   Various standards have been addressed on the MAC and PHY layers for
   this communication technology, e.g., BBPLC (1.8-250 MHz) including
   IEEE 1901 and ITU-T G.hn, and NBPLC (3-500 kHz) including ITU-T
   G.9902 (G.hnem), ITU-T G.9903 (G3-PLC) [ITU-T_G.9903], ITU-T G.9904
   (PRIME), IEEE 1901.2 [IEEE_1901.2] (a combination of G3-PLC and PRIME
   PLC) and IEEE 1901.2a [IEEE_1901.2a] (an amendment to IEEE 1901.2).

   A new PLC standard IEEE 1901.1 [IEEE_1901.1], which is aimed at the
   medium frequency band of less than 12 MHz, has been published by the
   IEEE standard for Smart Grid Powerline Communication Working Group
   (SGPLC WG).  IEEE 1901.1 balances the needs for bandwidth versus
   communication range, and is thus a promising option for 6lo
   applications.

   This specification is focused on IEEE 1901.1, IEEE 1901.2, and ITU-T
   G.9903.

3.1.  Protocol Stack

   The protocol stack for IPv6 over PLC is illustrated in Figure 1.  The
   PLC MAC/PHY layer corresponds to IEEE 1901.1, IEEE 1901.2 or ITU-T
   G.9903.  The 6lo adaptation layer for PLC is illustrated in
   Section 4.  For multihop tree and mesh topologies, a routing protocol
   is likely to be necessary.  The routes can be built in mesh-under
   mode at layer 2 or in route-over mode at layer-3, as explained in
   Section 3.4.

3.2.  Addressing Modes

   Each PLC device has a globally unique long address of 48-bits
   ([IEEE_1901.1]) or 64-bits ([IEEE_1901.2], [ITU-T_G.9903]) and a
   short address of 12-bits ([IEEE_1901.1]) or 16-bits ([IEEE_1901.2],
   [ITU-T_G.9903]).  The long address is set by the manufacturer
   according to the IEEE EUI-48 MAC address or the IEEE EUI-64 address.
   Each PLC device joins the network by using the long address and
   communicates with other devices by using the short address after
   joining the network.  Short addresses can be assigned during the
   onboarding process, by the PANC or the JRC (join registrar/
   coordinator) in CoJP (Constrained Join Protocol)
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security].

3.3.  Maximum Transmission Unit

   The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the MAC layer determines
   whether fragmentation and reassembly are needed at the adaptation
   layer of IPv6 over PLC.  IPv6 requires an MTU of 1280 octets or
   greater; thus for a MAC layer with MTU lower than this limit,
   fragmentation and reassembly at the adaptation layer are required.

   The IEEE 1901.1 MAC supports upper layer packets up to 2031 octets.
   The IEEE 1901.2 MAC layer supports an MTU of 1576 octets (the
   original value of 1280 bytes was updated in 2015 [IEEE_1901.2a]).
   Though these two technologies can support IPv6 originally without
   fragmentation and reassembly, it is possible to configure a smaller
   MTU in high-noise communication environment.  Thus the 6lo functions,
   including header compression, fragmentation and reassembly, are still
   applicable and useful.

Internet-Draft                IPv6 over PLC                December 2021


   The MTU for ITU-T G.9903 is 400 octets, insufficient for supporting
   IPv6's MTU.  For this reason, fragmentation and reassembly is
   required for G.9903-based networks to carry IPv6.

3.4.  Routing Protocol

   Routing protocols suitable for use in PLC networks include:

   o  RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) [RFC6550]
      is a layer-3 routing protocol.  AODV-RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-aodv-rpl]
      updates RPL to include reactive, point-to-point, and asymmetric
      routing.  IEEE 1901.2 specifies Information Elements (IEs) with
      MAC layer metrics, which can be provided to L3 routing protocol
      for parent selection.

   o  IEEE 1901.1 supports the mesh-under routing scheme.  Each PLC node
      maintains a routing table, in which each route entry comprises the
      short addresses of the destination and the related next hop.  The
      route entries are built during the network establishment via a
      pair of association request/confirmation messages.  The route
      entries can be changed via a pair of proxy change request/
      confirmation messages.  These association and proxy change
      messages must be approved by the central coordinator (PANC in this
      document).

   o  LOADng (The Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc Distance vector routing
      protocol, Next Generation) is a reactive protocol operating at
      layer-2 or layer-3.  Currently, LOADng is supported in ITU-T
      G.9903 [ITU-T_G.9903], and the IEEE 1901.2 standard refers to
      ITU-T G.9903 for LOAD-based networks.

4.  IPv6 over PLC

   6LoWPAN and 6lo standards [RFC4944], [RFC6282], [RFC6775], and
   [RFC8505] provide useful functionality including link-local IPv6
   addresses, stateless address auto-configuration, neighbor discovery,
   header compression, fragmentation, and reassembly.  However, due to
   the different characteristics of the PLC media, the 6LoWPAN
   adaptation layer, as it is, cannot perfectly fulfill the requirements
   of PLC environments.  These considerations suggest the need for a
   dedicated adaptation layer for PLC, which is detailed in the
   following subsections.

4.1.  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration

   To obtain an IPv6 Interface Identifier (IID), a PLC device performs
   stateless address autoconfiguration [RFC4944].  The autoconfiguration
   can be based on either a long or short link-layer address.



Hou, et al.               Expires July 2, 2022                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                IPv6 over PLC                December 2021


   The IID can be based on the device's 48-bit MAC address or its EUI-64
   identifier [EUI-64].  A 48-bit MAC address MUST first be extended to
   a 64-bit Interface ID by inserting 0xFFFE at the fourth and fifth
   octets as specified in [RFC2464].  The IPv6 IID is derived from the
   64-bit Interface ID by inverting the U/L bit [RFC4291].

   For IEEE 1901.2 and ITU-T G.9903, a 48-bit "pseudo-address" is formed
   by the 16-bit PAN ID, 16 zero bits and the 16-bit short address as
   follows:

       16_bit_PAN:0000:16_bit_short_address

   Then, the 64-bit Interface ID MUST be derived by inserting 16-bit
   0xFFFE into as follows:

       16_bit_PAN:00FF:FE00:16_bit_short_address

   For the 12-bit short addresses used by IEEE 1901.1, the 48-bit
   pseudo-address is formed by 24-bit NID (Network IDentifier, YYYYYY),
   12 zero bits and a 12-bit TEI (Terminal Equipment Identifier, XXX) as
   follows:

       YYYY:YY00:0XXX

   The 64-bit Interface ID MUST be derived by inserting 16-bit 0xFFFE
   into this 48-bit pseudo-address as follows:

       YYYY:YYFF:FE00:0XXX

   As investigated in [RFC7136], besides [RFC4291], some other IID
   generation methods defined in IETF do not imply any semantics for the
   "Universal/Local" (U/L) bit (bit 6) and the Individual/Group bit (bit
   7), so that these two bits are not reliable indicators for their
   original meanings.  Thus when using an IID derived by a short
   address, the operators of the PLC network can choose to comply with
   original meaning of these two bits or not.  If so, since the IID
   derived from the short address is not global, these two bits MUST
   both be set to zero.  In order to avoid any ambiguity in the derived
   Interface ID, these two bits MUST NOT be used to generate the PANID
   (for IEEE 1901.2 and ITU-T G.9903) or NID (for IEEE 1901.1).  In
   other words, the PANID or NID MUST always be chosen so that these
   bits are zeros.  If not, the operator must be aware that these two
   bits are not reliable indicators, and the IID cannot be transformed
   back into a short link layer address via a reverse operation of the
   mechanism presented above.

   For privacy reasons, the IID derived from the MAC address (with
   padding and bits flipping) SHOULD only be used for link-local address

   configuration.  A PLC host SHOULD use the IID derived from the link-
   layer short address to configure IPv6 addresses used for
   communication with the public network; otherwise, the host's MAC
   address is exposed.  As per [RFC8065], when short addresses are used
   on PLC links, a shared secret key or version number from the
   Authoritative Border Router Option [RFC6775] can be used to improve
   the entropy of the hash input, thus the generated IID can be spread
   out to the full range of the IID address space while stateless
   address compression is still allowed.  The hash algorithm by default
   of the implementations SHOULD be SHA256, using the version number,
   the PANID/NID and the short address as the input arguments, and the
   256-bits hash output is truncated into the IID by taking the high 64
   bits.

4.2.  IPv6 Link Local Address

   The IPv6 link-local address [RFC4291] for a PLC interface is formed
   by appending the IID, as defined above, to the prefix FE80::/64 (see
   Figure 2).

4.3.  Unicast Address Mapping

   The address resolution procedure for mapping IPv6 unicast addresses
   into PLC link-layer addresses follows the general description in
   section 7.2 of [RFC4861].  [RFC6775] improves this procedure by
   eliminating usage of multicast NS.  The resolution is realized by the
   NCEs (neighbor cache entry) created during the address registration
   at the routers.  [RFC8505] further improves the registration
   procedure by enabling multiple LLNs to form an IPv6 subnet, and by
   inserting a link-local address registration to better serve proxy
   registration of new devices.

4.4.  Neighbor Discovery

   Neighbor discovery procedures for 6LoWPAN networks are described in
   Neighbor Discovery Optimization for 6LoWPANs [RFC6775] and [RFC8505].
   These optimizations support the registration of sleeping hosts.
   Although PLC devices are electrically powered, sleeping mode SHOULD
   still be used for power saving.

   For IPv6 prefix dissemination, Router Solicitations (RS) and Router
   Advertisements (RA) MAY be used as per [RFC6775].  If the PLC network
   uses route-over, the IPv6 prefix MAY be disseminated by the layer-3
   routing protocol, such as RPL, which may include the prefix in the
   DIO (DODAG Information Object) message.  As per [RFC9010], it is
   possible to have PLC devices configured as RPL-unaware-leaves, which
   do not participate in RPL at all, along with RPL-aware PLC devices.
   In this case, the prefix dissemination SHOULD use the RS/RA messages.

   For context information dissemination, Router Advertisements (RA)
   MUST be used as per [RFC6775].  The 6LoWPAN context option (6CO) MUST
   be included in the RA to disseminate the Context IDs used for prefix
   and/or address compression.

   For address registration in route-over mode, a PLC device MUST
   register its addresses by sending a unicast link-local Neighbor
   Solicitation to the 6LR.  If the registered address is link-local,
   the 6LR SHOULD NOT further register it to the registrar (6LBR, 6BBR).
   Otherwise, the address MUST be registered via an ARO or EARO included
   in the DAR ([RFC6775]) or EDAR ([RFC8505]) messages.  For RFC8505
   compliant PLC devices, the 'R' flag in the EARO MUST be set when
   sending Neighbor Solicitations in order to extract the status
   information in the replied Neighbor Advertisements from the 6LR.  If
   DHCPv6 is used to assign addresses or the IPv6 address is derived
   from unique long or short link layer address, Duplicate Address
   Detection (DAD) SHOULD NOT be utilized.  Otherwise, the DAD MUST be
   performed at the 6LBR (as per [RFC6775]) or proxied by the routing
   registrar (as per [RFC8505]).  The registration status is fed back
   via the DAC or EDAC message from the 6LBR and the Neighbor

   Advertisement (NA) from the 6LR.  The section 6 of [RFC8505] how
   RFC6775-only devices work with RFC8505-updated devices.

   For address registration in mesh-under mode, since all the PLC
   devices are link-local neighbors to the 6LBR, DAR/DAC or EDAR/EDAC
   messages are not required.  A PLC device MUST register its addresses
   by sending a unicast NS message with an ARO or EARO.  The
   registration status is fed back via the NA message from the 6LBR.

4.5.  Header Compression

   The compression of IPv6 datagrams within PLC MAC frames refers to
   [RFC6282], which updates [RFC4944].  Header compression as defined in
   [RFC6282] which specifies the compression format for IPv6 datagrams
   on top of IEEE 802.15.4, is the basis for IPv6 header compression in
   PLC.  For situations when PLC MAC MTU cannot support the 1280-octet
   IPv6 packet, headers MUST be compressed according to [RFC6282]
   encoding formats, including the Dispatch Header, the LOWPAN_IPHC and
   the compression residu carried in-line.

   For IEEE 1901.2 and G.9903, the IP header compression follows the
   instruction in [RFC6282].  However, additional adaptation MUST be
   considered for IEEE 1901.1 since it has a short address of 12 bits
   instead of 16 bits.  The only modification is the semantics of the
   "Source Address Mode" and the "Dstination Address Mode" when set as
   "10" in the section 3.1 of [RFC6282], which is illustrated as
   following.

   SAM: Source Address Mode:

   If SAC=0: Stateless compression

   10:   16 bits.  The first 112 bits of the address are elided.  The
         value of the first 64 bits is the link-local prefix padded with
         zeros.  The following 64 bits are 0000:00ff:fe00:0XXX, where
         0XXX are the 16 bits carried in-line.

   If SAC=1: stateful context-based compression

   10:   16 bits.  The address is derived using context information and
         the 16 bits carried in-line.  Bits covered by context
         information are always used.  Any IID bits not covered by
         context information are taken directly from their corresponding
         bits in the 16-bit to IID mapping given by 0000:00ff:fe00:0XXX,
         where 0XXX are the 16 bits carried inline.  Any remaining bits
         are zero.

   DAM: Destination Address Mode:

   If M=0 and DAC=0: Stateless compression

   10:   16 bits.  The first 112 bits of the address are elided.  The
         value of the first 64 bits is the link-local prefix padded with
         zeros.  The following 64 bits are 0000:00ff: fe00:0XXX, where
         0XXX are the 16 bits carried in-line.

   If M=0 and DAC=1: stateful context-based compression

   10:   16 bits.  The address is derived using context information and
         the 16 bits carried in-line.  Bits covered by context
         information are always used.  Any IID bits not covered by
         context information are taken directly from their corresponding
         bits in the 16-bit to IID mapping given by 0000:00ff:fe00:0XXX,
         where XXXX are the 16 bits carried in- line.  Any remaining
         bits are zero.

4.6.  Fragmentation and Reassembly

   The constrained PLC MAC layer provides the function of fragmentation
   and reassembly.  However, fragmentation and reassembly is still
   required at the adaptation layer, if the MAC layer cannot support the
   minimum MTU demanded by IPv6, which is 1280 octets.

   In IEEE 1901.1 and IEEE 1901.2, the MAC layer supports payloads as
   big as 2031 octets and 1576 octets respectively.  However, when the
   channel condition is noisy, smaller packets have higher transmission
   success rate, the operator can choose to configure smaller MTU at the
   MAC layer.  If the configured MTU is smaller than 1280 octets, the
   fragmentation and reassembly defined in [RFC4944] MUST be used.

   In ITU-T G.9903, the maximum MAC payload size is fixed to 400 octets,
   so to cope with the required MTU of 1280 octets by IPv6,
   fragmentation and reassembly at the 6lo adaptation layer MUST be
   provided as specified in [RFC4944].

   [RFC4944] uses a 16-bit datagram tag to identify the fragments of the
   same IP packet.  [RFC4963] specifies that at high data rates, the
   16-bit IP identification field is not large enough to prevent
   frequent incorrectly assembled IP fragments.  For constrained PLC,
   the data rate is much lower than the situation mentioned in RFC4963,
   thus the 16-bit tag is sufficient to assemble the fragments
   correctly.

5.  Internet Connectivity Scenarios and Topologies

   The PLC network model can be simplified to two kinds of network
   device: PAN Coordinator (PANC) and PLC Device.  The PANC is the
   primary coordinator of the PLC subnet and can be seen as a primary
   node; PLC Devices are typically PLC meters and sensors.  The address
   registration and DAD features can also be deployed on the PANC, for
   example the 6LBR [RFC6775] or the routing registrar in [RFC8505].
   IPv6 over PLC networks are built as trees, meshes or stars topology
   according to the use cases.  Generally, each PLC network has one
   PANC.  In some cases, the PLC network can have alternate coordinators
   to replace the PANC when the PANC leaves the network for some reason.
   Note that the PLC topologies in this section are based on logical
   connectivity, not physical links.  The term "PLC subnet" refers to a
   multilink subnet, in which the PLC devices share the same address
   prefix.

   The star topology is common in current PLC scenarios.  In single-hop
   star topologies, communication at the link layer only takes place
   between a PLC Device and a PANC.  The PANC typically collects data
   (e.g., a meter reading) from the PLC devices, and then concentrates
   and uploads the data through Ethernet or Cellular networks (see
   Figure 5).  The collected data is transmitted by the smart meters
   through PLC, aggregated by a concentrator, sent to the utility and
   then to a Meter Data Management System for data storage, analysis and
   billing.  This topology has been widely applied in the deployment of
   smart meters, especially in apartment buildings.

   A tree topology is useful when the distance between a device A and
   the PANC is beyond the PLC allowed limit and there is another device
   B in between able to communicate with both sides.  Device B in this

   case acts both as a PLC Device and a Coordinator.  For this scenario,
   the link layer communications take place between device A and device
   B, and between device B and PANC.  An example of a PLC tree network
   is depicted in Figure 6.  This topology can be applied in smart
   street lighting, where the lights adjust the brightness to reduce
   energy consumption while sensors are deployed on the street-lights to
   provide information such as light intensity, temperature, and
   humidity.  The data transmission distance in the street lighting
   scenario is normally above several kilometers, thus a PLC tree
   network is required.  A more sophisticated AMI network may also be
   constructed into the tree topology which is depicted in [RFC8036].  A
   tree topology is suitable for AMI scenarios that require large
   coverage but low density, e.g., the deployment of smart meters in
   rural areas.  RPL is suitable for maintenance of a tree topology in
   which there is no need for communication directly between PAN
   devices.

   Mesh networking in PLC is of great potential applications and has
   been studied for several years.  By connecting all nodes with their
   neighbors in communication range (see Figure 7), a mesh topology
   dramatically enhances the communication efficiency and thus expands
   the size of PLC networks.  A simple use case is the smart home
   scenario where the ON/OFF state of air conditioning is controlled by
   the state of home lights (ON/OFF) and doors (OPEN/CLOSE).  AODV-RPL
   ([I-D.ietf-roll-aodv-rpl]) enables direct PLC device to PLC device
   communication, without being obliged to transmit frames through the
   PANC, which is a requirement often cited for AMI infrastructure.

6.  Operations and Manageability Considerations

   The constrained PLC networks are not managed in the same way as an
   enterprise network or a carrier network.  Constrained PLC networks,
   like the other IoT networks, are designed to be self-organized and
   self-managed.  The software or firmware is flashed into the devices
   before deployment by the vendor or operator.  And during the
   deployment process, the devices are bootstrapped, and no extra
   configuration is needed to get the devices connected to each other.
   Once a device becomes offline, it goes back to the bootstrapping
   stage and tries to rejoin the network.  The onboarding status of the
   devices and the topology of the PLC network can be visualized via the
   PANC.  The recently-formed iotops WG in IETF is aiming to identify
   the requirements in IoT network management, and operational practices
   will be published.  Developers and operators of PLC networks should
   be able to learn operational experiences from this WG.

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations related to this document.

8.  Security Considerations

   Due to the high accessibility of power grids, PLC might be
   susceptible to eavesdropping within its communication coverage, e.g.,
   one apartment tenant may have the chance to monitor the other smart
   meters in the same apartment building.  Link layer security
   mechanisms, such as payload encryption and devcie authentication, are
   designed in the PLC technologies mentioned in this document.

   Malicious PLC devices could paralyze the whole network via DOS
   attacks, e.g., keep joining and leaving the network frequently, or
   sending multicast routing messages containing fake metrics.  A device
   may also inadvertently join a wrong or even malicious network,
   exposing its data to malicious users.  When communicating with a
   device outside the PLC network, the traffic has to go through the
   PANC.  Thus the PANC must be a trusted entity.  Moreover, the PLC
   network must prevent malicious devices to join in the network.  Thus
   Mutual authentication of a PLC network and a new device is important,
   and it can be conducted during the onboarding process of the new
   device.  Methods include protocols such as [RFC7925] (exchanging pre-
   installed certificates over DTLS), [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security]
   (which uses pre-shared keys), and
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-zerotouch-join] (a IoT version of BRSKI,
   which uses IDevID and MASA service to facilitate authentication).  It
   is also possible to use EAP methods such as [I-D.ietf-emu-eap-noob]
   via transports like PANA [RFC5191].  No specific mechanism is
   specified by this document, as an appropriate mechanism will depend
   upon deployment circumstances.  In some cases, the PLC devices can be
   deployed in uncontrolled places, where the devices may be accessed
   physically and be compromised via key extraction.  Since the
   compromised device may be still able to join in the network since its
   credentials are still valide.  When group-shared symmetric keys are
   used in the network, the consequence is even more severer, i.e., the
   whole network or a large part of the network is at risk.  Thus in
   scenarios where the physical attacks is considered to be relatively
   highly possible, per device credentials SHOULD be used.  Moreover,
   additional end-to-end security services" is a complementary to the
   network side security mechanisms, e.g., if a devices is compromised
   and it has joined in the network, and then it claims itself as the
   PANC and try to make the rest devices join its network.  In this
   situation, the real PANC can send an alarm to the operator to
   acknowledge the risk.  Other behavior analysis mechanisms can be
   deployed to recoginize the malicious PLC devices by inspecting the
   packets and the data.

   IP addresses may be used to track devices on the Internet; such
   devices can often in turn be linked to individuals and their
   activities.  Depending on the application and the actual use pattern,
   this may be undesirable.  To impede tracking, globally unique and
   non-changing characteristics of IP addresses should be avoided, e.g.,
   by frequently changing the global prefix and avoiding unique link-
   layer derived IIDs in addresses.  [RFC8065] discusses the privacy
   threats when interface identifiers (IID) are generated without
   sufficient entropy, including correlation of activities over time,
   location tracking, device-specific vulnerability exploitation, and
   address scanning.  And an effective way to deal with these threats is

Internet-Draft                IPv6 over PLC                December 2021


   Consider a PLC network with 1024 devices and its link lifetime is 8
   years, according to the formula in RFC8065, an entropy of 40 bits is
   sufficient.  Padding the short address (12 or 16 bits) to generate
   the IID of a routable IPv6 address in the public network may be
   vulnerable to deal with address scans.  Thus as suggest in the
   section 4.1, a hash function can be used to generate a 64 bits IID.
   When the version number of the PLC network is changed, the IPv6
   addresses can be changed as well.  Other schemes such as limited
   lease period in DHCPv6 [RFC8415], Cryptographically Generated
   Addresses (CGAs) [RFC3972], Temporary Address Extensions [RFC8981],
   Hash-Based Addresses (HBAs) [RFC5535], or semantically opaque
   addresses [RFC7217] SHOULD be used to enhance the IID privacy.
