Abstract

   This document specify how to compute data, "channel bindings", that
   is cryptographically bound to a specific Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) session.  The intention is to use this data as a name of the
   secure channel for the purpose of a channel binding.  The channel
   bindings can be used by authentication protocols to avoid tunneling
   attacks and security layer re-use.  The data is derived using the TLS
   Pseudo-Random Function (PRF).

Internet-Draft    Channel Bindings for TLS based on PRF      August 2008


1.  Introduction

   Binding authentication to a specific encrypted session can protect
   from certain attacks [mitm].  It can also help to improve performance
   by having peers agree to re-use a secure channel rather than to set
   up a new.

   This document describe how to generate data that can be used by
   application protocols to bind authentication to a specific TLS
   [RFC4346] session.


2.  Conventions Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Channel Bindings Syntax

   The channel bindings is computed using the TLS Pseudo-Random Function
   (PRF).  The PRF takes three inputs, a secret, a fixed label, and a
   seed.  Here the label will be "channel binding".  The key will be the
   master secret in a TLS session.  The seed will be the hash of the
   handshake messages, computed the same way as for the TLS Finished
   message.  We will use the first 32 octets computed by the PRF.

   Using the terminology and pseudo-language in TLS [RFC4346], the
   channel bindings is computed as follows:

    TLS_channel_bindings =
       PRF(SecurityParameters.master_secret,
           "channel binding",
           MD5(handshake_messages) + SHA-1(handshake_messages)) [0..31]

   The derived data MUST NOT be used for any other purpose than channel
   bindings as desribed in [RFC5056].


4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to register this channel binding using the
   following templates and the process described in [RFC5056].

   Subject: Registration of channel binding TLS

   Channel binding unique prefix (name): tls-unique-prf

5.  Security Considerations

   For the intended use and other important considerations, see
   [RFC5056].

   We claim that by appropriately using a channel binding an application
   can protect itself from the attacks in [mitm].  To guarantee this
   property, the derived data is only to be used for the intended
   purpose.

   The security considerations in TLS should be considered.  In
   particular, the TLS master secret must be protected.


6.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Eric Rescorla and Sam Hartman who pointed out a problem
   with the construct used in earlier versions of this document when TLS
   server authentication is not used or checked.
