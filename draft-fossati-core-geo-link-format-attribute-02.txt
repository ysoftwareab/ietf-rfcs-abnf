              A Link-Format Attribute for Locating Things
            draft-fossati-core-geo-link-format-attribute-02

Abstract

   This memo proposes a new CoAP link format attribute, "geo", that can
   be used to associate positioning metadata to a CoAP resource.  An
   extension to the link format query syntax is also suggested to allow
   the discovery of resources based on their geo location.

1.  Introduction

   The ability for a client application to access positioning
   information about a sensing resource is crucial in a number of use
   cases, e.g. those in which one or more sensor networks provide input
   to an emergency handling service (e.g. fire, flood, etc.).

   This memo proposes a new CoAP link-format attribute, "geo", that can
   be used to associate positioning metadata to a CoAP resource, and
   make this information available to other endpoints that, directly or
   indirectly, participate to CoAP link-format discovery [RFC6690].

   This spec reuses the geo URI syntax [RFC5870], which is capable of
   describing physical locations in two or three dimensions (also
   supporting underground and underwater localisation using negative
   numbers) in a simple, reasonably compact, and human readable way.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Use Cases

   Location-aware applications and location-based services like rescue
   systems in devastated areas, seismic networks, gas pipeline
   monitoring deployments, fire or flood detection systems, etc., need
   to precisely locate the source of sensed stimulus in order to react
   in a suitable way.  Smart city scenarios, e.g. street lights control,
   emergency services, often have similar needs.

Internet-Draft        The geo Link-Format Attribute         January 2014


3.  The geo Link Format Attribute

   This section defines a new Web Linking [RFC5988] link-param, "geo",
   to be used within the [RFC6690] framework, having the following
   syntax:

   link-extension  = "geo" "=" geo-path
   geo-path          ; defined in Section 3.3. of RFC 5870


   The geo attribute MUST NOT appear more than once in a link.

4.  Examples

   o  A fire detector somewhere in the Pollino National Park (approx.
      10cm accuracy, enough to distinguish trees from each other):

     REQ: GET /.well-known/core

     RES: 2.05 Content
     </fire>;ct=0;if="sensor";geo="40.00201,16.34007"


   o  An underwater current sampler in the sea between Ithaki and
      Kefallonia bearing explicit accuracy information (10m):

     REQ: GET /.well-known/core

     RES: 2.05 Content
     </water>;ct=0;if="sensor";geo="38.2953,20.6426,-20;u=10"


5.  Encoding Considerations

   This specification allows only one CRS, which is WGS-84.  There is no
   need to set an explicit crslabel when encoding a geo link-format
   attribute, since the default value wgs84 applies anyway.

   For further encoding consideration, see Section 3.5. of [RFC5870].

6.  Extended Geo Queries

   The query filtering rules defined in Section 4.1. of [RFC6690] are
   not particularly well suited for querying resources based on geo
   parameters.  Therefore, this memo specifies an extended set of query
   formatting and filtering rules specific for the geo attribute.

Internet-Draft        The geo Link-Format Attribute         January 2014


   By means of the "extended" geo query format, a client application can
   make resources pop up in link-format responses based on their
   location.

6.1.  Syntax

   The query parameters are the top left and the bottom right corners of
   a rectangular sector representing the query "capture" area.  The two
   points (top left, bottom right respectively) are expressed as comma-
   delimited latitude/longitude pairs, separated by a dash "-":

     "?geo=" latitude "," longitude "-" latitude "," longitude

     latitude    ; defined in Section 3.3. of RFC 5870
     longitude   ; defined in Section 3.3. of RFC 5870


6.2.  Filtering Rules

   An endpoint which understands the extended geo query format MUST
   respond to the query if and only if its latitude and longitude values
   fall in the latitude and longitude range defined by the query string.
   Any accuracy/uncertainty MUST be taken into consideration by the
   queried endpoint when running the match algorithm.

   For example, the "/water" resource in Section 4 would match the query
   "?geo=38.3000,20.6400-38.2900,20.6500"

7.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Keith Drage for comments and discussions that have helped
   shaping this document.

8.  IANA Considerations

   No formal request at present.  However, there is a plan to add a
   registry for the namespace of link parameters as part of [RFC5988]
   update.

9.  Security Considerations

   The "geo" link-format attribute shares the same security issues as
   any other attribute involved in the discovery process described in
   [RFC6690].

   Further to that, the privacy considerations regarding distribution,
   protection, usage, retention, and storage of the location information
   of the target resource found in [RFC6280] fully apply.
