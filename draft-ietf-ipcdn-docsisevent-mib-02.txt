Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-
   based event notification management of DOCSIS compliant Cable Modems
   and Cable Modem Termination Systems. This MIB is defined as an
   extension to the DOCSIS Cable Device MIB, RFC 2669.

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the
   SMIv2.  The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP framework and

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Glossary

   The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable
   system usage, or from the documents associated with the Data Over
   Cable Service Interface Specification process.

2.1.  BPI - Baseline Privacy Interface

   A term referring to the DOCSIS specification [BPI] for enabling
   simple data privacy in the DOCSIS 1.0 system.

INTERNET-DRAFT       DOCSIS Event Notification MIB          January 2003


2.2.  BPI+ - Baseline Privacy Plus Interface

   A term referring to the DOCSIS specification [BPI+] for enabling CM
   authentication and data privacy in the DOCSIS 1.1 system.

2.3.  CATV

   Originally "Community Antenna Television", now used to refer to any
   cable or hybrid fiber and cable system used to deliver video signals
   to a community.

2.4.  CM - Cable Modem

   A CM acts as a "slave" station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data
   system.

2.5.  CMTS - Cable Modem Termination System

   A generic term covering a cable bridge or cable router in a head-end.
   A CMTS acts as the master station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data
   system.  It is the only station that transmits downstream, and it
   controls the scheduling of upstream transmissions by its associated
   CMs.

2.6.  DOCSIS

   "Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications".  A term referring
   to the ITU-T J.112 Annex B standard for cable modem systems [RFI1.0],
   commonly known as DOCSIS 1.0.  The DOCSIS 1.1 specification is an
   extension of DOCSIS 1.0, with new features to support quality of
   service, fragmentation, and requirements for European cable plants
   [RFI1.1].

   DOCSIS 2.0 [RFI2.0] builds upon DOCSIS 1.1, and provides all of the
   features and functionality that DOCSIS 1.1 provides. In addition, it
   provides some significant enhancements in upstream capacity over
   DOCSIS 1.1. such as 30.72 Mbps maximum upstream channel capacity,
   Synchronous- CDMA operation, increased robustness to upstream noise
   and channel impairments, Enhanced Reed-Solomon error correction, and
   Trellis Coded Modulation.

2.7.  Downstream

   The direction from the head-end towards the subscriber.

2.8.  Head-end

   The origination point in most cable systems of the subscriber video

   signals. Generally also the location of the CMTS equipment.

2.9.  MAC Packet

   A DOCSIS PDU.

2.10.  RF

   Radio Frequency.

2.11  SID

   Service ID. The SID identifies a particular upstream bandwidth
   allocation and class-of-service management for DOCSIS, and identifies
   a particular bidirectional security association for BPI.

2.12.  Upstream

   The direction from the subscriber towards the head-end.

3.  Overview

   High Speed Internet Service offering in cable industry has become
   extremely successful. DOCSIS devices including CM and CMTS are being
   deployed at a rate of multiple thousands per day. Although operators
   are enjoyinging successful deployment, they are also facing a
   challenge to properly manage deployed devices.  Operators are using
   Simple Network Management Protocol, a set of Management Information
   Base (MIB) required by DOCSIS, and SNMP Traps to manage deployed
   DOCSIS devices.  The usage of SNMP Trap for event reporting is
   becoming more popular as an effective and efficient method for
   network monitoring.

   Unfortunately, only a minimal set of SNMP Traps is currently
   available. This notification MIB in conjunction with [OSS1.1] /
   [OSS2.0] provide a minimum set of standard DOCSIS Traps that DOCSIS
   devices will support to enable successful management of DOCSIS
   devices and network.

   This document definess a set of objects required for the event
   notification management of DOCSIS compliant Cable Modems (CMs) and
   Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTSs). The specification is derived
   from the DOCSIS Operations Support System Interface Specification
   [OSS1.1] and [OSS2.0].

   The Appendix H of [OSS1.1] defines all DOCSIS 1.1 required events and
   the Appendix D of [OSS2.0] does that for DOCSIS 2.0.  The
   notifications specified in this document are used to notify these

INTERNET-DRAFT       DOCSIS Event Notification MIB          January 2003


   events via SNMP.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.1.  Structure of the MIB

   The notification part of DOCS-CABLE-DEVICE-MIB of RFC 2669 [RFC2669]
   was left empty for further enhancement. The DOCS-CABLE-DEVICE-TRAP-
   MIB was designed to fulfill this role and therefore completes RFC
   2669 in this regard.

   Two groups of SNMP notification objects are defined in this document.
   One group defines notifications for cable modem events, and the other
   group defines notifications for cable modem termination system
   events.

   Common to all CM notification objects (traps) is that in their
   OBJECTS statements, a CM trap contains information about the event
   priority, the event Id, the event message body, the CM DOCSIS
   capability, the CM DOCSIS register status, the cable interface MAC
   address of the cable modem and the CMTS cable card MAC address to
   which the cable modem is connected to.

   Common to all CMTS notification objects (traps) is that in their
   OBJECTS statements, a CMTS trap contains information about the event
   priority, the event Id, the event message body,  the connected CM
   DOCSIS register status, the CM cable interface MAC address, the CMTS
   DOCSIS register status and the CMTS cable card MAC address.

3.2.  Event Throttling

   SNMP event throttling is controlled as described in RFC 2669
   [RFC2669].

               "The CABLE DEVICE TRAP MIB is an extension of the
                CABLE DEVICE MIB defined in RFC2669. It defines various

                objects are defined. One group is for notifying cable
                modem events and one group for notifying cable modem
                termination system events. Common to all CM
                notification objects (traps) is that their OBJECTS
                statements contain information about the event priority,
                the event Id, the event message body, the CM DOCSIS
                capability, the CM DOCSIS QOS level, the CM DOCSIS
                upstream modulation type, the cable interface MAC
                address of the cable modem and the cable card MAC address
                of the CMTS to which the modem is connectede.

                These objects are docsDevEvLevel, docsDevId,
                docsDevEvText, docsIfDocsisBaseCapability,
                docsIfCmStatusDocsisOperMode, docsIfCmStatusModulationType
                ifPhysAddress and docsIfCmCmtsAddress. The values of
                docsDevEvLevel, docsDevId, and docsDevEvText are from the
                entry which logs this event in the docsDevEventTable, which
                is defined in DOCS-CABLE-DEVICE-MIB of RFC2669. The
                docsIfDocsisBaseCapability, docsIfCmStatusDocsisOperMode,
                and docsIfCmStatusModulationType are defined in the DOCS-IF-MIB.
                The ifPhysAddress value is the MAC address of the cable
                interface of this cable modem. The docsIfCmCmtsAddress
                specifies the MAC address of the CMTS (if there is a cable
                card/ interface in the CMTS, then it is actually the
                cable interface interface MAC address to which the CM is
                connected).  Individual CM trap may contain additional
                objects to provide necessary information.

                Common to all CMTS notification objects (traps) is that
                their OBJECTS statements contain information about the
                event priority, the event Id, the event message body,
                the connected CM DOCSIS QOS status, the connected CM DOCSIS
                modulation type, the CM cable interface MAC address, the
                CMTS DOCSIS capability, and the CMTS MAC address.

                These objects are docsDevEvLevel, docsDevId, docsDevEvText,
                docsIfCmtsCmStatusDocsisRegMode,
                docsIfCmtsCmStatusModulationType,
                docsIfCmtsCmStatusMacAddress, docsIfDocsisBaseCapability, and
                ifPhysAddress. The values of docsDevEvLevel, docsDevId, and
                docsDevEvText are similar to those in CM traps. The values of
                docsIfCmtsCmStatusDocsisRegMode,
                docsIfCmtsCmStatusModulationType, and
                docsIfCmtsCmStatusMacAddress are from the
                docsIfCmtsCmStatusEntry (defined in DOCS-IF-MIB) corresponding
                to a connected CM. The docsIfDocsisBaseCapability indicates the
                CMTS DOCSIS capability. The ifPhysAddress value is the CMTS MAC
                address (if there is a cable card/ interface in the CMTS, then

            the upstream modulation methodology used by the CM.
            The ifPhysAddress value is the MAC address of the cable
            interface of this cable modem.
            The docsIfCmCmtsAddress specifies the MAC address
            of the CMTS to which the CM is connected (if there is a cable
            card/ interface in the CMTS, then it is actually the MAC address
            of the cable interface which connected to the CM).
            This part of information is uniformed across all CM traps.

8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    Setting docsDevCmTrapControl or docsDevCmtsTrapControl may

        cause flooding of traps, which can disrupt network service.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
