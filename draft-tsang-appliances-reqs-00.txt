Abstract 
    
   Today, there are a variety of technologies available to network 
   appliances and provide degrees of home automation and control.  
   However, there is a lack of support for wide-area access control and 
   interworking of these Networked Appliances (NA).  The ability to 
   provide such support will radically enhance people∆s ability to 
   provide exciting new services.  This document outlines a set of 
   requirements for providing such support. 
    
    
1. Introduction

Internet Draft     Networked Appliance Requirements     September 2000 
 
1.1  Networked Appliances 
    
   The next wave of the Internet is widely predicted to be the Networked 
   Appliance (NA) - the refrigerator that can keep an inventory of your 
   groceries and re-order when necessary or perhaps the alarm clock that 
   can co-ordinate your agenda, check the weather and the road 
   conditions to determine the correct time to wake you up. It is clear 
   that these appliances will need to communicate amongst themselves.  
   For example, an alarm clock may be configured to switch on the 
   bedroom lights at 7am as a wake-up indication to the user. 
    
   The term Networked Appliance (NA) is difficult to define as it can 
   cover a very large range of devices.  However, for the purposes of 
   this document, a Networked Appliance is defined as being a dedicated 
   function consumer devices containing at least one networked 
   processor.  Examples of NAs include:  lamps, refrigerators, toasters, 
   and TVs. 
    
   There are numerous networking technologies which allow the scenarios 
   outlined above to be realized within a single home or administrative 
   domain.  Some examples are X.10 [6], HAVi [2], VHN [3], and UPnP [4].   
    
   However, there is currently no support for wide-area access control 
   of these networked appliances from the Internet, or for interworking 
   the various home networking technologies.  The ability to provide 
   such support will radically enhance the ability to provide exciting 
   new services.   
    
   For example, before leaving the office, a user could contact his (or 
   her) home and ask it to pre-heat the oven, record the news on TV, and 
   set the house temperature to 70 degrees F.  While on a business trip, 
   a plumber comes to the house to fix a leaky sink.  The user is 
   notified when the plumber rings the doorbell and a camera at the door 
   transmits an image of the plumber to the user∆s laptop PC.  The 
   plumber∆s ID card has an electronic signature which is also 
   transmitted with the image and verified by the user∆s client 
   software.  The user remotely unlocks the door and allows the plumber 
   in, all the while viewing and conversing with the plumber via micro-
   cameras and microphones in the home. 
    
   This document outlines a set of requirements for providing Networked 
   Appliance wide-area accessibility and interworking.  Required 
   capabilities include:  control of NAs, event subscription and 
   notification, and remote sensor reading.  
    
    
1.2  Example Home Network Environment 
    
   Figure 1 shows an example of a possible Home Network environment.  
   Within the home, a variety of home networking technologies are used 
   (X.10, HAVi, 802.11).  An IP-based Local Area Network (LAN) 
   interconnects the various networks.  Access to the wider Internet is

   provided through a Residential Gateway (RGW).  The RGW may optionally 
   provide additional functions such as firewall and Network Address 
   Translator (NAT). 
    
   Each Home Environment has a domain name given to the RGW for access 
   to or from appliances and devices with the home.  For example, this 
   could be in the form of example_user.example_home.net or for precise 
   appliance addressing, 
   example_appliance.example_user.example_home.net.  The domain name 
   will be used to address users and appliances networked behind the 
   RGW.

1.3  Interworking Different Networks in the Home Environment 
    
   Figure 2 illustrates how different networks within the home 
   environment may communicate with each other and the RGW over the LAN 
   via an interworking protocol.   
    
   Home networking technologies which do not communicate using IP are 
   connected to the home LAN via an Appliance Controller.  Appliance 
   Controllers provide interworking between home networking technologies 
   and IP, and may additionally provide application layer interworking.  
   Appliance Controllers should operate transparently. 
    
   It is envisaged that Appliance Controllers will be required for every 
   home networking technology used in the home environment (such as HAVi 
   and X.10 as illustrated in Figure 2).

4. General Requirements 
    
   4.1  Wide-area accessibility of Networked Appliances. 
    
   4.1.1  NAs must be accessible from outside of the home environment.   
    
   4.1.2  For NAs without IP networking capabilities, an Appliance 
   Controller should be used to provide interworking between the NA and 
   the IP network. 
    
   4.1.3  Only a subset of NAs need to be addressable outside of the 
   home. It should be possible to query the home in some way to find 
   those that are. 
    
   4.2  Protocol transparency and independence.   
    
   4.2.1  It must be possible to interwork between different in-home 
   networking technologies transparently.  This requirement applies to 
   both physical networking (e.g., X.10 [6], 802.3, 802.11, Bluetooth 
   [7]) and application networking technologies. (e.g., HAVi [2], UPnP 
   [4], Jini [5], Salutation [8]).   
    
   4.3  Personal mobility support. 
    
   4.3.1  Networked Appliances must be able to move within the home 
   domain, across home domains, within the service provider's domain, 
   and across service provider domains.

Internet Draft     Networked Appliance Requirements     September 2000 
 
   4.3.2  Support must be provided for locating and controlling 
   Networked Appliances as they move across different home environments 
   and networks. 
    
   4.4  Configuration. 
    
   4.4.1  Networked Appliances should (as far as possible) be auto-
   configuring.  There should be minimal user interaction, though users 
   should be allowed to manually configure their appliances if desired. 
    
   4.5  Usage Monitoring and Charging 
    
   4.5.1  The home networking environment may optionally allow usage 
   records to be created at a variety of granularity levels.  For 
   example, usage records may be created on a per session or per message 
   basis. 
    
    
5. Naming & Addressing Requirements 
    
   5.1  NAs must be assigned a generic addressing format which can be 
   used to refer to it by any communicating entity. 
    
   5.1.1  NAs may have global IP addresses or local IP addresses (in the 
   case when NAs are behind a firewall or proxy). 
    
   5.1.2  In the cases when NAs are not IP-based, the NAs must be 
   assigned a generic address. 
    
   5.2  There must be support for classification of addresses and 
   selection between multiple instances.  For example, it must be 
   possible to search for Êall lamps∆ or to allow refinement of a search 
   for a particular lamp. 
    
   5.3  Since the specific name for a NA may not be known, a mechanism 
   must exist to Êsearch∆ for the NA using a well-known language/naming 
   schema. 
    
   5.4  The addressing scheme MUST use UTF-8 for character 
   representation. 
    
    
6. Communication Protocol Requirements 
    
   6.1  The communication protocol must provide a flexible payload 
   capability which will allow the transport of commands to, and 
   responses from, individual NAs or classes of NAs.  More explicitly, 
   there must be a separation of transport and data. 
    
   6.2  The protocol must provide reliability against all forms of 
   communication errors.  This includes both short Êglitches∆ and long 
   term Êbreakdowns∆.  If the communication breakdown is unrecoverable, 
 
S. Tsang et al                                                [Page 6] 
 

 
Internet Draft     Networked Appliance Requirements     September 2000 
 
   the protocol must be able to signal this to the communicating 
   entities. 
    
   6.3  The protocol must support efficient messaging for control.  It 
   is expected that control messages for NAs will be short and 
   optionally may not form part of an ongoing dialogue.  These messages 
   should therefore be delivered in the form of datagrams (sessionless) 
   but with reliable semantics. 
    
   6.4  The protocol must support event subscription and notification 
   (e.g., the ability to be notified when a lamp is switched on or off). 
    
   6.5  The protocol must support the ability to obtain the output of 
   remote sensors (e.g., the output from temperature sensors). 
    
   6.4  The communication protocol must be able to encapsulate various 
   appliances characteristics.  For example, some appliances may act and 
   respond immediately, while others may only respond after a non-
   determinate amount of time. 
    
    
7. Communication Mode Requirements 
    
   7.1  Support for the following communications modes is required:   
    
   7.1.1  Control: for example ÊTurn on the outside light∆. 
    
   7.1.2  Queries (e.g., of device state): for example ÊWhat is the 
   temperature in the house?∆. 
    
   7.1.3  Asynchronous events (Ênotification∆): for example ÊNotify me 
   when the security alarm goes off∆. 
    
   7.1.4  Discovery: for example ÊWhat device can meet requirement x?∆. 
    
   7.1.5  Support Media streaming (sessions): for example ÊView the 
   babysitter-cam∆. 
    
    
8. Security Considerations  
    
   Interconnecting home appliances to each other and especially to 
   devices outside the home environment introduces a serious possibility 
   of Êinternet theft∆. It may now be possible for a rogue entity to 
   gain control of home appliances in a way that is very adverse to the 
   home owner.  The importance of having a strong security policy is of 
   prime importance in such a network.  This section highlights security 
   requirements that will need to be followed for such a network.  Note 
   that while it is important to protect shared appliances, it is 
   equally important to decide which devices are to be shared by 
   external entities.

Internet Draft     Networked Appliance Requirements     September 2000 
 
   8.1  Authentication, authorization, privacy, and replay protection 
   are required in all communications. 
    
   8.1.1  It should be possible to check communications with devices 
   from the wide area at different granularity levels.  Examples 
   include:  once per session, per message, or periodically. 
    
   8.2  The contents and device name of the messages must be kept 
   private so that eavesdroppers cannot learn about what is in people's 
   homes. 
    
   8.3  When Networked Appliances move into environments other than 
   their home environment, the visiting appliances and their users must 
   be authenticated and authorized.

   levels.  Examples include:  per registration (visit), per message or 
   periodically. 
    
   8.4  Support for audit capabilities may optionally be supported so 
   that traceback and fault control can be performed.

   communications. 
    
   8.6  Resilience under security attacks. 
    
   8.6.1  It should be possible to dynamically isolate NAs within the 
   home environment selectively or completely from external networks.   
    
   8.6.2  The appliances must be able to perform a minimum of functions 
   correctly, even in the absence of external communications.
