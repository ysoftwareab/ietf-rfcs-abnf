                                 (NSF)
               draft-zhang-i2nsf-info-model-monitoring-01

Abstract

   The Network Security Functions (NSF) Capability interface exists
   between the Service Provider's management system (or Security
   Controller) and the NSFs to enforce the rule provisioning and
   monitoring on the NSFs in the functional implementation level.This
   document focuses on the monitoring part of it and proposes the
   information model for it.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated-Title                  July 2016


1.  Introduction

   According to [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-framework], the interface provided by a
   NSF (e.g., FW, AAA, IPS, Anti- DDOS, or Anti-Virus) for other network
   entities (e.g., NMS, security controller) to enforce the rule
   provisioning and monitoring on the NSF is referred to as a
   'capability interface'.  The monitoring part of the capability
   interface is meant to monitor the network events and the execution
   status of the NSFs, then aggregate and analyze them to learn what is
   happening and send a report to the administrator.  Regarding to
   monitoring, the NSF can communicate with the security controller
   though the capability interface in either a 'push' or a 'pull' way.
   The NSF can send out a report about its status or about certain
   network event proactively or send out message as a reply to security
   controller who control or monitor it.  This document will not go into
   the design details of capability interface.  Instead, this draft is
   focused on specifying the information that a NSF needs to provide in
   the monitoring part of the capability interface, as well as its
   information model.  Besides, [I-D.draft-xia-i2nsf-capability-
   interface-im] specifies the information model for the rule
   provisioning part of the capability interface.

   In this document, the following types of security information that a
   NSF needs to provide are considered:

   o  The alarm triggered by a certain status in NSF

   o  The alarm triggered by a certain security event

   o  The report about the security events occured in a certain period

   o  The report about the status of NSF in a certain period

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Definition of Terms

   This document uses the terms defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-i2nsf-
   terminology].

      Critical; 3 - Error; 4 - Warning; 5 - Notification; 6 -
      Informational; 7 - Debugging.

4.  Alarm

5.2.3.  DPI Report

   DPI reports provide statistics on uploaded and downloaded files and
   data, sent and received emails, and alert and block records on
   websites.  It's helpful to learn risky user behaviors and why access
   to some URLs is blocked or allowed with an alert record.

   o  policy_name: Security policy name that traffic matches

   o  action: Action defined in the file blocking rule, data filtering
      rule, or application behavior control rule that traffic matches.

5.2.4.  Vulnerabillity Scanning Report

   Vulnerability scanning reports record the victim host and its related
   vulnerability information that should to be fixed. the following
   information should be included in the report:

   o  victim_ip: IP address of the victim host which has vulnerabilities

   o  vulnerability_id: The vulnerability id

   o  vulnerability_level: The vulnerability level. e.g., high, middle,
      low

   o  fix_suggestion: The fix suggestion to the vulnerability.

5.2.5.  User Activity Report

   User activity reports provide visibility into users' online records
   (such as login time, online/lockout duration, and login IP addresses)
   and the actions users perform.  User activity reports are helpful to
   identify exceptions during user login and network access activities.

   o  content: Operation performed by an administrator after login.

5.3.2.  Running Report

   Running reports record the device system's running status, which is
   useful for device monitoring.  The following information should be
   included in running report:
