Abstract

   BGP flow specification (RFC5575) describes the distribution policy
   that contains filters and actions that apply when packets are
   received on a router with the flow specification function turned on.
   The popularity of these flow specification filters in deployment for
   DoS and SDN/NFV has led to the requirement for more BGP flow
   specification match filters in the NLRI and more BGP flow
   specification actions.  Two solutions exist for adding new filters:
   1) expanding the BGP Flow Specification version 1 (NLRI match filters
   and extended communities actions) to included limited number of
   filters and actions, and 2) creating a BGP Flow Specification version
   2 that allows for ordering filters and actions (using new NLRI and
   wide-communities for actions).  The two solutions can exist in
   parallel.

   This document contains an overview existing proposals for expansion
   of BGP flow specification policy, proposals for BGP Flow
   Specification v1 and a new BGP Flow specification version 2 that
   supports order of filters and actions plus allowing more actions.
   This document also provides rules for the interaction of IDR Flow
   Specification policy (session ephemeral policy) with policy found in
   I2RS (reboot ephemeral policy), and policy found in ACLs and Policy
   routing (configuration policy).  This document does not contain the
   individual definitions of policy rule conditions or actions.

1.  Introduction

   BGP flow specification (RFC5575) describes the distribution of
   filters and actions that apply when packets are received on a router
   with the flow specification function turned on.  If one considers the
   reception of the packet as an event, then BGP flow specification
   describes a set of minimalistic Event-MatchCondition-Action (ECA)
   policies.  The initial set of policy (RFC5575 and RFC7674) for this
   policy includes 12 types of match filters encoded in the NLRI for two
   types of SAFIs (IP-only SAFI, 133; VPN SAFI, 134) for IPv4.  The
   popularity of these flow specification filters in deployment for DoS
   and SDN/NFV has led to the requirement for more BGP flow
   specification match filters in the NLRI and more BGP flow
   specification actions.

   Two solutions exist for adding new filters: 1) expanding the BGP Flow
   Specification (NLRI match filters and extended communities actions)
   for a limited number of filters and actions, and 2) creating a BGP
   Flow Specification version 2 that allows for ordering filters and
   actions (using new NLRI and wide-communities
   [I-D.ietf-idr-wide-bgp-communities] for actions).  The two solutions

   can exist in parallel.  This document contains an overview of both
   solutions, rules for combining new flow specification policies which
   support IPv6, L2, nvo03 and MPLS match filters and new actions, and
   suggestions on how to expand yang modules to monitor both types.
   This document also provides rules for the interaction of IDR Flow
   Specification policy (session ephemeral policy) with policy found in
   I2RS (reboot ephemeral policy), and policy found in ACLs and Policy
   routing (configuration policy).  This document does not contain the
   individual definitions of policies whcih are contained in the other
   specifications.

   Section 1 of this draft contains an introduction to BGP flow
   specification [RFC5575] and drafts expanding the RFC5575 state.
   Section 2 contains the definitions related to this draft.  Section 3
   provides an overview of existing and proposed flow specification
   policy rules decribed in terms of packet event, packet match
   conditions, and actions (packet forwarding or packet match).  The
   flow specification policies reviewed include policy in RFCs
   ([RFC5575], [RFC7674]), IDR WG documents
   ([I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6], [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn]), and the
   following proposed IDR WG documents

   o  [I-D.eddy-idr-flowspec-packet-rate] (traffic limiting by packet
      rate),

   o  [I-D.eddy-idr-flowspec-exp] (Extensions for BGP security and
      others),

   o  [I-D.hao-idr-flowspec-nvo3] (flow specification for inner/outer
      nv03 forwarding),

   o  [I-D.hao-idr-flowspec-redirect-tunnel] (redirect to tunnel),

   o  [I-D.liang-idr-bgp-flowspec-label] MPLS label related filters and
      actions,

   o  [I-D.liang-idr-bgp-flowspec-time] Filters by time,

   o  [I-D.litkowski-idr-flowspec-interfaceset]Filters applied by order
      for Interface group, and

   o  [I-D.vandevelde-idr-flowspec-path-redirect]Filters applied to
      packet identifier,

   Section 4 describes a proposal for an enhancement of BGP Flow
   specification security for both proosal.  This security enhancement
   suggests using BGP ROA and allows the addition of BGP security to

   validate the AS Path or AS Extended Communities and AS Wide
   Communities.

   Section 5 describes the minimal subset solution with:

   o  summary of NLRI and extended community formats (xection 5.1)

   o  security addition of ROA (section 5.2),

   o  match filter list and precedence of match filters (section 5.3),

   o  action list and precedence of actions(section 5.4),

   o  conflict with other Packet-reception Event-MatchCondition-Action
      (ECA) policy (I2RS Filter-Based RIB and Policy-Based Routing
      (n-tuple forwarding)) (section 5.9),

   o  pros-cons of this approach (section 5.10)

   Section 6 contains the BGP Flow specification with the sub-sections
   as section 4 except that section one summarizes the new NRLI with
   ordering of filters, and wide community atoms.

   Section 7 proposes changes to the proposed Flow Specification Yang
   Module ([I-D.wu-idr-flowspec-yang-cfg].  yang modules in order to
   provide common monitoring of BGP Flow Specification version 1 and
   version 2.  The changes suggest include changes to:

   o  local configuration of BGP Flow Specification to be distributed to
      remote peers,

   o  storage of bgp policy received from remote BGP peers [operational
      state],

   o  statistics on use of locally configured BGP Flow Specification and
      remotely configured BGP Flow specification [operational state].

   In addition, this section suggests ways to store BGP Flow
   Specification that will aid in comparing the BGP Flow Specification
   with other packet-reception ECA policy.

   Section 9 discusses the security considerations for all the BGP Flow
   Specifications.

1.1.  Overview of RFC5575

   [RFC5575] describes the dissemination of flow specification rules via
   groups BGP Multi-Protocol NLRIs and BGP communities.  A flow
   specification operates on packets received in a router when the flow
   specification feature is configured.  The flow specification
   specifies match conditions for filters for packets received by a
   router and actions to do based on a match of those filters.  If one
   considers the reception of a packet as an event, then a BGP flow
   specifications can be considered a set of minimalistic Event-Match
   Condition-Action policies (ECA policies).  This set is minimalistic
   because there is only one event - the reception of a packet.  BGP
   Flow specifications are BGP policy passed between peers.

   The BGP flow specification policy is specified in filters contained
   in the MP-BGP NLRIs and actions contained within BGP Extended
   communities.  The BGP peer propagates the flow-specifications between
   domains in order to automate inter-domain coordination of traffic
   filtering.  Two applications that are using this are: distributed
   denial of service attack suppression and traffic filtering in BGP/
   MPLS VPN service.  BGP.  BGP flow specifications use SAFI 133 non-VPN
   flow specifications, and SAFI 134 for BGP VPN flow specificatinos.

   BGP Flow specification are validated based on:

      a) originator of flow specification matching the originator of the
      best-match unicast route for the destination prefix embedded in
      the flow specification, and

      b) no more specific unicast routes, when compared with flow
      destination prefix, that have been received from differenting
      neighboring AS than the best-match unicast route

   Originator is specified by BGP originator path attribute or transport
   address of the BGP peer sending the BGP Flow specification.  To
   support BGP flow specification, implementations are required to
   enforce the neighbor AS in the AS_PATH attribute is in the left-most
   position of AS_PATH.

   Match operators includes a sequence of match operations each with the
   form [op, value] where match can match values greater, lessthan, or
   equal to teh value.  The sequence of match operators can be combined
   as logical AND or ORs.

1.2.  Flow Specifications: Ephemeral or not?

   BGP Flow specification does not indicate what happens to the flow
   specifications if a BGP peering session closes.  [RFC5575] specifies
   a link to received "best-match" unicast routes, but does not provide
   any standard way of determining whether the flow specification sent
   by the BGP peer is kept after the BGP session closes.  It is unclear
   whether BGP Flow specifications disappear when a BGP session closes
   (denoted as BGP session ephemeral), or disapppear when the BGP

   module's hardware or software reboots (reboot ephemeral), or it is
   kept like configuration state that survives a reboot.

   This document specifies that the default policy is that the BGP Flow
   Specification received from remote peers like other BGP peer state
   received from remote peers disappears when the BGP peer session
   closes.  Local BGP Peer configuration is like all local configuration
   and persists while the BGP Peer is configured.

   If an implementation decides to implement operator-applied policy
   that retains remotely received BGP Flow Specification policy after
   the BGP Peer closes, this action must be treated as if these BGP Flow
   Specification policy was locally configured.  Therefore, these two
   actions are out of scope of this document.

1.3.  Precedence between BGP Flow Specification and other packet-ECA
      policies

   Why is this precedence bewteen BGP Flow Specification and other
   packet-ECA policies needed?

   [RFC5575] states that Flow specification takes advantage of the "ACL"
   feature (section 1), but it does not state how BGP Flow specification
   interacts with ACL features.  NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf] can be used to set ACL configuration
   state using the [I-D.ietf-netmod-acl-model] yang data module.

   One of the proposals for a new BGP Flow specification action
   ([I-D.litkowski-idr-flowspec-interfaceset]) proposes an action which
   defines that a specific ordering of BGP flow-specifications and ACLs
   interaction for a set of interfaces for the drop/forward actions (see
   section 3 for details).  This action proposals suggests a precedence
   between these two filter actions.

   ACL is not the only packet-ECA policy used as an alternative to
   destination based routing.  Two other n-tuple packet-reception ECA
   modules exist: n-tuple policy-based RIB/FIB (aka policy routing) and
   I2RS Filter-based RIB.  The n-tuple policy based forwarding RIB/FIB
   configured on specific interfaces, and forward based on the match of
   an n-tuple filter that modifies, forwards, or drop n-tuples.  If no
   match exists, this packet-reception ECA RIB forward this to a default
   RIB.  A proposal for standardized yang model for this is in (draft-
   rtgwg-hares-rtgwg-fb-rib-00.txt).

   The I2RS Filter-Based RIB (FB-RIB) also specifies another way to do
   flow filtering per packet/frame being received (n-tuple packet ECA
   policy) ([I-D.kini-i2rs-fb-rib-info-model],
   [I-D.hares-i2rs-fb-rib-data-model]) using a packet filter event-

   match_condition-action policy [I-D.hares-i2rs-pkt-eca-data-model].
   The I2RS protocol allows a I2RS Client to talk to an I2RS Agent
   within a routing device ([I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture]) to set
   ephemermal policy which is module ephemeral and box ephemeral.  The
   I2RS match_conditions examine frame/packet information (L1-L4, NV03,
   and SFC), and I2RS match_actions that modify packet/frame
   information.  Figure 2 shows the structure of packet filtering ECA
   rules from [I-D.hares-i2rs-fb-rib-data-model] which used by I2RS
   Filter-Based RIB (FB-RIB).  Note that these I2RS Filters have each
   rule has policy rule name, policy rule order number, and rule status.

   Section 5 compares the filters and actions between BGP Flow
   Specification, I2RS Filter-Based RIB, Filter-RIB (aka Policy-Based
   Routing), and the ACL.  The I2RS packet filter rules also allow the
   rule to be ordered and named.  I2RS flow-based filters are ephemeral
   state [I-D.ietf-i2rs-ephemeral-state] are stored as ephemeral state
   which is lost upon a reboot.

1.4.  BGP Flow Specification and logging

   [RFC5575] specifies the Traffic Action Extended Community which
   specifies a Terminal (T) action flag and Sampling (S) flag.  The
   sample flag indicates that "traffic sampling and logging" [is
   enabled] for a set of flow specifications in a BGP packet.  the
   details of traffic sampling and logging are not specified in this
   standard.  Logging and sampling provide valuable information to
   establish the impact of BGP Flow specification in order to automatic
   intra-AS DoS prevention or inter-AS automation of DOS or VPN traffic
   filters.  [RFC5575] was written before the advent of yang modules
   that specify operational state [I-D.ietf-netmod-opstate-reqs].
   [I-D.wu-idr-flowspec-yang-cfg] proposes a BGP Flow Specification Yang
   Data model with BGP Flow Specification configuration, operational
   state for BGP Flow specifications received from peers (BGP Session
   Ephemeral state), and statistics on the use of filters, actions, and
   dropped packets.  Section 7 describes how the logging and
   notifications for BGP Flow specifications can be added to this yang
   module.

1.5.  BGP Flow Specification and BGPSEC

   [RFC5575] does not require BGP Flow specifications to be passed
   BGPSEC [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol].  [RFC5575] states "as long as
   traffic filtering rules are restricted to match the corresponding
   unicast routing paths for relevant prefixes, the security
   characteristics of this protocol are equivalent to existing security
   properties of BGP unicast properties", and "where this is not the
   case, this would open the door to further denial of service attack"
   (section 10).  [I-D.eddy-idr-flowspec-exp] suggests passing BGP Flow
   Specification in BGPSEC.  Section 10 summarizes the security issues
   with the current [RFC5575] and the enhancements described in this
   draft, and discusses the proposed fixes that that
   [I-D.eddy-idr-flowspec-exp] provides.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  BGP Flow Specification Policy - Original and Expansions

3.1.  Packet Reception Event

   The reception of a packet is the event that causes the BGP policy to
   enact.  By default the BGP Flow specification applies to all
   interfaces.  This can be restricted by a BGP Flow Specification
   Action or policy local to a node running the BGP peer session.

   The definition of a packet is not limited to a IP packet (IPv4 or
   IPv6) but also includes mpls packets, L2 frames (802.1Q),
   encapsulated packets (NVGRE or VXLAN or any other NV03
   encapsulation).

   The same definition of the event is utilized by the I2RS Filter-based
   RIBs ([I-D.kini-i2rs-fb-rib-info-model] and
   [I-D.hares-i2rs-fb-rib-data-model] and the Filter-Based RIBs (draft-
   hares-rtgwg-fb-rib-data-model), and ACL filters
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-acl-model].

   These packet events are the standardized packet events.  Additional
   packet events for vendors may augment these standards events.

3.2.  BGP Flow Specification Match Filters

   [RFC5575] defines match conditions for IPv4 to be carried with the
   NLRI format for 12 types of packet match events (see figure 3), and
   that all filters specified must be combined by a "AND".  The proposed
   expansions to this filter list utilizing the Flow Specification NLRI
   are listed in figure 4.  [I-D.li-idr-flowspec-rpd] proposed a BGP

   Attribute which contains additional flow specification filters, and
   actions.  Figure 5 contains the match filters from this draft.

   The proposals to expand flow specification beyond [RFC5575] filter
   specifications include:

      Matches for the inner-outer header for encapsulated traffic for
      being specified for the NV03 networks (MF-1, MF-2, MF-3) in
      [I-D.hao-idr-flowspec-nvo3],

      extended match filters carried in BGP attribute which includes
      time (MF-5) for enacting flow-specification filter rules
      ([I-D.li-idr-flowspec-rpd], [I-D.liang-idr-bgp-flowspec-time]).

   One filter that seems obvious is the filter for the MPLS labels.
   However, no proposal includes this Match filter for MPLS.

   The precedence order for the match filter rules was specified in
   [RFC5575] and expanded in [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn].  The
   combined precedence is shown in figure 4.

3.2.2.  Why Current Match precedence Logic a problem

   The current precedence logic requires the following:

   o  destination address (0/0 is fine for destination match,




Hares                   Expires September 6, 2016              [Page 15]

   o  components to go in numerical order,

   o  and the matches to be an "AND of all component matches.

   This does not allow matching MPLS before IP address, or MAC Addresses
   before IP addresses.  This may make some n-tuple filter policies more
   difficult or even impossible to express in this fasion.

3.3.  BGP Flow Specification Actions

   [RFC5575] also defines four actions which would be carried in BGP
   extended communities: traffic rate (in bytes), traffic action,
   redirect to IPv4 VPAN, and traffic marking.  Traffic action has two
   bits Terminal bit (T) and Sample (S) bit.  If the Terminal Bit is
   set, the the node apply all filter rules based as defined by "AND"
   and precedence.  If the terminal bit is clear, then the flow
   specification process is to stop.  The Sample bit implies that the
   flow specification enables sampling and logging for this event.

   Unfortunately, [RFC5575] was unclear about the "redirect to IP VPN
   action" and did not handle IPv6.  [RFC7674] was written to clarify
   [RFC5575] by clearly specifying the 3 extended communities that "IPv4
   VPN" needed to support AS 4 byte, and IPv4 address Routing
   Distinguishers (RDs).  [I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6] was written to
   extend this work to IPv6 filters, and to include the IPv6 flow in the
   filter set as figure 5 shows.

    Note: FA8 is really a filer plus an action:
     FA8-filter: Restrict processing for filters to set of interfaces
     FA8-Action: Forward only if: ACL + Flow-Specification filters
                 suggest forwarding.

3.3.2.  Why ordering is needed

   One the probems with adding the actions is that precedence has not
   been set for the actions, and some actions can conflict.  (see
   section

   [RFC5575] indicates that the actions specified in the document
   represent only the "subset of filtering actions that can be
   interpreted across the network".  As additional standardized actions
   occur, the non-standard action will need to have a precedence below
   the standardized actions.

   To allow better security for Flow Specification NLRIs, the BGP
   validation of prefixes using the Route Origination (ROAs) technology
   ([RFC6483]) should be placed as the first action for a prefix.  If
   the path needs to be validated The bgp-sec protocol
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol] can be used to validate the AS path
   and actions.  These validations must be first, and this is not
   allowed with the current actions.

   One the probems with adding the actions is that precedence has not
   been set for the actions, and some actions may conflict.  Table 6
   suggests an order with the fewest conflicts, but even there proposal
   will need to be updated to handle these conflicts.

   Conflict process may have an ordering of the conflict processes or
   parallel processes.  Due to this conflict processing also needs to
   have common diagrams or a language for precedence that is common
   across all rules.  An example of a conflict diagram is below.
   Conflict 1 and Conflict 2 are parallel conflict resolutions that are
   run prior to conflict 3.

4.  Proposal to Expand BGP Flow Specification Security

   [RFC5575] does not require BGP ROA [RFC6483] as the BGP ROA was not
   standardized until after [RFC5575].  [RFC5575] states "as long as
   traffic filtering rules are restricted to match the corresponding
   unicast routing paths for relevant prefixes, the security
   characteristics of this protocol are equivalent to existing security
   properties of BGP unicast properties", and "where this is not the
   case, this would open the door to further denial of service attack"
   (section 10).

   [RFC5575] requires an extension of the BGP route selection procedures
   [RFC4271] in section 9.1.2 in order to validate the BGP flow
   specification NLRI.  The BGP Flow Specification NLRI is valid if and
   only if:

   o  "the originator of the flow specification matches the orginator of
      the the best-match unicast route for the destination prefix
      embedded in the flow specification",

   o  "no more specific unicast routes" exist "when compared with the
      flow destination prefix", that have been received from a different
      neighboring AS than the best-match unicast route, which has been
      determined in step A".

   This set of validation requirements also require that BGP
   implementations are required to enforce the AS_PATH attribute having
   the neighbor AS in the left-most position.

4.1.  Validation for NLRI with L2VPN validation

   These validation steps required a unicast IPv4 or IPv6 route be
   transmitted with L2VPN ([I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn]) and the NV03
   flow specifications [I-D.hao-idr-flowspec-nvo3] to validate the path.
   These specifications do not provide additional details on any
   additional validation needed for the L2VPN or NV03 Case.

4.2.  Using ROA to validate BGP Flow Specification

   Since [RFC5575] BGP Route Origin validation [RFC6482] has been
   standardized, and the BGPSEC protocol [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol]
   has been developed.  This document proposes that an action be created
   in both the proposals that has precedence over all other actions.

   [I-D.eddy-idr-flowspec-exp] specifies cryptographic enhancements that
   include:

   o  creating a BGP identifier (in BGP attribute or in BGPSEC
      signature),

   o  Expanding BGPSEC coverage for Route Orgination Authorization (ROA)
      to cover the orignator of the BGP Flow specification for the BGP
      Flow specification SAFIs.

   o  Covering the BGP Extended Communities with BGP signature.

   While this work is interesting, the authors of
   [I-D.eddy-idr-flowspec-exp] consider it research into the use of BGP
   security.  Therefore, this proposal suggest this addition be covered
   as an expansion to the ROA process.  As this solitifies the ROA-
   action should be updated to include this functionality.

4.3.  Using BGPSec to validate AS Path

   The use of bgpsec protocol to validate the AS Path is orthongonal to
   the validation of the prefix to origin AS.  Therefore, local
   configuration can determine if the bgpsec protocol is supported and
   required to validate the AS Path checked for the set of peers using
   BGP Flow Specification.  If bgpsec is configured to be used, the BGP
   FLOW Specification SHOULD use the secured AS Path for its validation
   checks.

      action list and precedence of actions(section 5.4),

      conflict with other Packet-reception Event-MatchCondition-Action
      (ECA) policy (I2RS Filter-Based RIB and Policy-Based Routing
      (n-tuple forwarding)) (section 5.9),

      pros-cons of this approach (section 5.10)

   It is important to note that BGP Flow Specification is not the only
   packet reception ECA policy in a system.  BGP Flow specification is
   session ephemeral state which is not guaranteed to persist when the
   BGP peer session closes.  I2RS Filter-Based RIB is reboot ephemeral
   state which will not persist when the routing entity reboots.  Policy
   RIB (aka Filter Forwarding RIB) and ACLs are configuration state
   which can persist over the reboot of a system.  In many systems,
   operator-applied policy may set the priority between these systems.
   In order to provide interoperability between BGP Flow Specificastion
   and current IETF management systems using yang-models accessed by
   netconf, restconf, and I2RS protocols, it important to define the
   default precedence between these different packet reception ECA
   policies.  Section 5.9 provides the details on this proposals.

5.1.  Summary of Existing Flow Specification Formats

   The existing BGP Flow Specification is contained with the the BGP
   Flow Specification NLRI encoded using MP_REACH_NLRI and the
   MP_UNREACH_NLRI as defined in [RFC4760].  If the application does not
   require the next-hop field, it will be encoded as 0 length.  The BGP
   FLow Specification NLRI is encoded as shown in figure 11.  [RFC5575]
   specifies SAFI 133 for "dissemination of IPv4 flow specification",
   and SAFI 134 for "dissemination of VPNv4 Flow Specification".
   [I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6] expands the use of these SAFI to the IPv6
   AFI.  [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn] expands this use to L2VPN for the
   VPLS [RFC4761], EVPN and LDP-Based VPLS [RFC4762] with BGP auto-
   discovery [RFC6074].

5.2.  New Validation Rules for BGP Flow Specification: Precedence with
      ROA

   This precedence within BGP Session Ephemeral state depends on the
   preference associated with valid BGP Session flow specification NLRI
   received within a BGP State.  Since [RFC5575] was published,
   additional mechanisms to validate originating prefixes with an AS
   with Prefix Orgin Validation (ROA), and the BGPSEC Secure Path have
   been standardized.  The precedence of these mechanisms should be from
   BGP Security to ROA to [RFC5575].  The BGP peers determine that a BGP
   Flow specification is valid if and only if one of the following
   cases:

   o  If the BGP Flow Specification NLRI has a IPv4 or IPv6 address in
      destination address match filter and the following is true:

      *  A BGP ROA has been received to validate the originator, and

      *  the route is the best-match unicast route for the destination
         prefix embedded in the match filter; or

   o  If a BGP ROA has not been received that matches the IPv4 or IPv6
      destination address in the destination filter, the match filter
      must abide by the [RFC5575] validation rules of:

      *  The originator match of the flow specification matches the
         originator of the best-match unicast route for the destination
         prefix filter embedded in the flow specification", and

Internet-Draft        BNP Generic Policy/Filter IM            March 2016


      *  No more specific unicast routes exist when compared with the
         flow destination prefix that have been received from a
         different neighboring AS than the best-match unicast route,
         which has been determined in step A.

   The best match is defined to be the longest-match NLRI with the
   highest preference.

5.3.  Match Condition Filters with Precedence Ordering

   Match conditions depends on an "AND" of all rules within a Flow
   Specification policy.  A Flow specification policy is defined by a
   sequence of BGP Flow specification NLRIs with filter-match rules.
   The sequence of Flow Specification rules are terminate Traffic Action
   with a T-Bit flag set to zero.

   Match condition processing occurs in the following overall precedence
   ordered from IP protocol to

   1.  IP Protocol (1-13),

   2.  NV03-matches (MF-1 to MF-3),

   3.  Other overlay matches (spring, SFC)

   4.  L2VPN matches (14-24),

   5.  MPLS matches (MF-4),

   6.  L2VPN matches (currently 14-24),

   7.  interfaces matches (MF-5),

   8.  time matches (MF-6), and

   9.  Non-Standardized (First-Come-First Serve(FCFS)) match conditions
       (see [RFC5575] section 11)

   Editorial note: This list is longer than many, and will be discussed
   on the IDR mail list.

   Table 6 in figure 9 shows the filter by filter precedence order.  All
   flow specification filters combine as an "AND" of all filters.  A re-
   ordering of match filters is only possible in the the proposed
   version 2 of BGP Flow specification.

5.3.2.  FCFS Flow Specification Match Condition Filter Interaction

   [RFC5575] allowed for non-IETF standardized Flow Specification
   filters and extended community actions.  The beginning order of
   precedence for non-IETF standardized FCFS BGP Flow specification
   match filters is 65.  The network management yang modules SHOULD
   store the BGP Flow Specification match type byte for both IETF
   Standardized BGP Flow Specification Match Filters, FCFS BGP BGP Flow
   Specification Match filters.

5.4.  Flow Specification Actions and Action Precedence

   Some BGP Flow Specification actions can conflict with other BGP Flow
   specification Actions.  It will be the duty of each action
   specification to indicate how it interacts with the deafult
   precedence in Table 9 in figure 13 and the potential conflicts (shown
   in table 6 figure 9).

   Table 9 provides the default precedence for actions for the minimal
   subset.  All Standards actions have precedence overall FCFS actions
   incoded in BGP Extended Communities.

5.4.1.  FCFS Extended Communities with BGP Flow Specification Actions

   [RFC7153]allows for FCFS (First Come First Serve) allocation of BGP
   transitive types.  If an action is specified in the FCFS registry,
   the default precedence is after all standardized BGP Flow
   Specification actions(action 65+).  The BGP Flow Specification Yang
   models should store the Extended Community value for the FCFS based
   Flow Specification action.  If the precedence ordering has been
   changed by the FCFS, this should be stored in the configuration of
   BGP Flow Specification and in the operational state.

5.5.  Precedence with other packet ECA policies

   The BGP Flow Specification policy is currently handled as part of the
   route selection process within BGP.  Between BGP and other n-tuple
   packet ECA policies, the precedence policies is handled by the

   operator-applied policies (which often have operator default) which
   assign order and preference of filters within within an order.  The
   default assumption for BGP-FS is to assume the worst possible valid
   order if none is specified (e.g. 254 out of 255 ), and to assume the
   priority within that order as shown in table 10.  BGP Flow
   Specification (BGP-FS) Flow Specification for 128.2/16 destination
   port 20 may conflict with the following:

      a) I2RS Flow Specification for destination address 128.2/16 with
      destination port 12, and

      b) ACL filter for 128.2/16 destination address 128.2/16 with
      destination port 12.

   In summmary, the precedence is least dynamic in configuration to most
   dynamic received.  However, a BGP-FS action may signal a remote
   operator applied priority for a set of routes that allows the filters
   to combine certain filters (see table 11).

5.6.  pros and cons of Minimal subset BGP-FS Additions (Option 1)

   Pro - for Minimal subset (Option 1)

   Version 1's basic mechanism for BGP Flow Specification has been
   tested.  Additions can be added incrementally.

   Con - for Minimal Subset (Option 1)

   The current version 1 of the Flow Specification does not have
   ordering of packet ECA policy rules, flow specification filters, or
   flow specification actions other than the default precedence.
   Current implementations of BGP flow specification are finding this
   lack of ordering to cause operational difficulties.

6.2.  security addition of ROA

   The security for the ROA is required to be the first action (action
   order 1) for all actions.  All additional BGP Security precede all
   other security additions in the ordering.

6.3.  Match Filters and precedence

   The precedence of the match filters is determined by the order.  If
   two orders are the same, the precedence is dependent on the order
   specified in the table below.

6.3.2.  Precedence of filters among Routing Functions

   As discussed in the minimum sub-set (Option 1 for BGP-FS), there
   needs to be a precedence between n-tuple packet ECA policies.  This
   precedence is determined by policy rule order and a preference among
   policy rules with the same order.  Match Condition order is defined
   by the BGP-FS Filter order, and within the match the action order is
   defined by the BGP-FS.

   Precedence among policy rules from difference sources with the same
   order is commonly specified by operator-applied policies (which may
   be supplied by vendor defaults) where lower priority implies a better
   route.  For example, a BGP Flow Specification Policy rule can be set
   to a priority of 150 where an static ACL policy might be set to a
   priority of 40.  If the same two n-tuple packet ECA policies exist,
   then the lower priority rule within the the same order is selected to
   be active.

   The operator-applied policy can change these priorities globally or
   for a specific route.

   If any packet ECA related policy changes, then the BGP Flow
   specification must be re-evaluated per policy rule per order and
   priority.

6.3.3.  Precedence for re-ordering Match Policy

   Actions that change interact between levels of policy need to be
   defined in terms of policy actions in BGP Flow Specification.  For
   example [I-D.litkowski-idr-flowspec-interfaceset] provides a
   definition of the following combination of filter rules between ACLs
   and BGP flow Specifications:

   1.  Forward if both ACL forward and BGP Flow Specification Forward

   2.  Drop if either ACL drops or BGP Flow Specification drops.

6.4.  Actions and precedence of actions

   The actions allowed for BGP are listed in Table 12 provides the
   default precedence for actions for the minimal subset.  All Standards
   actions have precedence overall FCFS actions incoded in BGP Extended
   Communities.  The default order for these actions are listed below.
   All drafts defining actions must deal with the conflicts between
   actions and the ordering (see section 4).

6.5.  Pro-Con of BGP-FS-v2 (option 2}

   Pro - for version 2

   The current version 1 of the Flow Specification does not have
   ordering of packet ECA policy rules, flow specification filters, or
   flow specification actions other than the default precedence.
   Current implementations of BGP flow specification are finding this
   lack of ordering to cause operational difficulties.

   Con - for version 2

   Version 2 must be coded.  It can either be a BGP attribute with the
   policy rules (NLRI filters and actions) inside such as described in
   [I-D.li-idr-flowspec-rpd] or it can be a combination of a new BGP
   Flow Specification version 2 NLRI + Wide Community actions (with
   ordering).

   (Additional comments will be added here)

7.  Flow Specification Yang models

   The Flow Specification Yang models have configuration and operational
   state.  BGP Flow Specification (BGP-FS) configuration have local
   configuration for BGP-FS and locally configured BGP-FS policy rules.
   Operational state has three components:

   1.  Local node's BGP-FS Operational Configuration installed (if
       supported)

   2.  BGP Flow specification rules received from peers,

   3.  BGP Flow Specfication match statistics

   Comparison of the the BGP local configuration for BGP-FS policy rules
   with the BGP-FS policy rules, is aided by common yang definitions
   between these two functions.  Comparison of the BGP-FS Policy rules
   (locally configured or received) with I2RS Filter-Based RIB (FB-RIB),
   packet-ECA policy, ACL policy rules, and routing table policy rules
   requires is aided by common yang definitions between packet-ECA
   filtesr.

   This section compares BGP Flow Specification yang model in
   [I-D.wu-idr-flowspec-yang-cfg] and the I2RS FB-RIB data model is
   described in [I-D.hares-i2rs-fb-rib-data-model] which uses the packet
   reception ECA policy data model found in
   [I-D.hares-i2rs-pkt-eca-data-model].  A comparison of the policy
   structures is given in table 8, and the operation status model is
   given in table 9.  These models are similar.  It would be helpful to
   use a common yang definitions found in
   [I-D.hares-i2rs-pkt-eca-data-model].

   The packet reception ECA policy data model is also used to describe
   configured packet reception filter RIBs which (aka Policy Routing)
   described in (draft-hares-rtgwg-fb-rib-00.txt).

8.  IANA Considerations

   This section complies with [RFC7153]

   TBD.  There are a lot of assignments which will be filled in after
   the initial review of the technology.

9.  Security Considerations

   The new BGP Validation described in section 4.1 with the ROA improves
   on [RFC5575] security by improving the validation of the originating
   AS having permissions to send Flow specifcation for a prefix.  The
   validation of the path attributes and/or path requires the BGPSEC
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol].  [I-D.eddy-idr-flowspec-exp]
   contains suggestions on how to implement this with flow
   specification, but at this time the authors consider the technology

   described in [I-D.eddy-idr-flowspec-exp] so this draft does not
   suggest mandating it.  However, it encourages the develop of such
   work that pairs BGP Flow Specification with BGPSEC protocol.  When
   this work matures, this specification or BGP Flow Specification
   version 2 should implement it.
