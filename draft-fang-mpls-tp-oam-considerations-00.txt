Abstract

   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is
   based on a profile of the MPLS and pseudo wire (PW) procedures as
   specified in the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE), pseudo wire (PW)
   and multi-segment PW (MS-PW) architectures complemented with
   additional Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)
   procedures for fault, performance and protection-switching management
   for packet transport applications that do not rely on the presence of
   a control plane.

   This document is intended to explain the criticality of progressing
   the essential suite of MPLS-TP OAM solution elements in order to meet
   the urgent and increasing requirements for metro packet transport
   networks. It describes examples of key packet transport network
   applications for several operators, reviews associated MPLS-TP
   service provider requirements, and analyzes MPLS-TP OAM solution
   approaches that have been submitted to the IETF.  Based upon this, it
   is recommended that the solution elements described in draft-bhh-
   mpls-tp-oam-y1731 [6] be included within the MPLS-TP toolkit for
   supporting MPLS-TP OAM Functions, and that the draft be progressed as
   a Standards Track RFC.

1. Introduction

   This document is intended to explain the criticality of progressing
   the essential suite of MPLS-TP OAM solution elements in order to meet
   the urgent and increasing requirements for metro packet transport
   networks (e.g., mobile backhauling). It describes examples of key
   packet transport network applications for several operators, reviews
   associated MPLS-TP network operators' requirements (which is defined
   in RFC5654 [1]), and analyzes MPLS-TP OAM solution approaches that
   have been submitted to the IETF.  Based upon this, it is recommended
   that the solution elements described in draft-bhh-mpls-tp-oam-y1731
   [6] be included within the MPLS-TP toolkit for supporting MPLS-TP OAM
   Functions, and that the draft be progressed as a Standards Track RFC.

   This solution satisfies essential MPLS-TP OAM requirements as defined
   in RFC5860 [3], and has been tested and validated by several
   operators. While draft-bhh-mpls-tp-oam-y1731 [6] documents these
   solution elements within a single document, the solution approach
   allows operators to select the particular OAM functions they wish to
   use. Thus, it can complement other solution elements, as it does not
   deprecate existing MPLS and PW OAM mechanisms or preclude
   definition/utilization of other MPLS-TP OAM tools.

   The draft-bhh-mpls-tp-oam-y1731 [6] solution approach encapsulates
   Y.1731 [4] OAM PDUs within MPLS-TP packets in compliance with RFC
   5586 [2] and the draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework [5]. This approach
   leverages ITU-T Y.1731 [4] PDUs and procedures (state machines) and
   IETF RFC 5586 mechanisms to provide a set of MPLS-TP OAM mechanisms
   that satisfy RFC5860 requirements and fit within the MPLS-TP OAM
   framework as described in draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework [5].  This
   offers an excellent example of what could be considered a cooperative
   product of IETF and ITU-T, which builds upon the experience of both

3. PTN network Applications

      3.1. Summary of MPLS-TP based PTN Applications

   Current requirements of operators for supporting MPLS-TP based PTN
   applications are mainly driven by mobile backhauling and L2 VPN
   services for business customers.

   In typical network deployments, IP-based and transport-based
   environments are separated. IP backbone and metro core networks are

Internet-Draft Operator Considerations on MPLS-TP OAM Mechanisms   June
2010
   based on IP/MPLS routers, while metro aggregation and access networks
   are based on PTN equipments.  Of these, for several operators, the
   most urgent MPLS-TP application scenarios are for the PTN-based metro
   networks, which are separated in the existing networks from the core
   IP/MPLS networks. However, in the future, deployments of MPLS-TP
   within backbone/core networks are not precluded.

   The following section provides some examples of PTN applications in
   many operators' metro networks, to illustrate the urgent market
   requirement for MPLS-TP to be standardized in a reasonable way as
   soon as possible.

   Although the functionality of MPLS-TP OAM is more important than the
   message format of OAM, when operators began to widely deploy MPLS-TP
   technology, the network interworking between each vendor becomes a
   key concern. Usually, there are at least two vendor's equipments in
   one metro network. In order to provide end-to-end reliable services
   (such as L2 VPN) supporting OAM and protection, the requirement for
   standardized OAM PDU formats and procedures is urgent.

      3.2. China Mobile

   China Mobile has built 38315 PTN nodes in 138 metro networks in 2009.
   It is expected that the PTN deployment speeds up in 2010 with the
   roll out of 3G base stations.

   In a typical China Mobile metro network, there are several thousands
   PTN nodes to provide wireless backhauling, broadband (PON-OLT)
   backhauling, 10M/100M/GE private line services.

      3.3. China Telecom

   China Telecom has evaluated the application of PTN technologies for
   more than two years and concluded that Mobile backhaul and Ethernet
   Line service will be the main service drivers to deploy PTN. China
   Telecom regarded PTN technology to be mainly based on MPLS-TP.
   Further more it is necessary to build a PTN network that satisfies
   the rapidly growing mobile service (currently growing on the order of
   millions of customers per month) in wireless network.

      3.4. China Unicom

   China Unicom regards PTN technology as key for multi-service
   transport platforms. Currently, MSTP is still the preferred transport
   technology for China Unicom. However, from the long-term point of
   view, PTN technology will be important for transport platforms. So
   since 2009, China Unicom has been organizing a large scale of PTN
   testing to evaluate the maturity and feasibility of PTN equipments.

  3.5. Telecom Italia

   Telecom Italia investigated PTN technologies and has been testing
   several vendors' PTN equipment.  Telecom Italia has already planned
   to deploy a multi-vendor PTN network and therefore Telecom Italia is
   interested in a fast definition of MPLS-TP specifications in order to
   guarantee the interworking between different implementations,
   particularly in respect to OAM and protection mechanisms.

4. Requirement of MPLS-TP OAM function toolset

   From operator's view, the following OAM toolset and functionality are
   essential for MPLS-TP deployment:

   1. Pro-active Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification: to
      support protection switching and misconnection detection;

   2. Alarm and lock reporting: to suppress pro-active CC/CV alarm
      storms;

   3. Remote Defect Indication: to support bi-direction performance
      monitoring and single-ended fault management of bi-directional
      connections;

   4. Pro-active and on-demand packet loss/delay measurement: to be able
      to compare the PM on the same path provide by ETH OAM and MPLS-TP
      OAM. E.g. LM/DM should have the same behavior and results in both
      Ethernet and MPLS-TP;

   5. Client Failure Indication(CFI): to support services where alarm
      propagation capabilities are not available/supported by the client
      traffic (e.g., EPL services connecting two CEs not supporting
      Ethernet OAM);

   6. On-demand CV and diagnostic test: to allow service providers to
      localize fault (at least the Loop-back tool) and check the out-of-
      service test before service commissioning;

   7. Tandem connection monitoring(TCM) for any transport path (e.g.,
      LSPs and PWs) to support inter-domain monitoring;

   8. Route tracing: to support on-demand CV.

5. OAM solutions

   The operator's preference for a particular OAM solution depends on
   the application domain and their network evolution strategy.

   o  For the PTN application domain described in this draft, the
      priority is maximal synergy with transport-oriented operations and
      managerial practices. The solution based upon draft-bhh-mpls-tp-
      oam-y1731 [6] is consistent with this desired optimization.

   o  For some other operators who are evolving from an IP/MPLS
      environment, leveraging on IP-oriented mechanisms such as BFD and
      LSP-Ping is preferable (where possible to do so).

   Both operator viewpoints are valid and standards should be capable of
   providing interoperable solutions to meet the entire operator
   community needs.

   Different approaches have been submitted to the IETF standardization
   process and are summarized in the next sections.

  5.1. draft-bhh solution approach

   The draft-bhh-mpls-tp-oam-y1731 [6] solution approach encapsulates
   Y.1731 [4] OAM PDUs within MPLS-TP OAM packets in compliance with RFC
   5586 [2] and draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework [5]. This approach
   leverages ITU-T Y.1731 [4] PDUs and procedures (state machines) and
   IETF RFC 5586 [2] mechanisms to provide the essential set of OAM
   mechanisms that meet the MPLS-TP OAM requirements as defined in RFC
   5860 [3].

   ITU-T Recommendation Y.1731 [4] specifies:

   o  OAM PDUs and procedures that meet the transport networks
      requirements for OAM

   o  Encapsulation mechanisms to carry these OAM PDUs within Ethernet
      frames to provide Ethernet OAM capabilities in Ethernet networks

   The first release of ITU-T Rec. Y.1731 [4] was approved in May 2006.
   This Recommendation meets the operator's OAM requirements for
   supporting end-to-end Ethernet services, which represents the most
   popular and increasing market for operators and services providers.

   Although Y.1731 [4] is focused on Ethernet service OAM, the
   definition of OAM PDUs and procedures are technology independent and
   can also be used for other packet technologies (e.g., MPLS-TP)
   provided that the technology specific encapsulation is defined.

   The draft-bhh-mpls-tp-oam-y1731 [6] solution approach encapsulates
   Y.1731 [4] OAM PDUs within MPLS-TP packets in compliance with RFC
   5586 [2] and draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework [5] (i.e., the OAM PDUs
   are carried over the G-ACH [2]).

Internet-Draft Operator Considerations on MPLS-TP OAM Mechanisms   June
2010
   While draft-bhh-mpls-tp-oam-y1731 [6] documents these solution
   elements within a single document, the solution approach allows
   operators to select the particular OAM functions they wish to use.
   Thus, it can complement other solution elements, as it does not
   deprecate existing MPLS and PW OAM mechanisms or preclude
   definition/utilization of other MPLS-TP OAM tools.

  5.2. Extension of IP/MPLS OAM tools approach

   Another solution approach is to extend IP/MPLS OAM tools to meet the
   MPLS-TP OAM requirements as defined in RFC 5860 [3].

   Some work in this direction is ongoing in draft-ietf-mpls-tp-cc-cv-
   rdi [7] and draft-nitinb-mpls-tp-lsp-ping-extensions [9]. This
   approach is currently limited to support only the pro-active CC, CV,
   RDI and on-demand CV and tracerouting functions as defined in RFC
   5860 [3].

   So far a lot of technical difficulties have been encountered in
   meeting some important transport requirements and behaviours, while
   maintaining backward compatibility with existing BFD and LSP Ping
   implementations.

  5.3. Development of new OAM tools approach

   For other OAM functions described in RFC 5860 [3] and not covered by
   the extensions of existing IP/MPLS OAM tools (mentioned in section
   5.2), new tools would need to be developed.

   A series of separated drafts have been submitted with different
   maturity levels and there are some overlaps and inconsistencies that
   need to be resolved. These drafts appear to re-use some Y.1731 [4]
   information elements (e.g., draft-frost-mpls-tp-loss-delay [8]).

6. Interoperability of draft-bhh implementations

   As discussed earlier, interoperability testing of multi-vendor
   implementations continues to be conducted by various operators.

   Public interoperability events have also been conducted, as described
   below.

   In Sep. 2009 CEWC, EANTC conducted an MPLS-TP interoperability test
   and reported:

   "Different solutions have been proposed in individual author drafts
   such as draft-fulignoli-mpls-tp-bfd-cv-proactive-and-rdi [10] and
   draft-bhh-mpls-tp-oam-y1731 [6], however the working group has not

2010
   yet accepted these documents as IETF working group drafts.  The
   purpose of EANTC's effort is to evaluate the current status of the
   industry and to examine progress made since their last test in
   February.  The two OAM proposals tested have received substantial
   vendor and service provider backing, so EANTC were able to stage
   multi-vendor interoperability tests. The Alcatel-Lucent 1850 TSS-160,
   Alcatel-Lucent 1850 TSS-320, and Huawei PTN 3900 successfully tested
   an interoperable OAM solution based on the draft-bhh-mpls-tp-oam-
   y1731 [6] which proposes modifications to Ethernet OAM tools as
   defined in ITU-T Y.1731 [4] for use with MPLS-TP OAM.  The enhanced
   BFD protocol was used to check the continuity (liveliness) of the
   MPLS-TP LSP established between the Ericsson devices.  Both OAM
   solutions were verified for the use of GAL and G-ACh."

   The EANTC whitepaper can be getting at:

   2010/CEWC09/EANTC-CEWC2009-WhitePaper-v1_2.pdf (P.16~17).

   In Feb. 2010 MPLS &Ethernet WC, EANTC conducted another MPLS-TP
   interoperability test and reported:

   "EANTC tested the MPLS-TP OAM approach supported by Alcatel-Lucent,
   Huawei, and ZTE based on Y.1731 [4].  The Alcatel-Lucent 1850 TSS-
   320, Huawei PTN 3900, and ZTE ZXCTN 6100 all successfully tested
   interoperability for their MPLS-TP OAM implementations, based on ITU-
   T Y.1731 which defines a protocol for Ethernet OAM.  EANTC tested
   this by first verifying that the protocol was used by all vendors to
   establish connectivity on the respective MPLS-TP transport path, and
   their ability to switch over to a backup transport path upon loss of
   such connectivity. Between those devices was a LAN segment, to make
   sure that the trigger was the loss of CCM frames (not the LOS)."

   The EANTC whitepaper can be getting at:

   2010/MPLSEWC2010/EANTC-MPLSEWC2010-WhitePaper.pdf (P.13~14).

7. Considerations

   For PTN-based metro aggregation and access networks, the OAM
   mechanisms defined in draft-bhh-mpls-tp-oam-y1731 [6] fully satisfy
   all the essential MPLS-TP OAM requirements.

   The operators who have contributed to this draft fully support global
   standards, and have relied upon the work of ITU-T and IETF.  For this
   reason, full support was given to the JWT agreement reached between
   ITU-T and IETF, whose goal was to define the required MPLS-TP


Fang et al.            Expires December 7, 2010                [Page 9]

2010
   standard solutions by October 2009.  However, after waiting for over
   two years, the essential solutions are still not available, and based
   on the ongoing technical discussions there is great concern that a
   solution will not be available in time for the planned deployments.
   There is urgency for standard MPLS-TP solutions this year to support
   PTN applications, which are based on mature, multi-vendor
   interoperable and tested mechanisms and procedures.

   The maturity of OAM mechanisms is a key concern for operators. The
   OAM toolset defined in Y.1731 [4] has emerged as a high benchmark for
   OAM capabilities for support of managed end-to-end Ethernet services.
   Using the approach in draft-bhh-mpls-tp-oam-y1731 [6], which is based
   on proven ITU-T Y.1731 [4] OAM mechanisms and procedures, can help
   the industry in providing MPLS-TP technology in time to meet market
   needs. Also, for those operators who will have their PTN network
   managed and maintained by their transport staff, this approach offers
   the most expedient way to deploy MPLS-TP technology, as the
   mechanisms defined in draft-bhh-mpls-tp-oam-y1731 [6] are very
   similar to those of transport OAM.

   The roadmap for OAM toolset standardization based on re-use of IP
   tools and development of new tools does not meet the market needs of
   some operators like China Mobile, Telecom Italia, China Telecom and
   China Unicom, and therefore, for the sake of satisfying market needs,
   the solution described in draft-bhh-mpls-tp-oam-y1731 [6], which
   leverages existing ITU-T and IETF standards, should be taken into
   account.

   As discussed earlier, this proposal allows operators to select the
   particular OAM functions they wish to use, and can complement other
   MPLS-TP OAM solution elements currently under definition in the IETF.

8. Proposal

   This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at moving forward the
   progress of an essential MPLS-TP OAM solution set to meet the urgent
   and increasing requirements of PTN applications for the metro packet
   transport network. Therefore, it is recommended that the solution
   elements described in draft-bhh-mpls-tp-oam-y1731 [6] be included
   within the MPLS-TP toolkit for supporting MPLS-TP OAM Functions, and
   that the draft be progressed as a Standards Track RFC.

9. Security Considerations

   There are not any security considerations in this draft.
