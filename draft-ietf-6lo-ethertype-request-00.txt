     Assignment of an Ethertype for IPv6 with LoWPAN Encapsulation
                  draft-ietf-6lo-ethertype-request-00

Abstract

   When carried over layer 2 technologies such as Ethernet, IPv6
   datagrams using LoWPAN encapsulation as defined in RFC 4944 must be
   identified so the receiver can correctly interpret the encoded IPv6
   datagram.  This document requests the assignment of an Ethertype for
   that purpose.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

Internet-DraftEthertype for IPv6 with LoWPAN Encapsulation    April 2016


1.  Introduction

   The IETF has defined a format for IPv6 [RFC2460] datagram
   encapsulation [RFC4944] ("LoWPAN encapsulation").  This document
   regards any IPv6 datagram using the Dispatch octet as defined in
   section 5.1 of RFC 4944 to be using LoWPAN encapsulation.  LoWPAN
   encapsulation as defined in RFC 4944 has been updated by [RFC6282],
   and may be extended and modified by future IETF standards document.
   The intended layer 2 technology for IPv6 datagrams using LoWPAN
   encapsulation as originally defined is [IEEE.802.15.4_2011], which
   does not provide for a protocol switch in its layer 2 headers.

   There is interest in carrying IPv6 datatgrams over layer 2
   technologies that do include a protocol switch field:

   o  Usage of LoWPAN encapsulation in conjunction with IEEE 802.15.9
      Multiplexed Data Service [IEEE802159], which provides the ability
      to perform upper layer protocol dispatch for IEEE 802.15.4
      networks.  Wi-SUN Alliance intends to use the 15.9 Multiplexed
      Data Information Element to dispatch LoWPAN encapsulation frames
      to upper stack layers.  As specified in IEEE 802.15.9, dispatch of
      LoWPAN encapsulation frames will require an Ethertype be assigned
      for LoWPAN encapsulation.

   o  LoWPAN encapsulation will likely be needed for WiFi Alliance's
      HaLoW [HALOW] standard (low power operation in the 900 MHz band)

   o  Other layer 2 technologies such as Ethernet and debugging tools
      such as Wireshark require a unique protocol type field for LoWPAN
      encapsulation to properly interpret IPv6 datagrams that use LoWPAN
      encapsulation.

2.  Request to IEEE for assignment of an Ethertype

   When this document is published, the IETF will formally submit a
   request to IEEE for assignment of an Ethertype for IPv6 datagrams
   using LoWPAN encapsulation.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document is intended only to request assignment of an Ethertype
   for IPv6 datagrams using LoWPAN encapsulation.  It has no incremental
   implications for security beyond those in the relevant protocols.
