STATUS OF THIS MEMO

     with all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026. 

     Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
     Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that
     other groups may also distribute working documents as
     Internet-Drafts.

     Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
     months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other

ABSTRACT

This document defines a procedure to register RTP Payload Types
as audio or video MIME types. This is useful to identify the type of
an RTP transmission in a text-based format or protocol. It also
registers all RTP payload types defined in the document "RTP Profile 
for Audio and Video Conferences" (AVT profile) as MIME types. This is 
a rough draft.



1. Procedure For Registering MIME Types for RTP Payload Types

Registering an RTP payload type as MIME type follows the
same procedures as described in RFC2048.

In the registration template (see Section 2.8 of RFC2048), the fact 
that the type can be transferred via RTP should be noted under 
"Encoding considerations".

Depending on whether the type has already been registered for 
transfer with a non-RTP protocol (e.g. MIME mail or http) or not, 
several different cases can occur: 

a) Not yet registered as a MIME type

Example Registration Form:

----------

To: ietf-types@iana.org
Subject: Registration of MIME media type audio/XXX

MIME media type name: audio

MIME subtype name: XXX

Required parameters:

Optional parameters:

Encoding considerations:
This type can be transferred via RTP [RFCXXXX] only.

Security considerations: none

Interoperability considerations: none

Published specification: RFCYYYY

Applications which use this media type: foo-tools

Additional information: none

Person & email address to contact for further information:

Dr. Foo
foo-owner@foo.org

Intended usage: COMMON

Author/Change controller: Dr. Foo

-----------

b) MIME type exists for a non-RTP protocol

The encoding considerations of the existing type should be changed
to indicate that the type can also be transferred via RTP.

RTP-specific parameters can be added, and it must be clearly
stated that these are only to be used when the media type
is tranmitted via RTP transport.

c) Update an existing MIME type for RTP to be used for
a non-RTP protocol

The encoding considerations of the existing type should be changed
to indicate that the type can also be transferred via a non-RTP
protocol (e.g. SMTP, HTTP).

Non-RTP-specific parameters can be added, and it must be clearly
stated that these are only to be used when the media type
is tranmitted via a non-RTP transport.

2. Registrations for "Audio/Video Profile"

In the following sections, all RTP payload types described in
draft-ietf-profile-new-04.txt are registered as MIME types.

The following fields of the registration template in RFC2048
have generic values for all of these registrations:

Person & email address to contact for further information:
See Section describing the respective type in
draft-ietf-profile-new-04.txt. If no e-mail address is given,
contact the author of draft-ietf-profile-new-04.txt

Author/Change controller:
See Section describing the respective type in
draft-ietf-profile-new-04.txt

2.1 Audio Type Registrations

Table X contains information for registering the RTP audio 
payload types defined in draft-ietf-profile-new-04.txt as 
MIME types.

The MIME media type name of all types defined in this table
is "audio".

The first column gives the name of the encoding used in
draft-ietf-profile-new-04.txt.

The second column gives the name of the MIME subtype.

The third column specifies whether the type has an
optional (O, constant value in AVT profile) or mandatory (M, variable
value in AVT profile) "samplingrate" parameter or
not (-, N/A in AVT profile). 

The "sampling-rate" parameter is defined as for the "sampling
rate" column in Table 1 in draft-ietf-profile-new-04.txt.
It has an integer value.

Example: sampling-rate=8000

The forth column specifies whether the type has an
optional (O, constant value in AVT profile) "ms-per-frame" parameter or
not (-, no value in AVT profile). 

The "ms-per-frame" parameter is defined as for the "ms/frame" 
column in Table 1 in draft-ietf-profile-new-04.txt.
It has an integer value.

Example: ms-per-frame=30

The fifth column specifies whether the type has an
optional (O, constant value in AVT profile) or mandatory (M, no value in
AVT profile) "ms-per-frame" parameter.

The "default-ms-per-packet" parameter is defined as for the "default 
ms/packet" column in Table 1 in draft-ietf-profile-new-04.txt.
It has an integer value.

Example: default-ms-per-packet=30

@@ Section 1 should lay down general rules on when to register 
sampling-rate, ms-per-frame and default-ms-per-packet with an 
RTP audio type.
