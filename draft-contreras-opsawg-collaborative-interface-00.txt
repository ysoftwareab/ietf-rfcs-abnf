       Collaborative Interface between Network Operators and CDNs
           draft-contreras-opsawg-collaborative-interface-00

Abstract

   The absence of appropriate mechanisms for information exchange
   between Network Operators and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and
   content providers leads to avoidable inefficiency for the delivery of
   contents to end users in situations like congestion, selection of
   best distributed delivery end point, etc.

   This document describes the need of an information exchange interface
   between Network Operators and CDNs to collaborate in order to provide
   the best service quality to the end users.

1.  Introduction

   The lack of mechanisms for exchange of information between Network
   Operators and CDNs prevents from having optimal delivery of content
   to end users.

   For instance, CDNs typically select the delivery end point for a
   given user based on the internal status (e.g., workload) of the end
   points and possibly some inferred geographical information from the
   IP address of the end user.  In contrast to this, in case of having a
   mechanism for inform the CDN about the truly specific location of the
   end user or the status of the network links connecting the delivery
   point with the end user in terms of congestion, the selection of the
   end point, the content codification, etc, could be improved to the
   extent of taking optimal decisions according to the real status of
   the network.

   Then it seems valuable to define an interface that can assist on the
   decisions for both the Network Operators and the CDNs in order to
   serve the contents in the best possible way to the end user.

   This document propose the specification of such an information
   exchange interface between Network Operators and CDNs.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Collaborative interface scope

   The intended interface should enable an appropriate network
   management to handle constantly increasing traffic growth.  It is
   expected that such kind of interface could create both technical and
   cost efficiencies for both CDNs and network operators.

   The capabilities enabled by this collaborative interface are
   worthwhile for both Network Operators and CDNs.

   o  For Network Operators: ability to access content metadata in order
      to optimize quality in network, offer better user experience, etc.

   o  For CDNs: ability to access users' data in order to optimize end
      point selection, content format, etc.

   To reach that goal, the following sections describe in detail
   information that SHOULD be supported by the collaborative interface.

3.1.  QoS / QoE information

   The motivation for exchanging this type of information is to
   facilitate the provision of differentiated QoS / QoE for a given
   content or end user.  The expected benefits are the improvements on
   performance and QoE perceived by the end user.

3.2.  Topology notification

   The motivation for exchanging this type of information is to provide
   topological information of the network to the CDN and topological
   information of the caches to the Network Operator.  The expected
   benefits are the enabling of traffic engineering in the network, and
   the potential implementation of network planning in real time, e.g.,
   in case of a massive event.

3.3.  Congestion notification

   The motivation for exchanging this type of information is to provide
   link occupancy information that could impact on the delivery of
   contents.  The expected benefits are the assistance on content
   delivery decisions with network-aware information, and the
   improvement on performance and QoE perceived by the end user.

3.4.  Optimization capabilities

   The motivation for exchanging this type of information is to enable
   optimization mechanisms for traffic delivery.  The expected benefits
