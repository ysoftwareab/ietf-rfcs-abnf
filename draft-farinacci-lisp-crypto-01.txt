1.  Introduction

   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol [RFC6830] defines a set of
   functions for routers to exchange information used to map from non-
   routable Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) to routable Routing Locators
   (RLOCs).  LISP ITRs and PITRs encapsulate packets to ETRs and RTRs.
   Packets that arrive at the ITR or PITR are typically not modified.
   Which means no protection or privacy of the data is added.  If the
   source host encrypts the data stream then the encapsulated packets
   can be encrypted but would be redundant.  However, when plaintext
   packets are sent by hosts, this design can encrypt the user payload
   to maintain privacy on the path between the encapsulator (the ITR or
   PITR) to a decapsulator (ETR or RTR).

   This draft has the following requirements for the solution space:

   o  Do not require a separate Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that is
      out of scope of the LISP control-plane architecture.

   o  The budget for key exchange MUST be one round-trip time.  That is,
      only a two packet exchange can occur.

   o  Use symmetric keying so faster cryptography can be performed in
      the LISP data plane.

   o  Avoid a third-party trust anchor if possible.

   o  Provide for rekeying when secret keys are compromised.

   o  At this time, encapsulated packet authentication is not a strong
      requirement.

2.  Overview

   The approach proposed in this draft is to not rely on the LISP
   mapping system to store security keys.  This will provide for a
   simpler and more secure mechanism.  Secret shared keys will be
   negotiated between the ITR and the ETR in Map-Request and Map-Reply
   messages.  Therefore, when an ITR needs to obtain the RLOC of an ETR,
   it will get security material to compute a shared secret with the
   ETR.

   The ITR can compute 3 shared-secrets per ETR the ITR is encapsulating
   to.  And when the ITR encrypts a packet before encapsulation, it will
   identify the key it used for the crypto calculation so the ETR knows
   which key to use for decrypting the packet after decapsulation.  By
   using key-ids in the LISP header, we can also get rekeying
   functionality.

3.  Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

   LISP will use a Diffie-Hellman [RFC2631] key exchange sequence and
   computation for computing a shared secret.  The Diffie-Hellman
   parameters will be passed in Map-Request and Map-Reply messages.

   Here is a brief description how Diff-Hellman works:

   +----------------------------+---------+----------------------------+
   |              ITR           |         |           ETR              |
   +------+--------+------------+---------+------------+---------------+
   |Secret| Public | Calculates |  Sends  | Calculates | Public |Secret|
   +------|--------|------------|---------|------------|--------|------+
   |  i   |  p,g   |            | p,g --> |            |        |  e   |
   +------|--------|------------|---------|------------|--------|------+
   |  i   | p,g,I  |g^i mod p=I |  I -->  |            | p,g,I  |  e   |
   +------|--------|------------|---------|------------|--------|------+
   |  i   | p,g,I  |            |  <-- E  |g^e mod p=E |  p,g   |  e   |
   +------|--------|------------|---------|------------|--------|------+
   | i,s  |p,g,I,E |E^i mod p=s |         |I^e mod p=s |p,g,I,E | e,s  |
   +------|--------|------------|---------|------------|--------|------+

        Public-key exchange for computing a shared private key [DH]

   Diffie-Hellman parameters 'p' and 'g' must be the same values used by
   the ITR and ETR.  The ITR computes public-key 'I' and transmits 'I'



Farinacci               Expires January 21, 2015                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       LISP Data-Plane Confidentiality           July 2014


   in a Map-Request packet.  When the ETR receives the Map-Request, it
   uses parameters 'p' and 'g' to compute the ETR's public key 'E'.  The
   ETR transmits 'E' in a Map-Reply message.  At this point, the ETR has
   enough information to compute 's', the shared secret, by using 'I' as
   the base and the ETR's private key 'e' as the exponent.  When the ITR
   receives the Map-Reply, it uses the ETR's public-key 'E' with the
   ITR's private key 'i' to compute the same 's' shared secret the ETR
   computed.  The value 'p' is used as a modulus to create the width of
   the shared secret 's'.

4.  Encoding and Transmitting Key Material

   The Diffie-Hellman key material is transmitted in Map-Request and
   Map-Reply messages.  Diffie-Hellman parameters are encoded in the
   LISP Security Type LCAF [LCAF].

          Diffie-Hellman parameters encoded in Key Material field

   The 'Key Count' field encodes the number of {'Key-Length', 'Key-
   Material'} fields included in the encoded LCAF.  A maximum number of
   keys that can be encoded are 3 keys, each identified by key-id 1,
   followed by key-id 2, an finally key-id 3.

   The 'R' bit is not used for this use-case of the Security Type LCAF
   but is reserved for [LISP-DDT] security.

   The 'Key Algorithm' encodes the cryptographic algorithm used.  The
   following values are defined:

   AES:         2
   3DES:        3

   When the 'Key Algorithm' value is 1 (Group-ID), the 'Key Material'
   field is encoded as:

     0                   1                   2                   3

             Points to Key Material values from IANA Registry

   The Group-ID values are defined in [RFC2409] and [RFC3526] which
   describe the Diffie Hellman parameters used for key exchange.

   When the 'Key Algorithm' value is not 1 (Group-ID), the 'Key
   Material' field is encoded as:

     0                   1                   2                   3

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         Key Length describes the length of the Key Material field

   When an ITR or PITR sends a Map-Request, they will encode their own
   RLOC in Security Type LCAF format within the ITR-RLOCs field.  When a
   ETR or RTR sends a Map-Reply, they will encode their RLOCs in
   Security Type LCAF format within the RLOC-record field of each EID-
   record supplied.

   If an ITR or PITR sends a Map-Request with a Security Type LCAF
   included and the ETR or RTR does not want to have encapsulated
   traffic encrypted, they will return a Map-Reply with no RLOC records
   encoded with the Security Type LCAF.  This signals to the ITR or PITR

   that it should not encrypt traffic (it cannot encrypt traffic anyways
   since no ETR public-key was returned).

   Likewise, if an ITR or PITR wish to include multiple key-ids in the
   Map-Request but the ETR or RTR wish to use some but not all of the
   key-ids, they return a Map-Reply only for those key-ids they wish to
   use.

5.  Data-Plane Operation

   The LISP encapsulation header [RFC6830] requires changes to encode
   the key-id for the key being used for encryption.

        K-bits indicate when packet is encrypted and which key used

   When the KK bits are 00, the encapsulated packet is not encrypted.
   When the value of the KK bits is 1, 2, or 3, it encodes the key-id of
   the secret keys computed during the Diffie-Hellman Map-Request/Map-
   Reply exchange.

   When an ITR or PITR receives a packet to be encapsulated, they will
   first decide what key to use, encode the key-id into the LISP header,
   and use that key to encrypt all packet data that follows the LISP
   header.  Therefore, the outer header, UDP header, and LISP header
   travel as plaintext.

6.  Dynamic Rekeying

   Since multiple keys can be encoded in both control and data messages,
   an ITR can encapsulate and encrypt with a specific key while it is
   negotiating other keys with the same ETR.  Soon as an ETR or RTR
   returns a Map-Reply, it should be prepared to decapsulate and decrypt
   using the new keys computed with the new Diffie-Hellman parameters
   received in the Map-Request and returned in the Map-Reply.

Internet-Draft       LISP Data-Plane Confidentiality           July 2014


   RLOC-probing can be used to change keys by the ITR at any time.  And
   when an initial Map-Request is sent to populate the ITR's map-cache,
   the Map-Requests flows across the mapping system where a single ETR
   from the Map-Reply RLOC-set will respond.  If the ITR decides to use
   the other RLOCs in the RLOC-set, it MUST send a Map-Request directly
   to key negotiate with the ETR.  This process may be used to test
   reachability from an ITR to an ETR initially when a map-cache entry
   is added for the first time, so an ITR can get both reachability
   status and keys negotiated with one Map-Request/Map-Reply exchange.

   A rekeying event is defined to be when an ITR or PITR changes the p,
   g, or the public-key in a Map-Request.  The ETR or RTR compares the
   p, g, and public-key it last received from the ITR for the key-id,
   and if any value has changed, it computes a new public-key of its own
   with the new p and g values from the Map-Request and returns it in
   the Map-Reply.  Now a new shared secret is computed and can be used
   for the key-id for encryption by the ITR and decryption by the ETR.
   When the ITR or PITR starts this process of negotiating a new key, it
   must not use the corresponding key-id in encapsulated packets until
   it receives a Map-Reply from the ETR with the p and g values it
   expects (the values it sent in a Map-Request).

   Note when RLOC-probing continues to maintain RLOC reachability and
   rekeying is not desirable, the ITR or RTR can either not include the
   Security Type LCAF in the Map-Request or supply the same key material
   as it recieved from the last Map-Reply from the ETR or RTR.  This
   approach signals to the ETR or RTR that no rekeying event is
   requested.

7.  Future Work

   By using AES-GCM [RFC5116], or HMAC-CBC [AES-CBC], it has been
   suggested that encapsulated packet authentication (through encryption
   [RFC4106]) could be supported.  There is current work in progress to
   investigate these techniques for the LISP data-plane.  However, it
   will require encapsulation header changes to LISP.

   For performance considerations, Elliptic-Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH)
   can be used as specified in [RFC4492] to reduce CPU cycles required
   to compute shared secret keys.

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  SAAG Support

   The LISP working group will seek help from the SAAG working group for
   security advice.  The SAAG will be involved early in the design
   process so they have early input and review.

Internet-Draft       LISP Data-Plane Confidentiality           July 2014


8.2.  LISP-Crypto Security Threats

   Since ITRs and ETRs participate in key exchange over a public non-
   secure network, a man-in-the-middle (MITM) could circumvent the key
   exhange and compromise data-plane confidentiality.  This can happen
   when the MITM is acting as a Map-Replier, provides its own public key
   so the ITR and the MITM generate a shared secret key among each
   other.  If the MITM is in the data path between the ITR and ETR, it
   can use the shared secret key to decrypt traffic from the ITR.

   Since LISP can secure Map-Replies by the authentication process
   specified in [LISP-SEC], the ITR can detect when a MITM has signed a
   Map-Reply for an EID-prefix it is not authoritative for.  When an ITR
   determines the signature verification fails, it discards and does not
   reuse the key exchange parameters, avoids using the ETR for
   encapsulation, and issues a severe log message to the network
   adminstrator.  Optionally, the ITR can send RLOC-probes to the
   compromised RLOC to determine if can reach the authoriative ETR.  And
   when the ITR validates the signature of a Map-Reply, it can begin
   encrypting and encapsulating packets to the RLOC of ETR.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This draft requires the use of the registry that selects Diffie
   Hellman parameters.  Rather than convey the key exchange parameters
   directly in LISP control packets, a Group-ID from the registry will
   be used.  The Group-ID values are defined in [RFC2409] and [RFC3526].

Appendix B.  Document Change Log

B.1.  Changes to draft-farinacci-lisp-crypto-01.txt

   o  Posted July 2014.

   o  Add Group-ID to the encoding format of Key Material in a Security
      Type LCAF and modify the IANA Considerations so this draft can use
      key exchange parameters from the IANA registry.

   o  Indicate that the R-bit in the Security Type LCAF is not used by
      lisp-crypto.

   o  Add text to indicate that ETRs/RTRs can negotiate less number of
      keys from which the ITR/PITR sent in a Map-Request.

   o  Add text explaining how LISP-SEC solves the problem when a man-in-
      the-middle becomes part of the Map-Request/Map-Reply key exchange
      process.

   o  Add text indicating that when RLOC-probing is used for RLOC
      reachability purposes and rekeying is not desired, that the same
      key exchange parameters should be used so a reallocation of a
      pubic key does not happen at the ETR.

   o  Add text to indicate that ECDH can be used to reduce CPU
      requirements for computing shared secret-keys.

B.2.  Changes to draft-farinacci-lisp-crypto-00.txt

   o  Initial draft posted February 2014.
