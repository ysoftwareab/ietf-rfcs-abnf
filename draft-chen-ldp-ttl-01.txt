Abstract

   To facilitate the deployment of the TTL-based security mechanism for
   LDP, in this document we propose a new optional parameter for the LDP
   Hello Message that can be used by a LSR to indicate its support of
   the TTL-based mechanism.

1. Introduction

   The LDP [LDP] sessions established following the LDP basic discovery
   are between two directly connected LSRs. As a result, the TTL-based
   security mechanism described in [RFC3682] is fully applicable to such
   sessions.

   To deploy the TTL-based security mechanism, however, both LSRs
   involved in the LDP session must be coordinated and synchronized in
   setting and checking the TTL values. The coordination effort may not
   be trivial for a large network.

   To facilitate the deployment of the TTL-based security mechanism for
   LDP, in this document we propose a new optional parameter for the LDP
   Hello Message that can be used by a LSR to indicate its support of
   the TTL-based mechanism.


2. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3. Protocol Extension

   The new optional parameter for the LDP Hello Message is defined as
   the following:

       Optional Parameter: Support for TTL-based Security
                     Type: See the IANA Considerations section
                   Length: 0
                    U bit: 1
                    F bit: 0

   This optional parameter MAY be used by a LSR to indicate its support
   for the TTL-based security mechanism [RFC3682].  When both LSRs
   exchanging the LDP Hello Messages support the TTL-based security
   mechanism, the LSRs MUST follow the TTL-based security procedures for
   the LDP peer to be established between them. More specifically,

     o The TTL field of an outbound packet for the LDP session MUST
       be set to the maximum value (255).

     o For an inbound packet to be accepted, the TTL field of the
       packet MUST be 255 if the TTL value is not decremented by
       the receiving LSR. Otherwise, the TTL field MUST be 254. The

       choice between these two values is implementation specific,
       and is a local matter.

   The optional parameter SHOULD NOT be included in a LDP targeted Hello
   Message sent by a LSR, and SHOULD be ignored in a targeted Hello
   Message received by a LSR.


4. IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new optional parameter for the LDP Hello
   Message. The type code needs to be assigned by IANA.


5. Security Considerations

   This extension to LDP does not change the underlying security
   properties with the TTL-based security mechanism [RFC3682].  This
   extension is only application to LDP peers as a result of the LDP
   basic discovery. For LDP sessions resulting from the LDP targeted
   discovery, the TCP MD5 is recommended by [LDP].
