   document describes the experimental result of service differentiation

   using multihoming of multiple prefixes.  The multiple prefixes in
   IPv6 NEMO implements multiple virtual mobile network on a single
   physical NEMO.  Then, service differentiation can be achieved using
   several virtual mobile networks that exist on a single mobile
   network.  As a result, this configuration can be used for service
   differentiation for each mobile network node inside the mobile
   network by prioritizing among the virutal mobile networks or
   forwarding traffic from each virtual mobile network to different
   access networks.  In this experiment, a mobile router with multiple
   interfaces can make connection to several access networks
   simultaneoulsly.

1.  Introduction

   Various mobility support mechanism have been supposed, including
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] and NEMO basic support protocol [RFC3963].
   Usually the mobile devices, including a mobile terminal or a mobile
   router, are wireless, and easy to be multihomed with multiple
   interfaces.  For multihomed mobile devices, Multiple care-of address
   registration [MCoA] draft describes the way how to register multiple
   care-of addresses to the Home Agent in the case that a mobile node
   has multiple interfaces and uses them to connect several access
   network simultaneously.

   When multihomed, a mobile device can exploit the advantage of each
   access network, while [MCoA] does not have description about the way
   how to make a choice of interface, or access network, to transmit the
   traffic.  On the other way, there are eight configurations for a
   multihomed mobile device in [RFC4980], four of which are related to a
   scenario with multiple network prefixes.  In this draft, we consider
   a case of a single mobile router with a single home agent, while the
   mobile router has multiple interfaces and multiple network prefixes,
   which corresponds to (1,1,n) scenario in [RFC4980].  With multiple
   network prefixes, we can give beneifit of preference setting to the
   mobile router and the mobile network.  Our draft describes
   implementation of (1,1,n) configuration of [RFC4980] and its
   applicability.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Terms used in this draft are defined in [RFC5213], [RFC3963],
   [RFC3775], [MCoA].  In addition or in replacement of these, the
   following terms are defined or redefined:

   Mobile Network

      A mobile network is a network which is composed of a router and
      its subnet nodes, while the router has mobility.

   Mobile Network Node

      A mobile network node is a node connected to the mobile router.  A
      mobile network node is provided with Internet connectivity from a
      mobile router, so even a mobile network moves, a mobile network
      node that is attached to the mobile router is not aware of the

      movement.  A mobile network node can be mobile itself, or fixed
      with the mobile router.

   Virtual Mobile Network

      A virtual mobile network is a logical network that lies on a
      single physical mobile network.  Several virtual mobile network
      can be exist on a single physical mobile network.  Every virtual
      mobile network includes the mobile router and all or some of the
      mobile network nodes.


3.  Virtualization on a mobile network

   Virtualization is a term that refers to a technique for abstraction
   of physical resource to provide it to one or more users.  One single
   resource can be seen as several virtual resources to multiple users,
   or several physical resources can be seen as a single virtual
   resource to a user.  For a network, various types of virtualization
   can be exist according to the layer that is virtualized.
   Virtualization at lower layer, PHY or MAC, is implemented using
   various multiplexing or multiple access mechanisms to support
   multiple users that shares a single resource, like a link or radio
   spectrum.  But usually lower layer multiplexing technique needs MAC-
   level or PHY-level modification, and it is hard to implement or
   manage.

   As opposed to the lower layers, virtualization at network layer or
   higher layer can be easily adapted.  In this document we consider
   virtualization at the network layer.  Under IPv6, a virtual mobile
   can be implemented by using multiple mobile network prefixes in a
   single NEMO.  In this way, a part of mobile network, including mobile
   router itself and some of the mobile network nodes, forms a virtual
   mobile network while the mobile router and other mobile network nodes
   compose another virtual mobile network on the same NEMO.  An analysis
   about scenarios for NEMO with multiple mobile network prefixes is
   described in [RFC4980].  According to [RFC4980], multiple mobile
   network prefixes configuration can give beneifit of preference
   setting to the mobile network nodes.

   Each virtual mobile network is distinguished by mobile network prefix
   that the virtual mobile network uses.  A mobile router sets up
   multiple mobile network prefixes for the virtual mobile networks.  A
   mobile network node selects one of the mobile network prefixes
   advertised by the mobile router.


4.  Differentiation Using Virtual Mobile Network

   Service differentiation for mobile network can be implemented with
   following scenarios of virtual mobile networking.

4.1.  Service Scenario for Single Access Network

   A mobile router generates several mobile network prefixes to form
   multiple virtual mobile networks.  Each virtual mobile network
   corrsponds to a priority class of each mobile network node.  The
   selection of a specific virtual mobile network among the virtual
   mobile networks for a mobile network node is negotiated when the
   mobile network node attahces to the mobile router.  When a mobile
   network node sends traffic to the Internet, the mobile router
   regulates the traffic according to the priority of the virtual mobile
   network in which the mobile network joined.

4.2.  Service Scenario for Multiple Access Network

   In the case that the mobile router has several interfaces that are
   connected to multiple access networks, characteristic of each access
   network can be used for service differentiation of virtual mobile
   networks.  A mobile router generates new mobile network prefix when
   it attaches to a new access network.  Each mobile network prefix

   forms a new virtual mobile network, while the mobile network prefix
   also connected to a specific access network.  The mapping information
   between the mobile network prefix and the access network is stored in
   the mobile router.

   When a mobile network node joins to the mobile network, it notifies
   its requirement for an access network to the mobile router.  The
   requirement can be traffic classification, like BE, Voice, or Video,
   or the network requirement can be specified by some parameters like
   bandwidth, packet loss rate, or latency.  According to the
   requirement, the mobile network selects an appropriate virtual mobile
   network, i.e. the mobile network prefix, that is connected to one of
   the access networks.  With the selected mobile network prefix, the
   mobile network node can configure its network address, and joins to
   the virtual mobile network.  Traffic from the mobile network node
   destined to the Internet is classified at the mobile router and
   forwarded to the access network connected to the virtual mobile
   network prefix.


5.  Security Considerations

   We do not consider any security issues in this draft.
