Internet-Draft               extenting  M3UA                   July 2008


Abstract

   RFC 4666 defines M3UA a protocol for supporting the transport of any
   SS7 MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using
   the services of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol.  M3UA is
   designed for SEP-(TDM)-SG-(IP)-IPSEP and IPSEP-(IP)-IPSEP
   applications, so the network level management function isn't
   required.  But when M3UA is used in IP based signaling network, the
   network level management function needs to be extended.  This
   document provides the proposals for extending M3UA signalling network
   route management.  This document is consistent with RFC4666 in other
   sides.

1.  The Overview of IP based signalling network

   I The world trend of IP bearer for signalling makes SIGTRAN standard
   widely used in signalling network, and also makes IP based signalling
   network possible.

   An IP based SS7 signalling network using M3UA/SCTP/IP as transport
   layer has been defined by 3GPP, SEPs such as HLR, MSC can communicate
   with each other directly by accessing to this IP based signalling
   network.

   When deploying a large scale signalling network based on IP, it is
   better to separate the network into several sections, keep the number
   of SEPs in each section in an appropriate degree.  IPSTPs are needed
   between different sections to simplify the GT data and converge the
   SCTP association data.  And it is recommended that M3UA should be
   used on the IPSTP-IPSEP interface, while M2PA may be used on the
   IPSTP- IPSTP interface.

   The architecture of IP based signalling network is as follows:

       Figure 1: The architecture of IP based SS7 signalling network

   As same as the traditional TDM based SS7 signalling network, an IP
   based SS7 signalling network also provides signalling network
   management functions, such as signalling traffic management,
   signalling link management and signalling route management, to insure

   SCTP association to the IPSTP.

3.  The requirement of extending M3UA signalling network route
    management

   For a large scale signalling network based on IP with IPSTPs, the
   usage of M2PA on IPSTP-IPSTP interface can help to realize the
   signalling network management between different sections of the
   signalling network.  But M3UA can not fulfil the signalling network
   management within a section completely at present, the extension of
   it for this application is needed.  The reason for the extension will
   be discussed in this section.

   Within a section of a large scale signalling network based on IP with
   IPSTPs, the normal signalling transport route between two IPSEPs will
   transit an IPSTP.  When the destination IPSEP is not
   available(Scenario 1) , the IPSTP must notify the source IPSEP to
   choose another route.  And when the user part of the destination
   IPSEP is not available (Scenario 2), the IPSTP must also notify the
   source IPSEP to stop the signalling traffic.

   Scenario 1: the destination SP is not available

   In Scenario 1, when IPSTP1 finds the destination IPSEP (AS,IPSEP2) in
   IP domain is not available,and there is no connection between IPSTP1
   and IPSTP2,or the connection between IPSTP1 and IPSTP2 is not
   available.  It is a matter of RFC4666 interpretation whether IPSTP1
   sends a DUNA message or not to IPSEP1 upon failure of signaling
   connection towards IPSEP2.RFC4666 does not prohibit this, but it
   seems there is a bit of unclarity on whether SSNM Message can be sent
   by the IPSTP in the context of a AS->SG->AS interworking, while it is
   very clear that IPSTP can send such message in the context of SEP ->
   SG -> AS.

   In result, the source IPSEP (AS,IPSEP1) doesn't know the route is
   unavailable and still sends traffic to IPSTP1, which makes the
   signalling transport failure.

       Figure 6: Scenario 1 - the destination IPSEP is not available

   Scenario 2: the user part of the destination SP is not available

   In Scenario 2, when the user part of the destination IPSEP(AS,IPEP2 )
   is not available, M3UA doesn't define the destination SP(AS,IPSEP2)'s
   M3UA layer can send proper SSNM message (DUPU) to notify the source
   IPSEP (AS, IPSEP1),and doesn't define IPSTP's M3UA layer can transfer
   the DUPU to the proper IPSEP(AS,IPSEP1) either.  In addition ,DUPU
   contains no DPC field to indicate the address of the source
   IPSEP(AS,IPSEP1) which is the originator of the message( DATA) that
   triggered the DUPU.  In result, the source IPSEP (AS,IPSEP1) doesn't
   know the user part of IPSEP2 is unavailable and still sends traffic
   to IPSEP2 , which makes the signalling transport failure.

4.  The proposal of extending M3UA signalling network route management

   In IP based SS7 signalling network, referring to the availability, a
   signalling route can be in five states for signalling traffic having
   the concerned destination; these are Destination uavailable,
   Destination available , Destination congested, Destination user part
   unavailable , Destination user part available.

   M3UA shall realize signalling network route management via the IPSTPs
   and IPSEPs sending the concerned messages.  This document focuses on
   the route management about Destination uavailable/available and
   Destination user part unavailable/available.

4.1.  The route management about Destination uavailable/available

   Because of the unavailability of the signalling route to an adjacent
   destination IPSEP, IPSTP shall report it to other adjacent IPSEPs by
   sending M3UA DUNA message, to other adjacent IPSTP/SEP/STPs through
   MTP3 TFP message.  For IPSEP, when receiving a DUNA message, M3UA
   layer shall report to its user part the unavailability of the
   signaling route to the concerned destination IPSEP.  For IPSTP/STP/
   SEP, when receiving a TFP message, it shall handling the message
   according to Q.704.

   Because of the restored availability of the signalling route to an
   adjacent destination IPSEP, IPSTP shall report it to other adjacent
   IPSEPs by sending M3UA DAVA message, to other adjacent IPSTP/SEP/STPs
   through MTP3 TFA message.  For IPSEP, when receiving a DAVA message,
   M3UA layer shall report to its user part the availability of the
   signaling route to the concerned destination IPSEP.  For IPSTP/STP/
   SEP, when receiving a TFA message, it shall handling the message
   according to Q.704.

4.2.  The route management about Destination user part unavailable/
      available

4.2.1.  The route management description

   When IPSEP receives a M3UA layer DATA message, and finds that it
   could not be sent to appointed upper layer user, IPSEP shall send
   DUPU to the source point to indicate the reason: Unknown, Unequipped
   Remote User or Inaccessible Remote user.

   When IPSTP receives a M3UA DUPU message which contains: 1) The
   destination set to IPSTP itself. 2) The user part set to SCCP.  M3UA
   layer shall report to its user part SCCP the unavailability of the
   concerned IPSEP's user part.

Internet-Draft               extenting  M3UA                   July 2008


   When IPSTP receives a M3UA DUPU message which contains: 1) The
   destination set to another PC .  IPSTP may deliver it to the
   destination IPSEP directly, change the DUPU into a proper MTP3 UPU
   message and transfer it to the next signaling point(an IPSTP/STP),or
   change the DUPU into a proper MTP3 UPU message and transfer it to the
   destination SEP directly ,according to the route to the destination
   IPSEP/SEP.

   When IPSEP receives a M3UA DUPU message, M3UA layer shall report to
   its user part the unavailability of the concerned IPSEP's user part.
   For IPSTP/STP/SEP, when receiving a UPU message, it shall handling
   the message according to Q.704.  Because of the restoration of
   Destination User Part, the concerned destination IPSEP will send M3UA
   DATA messages, which can indicate its user part restoration to the
   related IPSEPs/IPSTPs/STPs/SEPs.

4.2.2.  The extension for DUPU massage

   The Destination User Part Unavailable (DUPU) message is extended as
   follows:

   A DUPU message is used by an SGP to inform concerned ASPs that a
   remote peer MTP3-User Part (e.g., ISUP or SCCP) at an SS7 node is
   unavailable.

   This message is also used by IPSEP to inform IPSEP/SEP/IPSTP that its
   corresponding user layer is unavailable.

   A new field 'Concerned Destination' is introduced to DUPU
   message,which indicates Destination PC of the DUPU.

   The field 'Concerned Destination' has been defined in RFC4666 for
   SCON message, tag is 0x0206.

   The DUPU message contains the following parameters:

   Network Appearance Optional Routing Context Conditional Affected
   Point Code Mandatory Concerned Destination Mandatory User/Cause
   Mandatory INFO String Optional

   The format for DUPU message parameters is as follows:

                       Figure 8: DUPU message format

   Concerned Destination: 32 bits

   The Concerned Destination parameter contains one Concerned
   Destination Point Code field, a three-octet parameter to allow for
   14-, 16-, and 24-bit binary formatted SS7 Point Codes.  A Concerned
   Point Code that is less than 24 bits is padded on the left to the 24-
   bit boundary.

   When IPSEP receives a M3UA layer DATA message, and finds that it
   could not be sent to appointed upper layer user, IPSEP will feedback
   DUPU to the source point with the reason: Unknown, Unequipped Remote
   User or Inaccessible Remote user.

   In DUPU message, the Affected PC field contains the PC of the IPSEP

   which sends this DUPU; the Concerned Destination field contains the
   source PC of the DATA message which triggers this DUPU.

   Concerned Destination field likes DPC field in MTP3 UPU message.
   Because DUPU is a M3UA SSNM message, which has no DPC field, IPSTP
   doesn't know the destination of this DUPU.  By extending DUPU, IPSTP
   can know the destination of this DUPU from Concerned Destination
   field.

4.3.  The Corresponding signalling node operation

   For IPSEP,

   - When receiving a M3UA layer DATA message, and M3UA laye finds that
   it could not be sent to appointed upper layer user, IPSEP shall send
   DUPU to the source point to indicate the reason: Unknown, Unequipped
   Remote User or Inaccessible Remote user.  In DUPU message, the
   Affected PC field contains the PC of the IPSEP which sends this DUPU;
   the Concerned Destination field contains the source PC of the DATA
   message which triggers this DUPU.

   - When receiving a M3UA DUPU message, M3UA layer shall report to its
   related user part the unavailability of the Affected PC's user
   part.M3UA related User layer will not send DATA messages to the
   Affected PC'S corresponding user layer again.

   When receiving a M3UA DUNA message, M3UA layer shall report to its
   user part the unavailability of the signaling route to the concerned
   destination IPSEP.

   When receiving a M3UA DAVA message, M3UA layer shall report to its
   user part the availability of the signaling route to the concerned
   destination IPSEP.

   For IPSTP,

   -When receiving a DUPU message,its M3UA layer analyzes Concerned
   Destination field, if it's own PC and user is SCCP, reports to SCCP
   layer that Affected PC's SCCP is unavailable.  So its SCCP will not
   send SCCP message to this Affected PC any more.  If it is not its own
   PC, the IPSTP transmits this DUPU to corresponding signaling
   point(i.e.  IPSEP or next jump IPSTP) according to the Concerned
   Destination in this DUPU and its routing table.

   -When receiving a M3UA layer DATA message, and M3UA laye finds that
   it could not be sent to SCCP layer, IPSTP shall send DUPU to the
   source point to indicate the reason: Unknown, Unequipped Remote User
   or Inaccessible Remote user.  In DUPU message, the Affected PC field

   contains the PC of itself; the Concerned Destination field contains
   the source PC of the DATA message which triggers this DUPU.

   -When adjacent IPSEP/SEP/STP/IPSTP availability status change, shall
   report it to IPSEP through DUNA/DAVA, to IPSTP/SEP/STP through TFP/
   TFA.

   -When receiving DUNA/DAVA/TFP/TFA, shall report it to IPSEP through
   DUNA/DAVA, to IPSTP/SEP/STP through TFP/TFA.
