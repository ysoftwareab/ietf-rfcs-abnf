       Upgrading Communication from Stub Resolvers to DoT or DoH
                       draft-pp-add-stub-upgrade-00

Abstract

   This document describes methods for a DNS stub resolver to upgrade
   its communications with a known recursive resolver to include
   encrytion using DoT or DoH.  This protocol is designed for the
   scenario where the stub resolver already has the IP address of the
   recursive resolver.

   Other protocols under develpment address scenarios where the stub
   resolver wants to discover recursive resolvers that use DoT or DoH.
   This document does not cover such discovery.

1.  Introduction

   A stub resolver (hereafter called "a stub") using traditional DNS
   over port 53 may wish to use encrypted communication with the
   recursive resolver (hereafter called "a resolver").  In such a
   scenario, the stub needs to know how to probe the resolver to find
   out if it can use encrypted communication.  This document describes a
   mechanism for a stub that knows the IP address of the resolver to do
   so.

   The mechanism in this document assumes that a stub wants to attempt
   to upgrade its communication with the resolver to either DNS-over-TLS
   (DoT, [RFC7858]) or DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH, [RFC8484]).  It can later be
   extended to other secure transports for stub-to-resolver
   communication transports.

1.1.  Definitions

   In the rest of this document, the term "resolver" without
   qualification means "recursive resolver" as defined in [RFC8499].
   Also, the term "stub" is used to mean "stub resolver".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP

   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Method Overview

   The pseudocode for the method is:

   # Things the stub resolver knows
   # dohCapable    Does the stub know how to do DoH
   # dotCapable    Does the stub know how to do DoT
   # resIP         IP address of resolver
   # upgradeNoAuth Does the stub want to upgrade even if it can't
                   authenticate the TLS session
   # insecureOK    Does the stub want to use unauthenticated classic
                   DNS if DoH/DoT upgrades fail

   if dohCapable:
       start TLS session on resIP:443
       if it succeeds
           if it authenticates correctly
               https://resIP/.well-known/resolver-info
               if 200-level response
                   use result to do DoH; finished
               else if 300-level response
                       follow redirect, act appropriately
               else if 400-level response
                       break
           else if upgradeNoAuth:
               https://resIP/.well-known/resolver-info
               if 200-level response
                   use result to do DoH; finished
               else if 300-level response
                   follow redirect, act appropriately
               else if 400-level response
                   break
           else
               break
       else
           break

Internet-Draft         Stub upgrade to DoT or DoH             April 2020


   if dotCapable:
       start TLS session on resIP:853
       if it succeeds
           if it authenticates correctly
               start doing DoT; finished
           else if upgradeNoAuth:
               start doing DoT; finished
           else
               break
       else
           break

   if insecureOK:
       Use unencrypted DNS on port 53
   else
       DNS transport setup failed

2.1.  Order of Desired Protocols

   The pseudocode in the previous section attempts to use DoH, DoT, and
   unencrypted DNS, in that order.  This is done to keep the pseudocode
   simple while demonstrating one possible order of transport selection.
   A stub implementation could attempt some or all of the available DNS
   transports in an implementation-specific or user-defined order.  For
   example, possible lists of transports to attempt might be:

   o  DoH, DoT, classic DNS

   o  DoT, DoH

   o  DoT, classic DNS

   o  Classic DNS

3.  Method Details

3.1.  Inputs to the process

   The method described here requires the following information.  It is
   listed with variable names from the pseudocode in Section 2.

   resIP  The IP address of resolver.  This can be either an IPv4 or
      IPv6 address.

   dohCapable  Set to true if the stub knows how to be a DoH client

   dohCapable  Set to true if the stub knows how to be a DoT client

Internet-Draft         Stub upgrade to DoT or DoH             April 2020


   upgradeNoAuth  Set to true the stub wants to use unauthenticated DoT
      or DoH if it is available.  Note that using unauthenticated DoT or
      DoH is inherently insecure because an on-path attacker can
      impersonate the resolver.

   insecureOK  Set to true if the stub wants to keep using classic
      (unencrypted) DNS on port 53 if the attempt to upgrade fails.
      Note that setting this to false will cause further DNS queries to
      fail if upgrade fails.

3.2.  Use of Resolver Information for DoH

   [pp-add-resinfo] describes how to use HTTPS to get information about
   a resolver.  In the protocol described in this document, the JSON
   returned from resolving the URI with the .well-known prefix MUST have
   a name/value pair with a name of "doh-uri-template".  The value for
   this name is the URI template for the DoH service, as described in
   [RFC8484].

3.3.  TLS Authentication

   In this mechanism, the stub has an IP address of the resolver.  It
   does not necessarily have a domain name associated with that IP
   address.

   In order to authenticate TLS sessions, the stub resolver must have a
   set of TLS trust anchors, such as those maintained by some operating
   systems.

   If the stub has a domain name associated with the resolver's IP
   address, and if the resolver uses that domain name in one of the
   subject identifiers in its certificate during the TLS exchange, the
   stub can use the domain name for authentication of the TLS session.

   The stub always has an IP address for the resolver.  If the resolver
   uses the same IP address used by the stub in one of the subject
   identifiers in its certificate during the TLS exchange, the stub can
   use the IP address for authentication of the TLS session.

   A resolver that uses this method to publish its information SHOULD,
   if possible, have a TLS certificate whose subject identifiers contain
   any of the IP addresses that stubs might be using for the resolver.
   At the time that this document is published, getting IP addresses in
   TLS certificates is possible, but there are only a few widely-trusted
   CAs that issue such certificates.  [RFC8738] describes a protocol
   that may cause IP address certificates to become more common.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document needs no IANA actions.

5.  Security Considerations

   The method described in this document explicitly allows a stub to
   perform DNS communications over traditional unencrypted,
   unauthenticated DNS on port 53.

   The method described in this document explicitly allows a stub to
   choose to allow unauthenticated TLS.  In this case, the resulting
   communication will be susceptible to obvious and well-understood
   attacks from an attacker in the path of the communications.
