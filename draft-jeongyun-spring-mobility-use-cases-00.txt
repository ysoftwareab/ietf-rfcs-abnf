                   SPRING Use cases for IP Flow Mobility
                draft-jeongyun-spring-mobility-use-cases-00


Abstract

   The ability for a node to specify a forwarding path, other than the
   normal shortest path, that a particular packet will traverse,
   benefits a number of network functions. Source-based routing
   mechanisms have previously been specified for network protocols, but
   have not seen widespread adoption. In this context, the term
   'source' means 'the point at which the explicit route is imposed'.

   The objective of this document is to illustrate some use cases that
   need to be taken into account by the Source Packet Routing in
   Networking (SPRING) architecture.

Internet-Draft  SPRING Use cases for IP Flow Mobility       August 2014


1. Introduction

   Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture leverages
   the source routing paradigm. An ingress node steers a packet through
   a controlled set of instructions, called segments, by prepending the
   packet with SPRING header. A segment can represent any instruction,
   topological or service-based. A segment can represent a local
   semantic on the SPRING node, or a global semantic within the SPRING
   domain. SPRING allows one to enforce a flow through any topological
   path and service chain while maintaining per-flow state only at the
   ingress node to the SPRING domain.

   The SPRING architecture is described in [I-D.filsfils-rtgwg-segment-
   routing]. The SPRING control plane is agnostic to the dataplane,
   thus it can be applied to both MPLS and IPv6. In case of MPLS the
   (list of) segment identifiers are carried in the MPLS label stack,
   while for the IPv6 dataplane, a new type of routing extension header
   is required.

   The scope of this document is to study the use cases for UEs with
   multiple interfaces which will simultaneously connect to 3GPP access
   and non-3GPP WLAN access. In this use cases, the forwarding paths
   can be explicitly specified by taking into account the Source Packet
   Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture.



1.1. Terminology and abbreviations

   Much of the terminology used in this document has been defined by
   the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which defines
   standards for mobile service provider networks. Although a few terms
   are defined here for convenience, further terms can be found in
   [RFC6459].

   AR   Aggregation Router

   CE   Customer Edge Router

   ER   Edge Router

   UE   User equipment like tablets or smartphones

2. Mobile network overview

   For simplicity we only describe IP flow mobility in the context of
   LTE (Long Term Evolution), which aims to provide seamless Internet
   Protocol (IP) connectivity between user equipment (UE) and the
   packet data network (PDN). But indeed IP flow mobility also applies
   to earlier generations of mobile networks, such as purely UMTS-based
   mobile networks. Wi-Fi

   An IP packet for a UE is encapsulated in an EPC-specific protocol
   and tunneled between the P-GW and the eNodeB for transmission to the
   UE. Different tunneling protocols are used across different
   interfaces. A 3GPP-specific tunneling protocol called the GPRS
   Tunneling Protocol (GTP) is used over the CN interfaces, S1 and
   S5/S8.

2.1. Building blocks of 3GPP mobile networks

   The major functional components of a LTE network are shown in Figure
   2 and include user equipment (UE) like smartphones or tablets, the
   LTE radio unit named enhanced NodeB (eNB), the serving gateway (S-
   GW) which together with the mobility management entity (MME) takes
   care of mobility and the packet gateway (P-GW), which finally
   terminates the actual mobile service. These elements are described
   in detail in [TS.23.401]. Other important components are the home
   subscriber system (HSS) and the policy and charging rule function
   (PCRF), which are described in [TS.23.203]. The P-GW interface
   towards the SGi-LAN is called the SGi-interface, which is described
   in [TS.29.061]. Finally, the SGi-LAN is the home of service function
   chains (SFC), which are not standardized by 3GPP.

   The radio-based IP traffic between the UE and the eNB is encrypted
   according 3GPP standards. Between the eNB, S-GW, and P-GW user plane
   IP packets are encapsulated in 3GPP-specific tunnels. In some mobile
   carrier networks the 3GPP specific tunnels between eNB and S-GW are
   even additionally IPSec-encrypted. More precisely, IPSec
   originates/terminates at the eNB and on the other side at an IPSec-
   GW often placed just in front of the S-GW. For more details see
   [TS.29.281], [TS.29.274] and [TS.33.210].

Mobile network consists of some LTE components in 3GPP access and GTP
connections between eNB and S-GW, and between S-GW and P-GW are
established, as shown in Figure 1. The LTE components are connected to
MPLS components such as AS, AR and ER in IP network. The interactions
between LTE components occur through MPLS components.

Mobile network consists of some LTE components in non-3GPP access
(WLAN) and GTP connections or IPsec between AP/APC and ePDG, and
between ePDG and P-GW are established, as shown in Figure 2. The WLAN
components are connected to MPLS components such as AS, AR and ER in IP
network. The interactions between WLAN components occur through MPLS
components.

3. Use case

   With an explosive increase of data traffic, cellular networks are
   likely to be operating at their capacity limits and hence. Data
   offload is regarded as one of solutions that can avoid overload and
   improve the overall end user experience by redirection.



3.1. High level use case

   This sub-clause describes a use case where the UE is connected to
   the EPS via different accesses simultaneously, sending and receiving
   different IP flows through different accesses.

   Michael is in an outdoor area and the 3GPP accesses are only
   available. Michael is accessing different services with different
   characteristics in terms of QoS requirements and bandwidth:

   - a Video Telephony call: IP Flow 1 and 5

   - a p2p download: IP Flow 2

   - a media file synchronization (e.g. a podcast and downloading of a
   TV series): IP Flow 3

   - a non-conversational video streaming (e.g. IPTV): IP Flow 4

   The scenario is depicted in Figure 3.

         Figure 3 Routing of different IP flows through 3GPP access



   After a while Michael comes back home where both 3GPP access and a
   trusted or untrusted non-3GPP access are available. As an example,
   the non-3GPP access may be a domestic WiFi hotspot. Some of these
   flows may be from the same application (e.g. the Video Telephony may
   be via a virtual private network tunnel).  Based on operator's
   policies, the user's preferences and the characteristics of the
   application and the accesses, the IP flows are routed differently;
   as an example, the audio media (conversational voice) of the VT call
   and the video streaming are routed via 3GPP access, while the video
   media (conversational video (live streaming)) of the VT, the p2p
   download (best effort) and media file synchronization are routed
   through the non-3GPP access. The scenario is depicted in Figure 4.

3.2. SPRING use case

   Devices with multiple wireless interfaces (e.g. 3GPP, WLAN, etc.)
   are becoming commonly available and the set of applications running
   in the mobile devices is diversifying with some applications suited
   to run over 3GPP access systems and other applications well suited
   to run over non-3GPP WLAN access systems. It is called IP flow
   mobility to allow a telecom operator to seamlessly and selectively
   switch over a single IP flow (e.g., user application) to a different
   radio access, while keeping all other ongoing connections for this
   and the rest of the users on both radio accesses untouched. However
   IP flow mobility (e.g., traffic redirection) always introduces some
   kind of delay, due to processing, forwarding, and the difference in
   round-trip time (RTT) between the different accesses.

   With segment routing, the paths between PEs that connect LTE
   components (e.g., eNB and S-GE, AP/APC and ePDG, S-GE and P-GW, and
   ePDG and P-GW) can be explicitly specified instead of RSVP or LDP.
   When data over 3GPP access are redirected to non-3GPP access, the
   path of data over non-3GPP access can be specified in the similar
   way of data over 3GPP access in order to reduce the redirection
   delay. When the PEs connecting the relevant LTE components is same,
   then the paths can be exactly same. Therefore redirection delay
   could be significantly reduced.
