              Clarifying the Historical Record for RFC 32
                       draft-flanagan-rfc32alt-00

Abstract

   This document identifies an issue found in the historical record of
   the RFC Series with regards to RFC 32, a number issued to two
   separate documents in the early days of the Series.  This document
   serves as a reference point such that errata can be registered
   against those RFCs that refer to RFC 32.

1.  Conflict Description and Resolution

   This document describes an issue found in the historical record as
   captured in the RFC Index [RFC-INDEX] of the RFC Series with regard
   to RFC 32: a number issued to two separate documents in the early
   days of the Series.  This document serves as a reference such that
   errata can be registered against those RFCs that refer to either
   document assigned the identifier RFC 32.

   The blog series "365 Days of RFCs" [DAYS-365] by Darius Kazemi
   included discovery of the fact that while the RFC Editor index
   referred to "Some Thoughts on SRI's Proposed Real Time Clock" by
   Jerry Cole as [RFC0032], other RFCs later in the series instead
   referred to "Connecting M.I.T.  Computers to the ARPA Computer-to-
   Computer Communication Network" by Dietrich Vedder via the same RFC
   identifier.  While there are theories around how this happened,
   absolute certainty regarding the cause of the duplicate identifier
   issuance is unlikely to be uncovered this many years after the fact.

   For the sake of clarifying the historical record, "Some Thoughts on
   SRI's Proposed Real Time Clock" will continue to be recorded as RFC
   32 in the index of RFCs managed by the RFC Editor.  The document
   "Connecting M.I.T.  Computers to the ARPA Computer-to-Computer
   Communication Network", is hosted (with permission from the author)
   on the RFC Editor website [NWG-RFC32].  All RFCs that refer to the
   either the Cole document or the Vedder document will have an errata
   issued in order to capture the discrepancy and point individuals to
   the correct document.
