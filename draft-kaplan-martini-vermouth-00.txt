Abstract

   The Martini Working Group is defining a mechanism for SIP IP-PBX 
   type devices to REGISTER and obtain SIP service for E.164-based 
   Address of Records, in [draft-gin].  Another draft [draft-olive] 
   proposes the same for non-E.164-based AoRs.  This document defines a 
   variant of the Registration Event-package [reg-event] for open-ended 
   AoRs for either mechanisms, using a wildcard syntax and specific 
   target handling rules.

1. Introduction 
    
   In many deployed SIP Service Provider (SSP) architectures, it is 
   common to use REGISTER requests to provide the reachability 
   information for IP-PBXs, instead of DNS-based resolution and 
   routing.  An IETF-defined mechanism for doing so is being worked on 
   in the Martini Working Group, in [draft-gin].  Another draft, 
   [draft-olive] uses the [draft-gin] Martini mechanism for non-E.164 
   AoRs as well.

   In both cases, the IP-PBX or other entity may wish to Subscribe to 
   the Registration Event Package based on [RFC3680] for the 
   Registration state information of the AoRs Registered by the [draft-
   gin] REGISTER transactions.  For example, the IP-PBX may wish to 
   learn about all of the AoRs which were implicitly Registered by 
   [draft-gin] or [draft-olive], or to learn about changes in their 
   provisioning. 
    
   In theory, the [draft-gin] mechanism is simply a short-hand single 
   REGISTER transaction for a bulk set of AoRs in lieu of multiple, 
   separate REGISTER transactions for each AoR.  In practice, however, 
   the E.164 user numbers may be an "open" numbering plan/range, such 
   that the SSP only really knows about a certain number of digits and 
   the rest are only known to the IP-PBX.  Likewise, when [draft-olive] 
   is used, the Local-Number may be only partially known to the SSP. 
    
   Therefore, it is not possible for the SSP to actually provide state 
   information for each possible unique AoR instance.  Instead, it 
   needs to provide an indication for the registration state of the 
   prefix or digit portion it does know about. 
    
   This document proposes to provide such information using an agreed 
   upon URI format: a "Bulk-AoR", which follows a specific AoR syntax 
   indicating the number range, and is formatted such that it can be 
   reasonably reserved for such use. 
    
   This document also defines the rules for targeting SUBSCRIBE 
   requests to reach specific resources for registration state 
   information. 
 
2. Definitions 
    
   For brevity's sake, this document uses the word "request" instead of 
   "out-of-dialog request", but in all case means out-of-dialog 
   request. 
 
   AoR: address-of-record, as defined by RFC 3261: a URI by which the 
   user is canonically known (e.g., on their business cards, in the 
   From header field of their requests, in the To header field of 
   REGISTER requests, etc.). 
    
   Bulk-AoR: a SIP or SIPS address-of-record with a "range" URI user 
   parameter which expands the user string based on a heuristic. 
    
   Local-Number: an AoR which follows the form of local-number in 
   [RFC3966], but may be encoded in a SIP or TEL URI.  The local-number 
   contains a 'phone-context' parameter identifying the scope of its 
   number.

Internet-Draft           SIP MARTINI VERMOUTH                 May 2010 
 
 
   Email-style URI: a SIP AoR which does not identify a global E.164 
   number or Local-Number. 
    
   Implicit Registration: implicitly providing the reachability 
   information for something other than the AoR explicitly indicated in 
   the Register transaction. 
    
   Reachability Information: a set of URI's identifying the host and 
   path of Proxies to reach that host; like any URI, these URI's may 
   identify the specific connection transport, IP Address, and port 
   information, or they may only identify FQDN's. 
    
   SSP: SIP Service Provider, as defined by [RFC5486]. 
    
3. The Solution - an Overview 
    
   To handle the open-numbering-plan problem, the concept proposed in 
   this document is to specify a specific URI syntax which is legal in 
   SIP ABNF grammar, but highly unlikely to exist for anything but this 
   document's purpose, by defining a new URI user parameter.  This 
   creates a "Bulk-AoR" URI, which is treated as any other AoR URI from 
   the perspective of [RFC3680]. 
    
   The specific Bulk-AoR format is similar but not identical to the 
   "Wildcarded" AoR syntax already in use in certain deployments.  The 
   Bulk-AoR format is "sip:<user>;range=<expansion>@<domain>", where 
   "<expansion>" is similar to a regular expression pattern but has a 
   very limited, specified syntax.  The limited syntax is used to avoid 
   ambiguities, make it compliant with [RFC3261] ABNF rules, and reduce 
   confusion - rationale for this is provided in Appendix A. [Open 
   issue: should a new URI parameter similar to "user=phone" be defined 
   for such an AoR type?] 
    
   Furthermore, this document assumes that the SSP's Registrar 
   processes Subscriptions for the "reg" event package following 
   [RFC3680], and thus that a SUBSCRIBE targeted to any of the 
   implicitly Registered AoRs be processed by the SSP (not the IP-PBX).  
   This document also provides a means, however, to Subscribe for the 
   registration state for those same AoRs in the IP-PBX itself, by 
   using the "bnc" parameter in the SUBSCRIBE target URI. 
    
   Lastly, this document specifies that the To-URI used for the [draft-
   gin] REGISTER request, be usable as the target for the SUBSCRIBE 
   request, for Subscribing to the registration event information for 
   all implicitly registered AoRs of the [draft-gin] mechanism, any or 
   all of which may be encoded using the Bulk-AoR syntax proposed in 
   this document.

   The Registration Event Packet behavior for this document's mechanism 
   works exactly the same way as defined in [RFC3680].  This document 
   does not update [RFC3680] or change its semantics.  The only 
   "changes" discussed in this document are (1) details of how to 
   target a SUBSCRIBE for specific Registration state information 
   resources in section 5, and (2) explanations about reginfo XML 
   documents with Bulk-AoRs in section 6.  Neither of these 
   substantively changes [RFC3680] behavior. 
    
4. The Bulk-AoR 
    
   A "Bulk-AoR" is a SIP or SIPS URI Address-of-record containing a new 
   URI user parameter named "range".  The range parameter expands the 
   user portion based on a specific heuristic, when the Bulk-AoR is 
   processed by a SIP node which follows this document.  When processed 
   by any other node, it is just another SIP or SIPS URI.   
    
   The primary use-case for a Bulk-AoR is for the "aor" attribute value 
   of a "registration" element of a [RFC3680] reginfo XML document, as 
   described in section 6.  Using the Bulk-AoR as a target for generic 
   SIP requests is outside the scope of this document.  Using it as the 
   target for a SUBSCRIBE request is discussed in section 5.4. 
    
4.1. Bulk-AoR ABNF Rules 
    
   A Bulk-AoR follows [RFC3261] ABNF rules as a specific form of the 
   'user' token field of a SIP or SIP URI userinfo portion in 
   [RFC3261]: 
   bulk-aor-user  = user ";range=" expansion 
   expansion      = exp-char-set exp-char-count  
    
   exp-char-set   = digit-char-set / any-char-set 
   digit-char-set = dsc-begin "-" dsc-end 
   dsc-begin      = DIGIT 
   dsc-end        = DIGIT 
   any-char-set   = "." 
    
   exp-char-count = "(" exp-min "," exp-max ")" 
   exp-min        = DIGIT 
   exp-max        = DIGIT 
    
   The "digit-char-set" defines a range of digit characters, for 
   example 0-9 or 3-5, inclusive.  The "dsc-begin" digit value must be 
   less than or equal to the "dsc-end" digit value. 
    
   The "any-char-set" defines any character allowed in the 'user' token 
   field of [RFC3261]. 
    

 
 
Kaplan                 Expires - November 2009               [Page 5] 
Internet-Draft           SIP MARTINI VERMOUTH                 May 2010 
 
 
   The "exp-char-count" defines a minimum and maximum number of times a 
   character within the exp-char-set may be repeated, inclusive.  The 
   "exp-min" digit value must be less than or equal to the "exp-max" 
   digit value. 
    
   An example SIP Bulk-AoR is "sip:1234;range=0-9(1,8)@ssp.example.com" 
   Note that the ABNF rules are written such that the digit-char-set 
   could be wrapped in a '[' and ']' characters, and the parenthesis in 
   exp-char-count could be converted to '{' and '}', and the resultant 
   would then be a regex pattern with the same semantics.  Furthermore, 
   although the syntax does not support '*' and '+' regex command 
   characters, they are logically equivalent to a {0,} and {1,} albeit 
   with some specified maximum bound. 
    
4.2. Restrictions of Use 
    
   The mechanism proposed in this document is based on [RFC3680], but 
   creates a specific URI syntax for indicating Registration event 
   information for bulk groups of AoRs.  In other words, it is 
   semantically equivalent to multiple, individual AoR state 
   information.  Since the URI used represents multiple AoRs, certain 
   implementation details are constricted beyond what [RFC3680] would 
   have required.   
    
   In particular, with separate AoR Registration state it is possible 
   to distribute the Subscription processing across multiple servers, 
   for different AoRs.  Such is not possible for the AoRs covered by a 
   Bulk-AoR range - the Registration state information, and the state 
   machine described in [RFC3680] MUST be the same and available to the 
   same SIP entity which processes the Subscription.   
    
   Furthermore, the Bulk-AoR syntax does not have an "exclude" semantic 
   - it is wholly inclusive, meaning that any specific AoR within its 
   range is included.  For example, if an AoR within the range has 
   multiple Contacts, but not all AoRs of the range have the same 
   multiple Contact values, then the Bulk-AoR state is in addition to 
   any separate AoR entries.  Once again, this requires the same SIP 
   entity which processes the Subscription to have such information 
   available to it for all of the AoRs included within the Bulk-AoR 
   range. 
    
    
5.   Subscribing for Registration State Resources 
    
   As per [RFC3680], when a UAC Subscribes to a SIP URI for the "reg" 
   Event Package, the entity responsible for the Registration state of 
   the SIP URI processes the SUBSCRIBE and returns a Registration 
   information document with the details of the URI's registration 
   state, including Registered Contacts and such.  The target of the

Internet-Draft           SIP MARTINI VERMOUTH                 May 2010 
 
 
   Registration event package Subscription (the Request URI used for 
   the SUBSCRIBE request) identifies the AoR for which the 
   "registration state" is requested.  In other words, although the 
   target of the SUSBCRIBE identifies a Registered AoR, it is not 
   routed to the Registered contacts of that AoR, but rather to the 
   entity responsible for the AoR's Registration state: the SSP. 
    
   In a [draft-gin] or [draft-olive] context, the bulk Registration 
   implicitly Registers multiple AoRs of the SSP.  As such, this 
   document proposes that [RFC3680] continue to be followed, and that a 
   SUBSCRIBE targeted to one of the implicitly Registered AoRs be 
   processed by the SSP and return the registration state information 
   *of that AoR* - namely, the expanded Contact, Path information, etc. 
   of the IP-PBX as the "User Agent".   
    
   In a [draft-gin] or [draft-olive] context, however, there is a need 
   to handle Subscriptions for other resources as well.  There is a 
   need to be able to Subscribe to the registration information of AoRs 
   within the IP-PBX (the IP-PBX's internal registration state); and to 
   be able to Subscribe for registration information of all implicitly 
   registered AoRs of the IP-PBX without knowing what they are in 
   advance.  This section defines how one Subscribes to such target 
   resources. 
    
5.1. Subscribing to AoRs 
    
   A SUBSCRIBE for any specific AoR URI, including any implicitly 
   Registered by [draft-gin], MUST be processed and handled as if there 
   had been an explicit REGISTER transaction and associated state for 
   that specific AoR.  In other words, assuming local policies allow 
   it, a SUBSCRIBE for "sip:+123456@ssp.example.com" would get the 
   Registration state for that AoR, with the *expanded* [draft-gin] 
   Contact URI, the remaining expires value from the 'bnc' REGISTER, 
   etc.  From a logical perspective, the [draft-gin] REGISTER was 
   simply a short-hand for multiple, separate REGISTERs. 
    
   Any internal optimization performed by the SSP location-service 
   database for handling Bulk-AoRs MUST NOT change this external 
   behavior.  In particular, although local policy MAY simply not 
   provide Registration status for the specific AoR, it MUST NOT 
   respond to such with the Bulk-AoR form of the Registration 
   information.  Doing so would lead to backwards-compatibility 
   problems, and is also not consistent with the resource targeted for 
   the SUBSCRIBE.  If a UAC is Subscribing for a specific AoR's event 
   information, that is what it should get, or nothing at all.

Internet-Draft           SIP MARTINI VERMOUTH                 May 2010 
 
 
5.2. Subscribing to state in the IP-PBX 
    
   To Subscribe to the registration state *within* the IP-PBX (i.e., 
   for the IP-PBX's User Agents), one could send a subsequent SUBSCRIBE 
   to the IP-PBX based on the information learned from the Subscription 
   to the SSP's AoRs.  For example, subscribing to 
   "sip:+1234567890@ssp.example.com" could return the expanded 
   Registered Contact "sip:+1234567890@192.1.2.3" and Path information 
   for that AoR; and sending another SUBSCRIBE with the target 
   "sip:+1234567890@192.1.2.3" and a Route set of the registered Path 
   information could reach the IP-PBX and retrieve registration 
   information for that resource. 
    
   To avoid such complexity, however, this document proposes that a 
   SUBSCRIBE targeted to a URI with a "bnc" URI parameter appended, be 
   usable to target the resource of the IP-PBX to begin with, and not 
   be processed for the event package by the SSP.  In other words, 
   given the example above, if the SUBSCRIBE were targeted to 
   "sip:+1234567890@ssp.example.com;bnc" then the SSP would route the 
   request to the registered Contact of that AoR, using the normal 
   request routing rules in [draft-gin].  This would result in the 
   SUBSCRIBE being routed to the IP-PBX with a Request URI of 
   "sip:+1234567890@192.1.2.3" for the "reg" event package, instead of 
   being locally processed by the SSP. 
    
5.3. Subscribing for all implicitly registered AoRs 
    
   In order to be useful for provisioning checks, it needs to be 
   possible for an IP-PBX which Registered in bulk using [draft-gin] to 
   learn all of its implicitly Registered AoRs, without knowing them in 
   advance.  To do so, this document defines that the Registered AoR of 
   the IP-PBX (the To URI used in the bulk [draft-gin] REGISTER), 
   return all of the Registered AoRs of the IP-PBX.  In other words, 
   that the explicitly Registered AoR be used in the target URI of a 
   SUBSCRIBE for the "reg" Event Package, to Subscribe to the 
   Registration Event status of all implicitly Registered AoRs of the 
   IP-PBX.  
    
   For example, if the IP-PBX had Registered with a To-URI of 
   "sip:pbx1@ssp.example.com" in its REGISTER request, then it (or any 
   authorized UA) can send a SUBSCRIBE with a Request-URI of 
   "sip:pbx1@ssp.example.com" for the "reg" Event-package and receive 
   Notifications of all of the implicitly Registered AoRs.  One or more 
   of those Registered AoRs MAY be expressed in the NOTIFY using the 
   Bulk-AoR format defined in this document.

5.4. Subscribing to a Bulk-AoR 
    
   Generally it is not expected that a Bulk-AoR URI itself be 
   Subscribed to directly, simply because it is unlikely to be known in 
   advance by other entities and because it provides limited value to 
   do so.  For example, an IP-PBX wishing to verify its provisioned 
   AoRs match what the SSP believes SHOULD NOT subscribe to a Bulk-AoR 
   directly, since it will only learn about that one AoR group and not 
   others which the SSP may incorrectly think the IP-PBX implicitly 
   Registered. 
    
   From a logical perspective, however, a Bulk-AoR is a real URI.  If a 
   SUBSCRIBE is targeted at a Bulk-AoR URI in its Request-URI, then the 
   Registration state information returned MUST be for all of the AoRs 
   matching the range's format.  For example, if a UA SUBSCRIBEs to 
   "sip:+1234;range=0-9(1,8)@@ssp.com", and the authoritative server 
   for "ssp.com" has both Registered AoR information for 
   "sip:+1234;range=0-9(1,8)@ssp.com" as well as for 
   "sip:+123456@ssp.com", both AoRs are returned in the resulting 
   NOTIFY reginfo document. 
    
   [OPEN ISSUE: perhaps we should leave this section out, and only 
   define "Bulk-AoRs" for Notification results but not as legitimate 
   targets of Subscriptions themselves] 
    
6. Event Package registration information 
    
   The Registration Information provided by the Subscription as an XML 
   document is as per [RFC3680], with the additional rules defined in 
   this section.  Note that the structure and schema of the XML 
   document does not change, nor the information contained therein - 
   the document contains Registration information for URIs, as before.  
   The "changes" are simply the rules for when to provide a Bulk-AoR 
   URI entry in particular, and how to process it. 
    
   A Bulk-AoR entry MUST NOT be used for a reginfo XML document unless 
   the Registration state, including Contacts and such, are identical 
   for all AoRs within the indicated range.  Generally, this is only 
   possible when the range of AoRs was implicitly registered through a 
   [draft-gin] type REGISTER mechanism.  This does not mean that a 
   specific AoR within the range cannot have additional Registered 
   Contacts that the other AoRs of the range do not - it can, but those 
   other Contacts are not included in the specific Bulk-AoR XML entry. 
    
6.1. Constructing Bulk-AoR registration elements 
    
   As per [RFC3680], each "registration" element within a reginfo 
   document has three attributes: an "aor", an "id", and a "state" 
   attribute.  For a Bulk-AoR registration element, the "aor" attribute

   value MUST be of the Bulk-AoR form, including the "range" URI user 
   parameter as previously defined.  The "id" MUST be unique, as 
   defined for any registration element in [RFC3680].  
    
   A "contact" element's "uri" attribute value within a Bulk-AoR 
   registration element MUST be the *unexpanded* Contact URI learned 
   from the REGISTER transaction.  In other words, it is without a user 
   portion and with a "bnc" URI parameter, as defined in [draft-gin]. 
   An important property of the [RFC3680] reginfo document is the "id" 
   attribute of elements, which provides a unique index for the URIs, 
   usable in logical tables.  The "id" attribute of the "registration" 
   element is unique per AoR URI, and the "id" of the "contact" element 
   is unique per unique Contact URI.  A Bulk-AoR is just another URI, 
   and as such gets its own registration "id" value.   
    
   A Bulk-AoR with the same user name but a different "range" URI user 
   parameter value is a different Bulk-AoR URI, and thus gets a 
   different ID.  For example, if the range of AoRs is changed, a 
   Notification reginfo document would use a new "id" value for the new 
   Bulk-AoR registration element, and the previous one would be 
   replaced (assuming the reginfo document "state" attribute value was 
   "full"). 
    
6.2. Processing Bulk-AoR registration elements 
    
   A SIP subscriber following [RFC3680] receives notifications, with 
   partial or full state information, for registration state of AoRs 
   and their Contacts.  This document follows that same model for a 
   Bulk-AoR, as if it were any other registration AoR URI. 
    
   Note that the registration tables and rows described in [RFC3680] 
   are purely logical, and do not describe a specific internal 
   implementation. 
    
    
7. Examples 
    
   These will be fleshed out more in later versions of the draft, with 
   explanations of the processing performed at each step.  For the time 
   being, they just show the basic syntax described above. 
    
7.1. Example XML document 
    
   The following is an example registration information document with a 
   Bulk-AoR entry: 
    
   <?xml version="1.0"?> 
      <reginfo xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:reginfo" 
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

      </reginfo> 
    
7.2. Usage Scenario: Subscribing to an AoR 
    
   This example shows a basic bulk REGISTER transaction, followed by a 
   SUBSCRIBE addressed to one of the implicitly registered AoRs.

Appendix A - Rationale for Constraining the Expansion Pattern

   This document's mechanism defines a limited set of patterns which 
   may be used in the "<expansion>" portion of the Bulk-AoR.  This is 
   in contrast to the "Wildcarded AoR" mechanism used in some 
   deployments, which use any regular expressions (regex) for the 
   pattern.  One of the reasons this document restricts the regex 
   syntax is to maintain [RFC3261] compliance, which does not allow 
   common regex characters such as '^', '[', ']','{', and '}' to appear 
   in SIP URIs.   
    
   The other reason this document does not use any arbitrary regex is 
   that one of the goals of this document is to be useful for an IP-PBX 
   to determine provisioning mismatches.  An arbitrary regex is 
   typically useful for verifying a given input string matches the 
   pattern, and not for actually determining the complete set of 
   strings the regex pattern implies.  In other words, a regex is 
   useful for authenticating a given number matches the pattern, but 
   not for determining what all of the provisioned numbers are.  
    
   For example, a regex syntax model for "sip:1234![5-9][0-
   9]*!@example.com" is useful for checking if "sip:123456@example.com" 
   is a matching number, but is extremely difficult for an IP-PBX to 
   verify that the SSP does not include numbers the PBX does not have 
   provisioned.  The IP-PBX could check each of its locally provisioned 
   numbers against the regex pattern, but has no clean way to determine 
   if the set allowed by the regex is not *greater* than its locally 
   provisioned set.   
    
   Furthermore, numerous regex patterns can be used to mean the exact 
   same set.  For example "sip:1234!(5|6|7|8|9)[0-9]*!@example.com", 
   "sip:1234![5-9][0-9]{0,}!@example.com", "sip:1234![5-
   9][[:digits:]]*!@example.com", and "sip:123!4[5-9][0-
   9]*!@example.com" all represent the same set of user strings as the 
   first regex example. 
    
   Therefore, to avoid such issues, this document uses a very narrow 
   set of possible "patterns", which can be used for both matching and 
   provisioning verification.
