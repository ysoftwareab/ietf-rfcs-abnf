      On Forwarding 6LoWPAN Fragments over a Multihop IPv6 Network
                   draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment-05

Abstract

   This document introduces the capability to forward 6LoWPAN fragments.
   This method reduces the latency and increases end-to-end reliability
   in route-over forwarding.  It is the companion to using virtual
   reassembly buffers which is a pure implementation technique.

1.  Introduction

   The original 6LoWPAN fragmentation is defined in [6LoWPAN] and it is
   implicitly defined for use over a single IP hop through possibly
   multiple Layer-2 (mesh-under) hops in a meshed 6LoWPAN Network.
   Although [6LoWPAN-HC] updates [6LoWPAN], it does not redefine 6LoWPAN
   fragmentation.

   This means that over a Layer-3 (route-over) network, an IP packet is
   expected to be reassembled at every hop at the 6LoWPAN sublayer,
   pushed to Layer-3 to be routed, and then fragmented again if the next
   hop is another similar 6LoWPAN link.  This draft introduces an
   alternate approach called 6LoWPAN Fragment Forwarding (FF) whereby an
   intermediate node forwards a fragment as soon as it is received if
   the next hop is a similar 6LoWPAN link.  The routing decision is made
   on the first fragment, which has all the IPv6 routing information.
   The first fragment is forwarded immediately and a state is stored to
   enable forwarding the next fragments along the same path.

   Done right, 6LoWPAN Fragment Forwarding techniques lead to more
   streamlined operations, less buffer bloat and lower latency.  It may
   be wasteful if some fragments are missing after the first one since
   the first fragment will still continue till the 6LoWPAN endpoint that
   will attempt to perform the reassembly, and may be misused to the
   point that performances fall behind that of per-hop recomposition.
   This specification provides a generic overview of FF, discusses
   advantages and caveats, and introduces a particular 6LoWPAN Fragment
   Forwarding technique called Virtual Reassembly Buffer that can be
   used while conserving the message formats defined in [6LoWPAN].

2.  Overview of 6LoWPAN Fragmentation

   We use Figure 1 to illustrate 6LoWPAN fragmentation.  We assume node
   A forwards a packet to node B, possibly as part of a multi-hop route
   between IPv6 source and destination nodes which are neither A nor B.

                  +---+                     +---+
           ... ---| A |-------------------->| B |--- ...
                  +---+                     +---+
                                 # (frag. 5)

             fragmentation                reassembly
                    buffer                buffer

          Figure 1: Fragmentation at node A, reassembly at node B.

   Node A starts by compacting the IPv6 packet using the header
   compression mechanism defined in [6LoWPAN-HC].  If the resulting
   6LoWPAN packet does not fit into a single Link-Layer frame, node A's
   6LoWPAN sublayer cuts it into multiple 6LoWPAN fragments, which it
   transmits as separate Link-Layer frames to node B.  Node B's 6LoWPAN
   sublayer reassembles these fragments, inflates the compressed header
   fields back to the original IPv6 header, and hands over the full IPv6
   packet to its IPv6 layer.

   In Figure 1, a packet forwarded by node A to node B is cut into nine
   fragments, numbered 1 to 9 as follows:

   *  Each fragment is represented by the '#' symbol.

   *  Node A has sent fragments 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 to node B.

   *  Node B has received fragments 1, 2, 3, 6 from node A.

   *  Fragment 5 is still being transmitted at the link layer from node
      A to node B.

   The reassembly buffer for 6LoWPAN is indexed in node B by:

   *  a unique Identifier of Node A (e.g., Node A's Link-Layer address)

   *  the datagram_tag chosen by node A for this fragmented datagram




Watteyne, et al.           Expires 29 May 2020                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             fragment forwarding             November 2019


   Because it may be hard for node B to correlate all possible Link-
   Layer addresses that node A may use (e.g., short vs. long addresses),
   node A must use the same Link-Layer address to send all the fragments
   of the same datagram to node B.

   Conceptually, the reassembly buffer in node B contains:

   *  a datagram_tag as received in the incoming fragments, associated
      to Link-Layer address of node A for which the received
      datagram_tag is unique,

   *  the actual packet data from the fragments received so far, in a
      form that makes it possible to detect when the whole packet has
      been received and can be processed or forwarded,

   *  a state indicating the fragments already received,

   *  a datagram_size,

   *  a timer that allows discarding a partially reassembled packet
      after some timeout.

   A fragmentation header is added to each fragment; it indicates what
   portion of the packet that fragment corresponds to.  Section 5.3 of
   [6LoWPAN] defines the format of the header for the first and
   subsequent fragments.  All fragments are tagged with a 16-bit
   "datagram_tag", used to identify which packet each fragment belongs
   to.  Each datagram can be uniquely identified by the sender Link-
   Layer addresses of the frame that carries it and the datagram_tag
   that the sender allocated for this datagram. [6LoWPAN] also mandates
   that the first fragment is sent first and with a particular format
   that is different than that of the next fragments.  Each fragment but
   the first one can be identified within its datagram by the datagram-
   offset.

   Node B's typical behavior, per [6LoWPAN], is as follows.  Upon
   receiving a fragment from node A with a datagram_tag previously
   unseen from node A, node B allocates a buffer large enough to hold
   the entire packet.  The length of the packet is indicated in each
   fragment (the datagram_size field), so node B can allocate the buffer
   even if the first fragment it receives is not fragment 1.  As
   fragments come in, node B fills the buffer.  When all fragments have
   been received, node B inflates the compressed header fields into an
   IPv6 header, and hands the resulting IPv6 packet to the IPv6 layer
   whihc performs the route lookup.

   This behavior typically results in per-hop fragmentation and

   reassembly.  That is, the packet is fully reassembled, then
   (re)fragmented, at every hop.

3.  Limits of Per-Hop Fragmentation and Reassembly

   There are at least 2 limits to doing per-hop fragmentation and
   reassembly.  See [ARTICLE] for detailed simulation results on both
   limits.

3.1.  Latency

   When reassembling, a node needs to wait for all the fragments to be
   received before being able to generate the IPv6 packet, and possibly
   forward it to the next hop.  This repeats at every hop.

   This may result in increased end-to-end latency compared to a case
   where each fragment is forwarded without per-hop reassembly.

3.2.  Memory Management and Reliability

   Constrained nodes have limited memory.  Assuming a reassembly buffer
   for a 6LoWPAN MTU of 1280 bytes as defined in section 4 of [6LoWPAN],
   typical nodes only have enough memory for 1-3 reassembly buffers.

   To illustrate this we use the topology from Figure 2, where nodes A,
   B, C and D all send packets through node E.  We further assume that
   node E's memory can only hold 3 reassembly buffers.

                  +---+       +---+
          ... --->| A |------>| B |
                  +---+       +---+\
                                    \
                                    +---+    +---+
                                    | E |--->| F | ...
                                    +---+    +---+
                                    /
                                   /
                  +---+       +---+
          ... --->| C |------>| D |
                  +---+       +---+

            Figure 2: Illustrating the Memory Management Issue.

   When nodes A, B and C concurrently send fragmented packets, all 3
   reassembly buffers in node E are occupied.  If, at that moment, node
   D also sends a fragmented packet, node E has no option but to drop
   one of the packets, lowering end-to-end reliability.

4.  Forwarding Fragments

   A 6LoWPAN Fragment Forwarding technique makes the routing decision on
   the first fragment, which is always the one with the IPv6 address of
   the destination.  Upon a first fragment, a forwarding node (e.g. node
   B in a A->B->C sequence) that does fragment forwarding MUST attempt
   to create a state and forward the fragment.  This is an atomic
   operation, and if the first fragment cannot be forwarded then the
   state MUST be removed.  When a forwarding node receives a fragment
   other than a first fragment, it MUST look up state based on the
   source Link-Layer address and the datagram_tag in the received
   fragment.  If no such state is found, the fragment MUST be dropped;
   otherwise the fragment MUST be forwarded using the information in the
   state found.  Since the datagram_tag is uniquely associated to the
   source Link-Layer address of the fragment, the forwarding node MUST
   assign a new datagram_tag from its own namespace for the next hop and
   rewrite the fragment header of each fragment with that datagram_tag.

   Compared to Section 2, the conceptual reassembly buffer in node B now
   contains, assuming that node B is neither the source nor the final
   destination:

   *  a datagram_tag as received in the incoming fragments, associated
      to Link-Layer address of node A for which the received
      datagram_tag is unique,

   *  the Link-Layer address that node B uses as source to forward the
      fragments

   *  the Link-Layer address of the next hop C that is resolved on the
      first fragment

   *  a datagram_tag that node B uniquely allocated for this datagram
      and that is used when forwarding the fragments of the datagram

   *  a datagram_size,

   *  a buffer for the remainder of a previous fragment left to be sent,

   *  a timer that allows discarding the stale FF state after some
      timeout.

   A node that has not received the first fragment cannot forward the
   next fragments.  This means that if node B receives a fragment, node
   A was in possession of the first fragment at some point.  In order to
   keep the operation simple, it makes sense to be consistent with
   [6LoWPAN] and enforce that the first fragment is always sent first.
   When that is done, if node B receives a fragment that is not the



Watteyne, et al.           Expires 29 May 2020                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft             fragment forwarding             November 2019


   first and for which it has no state, then node B treats this as an
   error and refrain from creating a state or attempting to forward.
   This also means that node A should perform all its possible retries
   on the first fragment before it attempts to send the next fragments,
   and that it should abort the datagram and release its state if it
   fails to send the first fragment.

   One benefit of Fragment Forwarding is that the memory that is used to
   store the packet is now distributed along the path, which limits the
   buffer bloat effect.  Multiple fragments may progress in parallel
   along the network as long as they do not interfere.  An associated
   caveat is that on a half duplex radio, if node A sends the next
   fragment at the same time as node B forwards the previous fragment to
   a node C down the path then node B will miss the next fragment.  If
   node C forwards the previous fragment to a node D at the same time
   and on the same frequency as node A sends the next fragment to node
   B, this may result in a hidden terminal problem at B whereby the
   transmission from C interferes with that from A unbeknownst of node
   A.  It results that consecutive fragments must be reasonably spaced
   in order to avoid the 2 forms of collision described above.  A node
   that has multiple packets or fragments to send via different next-hop
   routers may interleave the messages in order to alleviate those
   effects.

5.  Virtual Reassembly Buffer (VRB) Implementation

   Virtual Reassembly Buffer (VRB) is the implementation technique
   described in [LWIG-VRB] in which a forwarder does not reassemble each
   packet in its entirety before forwarding it.

   VRB overcomes the limits listed in Section 3.  Nodes do not wait for
   the last fragment before forwarding, reducing end-to-end latency.
   Similarly, the memory footprint of VRB is just the VRB table,
   reducing the packet drop probability significantly.

   There are, however, limits:

   Non-zero Packet Drop Probability:  The abstract data in a VRB table
      entry contains at a minimum the Link-Layer address of the
      predecessor and that of the successor, the datagram_tag used by
      the predecessor and the local datagram_tag that this node will
      swap with it.  The VRB may need to store a few octets from the
      last fragment that may not have fit within MTU and that will be
      prepended to the next fragment.  This yields a small footprint
      that is 2 orders of magnitude smaller compared to needing a
      1280-byte reassembly buffer for each packet.  Yet, the size of the
      VRB table necessarily remains finite.  In the extreme case where a




Watteyne, et al.           Expires 29 May 2020                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             fragment forwarding             November 2019


      node is required to concurrently forward more packets that it has
      entries in its VRB table, packets are dropped.

   No Fragment Recovery:  There is no mechanism in VRB for the node that
      reassembles a packet to request a single missing fragment.
      Dropping a fragment requires the whole packet to be resent.  This
      causes unnecessary traffic, as fragments are forwarded even when
      the destination node can never construct the original IPv6 packet.

   No Per-Fragment Routing:  All subsequent fragments follow the same
      sequence of hops from the source to the destination node as the
      first fragment, because the IP header is required to route the
      fragment and is only present in the first fragment.  A side effect
      is that the first fragment must always be forwarded first.

   The severity and occurrence of these limits depends on the Link-Layer
   used.  Whether these limits are acceptable depends entirely on the
   requirements the application places on the network.

   If the limits are present and not acceptable for the application,
   future specifications may define new protocols to overcome these
   limits.  One example is [FRAG-RECOV] which defines a protocol which
   allows fragment recovery.

6.  Security Considerations

   Secure joining and the Link-Layer security that it sets up protects
   against those attacks from network outsiders.

   "IP Fragmentation Considered Fragile" [FRAG-ILE] discusses security
   threats that are linked to using IP fragmentation.  The 6LoWPAN
   fragmentation takes place underneath, but some issues described there
   may still apply to 6lo fragments.

   *  Overlapping fragment attacks are possible with 6LoWPAN fragments
      but there is no known firewall operation that would work on
      6LoWPAN fragments at the time of this writing, so the exposure is
      limited.  An implementation of a firewall SHOULD NOT forward
      fragments but recompose the IP packet, check it in the
      uncompressed form, and then forward it again as fragments if
      necessary.

   *  Resource exhaustion attacks are certainly possible and a sensitive
      issue in a constrained network.  An attacker can perform a Denial-
      of-Service (DoS) attack on a node implementing VRB by generating a
      large number of bogus first fragments without sending subsequent
      fragments.  This causes the VRB table to fill up.  When hop-by-hop
      reassembly is used, the same attck can be more damaging if the



Watteyne, et al.           Expires 29 May 2020                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             fragment forwarding             November 2019


      node allocates a full datagram_size for each bogus first fragment.
      With the VRB, the attack can be performed remotely on all nodes
      along a path, but each node suffers a lesser hit. this is because
      the VRB does not need to remember the full datagram as received so
      far but only possibly a few octets from the last fragment that
      could not fit in it.  An implementation MUST protect itself to
      keep the number of VRBs within capacity, and that old VRBs are
      protected by a timer of a reasonable duration for the technology
      and destroyed upon timeout.

   *  Attacks based on predictable fragment identification values are
      also possible but can be avoided.  The datagramp_tag SHOULD be
      assigned pseudo-randomly in order to defeat such attacks.

   *  Evasion of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) leverages
      ambiguity in the reassembly of the fragment.  This sounds
      difficult and mostly useless in a 6LoWPAN network since the
      fragmentation is not end-to-end.
