         Hierarchically Located Addressing and Routing Protocol
                     draft-anonymous-rtgwg-hlarp-00

Abstract

   This internet-draft describes a protocol with an addressing scheme
   where members of the internet are addressed by their physical
   addresses and by an implementing internet router that can contact
   them.  The packets sent by the protocol include handshake messages,
   client data, and the status of the data being sent.  A routing
   procedure is suggested according to special addresses that carry
   information about the region of a router.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   Allocated IP addresses require a fee, are only temporary, and require
   an organization.  An ISP can offer these services at a much greater
   fee.  This internet-draft attempts to provide the permanence of MAC
   addresses and other types of physical addresses for the use of the
   internet.  The infrastructure for physical addressing is already in
   place and already identifies a single transmitting machine.  With IP,
   transmitting machines are identified once more.  The IP addresses are
   distributed for routing purposes and for identification purposes,
   although addressing for routing can be set up without identification.

1.2.  Terminology

      Rank - length of one coordinate

      Root - no coordinates

      Member - user of the HLARP network

      Network Member - member that directly contacts a relay and
      contacts at least one host member

      Host Member - member that represents the user

      Relay - router capable of transferring data between regions that
      implements the described protocol

1.3.  Scope

   This draft focuses on routing and addressing.  The described protocol
   is to be operated between the physical and internet layers.  The
   draft provides a replacement for routing and addressing for IP but
   for no other IP functionality.  Other functionality is provided by
   the internet header within a data packet.  The described protocol
   utilizes addressing features of the physical layer.

2.  Draft Notes

   This notice has been preserved because this is still a draft, and
   this protocol is NOT standardized.  The IETF does NOT permit
   implementors that advertise conformance and/or implementation with
   the described protocol.  This does NOT specify a protocol, but

   describe a proposed protocol to the readers.  A mention of
   specification of the discribed protocol has been accidentally
   included and should be changed and interpreted as this is a
   description.  Any IANA registration requested has NOT been made.  The
   draft has been submitted using a Tor exit node and the owner of the
   displayed IP address is NOT responsible for the content of this
   document.  The rules governing the IETF do NOT permit independant
   publication due to the significant IANA registration of IPv14
   (Section 6).

3.  Addressing

   In HLARP, two types of addresses are used.  A member address is used
   to identify a member of the network.  Internet routers that wish to
   abide by the protocol have no need to use a member address and need a
   different address to route HLARP packets.  A relay address is used to
   identify an implementing relay in routing.

3.1.  Relay Addressing

   A relay address is comprised of two flags, a rank in the areal
   hierarchy, an octet to specify the coordinate system, and two
   coordinates.  Relay addresses are used to locate the relay, and they
   cover an area.  Relays need no identification in their relay address
   because the physical layer already identifies the relay.  This area's
   size is determined by both the mappings from physical locations to
   coordinates, and the length of each coordinate.

              This is the overview of an HLARP relay address.

   A rank of 0 is the root rank and the length of each coordinate will
   not be used, and can be set to 0.  While using any other rank, the
   constant number 1 is to be subtracted from the rank for storage.  The
   maximum 4-bit number is 15, and this rule is made to fit rank 16 into
   the length field.

3.2.  Member Addressing

   Member addresses are used to identify the members of this network of
   networks.  These addresses are relay addresses and the physical
   addresses used for communication in the physical layer.  The relay
   address is the address of a relay that can contact the member.  The
   member address is the address of one end of a route.  This protocol
   makes a temporary fix for network members that are unable to keep
   track of the physical addresses of the host members.  Future versions
   should obselete this functionality.  The member network that is able
   to recieve messages from the closest relay is responsible for
   allocation of 16-bit numbers to physical addresses using the network.
   If the member network has functionality to keep track of connected
   physical addresses, then the network should always give 0 in addition
   to the member's physical address.  The only reason for this is to
   save transmittor power.

             This table shows the layout of a member address.

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

4.  Packets

   An HLARP packet header consists of an special IP version specifier
   (to prevent IP implementers from thinking that it's an IP packet), a
   protocol number, a version number, some flags, a source, and
   destination.  The data will be assumed to be an IP packet with the
   header, to use functionality from the Internet Protocol that this
   protocol doesn't provide.

   The first two octets specify that the header is for HLARP version 0.
   There is an allowance for other protocols and for updates to this
   protocol.  The protocol number is to allow other protocols to
   differentiate themselves and another number may be allocated for use
   in any context.

   The next 6 bytes give error checking capability and ensure data
   integrity.  The first number is calculated by adding each preceeding
   octet into a 10-bit number.  The remaining 4 bytes give the result of

   a CRC-32 computation of the contents of all of the next octet.  This
   gives partial error checking capability on the addresses and data.

   The next octets determine the type of source address, destination
   address, and if the packet is currently being routed through a relay.
   The source and destination address may be a member or a relay, but a
   next relay address has no format options and defaults to a relay
   address.

   The source and destination address are to be stored as stated in
   section 3 (Section 3).  The next relay address is described in
   section 3.1 (Section 3.1), and can not be a member address.  The
   address after the source addresss will be guaranteed to be the
   address that needs to process the packet.

   There are different operations that can be performed, like data
   transfer, status reporting, pinging, and searching for a relay.  The
   operations change how the information following the header is to be
   interpreted.

4.1.  Operation 0 - DATA

   Operation 0 will be a very frequently used operation, hence the
   number with no one bits.  The body of a data packet would have the IP
   header and body.  The IP address fields would still allocated in the
   packet to ease adjustments by implementors of this protocol that
   already use IP.  This is also to save transmittor power.

4.2.  Operation 1 - STATUS

   Operation 1 is a message sent to a member that notifies it of the
   status of the operation 0 message that it sent.  Implementing relays
   do not need to be send the operation 1 message to members.  A message
   of operation 1 has a single octet for the body.  The octet is a
   number that is selected from the list at the section's bottom and may
   be expanded in future versions.  If status code 8, 9, or 10 is used,
   then the relay will give a null-terminated string appended to its
   8-bit length.  A zero-length string would be permitted, in which case
   a null character is appended instead of a string.

   The provided status code could be important information for the user
   regaining access.  Even successful transmissions should be responded
   to with a status code for debugging purposes and to discourage DoS
   attacks.

4.3.  Operation 2 - RELAY_REQ

   Operation 2 is a member's request for relay services.  The
   destination may be a relay or a member.  This operation is for a
   member that is trying to get direct relay service and multiple relays
   on the medium.  If the member is searching, then the physical layer
   will broadcast the message with operation 2 and use a multicast
   address for the physical recipient.  If the member has selected a
   relay offer to accept, then it wil send the message to the physical

   address that sent it.  In an operation 2 message, there is no body,
   or the body is of length zero.

4.4.  Operation 3 - RELAY_OFFER

   Operation 3 notifies the member of an offer of service.  Any
   unrequested responses are to be treated as DoS attacks if repeated.
   There is no body to a message with operation 3 and the length is
   zero.

5.  Routing

   The routing process is short-sided and depends on each relay.  The
   sending member doesn't need to generate an entire route in order to
   send the data to the next relay.  This is a 4-step process that a
   single implementing relay could use.  This process is a suggestion
   that was devised according to the addressing scheme.  A relay can be
   called out for not reaching certain destinations and recieve less-
   than-desirable traffic.

   Step 1:

   When a relay recieves a packet and runs is willing and ready to serve
   the client, then it will determine the next relay or destination.  If
   the coordinate system, x coordinate, and y coordinate of itself and
   of the destination matches, and the length of itself is the same,
   then the relay will relay the packet to the destination.

   Step 2:

   Otherwise, the relay must determine the next relay in the route.  If
   the coordinate system doesn't match, then the relay will target the
   root relay (setting the root relay as the target relay).

   Step 3:

   If the coordinate system matches, then the relay will perform an XNOR
   operation on the x coordinate of the current relay and the target
   relay.  The same XNOR operation will be performed on the y coordinate
   of both relays.  Both results will be combined with an AND operation,
   resulting in a single descriptor of the length.  The relay will count
   the amount of consecutive one bits, and start from the left.  The
   amount of consecutive one bits is the length.  The relay will still
   need to subract 1 from the length for storage and transmission.

   Step 4:

   The lengths of the current and target relay should be tested if they
   differ by a number that is greater than 4, so that the current relay
   doesn't need to be very accurate.  The lengths should differ by 4 if
   the length difference is greater than 4.  This step will not change
   the evaluation of l1 > l2 where l1 is the length of the current relay
   and l2 is the length of the target relay.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This section is NOT an active request, as this document is an
   Internet-Draft.  DO NOT update ANY registries according to this
   section.  This section is ONLY for people who wish to publish this as
   an RFC so for their convenience in changing to RFCs.

   This draft would request the assignment of IPv14 in the Version
   Numbers [1], for the experimental and other protocols.  An 8-bit list
   is requested for the enumerated protocols themselves.  This list is
   the protocols list for any other protocols of this scope to use.  A
   4-bit list is also requested, independant of the other list, for the
   HLARP version numbers.

   IANA would be tasked with mapping the latitude-longtitude coordinate
   system of Earth with a 2-dimensional 16-bit-per-dimension coordinate
   system.  The allocation of sub-area IDs has no dependance on IANA.
   IANA is requested to plot the points and to plot powers of two and
   their decrements to align with real-world borders and obstacles (for
   example, x = 32767 and 32768 could align with the borders of Europe
   and the Americas).  For anti-tracking purposes, the location
   information can not be more accurate than current IP address
   trackers.  This would make the assignments vary in length, and the
   rest of the x and y field can be filled with zeros, regardless of
   where the network member locates itself within the specified area.

7.  Security Considerations

   Within the scope of this draft are the security issues of
   authentication and eavesdropping.  Data integrity and undeniable
   service are issues for all areas of the internet.  This draft, while
   not giving DoS protection, discourages people from launching these
   attacks themselves.  The status operation is a feature that would
   flood an attacker's medium of transmission.  The protocol gives weak
   verification for the integrity of the data.  The protocol gives no
   protection from attackers that wish to read or alter the data.  It is
   expected that the transport layer will provide data security.
