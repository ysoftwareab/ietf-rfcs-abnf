1. Introduction 

   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), also known as Transparent LAN 
   Service and Virtual Private Switched Network Service, is a Layer 2 
   Service that emulates LAN service across a Wide Area Network (WAN) 
   [RFC4664]. The primary motivation behind Virtual Private LAN 
   Services (VPLS) is to provide connectivity between geographically 
   dispersed customer sites across the service provider network, as if 
   they were connected using a LAN. 

   Recently VPLS has become quite popular, and will be deployed in more 
   and larger networks. Also, since there has been much progress in 
   network convergence, whereby multiple kinds of customer services, 
   such as VPLS and IP VPN [RFC4364] etc., would be carried over a 
   single, consolidated IP/MPLS network.

   Currently there are some options to deploy VPLS services, and 
   operators need to choose the most suitable technology according to 
   their requirement and the work load in network deployment and 
   operation. 

   This document analyzes the deployment of typical VPLS network with 
   existing solutions, and discusses the features of each solution. In 
   addition, this document indicates that the advantages of the 
   existing VPLS mechanisms may be integrated to achieve easier and 
   more efficient VPLS provisioning. 

2. Deployment of VPLS Network 

   This section describes the operation of a VPLS network with existing 
   solutions. General topology of a VPLS network is shown in Figure 1. 
   There are N PEs in the network, and V VPLS instances are deployed in 
   the network.

2.1. Deployment Considerations of LDP based VPLS 

   [RFC4762] describes the control plane of signaling pseudowire labels 
   for VPLS service using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).  

   For LDP signaling, full-mesh targeted LDP sessions need to be 
   established among VPLS PEs. For a network with N PEs, there would be 
   N*(N-1) targeted LDP sessions. If N is large, the deployment would 
   be configuration intensive. Besides, [RFC4762] does not provide 
   mechanism for membership auto-discovery, by default the identities 
   of all the remote pseudowire endpoints in each VPLS instance need to 
   be manually configured on each PE. Thus if a new site or a new PE is 
   added to one VPLS, configurations of all the other PEs need to be 
   updated. Besides, in large scale VPLS networks, the overhead of 
   maintaining full meshed N*(N-1) LDP sessions would be an issue.

   While this could be alleviated by Hierarchical VPLS (H-VPLS), the 
   expense is additional complexity in provisioning and operation. 

   When using LDP based mechanism to deploy a VPLS network, one unique 
   VPLS Identifier needs to be assigned for each VPLS instance. 

   Section 3.2.2 of [RFC6074] specifies BGP based Auto-Discovery (BGP-
   AD) mechanism for VPLS service. This mechanism can be combinely used 
   with LDP based VPLS signaling, which would reduce the overhead of PW 
   endpoint configuration, and even the establishment of targeted LDP 
   sessions may be automatically triggered by BGP auto-discovery. 

   However, when BGP-AD is used with LDP signaling, in addition to BGP 
   sessions established for membership auto-discovery, it is still 
   required to set up fully meshed targeted LDP sessions for pseudowire 
   signaling, regardless of whether the LDP sessions are manually 
   configured or automatically established. Thus in this case operators 
   need to deploy and maintain both BGP and targeted LDP to offer VPLS 
   services. And the signaling overhead in this case would be higher 
   than both LDP signaling without BGP-AD and BGP based VPLS in 
   [RFC4761]. 

   Using LDP based VPLS signaling, the pseudowire labels are allocated 
   "on-demand" for each remote endpoints in each VPLS instance, thus 
   label resources are utilized efficiently.  

   MAC Address Withdrawal mechanism is defined in LDP based VPLS to 
   expedite removal of MAC addresses in some topology changes. And 
   status information of the pseudowires can be exchanged using 
   mechanism in [RFC4447]. These features could make operation and 
   maintenance of VPLS more efficient and convenient. 

2.2. Deployment Considerations of BGP based VPLS 

   [RFC4761] describes the BGP based auto-discovery and signaling 
   mechanism for VPLS.  

   BGP based VPLS mechanism combines VPLS membership auto-discovery and 
   signaling into a single BGP Update message, which achieves quite low 
   signaling overhead and allows operational convergence with IP VPN.  

   The control plane of BGP based VPLS could inherit the scalability 
   mechanism from BGP, thus full meshed signaling sessions among VPLS 
   PEs can be avoided by deploying route reflectors [RFC4456]. Each PE 
   can just establish one BGP session with route reflector.

Internet-Draft              VPLS Analysis                   March 2011 
    

   To deploy a BGP based VPLS service, operator needs to assign a 
   unique VE-ID for each PE in given VPLS instance. As VE-IDs cannot be 
   generated automatically and requires coordination among all the PEs 
   in the same VPLS, this may introduce management burden to operators, 
   especially in multi-area and multi-AS scenarios. Similar to IP VPN, 
   Route Targets are used to identify different VPLS instances. 

   The pseudowire discriminators are advertised in form of label blocks. 
   Although this avoids the control plane load of sending individual 
   label signaling messages to each remote PE, the use of label block 
   is based on idea of "allocate in advance" and "over-provisioning" 
   and in many cases the allocation of label resources may be not quite 
   efficient compared with "on-demand" label allocation for each 
   discovered remote endpoint. Besides, the size of label block 
   allocated could be impacted by VE-IDs of remote PEs, which makes the 
   management more complicated, and exposes a potential security issue. 
   An example of VE-ID assignment and label block allocation is 
   described as below:  

   For ease of VE-ID management and future network expansion, operator 
   may assign a set of blocks of VE-ID for different regions of the 
   network, as shown in Figure 2, VE-ID 1-100 are assigned to region 1, 
   and VE-ID 101-200 are assigned to region 2. According to the 
   mechanism in [RFC4761], in order to establish VPLS pseudowire with a 
   PE in region 2, say the VE-ID is 102, PE1 needs to allocate a label 
   block with the size of at least 102, even if in the beginning only 
   less than 10 PEs are deployed in each region. If the number of VPLS 
   instances V in the network is large, the amount of labels wasted 
   altogether may not be neglectable.

   Currently BGP based VPLS does not provide mechanisms of MAC address 
   withdrawal and pseudowire status notification. 

3. Comparison of Existing VPLS Solutions 

   As analyzed in section 2, both LDP based and BGP based VPLS 
   solutions have some advantages and disadvantages. These are 
   summarized in Table 1.  

   VPLS service provisioning consists of membership discovery and 
   pseudowire signaling. VPLS membership can be either manually 
   configured, or auto-discovered through BGP auto-discovery mechanism. 
   According to Table 1, it is obvious that BGP-AD is an important 
   feature which significantly reduces the overhead of manual 
   provisioning in LDP based VPLS, with the expense of coexistence of 
   two control plane protocols and additional signaling sessions and 
   messages. BGP based VPLS combines auto-discovery and signaling into 
   a single Update message at the cost of potential waste of label 
   resources. 

   While VPLS provides multipoint service, the underlying 
   infrastructure is full-mesh point-to-point pseudowires. Thus the on-

   demand label allocation mechanism in LDP signaling could provide 
   better efficiency in label resource utilization. 

   Regarding the control plane scalability, the big challenge with LDP 
   VPLS is maintenance of full-mesh targeted LDP sessions, while in BGP 
   VPLS this problem can be easily solved with route reflection.  

   Some service providers may have already deployed IP VPN service in 
   their networks which uses BGP as signaling protocol, and plan to 
   provide VPLS service in the same network, in this case they may 
   prefer to deploy VPLS using the same technology as IP VPN to 
   simplify service provisioning and network operation.

             Table 1. Comparison of existing VPLS solutions 
    

   To simply VPLS service provisioning, BGP based auto-discovery would 
   becomes a mandatory feature. The concerns about LDP based VPLS with 
   BGP-AD may be the scalability issue and burden of full-mesh targeted 
   LDP sessions. While control plane of BGP based VPLS is more scalable 
   and achieves convergence with IP VPN, inefficiency in label resource 
   utilization and complexity in VE-ID management may influence 
   operators' choice. 

   Actually there may be one solution which integrates the advantages 
   and avoid those disadvantages:

   a. BGP-AD in [RFC6074] is used for membership auto-discovery. 

   b. After auto-discovery of members in each VPLS, instead of 
      establishing targeted LDP sessions, the BGP sessions which are 
      already established for BGP-AD can be re-used to execute signaling 
      functions in a similar way to LDP VPLS, i.e. using BGP to perform 
      on-demand pseudowire label allocation, MAC address withdrawal and 
      pseudowire status notification.  

   In this way, the VPLS provisioning could be simplified by BGP-AD, 
   and there would be no need of setting up any targeted LDP session in 
   the VPLS network. Label resource could be allocated efficiently and 
   the complexity of VE-ID management would be avoided. BGP is the only 
   control plane protocol and the operation convergence with IP VPN can 
   be achieved. Detailed specification about extensions for this 
   solution would be described in a separate document and is outside 
   the scope of this document. 

4. Security Considerations 

   This document does not change the security properties of VPLS.
