   by a type code.  However, no IANA registry exists for this type code.
   This document requests IANA to create such a registry.


1.  Introduction

   The base BGP specification [RFC4271] specifies in Section 4.2 a
   mechanism to include optional parameters with the OPEN message.
   Optional parameters are identified by the Parameter Type, which is a
   one-octet unsigned binary integer.

   Two Parameter Type codes are currently defined:

   o  Parameter Type 1: Authentication (deprecated).

   o  Parameter Type 2: Capabilities ([RFC3392])

   This document requests that IANA create and maintain a registry for
   OPEN message optional parameters.


2.  Acknowledgements

   Elwyn Davies pointed out that a registry for OPEN Options was needed.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA create and maintain a registry for
   "BGP OPEN Optional Parameter Type", as discussed above.  Values are
   to be allocated according to the "IETF Consensus" policy as defined
   in [RFC5226].


4.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no security issues.
