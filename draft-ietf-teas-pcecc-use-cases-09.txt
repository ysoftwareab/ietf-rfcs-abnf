The Use Cases for Path Computation Element (PCE) as a Central Controller
                                (PCECC).

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of a Software-
   Defined Networking (SDN) system.  It can compute optimal paths for
   traffic across a network and can also update the paths to reflect
   changes in the network or traffic demands.  PCE was developed to
   derive paths for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), which are supplied
   to the head end of the LSP using the Path Computation Element
   Communication Protocol (PCEP).

   SDN has a broader applicability than signaled MPLS traffic-engineered
   (TE) networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range
   of use cases including static LSPs, segment routing (SR), Service
   Function Chaining (SFC), and most forms of a routed or switched
   network.  It is, therefore, reasonable to consider PCEP as a control
   protocol for use in these environments to allow the PCE to be fully
   enabled as a central controller.

   A PCE as a Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of
   a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and
   without necessarily completely replacing it.  This document describes
   general considerations for PCECC deployment and examines its
   applicability and benefits, as well as its challenges and
   limitations, through a number of use cases.  PCEP extensions required
   for stateful PCE usage are covered in separate documents.

1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] was developed to offload
   the path computation function from routers in an MPLS traffic-
   engineered (TE) network.  It can compute optimal paths for traffic
   across a network and can also update the paths to reflect changes in
   the network or traffic demands.  Since then, the role and function of
   the PCE have grown to cover a number of other uses (such as GMPLS
   [RFC7025]) and to allow delegated control [RFC8231] and PCE-initiated
   use of network resources [RFC8281].

   According to [RFC7399], Software-Defined Networking (SDN) refers to a
   separation between the control elements and the forwarding components
   so that software running in a centralized system, called a
   controller, can act to program the devices in the network to behave
   in specific ways.  A required element in an SDN architecture is a
   component that plans how the network resources will be used and how
   the devices will be programmed.  It is possible to view this
   component as performing specific computations to place traffic flows
   within the network given knowledge of the availability of network

   resources, how other forwarding devices are programmed, and the way
   that other flows are routed.  This is the function and purpose of a
   PCE, and the way that a PCE integrates into a wider network control
   system (including an SDN system) is presented in [RFC7491].

   [RFC8283] introduces the architecture for the PCE as a central
   controller as an extension to the architecture described in [RFC4655]
   and assumes the continued use of PCEP as the protocol used between
   the PCE and PCC.  [RFC8283] further examines the motivations and
   applicability for PCEP as a Southbound Interface (SBI) and introduces
   the implications for the protocol.

   [RFC9050] introduces the procedures and extensions for PCEP to
   support the PCECC architecture [RFC8283].

   This draft describes the various other usecases for the PCECC
   architecture.

3.1.  Use Cases of PCECC for Label Management

   As per [RFC8283], in some cases, the PCE-based controller can take
   responsibility for managing some part of the MPLS label space for
   each of the routers that it controls, and it may taker wider
   responsibility for partitioning the label space for each router and
   allocating different parts for different uses, communicating the
   ranges to the router using PCEP.

   [RFC9050] describe a mode where LSPs are provisioned as explicit
   label instructions at each hop on the end-to-end path.  Each router
   along the path must be told what label forwarding instructions to
   program and what resources to reserve.  The controller uses PCEP to
   communicate with each router along the path of the end-to-end LSP.
   For this to work, the PCE- based controller will take responsibility
   for managing some part of the MPLS label space for each of the
   routers that it controls.  An extension to PCEP could be done to
   allow a PCC to inform the PCE of such a label space to control.  (See
   [I-D.li-pce-controlled-id-space] for a possible PCEP extension to
   support advertisement of the MPLS label space to the PCE to control.)

   [RFC8664] specifies extensions to PCEP that allow a stateful PCE to
   compute, update or initiate SR-TE paths.
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr] describes the
   mechanism for PCECC to allocate and provision the node/prefix/
   adjacency label (SID) via PCEP.  To make such allocation PCE needs to
   be aware of the label space from Segment Routing Global Block (SRGB)
   or Segment Routing Local Block (SRLB) [RFC8402] of the node that it
   controls.  A mechanism for a PCC to inform the PCE of such a label
   space to control is needed within PCEP.  The full SRGB/SRLB of a node
   could be learned via existing IGP or BGP-LS mechanism too.

   Further, there have been various proposals for Global Labels in MPLS,
   the PCECC architecture could be used as means to learn the label
   space of nodes, and could also be used to determine and provision the
   global label range.

   *  PCC would advertise the PCECC capability to the PCE (central
      controller-PCECC) [RFC9050].

   *  The PCECC could also learn the label range set aside by the PCC
      ([I-D.li-pce-controlled-id-space]).

   *  Optionally, the PCECC could determine the shared MPLS global label
      range for the network.

      -  In the case that the shared global label range need to be
         negotiated across multiple domains, the central controllers of
         these domains would also need to negotiate a common global
         label range across domains.

      -  The PCECC would need to set the shared global label range to
         all PCC nodes in the network.

3.2.  Using PCECC for SR

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  Using
   SR, a source node steers a packet through a path without relying on
   hop-by-hop signaling protocols such as LDP or RSVP-TE.  Each path is
   specified as an ordered list of instructions called "segments".  Each
   segment is an instruction to route the packet to a specific place in
   the network, or to perform a specific service on the packet.  A
   database of segments can be distributed through the network using a

   routing protocol (such as IS-IS or OSPF) or by any other means.  PCEP
   (and PCECC) could be one such means.

   [RFC8664] specify the SR specific PCEP extensions.  PCECC may further
   use PCEP protocol for SR SID (Segment Identifier) distribution to the
   SR nodes (PCC) with some benefits.  If the PCECC allocates and
   maintains the SID in the network for the nodes and adjacencies; and
   further distributes them to the SR nodes directly via the PCEP
   session has some advantage over the configurations on each SR node
   and flooding via IGP, especially in a SDN environment.

   When the PCECC is used for the distribution of the node SID and
   adjacency SID, the node SID is allocated from the SRGB of the node.
   For the allocation of adjacency SID, the allocation is from the SRLB
   of the node as described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr].

   [RFC8355] identifies various protection and resiliency usecases for
   SR.  Path protection lets the ingress node be in charge of the
   failure recovery (used for SR-TE).  Also protection can be performed
   by the node adjacent to the failed component, commonly referred to as
   local protection techniques or fast-reroute (FRR) techniques.  In
   case of PCECC, the protection paths can be pre-computed and setup by
   the PCE.

   The following example illustrate the use case where the node SID and
   adjacency SID are allocated by the PCECC.

3.2.1.  PCECC SID Allocation

   Each node (PCC) is allocated a node-SID by the PCECC.  The PCECC
   needs to update the label map of each node to all the nodes in the
   domain.  On receiving the label map, each node (PCC) uses the local
   routing information to determine the next-hop and download the label
   forwarding instructions accordingly.  The forwarding behavior and the
   end result is same as IGP based Node-SID in SR.  Thus, from anywhere
   in the domain, it enforces the ECMP-aware shortest-path forwarding of
   the packet towards the related node.

   For each adjacency in the network, PCECC can allocate an Adj-SID.
   The PCECC sends PCInitiate message to update the label map of each
   Adj to the corresponding nodes in the domain.  Each node (PCC)
   download the label forwarding instructions accordingly.  The
   forwarding behavior and the end result is similar to IGP based "Adj-
   SID" in SR.

   These mechanism are described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr].

3.2.2.  Use Cases of PCECC for SR Best Effort (BE) Path

   In this mode of the solution, the PCECC just need to allocate the
   node SID (without calculating the explicit path for the SR path).
   The ingress of the forwarding path just need to encapsulate the
   destination node SID on top of the packet.  All the intermediate
   nodes will forward the packet based on the destination node SID.  It
   is similar to the LDP LSP.

   R1 may send a packet to R8 simply by pushing an SR header with
   segment list {1008} (Node SID for R8).  The path would be the based
   on the routing/nexthop calculation on the routers.

3.2.3.  Use Cases of PCECC for SR Traffic Engineering (TE) Path

   SR-TE paths may not follow an IGP SPT.  Such paths may be chosen by a
   PCECC and provisioned on the ingress node of the SR-TE path.  The SR
   header consists of a list of SIDs (or MPLS labels).  The header has
   all necessary information so that, the packets can be guided from the
   ingress node to the egress node of the path; hence, there is no need
   for any signaling protocol.  For the case where strict traffic
   engineering path is needed, all the adjacency SID are stacked,
   otherwise a combination of node-SID or adj-SID can be used for the
   SR-TE paths.

   Note that the bandwidth reservations is only guaranteed at controller
   and through the enforce of the bandwidth admission control.  As for
   the RSVP-TE LSP case, the control plane signaling also does the link
   bandwidth reservation in each hop of the path.

   The SR traffic engineering path examples are explained as bellow:

   Note that the node SID for each node is allocated from the SRGB and
   adjacency SID for each link are allocated from the SRLB for each
   node.

   Example 1:

   R1 may send a packet P1 to R8 simply by pushing an SR header with
   segment list {1008}.  Based on the best path, it could be:
   R1-R2-R3-R8.

   Example 2:

   R1 may send a packet P2 to R8 by pushing an SR header with segment
   list {1002, 9001, 1008}.  The path should be: R1-R2-link1-R3-R8.

   Example 3:

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                       March 2022


   R1 may send a packet P3 to R8 via R4 by pushing an SR header with
   segment list {1004, 1008}.  The path could be : R1-R2-R4-R3-R8

   The local protection examples for SR TE path are explained below:

   Example 4: local link protection:

   *  R1 may send a packet P4 to R8 by pushing an SR header with segment
      list {1002, 9001, 1008}.  The path should be: R1-R2-link1-R3-R8.

   *  When node R2 receives the packet from R1 which has the header of
      link1-R3-R8, and also find out there is a link failure of link1,
      then the R2 can enforce the traffic over the bypass to send out
      the packet with header of R3-R8 through link2.

   Example 5: local node protection:

   *  R1 may send a packet P5 to R8 by pushing an SR header with segment
      list {1004, 1008}.  The path could be : R1-R2-R4-R3-R8.

   *  When node R2 receives the packet from R1 which has the header of
      {1004, 1008}, and also finds out there is a node failure for
      node4, then it can enforce the traffic over the bypass and send
      out the packet with header of {1005, 1008} to node5 instead of
      node4.

3.2.4.  SR Policy

   [RFC8402] defines Segment Routing architecture, which uses a SR
   Policy to steer packets from a node through a ordered list of
   segments.  The SR Policy could be configured on the headed or
   instantiated by an SR controller.  The SR architecture does not
   restrict how the controller programs the network.  The options are
   Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF), PCEP, and BGP.  SR Policy
   can be based on either SR-MPLS or SRv6 dataplane.

   A SR Policy architecture is described in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  An SR Policy is a
   framework that enables the instantiation of an ordered list of
   segments on a node for implementing a source routing policy for the
   steering of traffic for a specific purpose (e.g. for a specific SLA)
   from that node.

   A SR Policy is identified through the tuple <headend, color,
   endpoint>.  In the context of a specific headend, one may identify an
   SR policy by the <color, endpoint> tuple.





Li, et al.              Expires 8 September 2022               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                       March 2022


   The headend is the node where the policy is instantiated/implemented.
   The endpoint indicates the destination of the policy.  The color is a
   32-bit numerical value that associates the SR Policy with an intent
   or objective.

   A SR Policy should have one or more Candidate Paths.  A candidate
   path is the unit for signaling of an SR Policy to a headend via
   protocol extensions like [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp] or
   BGP SR Policy [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].  Each
   candidate path must have one or mode Segment-Lists.  A Segment- List
   represents a specific source-routed path to send traffic from the
   headend to the endpoint of the corresponding SR Policy.

   A candidate path is either dynamic, explicit, or composite.  For
   PCECC use case a candidate path should be either dynamic (i.e. when
   PCE provides its according to specific optimization objective) or
   composite (a composite candidate path construct enables the
   combination of SR Policies, each with explicit candidate paths and/or
   dynamic candidate paths with potentially different optimization
   objectives and constraints).

   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp] defines a new ASSOCIATION
   type that binds previously separated LSPs in the PCEP (Candidate
   Paths) into common SR Policy hierarchy.  This is applicable in the
   PCECC scenario as well.

   Further one could also use the PCECC mechanism directly to create an
   SR policy container at the PCC by defining a new CCI for it.  The
   advantage of that approach would be to allow SR Policy to be created
   without signaling candidate paths.

3.3.  Use Cases of PCECC for TE LSP

   In the Section 3.2 the case of SR path via PCECC is discussed.
   Although those cases give the simplicity and scalability, but there
   are existing functionalities for the traffic engineering path such as
   the bandwidth guarantee, monitoring where SR based solution are
   complex.  Also there are cases where the depth of the label stack is
   an issue for existing deployment and certain vendors.












Li, et al.              Expires 8 September 2022               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                       March 2022


   So to address these issues, PCECC architecture also support the TE
   LSP functionalities.  To achieve this, the existing PCEP can be used
   to communicate between the PCECC and nodes along the path.  This is
   similar to static LSPs, where LSPs can be provisioned as explicit
   label instructions at each hop on the end-to-end path.  Each router
   along the path must be told what label-forwarding instructions to
   program and what resources to reserve.  The PCE-based controller
   keeps a view of the network and determines the paths of the end-to-
   end LSPs, and the controller uses PCEP to communicate with each
   router along the path of the end-to-end LSP.

      optimization criteria.

   *  PCECC would calculate the optimal path according to given
      constrains (e.g. bandwidth).

   *  PCECC would provision each node along the path and assign incoming
      and outgoing labels from R1 to R8 with the path: {R1, link1,
      1001}, {1001, R2, link3, 2003], {2003, R4, link10, 4010}, {4010,
      R3, link8, 3008}, {3008, R8}.

   *  For the end to end protection, PCECC program each node along the
      path from R1 to R8 with the secondary path: {R1, link2, 1002},
      {1002, R2, link4, 2004], {2004, R5, link7, 5007}, {5007, R3,
      link9, 3009}, {3009, R8}.

   *  It is also possible to have a bypass path for the local protection
      setup by the PCECC.  For example, the primary path as above, then
      to protect the node R4 locally, PCECC can program the bypass path
      like this: {R2, link5, 2005}, {2005, R3}. By doing this, the node
      R4 is locally protected at R2.

3.3.1.  PCECC Load Balancing (LB) Use Case

   Very often many service providers use TE tunnels for solving issues
   with non-deterministic paths in their networks.  One example of such
   applications is usage of TEs in the mobile backhaul (MBH).  Consider
   the following topology -

                              TE1 -------------->
+---------+    +--------+    +--------+    +--------+    +------+  +---+

     |  SubRing 1  |    Ring 1    | |           | |          |
+---------+    +--------+    +--------+         | |          |
| Access  |    | Access |    | AGG 2  |         | |          |
| SubNode2|    | Node 2 |    +--------+         | |          |
+---------+    +--------+         | |           | |          |
     |             |              | |           | |          |
     |             |              | +----TE2----|-+          |
+---------+    +--------+    +--------+    +--------+    +------+  +---+

| SubNodeN|----| Node N |    +--------+    +--------+    +------+  +---+
+---------+    +--------+

   This MBH architecture uses L2 access rings and sub-rings.  L3 starts
   at the aggregation layer.  For the sake of simplicity, the figure
   shows only one access sub-ring, access ring and aggregation ring
   (AGG1...AGGN), connected by Nx10GE interfaces.  Aggregation domain

   runs its own IGP.  There are two Egress routers (AGG N-1,AGG N) that
   are connected to the Core domain via L2 interfaces.  Core also have
   connections to service routers, RSVP-TEs are used for MPLS transport
   inside the ring.  There could be at least 2 tunnels (one way) from
   each AGG router to egress AGG routers.  There are also many L2 access
   rings connected to AGG routers.

   Service deployment made by means of either L2VPNs (VPLS) or L3VPNs.
   Those services use MPLS TE as transport towards egress AGG routers.
   TE tunnels could be also used as transport towards service routers in
   case of seamless MPLS based architecture in the future.

   There is a need to solve the following tasks:

   *  Perform automatic load-balance amongst TE tunnels according to
      current traffic load.

   *  TE bandwidth (BW) management: Provide guaranteed BW for specific
      service: HSI, IPTV, etc., provide time-based BW reservation (BoD)
      for other services.

   *  Simplify development of TE tunnels by automation without any
      manual intervention.

   *  Provide flexibility for Service Router placement (anywhere in the
      network by creation of transport LSPs to them).

   Since other tasks are already considered by other PCECC use cases, in
   this section, the focus is on load balancing (LB) task.  LB task
   could be solved by means of PCECC in the following way:

   *  After application or network service or operator can ask SDN
      controller (PCECC) for LSP based load balancing between AGG X and
      AGG N/AGG N-1 (egress AGG routers which have connections to core).
      Each of these would have associated constrains (i.e. bandwidth,
      inclusion or exclusion specific links or nodes, number of paths,
      objective function (OF), need for disjoint LSP paths etc.).

   *  PCECC could calculate multiple (say N) LSPs according to given
      constrains, calculation is based on results of Objective Function
      (OF) [RFC5541], constraints, endpoints, same or different
      bandwidth (BW) , different links (in case of disjoint paths) and
      other constrains.

   *  Depending on given LSP Path setup type (PST), PCECC would use
      download instructions to the PCC.  At this stage it is assumed the
      PCECC is aware of the label space it controls and in case of SR
      the SID allocation and distribution is already done.



Li, et al.              Expires 8 September 2022               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                       March 2022


   *  PCECC would send PCInitiate message [RFC8281] towards ingress AGG
      X router(PCC) for each of N LSPs and receives PCRpt PCEP message
      [RFC8231] back from PCCs.  If the PST is PCECC-SR, the PCECC would
      include the SID stack as per [RFC8664].  If the PST is PCECC
      (basic), then the PCECC would assigns labels along the calculated
      path; and set up the path by sending central controller
      instructions in PCEP message to each node along the path of the
      LSP as per [RFC9050] and then send PCUpd message to the ingress
      AGG X router with information about new LSP and AGG X(PCC) would
      respond with PCRpt with LSP status.

   *  AGG X as ingress router now have N LSPs towards AGG N and AGG N-1
      which are available for installing to router's forwarding and LB
      of traffic between them.  Traffic distribution between those LSPs
      depends on particular realization of hash-function on that router.

   *  Since PCECC is aware of TEDB (TE state) and LSP-DB, it can manage
      and prevent possible over-subscriptions and limit number of
      available LB states.  Via PCECC mechanism the control can take
      quick actions into the network by directly provisioning the
      central control instructions.

3.3.2.  PCECC and Inter-AS TE

   There are various signaling options for establishing Inter-AS TE LSP:
   contiguous TE LSP [RFC5151], stitched TE LSP [RFC5150], nested TE LSP
   [RFC4206].

   Requirements for PCE-based Inter-AS setup [RFC5376] describe the
   approach and PCEP functionality that are needed for establishing
   Inter-AS TE LSPs.

   [RFC5376] also gives Inter- and Intra-AS PCE Reference Model that is
   provided below in shorten form for the sake of simplicity.

     Figure 3: Shorten form of Inter- and Intra-AS PCE Reference Model
                                 [RFC5376]

   The PCECC belonging to different domain can co-operate to setup
   inter-AS TE LSP.  The stateful H-PCE [RFC8751] mechanism could also
   be used to first establish a per-domain PCECC LSP.  These could be
   stitched together to form inter-AS TE LSP as described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-interdomain].

   For the sake of simplicity, here after the focus is on a simplified
   Inter-AS case when both AS1 and AS2 belong to the same service
   provider administration.  In that case Inter and Intra-AS PCEs could
   be combined in one single PCE if such combined PCE performance is
   enough for handling all path computation request and setup.  There is
   a potential to use a single PCE for both ASes if the scalability and
   performance are enough.  The PCE would require interfaces (PCEP and
   BGP-LS) to both domains.  PCECC redundancy mechanisms are described
   in [RFC8283].  Thus routers in AS1 and AS2 (PCCs) can send PCEP
   messages towards same PCECC.

   In a case of PCECC Inter-AS TE scenario where service provider
   controls both domains (AS1 and AS2), each of them have own IGP and
   MPLS transport.  There is a need is to setup Inter-AS LSPs for
   transporting different services on top of them (Voice, L3VPN etc.).
   Inter-AS links with different capacity exist in several regions.  The
   task is not only to provision those Inter-AS LSPs with given
   constrains but also calculate the path and pre-setup the backup
   Inter-AS LSPs that will be used if primary LSP fails.

   As per the Figure 4, LSP1 from R1 to R3 goes via ASBR1 and ASBR3, and
   it is the primary Inter-AS LSP.  R1-R3 LSP2 that go via ASBR5 and
   ASBR6 is the backup one.  In addition there could also be a bypass
   LSP setup to protect against ASBR or inter-AS link failure.

   After the addition of PCECC functionality to PCE (SDN controller),
   PCECC based Inter-AS TE model SHOULD follow as PCECC usecase for TE
   LSP as requirements of [RFC5376] with the following details:

   *  Since PCECC needs to know the topology of both domains AS1 and
      AS2, PCECC could use BGP-LS peering with routers (or RRs) in both
      domains.

   *  PCECC needs to PCEP connectivity towards all routers in both
      domains (see also section 4 in [RFC5376]) in a similar manner as a
      SDN controller.

   *  After operator's application or service orchestrator will create
      request for tunnel creation of specific service, PCECC should
      receive that request via NBI (NBI type is implementation
      dependent, could be NETCONF/Yang, REST etc.).  Then PCECC would
      calculate the optimal path based on Objective Function (OF) and
      given constraints (i.e. path setup type, bandwidth etc.),
      including those from [RFC5376]: priority, AS sequence, preferred
      ASBR, disjoint paths, protection.  On this step we would have two
      paths: R1-ASBR1-ASBR3-R3, R1-ASBR5-ASBR6-R3

   *  Depending on given LSP PST (PCECC or PCECC-SR), PCECC would use
      central control download instructions to the PCC.  At this stage
      it is assumed the PCECC is aware of the label space it controls
      and in case of SR the SID allocation and distribution is already
      done.

   *  PCECC would send PCInitiate message [RFC8281] towards ingress
      router R1 (PCC) in AS1 and receives PCRpt PCEP message [RFC8231]
      back from PCC.  If the PST is PCECC-SR, the PCECC would include
      the SID stack as per [RFC8664].  It may also include binding SID
      based on AS boundary.  The backup SID stack could also be
      installed at ingress but more importantly each node along the SR

      path could also do local protection just based on the top segment.
      If the PST is PCECC (basic), then the PCECC would assigns labels
      along the calculated paths (R1-ASBR1-ASBR3-R3, R1-ASBR5-ASBR6-R3);
      and set up the path by sending central controller instructions in
      PCEP message to each node along the path of the LSPs as per
      [RFC9050] and then send PCUpd message to the ingress R1 router
      with information about new LSPs and R1 would respond with PCRpt
      with LSP(s) status.

   *  After that step R1 now have primary and backup TEs (LSP1 and LSP2)
      towards R3.  It is up to router implementation how to make
      switchover to backup LSP2 if LSP1 fails.

3.4.  Use Cases of PCECC for Multicast LSPs

   The multicast LSPs can be setup via the RSVP-TE P2MP or mLDP
   protocols.  The setup of these LSPs may require manual configurations
   and complex signaling when the protection is considered.  By using
   the PCECC solution, the multicast LSP can be computed and setup
   through centralized controller which has the full picture of the
   topology and bandwidth usage for each link.  It not only reduces the
   complex configurations comparing the distributed RSVP-TE P2MP or mLDP
   signaling, but also it can compute the disjoint primary path and
   secondary P2MP path efficiently.

3.4.1.  Using PCECC for P2MP/MP2MP LSPs' Setup

   It is assumed the PCECC is aware of the label space it controls for
   all nodes and make allocations accordingly.

                        +-----------+

   The P2MP examples are explained here, where R1 is root and R8 and R6
   are the leaves.

   *  Based on the P2MP path computation request / delegation or PCE
      initiation, the PCECC receives the PCECC request with constraints
      and optimization criteria.

   *  PCECC would calculate the optimal P2MP path according to given
      constrains (i.e.bandwidth).

   *  PCECC would provision each node along the path and assign incoming
      and outgoing labels from R1 to {R6, R8} with the path: {R1, 6000},
      {6000, R2, {9001,9002}}, {9001, R4, 9003}, {9002, R5, 9004} {9003,
      R3, 9005}, {9004, R6}, {9005, R8}. The main difference is in the
      branch node instruction at R2 where two copies of packet are sent
      towards R4 and R5 with 9001 and 9002 labels respectively.

   The packet forwarding involves -

      Step 1: R1 may send a packet P1 to R2 simply by pushing an label
      of 6000 to the packet.

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                       March 2022


      Step 2: After R2 receives the packet with label 6000, it will
      forwarding to R4 by swapping label to 9001 and by swapping label
      of 9002 towards R5.

      Step 3: After R4 receives the packet with label 9001, it will
      forwarding to R3 by swapping to 9003.  After R5 receives the
      packet with label 9002, it will forwarding to R6 by swapping to
      9004.

      Step 4: After R3 receives the packet with label 9003, it will
      forwarding to R8 by swapping to 9005 and when R5 receives the
      packet with label 9004, it will swap to 9004 and send to R6.

      Step 5: Packet received at R8 and 9005 is popped; packet receives
      at R6 and 9004 is popped.

3.4.2.  Use Cases of PCECC for the Resiliency of P2MP/MP2MP LSPs

3.4.2.1.  PCECC for the End-to-End Protection of the P2MP/MP2MP LSPs

   In this section we describe the end-to-end managed path protection
   service as well as the local protection with the operation management
   in the PCECC network for the P2MP/MP2MP LSP.

   An end-to-end protection principle can be applied for computing
   backup P2MP or MP2MP LSPs.  During computation of the primary
   multicast trees, PCECC server may also take the computation of a
   secondary tree into consideration.  A PCE may compute the primary and
   backup P2MP (or MP2MP) LSP together or sequentially.

   In the example above, when the PCECC setup the primary multicast tree
   from the root node R1 to the leaves, which is R1->R2->{R4, R5}, at
   same time, it can setup the backup tree, which is R1->R11->R3->{R4,
   R5}.  Both the these two primary forwarding tree and secondary
   forwarding tree will be downloaded to each routers along the primary
   path and the secondary path.  The traffic will be forwarded through
   the R1->R2->{R4, R5} path normally, and when there is a node in the
   primary tree fails (say R2), then the root node R1 will switch the
   flow to the backup tree, which is R1->R11->R3->{R4, R5}.  By using
   the PCECC, the path computation and forwarding path downloading can
   all be done without the complex signaling used in the P2MP RSVP-TE or
   mLDP.

3.4.2.2.  PCECC for the Local Protection of the P2MP/MP2MP LSPs

   In this section we describe the local protection service in the PCECC
   network for the P2MP/MP2MP LSP.

   While the PCECC sets up the primary multicast tree, it can also build
   the back LSP among PLR, the protected node, and MPs (the downstream
   nodes of the protected node).  In the cases where the amount of
   downstream nodes are huge, this mechanism can avoid unnecessary
   packet duplication on PLR and protect the network from traffic
   congestion risk.

                             .                  .

   In the example above, when the PCECC setup the primary multicast path
   around the PLR node R10 to protect node R20, which is R10->R20->{R40,
   R50}, at same time, it can setup the backup path R10->R30->{R40,
   R50}.  Both the these two primary forwarding path and secondary
   bypass forwarding path will be downloaded to each routers along the
   primary path and the secondary bypass path.  The traffic will be
   forwarded through the R10->R20->{R40, R50} path normally, and when
   there is a node failure for node R20, then the PLR node R10 will
   switch the flow to the backup path, which is R10->R30->{R40, R50}.
   By using the PCECC, the path computation and forwarding path
   downloading can all be done without the complex signaling used in the
   P2MP RSVP-TE or mLDP.

3.5.  Using PCECC for Traffic Classification Information

   As described in [RFC8283], traffic classification is an important
   part of traffic engineering.  It is the process of looking at a
   packet to determine how it should be treated as it is forwarded
   through the network.  It applies in many scenarios including MPLS
   traffic engineering (where it determines what traffic is forwarded
   onto which LSPs); segment routing (where it is used to select which

   set of forwarding instructions to add to a packet); and SFC (where it
   indicates along which service function path a packet should be
   forwarded).  In conjunction with traffic engineering, traffic
   classification is an important enabler for load balancing.  Traffic
   classification is closely linked to the computational elements of
   planning for the network functions just listed because it determines
   how traffic load is balanced and distributed through the network.
   Therefore, selecting what traffic classification should be performed
   by a router is an important part of the work done by a PCECC.

   Instructions can be passed from the controller to the routers using
   PCEP.  These instructions tell the routers how to map traffic to
   paths or connections.  Refer [RFC9168].

   Along with traffic classification, there are few more question that
   needs to be considered once the path is setup -

   *  how to use it

   *  Whether it is a virtual link

   *  Whether to advertise it in the IGP as a virtual link

   *  What bits of this information to signal to the tail end

   These are out of scope of this document.

3.6.  Use Cases of PCECC for SRv6

   As per [RFC8402], with Segment Routing (SR), a node steers a packet
   through an ordered list of instructions, called segments.  Segment
   Routing can be applied to the IPv6 architecture with the Segment
   Routing Header (SRH) [RFC8754].  A segment is encoded as an IPv6
   address.  An ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered list
   of IPv6 addresses in the routing header.  The active segment is
   indicated by the Destination Address of the packet.  Upon completion
   of a segment, a pointer in the new routing header is incremented and
   indicates the next segment.

   As per [RFC8754], an SRv6 Segment is a 128-bit value.  "SRv6 SID" or
   simply "SID" are often used as a shorter reference for "SRv6
   Segment".  Further details are in An illustration is provided in
   [RFC8986] where SRv6 SID is represented as LOC:FUNCT.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-ipv6] extends [RFC8664] to support SR
   for IPv6 data plane.  Further a PCECC could be extended to support
   SRv6 SID allocation and distribution.

   In this case, PCECC could assign the SRv6 SID (in form of a IPv6
   address) to be used for node and adjacency.  Later SRv6 path in form
   of list of SRv6 SID could be used at the ingress.  Some examples -

   *  SRv6 SID-List={2001:db8::8} - The best path towards R8

   *  SRv6 SID-List={2001:db8::5, 2001:db8::8} - The path towards R8 via
      R5

3.7.  Use Cases of PCECC for SFC

   Service Function Chaining (SFC) is described in [RFC7665].  It is the
   process of directing traffic in a network such that it passes through
   specific hardware devices or virtual machines (known as service
   function nodes) that can perform particular desired functions on the
   traffic.  The set of functions to be performed and the order in which
   they are to be performed is known as a service function chain.  The
   chain is enhanced with the locations at which the service functions
   are to be performed to derive a Service Function Path (SFP).  Each
   packet is marked as belonging to a specific SFP, and that marking
   lets each successive service function node know which functions to
   perform and to which service function node to send the packet next.

   To operate an SFC network, the service function nodes must be
   configured to understand the packet markings, and the edge nodes must
   be told how to mark packets entering the network.  Additionally, it
   may be necessary to establish tunnels between service function nodes
   to carry the traffic.  Planning an SFC network requires load
   balancing between service function nodes and traffic engineering
   across the network that connects them.  As per [RFC8283], these are
   operations that can be performed by a PCE-based controller, and that
   controller can use PCEP to program the network and install the
   service function chains and any required tunnels.

   A possible mechanism would be to add support for SFC based central
   control instruction that would be able to instruct the following to
   the each SFF along the SFP -

   *  Service Path Identifier (SPI): Uniquely identifies a SFP.

   *  Service Index (SI): Provides location within the SFP.

   *  SFC Proxy handling

   PCECC can play the role for setting the traffic classification rules
   at the classifier to impose the NSH as well as downloading the
   forwarding instructions to each SFFs along the way so that they could
   process the NSH and forward accordingly.  Instructions to the service
   classifier handle the context header, meta data etc.

   It is also possible to support SFC with SR in conjunction with or
   without NSH such as [I-D.ietf-spring-nsh-sr] and
   [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-service-programming].  PCECC technique can also
   be used for service function related segments and SR service
   policies.

3.8.  Use Cases of PCECC for Native IP

   [RFC8735] describes the scenarios, and suggestions for the "Centrally
   Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR)" architecture, which integrates the
   merit of traditional distributed protocols (IGP/BGP), and the power
   of centrally control technologies (PCE/SDN) to provide one feasible
   traffic engineering solution in various complex scenarios for the
   service provider.  [RFC8821] defines the framework for CCDR traffic
   engineering within Native IP network, using Dual/Multi-BGP session
   strategy and CCDR architecture.  PCEP protocol can be used to
   transfer the key parameters between PCE and the underlying network
   devices (PCC) using PCECC technique.  The central control
   instructions from PCECC to identify which prefix should be advertised
   on which BGP session.

3.9.  Use Cases of PCECC for BIER

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [RFC8279] defines an
   architecture where all intended multicast receivers are encoded as a
   bitmask in the multicast packet header within different
   encapsulations.  A router that receives such a packet will forward
   the packet based on the bit position in the packet header towards the
   receiver(s) following a precomputed tree for each of the bits in the
   packet.  Each receiver is represented by a unique bit in the bitmask.

   BIER-TE [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch] shares architecture and packet
   formats with BIER.  BIER-TE forwards and replicates packets based on
   a BitString in the packet header, but every BitPosition of the
   BitString of a BIER-TE packet indicates one or more adjacencies.
   BIER-TE Path can be derived from a PCE and used at the ingress as
   described in [I-D.chen-pce-bier].

   Further, PCECC mechanism could be used for the allocation of bits for
   the BIER router for BIER as well as for the adjacencies for BIER-TE.
   PCECC based controller can use PCEP to instruct the BIER capable
   routers the meaning of the bits as well as other fields needed for
   BIER encapsulation.  The PCECC could be used to program the BIER
   router with various parameters used in the BIER encapsulation such as
   BIER subdomain-ID, BFR-ID, BIER Encapsulation etc etc for both node
   and adjacency.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action from IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   [RFC8283] describes how the security considerations for a PCE-based
   controller are little different from those for any other PCE system.
   That is, the operation relies heavily on the use and security of
   PCEP, so due consideration should be given to the security features
   discussed in [RFC5440] and the additional mechanisms described in
   [RFC8253].  It further lists the vulnerability of a central
   controller architecture, such as a central point of failure, denial
   of service, and a focus for interception and modification of messages
   sent to individual Network Elements (NEs).










Li, et al.              Expires 8 September 2022               [Page 26]

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                       March 2022


   As per [RFC9050], the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) in PCEP
   is recommended, as it provides support for peer authentication,
   message encryption, and integrity.  It further provides mechanisms
   for associating peer identities with different levels of access and/
   or authoritativeness via an attribute in X.509 certificates or a
   local policy with a specific accept-list of X.509 certificates.  This
   can be used to check the authority for the PCECC operations.

   It is expected that each new document that is produced for a specific
   use case will also include considerations of the security impacts of
   the use of a PCE-based central controller on the network type and
   services being managed.

Appendix A.  Other Use Cases of PCECC

   This section list some more advanced use cases of PCECC that were
   discussed and could be worked on in future.

A.1.  Use Cases of PCECC for LSP in the Network Migration

   One of the main advantages for PCECC solution is that it has backward
   compatibility naturally since the PCE server itself can function as a
   proxy node of MPLS network for all the new nodes which may no longer
   support the signaling protocols.

   As it is illustrated in the following example, the current network
   could migrate to a total PCECC controlled network gradually by
   replacing the legacy nodes.  During the migration, the legacy nodes
   still need to signal using the existing MPLS protocol such as LDP and
   RSVP-TE, and the new nodes setup their portion of the forwarding path
   through PCECC directly.  With the PCECC function as the proxy of
   these new nodes, MPLS signaling can populate through network as
   normal.

   Example described in this section is based on network configurations
   illustrated using the following figure:

   +------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Example: PCECC Initiated LSP Setup In the Network Migration

   In this example, there are five nodes for the TE LSP from head end
   (Node1) to the tail end (Node5).  Where the Node4 and Node5 are
   centrally controlled and other nodes are legacy nodes.

   *  Node1 sends a path request message for the setup of LSP
      destinating to Node5.

   *  PCECC sends to node1 a reply message for LSP setup with the path:
      (Node1, if1),(Node2, if2), (Node3, if3), (Node4, if4), Node5.

   *  Node1, Node2, Node3 will setup the LSP to Node5 using the local
      labels as usual.  Node 3 with help of PCECC could proxy the
      signaling.

   *  Then the PCECC will program the out-segment of Node3, the in-
      segment/ out-segment of Node4, and the in-segment for Node5.

A.2.  Use Cases of PCECC for L3VPN and PWE3

   As described in [RFC8283], various network services may be offered
   over a network.  These include protection services (including Virtual
   Private Network (VPN) services (such as Layer 3 VPNs [RFC4364] or
   Ethernet VPNs [RFC7432]); or Pseudowires [RFC3985].  Delivering
   services over a network in an optimal way requires coordination in
   the way that network resources are allocated to support the services.
   A PCE-based central controller can consider the whole network and all
   components of a service at once when planning how to deliver the
   service.  It can then use PCEP to manage the network resources and to
   install the necessary associations between those resources.

   In the case of L3VPN, VPN labels can be assigned and distributed
   through the PCECC PCEP among the PE router instead of using the BGP
   protocols.

   Example described in this section is based on network configurations
   illustrated using the following figure:

               +-------------------------------------------+

   Example: Using PCECC for L3VPN and PWE3

   In the case PWE3, instead of using the LDP signaling protocols, the
   label and port pairs assigned to each pseudowire can be assigned
   through PCECC among the PE routers and the corresponding forwarding
   entries will be distributed into each PE routers through the extended
   PCEP protocols and PCECC mechanism.

A.3.  Use Cases of PCECC for Local Protection (RSVP-TE)

   [I-D.cbrt-pce-stateful-local-protection] describes the need for the
   PCE to maintain and associate the local protection paths for the
   RSVP-TE LSP.  Local protection requires the setup of a bypass at the
   PLR.  This bypass can be PCC-initiated and delegated, or PCE-
   initiated.  In either case, the PLR MUST maintain a PCEP session to
   the PCE.  The Bypass LSPs need to mapped to the primary LSP.  This
   could be done locally at the PLR based on a local policy but there is
   a need for a PCE to do the mapping as well to exert greater control.

   This mapping can be done via PCECC procedures where the PCE could
   instruct the PLR to the mapping and identify the primary LSP for
   which bypass should be used.

A.4.  Using reliable P2MP TE based multicast delivery for distributed
      computations (MapReduce-Hadoop)

   MapReduce model of distributed computations in computing clusters is
   widely deployed.  In Hadoop (https://hadoop.apache.org/) 1.0
   architecture MapReduce operations on big data in the Hadoop
   Distributed File System (HDFS), where NameNode has the knowledge
   about resources of the cluster and where actual data (chunks) for
   particular task are located (which DataNode).  Each chunk of data
   (64MB or more) should have 3 saved copies in different DataNodes
   based on their proximity.

   Proximity level currently has semi-manual allocation and based on
   Rack IDs (Assumption is that closer data are better because of access
   speed/smaller latency).

   JobTracker node is responsible for computation tasks, scheduling
   across DataNodes and also have Rack-awareness.  Currently transport
   protocols between NameNode/JobTracker and DataNodes are based on IP
   unicast.  It has simplicity as pros but has numerous drawbacks
   related with its flat approach.

   It is clear that we should go beyond of one DC for Hadoop cluster
   creation and move towards distributed clusters.  In that case we need
   to handle performance and latency issues.  Latency depends on speed
   of light in fiber links and also latency introduced by intermediate
   devices in between.  The last one is closely correlated with network
   device architecture and performance.  Current performance of NPU
   based routers should be enough for creating distribute Hadoop
   clusters with predicted latency.  Performance of SW based routers
   (mainly as VNF) together with additional HW features such as DPDK are
   promising but require additional research and testing.

   Main question is how can we create simple but effective architecture
   for distributed Hadoop cluster?

   There is research [MAP-REDUCE] which show how usage of multicast tree
   could improve speed of resource or cluster members discovery inside
   the cluster as well as increase redundancy in communications between
   cluster nodes.

   Is traditional IP based multicast enough for that?  We doubt it
   because it requires additional control plane (IGMP, PIM) and a lot of
   signaling, that is not suitable for high performance computations,
   that are very sensitive to latency.

   P2MP TE tunnels looks much more suitable as potential solution for
   creation of multicast based communications between NameNode as root
   and DataNodes as leaves inside the cluster.  Obviously these P2MP
   tunnels should be dynamically created and turned down (no manual
   intervention).  Here, the PCECC comes to play with main objective to
   create optimal topology of each particular request for MapReduce
   computation and also create P2MP tunnels with needed parameters such
   as bandwidth and delay.

   This solution would require to use MPLS label based forwarding inside
   the cluster.  Usage of label based forwarding inside DC was proposed
   by Yandex [MPLS-DC].  Technically it is already possible because MPLS
   on switches is already supported by some vendors, MPLS also exists on
   Linux and OVS.

   The following framework can make this task:

                      |  APP   |

   | Job Tracker |        |   | |  |           | NameNode |
   |             |        |   | |  |           |          |

           +------------------+ |  +-----------+
           |              |     |              |

   |TaskTraker|       |TaskTraker| .... |TaskTraker|
   +----------+       +----------+      +----------+

   Communication between JobTracker, NameNode and PCECC can be done via
   REST API directly or via cluster manager such as Mesos.

   Phase 1: Distributed cluster resources discovery During this phase
   JobTracker and NameNode SHOULD identify and find available DataNodes
   according to computing request from application (APP).  NameNode
   SHOULD query PCECC about available DataNodes, NameNode MAY provide
   additional constrains to PCECC such as topological proximity,
   redundancy level.

   PCECC SHOULD analyze the topology of distributed cluster and perform
   constrain based path calculation from client towards most suitable
   NameNodes.  PCECC SHOULD reply to NameNode the list of most suitable
   DataNodes and their resource capabilities.  Topology discovery
   mechanism for PCECC will be added later to that framework.

   Phase 2: PCECC SHOULD create P2MP LSP from client towards those
   DataNodes by means of PCEP messages following previously calculated
   path.

   Phase 3.  NameNode SHOULD send this information to client, PCECC
   informs client about optimal P2MP path towards DataNodes via PCEP
   message.

   Phase 4.  Client sends data blocks to those DataNodes for writing via
   created P2MP tunnel.

   When this task will be finished, P2MP tunnel could be turned down.
