Abstract

   This document describes the LDAP service type. This service type
   defines the service: URL and attributes necessary for discovering
   LDAP servers.

1. Introduction

   This document describes a template providing a service: URL and
   attributes useful for dynamically discovering LDAP servers; this type
   can be used with SLP [1]. Service templates and service: schemes are
   defined in [2].

   LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) [3] directories are
   now being used as repositories for UNIX-style system information.

   As such, LDAP service is suitable to be included in the naming-
   directory class. This type is intended to be used as a concrete
   portion of the abstract naming-directory type defined in [4]. The
   LDAP type includes all attributes from the naming-directory abstract
   type, and defines three new attributes, two pertaining to LDAP
   security, one to access protocols.

   For usage examples, refer to [4].

2. The LDAP Service Type

Names of submitters: Jonathan Wood <jonathan.wood@eng.sun.com>
                     Roberto Tam <roberto.tam@eng.sun.com>
Language of service template: en
Security Considerations:
  This LDAP service type inherits the security considerations from the
  naming-directory service type [4].

Template text:
-------------------------template begins here-----------------------
template-type=naming-directory:ldap

template-version=0.0

template-description=
  This is a concrete type; the abstract type for this service
  is naming-directory (described in [4]). This type is used
  by LDAP servers to advertise their services and LDAP clients
  which wish to discover LDAP servers.

template-url=syntax=
  url-path = ldap URL as defined in [5]

security= string M
  # security mechanisms supported by this server.
none,simple,TLS,kerb5,sasl

qop= string
  # quality of protection. The refers to how strongly messages are
  # protected. There are three possibilities: none, integrity
  # (meaning that the integrity and endpoints of the message can
  # be guaranteed), and privacy (meaning that the message is
  # encrypted).
none,integrity,privacy

transport= string
  # the transport used to communicate with this server. Possible
  # values are connection-oriented (cots) and connectionless
