pro =  Does not need to change anything in the PIM protocol.

con =  Imposes additional costs in operation, and/or restricts
      operational flexibility.
pro =  Does not increase operational cost.  Keeps flexibility of
      configuration.

con =  Requires a change (an extension) in the PIM protocol, and
      increases implementation cost.
pro =  Does not increase operational cost.  Keeps flexibility of
      configuration.

con =  May require additional implementation cost.

con =  May require additional consideration (and implementation costs
      as a result) for corner cases or to ensure consistency.


pro =  Does not increase operational cost.  Keeps flexibility of
      configuration.

con =  Requires a change in the PIM protocol

con =  Not a complete solution.  It would hinder the optimization by
      Generation ID.
