Abstract 
    
   This document describes the representation of session authorization 
   information in the POLICY_DATA object (RFC 2750) for supporting 
   policy-based per-session authorization and admission control in 
   RSVP.  The goal of session authorization is to allow the exchange of 
   information between network elements in order to authorize the use 
   of resources for a service and to co-ordinate actions between the 
   signaling and transport planes.  This document describes how a 
   process on a system authorizes the reservation of resources by a 
   host and then provides that host with a session authorization policy 
   element which can be inserted into the RSVP PATH message to 
   facilitate proper and secure reservation of those resources within 
   the network. We describe the encoding of media authorization 
   information as RSVP policy elements and provide details relating to 
   operations, processing rules and error scenarios.

Internet Draft         Session Authorization for RSVP          June 2002 
                                     
 
1. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119]. 
    
2. Introduction 
    
   RSVP [RFC-2205] is a resource reservation setup protocol designed 
   for an integrated services [RFC-1633] or Integrated Services over 
   Diffserv networks [RFC-2998]. The RSVP protocol is used by a host to 
   request specific services from the network for particular 
   application data streams or flows.  RSVP is also used to deliver 
   quality-of-service (QoS) requests to all routers along the path(s) 
   of the flows and to establish and maintain state to provide the 
   requested quality of service.  RSVP requests will generally result 
   in resources being reserved in each router along the data path.  
   RSVP allows users to obtain preferential access to network 
   resources, under the control of an admission control mechanism.  
   Such admission control is often based on user or application 
   identity [RFC-3182], however, it is also valuable to provide the 
   ability for per-session admission control. 
    
   In order to allow for per-session admission control, it is necessary 
   to provide a mechanism for ensuring use of resources by a host has 
   been properly authorized before allowing the reservation of those 
   resources.  In order to meet this requirement, there must be 
   information in the RSVP message which may be used to verify the 
   validity of the RSVP request.  This can be done by providing the 
   host with a token upon authorization which is inserted into the RSVP 
   PATH message and verified by the network. 
    
   This document describes the session authorization element 
   (AUTH_SESSION) contained in the POLICY_DATA object.  The user 
   process must obtain an AUTH_SESSION object from an authorizing 
   entity, which it then passes to the RSVP process (service) on the 
   originating host.  The RSVP service then inserts the AUTH_SESSION 
   object into the RSVP PATH message to allow verification of the 
   network resource request. Network elements verify the request and 
   then process the RSVP message based on admission policy. 
    
   [S-AUTH] describes a framework in which a session authorization 
   policy element may be utilized to contain information relevant to 
   the network's decision to grant a reservation request. 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


Internet Draft         Session Authorization for RSVP          June 2002 
                                     
 
3. Policy Element for Session Authorization Data 
    
3.1 Policy Data Object Format 
    
   POLICY_DATA objects contain policy information and are carried by 
   RSVP messages. A detailed description of the format of POLICY_DATA 
   object can be found in "RSVP Extensions for Policy Control" [RFC-
   2750]. 
    
3.2 Session Authorization Data Policy Element 
    
   In this section we describe a policy element (PE) called session 
   authorization data (AUTH_SESSION).  The AUTH_SESSION policy element 
   contains a list of fields which describe the session, along with 
   other attributes. 
    
          +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ 
          | Length                    | P-Type = AUTH_SESSION     | 
          +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ 
          // Session Authorization Attribute List                // 
          +-------------------------------------------------------+ 
       
   Length: 16 bits  
      The length of the policy element (including the Length and 
      P-Type) is in number of octets (MUST be in multiples of 4) and 
      indicates the end of the session authorization information block. 
    
   P-Type: 16 bits (Session Authorization Type) 
      AUTH_SESSION = TBD-by-IANA 
      The Policy element type (P-type) of this element.  The 
      Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) acts as a registry 
      for policy element types for identity as described in 
      [RFC-2750].   
    
   Session Authorization Attribute List: variable length 
      The session authorization attribute list is a collection of 
      objects which describes the session and provides other 
      information necessary to verify the RSVP request. An initial set 
      of valid objects is described in Section 3. 
    
3.3 Session Authorization Attributes 
    
   A session authorization attribute may contain a variety of 
   information and has both an attribute type and subtype.  The 
   attribute itself MUST be a multiple of 4 octets in length, and any 
   attributes that are not a multiple of 4 octets long MUST be padded 
   to a 4-octet boundary. All padding bytes MUST have a value of zero.

      +--------+--------+--------+--------+ 
      | Value ... 
      +--------+--------+--------+--------+ 
    
    
   Length: 16 bits 
        The length field is two octets and indicates the actual length 
        of the attribute (including Length, S-Type and SubType fields)  
        in number of octets.  The length does NOT include any bytes  
        padding to the value field to make the attribute a multiple of  
        4 octets long.  
    
   S-Type: 8 bits 
        Session authorization attribute type (S-Type) field is one 
        octet.  IANA acts as a registry for S-Types as described 
        in section 7, IANA Considerations.  Initially, the registry 
        contains the following S-Types: 
    
        1  AUTH_ENT_ID          The unique identifier of the entity 
                                which authorized the session. 
                                        
        2  SESSION_ID           Unique identifier for this session. 
    
        3  SOURCE_ADDR          Address specification for the 
                                session originator. 
    
        4  DEST_ADDR            Address specification for the 
                                session end-point. 
    
        5  START_TIME           The starting time for the session. 
    
        6  END_TIME             The end time for the session. 
    
        7  RESOURCES            The resources which the user is 
                                authorized to request. 
    
        8  AUTHENTICATION_DATA  Authentication data of the session 
                                authorization policy element. 
    
   SubType: 8 bits    
        Session authorization attribute sub-type is one octet in 
        length.  The value of the SubType depends on the S-Type. 
    
   Value: variable length 
        The attribute specific information.

3.3.1 Authorizing Entity Identifier 
    
   AUTH_ENT_ID is used to identify the entity which authorized the 
   initial service request and generated the session authorization 
   policy element.  The AUTH_ENT_ID may be represented in various 
   formats, and the SubType is used to define the format for the ID. 
   The format for AUTH_ENT_ID is as follows: 
    
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+ 
      | Length        |S-Type |SubType| 
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+ 
      | OctetString ... 
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+ 
    
   Length  
      Length of the attribute, which MUST be > 4. 
    
   S-Type 
      AUTH_ENT_ID 
    
   SubType 
      The following sub-types for AUTH_ENT_ID are defined.  IANA 
      acts as a registry for AUTH_ENT_ID sub-types as described 
      in section 7, IANA Considerations.  Initially, the registry 
      contains the following sub-types of AUTH_ENT_ID: 
    
      1  IPV4_ADDRESS        IPv4 address represented in 32 bits 
    
      2  IPV6_ADDRESS        IPv6 address represented in 128 bits 
    
      3  FQDN                Fully Qualified Domain Name as defined 
                             in RFC-1034 as an ASCII string. 
    
      4  ASCII_DN            X.500 Distinguished name as defined  
                             in RFC-2253 as an ASCII string. 
    
      5  UNICODE_DN          X.500 Distinguished name as defined  
                             in RFC-2253 as a UNICODE string. 
            
      6  URI                 Universal Resource Identifier, as  
                             defined in RFC-2396. 
    
      7  KRB_PRINCIPAL      Fully Qualified Kerberos Principal name 
                            represented by the ASCII string of a 
                            principal followed by the @ realm name as 
                            defined in RFC-1510 (e.g. 
                            principalX@realmY). 
    
      8  X509_V3_CERT        A chain of authorizing entity's X.509 V3  
                             digital certificates.

      9  PGP_CERT            The PGP digital certificate of the 
                             authorizing entity. 
    
    
   OctetString 
      Contains the authorizing entity identifier. 
    
3.3.2 Session Identifier 
    
   SESSION_ID is a unique identifier used by the authorizing entity to 
   identify the request.  It may be used for a number of purposes, 
   including replay detection, or to correlate this request to a policy 
   decision entry made by the authorizing entity. For example, the 
   SESSION_ID can be based on simple sequence number or on a standard 
   NTP timestamp.  
    
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+ 
      | Length        |S-Type |SubType| 
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+ 
      | OctetString ... 
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+ 
    
   Length 
      Length of the attribute, which MUST be > 4. 
          
       
   S-Type 
      SESSION_ID 
    
   SubType 
      No subtypes for SESSION ID are currently defined; this field MUST 
   be set to zero. The authorizing entity is the only network entity 
   that needs to interpret the contents of the SESSION ID therefore the 
   contents and format are implementation dependent. 
    
   OctetString 
      Contains the session identifier. 
    
3.3.3 Source Address 
    
   SOURCE_ADDR is used to identify the source address specification of 
   the authorized session. This S-Type may be useful in some scenarios 
   to make sure the resource request has been authorized for that 
   particular source address and/or port. 
    
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+

   S-Type 
      SOURCE_ADDR 
    
   SubType 
      The following sub types for SOURCE_ADDR are defined. IANA 
      acts as a registry for SOURCE_ADDR sub-types as 
      described in section 7, IANA Considerations. Initially, the 
      registry contains the following sub types for SOURCE_ADDR: 
    
      1  IPV4_ADDRESS        IPv4 address represented in 32 bits 
    
      2  IPV6_ADDRESS        IPv6 address represented in 128 bits 
    
      3  FQDN                Fully Qualified Domain Name as defined 
                             in RFC-1034 as an ASCII string. 
    
      4  ASCII_DN            X.500 Distinguished name as defined  
                             in RFC-2253 as an ASCII string. 
    
      5  UNICODE_DN          X.500 Distinguished name as defined  
                             in RFC-2253 as a UNICODE string. 
    
      6  UDP_PORT LIST       list of UDP port specifications, 
                             represented as 16 bits per list entry. 
            
      7  TCP_PORT LIST       list of TCP port specifications, 
                             represented as 16 bits per list entry. 
    
   OctetString 
      The OctetString contains the source address information. 
    
   In scenarios where a source address is required (see Section 5), at 
   least one of the subtypes 1 through 5 (inclusive) MUST be included 
   in every Session Authorization Data Policy Element. Multiple SOURCE 
   ADDR attributes MAY be included if multiple addresses have been 
   authorized. The source address field of the RSVP datagram MUST match 
   one of the SOURCE ADDR attributes contained in this Session 
   Authorization Data Policy Element when resolved to an IP address. 
    
   At most, one instance of subtype 6 MAY be included in every Session 
   Authorization Data Policy Element. At most, one instance of subtype 
   7 MAY be included in every Session Authorization Data Policy 
   Element. Inclusion of a subtype 6 attribute does not prevent 
   inclusion of a subtype 7 attribute (i.e. both UDP and TCP ports may 
   be authorized). 
    
   If no PORT attributes are specified, then all ports are considered 
   valid; otherwise, only the specified ports are authorized for use.

   Every source address and port list must be included in a separate 
   SOURCE_ADDR attribute. 
    
3.3.4 Destination Address 
    
   DEST_ADDR is used to identify the destination address of the 
   authorized session. This S-Type may be useful in some scenarios to 
   make sure the resource request has been authorized for that 
   particular destination address and/or port.

                             in RFC-2253 as an ASCII string. 
    
      5  UNICODE_DN          X.500 Distinguished name as defined  
                             in RFC-2253 as a UNICODE string. 
    
      6  UDP_PORT LIST       list of UDP port specifications, 
                             represented as 16 bits per list entry.  
            
      7  TCP_PORT LIST       list of TCP port specifications, 
                             represented as 16 bits per list entry. 
    
   OctetString 
      The OctetString contains the destination address specification.

   In scenarios where a destination address is required (see Section 
   5), at least one of the subtypes 1 through 5 (inclusive) MUST be 
   included in every Session Authorization Data Policy Element. 
   Multiple DEST ADDR attributes MAY be included if multiple addresses 
   have been authorized. The destination address field of the RSVP 
   datagram MUST match one of the DEST ADDR attributes contained in 
   this Session Authorization Data Policy Element when resolved to an 
   IP address. 
    
   At most, one instance of subtype 6 MAY be included in every Session 
   Authorization Data Policy Element. At most, one instance of subtype 
   7 MAY be included in every Session Authorization Data Policy 
   Element. Inclusion of a subtype 6 attribute does not prevent 
   inclusion of a subtype 7 attribute (i.e. both UDP and TCP ports may 
   be authorized). 
    
   If no PORT attributes are specified, then all ports are considered 
   valid; otherwise, only the specified ports are authorized for use. 
 
   Every destination address and port list must be included in a 
   separate DEST_ADDR attribute. 
    
    
3.3.5 Start time 
    
   START_TIME is used to identify the start time of the authorized 
   Session and can be used to prevent replay attacks. If the 
   AUTH_SESSION policy element is presented in a resource request, the 
   network SHOULD reject the request if it is not received within a few 
   seconds of the start time specified.

      contains the following sub types for START_TIME: 
      1  NTP_TIMESTAMP        NTP Timestamp Format as defined in  
                              RFC-1305.

   OctetString 
      The OctetString contains the start time. 
    
3.3.6 End time 
    
   END_TIME is used to identify the end time of the authorized 
   session and can be used to limit the amount of time that resources 
   are authorized for use (e.g. in prepaid session scenarios).

      RESOURCES 
    
   SubType 
      The following sub-types for RESOURCES are defined. IANA  
      acts as a registry for RESOURCES sub-types as described in 
      section 7, IANA Considerations. Initially, the registry 
      contains the following sub types for RESOURCES: 
    
      1  BANDWIDTH     Maximum bandwidth (kbps) authorized. 
    
      2  FLOW_SPEC     Flow spec specification as defined in 
                       RFC-2205. 
    
      3  SDP           SDP Media Descriptor as defined in  
                       RFC-2327. 
    
      4  DSCP          Differentiated services codepoint as  
                       defined in RFC-2474.             
    
   OctetString 
      The OctetString contains the resources specification. 
    
   In scenarios where a resource specification is required (see Section 
   5), at least one of the subtypes 1 through 4 (inclusive) MUST be 
   included in every Session Authorization Data Policy Element. 
   Multiple RESOURCE attributes MAY be included if multiple types of 
   resources have been authorized (e.g. DSCP and BANDWIDTH). 
    
    
3.3.8 Authentication data 
    
   The AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute contains the authentication data 
   of the AUTH_SESSION policy element and signs all the data in the 
   policy element up to the AUTHENTICATION_DATA.  If the 
   AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute has been included in the AUTH_SESSION 
   policy element, it MUST be the last attribute in the list. The 
   algorithm used to compute the authentication data depends on the 
   AUTH_ENT_ID SubType field. See Section 4 entitled Integrity of the 
   AUTH_SESSION policy element.   
    
   A summary of AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute format is described 
   below.

      OctetString contains the authentication data of the AUTH_SESSION. 
    
    
4. Integrity of the AUTH_SESSION policy element 
    
   This section describes how to ensure the integrity of the policy 
   element is preserved. 
    
4.1 Shared private keys 
    
      In shared private key environments, the AUTH_ENT_ID MUST be of 
   subtypes: IPV4_ADDR, IPV6_ADDR, FQDN, ASCII_DN, UNICODE_DN or URI.  
   An example AUTH_SESSION policy element is shown below. 
    
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | Length                      | P-type = AUTH_SESSION       | 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | Length                      |SESSION_ID    |     zero     | 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | OctetString (The session identifier) ... 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | Length                      |AUTH DATA.    |     zero     | 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | OctetString (Authentication data) ... 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
    
4.1.1 Operational Setting using shared private keys 
    
   This assumes both the Authorizing Entity and the Network router/PDP 
   are provisioned with shared private keys and with policies detailing 
   which algorithm to be used for computing the authentication data. 
    
   Key maintenance is outside the scope of this document, but 
   AUTH_SESSION implementations MUST at least provide the ability to 
   manually configure keys and their parameters locally. The key used 
   to produce the authentication data is identified by the AUTH_ENT_ID 
   field. Each key must also be configured with lifetime parameters for 
   the time period within which it is valid as well as an associated 
   cryptographic algorithm parameter specifying the algorithm to be 
   used with the key. At a minimum, all AUTH_SESSION implementations 

 


Internet Draft         Session Authorization for RSVP          June 2002 
                                     
 
   MUST support the HMAC-MD5-96 [RFC-2104][FRC-1321] cryptographic 
   algorithm for computing the authentication data. 
    
   It is good practice to regularly change keys. Keys MUST be 
   configurable such that their lifetimes overlap allowing smooth 
   transitions between keys. At the midpoint of the lifetime overlap 
   between two keys, senders should transition from using the current 
   key to the next/longer-lived key. Meanwhile, receivers simply accept 
   any identified key received within its configured lifetime and 
   reject those that are not. 
 
    
4.2 Kerberos 
    
   In a Kerberos environment, the AUTH_ENT_ID MUST be of the subtype 
   KRB_PRINCIPAL. Kerberos [RFC 1510] authentication uses a trusted 
   third party (the Kerberos Distribution Center - KDC) to provide for 
   authentication of the AUTH_SESSION to a network server.  It is 
   assumed that a KDC is present and both host and verifier of 
   authentication information (authorizing entity and router/PDP) 
   implement Kerberos authentication. 
    
   An example of the Kerberos AUTH_DATA policy element is shown below. 
    
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | Length                      | P-type = AUTH_SESSION       | 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | Length                      |SESSION_ID    |     zero     | 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | OctetString (The session identifier) ... 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | Length                      | AUTH_ENT_ID  | KERB_P.      | 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | OctetString (The principal@realm name) ... 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
    
4.2.1. Operational Setting using Kerberos 
    
      An authorizing entity is configured to construct the AUTH_SESSION 
   policy element that designates use of the Kerberos authentication 
   method (KRB_PRINCIPAL).  Upon reception of the RSVP request, the 
   router/PDP contacts the local KDC to request a ticket for the 
   authorizing entity (principal@realm). The router/PDP uses the ticket 
   to access the authorizing entity and obtain authentication data for 
   the message. 
    
   For cases where the authorizing entity is in a different realm (i.e. 
   administrative domain, organizational boundary), the router/PDP 
   needs to fetch a cross-realm Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) from its 
   local KDC. This TGT can be used to fetch authorizing entity tickets 

 


Internet Draft         Session Authorization for RSVP          June 2002 
                                     
 
   from the KDC in the remote realm. Note that for performance 
   considerations, tickets are typically cached for extended periods. 
    
    
4.3 Public Key 
    
      In a public key environment, the AUTH_ENT_ID MUST be of the 
   subtypes: X509_V3_CERT or PGP_CERT. The authentication data is used 
   for authenticating the authorizing entity.  An example of the public 
   key AUTH_SESSION policy element is shown below. 
    
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | Length                      | P-type = AUTH_SESSION       | 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | Length                      |SESSION_ID    |     zero     | 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | OctetString (The session identifier) ... 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | Length                      | AUTH_ENT_ID  |   PGP_CERT   | 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | OctetString (Authorizing entity Digital Certificate) ... 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | Length                      |AUTH DATA.    |     zero     | 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | OctetString (Authentication data) ... 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
    
4.3.1. Operational Setting for public key based authentication 
    
      Public key based authentication assumes following: 
    
         -  Authorizing entities have a pair of keys (private key and 
            public key). 
    
         -  Private key is secured with the authorizing entity. 
    
         -  Public keys are stored in digital certificates and a    
            trusted party, certificate authority (CA) issues these  
            digital certificates. 
    
         -  The verifier (PDP or router) has the ability to verify the 
            digital certificate. 
    
    
   Authorizing entity uses its private key to generate 
   AUTHENTICATION_DATA. Authenticators (router, PDP) use the 
   authorizing entity's public key (stored in the digital certificate) 
   to verify and authenticate the policy element.

5. Framework 
    
   [S-AUTH] describes a framework in which the AUTH_SESSION 
   policy element may be utilized to transport information required for  
   authorizing resource reservation for media flows. [S-AUTH] 
   introduces 4 different models:  
   1- the coupled model  
   2- the associated model with one policy server  
   3- the associated model with two policy servers  
   4- the non-associated model. 
     
   The fields that are required in an AUTH SESSION policy element is 
   dependent on which of the models is used. 
    
5.1 The coupled model 
    
   In the Coupled Model, the only information that MUST be included in 
   the policy element is the SESSION ID; it is used by the Authorizing 
   Entity to correlate the resource reservation request with the media 
   authorized during session set up. Since the End Host is assumed to 
   be untrusted, the Policy Server SHOULD take measures to ensure that 
   the integrity of the SESSION ID is preserved in transit; the exact 
   mechanisms to be used and the format of the SESSION ID are 
   implementation dependent. 
    
 
 
5.2 The associated model with one policy server 
    
   In this model, the contents of the AUTH_SESSION policy element MUST 
   include: 
    
   -  A session identifier - SESSION_ID. This is information that the 
      authorizing entity can use to correlate the resource reservation 
      request with the media authorized during session set up. 
     
   -  The identity of the authorizing entity _ AUTH_ENT_ID. This 
      information is used by the Edge Router to determine which 
      authorizing entity (Policy Server) should be used to solicit 
      resource policy decisions. 
    
   In some environments, an Edge Router may have no means for 
   determining if the identity refers to a legitimate Policy Server 
   within its domain. In order to protect against redirection of 
   authorization requests to a bogus authorizing entity, the 
   AUTH_SESSION MUST also include: 
    
   -  AUTHENTICATION_DATA. This authentication data is calculated over   
      all other fields of the AUTH_SESSION policy element. 
     
    
 


Internet Draft         Session Authorization for RSVP          June 2002 
                                     
 
5.3 The associated model with two policy servers 
    
   The content of the AUTH_SESSION Policy Element is identical to the 
   associated model with one policy server. 
    
5.4 The non-associated model 
    
   In this model, the AUTH_SESSION MUST contain sufficient information 
   to allow the Policy Server to make resource policy decisions 
   autonomously from the authorizing entity. The policy element is 
   created using information about the session by the authorizing 
   entity. The information in the AUTH_SESSION policy element MUST 
   include: 
    
   -  Calling party IP address or Identity (e.g. FQDN) - SOURCE_ADDR S-
      TYPE 
   -  Called party IP address or Identity (e.g. FQDN) - DEST_ADDR S-
      TYPE 
   -  The characteristics of (each of) the media stream(s) authorized 
      for this session - RESOURCES S-TYPE 
   -  The authorization lifetime - START_TIME S-TYPE 
   -  The identity of the authorizing entity to allow for validation of 
      the token in shared private key and Kerberos schemes - 
      AUTH_ENT_ID S-TYPE 
   -  The credentials of the authorizing entity in a public-key scheme 
      - AUTH_ENT_ID S-TYPE 
   -  Authentication data used to prevent tampering with the 
      AUTH_SESSION policy element - AUTHENTICATION_DATA 
    
   Furthermore, the AUTH_SESSION policy element MAY contain: 
    
   -  The lifetime of (each of) the media stream(s) - END_TIME S-TYPE 
   -  Calling party port number - SOURCE_ADDR S-TYPE 
   -  Called party port number - DEST_ADDR S-TYPE 
    
   All AUTH_SESSION fields MUST match with the resource request. If a 
   field does not match, the request SHOULD be denied. 
    
    
6. Message Processing Rules 
    
6.1 Message Generation (RSVP Host) 
    
   An RSVP message is created as specified in [RFC-2205] with following 
   modifications. 
    
   1. RSVP message MUST contain at most one AUTH_SESSION policy 
   element. 
    
   2. A Session Authorization policy element (AUTH_SESSION) is created 
   and the IdentityType field is set to indicate the identity type 
 


Internet Draft         Session Authorization for RSVP          June 2002 
                                     
 
   in the policy element. Only the required Session Authorization 
   attributes are added. 
          
   3. POLICY_DATA object (containing the AUTH_SESSION policy element) 
   is inserted in the RSVP message in the appropriate place.  
    
6.2 Message Reception (Router) 
    
   RSVP message is processed as specified in [RFC-2205] with following 
   modifications. 
    
   1. If router is policy aware then it SHOULD send the RSVP 
   message to the PDP and wait for response. If the router is 
   policy unaware then it ignores the policy data objects and 
   continues processing the RSVP message. 
    
   2. Reject the message if the response from the PDP is negative. 
    
   3. Continue processing the RSVP message. 
    
6.3 Authorization (Router/PDP) 
    
   1. Retrieve the AUTH_SESSION policy element. Check the PE type 
   field and return an error if the identity type is not supported. 
    
   2. Verify the message integrity. 
    
   - Shared private key authentication: Get authorizing entity ID,  
     identify appropriate algorithm and shared private key for the    
     authorizing entity, and validate signature. 
    
   - Public Key: Validate the certificate chain against 
     trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and validate the 
     message signature using the public key. 
    
   - Kerberos Ticket: If the AUTH_ENT_ID is of subtype KRB_PRINCIPAL,  
     Request a ticket for the authorizing entity (principal@realm) 
     from the local KDC. Use the ticket to access the authorizing  
     entity and obtain authentication data for the message. 
    
   3. Verify the requested resources do not exceed the authorized QoS. 
    
    
7. Error Signaling 
    
   If a PDP fails to verify the AUTH_SESSION policy element then it 
   MUST return a policy control failure (Error Code = 02) to the PEP. 
   The error values are described in [RFC-2205] and [RFC-2750]. Also 
   the PDP SHOULD supply a policy data object containing an AUTH_DATA 
   Policy Element with A-Type=POLICY_ERROR_CODE containing more 
   details on the Policy Control failure [RFC-3182]. The PEP 
 


Internet Draft         Session Authorization for RSVP          June 2002 
                                     
 
   MUST include this Policy Data object in the outgoing RSVP Error 
   message. 
    
8. IANA Considerations 
    
   Following the policies outlined in [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS], Standard 
   RSVP Policy Elements (P-type values) are assigned by IETF Consensus 
   action as described in [RFC-2750]. 
    
   P-Type AUTH_SESSION is assigned the value TBD-by-IANA. 
    
   Following the policies outlined in [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS], session 
   authorization attribute types (S-Type)in the range 0-127 are 
   allocated through an IETF Consensus action; S-Type values between 
   128-255 are reserved for Private Use and are not assigned by IANA. 
    
   S-Type AUTH_ENT_ID is assigned the value 1.   
   S-Type SESSION_ID is assigned the value 2.   
   S-Type SOURCE_ADDR is assigned the value 3.  
   S-Type DEST_ADDR is assigned the value 4.  
   S-Type START_TIME is assigned the value 5.

9. Security Considerations 
    
   The purpose of this draft is to describe a mechanism for session 
   authorization to prevent theft of service.  
    
   Replay attacks MUST be prevented. In the non-associated model, the 
   AUTH_SESSION policy element MUST include a START_TIME field. The 
   start time is used to verify that the request is not being replayed 
   at a later time. In all other models, the SESSION_ID is used by the 
 


Internet Draft         Session Authorization for RSVP          June 2002 
                                     
 
   Policy Server to ensure that the resource request successfully 
   correlates with records of an authorized session. If a AUTH_SESSION 
   is replayed, it MUST be detected by the policy server (using 
   internal algorithms) and the request MUST be rejected. 
    
   To ensure that the integrity of the policy element is preserved in  
   untrusted environments, the AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute MUST be 
   included.  
    
   In order to keep the AUTH_SESSION policy element size to a strict 
   minimum, in environments where shared private keys are possible, 
   they should be used. This is especially true in wireless 
   environments where the AUTH_SESSION policy element is sent over-the-
   air. The shared private keys authentication option MUST be supported 
   by all AUTH_SESSION implementations. 
    
   If shared private keys are not a valid option, the Kerberos 
   authentication mechanism is reasonably well secured and efficient in 
   terms of AUTH_SESSION size. The AUTH_SESSION only needs to contain 
   the principal@realm name of the authorizing entity. This is much 
   more efficient than the PKI authentication option. 
          
   PKI authentication option provides a high level of security and good 
   scalability, however it requires the presence of credentials in the 
   AUTH_SESSION policy element which impacts its size.
