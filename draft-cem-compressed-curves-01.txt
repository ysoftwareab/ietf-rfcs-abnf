               TLS Compressed Elliptic Curve Code Points
                     draft-cem-compressed-curves-01

Abstract

   This document defines new Transport Layer Security (TLS) Supported
   Groups to allow negotiation in TLS for encoding certain elliptic
   curve public keys in a compressed form rather than the more verbose
   method specified in [RFC8446] and [RFC8422].

1.  Introduction

   Versions of TLS prior to 1.3 allowed for Elliptic Curve Cryptography
   (ECC) Point Compression negotiation, by sending a however in TLS 1.3
   and Section 5.1.2 of [RFC8422], that mechanism was deprecated in
   favor of having one point encoding format for each negotiated curve.
   Utilizing point compression is important to reduce the size of
   negotiated curves within TLS in general, but especially with
   [I-D.draft-ietf-tls-ctls].

   The code points defined in this document are intended for use in TLS,
   dTLS, cTLS, and other similar protocols that negotiate Elliptic Curve
   Groups for key exchange.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   All TLS notation comes from Section 3 of [RFC8446].

2.  Supported Groups

   This document defines three new TLS Supported Groups for the
   compressed forms of secp256r1, secp384r1, and secp521r1 (collectively
   colloquially called the NIST Curves).  The compressed forms of these
   groups are indicated by adding a letter 'c' at the end of the
   descriptive name.  The new groups are secp256r1c, secp384r1c, and
   secp521r1c.  TLS groups using compressed NIST curves MUST use these
   newly defined group identifiers.

   The "TLS Supported Groups" name space is maintained by IANA.

   enum {
     secp256r1c(tbd1), secp384r1c(tbd2), secp521r1c(tbd3)
   } NamedGroup;

   struct {
     NamedGroup named_group_list<2..2^16-1>;
   } NamedGroupList;

2.1.  ECDHE Parameters

   In Section 4.2.8.2 of [RFC8446] the encoding method for ECDHE
   Parameters is described, this document adds a new struct to serialize
   the new parameters.  The method for determining the values for the
   elements of the serialized structure are documented in [SEC1].

   For secp256r1c, secp384r1c, and secp521r1c, the contents are the
   serialized value of the following struct defined using the
   presentation language in Section 3 of [RFC8446]:

   struct {
     CompressedY;
     opaque X[coordinate_length];
   } CompressedPointRepresentation;

   enum { evenY(2), oddY(3) } CompressedY

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign the value tbd1 to secp256r1c, the value
   tbd2 to secp384r1c, and the value tbd3 to secp521r1c in the "TLS
   Supported Groups" registry.  For these three new supported groups the
   "DTLS OK" is set to 'Y'.  For tbd1 and tbd2 the "Recommended" column
   is set to 'Y' and for tbd3 the "Recommended" column is set to 'N'.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8422] and [RFC8422] apply to the
   selection of TLS named groups and the use of the curves specified in
   this document.
