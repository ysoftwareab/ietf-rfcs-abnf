1. Introduction 

   Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging approach to 
   networking and has great potential to shift paradigm in the field of 
   network control and management. SDN greatly simplifies the network 
   control and management by separating the control plane from data 
   plane, which allows network operators to manage network services on 
   an abstraction of the underlying physical networks. SDN requires 
   some method for the control plane to communicate with the data

   plane. OpenFlow is one of such mechanisms and is under development 
   to provide standardized communication [OpenFlow]. 

   Specifically, for transport network, the idea of SDN is a perfect 
   choice for future development due to the natural separation of data 
   and control planes. There are some emerging service features and 
   requirements for transport networks that include services that are 
   time scheduled, dynamic, elastic, and underpinned by a Pay As You Go 
   billing model. These features require the transport controllers to 
   provide services with large bandwidth in a short period. All of the 
   above are the motivations for introducing the SDN idea into the 
   transport network. 

   Path Computation Element (PCE) was firstly developed to solve the 
   path computation problem for MPLS and GMPLS-controlled networks 
   [RFC4655]. Given the demand to simplify the network management and a 
   centralized PCE, the functional transport architecture is very close 
   to the idea of Software-defined Networking (SDN). In the SDN 
   architecture, PCE can be envisioned to be a core functional block in 
   the SDN controller, responsible not only for path computation but 
   for other functions such as provisioning and abstraction control. 

   This draft intends to discuss how the PCE architecture and PCEP 
   protocol developed to date can support the transport SDN by 
   analyzing the role PCE plays in some typical use cases. 

      Optical Enterprise network 

   PCE can provide transport service in small-scale enterprise network, 
   which is under a totally centralized control environment.  

      Virtualized transport network 

   PCE can be used for virtual service provisioning. In this way 
   clients can propose various network requests to operators.  

      Data-center Interconnection 

   Current PCE architecture and protocol can support transport services 
   provisioning in data-center Interconnection Networks.  

      Packet-optical Integration 

   Packet traffic can be transported over optical transport network. 
   The path computation in this case can be supported by coordinating 
   between Packet PCE and Optical PCE.

   This draft describes several classic scenarios in transport network, 
   to demonstrate the current PCE can be extended beyond path 
   computation functionality.  

   There is NO protocol extension (such as PCEP) in this draft. We only 
   focus on how current PCE (including RFCs and some WG/I-D Draft) can 
   satisfy the requirements.

               Fig. 1 Generic Architecture of Transport SDN 

   As shown in Fig. 1, transport network controller (TNC) is core block 
   that connects with both clients and physical network infrastructure. 
   PCE is one of the functional blocks in the TNC for path computation. 
   In general, to request a transport service, client controller sends 
   a request with path requirement to TNC. PCE will compute a path 
   according to the request, and report the result to client.  

   For path establishment, the client will trigger the TNC and then TNC 
   will operate on the physical network infrastructure, for example, 
   network elements.

2.2. Path computation and establishment 

   2.2.1 Stateless PCE 

   The PCE Protocol (PCEP) is the protocol that enables the 
   communication between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCE. It 
   was firstly developed to support a stateless PCE with in [RFC4655]. 
   PCCs will send path computation requests via the Path Computation 
   Request (PCReq) message to a Path Computation Elements (PCE). The 
   PCE, upon receiving this request, will calculate a path or multiple 
   paths and reply the result to the PCC via the Path Computation Reply 
   (PCRep) message. During the computation, the PCE has access to the 
   Traffic Engineering Database (TED). Network topology and resource 
   usage information are stored in the TED. Specific path computation 
   algorithms or policy-based routing schemes are out of scope for this 
   draft. Other details for PCEP can be referred to [RFC5440]. 

   2.2.2 Stateful PCE 

   In stateless PCE the network information is managed in TED. However, 
   the state of active LSPs is not managed by PCE and as such there may 
   some limitations for real-time, dynamic LSP operations with 
   stateless PCE. With dynamic configuration and management request, 
   there will be resource contention problem in PCE. To address this 
   issue, stateful PCE is introduced in [draft-ietf-pce-stateful-pce-
   07], with a LSP Database (LSPD) in the PCE. The LSPD allows 
   efficient LSP state synchronization between PCC and PCEs. A 
   delegation mode is proposed, with allowing PCC to delegate control 
   of its LSP to an active stateful PCE. 

   The stateful PCE can be applied in various scenarios, as presented 
   in [draft-ietf-pce-stateful-pce-app-01], including online 
   optimization, bandwidth scheduling, recovery and so on.  

   2.2.3 PCE Initiation 

   More dynamical management over LSP is proposed in [draft-ietf-pce-
   pce-initiated-lsp-00], named as PCE initiation. In this mechanism, 
   PCE is able to trigger the creation of LSPs on demand, which is 
   especially suitable for a controller-based network in service 
   provisioning and path setup.  

   One of the typical applications for PCE initiation is the path 
   computing in SDN. When the request is generated from application 
   stratum, the PCE can compute the path and directly set it up, 
   instead of responding and triggering the application to establish 
   the connection. This new mechanism is more efficient than stateful 
   PCE and can provide better real-time performance in a dynamic 
   transport network.

3. PCE Applicability for Transport SDN 

   Several applications are proposed under the transport SDN 
   arhictecture to demonstrate its ability to enhance the control and 
   management of transport networks, such as virtual transport 
   services, data center interconnection network and so on. For these 
   applications, PCE is playing an important role. In the following 
   sub-sections, we describe how the PCE and its protocol can support 
   applications in transport SDN via some typical examples.

                        /     |     \ 
                       /      |      \ 
                  +-----+  +-----+ +-----+ 
                  | NE1 |  | NE2 | | NE3 | 
                  +-----+  +-----+ +-----+ 

   Fig. 2: PCE Control over Network Element  

   The enterprise networks are usually a small-scale network with 
   limited network elements. For simplicity, we assume in this use case 
   one PCE is enough for path computation, i.e., no multi-domain or 
   inter-PCE communication is involved. As shown in Fig. 2, NEs are 
   directly connected with PCE.  

   NEs can be but not limited to data centers. NEs are considered as 
   PCC to create request for path computation and establishment. PCEP 
   can be used for communication between PCCs and PCE, through the 
   interfaces between PCE and NEs. Stateful PCE is suited for this use 
   case for dynamic service provisioning, since the path is setup by 
   the PCC directly.  

3.2.  Virtualized Transport Network 

   Virtual transport service (VTS) is one of the advantages of 
   transport SDN. The architecture of providing VTS is described in Fig. 
   3.

   In this use case, the network elements are totally infrastructure 
   and we do not consider NE as PCC anymore. The path computation in 
   this case can be divided into two types: virtual path computation 
   and physical path computation.  

   The virtual path computation requests come from the client 
   controller and are sent to the virtualized network controller (VNC) 
   in the transport controller. Virtual network information such as 
   topology and available resources are stored in the VNC to determine 
   whether the requests can be satisfied or not and then respond the

   result to client controller. In this procedure, the VNC can be 
   treated as a PCE, and the interaction between client controller (PCC) 
   and VNC (PCE) is achieved via corresponding interface between PCC 
   and PCE.  

   The physical path computation is similar as described in section 3.1. 
   The PCE is connected with NEs for path computation. VNC projected 
   the virtual path request from client controller to a physical path 
   request and send it to PCE. The request is from the VNC via a 
   provider interface, which can be either considered as an internal 
   interface in transport controller or an external interface between 
   two blocks, depends on implementation policy. By receiving the 
   request, PCE will check the availability of resources and respond to 
   VNC, also via provider interface.  

   The path establishment can be completed by stateless PCE, stateful 
   PCE or PCE initiation. Stateless and stateful PCE will allocate the 
   physical resource by configuring the NEs after receiving the 
   corresponding message from PCC. In PCE initiation, dynamic creation 
   and teardown of LSPs are supported by PCE together with responding 
   LSP information to PCCs.  

3.3.  Data center interconnection 

   The virtual network services in Data Center Interconnection Network 
   are described in this section. As shown in Fig. 4, the DC controller 
   is connected with network provider controller, while DCs are 
   connected with NEs respectively.  

   In this use case it is assumed that Data center controller knows all 
   information, including endpoints interfaces, resource, location 
   information and any other application/user related information. For 
   the DC interconnection application, the client controller is the DC 
   controller, which can be an internal entity or an external entity 
   with respect to the relationship with the service provider.

   Fig. 4 Use case: Data Center Interconnection Network  

   In this use case the Network Provider Controller is playing as PCE 
   and DC controller is corresponding PCC. The requests can be either 
   from DC or the DC controller, with the DC controller have a full 
   visibility of all DCs. PCE is used to respond the path computation 
   request, to provide virtual network services. Stateless/Stateful PCE 
   and PCE initiation are all applicable in this case, similar as the 
   way described in Section 4.2. The communication between DC 
   controller and Network Provider Controller can also be implemented 
   via PCEP.

                Fig. 5 Use Case: Packet Optical Integration 

   In this use case we describe packet traffic transported over an 
   optical transport server network (potentially incorporating multiple 
   layer networks), as shown in Fig. 5. The objective of this use case 
   is for packet and optical topologies to be jointly optimized for 
   greater efficiency, taking advantage of knowledge of topologies and 
   status, as well as dynamic capabilities supported by the optical 
   transport network. 

   There can be a few variations for path computation in this case, 
   depends on where the PCE is located. In this draft we assume that 
   there is one PCE located in Packet network controller and another 
   PCE located in Optical Network controller, respectively. A joint 
   optimization is applied by Network Provider controller, which is 
   connected with PCEs, for better resource utilization. Moreover, 
   client controller is also connected with network provider 
   controller. 

   In this case the path computation request is from the client 
   controller. All the three controllers has their respective TED and 
   LSPD (only if stateful or PCE initiation) and there are some

   synchronization mechanisms among them to guarantee the resource 
   consistency. Once the path computation request arrives the network 
   provider controller, it will be decomposed according to the network 
   topology and sent to the IP-PCE and Optical PCE respectively. The 
   IP-PCE and Optical PCE will then compute the path and respond. 

   The procedure of path establishment is similar as described in 
   section 4.2, which is applicable via stateless PCE, stateful PCE and 
   PCE initiation respectively. Communications among the controllers in 
   Fig. 5 can be achieved by PCEP.
