Abstract

   IPv4 address is estimated to run out shortly. So as 
   [I-D.durand-v6ops-natv4v6v4] stated, we have to consider IPv6 only 
   node for smooth transition. On the other hand, IETF have deprecated 
   the NAT-PT with some reasons. And now we need to seek alternative
   solutions. Before talking specific technology, we need to consider
   overall strategy for translation technology.

Internet-Draft      Translator specification approach      November 2007


1.  Introduction

   This memo will present an overlooking view on IPv6 deployment and
   some of the necessary technologies to achieve it.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  The Devices we have to take care

   As [I-D.durand-v6ops-natv4v6v4] stated, it is estimated that IPv4
   address exhaustion coming
   sooner, as early as 2010. So, preparation is required by then.
   In that time, there would be IPv4 devices and IPv6 devices. And the 
   IPv6 devices can consist of current type and new type. The new type
   means some devices which can co-exist translator very well(e.g., as
   proposed by [I-D.carpenter-shanti] and 
   [I-D.beijnum-modified-nat-pt]). The current type means some devices
   that does not care about translator(e.g., can not distinguish 
   translated address from native address). Also we could not expect to
   modify current IPv4 devices to adopt the environment using 
   translator.


3.  Translators in the market

   As described in [RFC4966], NAT-PT has some problems. On the other
   hand, there are some translator product in the market. They have 
   already known the problem of NAT-PT and have devised to be useful 
   although there are not well working standard translator 
   specification. It may not be the perfect solution but the products 
   can satisfy some requirements.


4.  Translators in the future

   There are some proposals for translation technology like 
   [I-D.carpenter-shanti] and [I-D.beijnum-modified-nat-pt]. Some of 
   them could require some modification on IPv6 devices to work with 
   translator nicely. It is desired approach to resolve most issues 
   listed on [RFC4966]. The important point here is design based on the
   requirements.

5.  Proposal strategy

   Considering above mentioned situation, the new translators might not 
   be the solution for 2010. Of course we know that current of-the-shelf 
   translator would not be the final solution in long term view.
   But both are important to support smooth and rapid IPv6 deployment.


5.1. Current translator model description

   The current translation technology would help smooth IPv6 
   introduction around 2010. But it may not be the perfect solution. 
   So we should know the current technology. And we should consider 
   what kind of technology fits what kind of situation. And we should 
   give recommendation how to use it.
   The big advantage of this kind of document is not-keeping users and 
   developers waiting for the definition of new translation technology.
   This kind of document should be BCPs.


5.2. New translator model specification

   As we realized that translator is required. But current technology 
   may not be the perfect solution. So we need to define the 
   specification to resolve issues listed on [RFC4966].
   The big advantage of this kind of document is providing safety and 
   optimization.
   This kind of document would be RFCs.


5.3. Common translation rule

   In chapter 3 and 4 of [RFC2765](SIIT), there are translation rule.
   It is referred by NAT-PT, obsoluted by [RFC4966], and other 
   implementations may be compliant with the rule, since it is 
   reasonable and common rule. 
   It is useful to have such kind of documents. But now the ICMPv6 
   specification is revised by [RFC4443]. The translation rule should 
   be updated. This kind of documents should be independent from 
   specific translation technology. Especially, the common translation 
   rule for ICMP message is very important.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


8.  Security Considerations

   Security issues associated with NAT have long been documented. 
   This memo itself has no security issue.
