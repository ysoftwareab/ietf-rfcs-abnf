1.    Introduction  
  
     
   The OASIS Universal Description Discovery & Integration (UDDI)  
   Version 3 Specification provides a system for registering and 
   discovering the information required to use a Web service and 
   information about the provider offering the Web service. The focus of 
   UDDI is the definition of a set of services supporting the 
   description and discovery of (1) businesses, organizations, and other 
   Web services providers, (2) the Web services they make available, and 
   (3) the technical interfaces which may be used to access those 
   services. Each of the enumerated entities is uniquely identified in a 
   UDDI registry by a unique key to facilitate queries and updates 
   pertaining to the entity. 
    
1.1     Licensing and Availability 
    
   The UDDI Version 3 Specification may be used under the terms set 
   forth in the OASIS IPR Policy [4].  Under that policy, information 
   regarding claims and licenses is available at [http://www.oasis-
   open.org/committees/uddi-spec/ipr.php] 
    
2.    URI Scheme Formal Syntax Definition and Character Encoding 
 
   A UDDI URI is the unique key for each entity in a UDDI registry. The 
   complete ABNF grammar in Section 2.1 is the only authoritative syntax 
   definition. 
    
2.1     ABNF Grammar 
    
   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur 
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [5]. 
 
   uddiScheme           =  %d117.100.100.105 ; "uddi" in lower case 
    
   uddiKey              =  keyGeneratorKey / nonKeyGeneratorKey 
    
   nonKeyGeneratorKey   =  uuidKey / domainKey / derivedKey 
    
   uuidKey              =  uddiScheme ":" uuid_part

   uuid_part            =  8HEXDIG "-" 
                           4HEXDIG "-" 
                           4HEXDIG "-" 
                           4HEXDIG "-" 
                           12HEXDIG 
    
   domainKey            =  uddiScheme ":" hostname 
    
   hostname             =  *(domainlabel ".") toplabel ["."] 
    
   domainlabel          =  alphanum /  
                           alphanum *(alphanum / "-") alphanum 
    
   toplabel             =  ALPHA / ALPHA *(alphanum / "-") alphanum 
    
   alphanum             =  ALPHA / DIGIT 
    
   derivedKey           =  nonKeyGeneratorKey ":" KSS 
    
   keyGeneratorKey      =  nonKeyGeneratorKey ":" "keygenerator" 
    
   KSS                  =  1*uric ; KSS MUST NOT BE "keygenerator" 
    
   Uric                 =  reserved / unreserved / escaped 
    
   reserved             =  ";" / "/" / "?" / ":" / "@" / "&" / 
                           "=" / "+" / "$" / "," 
    
   unreserved           =  alphanum / mark 
    
   mark                 =  "-" / "_" / "." / "!" / "~" / "*" / 
                           "'" / "(" / ")" 
    
   escaped              =  "%"  HEXDIG HEXDIG 
    
   There are some extra restrictions on domain names that are not 
   captured in the ABNF syntax above: 
    
   1. The maximum length of a string representation of a domain name is 
   253 characters/octets. 
    
   2. The maximum length of an individual domainlabel is 63 
   characters/octets. 
    
   3. KSS must not be "keygenerator"

        UDDI URI Scheme Registration with IANA             July 2004 
 
 
3.   Intended Usage 
 
   A UDDI URI is intended to represent a uddiKey to reference an entity 
   within a given UDDI registry.  Within a given registry each uddiKey 
   references only one entity.  The uddiKey for an entity can be used 
   for internal referencing pointers from one UDDI entity to another 
   using a uddiKey.  An example of an internal reference in UDDI is that 
   several Web services implementing the same specification should all 
   reference the same Web service concept (tModel) by using the uddiKey 
   for the tModel in the technical fingerprint of the service (tModelKey 
   contained in a child of the bindingTemplate). The uddiKey for an 
   entity can also be used for external referencing where the 
   combination of a SOAP endpoint to access the registry plus a UDDI key 
   allows a UDDI aware application to retrieve a particular entity in 
   that registry. 
    
4.   Applications and or protocols which may use the UDDI URI scheme 
    
   UDDI aware applications make extensive use of the UDDI URI scheme to 
   identify the entities in a registry. These UDDI aware applications 
   use a particular UDDI URI within a particular registry to reference 
   the meta-data for Web service providers (businessEntity elements) and 
   Web service concepts (tModel elements) and the actual Web service 
   meta-data itself (businessService and bindingTemplate elements). 
    
5.   Security Considerations 
    
   When a UDDI URI is carried within SOAP messages to a UDDI registry, 
   security is addressed by framework and policies of the UDDI node 
   receiving the message as part of the registry. As indicated in the 
   UDDI specification, the security is addressed within the 
   corresponding protocol.  
        
   In general, security, as it relates to the usage and carriage of a    
   UDDI URI, is considered as an issue that should be addressed within   
   scope of UDDI security framework and policies or other relevant 
   protocols and is not within the scope of this document. 
    
   The primary security issue relating specifically to a UDDI URI is 
   that the mapping between the entity and the UDDI URI is registry 
   specific.  This means that it is necessary for applications for and 
   users of UDDI registries to ensure that no assumption about identity 
   of an entity is derived solely from the uddiKey. 
    
6.   IANA Considerations 
    
   The purpose of this document is serving as a reference point for the    
   purposes of registering the UDDI URI scheme with IANA.

   Having the URI registered with IANA will ensure that there is no    
   duplication of the URI scheme "uddi". This document reproduces the    
   exact definition of the scheme from the UDDI Version 3.0 
   specification
