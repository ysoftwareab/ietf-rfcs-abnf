2.  Definitions 
 
   This document uses the following terms to describe geo LCI binary to 
decimal conversion: 
 
   Location Configuration Information: (LCI) An object that carries 
location information.  LCI has no ability to express privacy rules as 
outlined in [3] and [4], therefore is considered part of the 'sighting' 
function.  For purposes of this discussion, all references to LCI refer to 
its use in [1]. 
 
   GNU Compiler Collection: (GCC) The GNU Compiler Collection is a set of 
programming language compilers produced by the GNU Project. 
 
3.   Introduction 
 
The LCI encodes a point's latitude, longitude and altitude, along with the 
resolution of that point.  LCI does not encode boundaries of an arbitrary 
region.  The resolution is nothing more than the representation of 
significant digits for the fixed-length, binary values in the LCI. 
 
Format conversion is required between the binary LCI that a host can 
receive through DHCP [1] or LLDP-MED [5] and the decimal representation 
used by applications, e.g. PIDF-LO [2].  This conversion could be used by 
a host that provides its location to another party with the privacy rules 
of the [2], including to a server authorized to redistribute the 
information.  It is unclear why anyone would need to convert from the 
geographic-coordinate location format of [2] to the LCI.

Internet-Draft                   geo LCI to PIDF-LO          October 2006 

This section provides an overview of the programming hints in the next 
section for the translation from the efficient binary representation of 
the LCI [1][5] to the decimal string representation of geographic location 
used in PIDF-LO [2], for example.  GCC syntax is used because it is well 
known.  The binary values are converted to decimal, with the invalid bits 
removed and with the number of significant digits determined by the 
resolution of the binary values. 
 
After unpacking the network-order bytes of the LCI into C variables 
sufficiently large to accommodate the fields, the sign bit of the twos-
complement integers are extended to the size of the variable.  The sign 
bit at 34 bits to the left is tested with an octal constant containing 33 
bits in 11 octal zeros.  If negative, the lower 34 bits of a constant 
minus-one are inverted with XOR, and then (inclusive) ORed with the LCI 
value.  This operation is safe to perform more than once. 
 
Because [1] says "Contents beyond the claimed resolution MAY be randomized 
...", these contents are erased, i.e. set to zero.  The number of bits to 
erase is the field length minus the resolution of the value in that field.  
A mask is constructed by left-shifting a one into the right of the mask 
for as many bits as to be erased.  ANDing the inverse of the mask with the 
value erases the invalid bits. 
 
The fixed-point fraction values are scaled into a floating-point (double 
for enough precision) by dividing by the constant reflecting the number of 
fractional bits.  Note that latitude and longitude have 25 bits of 
fraction, while altitude has only 22 bits.  The number of significant 
digits to the right of the decimal point is the resolution minus its 
integer portion, scaled by 3 decimal digits for 10 binary digits because 
10 to the 3rd = 1000 approximates 2 to the 10th = 1024. 
 
5. Programming hints 
 
    The LCI format is as follows:

Assume the following element values have been unpacked from the 16 bytes 
of the wire protocol above.  
 
struct { 
     int8 code;      /* DHCP LCI option code = 123  */ 
     int8 length;     /* length 16 bytes - not incl code + length */ 
     int8 LaRes;      /* Latitude Resolution 6 bits */ 
     int64 Latitude   /* Latitude 34 bits, 25 fractional */ 
     int8 LoRes;      /* Longitude Resolution 6 bits */ 
     int64 Longitude  /* Latitude 34 bits, 25 fractional */ 
     int8 AltType     /* Altitude Type 4 bits */ 
     int8 AltRes      /* Altitude Resolution 6 bits */ 
     int64 Altitude   /* Altitude 30 bits 22 bits Fraction */ 
     int8 Datum      /* Datum code 8 bits */       
} LCIoption; 
 
Because the latitude, longitude, and altitude values are twos complement 
of non-standard length, they require sign-extension that is not built into 
typical variable types. For the Latitude 
example: 
 
struct LCIoption OptIn; 
/* unpack into elements */ 
 
if (OptIn.Latitude & 010000000000LL)  
          OptIn.Latitude = (-1 ^ 017777777777LL) | OptIn.Latitude 
      /* ^ is XOR to flip one bits to zero before ORing in the field */ 
     /* if negative 34-bit field, set all one-bits above 34-bit field */ 
 
Translation from the binary resolution of the LCI to the correct number of 
significant decimal digits in the character string representation used for 
numbers in PIDF-LO is as in the following example for 
Longitude: 
 
eraseBits = 34 - OptIn.LoRes; 
int64 mask = 0LL; 
if (eraseBits > 0) while (eraseBits--) mask = (mask << 1) | 1;  
                              /* mask bit == 1 for invalid bits */ 
OptIn.Longitude &= ~mask;     
                    /* invert mask and AND to zero invalid bits */ 
 
double longitude = OptIn.Longitude / exp2 (25);       
                    /* scale integer for 25 bits of fraction */ 
int8 LongFractDigits = (OptIn.LoRes - 9) * 3 / 10;    
                    /* deduct integer part, 2 to 10 ~= 10 to 3  */ 
if (LongFractDigits < 0) LongFractDigits = 0; 
          /* 34 bits is about 10 digits, plus 1 for sign */  
printf ("%11.*F", LongFractDigits, longitude);

6. Calculation of LCI values 
 
Since the Global Positioning System (GPS) or survey methods do not provide 
location in the LCI format, this section illustrates how a network 
administrator might calculate the values in preparation for delivering 
them to hosts connected to her network. 
 
Where geographic location is expressed with the correct number of 
significant digits, it is easy to compute resolution because 3 decimal 
digits approximate 10 bits.  The number of digits to the right of the 
decimal point, times 10, divided by 3 is the number of fractional bits.  
Adding 9 for the integer part yields the resolution. 
 
Where a geographic location comes with an explicit error specification, 
this error can be translated into the resolution of the LCI.  If the error 
measure is in distance (e.g. meters) rather than degrees, the conversion 
of longitude to degrees depends on the distance from the equator.  
Dividing the error distance by the distance for one degree (computed with 
the method described at [6]) yields the error in (presumably fractional) 
degrees. 
 
double ErrorDegrees;         
int64 FixedPntErrDeg = ErrorDegrees / exp2(25);       
               /*  convert error to fixed point 25-bit fraction */ 
 
int 64 TopBit = 010000000000LL; 
if (FixedPntErrDeg & TopBit) FixedPntErrDeg = - FixedPntErrDeg;  
                              /* if negative make positive */ 
int8 resolution = 0; 
 
while (~(FixedPntErrDeg & (TopBit >>= 1))) resolution++;   
               /* shift test bit to find first non-zero error */ 
               /* this is the number of valid bits */ 
 
If all that is available is the bounding points of a region, the 
difference between the extremes and the center in both latitude and 
longitude estimates the error in degrees, which can be converted to 
resolution as above.  Find the maximum and minimum of both, calculate the 
value of the latitude/longitude as the average, and half the difference as 
the error. 
 
For the example bounds ranging about 0.5 meters in distances across about 
32 degrees, the binary and decimal values are as follows: 
 
             binary                    decimal 
000011111.1111111111111111111001110  31.99999850 
000100000.0000000000000000001011100  32.00000274 
 
001000000.0000000000000000000101010  64.00000124  sum 
000100000.0000000000000000000010101  32.00000062  average 
000000000.0000000000000000010001110  00.00000423  difference

With 26 bits above the difference, which is twice the error, this example 
yields 27 bits of resolution (remembering to add 9 bits for left of the 
binary point).
