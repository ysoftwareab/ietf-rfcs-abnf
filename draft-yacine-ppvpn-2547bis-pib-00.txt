Abstract 
   
   This document describes a Policy Information Base (PIB) for a device
   implementing the BGP/MPLS VPN [2547bis] Architecture. The 
   Provisioning Classes defined here provide policy control of resources 
   implementing the BGP/MPLS VPN Architecture. These Provisioning 
   Classes can be used with other non BGP/MPLS VPN Provisioning Classes 
   (defined in other PIBs) to provide for a comprehensive policy 
   controlled mapping of service requirements to device resource 
   capability and usage.

2. Introduction 
   
   [SPPI] describes a structure for specifying policy information that 
   can then be transmitted to a network device for the purpose of 
   configuring policy at that device.  The model underlying this 
   structure is one of well-defined provisioning classes and instances 
   of these classes residing in a virtual information store called the 
   Policy Information Base (PIB). 
   
   This document specifies a set of provisioning classes specifically 
   for configuring BGP/MPLS VPN services in the PE routers. 
   
   One way to provision policy is by means of the COPS protocol [COPS] 
   with the extensions for provisioning [COPS-PR]. This protocol 
   supports multiple clients, each of which may provision policy for a 
   specific policy domain such as QoS.  The PRCs defined in this 
   BGP/MPLS VPN PPVPN PIB are intended for use by the COPS-PR PPVPN 
   client-type [COPS-PPVPN]. Furthermore, these PRCs are in addition to 
   any other PIBs that may be defined for the PPVPN client type in the 
   future, as well as the PRCs defined in the Framework PIB [FR-PIB]. 
   
   
3. Relationship to the BGP/MPLS VPN MIB
   
   The present version of the BGP/MPLS VPN PIB has been designed to be 
   the closest as possible to the BGP/MPLS VPN MIB [MPLS-VPN-MIB] for 
   data mapping purposes.
   
   However, in order to take advantage of the specifics of SPPI and 
   COPS-PR in general, the BGP/MPLS VPN PIB has its own structure and 
   data organization.
   
   
4. Assumptions and Prerequisites
   
   It is assumed that certain things are configured and operational in
   order for the tables and objects described in this PIB to work
   correctly. These things are outlined below:
   
   
El Mghazli                                                      [Page 3]



Internet Draft     draft-yacine-ppvpn-2547bis-pib-00.txt      April 2002
   
   
   - MPLS in general, must be configured and operational.
   
   - The LSPs establishment between PEs in the provider network is out 
     of the scope of this document. It is the service provider's 
     responsibility to provide internal LSPs in order to connect its PEs 
     together. The LSPs can be either best-effort or QoS-aware, traffic 
     engineered or not, etc.
   
   - The MP-iBGP mechanisms specific to BGP/MPLS VPNs, as well as the 
     communication over the PE-CE links, are assumed to be operational 
     in order to realize the dynamic route distribution between sites 
     according to the VPN policies contained in the PIB.
   
   
5. Operational Overview
   
   - BGP/MPLS VPN management using COPS-PR enables VPN service creation 
     and validation, or building the configuration tools to achieve 
     BGP/MPLS VPN service creation automation.
   
   - The PIB supports BGP/MPLS VPN service as Enterprise VPN, 
     Carrier's Carrier VPN, or Inter/Multi-provider Backbone VPN.
   
   - The PIB supports the maintenance and troubleshooting of BGP/MPLS 
     VPN.
   
   - The PIB supports BGP/MPLS VPNs that are configured on a 
     particular physical interface or sub-interface if the interface can 
     be divided (e.g. Frame Relay, ATM, or Ethernet VLAN) by the router. 
   
   - The PIB must be supported by PEs and shall be used to configure and 
     maintain one or more VPN Routing and Forwarding Tables (VRFs).
   
   
6. PIB overview
   
   This PIB is structured based on the need to configure the VRF 
   realizing a VPN among the different PEs, and the parameterization of 
   these VRFs. 
   
   In addition, the PIB includes tables describing the capabilities and 
   limitations of the device using a general extensible framework. These 
   tables are reported to the PDP and assist the PDP with the 
   configuration of VRFs that can be instantiated by the device. 
   
   Finally, the BGP/MPLS VPN PIB consists of one module containing the 
   base PRCs for setting VPN route distribution policy (VRFs, route 
   targets, etc.) and also contains capability PRCs that allow a PEP to 
   specify its device characteristics to the PDP. The two groups are 
   summarized in this section. 
   
   
6.1 Capabilities Group
   
El Mghazli                                                      [Page 4]



Internet Draft     draft-yacine-ppvpn-2547bis-pib-00.txt      April 2002
   
   
   
   This group consists of PRCs to indicate to the PDP the types of 
   Interface supported on the PEP in terms of their BGP/MPLS VPN 
   capabilities (MPLS support, interface type with respect to the 
   BGP/MPLS VPN mechanisms) and PRCs to indicate the device routing 
   capabilities. This group describes capabilities in terms of the types 
   of interfaces and general routing capabilities of the device.
   It provides a general extensible framework for defining the 
   capabilities and limitations of the elements listed above. The 
   capability tables allow intelligent configuration of the elements by 
   a PDP. 
   
   
Routing Capabilities
   
   This table represents routing capabilities of the device (PE) in 
   terms of protocol support, maximum number of routes and maximum 
   number of VRFs in the PE. The configuration of VRFs in the PE must be 
   according to these values.
   
Interfaces Capabilities
   
   This table represents PE interfaces capabilities essentially in terms 
   of MPLS support. An interface can either support MPLS, MPLS TE 
   tunnels or even not support MPLS at all. In this latter case, such an 
   interface cannot be used for BGP/MPLS VPN purposes.
   
   
6.2 Policy Group
   
   This group contains configuration of the functional elements that 
   comprise the BGP/MPLS VPN route distribution policy that applies to a 
   device. This group contains VRFs and Route Targets, BGP peers, 
   interfaces and routing table for each VRF instance. This group takes 
   configuration in terms of interface types and role combinations 
   [FR-PIB]; it does not deal with individual interfaces on the device 
   (except the ifindex representing the interface correponding to the 
   next hop in the VRF route table).
   
   
VRF Table
   
   This table specifies BGP/MPLS VPN VRF Table associated information. 
   Entries in this table define VRF routing instances associated with 
   BGP/MPLS VPN interfaces or sub-interfaces. A specific Route 
   Distinguisher is affected to each VRF in each PE. The whole pool of 
   RDs is managed by the PDP.
   
Route Target Table
   
   This table contains the objects necessary to configure and monitor 
   route targets for a particular VRF. According to BGP/MPLS VPN 
   framework [2547bis], the configuration of import and export route

Internet Draft     draft-yacine-ppvpn-2547bis-pib-00.txt      April 2002
   
   
   targets realize topological route distribution policies and, as a 
   consequence, the so-called VPNs.
   
Interface Table
   
   This table contains per-interface configuration information related 
   to PE-CE links participating in BGP/MPLS VPNs. This table also takes 
   configuration in terms of interface types and role combinations 
   [FR-PIB].
   
BGP Peer Table
   
   This class contains the BGP peers of the device for a particular VRF. 
   Based on the information contained in this table, the PE 
   implementation can build outbound/inbound route filters.
   
Routing Table
   
   The role of the VRF routes table is mainly to allow the network 
   manager to monitor the content of the VRF specific routing table and 
   also to configure static routes within the backbone.
   
   
7.  PIB Usage Example
   
   Bellow is an example of a fulfilled BGP/MPLS VPN PIB.
   
-- Local settings:
   
   The following tables are BGP/MPLS VPN specific. They give an example 
   of the routing and interface capabilities for a particular device 
   (PE). These information are sent to the PDP mainly at the beginning 
   of the session.
   
   ppvpn2547RoutingCapsTable
   {
      Prid=1, DistProtocol=eBGP+OSPF, MaxRoutes=500.000, MaxVrfs=500;
   }
   
   ppvpn2547IfCapsTable
   {
      Prid=1, MplsSupport= mplsTunnel, LabelEdgeType= providerEdge;
      Prid=2, MplsSupport= mpls      , LabelEdgeType= customerEdge;
      Prid=3, MplsSupport= nonMpls   , LabelEdgeType= customerEdge;
   }
   
   
-- Framework PIB:
   
   The following tables are defined in the generic framework PIB. 
   The PRIs are set by the PDP and sent to the PE for consistent later 
   configuration.

Internet Draft     draft-yacine-ppvpn-2547bis-pib-00.txt      April 2002
   
   
   The framework Capability Set table [FRWK-PIB] defines the different 
   interface types in terms of the BGP/MPLS VPN capabilities.
   
   frwkIfCapSetTable
   {
      Prid=1, Name= "Edge", Capability= ppvpn2547IfCaps.2;
      Prid=2, Name= "Edge", Capability= ppvpn2547IfCaps.3;
      Prid=4, Name= "Core", Capability= ppvpn2547IfCaps.1;
   }
   
   The framework Role Combination table informs on which interface type 
   each interface belongs to and also affect roles to each interface. 
   One can set a 1:1 relationship between roles and interfaces as shown 
   in the example table bellow.
   
   frwkIfRoleComboTable
   {
      Prid=1, Roles="Site A"  , CapSetName="Edge", IfIndex= 1;
      Prid=2, Roles="Site B"  , CapSetName="Edge", IfIndex= 2;
      Prid=3, Roles="Site C"  , CapSetName="Edge", IfIndex= 3;
      Prid=4, Roles="Backbone", CapSetName="Core", IfIndex= 4;
   }
   
-- BGP/MPLS VPN PIB:
   
   The following tables are also BGP/MPLS VPN specific and realize 
   routes distribution policies between sites. For further details about 
   each PRCs, read the BGP/MPLS VPN PIB definition in the next section.

      Prid=2, Type=import, VrfId=1, Precedence=1, RT="VPN2-Hub",
               Descr="Hub Site VPN2";
   }

           The semantics of this metric are determined by
           the routing-protocol specified in  the  route's
           ppvpn2547RouteProto value. If this metric is not
           used, its value should be set to -1."

9. Acknowledgments 
   
   This PIB builds on all the work that has gone into the BGP/MPLS VPN 
   Management Information Base [MPLS-VPN-MIB].
   
10. Subject Category Considerations 
   
   The numbering space used for the BGP/MPLS VPN PIB, as indicated by 
   the SUBJECT-CATEGORIES clause, will be assigned by the Internet 
   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Notice the numbering space used by 
   SUBJECT-CATEGORIES maps to the Client Type numbering space in [COPS-
   PR]. This relationship is detailed in section 7.1 of [SPPI]. Due 
   to the fact that Client Type value of 1 has already been used by 
   [COPS-RSVP], the numbering space for SUBJECT-CATEGORIES will need to 
   start with the value of 2. 
    
   Other PIB Modules may use the same SUBJECT-CATEGORIES as this 
   BGP/MPLS VPN PIB Module. In such situations, PRC numbering space 
   under a specific SUBJECT-CATEGORIES should be coordinated with 
   existing PIB Modules using the same SUBJECT-CATEGORIES. 
   
   
11. Security Considerations 
   
   The information contained in a PIB when transported by the COPS 
   protocol [COPS-PR] may be sensitive, and its function of 
   provisioning a PEP requires that only authorized communication take

   place.  The use of IPSEC between PDP and PEP, as described in 
   [COPS], provides the necessary protection against these threats.
