Abstract 
    
   This draft specifies a set of Policy Rule Classes (PRC) for the 
   enforcement of an IP traffic engineering policy by COPS-PR ([2])-
   capable routers. Instances of such classes reside in a virtual 
   information store, which is called the IP Traffic Engineering Policy 
   Information Base (IP TE PIB). The corresponding IP TE policy 
   provisioning data are intended for use by the COPS-PR IP TE Client-
   Type([3]), and they complement the PRC classes that have been defined 
   in the Framework PIB ([4]).

1. Introduction 
    
   The deployment of value-added IP services over the Internet has 
   become one of the most competing challenges for service providers, as 
   well as a complex technical issue. 
    
   Within the context of network resource provisioning and allocation, 
   the COPS protocol and its usage for the support of Policy 
   Provisioning is one of the ongoing specification efforts of the 
   Resource Allocation Protocol (rap) Working Group of the IETF that 
   should help service providers in dynamically enforcing IP Traffic 
   Engineering (IP TE) policies. 
    
   An IP traffic engineering policy consists in appropriately 
   provisioning, and allocating/de-allocating, the switching and the 
   transmission resources of an IP network (i.e. the routers and the 
   links that connect these routers, respectively), according to Quality 
   of Service (QoS) requirements (e.g. rate, one-way delay, inter-packet 
   delay variation, etc.) that have been expressed by the customers who 
   can access such resources within the context of a given service 
   subscription procedure ([5]). 
    
   Thus, the enforcement of an IP traffic engineering policy yields the 
   introduction of a high level of automation for the dynamic 
   provisioning of the configuration data that will be taken into 
   account by the routers to select the appropriate IP routes. 
    
   Within the context of this document, the actual enforcement of an IP 
   traffic engineering policy is primarily based upon the activation of 
   both intra- and inter-domain dynamic routing protocols (e.g. [6], 
   [7]) that will be activated in the network to select, install, 
   maintain and possibly withdraw routes that will comply with the 
   above-mentioned QoS requirements and/or specific routing constraints, 
   depending on the type of traffic that will be conveyed along these 
   traffic engineered routes. 
    
   It is therefore necessary to provide the route selection processes 
   with the information that will reflect these QoS requirements, given 
   the dynamic routing protocols support traffic engineering 
   capabilities for the computation of such routes.  
    
   Some of these capabilities are currently being specified in [8] and 
   [9] for the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First, [6]) and the IS-IS 
   (Intermediate System to Intermediate System routing protocol, [10]) 
   interior routing protocols respectively, while there is a comparable

Internet Draft       An IP Traffic Engineering PIB            June 2002 
                                     
                                     
   effort for the BGP4 (Border Gateway Protocol, version 4) protocol, as 
   described in [11], for example. 
    
   To provide the route selection processes with the aforementioned 
   information, one possibility is to use the COPS-PR protocol, together 
   with a collection of policy provisioning data that will be stored in 
   a virtual information store, called a Policy Information Base. 
    
   This draft describes a collection of Policy Rule Classes that will be 
   stored and dynamically maintained in the IP TE PIB. The "rule" and 
   "role" concepts, which have been defined in [12], are adopted by this 
   document to distribute the IP traffic engineering policy provisioning 
   data over the COPS-PR protocol. 
    
   This document is organized as follows: 
    
   - Section 4 introduces some considerations about the scalability of 
     such a dynamic provisioning scheme, 
    
   - Section 5 provides an overview of the organization of the IP TE 
     PIB, 
    
   - Section 6 provides a description of the PRC classes of the IP TE 
     PIB, according to the semantics of the Structure of Policy 
     Provisioning Information (SPPI, [13]). 
    
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [14]. 
    
3. Changes since the previous version 
    
   - The PIB has been slightly reorganized to introduce an additional 
     table for IS-IS-related policy provisioning data according to [9], 
    
   - The introduction has been slightly reworded, 
    
   - The references section has been updated. 
    
4. Scalability considerations 
    
   The usage of the COPS-PR protocol for the dynamic enforcement of an 
   IP traffic engineering policy raises some scalability issues, as far 
   as the volume of configuration information that will be exchanged not 
   only between the routers themselves (because of the OSPF machinery 
   for example), but also between the PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) 
   components embedded in the routers and the PDP (Policy Decision 
   Point) they communicate with is concerned.

   While the concern strictly related to the design of a routing policy 
   is outside the scope of this document, the dynamic provisioning of 
   metric values as well as the reports related to the actual 
   enforcement of decisions taken by the PDP, deserve some elaboration. 
    
4.1. A tentative metric taxonomy 
    
   The metrics that will be taken into account by the Shortest Path 
   First (SPF) algorithms for IP TE route calculation can be classified 
   into two basic categories: 
    
     1. Metrics assigned on a long-term basis, which basically consist 
        of the "usual" cost metrics, like those defined in [5]. These 
        metrics are those that are assigned on a (logical) interface 
        basis, and they aim at reflecting the link quality the 
        corresponding interface is attached to,  
    
     2. Metrics assigned on a (very) short term basis, which MAY consist 
        of the following information: 
    
         - The available bandwidth, (e.g. based upon the information 
           provided by SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol, [15]) 
           counters like ifInOctets and ifOutOctets),  
         - The amount of bandwidth that can be reserved,  
         - The amount of reserved bandwidth. 
           
   While "long term" metric values should not change frequently by 
   definition, the "short term" metric values MAY vary like the ongoing 
   usage of the resources of the network. 
    
   Therefore, the dynamic computation of "short term" metric values 
   SHOULD remain in the magnitude of the corresponding SPF computation, 
   since newly assigned values yield the spontaneous generation of LSU 
   (Link State Update, [5]) messages. Thus, the traffic generated by the 
   IP traffic engineering provisioning data SHOULD be minimized 
   according to pre-computation engineering recommendations like those 
   described in [16]. 
    
4.2. Reporting the enforcement of an IP traffic engineering policy 
    
   Likewise, the actual enforcement of policy decisions implies the 
   activation of a reporting mechanism, as described in the COPS-PR 
   specification.  
    
   From this perspective, this draft assumes that the corresponding 
   reports sent by the PEP components of the routers towards the PDP 
   SHOULD include the traffic engineered routes that have been computed 
   by the routers, at least for network planning purposes: the service 
   subscription requests will be negotiated according to the knowledge 
   of the network resources that are actually available, and this 
   information includes the routes that could very well service the 
   aforementioned requirements, without any extra computation.

Internet Draft       An IP Traffic Engineering PIB            June 2002 
                                     
                                     
    
   Therefore, the traffic generated by the notification reports of the 
   installed routes SHOULD remain in the magnitude of the route 
   announcement procedures of the IP routing protocols machineries (like 
   OSPF), and it is assumed that the volume of the corresponding COPS-PR 
   traffic is also highly dependent on the pre-computation engineering 
   recommendations that have been mentioned in the above section 3.1.  
    
   In other words, this draft assumes that it is mainly the 
   responsibility of a network operator to enforce an IP traffic 
   engineering policy that should raise scalability issues (raised by 
   design), NOT the choice of activating the COPS-PR protocol as a means 
   to convey the corresponding IP TE provisioning data. 
    
   Nevertheless, it is obviously one of the most important concerns of 
   the ongoing specification and development effort that is partly 
   reflected by this draft. In particular, it is the intention of the 
   authors of this draft to later submit a publication that will aim at 
   depicting the simulation results obtained through the validation of 
   this COPS-PR architecture for the dynamic enforcement of an IP 
   traffic engineering policy within the context of an operational 
   service provider's environment.  
    
5. PIB Overview 
    
   The dynamic enforcement of an IP traffic engineering policy relies on 
   the activation of intra- and inter-domain routing protocols that will 
   have the ability to take into account traffic engineering-related 
   information for the computation and the selection of routes, which 
   will comply as much as possible with the QoS requirements that have 
   been contractually defined between customers and service providers. 
    
   This traffic engineering-related information is basically composed of 
   metric values that will aim at reflecting an IP TE policy, as well as 
   the result of the enforcement of such a policy, so that customers and 
   providers can check anytime that the IP service is provisioned with 
   the appropriate (and contractual) levels of quality (which can be 
   expressed in terms of service availability, for example). 
    
   Therefore, the IP TE PIB mainly aims at: 
    
   - Storing and maintaining the configuration information that will be 
     used by the routers to compute and select the routes that will 
     comply with a collection of QoS requirements, such as the one-way 
     maximum transit delay, or the maximum inter-packet delay 
     variation, 
 
   - Storing and maintaining the information related to the traffic 
     engineered routes that have been installed in the routers' 
     Forwarding Information Bases, so that the service providers have 
     the permanent knowledge of the network's resources availability.

Internet Draft       An IP Traffic Engineering PIB            June 2002 
                                     
                                     
   From this perspective, the IP TE PIB is currently organized into the 
   following provisioning classes: 
    
     1. The Forwarding Classes (ipTeFwClasses): the information 
        contained in these classes is meant to provide a detailed 
        description of the traffic-engineered routes. Only one table is 
        defined at the current stage of this draft: the IP TE Route 
        table which describes the information related to TE routes that 
        have been installed by the routers in their FIBs, 
      
     2. The Metrics Classes (ipTeMetricsClasses): the information 
        stored in the tables of this class is meant to provide a 
        description of the metric values that will be taken into 
        account by intra- and inter-domain routing protocols for the 
        computation and the selection of traffic-engineered routes. So 
        far, two groups have been identified: the first group is based 
        upon the traffic engineering extensions of intra-domain routing 
        protocols, the second group is related to QoS-related 
        information that can be conveyed in BGP-4 messages, 
      
     3. The Statistics Classes (ipTeStatsClasses): the information 
        contained in these classes is meant to provide statistic on the 
        enforcement of the TE policies.

7. Security Considerations 
    
   The traffic engineering policy provisioning data as they are 
   described in this PIB will be used for configuring the appropriate 
   network elements that will be involved in the dynamic enforcement of 
   these traffic engineering policies, by means of a COPS-PR 
   communication that will convey this information. 
    
   The function of dynamically provisioning network elements with such 
   configuration information implies that only an authorized COPS-PR 
   communication take place. 
    
   From this perspective, this draft does not introduce any additional 
   security issues other than those that have been identified in the 
   COPS-PR specification, and it is therefore recommended that the IPSec
