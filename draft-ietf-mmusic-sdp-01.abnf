t=<start time>	<stop time>

r=604800 3600 0	90000

    To make announcements more compact,	times may also be given	in units
    of days, hours or minutes.	To allow yearly	or monthly announcements
    (same day each year	or month), units of years and  months  are  also
    allowed.  The syntax for these is a	number immediately followed by a
    single case-sensitive character.  Fractional units are not allowed -
    a smaller unit should be used instead. The following unit specifica-
    tion characters are	allowed:

	    Y -	years (same day	of same	month each repeated year)
	    M -	months (same day of the	month each repeated month)
	    d -	days (86400 seconds)
	    h -	minutes	(3600 seconds)
	    m -	minutes	(60 seconds)
	    s -	seconds	(allowed for completeness but not recommended)

    Thus, the above announcement could have been written:

r=1d 1h	0 25h

z=<adjustment time> <offset> <adjustment time> <offset>	....

     Should it be necessary to schedule	a repeated session which spans a
     change  from  daylight  time  to standard time or vice-versa, it is
     necessary to specify offsets from the base	repeat	times.	This  is
     necessary	because	 different  time  zones	change time at different
     times of day, because different countries change to  or  from  day-
     light  time  on  different	dates, and because some	countries to not
     have daylight saving time at all.

     Thus in order to schedule a session that is at the	same time winter
     and  summer, it must  be possible to specify unambiguously	by whose
     time zone a session  is  scheduled.   To  simplify	 this  task  for
     receivers,	 we allow the sender to	specify	the NTP	time that a time
     zone adjustment happens and the offset from the time when the  ses-
     sion  was	first  scheduled.  The	``z'' field allows the sender to
     specify a list of these adjustment	times and offsets from the  base
     time.

     An	example	might be:

z=2882844526 -1h 2898848070 0

a=cat:<category>
    This attribute gives the dot-separated hierarchical	category of  the
    session.   This  is	to enable a receiver to	filter unwanted	sessions
    by category.  It would probably  have  been	 a  compulsory	separate
    field,  except  for	 its  experimental nature at this time.	 It is a
    session attribute.

a=keywds:<keywords>
    Like the cat attribute, this is to assist  identifying  wanted  ses-
    sions at the receiver.  It is a session attribute.

a=ptime:<packet	time>
    This gives the length of time in  milliseconds  represented	 by  the
    media  in a	packet.	This is	probably only meaningful for audio data.
    It should not be necessary to know ptime to	decode RTP or vat  audio
    -  it is intended as a recommendation for the encoding/packetisation
    of audio.  It is a media attribute.

a=recvonly
    This specifies that	the tools should be started in receive only mode
    where applicable. It can be	either a session or media attribute.

a=sendrecv
    This specifies that	the tools should be started in send and	 receive
    mode.  This	is necessary for interactive conferences with tools such
    as wb which	defaults to receive only mode. It can be either	 a  ses-
    sion or media attribute.

a=sendonly
    This specifies that	the tools should be started in	send-only  mode.
    Typically  this  may be used where a different unicast address is to
    be used for	a traffic destination that for a traffic source.  It can
    be	either	a session or media attribute, but would	normally only be
    used as a media attribute.

a=orient:<whiteboard orientation>
    Normally only used in a whiteboard media specification, this  speci-
    fies  the  orientation  of	a the whiteboard on the	screen.	 It is a
    media attribute.  Permitted	values are `portrait',	`landscape'  and
    `seascape' (upside down landscape).

a=type:<conference type>
    This specifies the type of the  conference.	  Suggested  values  are
    `broadcast',  `meeting',  and `moderated'.	`recvonly' should be the
    default for	`type:broadcast' sessions, `type:meeting'  should  imply
    `sendrecv' and `type:moderated' should imply the use of a floor con-
    trol tool and that the media tools are started so as to ``mute'' new
    sites joining the conference.  It is a session attribute.

a=charset:<character set>
    This specifies the character set to	be used	to display  the	 session
    name  and information data.	 By default, an	ISO 8859-1 character set
    is used.  If an ISO	8859-1 character set is	not suitable, the use of
    unicode  (ISO  10646,  [6],[7]), as	specified in RFC1641 [8] is sug-
    gested.  In	particular, the	UTF-7 (RFC1642,	[9])  encoding	is  sug-
    gested with	the following SDP attribute:

a=charset:unicode-1-1-utf-7

a=type:moderated
