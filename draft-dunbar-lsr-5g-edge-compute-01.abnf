              CP-i * Load-b                Pref-i * Network-Delay-b


      Load-i: Load Index at Site-i, it is the weighted
      combination of the total packets or/and bytes sent to
      and received from the Application Server at Site-i
      during a fixed time period.

      CP-i: capacity index at site i, a higher value means
      higher capacity.

      Network Delay-i: Network latency measurement (RTT) to
      the A-ER that has the Application Server attached at the
      site-i.
      Noted: Ingress nodes can easily measure RTT to all the
      egress edge nodes by existing IPPM metrics. But it is
      not so easy for ingress nodes to measure RTT to all the
      App Servers. Therefore, "Network-Delay-i", a.k.a.
      Network latency measurement (RTT), is between the
      Ingress and egress edge nodes. The link cost between the
      egress edge nodes to their attached servers is embedded
      in the "capacity index".

      Pref-i: Preference index for site-i, a higher value
      means higher preference. Preference can be derived from
      the total path cost to reach the A-ER [RFC5305], as
      calculated below: 1/(total-path-cost).


Type=TBD2 (to be assigned by IANA) indicates that the
Index=w1*ToPackets+w2*FromPackes+w3*ToBytes+w4*FromBytes

Type= TBD3 (to be assigned by IANA) indicates that the
type =3] specified by Section 12.4 of the [RFC2328].
