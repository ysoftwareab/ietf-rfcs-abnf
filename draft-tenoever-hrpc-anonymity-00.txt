             Anonymity, Human Rights and Internet Protocols
                    draft-tenoever-hrpc-anonymity-00

Abstract

   Anonymity is less discussed topic in the IETF than for instance
   security [RFC3552] or privacy [RFC6973].  This can be attributed to
   the fact anonymity is a hard technical problem or that anonymizing
   user data is not of specific market interest.  It remains a fact that
   'most internet users would like to be anonymous online at least
   occasionally' [Pew].

   This document aims to break down the different meanings and
   implications of anonymity on a mediated computer network.

1.  Introduction

   There seems to be a clear need for anonymity when harassment on the
   Internet on the increase [Pew2] and the UN Special Rapporteur for
   Freedom of Expression call anonymity 'necessary for the exercise of
   the right to freedom of opinion and expression in the digital age'
   [UNHRC2015].

   Nonetheless anonymity is not getting much discussion at the IETF,
   providing anonymity does not seem a (semi-)objective for many
   protocols, even though several documents contribute to improving
   anonymity such as [RFC7258], [RFC7626], [RFC7858].

   There are initiatives on the Internet to improve end users anonymity,
   most notably [torproject], but this all relies on adding encryption
   in the application layer.

   This document aims to break down the different meanings and
   implications of anonymity on a mediated computer network and to see
   whether (some parts of) anonymity should be taken into consideration
   in protocol development.

2.  Vocabulary Used

   Concepts in this draft currently strongly hinges on [AnonTerm]

   Anonymity  A state of an individual in which an observer or attacker
      cannot identify the individual within a set of other individuals
      (the anonymity set).  [RFC6973]

Internet-Draft                    anon                     February 2017


   Linkability  Linkability of two or more items of interest (IOIs,
      e.g., subjects, messages, actions, ...) from an attacker's
      perspective means that within the system (comprising these and
      possibly other items), the attacker can sufficiently distinguish
      whether these IOIs are related or not.  [AnonTerm]

   Pseudonymity  Dervided from pseudonym, a persistent identity which is
      not the same as the entity's given name.

   Unlinkability  Unlinkability of two or more items of interest (IOIs,
      e.g., subjects, messages, actions, ...) from an attacker's
      perspective means that within the system (comprising these and
      possibly other items), the attacker cannot sufficiently
      distinguish whether these IOIs are related or not.  [AnonTerm]

   Undetectability  The impossibility of being noticed or discovered

      Undetectability of an item of interest (IOI) from an attacker's
      perspective means that the attacker cannot sufficiently
      distinguish whether it exists or not [AnonTerm]

   Unobservability

      Unobservability of an item of interest (IOI) means:
      undetectability of the IOI against all subjects uninvolved in it
      and

      anonymity of the subject(s) involved in the IOI even against the
      other subject(s) involved in that IOI.  [AnonTerm]

3.  Research Questions

   Premise: activity on the network has the ability for is to be
   anonymous or authenticated

   While analyzing protocols for their impact on users anonymity, would
   it make sense to ask the following questions:

   1.  How anonymous is the end user to:

       o  local network operator

       o  other networks you connect to

       o  your communications peer on the other end of the pipe

   2.  How well can they distinguish my identity from somebody else
       (with a similar communication) (ie linkability)

   3.  How does the protocol impact pseudonomity?

       o  in case of long term pseudonymity

       o  in case of short term pseudonymity

   4.  How does the protocol, in conjunction with other protocols,
       impact pseudonymity?

   5.  Could there be advice for prootocol developers and implementers
       to improve anonimity and pseudonymity?

4.  Use Cases

   -  multiple identities concurrently used, mixing them in operations /
      keeping them distinct (talking to XMPP, alias, etc)

   -  when you change identity, do cross stack analysis, so you have no
      bleedover, anonymity on a cross protocol, cross stack level

5.  Security Considerations

   As this draft concerns a research document, there are no security
   considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
