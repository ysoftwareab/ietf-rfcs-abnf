Abstract

This document mainly talks about Chinese characters and two proposed 
schemes of implemention based on [IDNREQ] and [NAMEPREP],though 
there are some differences among them.The distinction between these two schemes 
is the position of the implementation function:
    -- client side processing 
or 
    -- server side processing

In China, the most popular character set are [GBK],[BIG5],[GB18030],while
in this document,all examples are based on [UCS].


1.  Charateristics of Chinese characters and Chinese languange
1.1 The context dependent semantics of Chinese characters 
    In [UCS],each Chinese character is a codepoint,which is composed of two
    bytes.
    
    Chinese character can be classified as two groups. In one group,each
    character does its own meaning(notional character) while that of the
    other group has not(empty characters). Both notional characters and
    empty characters can be made words by combining with other 
    character(s),even sentences. the notional character 
    is the basic unit of Chinese language which has meaning similar to phonems.
    
1.2 A Chinese characters may have several writing forms.
    
    Chinese characters were continuously evolved and widely spread during
    5,000-year-long Chinese history. They were also largely introduced 
    into other countries and became a major component of their languages.
    Therefore, it is inevitably for a Chinese character has many other
    writing forms. In Unicode encoding standards, the criterion for
    distributing codepoint is the shape of character. So the different 
    glyph of the same Chinese character have several different 
    codepoint according to the international encoding standard.
    
    Currently,there are two forms of writing Chinese character:
      -- simplified character(SC): mainland of China
      -- traditional character(TC): Taiwan,Hongkong,Macao
    
    Except for some special writing forms of certain character, their 
    meaning had also been changed in the long history. Generally different
    writing forms of a Chinese character can substituted by each other 
    without changing the meaning of the word(phrase).    
 
   
1.3 The Usage of Appellation in China
    In China, Generally speaking,every companies,organizations and people
    have two names: full name and abbreviation.
    
    The abbreviated name is easy to remember and to communicate.The full
    name is a formal name which is used in formal document,situation.
    
    To the name owners,the two names are equal necessary and important. 
    So,in domain name registration,they usually register both full name 
    and the corresponding abbreviations in order to permit people to access
    the same domain name by typing the full name or the abbreviatied name.
    Some of the full names are quite long,that's why the length of domain 
    name is important for Chinese user.


2. Chinese characters in DNS
1.1 Traditional and Simplified Chinese Conversion has 3 forms:
    1-1 mapping: one traditional character(TC) maps to ONLY one simplified
                 characer(SC).
    1-n mapping: one TC has several SC writing forms	
    n-1 mapping: one SC has several forms of TC

1.2 Delimiter folding
    The full stop in chinese is "нъ". Therefore, the "нъ" in CDNS is equal 
    to the dot "." as the delimiter.

1.3 Label sequence
   Currently,the label sequence of LDH domain name is from left to right,
   (e.g.:abc.def.ghi.net),the subdomain is to the left and the superset 
   of the subdomain is to the right.
   
   In China,user has reverse convention of language. Considering the 
   culture different between the east and the west, it's necessary for
   people to access the Internet with the convention of using their native
   languages.for example:
   
        abc.com.cn 
   perfer to :
        cn.com.abc
