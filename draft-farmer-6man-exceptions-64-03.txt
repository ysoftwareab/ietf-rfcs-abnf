   IPv6 addressing.  The exceptions include unicast IPv6 addresses with
   the first three bits 000, manually configured addresses, DHCPv6
   assigned addresses, IPv6 on-link determination, and the possibility
   of an exception specified in separate IPv6 link-type specific
   documents.  Further, operational guidance is provided, and Appendix A
   discusses the valid options for configuring IPv6 subnets.

1.  Introduction

   The standard subnet boundary in IPv6 addressing provides the basis
   for unicast addresses to be autonomously generated using stateless
   address auto-configuration (SLAAC) [RFC4862].  SLAAC allows hosts to
   connect to link networks without any pre-configuration, which is
   especially useful for general-purpose hosts and mobile devices.  In
   this circumstance, unicast addresses have an internal structure
   composed of standard 64-bit interface identifiers (IIDs) and
   therefore 64-bit subnet prefixes, as defined in the IPv6 Addressing
   Architecture [RFC4291bis].  For additional discussion of the standard
   subnet boundary in IPv6 addressing see RFC 7421 [RFC7421].

   However, in other circumstances, such as with manually configured
   addresses or DHCPv6 [RFC3315] assigned addresses, unicast addresses
   are assigned to interfaces on nodes as opaque 128-bit quantities
   without any knowledge of the internal structure or the subnets
   present on the link network.  The idea that unicast addresses may
   have no internal structure is also defined in IPv6 Addressing
   Architecture [RFC4291bis], "a node may consider that unicast
   addresses (including its own) have no internal structure."

   Further, unlike IPv4 where there is a single subnet mask parameter
   with the two aspects of a subnet, address assignment and on-link



Farmer                  Expires February 4, 2019                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft   Exceptions to the IPv6 Subnet Boundary      August 2018


   determination, tightly coupled together, whereas, in IPv6 these two
   aspects are split into two logically separate parameters serving the
   two aspects independently.  The subnet assignment prefix is used for
   performing autonomous address assignment by SLAAC.  Separately, the
   on-link prefix is used to determine if an address can be delivered
   using a directly connected link network.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
   (ND) [RFC4861], the IPv6 subnet model [RFC5942], and SLAAC [RFC4862]
   describe and specify the use of these parameters in detail.

   Briefly, unicast addresses assigned to interfaces on hosts are not
   considered on-link unless covered by an on-link prefix advertised
   through ND Router Advertisement (RA) messages containing Prefix
   Information Options (PIOs) with the on-link (L) flag set or by manual
   configuration.  Whereas autonomous address assignment uses subnet
   assignment prefixes that are also advertised through the same ND RA
   messages and PIOs but with the autonomous (A) flag set instead.
   While they act independently, most frequently subnets are configured
   using subnet assignment prefixes with identical on-link prefixes, see
   Appendix A for a further decision of this and the other valid options
   for configuring IPv6 subnets.  However, unlike subnet assignment
   prefixes, which are effectively required to be 64 bits in length,
   on-link prefixes may have any length between 0 and 128 bits,
   inclusive.  Nevertheless, for consistency with the standard subnet
   boundary, 64-bit on-link prefix lengths are recommended in most
   circumstances.

   Reinforcing the ideas that on-link prefixes are logically separate
   and may have any length.  On-link prefixes are part of the next-hop
   determination process, discussed in IPv6 ND [RFC4861] section 5.2,
   which is intrinsically part of routing and forwarding within IPv6,
   and BCP 198 [RFC7608] says, "forwarding processes MUST be designed to
   process prefixes of any length up to /128, by increments of 1."

   Finally, SLAAC is currently designed to utilize a single IID length
   to validate the length of the subnet assignment prefixes provided to
   it.  However, SLAAC itself does not define the IID length or assume
   it is 64 bits in length.  It utilizes the IID length defined in
   separate link-type specific documents that are intended to be
   consistent with the standard 64-bit IID length specified in the IPv6
   Addressing Architecture [RFC4291bis].  While this is a possible
   exception to the standard subnet boundary, currently there are no
   IPv6 link-type specific documents that specify an IID length other
   than 64 bits.  Effectively requiring 64-bit IIDs and therefore 64-bit
   subnet assignment prefixes used for performing autonomous address
   assignment by SLAAC.

   In summary, the essential theory of this document is that the two
   parameters that define IPv6 subnets, the subnet assignment prefix and

Internet-Draft   Exceptions to the IPv6 Subnet Boundary      August 2018


   the on-link prefix, interact with the standard subnet boundary in
   subtle but complex ways.  IPv6 subnets are primarily configured using
   subnet assignment prefixes and when they are used IPv6 subnets and
   IIDs are both effectively required to be 64 bits in length.  However,
   it is also possible to configure IPv6 subnets solely using on-link
   prefixes, which may have any length between 0 and 128 bits,
   inclusive.  Nevertheless, for consistency with the standard subnet
   boundary, 64-bit on-link prefix lengths are recommended in most
   circumstances.  Therefore, when IPv6 subnets are configured solely
   using on-link prefixes, IPv6 subnets and IIDs are both only
   recommended to be 64 bits in length.

   By clarifying the following exceptions to the standard subnet
   boundary and providing clear operational guidance, this document
   intends to provide clarity to and a better understanding of this
   subtle but complex interaction between the standard subnet boundary
   in IPv6 addressing and how IPv6 subnets are defined and implemented
   by the protocols in question.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Exceptions to the Standard Subnet Boundary

2.1.  Unicast Addresses with the First Three Bits 000

   These are all currently special-purpose IPv6 addresses or are
   otherwise reserved.  Also, they are generally not assigned to
   interfaces on hosts, especially not to general-purpose hosts.
   Examples of these addresses are the unspecified address, the loopback
   address, and the IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address from RFC 4291bis sections
   2.4.2, 2.4.3, 2.4.5.2 [RFC4291bis] respectively.

   Most of these addresses have no internal structure and are considered
   opaque 128-bit quantities.  However, some of these addresses could be
   presumed to have structure, such as the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.
   This structure comes from embedding an IPv4 address within an IPv6
   address, but this structure is unrelated to and different from the
   internal structure, composed of standard IIDs and subnets created by
   the standard subnet boundary.

   Historically, reservations were also made in this range for the
   mapping of OSI NSAP and IPX address into IPv6 addresses.  They had

Internet-Draft   Exceptions to the IPv6 Subnet Boundary      August 2018


   structures similar to the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address discussed above.
   However, they have since been deprecated.

      Note: ever since RFC 2373 [RFC2373] addresses with the first three
      bits 000 have been an exception to the 64-bit boundary, and
      addresses with the first three bits 001 through 111, except for
      multicast addresses, have been expected to be consistent with the
      standard 64-bit IID length.

2.2.  Manually Configured Addresses

   IPv6 addresses manually configured on a node's interface, sometimes
   known as statically configured, are an exception to the standard
   subnet boundary as they are considered opaque 128-bit quantities and
   are assigned to node interfaces without any knowledge of the internal
   structure or the subnets present on the link network.

   Manually configured addresses MAY also include an associated on-link
   prefix length.  This on-link prefix length (n) MAY have any value
   between 0 and 128 bits, inclusive.  If an on-link prefix length is
   included, the most significant, or leftmost, n bits of the manually
   configured address are considered the on-link prefix.  Otherwise, if
   an on-link prefix length is not included, an on-link prefix MUST NOT
   be automatically assumed, but an on-link prefix may be learned from a
   PIO with the L flag set.  Nevertheless, for consistency with the
   standard subnet boundary, 64-bit on-link prefix lengths are
   recommended in most circumstances.  See section 3 for operational
   guidance regarding on-link prefix lengths.

2.3.  DHCPv6 Assigned Addresses

   IPv6 addresses assigned to a host's interface via DHCPv6 [RFC3315]
   (Identity Association for Non-temporary Addresses (IA_NA) or Identity
   Association for Temporary Addresses (IN_TA)) are an exception to the
   standard subnet boundary as they are considered opaque 128-bit
   quantities and are assigned to host interfaces without any knowledge
   of the internal structure or the subnets present on the link network.
   Further, DHCPv6 assigned addresses MUST NOT automatically assume an
   on-link prefix, but an on-link prefix may be learned from a PIO with
   the L flag set.

2.4.  IPv6 On-link Determination

   IPv6 on-link determination is an exception to the standard subnet
   boundary, in that IPv6 ND [RFC4861] does not require on-link prefixes
   to be 64 bits in length.  To the contrary, on-link prefixes MAY have
   any length between 0 and 128 bits, inclusive.  Nevertheless, for
   consistency with the standard subnet boundary, 64-bit on-link prefix

Internet-Draft   Exceptions to the IPv6 Subnet Boundary      August 2018


   lengths are recommended in most circumstances.  See section 3 for
   detailed operational guidance regarding the use of on-link prefix
   lengths.

2.5.  IPv6 Link-type Specific Documents

   Separate IPv6 link-type specific documents, sometimes known as
   "IPv6-over-FOO" documents, specify the IID length utilized by SLAAC
   to validate the length of subnet assignment prefixes provided.  This
   IID length defined SHOULD be consistent with the standard 64-bit IID
   length specified in the IPv6 Addressing Architecture [RFC4291bis].
   However, these documents may create an exception to the standard
   64-bit IID length scoped to a specific link-type technology when
   justified.  Although currently, there are no IPv6 link-type specific
   documents that specify an IID length other than 64 bits.

   When an exception to the standard 64-bit IID is specified in a
   link-type specific document, valid justification needs to be
   documented in some detail.

   Further, SLAAC is currently designed to validate against only a
   single IID length per link-type technology.  As a result, a link-type
   technology that specifies a non-standard IID length cannot be
   directly bridged with another link-type technology that specifies the
   standard 64-bit IID length without creating confusion about the IID
   length that is to be used for validation.  Therefore, if this type of
   direct bridging is allowed, then a mechanism to ensure there is no
   confusion about which IID length SLAAC is to validate against needs
   to be provided.

3.  Operational Guidance

   At a high-level, this document recommends the following principles
   for the configuration of IPv6 subnets.  The configuration of subnet
   assignment prefixes is recommended, allowing hosts to use autonomous
   address assignment.  With this configuration, subnet assignment
   prefixes are required to be 64 bits in length, requiring 64-bit
   subnets in this circumstance.  Further, identical on-link prefixes
   are recommended, but on-link prefixes are required to be 64 bits or
   shorter.  Otherwise, if a subnet assignment prefix is not configured,
   then hosts will have to use manually configured addresses or DHCPv6
   assigned addresses and these subnets are solely configured by the
   on-link prefixes.  These on-link prefixes are recommended to be 64
   bits in length, therefore only recommending 64-bit subnets in this
   circumstance.  There are two exceptions to these principles, the
   possible future specification of a link-type specific document based
   on an IID length that is not 64 bits and inter-router point-to-point
   links with 127-bit prefixes [RFC6164].

Internet-Draft   Exceptions to the IPv6 Subnet Boundary      August 2018


   More formally;

      Network operators SHOULD configure routers to advertise to each
      link network at least one subnet assignment prefix (a PIO with the
      A flag set).  If a subnet assignment prefix is advertised, it MUST
      be (128 -) N bits in length and an identical on-link prefix (a PIO
      with the L flag set) SHOULD also be advertised.  If an on-link
      prefix is advertised and is covered by a subnet assignment prefix,
      the on-link prefix MUST NOT be longer than (128 - N) bits in
      length.

      Otherwise, if a subnet assignment prefix is not advertised,
      network operators SHOULD configure routers to advertise to each
      link network at least one on-link prefix (a PIO with the L flag
      set) that is (128 - N) bits in length or provide the same manually
      configured on-link prefix to each host on the link network that is
      (128 - N) bits in length.

      Where N = 64, unless the link-type specific document for the link
      in question specifies a non-standard IID length, in which case N
      is the IID length specified by that document.

      Alternatively, network operators MAY configure point-to-point
      router links with 127-bit on-link prefixes, typically by manual
      configuration, and with no subnet assignment prefix, see RFC 6164
      [RFC6164].

   Appendix A discusses in further detail the valid options for
   configuring IPv6 subnets.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document clarifies exceptions to the standard subnet boundary in
   IPv6 addressing.  These clarifications are not security related and
   therefore are not expected to introduce any new security
   considerations.

   The use of subnets solely configured by on-link prefixes negatively
   impacts techniques that are intended to increase the security and
   privacy of users RFC 4941 [RFC4941] and RFC 7217 [RFC7217], as they
   depend on the use of SLAAC, hence the recommendation to configure
   subnet assignment prefixes.  Further, the use of subnets solely
   configured by on-link prefixes also permits longer on-link prefixes
   effectively allowing smaller subnets and making it more feasible to

   perform IPv6 address scans.  These and other related security and
   privacy considerations are discussed in RFC 7707 [RFC7707] and
   RFC 7721 [RFC7721].

   However, the use of smaller subnets can be effective mitigation for
   neighbor cache exhaustion issues as discussed in RFC 6164 [RFC6164]
   and RFC 6583 [RFC6583].  The relative weights applied in this trade-
   off will vary from situation to situation.

Appendix A.  Options for Configuring IPv6 Subnets

   As discussed in the Introduction, IPv6 subnets are defined by two
   separate parameters, acting independently, the subnet assignment
   prefix and the on-link prefix.  It is possible to configure these
   parameters with several different relationships to each other.  These
   parameters are primarily advertised in ND RA messages by PIOs, with
   the A and L flags designating the purpose of the PIO.  However,
   on-link prefixes may also be manually configured.

   SLAAC [RFC4862] section 5.5.3 bullet d, validates subnet assignment
   prefixes against the IID length specified in separate link-type
   specific documents that are intended to be consistent with the

   standard 64-bit IID length.  Currently, there are no link-type
   specific documents that specify a non-standard IID length.  Therefore
   subnet assignment prefixes are effectively required to be 64 bits in
   length.  Further, to simplify the following discussion the
   possibility that a link-type specific document could specify a
   non-standard IID length is ignored.

   Whereas on-link prefixes have no such validation specified in IPv6 ND
   [RFC4861], this is also confirmed in SLAAC [RFC4862] section 5.5.3
   bullet d.  Therefore on-link prefixes are not required to be 64 bits
   in length; they may have any length between 0 and 128 bits,
   inclusive.  Nevertheless, for consistency with the standard subnet
   boundary, 64-bit on-link prefixes lengths are recommended, except for
   inter#8209;router point#8209;to#8209;point links with 127#8209;bit
   prefixes.

   The following are the valid options for configuring the two
   parameters that define an IPv6 subnet;

   1.  Subnet assignment prefixes with identical on-link prefixes
   2.  Subnet assignment prefixes with shorter covering on-link prefixes
   3.  Only subnet assignment prefixes with no on-link prefixes
   4.  Only on-link prefixes with no subnet assignment prefixes

   Options 1 through 3, all define subnet assignment prefixes,
   designating the use of autonomous address assignment, performed by
   SLAAC, and effectively requiring subnets that are 64 bits in length.
   However, manually configured addresses or DHCPv6 assigned addresses
   may also be used in addition to autonomous address assignment.

   Option 1 is both the most frequently used and the only recommended
   option, except for inter-router point-to-point links with 127-bit
   prefixes, it has identical subnet assignment prefixes and on-link
   prefixes of 64 bits in length.  The 64-bit subnets used for
   autonomous address assignment are considered to be on-link.  This
   option is particularly recommended for networks that are made
   available to the general public or networks that intend to connect
   general-purpose hosts or mobile devices.

   Option 2 is not recommended, but is still a valid configuration; it
   has on-link prefixes shorter than 64 bits, between 0 and 63 bits,
   inclusive, but covering the subnet assignment prefixes included.  The
   64-bit subnets used for autonomous address assignment are considered
   on-link, along with other numerically adjacent subnets.  However,
   these other numerically adjacent subnets are not used for autonomous
   address assignment unless additional separate 64-bit subnet
   assignment prefixes are also included.

   Option 3 is not recommended, but is still a valid configuration; it
   has subnet assignment prefixes but no on-link prefixes.  Therefore
   the 64-bit subnets used for autonomous address assignment are not
   considered on-link, and all traffic for the subnets, including host-
   to-host traffic, must be sent to a default router.  See RFC 8273
   [RFC8273] for an example of this option.

   Option 4 is not recommended, but is still a valid configuration; it
   has on-link prefixes, but no subnet assignment prefixes, and
   therefore manually configured addresses or DHCPv6 assigned addresses
   must be used.  The on-link prefixes may have any length between 0 and
   128 bits, inclusive.  However, 64-bit on-link prefixes are
   recommended, except for inter-router point-to-point links with
   127-bit prefixes.  This option effectively results in subnets that
   are defined only by the on-link prefixes, and therefore the subnets
   may have any lengths, even though 64 bits is recommended.

   Furthermore, Option 4 essentially allows for the use of subnets
   longer than 64 bits.  While this violates the spirit of the standard
   subnet boundary, technically it is not a violation of the standard
   subnet boundary; manually configured addresses, DHCPv6 assigned
   addresses, and on-link determination are all exceptions to the
   standard subnet boundary defined in this document.  Nevertheless, for
   consistency with the standard subnet boundary, 64-bit on-link prefix
   lengths are recommended, effectively recommending 64-bit subnets,
   except for inter-router point-to-point links with 127-bit prefixes.

   There can be operationally valid reasons for configuring subnets
   longer than 64 bits, and when a subnet is solely configured by an
   on-link prefix, longer subnets while not recommended are not
   prohibited either.  RFC 6164 [RFC6164] explicitly allows 127-bit
   prefixes for inter-router point-to-point links.  Hence the explicit
   exceptions included for it.  Additionally, RFC 6583 [RFC6583]
   discusses "sizing subnets to reflect the number of addresses actually
   in use" as an operational mitigation for neighbor cache exhaustion
   issues.  RFC 7421 section 3 [RFC7421] discusses these issues in more
   detail, but there could be other reasons as well.  Nevertheless,
   address conservation by itself is never considered a valid reason for
   configuring subnets longer than 64 bits.  Accordingly, if a site
   needs additional subnets, additional 64-bit subnets are expected to
   be provided.

   When DHCPv6 is used a DHCPv6 server or DHCPv6 relay will also be
   needed on the link network.  Further, the managed address
   configuration (M) flag in IPv6 ND RA messages signals to hosts that
   DHCPv6 should be used for IPv6 address assignment and the other
   configuration (O) flag signals that other configuration information
   is available via DHCPv6.  However, some hosts do not implement DHCPv6

   and other hosts do not provide a mechanism for manually configuring
   an address on an interface.  Hosts that implement neither, that only
   implement SLAAC, do exist and do not operate on subnets configured
   based on Option 4 regardless of the length of the on-link prefix
   configured.

   It is possible to simultaneously configure multiple different
   subnets, associated with a single link network, each based on the
   same or different options described above.  For example, there could
   be two different subnets based on Option 1 and one based on Option 4,
   all associated the same link network.

   Logically there is another option that could define a subnet, "Subnet
   assignment prefixes with longer covered on-link prefixes," but it
   does not result in an operationally valid subnet.  While SLAAC and ND
   accept this configuration, it is particularly problematic and is
   considered an invalid configuration by the operational guidance
   provided in section 3.  It would have on-link prefixes longer than 64
   bits, between 65 and 128 bits, inclusive, that are covered by an
   included 64-bit subnet assignment prefix.  This configuration results
   in the 64-bit subnet used for autonomous address assignment being
   inconsistently considered on-link for some address and not on-link
   for other addresses within the same subnet.  This inconsistency
   creates a performance differential between addresses within the same
   subnet, which is inefficient and difficult to troubleshoot.
