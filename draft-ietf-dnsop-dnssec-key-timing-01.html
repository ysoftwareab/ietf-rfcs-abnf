Key Rolling Considerations</h3>

<p>When a zone is secured with DNSSEC, the zone manager must
        be prepared to replace ("roll") the keys used in the signing
        process. The rolling of keys may be caused by compromise of
        one or more of the existing keys, or it may be due to a
        management policy that demands periodic key replacement for
        security or operational reasons. In order to implement a key
        rollover, the keys need to be introduced into and removed from
        the zone at the appropriate times. Considerations that must be
        taken into account are: 
</p>
<p>
          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>DNSKEY records and associated information (such as
            RRSIG records created with the key or the associated DS
            records) are not only held at the authoritative
            nameserver, they are also cached at client resolvers. The
            data on these systems can be interlinked, e.g. a
            validating resolver may try to validate a signature
            retrieved from a cache with a key obtained separately.
</li>
<li>A query for the key RRset returns all DNSKEY records in
            the zone. As there is limited space in the UDP packet
            (even with EDNS0 support), dead key records must be
            periodically removed. (For the same reason, the number of
            stand-by keys in the zone should be restricted to the
            minimum required to support the key management
            policy.)
</li>
<li>Zone "boot-strapping" events, where a zone is signed
            for the first time, can be common in configurations where
            a large number of zones are being served. Procedures
            should be able to cope with the introduction of keys into
            the zone for the first time as well as "steady-state",
            where the records are being replaced as part of normal
            zone maintenance.
</li>
<li> To allow for an emergency re-signing of the zone as
            soon as possible after a key compromise has been detected,
            stand-by keys (additional keys over and above those used
            to sign the zone) need to be present. 
</li>
</ul><p>
        
</p>
<p>Management policy, e.g. how long a key is used for, also
        needs to be considered. However, the point of key management
        logic is not to ensure that a "rollover" is completed at a
        certain time but rather to ensure that no changes are made to
        the state of keys published in the zone until it is "safe" to
        do so ("safe" in this context meaning that at no time during
        the rollover process does any part of the zone ever go
        bogus). In other words, although key management logic enforces
        policy, it may not enforce it strictly.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
Types of Keys</h3>

<p>Although DNSSEC validation treats all keys equally, <a class='info' href='#RFC4033'>[RFC4033]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arends, R., Austein, R., Larson, M., Massey, D., and S. Rose, &ldquo;DNS Security Introduction and Requirements,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> recognises the broad classification of
        zone-signing keys (ZSK) and key-signing keys (KSK). A ZSK is
        used to authenticate information within the zone; a KSK is
        used to authenticate the key set in the zone. The main
        implication for this distinction concerns the consistency of
        information during a rollover. 
</p>
<p> During operation, a validating resolver must use separate
        pieces of information to perform an authentication. At the
        time of authentication, each piece of information may be in
        the validating resolver's cache or may need to be retrieved
        from the authoritative server. The rollover process needs to
        happen in such a way that at all times through the rollover
        the information is consistent. With a ZSK, the information is
        the RRSIG (plus associated RRset) and the DNSKEY. These are
        both obtained from the same zone. In the case of the KSK, the
        information is the DNSKEY and DS RRset with the latter being
        obtained from a different zone. 
</p>
<p> There are similarities in the rolling of ZSKs and KSKs:
        replace the RRSIG (plus RR) by the DNSKEY and replace the
        DNSKEY by the DS, and the ZSK rolling algorithms are virtually
        the same as the KSK algorithms. However, there are a number of
        differences, and for this reason the two types of rollovers
        are described separately in this document.

ZSK Rollovers</h3>

<p>A ZSK can be rolled in one of three ways:
</p>
<p>
          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Pre-Publication. Described in <a class='info' href='#RFC4641'>[RFC4641]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kolkman, O. and R. Gieben, &ldquo;DNSSEC Operational Practices,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>,
            the new key is introduced into the DNSKEY RRset, leaving
            the existing keys and signatures in place. This state of
            affairs remains in place for long enough to ensure that
            any DNSKEY RRsets cached in client validating resolvers
            contain both keys. At that point signatures created with
            the old key can be replaced by those created with the new
            key, and the old signatures removed. During the re-signing
            process (which may or may not be atomic depending on how
            the zone is managed), it doesn't matter which key an RRSIG
            record retrieved by a client was created with; clients
            with a cached copy of the DNSKEY RRset will have a copy
            containing both the old and new keys.<br />
<br />
 Once the zone contains only signatures
            created with the new key, there is an interval during
            which RRSIG records created with the old key expire from
            client caches. After this, there will be no signatures
            anywhere that were created using the old key, and it can
            can be removed from the DNSKEY RRset. 
</li>
<li>Double-Signature. Also mentioned in <a class='info' href='#RFC4641'>[RFC4641]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kolkman, O. and R. Gieben, &ldquo;DNSSEC Operational Practices,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, this involves introducing the new key
            into the zone and using it to create additional RRSIG
            records; the old key and existing RRSIG records are
            retained. During the period in which the zone is being
            signed (again, the signing process may not be atomic),
            client resolvers are always able to validate RRSIGs: any
            combination of old and new DNSKEY RRset and RRSIG allows
            at least one signature to be validated.<br />
<br />
 Once the signing process is complete and
            enough time has elapsed to allow all old information to
            expire from caches, the old key and signatures can be
            removed from the zone. As before, during this period any
            combination of DNSKEY RRset and RRSIG will allow
            validation of at least one signature.
</li>
<li>Double-RRSIG. Strictly speaking, the use of the term
            "Double-Signature" above is a misnomer as the method is
            not only double signature, it is also double key as
            well. A true Double-Signature method (here called the
            Double-RRSIG method) involves introducing new signatures
            in the zone (while still retaining the old ones) but not
            the new key.<br />
<br />
 Once the signing
            process is complete and enough time has elapsed to ensure
            that all caches that may contain an RR and associated
            RRSIG to have a copy of both signatures, the ZSK is
            changed. After a further interval during which the old
            DNSKEY RRset expires from caches, the old signatures are
            removed from the zone.
</li>
</ul><p>
        
</p>
<p>Of three methods, Double-Signature is the simplest
        conceptually - introduce the new key and new signatures, then
        approximately one TTL later remove the old key and signatures.
        The drawback of this method is a noticeable increase in the
        size of the DNSSEC data, affecting both the overall size of
        the zone and the size of the responses.
</p>
<p>Pre-Publication is more complex - introduce the new key,
        approximately one TTL later sign the records, and
        approximately one TTL after that remove the old key. However,
        the amount of DNSSEC data is kept to a minimum which reduces
        the impact on performance. 
</p>
<p>The Double-RRSIG combines the increase in data volume of
        the Double-Signature method with the complexity of
        Pre-Publication. It has few (if any) advantages and a
        description is only included here for completeness.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
KSK Rollovers</h3>

<p>In the ZSK case the issue for the validating resolver is to
        ensure that it has access to the ZSK that corresponds to a
        particular signature. In the KSK case this can never be a
        problem as the KSK is only used for one signature (that over
        the DNSKEY RRset) and both the key the signature travel
        together. Instead, the issue is to ensure that the KSK is
        trusted.
</p>
<p>Trust in the KSK is either due to the existence of an
        explicitly configured trust anchor in the validating resolver
        or DS record in the parent zone (which is itself trusted). If
        the former, <a class='info' href='#RFC5011'>[RFC5011]<span> (</span><span class='info'>StJohns, M., &ldquo;Automated Updates of DNS Security (DNSSEC) Trust Anchors,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> timings will be needed to
        roll the keys. If the latter, the rollover algorithm will need
        to involve the parent zone in the addition and removal of DS
        records, so timings are not wholly under the control of the
        zone manager.  (The zone manager may elect to include <a class='info' href='#RFC5011'>[RFC5011]<span> (</span><span class='info'>StJohns, M., &ldquo;Automated Updates of DNS Security (DNSSEC) Trust Anchors,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> timings in the key rolling process so as to
        cope with the possibility that the key has also been
        explicitly configured as a trust anchor.)
</p>
<p>It is important to note that this does not preclude the
        development of key rollover logic; in accordance with the goal
        of the rollover logic being able to determine when a state
        change is "safe", the only effect of being dependent on the
        parent is that there may be a period of waiting for the parent
        to respond in addition to any delay the key rollover logic
        requires. Although this introduces additional delays, even
        with a parent that is less than ideally responsive the only
        effect will be a slowdown in the rollover state
        transitions. This may cause a policy violation, but will not
        cause any operational problems.
</p>
<p>Like the ZSK case, there are three methods for rolling a KSK:
</p>
<p>
          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Double-Signature: Also known as Double-DNSKEY, the new
            KSK is added to the DNSKEY RRset which is then signed with
            both the old and new key. After waiting for the old RRset
            to expire from caches, the DS record in the parent zone is
            changed. After waiting a further interval for this change
            to be reflected in caches, the old key is removed from the
            RRset. (The name "Double-Signature" is used because, like
            the ZSK method of the same name, the new key is introduced
            and immediately used for signing.) 
</li>
<li>Double-DS: the new DS record is published. After
            waiting for this change to propagate into the caches of
            all validating resolvers, the KSK is changed. After a
            further interval during which the old DNSKEY RRset expires
            from caches, the old DS record is removed.
</li>
<li>Double-RRset: the new KSK is added to the DNSKEY RRset
            which is then signed with both the old and new key, and
            the new DS record added to the parent zone. After waiting
            a suitable interval for the old DS and DNSKEY RRsets to
            expire from validating resolver caches, the old DNSKEY and
            DS record are removed.
</li>
</ul><p>
        
</p>
<p>In essence, "Double-Signature" means that the new KSK is
        introduced first and used to sign the DNSKEY RRset. The DS
        record is changed, and finally the old KSK removed. With
        "Double-DS" it is the other way around. Finally, Double-RRset
        does both updates more or less in parallel.
</p>
<p>The strategies have different advantages and disadvantages:
</p>
<p>
          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Double-Signature minimizes the number of interactions
            with the parent zone. However, for the period of the
            rollover the DNSKEY RRset is signed with two KSKs, so
            increasing the size of the response to a query for this
            data.
</li>
<li>Double-DS keeps the size of the DNSKEY RRset to a
            minimum, but does require the additional administrative
            overhead of two interactions with the parent to roll a
            KSK.  (Although this can be mitigated if the parent has
            the ability for a child zone to schedule the withdrawal of
            the old key at the same time as the introduction of the
            new one.)
</li>
<li>Finally, Double-RRset allows the rollover to be done in
            roughly half the time of the other two methods; it also
            supports policies that require a period of running with
            old and new KSKs simultaneously. However, it does have the
            disadvantages of both the other two methods - it requires
            two signatures during the period of the rollover and two
            interactions with the parent.

Key States</h3>

<p>During the rolling process, a key moves through different states. These states are:
</p>
<p>
          </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Generated</dt>
<dd>The key has been created, but has
            not yet been used for anything.
</dd>
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd>The DNSKEY record - or information
            associated with it - is published in the zone, but
            predecessors of the key (or associated information) may be
            held in resolver caches.<br />
 The idea
            of "associated information" is used in rollover methods
            where RRSIG or DS records are published first and the
            DNSKEY is changed in an atomic operation. It allows the
            rollover still to be thought of as moving through a set of
            states. In the rest of this section, the term "key" should
            be taken to mean "key or associated information".
</dd>
<dt>Ready</dt>
<dd>The key has been published for long
            enough to guarantee that all caches that might contain a
            copy of the key RRset have a copy that includes this
            key.
</dd>
<dt>Active</dt>
<dd>The key is in the zone and has
            started to be used to sign RRsets or authenticate the
            DNSKEY RRset. Note that when this state is entered, it
            might not be possible for every validating resolver to use
            the key for validation: the zone signing may not have
            finished, or the data might not have reached the resolver
            because of propagation delays and/or caching issues. If
            this is the case, the resolver will have to rely on the
            key's predecessor instead. 
</dd>
<dt>Retired</dt>
<dd>The key is in the zone but a
            successor key has become active. As there may still be
            information in caches that that require use of the key, it
            is being retained until this information expires. 
</dd>
<dt>Dead</dt>
<dd>The key is published in the zone but
            there is no information anywhere that requires its
            presence.
</dd>
<dt>Removed</dt>
<dd>The key has been removed from the
            zone.
</dd>

<p>
          </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Revoked</dt>
<dd>The key is published for a period
            with the "revoke" bit set as a way of notifying validating
            resolvers that have configured it as a trust anchor that
            it is about to be removed from the zone.

<p>Event 1: key N is generated at the generate time
          (Tgen). Although there is no reason why the key cannot be
          generated immediately prior to publication in the zone
          (Event 2), some implementations may find it convenient to
          create a pool of keys in one operation and draw from that
          pool as required. For this reason, it is shown as a separate
          event.  Keys that are available for use but not published
          are said to be generated.
</p>
<p>Event 2: key N's DNSKEY record is put into the zone,
          i.e. it is added to the DNSKEY RRset which is then re-signed
          with the current key-signing key. The time at which this
          occurs is the key's publication time (Tpub), and the key is
          now said to be published.  Note that the key is not yet used
          to sign records. 
</p>
<p>Event 3: before it can be used, the key must be published
          for long enough to guarantee that any resolver that has a
          copy of the DNSKEY RRset from the zone in its cache will
          have a copy of the RRset that includes this key: in other
          words, that any prior cached information about the DNSKEY
          RRset has expired.
</p>
<p>This interval is the publication interval (Ipub) and, for
          the second or subsequent keys in the zone, is given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Ipub = Dprp + TTLkey
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>Here, Dprp is the propagation delay - the time taken for
          any change introduced at the master to replicate to all
          slave servers - which depends on the depth of the
          master-slave hierarchy. TTLkey is the time-to-live (TTL) for
          the DNSKEY records in the zone. The sum is therefore the
          time taken for existing DNSKEY records to expire from the
          caches of downstream validating resolvers, regardless of the
          nameserver from which they were retrieved. 
</p>
<p>In the case of the first key in the zone, Ipub is
          slightly different because it is not information about a
          DNSKEY RRset that may be cached, it is information about its
          absence. In this case:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Ipub = Dprp + Ingc
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>where Ingc is the negative cache interval from the zone's
          SOA record, calculated according to <a class='info' href='#RFC2308'>[RFC2308]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andrews, M., &ldquo;Negative Caching of DNS Queries (DNS NCACHE),&rdquo; March&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>
          as the minimum of the TTL of the SOA record itself (TTLsoa),
          and the "minimum" field in the record's parameters (SOAmin),
          i.e.
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Ingc = min(TTLsoa, SOAmin)
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>After a delay of Ipub, the key is said to be ready and
          could be used to sign records.  The time at which this event
          occurs is the key's ready time (Trdy), which is given
          by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Trdy = Tpub + Ipub
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>Event 4: at some later time, the key starts being used to
          sign RRsets. This point is the active time (Tact) and after
          this, the key is said to be active.
</p>
<p>Event 5: while this key is active, thought must be given
          to its successor (key N+1). As with the introduction of the
          currently active key into the zone, the successor key will
          need to be published at least Ipub before it is
          used. Denoting the publication time of the successor key by
          TpubS, then: 
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>TpubS &lt;= Tact + Lzsk - Ipub
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>Here, Lzsk is the length of time for which a ZSK will be
          used (the ZSK lifetime). It should be noted that unlike the
          publication interval, Lzsk is not determined by timing
          logic, but by key management policy. Lzsk will be set by the
          operator according to their assessment of the risks posed by
          continuing to use a key and the risks associated with key
          rollover. However, operational considerations may mean a key
          is active for slightly more or less than Lzsk. 
</p>
<p>Event 6: while the key N is still active, its successor
          becomes ready. From this time onwards, it could be used to
          sign the zone.
</p>
<p>Event 7: at some point the decision is made to start
          signing the zone using the successor key. This will be when
          the current key has been in use for an interval equal to the
          ZSK lifetime, hence:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Tret = Tact + Lzsk
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>This point in time is the retire time (Tret) of key N;
          after this the key is said to be retired. (This time is also
          the point at which the successor key becomes active.) 
</p>
<p>Event 8: the retired key needs to be retained in the zone
          whilst any RRSIG records created using this key are still
          published in the zone or held in resolver caches. (It is
          possible that a resolver could have an unexpired RRSIG
          record and an expired DNSKEY RRset in the cache when it is
          asked to provide both to a client. In this case the DNSKEY
          RRset would need to be looked up again.) This means that
          once the key is no longer used to sign records, it should be
          retained in the zone for at least the retire interval (Iret)
          given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Iret = Dsgn + Dprp + TTLsig
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>Dsgn is the delay needed to ensure that all existing
          RRsets have been re-signed with the new key. Dprp is (as
          described above) the propagation delay, required to
          guarantee that the updated zone information has reached all
          slave servers, and TTLsig is the TTL of the RRSIG
          records.
</p>
<p>(It should be noted that an upper limit on the retire
          interval is given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Iret = Lsig + Dskw
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>where Lsig is the lifetime of a signature (i.e. the
          interval between the time the signature was created and the
          signature end time), and Dskw is the clock skew - the
          maximum difference in time between the server and a
          validating resolver. The reasoning here is that whatever
          happens, a key only has to be available while any signatures
          created with it are valid. Wherever a signature record is
          held - published in the zone and/or held in a resolver cache
          - it won't be valid for longer than Lsig after it was
          created. The Dskw term is present to account for the fact
          that the signature end time is an absolute time rather than
          interval, and systems may not agree exactly about the
          time.)
</p>
<p>The time at which all RRSIG records created with this key
          have expired from resolver caches is the dead time (Tdea),
          given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Tdea = Tret + Iret
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>...at which point the key is said to be dead.
</p>
<p>Event 9: at any time after the key becomes dead, it can
          be removed from the zone and the DNSKEY RRset re-signed with
          the current key-signing key. This time is the removal time
          (Trem), given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Trem &gt;= Tdea

<p>In the Double-Signature method, both the new key and

<p>Event 1: key N is generated at the generate time
          (Tgen). Although there is no reason why the key cannot be
          generated immediately prior to publication in the zone
          (Event 2), some implementations may find it convenient to
          create a pool of keys in one operation and draw from that
          pool as required. For this reason, it is shown as a separate
          event.  Keys that are available for use but not published
          are said to be generated.
</p>
<p>Event 2: key N is added to the DNSKEY RRset and is
          immediately used to sign the zone; existing signatures in
          the zone are not removed. This is the active time (Tact) and
          the key is said to be active.
</p>
<p>Event 3: at some time later, the predecessor key (key
          N-1) and its signatures can be withdrawn from the zone. (The
          timing of key removal is discussed further in the
          description of event 5.) 
</p>
<p>Event 4: the successor key (key N+1) is introduced into
          the zone and starts being used to sign RRsets. The successor
          is key is now active and the current key (key N) is said to
          be retired. This time is the retire time of the key (Tret);
          it is also the active time of the successor key
          (TactS). 
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Tret = Tact + Lzsk
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>Event 5: before key N can be withdrawn from the zone, all
          RRsets that need to be signed must have been signed by the
          successor key (as a result, all these RRsets are now signed
          twice, once by key N and once by its successor) and the
          information must have reached all validating resolvers that
          may have RRsets from this zone cached. 
</p>
<p>This takes Iret, the retire interval, given by the
          expression:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Iret = Dsgn + Dprp + max(TTLkey, TTLsig)
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>As before, Dsgn is the time taken to sign the zone with
          the new key and Dprp is the propagation delay. The final
          term is the period to wait for old key and signature data to
          expire from caches. After the end of this interval, key N is
          said to be dead. This occurs at the dead time (Tdea) so:

<blockquote class="text">
<p>Tdea = Tret + Iret

<p>Event 1: key N is generated at the generate time
          (Tgen). Although there is no reason why the key cannot be
          generated immediately prior to publication in the zone
          (Event 2), some implementations may find it convenient to
          create a pool of keys in one operation and draw from that
          pool as required. For this reason, it is shown as a separate
          event.  Keys that are available for use but not published
          are said to be generated.
</p>
<p>Event 2: key N is used to sign the zone but existing
          signatures are retained. Although the new ZSK is not
          published in the zone at this point, for analogy with the
          other ZSK rollover methods and because this is the first
          time that key information is visible (albeit indirectly
          through the created signatures) this time is called the
          publish time (Tpub).
</p>
<p>Event 3: after the signing interval, Dsgn, all RRsets
          that need to be signed have been signed by the new key. (As
          a result, all these RRsets are now signed twice, once by the
          existing key and once by the (still-absent) key N.
</p>
<p>Event 4: there is now a delay while the this information
          reaches all validating resolvers that may have RRsets from
          the zone cached. This interval is given by the
          expression:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Dprp + TTLsig
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>...comprising the delay for the information to propagate
          through the nameserver infrastructure plus the time taken
          for signature information to expire from caches.
</p>
<p>Again in analogy with other key rollover methods, this is
          defined as key N's ready time (Trdy) and the key is said to
          be in the ready state. (Although the key is not in the zone,
          it is ready to be used.) The interval between the
          publication and ready times is the publication interval of
          the signature, IpubG, i.e.
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Trdy = Tpub + IpubG
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>IpubG = Dsgn + Dprp + TTLsig
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>Event 5: at some later time the predecessor key is
          removed and the key N added to the DNSKEY RRset. As all the
          RRs have signatures created by the old and new keys, the
          records can still be authenticated. This time is the active
          time (Tact) and the key is now said to be active.
</p>
<p>Event 6: After IpubK - the publication interval of the
          key - the newly added DNSKEY RRset has propagated through to
          all validating resolvers. At this point the old signatures
          can be removed from the zone. IpubK is given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>IpubK = Dprp + TTLkey
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>Event 7: as before, at some later time thought must be
          given to rolling the key. The first step is to publish
          signatures created by the successor key (key N+1) early
          enough so that key N can be replaced after it has been
          active for its scheduled lifetime. This occurs at TpubS (the
          publication time of the successor), given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>TpubS &lt;= Tact + Lzsk - IpubG
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>Event 8: the signatures have propagated through the zone
          and the new key could be added to the zone. This time is the
          ready time of the successor (TrdyS).
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>TrdyS = TpubS + IpubG
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>... where IpubG is as defined above.
</p>
<p>Event 9: at some later time key N is removed from the
          zone and the successor key added.  This is the retire time
          of the key (Tret).
</p>
<p>Event 10: The signatures must remain in the zone for long
          enough that the new DNSKEY RRset has had enough time to
          propagate to all caches. Once caches contain the new DNSKEY,
          the old signatures are no longer of use and can be
          considered to be dead. The time at which this occurs is the
          dead time (Tdea), given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Tdea = Tret + Iret
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>... where Iret is the retire interval, given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Iret = IpubK
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>Event 11: At some later time the signatures can be
          removed from the zone. Although the key has is not longer in
          the zone, this is information associated with it and so the
          time can be regarded as the key's remove time (Trem), given
          by:
</p>

<p>Event 1: key N is generated at time Tgen. As before,
          although there is no reason why the key cannot be generated
          immediately prior to publication, some implementations may
          find it convenient to create a central pool of keys and draw
          from it. For this reason, it is again shown as a separate
          event.
</p>
<p>Event 2: key N is introduced into the zone; it is added
          to the DNSKEY RRset, which is then signed by key N and all
          currently active KSKs. (So at this point, the DNSKEY RRset
          is signed by both key N and its predecessor KSK. If other
          KSKs were active, it is signed by these as well.) This is
          the publication time (Tpub); after this the key is said to
          be published.
</p>
<p>Event 3: before it can be used, the key must be published
          for long enough to guarantee that any validating resolver
          that has a copy of the DNSKEY RRset from the zone in its
          cache will have a copy of the RRset that includes this key:
          in other words, that any prior cached information about the
          DNSKEY RRset has expired.
</p>
<p>The interval is the publication interval (Ipub) and, for
          the second or subsequent KSKs in the zone, is given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Ipub = Dprp + TTLkey
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>... where Dprp is the propagation delay for the zone and
          TTLkey the TTL for the DNSKEY RRset. The time at which this
          occurs is the key's ready time, Trdy, given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Trdy = Tpub + Ipub
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>Event 4: at some later time, the DS RR corresponding to
          the new KSK is submitted to the parent zone for
          publication. This time is the submission time, Tsub. 
</p>
<p>Event 5: the DS record is published in the parent
          zone. As this is the point at which all information for
          authentication - both DNSKEY and DS record - is available in
          the two zones, it is the active time of the key:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Tact = Tsub + Dreg
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>... where Dreg is the registration delay, the time taken
          after the DS record has been received by the parent zone
          manager for it to be placed in the zone. (Parent zones are
          often managed by different entities, and this term accounts
          of the organisational overhead of transferring a
          record.)
</p>
<p>Event 6: at some time later, all validating resolvers
          that have the DS RRset cached will have a copy that includes
          the new DS record. For the second or subsequent DS records,
          this interval is given by the expression:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>DprpP + TTLds
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>... where DprpP is the propagation delay in the parent
          zone and TTLds the TTL assigned to DS records in that
          zone. 
</p>
<p>In the case of the first DS record for the zone in
          question, the expression is slightly different because it is
          not information about a DS RRset that may be cached, it is
          information about its absence. In this case, the interval
          is:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>DprpP + IngcP
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>where IngcP is the negative cache interval from the
          zone's SOA record, calculated according to <a class='info' href='#RFC2308'>[RFC2308]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andrews, M., &ldquo;Negative Caching of DNS Queries (DNS NCACHE),&rdquo; March&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> as the minimum of the TTL of the parent
          SOA record itself (TTLsoaP), and the "minimum" field in the
          record's parameters (SOAminP), i.e.
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>IngcP = min(TTLsoaP, SOAminP)
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>Event 7: while key N is active, thought needs to be given
          to its successor (key N+1).  At some time before the
          scheduled end of the KSK lifetime, the successor KSK is
          introduced into the zone and is used to sign the DNSKEY
          RRset. (As before, this means that the DNSKEY RRset is
          signed by both the current and successor KSK.) This is the
          publication time of the successor key, TpubS.
</p>
<p>Event 8: after an interval Ipub, the successor key
          becomes ready (in that all validating resolvers that have a
          copy of the DNSKEY RRset have a copy of this key). This is
          the successor ready time, TrdyS.
</p>
<p>Event 9: at the successor submission time (TsubS), the DS
          record corresponding to the successor key is submitted to
          the parent zone.
</p>
<p>Event 10: the successor DS record is published in the
          parent zone and the current DS record withdrawn. The current
          key is said to be retired and the time at which this occurs
          is Tret, given by:
</p>
<p>The relationships between these times are:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>TpubS &lt;= Tact + Lksk - Dreg - Ipub
</p>
<p>Tret = Tact + Lksk
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>... where Lksk is the scheduled lifetime of the KSK.
</p>
<p>Event 11: key N must remain in the zone until any
          validators that have the DS RRset cached have a copy of the
          DS RRset containing the new DS record. This interval is the
          retire interval, given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Iret = DprpP + TTLds
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>... where DprpP is the propagation delay in the parent
          zone and TTLds the TTL of a DS record.
</p>
<p>As the key is no longer used for anything, it can also be
          said to be dead, in which case: 
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Tdea = Tret + Iret
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>Event 12: at some later time, key N is removed from the
          zone (at the remove time Trem); the key is now said to be
          removed.
</p>

<p>Event 1: key N is generated at time Tgen. As before,
          although there is no reason why the key cannot be generated
          immediately prior to publication, some implementations may
          find it convenient to create a central pool of keys and draw
          from it. For this reason, it is again shown as a separate
          event.
</p>
<p>Event 2: the DS record corresponding to key N is
          submitted for publication in the parent zone. This time is
          the submission time (Tsub).
</p>
<p>Event 3: after the registration delay, Dreg, the DS
          record is published in the parent zone. This is the
          publication time Tpub, given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Tpub = Tsub + Dreg
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>Event 4: at some later time, any validating resolver that
          has copies of the DS RRset in its cache will have a copy of
          the DS record for key N. At this point, key N, if introduced
          into the DNSKEY RRset, could be used to validate the
          zone. For this reason, this time is known as the key's ready
          time, Trdy, and is given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Trdy = Tpub + IpubP
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>IpubP is the parent publication interval and is given by
          the expression:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>IpubP = DprpP + TTLds
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>... where DprpP is the propagation delay in the parent
          zone and TTLds the TTL assigned to DS records in that
          zone. 
</p>
<p>Event 5: at some later time, the key rollover takes
          place. The predecessor key is withdrawn from the DNSKEY
          RRset and the new key (key N) introduced and used to sign
          the RRset.
</p>
<p>As both DS records have been in the parent zone long
          enough to ensure that they are in the cache of any
          validating resolvers that have the DS RRset cached, the zone
          can be authenticated throughout the rollover - either the
          resolver has a copy of the DNSKEY RRset (and associated
          RRSIGs) authenticated by the predecessor key, or it has a
          copy of the updated RRset authenticated with the new
          key.
</p>
<p>This time is the key's active time (Tact) and at this
          point the key is said to be active.
</p>
<p>Event 6: at some point thought must be given to key
          replacement. The DS record for the successor key must be
          submitted to the parent zone at a time such that when the
          current key is withdrawn, any validating resolver that has
          DS records in its cache will have data about the DS record
          of the successor key. The time at which this occurs is the
          submission time of the successor, given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>TsubS &lt;= Tact + Lksk - IpubP - Dreg
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>... where Lksk is the lifetime of the KSK.
</p>
<p> Event 7: the successor key (key N+1) enters the ready
          state i.e. its DS record is now in the caches of all
          validating resolvers that have the parent DS RRset
          cached. (This is the ready time of the successor,
          TrdyS.)
</p>
<p> Event 8: when the current key has been active for its
          lifetime (Lksk), the current key is removed from the DNSKEY
          RRset and the successor key added; the RRset is then signed
          with the successor key. This point is the retire time of the
          key, Tret, given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Tret = Tact + Lksk
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>Event 9: at some later time, all copies of the old DNSKEY
          RRset have expired from caches and the old DS record is no
          longer needed. This is called the dead time, Tdea, and is
          given by: 
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Tdea = Tret + Iret
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p> ... where Iret is the retire interval, given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Iret = Dprp + TTLkey
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>As before, this term includes the time taken to propagate
          the RRset change through the master-slave hierarchy and the
          time take for the DNSKEY RRset to expire from caches.
</p>
<p>Event 10: at some later time, the DS record is removed
          from the parent zone. This is the removal time (Trem), given
          by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>

<p>Trem &gt;= Tdea

Double-RRset Method</h3>

<p>In the Double-RRset method, both the DS and DNSKEY
          records are changed at the same time, so for a period the
          zone can be authenticated with either key. The advantage of
          this method is its applicability in cases where zone
          management policy requires overlap of authentication keys
          during a roll.

<p>Event 1: key N is created at time Tgen and thereby
          immediately becomes generated. As before, although there is
          no reason why the key cannot be generated immediately prior
          to publication, some implementations may find it convenient
          to create a central pool of keys and draw from it. For this
          reason, it is again shown as a separate event.
</p>
<p>Event 2: the key is added to and used for signing the
          DNSKEY RRset and is thereby published in the zone. At the
          same time the corresponding DS record is submitted to the
          parent zone for publication. This time is the publish time
          (Tpub) and the key is now said to be published.
</p>
<p>Event 3: after Dreg, the registration delay, the DS
          record is published in the parent zone. At this point, the
          zones have all the information needed for a validating
          resolver to authenticate the zone, although the information
          may not yet have reached all validating resolver
          caches. This time is the active time (Tact) and the key is
          said to be active.
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Tact = Tpub + Dreg
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>Event 4: at some point we need to give thought to key
          replacement. The successor key must be introduced into the
          zone (and its DS record submitted to the parent) at a time
          such that it becomes active when the current key has been
          active for its lifetime, Lksk.  This time is TpubS, the
          publication time of the successor key, and is given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>TpubS &lt;= Tact + Lksk - Dreg
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>... where Lksk is the lifetime of the KSK.
</p>
<p> Event 5: the successor key's DS record appears in the
          parent zone and the successor key becomes active. At this
          point, the current key becomes retired. This occurs at Tret,
          given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Tret = Tact + Lksk
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>Event 6: the current DNSKEY and DS record must be
          retained in the zones until any any validating resolver that
          has cached the DNSKEY and/or DS RRsets will have a copy of
          the data for the successor key. At this point the current
          key information is dead, as any validating resolver can
          perform authentication using the successor key. This is the
          dead time, Tdea, given by:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Tdea = Tret + Iret
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>... where Iret is the retire interval. This depends on
          how long both the successor DNSKEY and DS records take to
          propagate through the nameserver infrastructure and thence
          into validator caches. These delays are the publication
          intervals of the child and parent zones respectively, so a
          suitable expression for Iret is:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Iret = max(IpubP, IpubC)
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>IpubC is the publication interval of the DNSKEY in the
          child zone, IpubP that of the DS record in the parent.
</p>
<p>The child term comprises two parts - the time taken for
          the introduction of the DNSKEY record to be propagated to
          the downstream secondary servers (= DprpC, the child
          propagation delay) and the time taken for information about
          the DNSKEY RRset to expire from the validating resolver
          cache, i.e.
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>IpubC = DprpC + TTLkey
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>TTLkey is the TTL for a DNSKEY record in the child
          zone. The parent term is similar:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>IpubP = DprpP + TTLds
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>DprpP the propagation delay in the parent zone and TTLds
          the TTL for a DS record in the parent zone.
</p>
<p>Event 7: at some later time, the DNSKEY record can be
          removed from the child zone and a request can be made to
          remove the DS record from the parent zone. This is the
          removal time, Trem and is given by:
</p>
<p>

Interaction with Configured Trust Anchors</h3>

<p>Although the preceding sections have been concerned with
          rolling KSKs where the trust anchor is a DS record in the
          parent zone, zone managers may want to take account of the
          possibility that some validating resolvers may have
          configured trust anchors directly.
</p>
<p>Rolling a configured trust anchor is dealt with in <a class='info' href='#RFC5011'>[RFC5011]<span> (</span><span class='info'>StJohns, M., &ldquo;Automated Updates of DNS Security (DNSSEC) Trust Anchors,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. It requires introducing the KSK to be
          used as the trust anchor into the zone for a period of time
          before use, and retaining it (with the "revoke" bit set) for
          some time after use. The Double-Signature and Double-RRset
          methods can be adapted to include <a class='info' href='#RFC5011'>[RFC5011]<span> (</span><span class='info'>StJohns, M., &ldquo;Automated Updates of DNS Security (DNSSEC) Trust Anchors,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>
          recommendations so that the rollover will also be signalled
          to validating resolvers with configured trust anchors. (The
          recommendations are not suitable for the Double-DS
          method. Introducing the new key early and retaining the old
          key after use effectively converts it into a form of
          Double-RRset.)

Removal of KSK</h3>

<p>The timeline for the removal of the key in both methods
            is modified by introducing a new state, "revoked". When
            the key reaches the end of the retire period, instead of
            being declared "dead", it is revoked; the "revoke" bit is
            set on the DNSKEY RR and is published in (and used to
            sign) the DNSKEY RRset. The key is maintained in this
            state for the "revoke" interval, Irev, given by:

<a name="rfc.section.3.3.5"></a><h3>3.3.5.&nbsp;
Introduction of First KSK</h3>

<p>There is an additional consideration when introducing a
          KSK into a zone for the first time, and that is that no
          validating resolver should be in a position where it can
          access the trust anchor before the KSK appears in the
          zone. To do so will cause the validating resolver to declare
          the zone to be bogus. 
</p>
<p>This is important: in the case of a secure parent, it
          means ensuring that the DS record is not published in the
          parent zone until there is no possibility that a validating
          resolver can obtain the record yet not be able to obtain the
          corresponding DNSKEY. In the case of an insecure parent,
          i.e. the initial creation of a new security apex, it is
          important to not configure trust anchors in validating
          resolvers until the DNSKEY RRset has had sufficient time to
          propagate. In both cases, this time is the trust anchor
          availability time (Ttaa) given by: 
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Ttaa &gt;= Tpub + IpubC
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>IpubC = DprpC + TTLkeyC
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>IpubC = DprpC + IngcC
</p>
</blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>The first expression applies if there was previously a
          DNSKEY RRset in the child zone, the expression for IpubC
          including the TTLkeyC term to account for the time taken for
          that RRset to expire from caches. (It is possible that the
          zone was signed but that the trust anchor had not been
          submitted to the parent.)
</p>
<p>If the introduction of the KSK caused the appearance of
          the first DNSKEY RRset in the child zone, the second
          expression applies in which the TTLkeyC term is replaced by
          Ingc to allow for the effect of negative caching.
</p>
<p>As before, IngcC is the negative cache interval from the
          child zone's SOA record, calculated according to <a class='info' href='#RFC2308'>[RFC2308]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andrews, M., &ldquo;Negative Caching of DNS Queries (DNS NCACHE),&rdquo; March&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> as the minimum of the TTL of the SOA
          record itself (TTLsoaC), and the "minimum" field in the
          record's parameters (SOAminC), i.e.
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>IngcC = min(TTLsoaC, SOAminC)

Standby Keys</h3>

<p> Although keys will usually be rolled according to some
      regular schedule, there may be occasions when an emergency
      rollover is required, e.g. if the active key is suspected of
      being compromised. The aim of the emergency rollover is to allow
      the zone to be re- signed with a new key as soon as possible. As
      a key must be in the ready state to sign the zone, having at
      least one additional key (a standby key) in this state at all
      times will minimise delay. 
</p>
<p> In the case of a ZSK, a standby key only really makes sense
      with the Pre-Publication method. A permanent standby DNSKEY RR
      should be included in zone or successor keys could be introduced
      as soon as possible after a key becomes active. Either way
      results in an additional ZSK in the DNSKEY RRset that can
      immediately be used to sign the zone if the current key is
      compromised.
</p>
<p> (Although in theory the mechanism could be used with both
      the Double-Signature and Double-RRSIG methods, it would require
      Pre-Publication of the signatures. Essentially, the standby key
      would be permanently active, as it would have to be periodically
      used to renew signatures. Zones would also permanently require
      two sets of signatures, something that could have a performance
      impact in large zones.) 
</p>
<p> A standby key can also be used with the Double-Signature and
      Double-DS methods of rolling a KSK. (The idea of a standby key
      in the Double-RRset effectively means having two active keys.)
      The Double-Signature method requires that the standby KSK be
      included in the DNSKEY RRset; rolling the key then requires just
      the introduction of the DS record in the parent.  (Note that the
      DNSKEY should also be used to sign the DNSKEY RRset. As the
      RRset and its signatures travel together, merely adding the
      DNSKEY does not provide the desired time saving; to be used in a
      rollover requires that the DNSKEY RRset be signed with the
      standby key, and this introduces a delay whilst the RRset and
      its signatures propagate to the caches of validating
      resolvers. There is no time advantage over introducing a new
      DNSKEY and signing the RRset with it at the same time.) 
</p>
<p>In the Double-DS method of rolling a KSK, it is not a standby
      key that is present, it is a standby DS record in the parent
      zone. Whatever algorithm is used, the standby item of data can
      be introduced as a permanent standby, or be a successor
      introduced as early as possible.

<a name="rfc.section.5"></a><h3>5.&nbsp;
Algorithm Considerations</h3>

<p>The preceding sections have implicitly assumed that all keys
      and signatures are created using a single algorithm. However,
      <a class='info' href='#RFC4035'>[RFC4035]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arends, R., Austein, R., Larson, M., Massey, D., and S. Rose, &ldquo;Protocol Modifications for the DNS Security Extensions,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> (section 2.4) states that "There MUST
      be an RRSIG for each RRset using at least one DNSKEY of each
      algorithm in the zone apex DNSKEY RRset".
</p>
<p>Except in the case of an algorithm rollover - where the
      algorithms used to create the signatures are being changed -
      there is no relationship between the keys of different
      algorithms. This means that they can be rolled independently of
      one another. In other words, the key rollover logic described
      above should be run separately for each algorithm; the union of
      the results is included in the zone, which is signed using the
      active key for each algorithm.

Limitation of Scope</h3>

<p>This document represents current thinking at the time of
      publication. However, the subject matter is evolving and it is
      more than likely that this document will need to be revised in
      the future.
</p>
<p>Some of the techniques and ideas that DNSSEC operators are
      thinking about differ from this those described in this
      document. Of note are alternatives to the strict split into KSK
      and ZSK key roles and the consequences for rollover logic from
      partial signing (i.e. when the new key initially only signs a
      fraction of the zone while leaving other signatures generated by
      the old key in place).
</p>
<p>Furthermore, as noted in section 5, this document covers only
      rolling keys of the same algorithm, it does not cover transition
      to/from/addition/deletion of different algorithm. Algorithm
      rollovers will require a separate document.
</p>
<p>The reader is therefore reminded that DNSSEC is as of
      publication in early stages of deployment, and best practices
      will likely change in the near term.

Summary</h3>

<p> For ZSKs, "Pre-Publication" is generally considered to be
      the preferred way of rolling keys. As shown in this document,
      the time taken to roll is wholly dependent on parameters under
      the control of the zone manager.
</p>
<p> In contrast, "Double-RRset" is the most efficient method for
      KSK rollover due to the ability to have new DS records and
      DNSKEY RRsets propagate in parallel. The time taken to roll KSKs
      may depend on factors related to the parent zone if the parent
      is signed. For zones that intend to comply with the
      recommendations of <a class='info' href='#RFC5011'>[RFC5011]<span> (</span><span class='info'>StJohns, M., &ldquo;Automated Updates of DNS Security (DNSSEC) Trust Anchors,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, in virtually all
      cases the rollover time will be determined by the RFC5011 "add
      hold-down" and "remove hold-down" times. It should be emphasized
      that this delay is a policy choice and not a function of timing
      values and that it also requires changes to the rollover process
      due to the need to manage revocation of trust anchors.
</p>
<p>Finally, the treatment of emergency key rollover is
      significantly simplified by the introduction of stand-by keys as
      standard practice during all types of rollovers.

List of Symbols</h3>

<p> The document defines a number of symbols, all of which are listed here. All are of the
        form:
</p>
<p>All symbols used in the text are of the form:
</p>
<p>
        </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>&lt;TYPE&gt;&lt;id&gt;&lt;INST&gt;
</p>
</blockquote><p>
      
</p>
<p> where:
</p>
<p>&lt;TYPE&gt; is an upper-case character indicating what type the symbol is. Defined
        types are:
</p>
<p>
        </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>D</dt>
<dd>delay: interval that is a feature of the process
</dd>
<dt>I</dt>
<dd>interval between two events
</dd>
<dt>L</dt>
<dd>lifetime: interval set by the zone manager
</dd>
<dt>SOA</dt>
<dd>parameter related to SOA RR
</dd>
<dt>T</dt>
<dd>a point in time
</dd>
<dt>TTL</dt>
<dd>TTL of a record
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>
      
</p>
<p>T and I are self-explanatory. D, and L are also time periods, but whereas I values are
        intervals between two events (even if the events are defined in terms of the interval, e.g.
        the dead time occurs "retire interval" after the retire time), D, and L are fixed intervals.
        An "L" interval (lifetime) is chosen by the zone manager and is a feature of policy. A "D"
        interval (delay) is a feature of the process, probably outside control of the zone manager.
        SOA and TTL are used just because they are common terms.
</p>
<p>&lt;id&gt; is lower-case and defines what object or event the variable is related
        to, e.g.
</p>
<p>
        </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>act</dt>
<dd>active
</dd>
<dt>ngc</dt>
<dd>negative cache
</dd>
<dt>pub</dt>
<dd>publication
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>
      
</p>
<p>Finally, &lt;INST&gt; is a capital letter that distinguishes between the same
        variable applying to different instances of an object and is one of:
</p>
<p>
        </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>C</dt>

</dd>
<dt>G</dt>

            organisation to that managing the child zone, the delays associated with passing data
            between zones is captured by this term.
</dd>
<dt>Dskw</dt>
<dd>Clock skew. The maximum difference in time between the signing system
            and the resolver.
</dd>
<dt>Dsgn</dt>
<dd>Signing delay. After the introduction of a new ZSK, the amount of time
            taken for all the RRs in the zone to be signed with it.
</dd>
<dt>Ingc</dt>
<dd>Negative cache interval.
</dd>
<dt>IngcP</dt>
<dd>Negative cache interval of the child zone.
</dd>
<dt>IngcP</dt>
<dd>Negative cache interval of the parent zone.
</dd>
<dt>Ipub</dt>
<dd>Publication interval. The amount of time that must elapse after the
            publication of a key before it can be considered to have entered the ready state.
</dd>
<dt>IpubC</dt>
<dd>Publication interval in the child zone.
</dd>
<dt>IpubG</dt>
<dd>Publication interval for the signature.
</dd>
<dt>IpubK</dt>
<dd>Publication interval for the key.
</dd>
<dt>IpubP</dt>
<dd>Publication interval in the parent zone.
</dd>
<dt>Iret</dt>
<dd>Retire interval. The amount of time that must elapse after a key enters
            the retire state for any signatures created with it to be purged from validating
            resolver caches.
</dd>
<dt>Irev</dt>
<dd>Revoke interval. The amount of time that a KSK must remain published
            with the revoke bit set to satisfy <a class='info' href='#RFC5011'>[RFC5011]<span> (</span><span class='info'>StJohns, M., &ldquo;Automated Updates of DNS Security (DNSSEC) Trust Anchors,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> considerations.
</dd>
<dt>Lksk</dt>
<dd>Lifetime of a key-signing key. This is the intended amount of time for
            which this particular KSK is regarded as the active KSK. Depending on when the key is
            rolled-over, the actual lifetime may be longer or shorter than this.
</dd>
<dt>Lzsk</dt>
<dd>Lifetime of a zone-signing key. This is the intended amount of time for
            which the ZSK is used to sign the zone. Depending on when the key is rolled-over, the
            actual lifetime may be longer or shorter than this.
</dd>
<dt>Lsig</dt>
<dd>Lifetime of a signature: the difference in time between the signature's
            expiration time and the time at which the signature was created. (Note that this is not
            the difference between the signature's expiration and inception times: the latter is
            usually set a small amount of time before the signature is created to allow for clock
            skew between the signing system and the validating resolver.)
</dd>
<dt>SOAmin</dt>
<dd>Value of the "minimum" field from an SOA record.
</dd>
<dt>SOAminC</dt>
<dd>Value of the "minimum" field from an SOA record in the child zone.
</dd>
<dt>SOAminP</dt>
<dd>Value of the "minimum" field from an SOA record in the parent zone.
</dd>
<dt>Tact</dt>
<dd>Active time of the key; the time at which the key is regarded as the
            principal key for the zone.
</dd>
<dt>TactS</dt>
<dd>Active time of the successor key.
</dd>
<dt>Tdea</dt>
<dd>Dead time of a key. Applicable only to ZSKs, this is the time at which
            any record signatures held in validating resolver caches are guaranteed to be created
            with the successor key.
</dd>
<dt>Tgen</dt>
<dd>Generate time of a key. The time that a key is created.
</dd>
<dt>Tpub</dt>
<dd>Publish time of a key. The time that a key appears in a zone for the
            first time.
</dd>
<dt>TpubS</dt>
<dd>Publish time of the successor key.
</dd>
<dt>Trem</dt>
<dd>Removal time of a key. The time at which a key is removed from the
            zone.
</dd>
<dt>Tret</dt>
<dd>Retire time of a key. The time at which a successor key starts being
            used to sign the zone.
</dd>
<dt>Trdy</dt>
<dd>Ready time of a key. The time at which it can be guaranteed that
            validating resolvers that have key information from this zone cached have a copy of this
            key in their cache. (In the case of KSKs, should the validating resolvers also have DS
            information from the parent zone cached, the cache must include information about the DS
            record corresponding to the key.) 
</dd>
<dt>TrdyS</dt>
<dd>Ready time of a successor key.
</dd>
<dt>Tsub</dt>
<dd>Submit time - the time at which the DS record of a KSK is submitted to
            the parent.
</dd>
<dt>TsubS</dt>
<dd>Submit time of the successor key.
</dd>
<dt>TTLds</dt>
<dd>Time to live of a DS record (in the parent zone).
</dd>
<dt>TTLkey</dt>
<dd>Time to live of a DNSKEY record.
</dd>
<dt>TTLkeyC</dt>
<dd>Time to live of a DNSKEY record in the child zone.
</dd>
<dt>TTLsoa</dt>
<dd>Time to live of a SOA record.
</dd>
<dt>TTLsoaC</dt>
<dd>Time to live of a SOA record in the child zone.
</dd>
<dt>TTLsoaP</dt>
<dd>Time to live of a SOA record in the parent zone.
</dd>
<dt>TTLsig</dt>
<dd>Time to live of an RRSIG record.
</dd>
<dt>Ttaa</dt>
<dd>Trust anchor availability time. The time at which a trust anchor record
            can be made available when a KSK is first introduced into a zone.
</dd>
