Internet-Draft       L1vpn dynamic PIT configuration          April 2010


1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this document is to define a dynamic PIT configuration
   mechanism for L1VPNs allowing the customer to configure PIT
   dynamically.  The PIT contains a list of <CPI, PPI> tuples for all
   the ports within its L1VPN as outlined in [RFC5251], and controls the
   access of each new customer.  However, the PIT cannot be configured
   via CE-PE signaling directly on account of security [RFC5251].  To
   provide the new customer with more flexibility, this document
   proposes a mechanism enabling new customers to configure PIT
   dynamically via Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
   Signaling Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
   Extensions (GMPLS RSVP-TE) Signaling [RFC3473].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST ", "MUST NOT ", "REQUIRED ", "SHALL ", "SHALL NOT
   ", "SHOULD ", "SHOULD NOT ", "RECOMMENDED ", "MAY ", and "OPTIONAL "
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Premise

   This document divides the procedure of VPN construction into two
   phases:

   1.  VPN information configuration.  It includes assignment of VPN-ID,
       PIT configuration, etc, which are configured before establishing
       actual LSP between VPN members.
   2.  Establishing actual LSP.  Each VPN member port can establish
       actual LSP to another VPN ports arbitrarily after Phase 1.

   All the content of this document belongs to the first phase.


4.  PIT configuring architecture

   To make PIT configuration dynamically by a new customer, a customer-
   access-control architecture and an additional control channel between
   CE and PE named Public Control Channel (PCC) are REQUIRED in this
   document.  The public control channel is a special channel dedicated
   to transporting PIT configuration relevant message.  The customer-
   access-control architecture aims to enable existing L1VPN members to
   control the access of each new customer.

4.1.  Public Control Channel

   In the context of L1VPN, a CE is connected to a PE via one or more
   ports consisting of one or more channels or sub-channels.  The PCC
   MAY be supplied by these sub-channels or by any IP channel which is
   supported by dedicated line or lay2 VPN, lay3 VPN etc.

   Once a Customer Edge (CE) is connected to service provider network, a
   PCC SHOULD be bound and configured by service provider.

   To initiate a new VPN or join in an existing VPN, the new customers
   SHOULD submit the corresponding requests to its adjacent PE via this
   PCC.

   We refer to the CE's address of the PCC as CE Public Control Channel
   Address (Public-CE-CC-Addr), and the PE's address as the PE Public
   Control Channel Address (Public-CE-CC-Addr) as shown in figure.1.
   Public-CE-CC-Addr and Public-CE-CC-Addr are both REQUIRED to be
   unique to the involved CE-PE pair.

   And the CPI, PPI and VPN-PPI are Customer Port Identifier, Provider
   Port Identifier and VPN Provider Port Identifier respectively which
   are defined in [RFC5251].  The assignment of the PPIs is controlled
   solely by the service provider, while assignment of addresses used by
   the CPIs and VPN-PPIs is controlled solely by the administrators of
   L1VPN.  The CPI, PPI, and VPN-PPI WILL be consulted between CE and PE
   sequentially for PIT configuration.

4.2.  User network interface address bounding

   When network needs PIT configuration, the user network interface
   addresses WILL be consulted between CE and PE sequentially.  The VPN
   control channel (CE-CC-Addr and PE-CC-Addr) WILL be determined
   through public control channel, And the data plane channel (CPI,PPI
   and VPN-PPI) WILL be bound through its VPN control channel.  Once
   these addresses are fixed, the PIT configuration is finished.

4.3.  Customer-Access-Control Architecture

   This architecture is to release the service provider from traditional
   complicated VPN access control for each new customer and SHOULD be
   deployed in customer network without service provider involved.

   Each PE not only maintains PIT information for all L1VPN associated
   with it, but also maintains the access control information for all
   L1VPN.  The access information SHOULD contain four items at least as
   follows:

   1.  VPN-ID.  It is a virtual VPN identifier assigned by service
       provider when a customer initiates a VPN.  It is to allow any new
       customer to join in it so long as this customer gets the
       permission of the customer-access-control.  And the VPN-ID is
       REQUIRED to be unique in service provider network.
   2.  Access-tactic.  It is an item to identify the tactic of the
       customer-access-control for certain VPN.  The service provider
       network needs not recognize it.
   3.  Access point.  It is to indicate the access point address of
       customer-access-control.
   4.  PPI of source PE.  By means of it, other PEs can locate the
       source PE for certain VPN-ID conveniently.  (We refer to the VPN
       initiator CE as source CE, and its adjacent PE as source PE.)

   We refer to the table storing the above information on each PE as
   VPN-Access-Table.


5.  PIT configuration scenarios

   There are four scenarios needing PIT configuration:

   1.  Initiate a VPN;
   2.  Join in an existing VPN;
   3.  Quit from certain VPN;
   4.  Delete a VPN;

   All these scenarios are on the assumption that all the customers have

   got the permission from management control system of service provider
   network.

5.1.  Initiate a VPN

   To initiate a VPN, a customer SHOULD deploy a customer-access-control
   for its own VPN firstly, and then send an initiate-VPN-request to its
   adjacent PE from PCC.  The content of the request SHOULD contain the
   bandwidth, tactic of customer-access-control, and access point as
   shown in Figure 2.



             +------------------------------------------------+
             |              bandwidth  (1 octets)             |

             |           reserved (4 octets)                  |
             +------------------------------------------------+

                   Figure 2.The initiate-VPN information

   When the service provider receives this request, it WILL check
   whether there is enough data plane resource to support the bandwidth
   requirement.  If there is enough resource, the service provider WILL
   assign a VPN-ID for this customer, and send a VPN-ID-announcement to
   the customer from PCC as illustrated in Figure 3.  Meanwhile, the PIT
   configuration SHOULD be finished for this customer.  Besides, a VPN-
   access-configuration message WILL be advertised to all PEs through
   multi-protocol Extensions to BGP [RFC4760].

             +------------------------------------------------+

               Figure 3.The VPN-ID announcement information

   [RFC4760] defines the format of two BGP attributes, MP_REACH_NLRI and
   MP_UNREACH_NLRI, which can be used to announce and withdraw the
   announcement of reachability information.  We introduce a new
   subsequent address family identifier, named PIT-Dynamic-

   configuration-Information (to be assigned by the IANA), and also
   multiple Network-Layer-Reachability-Informations (NLRIs) formats for
   carrying the PIT relevant message which are distinguished by sub-
   type.

   And a sub-NLRI format is defined for VPN-access-configuration message
   as shown in Figure 4.  And its sub-type SHOULD be set to 1.  The
   VPN-ID, access-tactic, access point, PPI of source PE SHOULD be
   carried in it.

   Note that if the value of the Length of the Next Hop field (of the
   MP_REACH_NLRI attribute) is 4, then the Next Hop contains an IPv4
   address.  If this value is 16, then the Next Hop contains an IPv6
   address.

   Each PE maintains a VPN-Access-Table to keep access-control
   information for all L1VPN.

5.2.  Join in an existing VPN

   To join in an existing VPN, the new customer (called join-customer)
   SHOULD send a join-in-request to its adjacent PE (called join-PE)
   from PCC.  The content of the request at least SHOULD contain the
   VPN-ID associated with the existing VPN as shown in Figure 5.

   tactic of the customer-access-control associated with this VPN, and
   then response to the customer as tactic-announcement shown in Figure
   6.

   The customer WILL re-encapsulate a re-access-control-request
   according to the special format corresponding to the access-control
   tactic, and re-sends to its adjacent PE.  The format of this request
   is shown in Figure 7.

   The apply-reply status SHOULD set to 1 as an access control request,
   and set to 0 as an access control reply.  The access status is valid
   only when this message is an access control reply.

   Note that the identity authentication info WILL be transparently
   passed by service provider network, and be used by customer-access-
   control.  Therefore, its content is changed according to the tactic
   of the customer-access-control.

            Figure 7.The re-access-control-request information

   When the ingress node (join-PE) receives the re-access-control-
   request, it WILL map the re-access-control-request information into a
   new sub-NLRI of PIT-Dynamic-configuration-Informationn, called
   access-request as shown in Figure 8, and its sub-type SHOULD be set
   to 2.  And then send the access-request to the egress node (source
   PE) through multi-protocol Extensions to BGP [RFC4760].

   When the egress node (source PE) receives this access-request, it
   WILL search local VPN-Access-Table to find out the access point of
   the customer-access-control associated with this VPN.  And the re-
   access-control request information of the access-request WILL be
   extracted and mapped into remote-access-request whose format is
   identical to the re-access-control request shown in figure 7. and
   then the remote-access-request WILL be sent to the access point from
   VPN control channel.

   When the customer-access-control finishes the identity authentication
   for the new customer, it WILL initiate an access-control-reply
   message as shown in figure 9, and reply to the source PE.

   The apply-reply status SHOULD be set to 0 as an access-control-reply.
   And if the customer-access-control approves this new customer, the
   access status value SHOULD be set to 1; otherwise, set to 0;

   When the egress node (source PE) receives this message, it WILL re-
   map the access-control-reply information into another new sub-NLRI of
   PIT-Dynamic-configuration-Information, called access-reply as shown
   in Figure 10, and its sub-type SHOULD be set to 3.  And the access-

   When the join-PE receives this reply, it checks the access status
   item.  If it is a positive reply, the PE WILL configure PIT for this
   customer, and send a VPN-port-member-announcement to this customer so
   that a port topology can be available to it.  Then the customer can
   create/delete physical link towards certain VPN member within the
   view of the VPN port topology dynamically.  The format of this
   announcement is shown in Figure 11.  Meanwhile, the PIT information
   WILL be advertised to the associated PEs through auto-discovery
   mechanism [RFC5195].

5.3.  Quit from certain VPN

   To quit from certain VPN, the customer SHOULD send a quit-from-VPN-
   request to its adjacent PE from VPN control channel as shown in
   Figure 12.

              Figure 12.The quit-from-VPN request information

   The service provider WILL check whether there are VPN physical links
   associated with this customer still.  If the physical link exists, it
   SHOULD be removed compulsively firstly (it is out of scope of this
   document).  Then the corresponding PIT configuration WILL be deleted
   and a quit-from-VPN-reply WILL be send to the customer from public
   control channel.  Meanwhile, the auto-discovery mechanism [RFC5195]
   WILL be triggered.  The format of quit-from-VPN-reply is shown in
   figure 13.  If the reply is an ack, the status item SHOULD be set to
   1; otherwise, set to 0.

5.4.  Delete a VPN

   To delete a VPN that initiated by himself, the customer SHOULD send a
   delete-VPN request to its adjacent PE from VPN control channel, the
   parameter of the request is same to the quit-from-VPN request.  When
   the PE receives this request, it WILL check whether there are VPN
   members or physical links associated with this very VPN still.  If
   the physical link exists, it SHOULD be removed compulsively and the
   members WILL be forced to quit from this VPN firstly.  Then the
   corresponding PIT configuration WILL be deleted and a delete-VPN-
   reply WILL be send to the customer from public control channel.
   Meanwhile, auto-discovery mechanism [RFC5195] WILL be triggered.  The

   format of delete-VPN-reply is identical to the quit-from-VPN-reply as
   shown in figure13.


6.  User Network Interface (UNI) signaling

   For the transmission of the PIT relevant message between CE and PE,
   we introduce a new object class (to be assigned by the IANA) to GMPLS
   RSVP-TE extensions [RFC3473], namely PIT-Dynamic-Configuration
   objcet.  It MAY be carried in Path message or Resv message.  This new
   object contains multiple C-Types (to be assigned by the IANA).  And
   each message described in the above sections WILL be mapped into
   unique C-Types of the PIT-Dynamic-Configuration object.  These
   massages include initiate-VPN-request, VPN-ID-announcement, join-in-
   request, tactic-announcement, re-access-control-request, remote-
   access-request, access-control-reply, VPN-port-member-announcement,
   quit-from-VPN request, quit-from-VPN-reply and delete-VPN-reply.

   All signaling procedures are identical to the GMPLS extensions
   specified in [RFC3473], except as noted in this document.  And the
   signaling procedure about the new object is as described in the above
   sections.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires assignment of a new SAFI, called PIT-Dynamic-
   configuration-Information (see Section 4).  This assignment has to be
   done from the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) registry
   using the Standards Action allocation procedures.  And the Class-num
   and C-Type of PIT-Dynamic-Configuration object (see Section 5)
   require to be assigned.


8.  Security Considerations

   Since the PIT can be configured by the customer via signaling between
   CE and PE, the L1VPN members SHOULD responsible for access control
   for each new customer.  Thus, much security consideration is
   transfered to the mechanism of the customer-access-control.
