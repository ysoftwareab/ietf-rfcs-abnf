         An HTTPS-based Transport for Configured Subscriptions
                   draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif-01

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data module for configuring HTTPS based
   configured subscription, as defined in Subscribed Notifications
   (RFC8639).  The use of HTTPS maximizes transport-level
   interoperability, while allowing for encoding selection from text,
   e.g.  XML or JSON, to binary.

1.  Introduction

   Subscribed Notifications [RFC8639] defines a YANG data module for
   configuring subscribed notifications.  It even defines a
   subscriptions container that contains a list of receivers.  But it
   defers the configuration and management of those receivers to other
   documents.  This document defines a YANG [RFC7950] data module for
   configuring and managing HTTPS based receivers for the notifications.
   Such a configured receiver can be a third party collector, collecting
   events on behalf of receivers that want to correlate events from
   different publishers.  Configured subscriptions enable a server,
   acting as a publisher of notifications, to proactively push
   notifications to external receivers without the receivers needing to
   first connect to the server, as is the case with dynamic
   subscriptions.

   This document describes how to enable the transmission of YANG
   modeled notifications, in the configured encoding (i.e., XML, JSON)
   over HTTPS.  It comes in the form of a HTTPS POST.  The use of HTTPS
   maximizes transport-level interoperability, while the encoding
   selection pivots between implementation simplicity (XML, JSON) and
   throughput (text versus binary).

2.  YANG module

2.1.  Overview

   The YANG module is a definition of a set of receivers that are
   interested in the notifications published by the publisher.  The
   module contains the TCP, TLS and HTTPS parameters that are needed to
   communicate with the receiver.  The module augments the Subscribed
   Notifications [RFC8639] receiver container to create a reference to a
   receiver defined by the YANG module.  As mentioned earlier, it uses
   POST method to deliver the notification.  The attribute 'path'
   defines the absolute path for the resource on the receiver, as
   defined by 'path-absolute' in URI Generic Syntax [RFC3986].  The
   user-id used by Network Configuration Access Control Model [RFC8341],
   is that of the receiver and is derived from the certificate presented
   by the receiver.

   An abridged tree diagram representing the module is shown below.

3.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].  The NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers one URI and one YANG module.

4.1.  URI Registration

   in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688] [RFC3688].  Following the format
   in RFC 3688, the following registration is requested to be made:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-http-notif

   Registrant Contact: The IESG.  XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML
   namespace.

4.2.  YANG Module Name Registration

   This document registers one YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry YANG [RFC6020].

   name: ietf-https-notif
   namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-https-notif
   prefix: hn
   reference: RFC XXXX

5.  Examples

   This section tries to show some examples in how the model can be
   used.

5.1.  HTTPS Configured Subscription

   This example shows how a HTTPS client can be configured to send
   notifications to a receiver at address 192.0.2.1, port 443, a 'path',
   with server certificates, and the corresponding trust store that is
   used to authenticate a connection.
