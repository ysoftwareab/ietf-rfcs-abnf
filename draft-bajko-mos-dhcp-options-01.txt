1. Introduction 
    
   IEEE 802.21 [1] defines three distinct service types to facilitate 
   link layer handovers across heterogeneous technologies: 
    
   a) Information Services (IS) 
        IS provides a unified framework to the higher layer entities 
   across the heterogeneous network environment to facilitate discovery 
   and selection of multiple types of networks existing within a 
   geographical area, with the objective to help the higher layer 
   mobility protocols to acquire a global view of the heterogeneous 
   networks and perform seamless handover across these networks. 
    
   b) Event Services (ES) 
        Events may indicate changes in state and transmission behavior 
   of the physical, data link and logical link layers, or predict state

   changes of these layers. The Event Service may also be used to 
   indicate management actions or command status on the part of the 
   network or some management entity. 
    
   c) Command Services (CS) 
        The command service enables higher layers to control the 
   physical, data link, and logical link layers. The higher layers may 
   control the reconfiguration or selection of an appropriate link 
   through a set of handover commands. 
    
   In IEEE terminology these services are called Media Independent 
   Handover (MIH) services. 
   While these services may be co-located, the different pattern and 
   type of information they provide does not necessitate the co-
   location. 
    
   An MN may make use of any of these MIH service types separately or 
   any combination of them.  
    
   It is anticipated that a Mobility Server will not necessarily host 
   all three of these MIH services together, thus there is a need to 
   discover the MIH services types separately. 
    
   This document defines three dhcp options for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6, one 
   for each of the services defined in [1], namely IS, ES and CS. The 
   options would allow an MN to locate a Mobility Server which hosts 
   the desired MIH service type (IS, ES or CS) the MN is looking for. 
   This is one of the possible solutions for locating a server 
   providing Mobility Services; manual configuration is an example of 
   another. 
    
2. DHCPv4 Options for MoS Discovery 
    
   This section describes three options for DHCPv4. 
    
   The DHCPv4 options for MoS discovery carry either a 32-bit (binary) 
   IPv4 address or, preferably, a DNS [RFC1035] fully-qualified domain 
   name to be used by the MN to locate a server hosting either an IS, 
   an ES or a CS service.

       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   Option code: IPv4 MoS option codes assigned by IANA (tbd), separate 
   ones for IS (IPv4-IS), for ES (IPv4-ES) and CS (IPv4-CS).

   the 'Length' field, including the encoding byte

Mobility Services DHCP Options                             August 2007 
    
   enc: one byte indicating the encoding type of the next field  
    
   The options have two encodings, specified by the encoding byte 
   ('enc') that follows the code byte. If the encoding byte has the 
   value 0, it is followed by a list of domain names, as described 
   below (Section 2.1). If the encoding byte has the value 1, it is 
   followed by one or more IPv4 addresses (Section 2.2). All 
   implementations MUST support both encodings. The 'Length' field 
   indicates the total number of octets in the option following the 
   'Length' field, including the encoding byte. 
    
   A DHCP server MUST NOT mix the two encodings in the same DHCP 
   message, even if it sends two different instances of the same 
   option. Attempts to do so would result in incorrect client behavior 
   as DHCP processing rules call for the concatenation of multiple 
   instances of an option into a single option prior to processing the 
   option [7]. 
    
   The code for the MIH IS option is XXX. The code for the MIH ES 
   option is YYY. The code for the MIH CS option is ZZZ. 
    
2.1 Domain Name List 
    
   If the 'enc' byte has a value of 0, the encoding byte is followed by 
   a sequence of labels, encoded according to Section 3.1 of [RFC1035], 
   quoted below: 
    
        Domain names in messages are expressed in terms of a sequence 
        of labels. Each label is represented as a one octet length 
        field followed by that number of octets.  Since every domain 
        name ends with the null label of the root, a domain name is 
        terminated by a length byte of zero. The high order two bits of 
        every length octet must be zero, and the remaining six bits of 
        the length field limit the label to 63 octets or less. To 
        simplify implementations, the total length of a domain name 
        (i.e., label octets and label length octets) is restricted to 
        255 octets or less. 
    
   [RFC1035] encoding was chosen to accommodate future 
   internationalized domain name mechanisms. 
   The minimum length for this encoding is 3. 
    
   The option MAY contain multiple domain names, but these SHOULD refer 
   to different NAPTR records, rather than different A records. The 
   client MUST try the records in the order listed, applying the 
   mechanism described in [8] for each. The client only resolves the 
   subsequent domain names if attempts to contact the first one failed 
   or yielded no common transport protocols between the MN and the 
   server.

   Use of multiple domain names is not meant to replace NAPTR and SRV 
   records, but rather to allow a single DHCP server to indicate MIH 
   servers operated by multiple providers. 
    
   Clients MUST support compression according to the encoding in 
   Section 4.1.4 of "Domain Names - Implementation And Specification" 
   [RFC1035]. 
    
        Since the domain names are supposed to be different domains, 
        compression will likely have little effect, however. 
    
   If the length of the domain list exceeds the maximum permissible 
   within a single option (254 octets), then the domain list MUST be 
   represented in the DHCP message as specified in [7]. 
    
   The DHCP option for this encoding has the following format: 
    
           Code  Len   enc   DNS name of MoS server 
         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-- 
         | XXX |  n  |  0  |  s1 |  s2 |  s3 |  s4 | s5  |  ... 
         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-- 
    
   As an example, consider the case where the server wants to offer two 
   MIH IS servers, "example.com" and "example.net".  These would be 
   encoded as follows: 
    
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
   |XXX|27 | 0 | 7 |'e'|'x'|'a'|'m'|'p'|'l'|'e'| 3 |'c'|'o'|'m'| 0 | 
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
   | 7 |'e'|'x'|'a'|'m'|'p'|'l'|'e'| 3 |'n'|'e'|'t'| 0 | 
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
    
2.2 IPv4 Address List 
    
   If the 'enc' byte has a value of 1, the encoding byte is followed by 
   a list of IPv4 addresses indicating appropriate MIH servers 
   available to the MN. Servers MUST be listed in order of preference. 
    
   Its minimum length is 5, and the length MUST be a multiple of 4 plus 
   one. The DHCP option for this encoding has the following format: 
    
          Code   Len   enc  IPv4 Address 1          IPv4 Address 2 
         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-- 
         | XXX |  n  |  1  | a1  | a2  | a3  | a4  | a1  |  ...

            MoS Information 
    
               An MoS IP address or MoS FQDN to be provided to a mobile  
               node according to the sub-opt-code. 
    
    
   The sub-opt-code, sub-opt-len and MoS Information fields are set in 
   the same manner as those of an IPv6 Relay Agent sub-option. 
    
4. Option Usage 
    
4.1 Usage of DHCPv4 Options for MoS Discovery 
    
   The requesting and sending of the proposed DHCPv4 options follow the 
   rules for DHCP options in [RFC2131]. 
    
4.1.1 Mobile Node behavior 
    
   The mobile node may perform the MoS information discovery procedure 
   either during initial association with a network or when the 
   mobility service is required. It may also try to perform the MoS 
   information discovery when it lacks the network information for MoS 
   or needs to change the  MoS for some reasons, for instance, to 
   recover from the single point of failure of the existing MoS  
    
   In order to acquire the MoS information, the mobile node MUST send a 
   REQUEST message to a unicast server address. In this message the 
   mobile node (DHCP client) MUST include the Option Code for the MoS 
   Discovery option in the OPTION_code. 
    
4.1.2 DHCP Server behavior

Mobility Services DHCP Options                             August 2007 
    
   When the DHCP server receives the REQUEST message with the MoS 
   Discovery option in the OPTION_code, the DHCP server MUST follow the 
   [RFC2131] logic to construct a REPLY message with the MoS Discovery 
   option. The reply message may contain IP address or the FQDN of the 
   MoS Server. 
    
   In case that the server cannot find any MoS information, it MUST 
   return the MoS Discovery option by setting the MoS Server address 
   0.0.0.0 with 'enc' 1.  
    
4.2 DHCPv6 Options for MoS discovery 
    
   TBD. 
    
4.2.1 Mobile node behavior 
    
4.2.2 DHCP Relay Agent behavior 
    
4.2.3 DHCP Server behavior 
    
    
5. Security Considerations 
    
   The security considerations in [RFC2131] apply. If an adversary 
   manages to modify the response from a DHCP server or insert its own 
   response, an MN could be led to contact a rogue Mobility Server, 
   possibly one that then would provide wrong information, event or 
   command for handover.  
    
   It is recommended to use either DHCP authentication option described 
   in [RFC3118] where available, or rely upon link layer security. This 
   will also protect the denial of service attacks to DHCP servers. 
   [RFC3118] provides mechanisms for both entity authentication and 
   message authentication. 
    
6. IANA Considerations 
    
   This document registers the following dhcpv4 options with IANA: 
    
   IPv4-IS 
   IPv4-ES 
   IPv4-CS 
    
   This document also registers the following dhcpv6 options with IANA: 
    
   IPv6-MoSINF 
   IPv6-MoS 
    
   This document also registers the following dhcpv6 Relay options with 
   IANA: 
    
   IPv6-MoS-RELAY
