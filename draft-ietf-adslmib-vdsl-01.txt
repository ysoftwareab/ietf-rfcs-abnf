1.  Abstract

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base 
   (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the 
   Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects used for 
   managing Very high speed Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL) interfaces
   [18, 19, 20].

   This document specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant 
   to the SMIv2 (STD 58 [5, 6, 7]).

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
       STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
       The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC
       2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].

   o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of the SNMP
       message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track

INTERNET-DRAFT                 VDSL-LINE MIB                  March 2002

       protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
       RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is
       called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and
       RFC 2574 [12].

   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol
       operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
       [13].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14]
       and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC
       2575 [15].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [17].

3.  Introduction

   This document describes an SNMP MIB for managing VDSL Lines.  These
   definitions are based upon the specifications for VDSL as defined 
   in [18, 19, 20].

   The MIB is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission, as 
   discussed in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 2863 [23]) section of this 
   document.  

3.1 IANA Considerations 

   The SNMPv2-TM MIB module requires the allocation of a single object 
   identifier for its MODULE-IDENTITY.  IANA should allocate this object 
   identifier in the snmpModules subtree, defined in the SNMPv2-SMI MIB 
   module.

3.2.  Relationship of the VDSL Line MIB to other MIBs

   This section outlines the relationship of this MIB with other MIBs 
   described in RFCs.  Specifically, IF-MIB as presented RFC 2863 [23]
   is discussed.

3.2.1  General IF-MIB Integration (RFC 2863)

   The VDSL Line MIB specifies the detailed attributes of a data
   interface.  As such, it needs to integrate with RFC 2863 [23]. The
   IANA has assigned the following ifType to VDSL:

   IANAifType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       ...
   SYNTAX INTEGER {
       ...
       vdsl(97), -- Very H-speed Digital Subscrib. Loop
       ...
       }

3.2.2  Usage of ifTable

   The MIB branch identified by this ifType contains tables appropriate
   for this interface type.  Most such tables extend the ifEntry table,
   and are indexed by ifIndex.  For interfaces in systems implementing
   this MIB, those table entries indexed by ifIndex MUST be persistent.

   The following attributes are part of the mandatory ifGeneral group in
   RFC 2863 [23], and are not duplicated in the VDSL Line MIB.

   ===================================================================
       ifIndex                  Interface index.

       ifDescr                  See interfaces MIB [21].

       ifType                   vdsl(97) 

       ifSpeed                  Set as appropriate.
    
       ifPhysAddress            This object MUST have an octet string
                                with zero length.

       ifAdminStatus            See interfaces MIB [21].

       ifOperStatus             See interfaces MIB [21].

       ifLastChange             See interfaces MIB [21].

       ifName                   See interfaces MIB [21].

       ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable   Default to enabled(1).

   unit) and a Vtur (the remote termination unit).

             +-------+                  +-------+   

          Figure 2: General topology for a VDSL Line

4.4.  Counters, Interval Buckets and Thresholds

   For Loss of Frame (lof), Loss of Link (lol), Loss of Signal (los),
   and Loss of Power (lpr), there are event counters, current 15-minute 
   and 0 to 96 15-minute history bucket(s) of "interval-counters".  
   Each current 15-minute event bucket has an associated threshold 
   notification.

   Each of these counters uses the textual conventions defined in the
   HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB.  The HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB is a work-in-progress,
   but simply defines 64-bit versions of the textual conventions
   found in RFC 2493 [21].

   Unlike RFC 2493 [21] and RFC 2662 [22], there is no representation
   in the MIB for invalid buckets.  In those cases where the data for
   an interval is suspect or known to be invalid, the agent MUST NOT
   report the interval.  If the current 15-minute event bucket is 
   determined to be invalid, notifications based upon the value of the
   event bucket MUST NOT be generated.

   Not reporting an interval will result in holes in the associated
   table.  For example, the table, vdslPerfIntervalTable, is indexed 
   by { ifIndex, vdslPhysSide, vdslIntervalNumber }.  If interval 12 
   is determined to be invalid but intervals 11 and 13 are valid, a 
   Get Next operation on the indices .1.1.11 would return indices 
   .1.1.13.

   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure a fixed relationship
   between the start of a fifteen minute and any wall clock; however
   some implementations may align the fifteen minute intervals with
   quarter hours. Likewise, an implementation may choose to align one
   day intervals with the start of a day.

   Counters are not reset when an Vtu is reinitialized, only when the
   agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request outside
   the scope of this MIB).

INTERNET-DRAFT                 VDSL-LINE MIB                  March 2002

4.5.  Profiles

   As a managed node can handle a large number of Vtus, (e.g., hundreds
   or perhaps thousands of lines), provisioning every parameter on every 
   Vtu may become burdensome.  Moreover, most lines are provisioned 
   identically with the same set of parameters.  To simplify the 
   provisioning process, this MIB makes use of profiles.  A profile is a
   set of parameters that can be shared by multiple lines using the same 
   configuration.

   The following profiles are used in this MIB:

   o   Line Configuration Profiles - Line configuration profiles contain
       parameters for configuring VDSL lines.  They are defined in eight
       tables:

       - vdslLineConfProfileTable
       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileTable 
       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxBandTable
       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileRxBandTable
       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxPSDTable 
       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxTxPSDTable 
       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxRxPSDTable 
       - vdslLineSCMConfProfileTable 

       As noted above, the latter seven tables in the above list are
       line code specific.

   o   Alarm Configuration Profiles - These profiles contain parameters 
       for configuring alarm thresholds for VDSL modems.  These profiles
       are defined in the vdslLineAlarmConfProfileTable.

       The index value for this profile is a locally-unique 
       administratively assigned name for the profile having the textual
       convention `SnmpAdminString' (RFC 2571 [1]).

   One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single
   profile (e.g., vdslLineConfProfile = `silver') by setting its 
   vdslLineConfProfile objects to the value of this profile. If a change 
   is made to the profile, all lines that refer to it will be
   reconfigured to the changed parameters.  Before a profile can be 
   deleted or taken out of service it must be first unreferenced from 
   all associated lines.

   Implementations MUST provide a default profile whose name is `DEFVAL'
   for each profile type.  The values of the associated parameters will
   be vendor specific unless otherwise indicated in this document. 
   Before a line's profiles have been set, these profiles will be 
   automatically used by setting vdslLineConfProfile and
   vdslLineAlarmConfProfile to `DEFVAL' where appropriate.  This 
   default profile name, 'DEFVAL', is considered reserved in the context
   of profiles defined in this MIB.

INTERNET-DRAFT                 VDSL-LINE MIB                  March 2002

   Profiles are created, assigned, and deleted dynamically using the
   profile name and profile row status in each of the four profile 
   tables.

   Profile changes MUST take effect immediately.  These changes MAY 
   result in a restart (hard reset or soft restart) of the units on the
   line.

4.6.  Notifications

   The ability to generate the SNMP notifications coldStart/WarmStart
   (per [21]) which are per agent (e.g., per Digital Subscriber Line 
   Access Multiplexer, or DSLAM, in such a device), and linkUp/linkDown
   (per [21]) which are per interface (i.e., VDSL line) is required.

   For Loss of Frame (lof), Loss of Link (lol), Loss of Signal (los),
   and Loss of Power (lpr), 

   A linkDown notification MAY be generated whenever any of lof, lol,
   los, or lpr event occurs.  The corresponding linkUp notification MAY
   be sent when all link failure conditions are cleared.

   The notifications defined in this MIB are for initialization failure
   and for the threshold crossings associated with the following events:
   lof, lol, los, and lpr.  Each threshold has its own enable/threshold 
   value. When that value is 0, the notification is disabled.

   The vdslCurrStatus is a bitmask representing all outstanding error 
   conditions associated with a particular VDSL modem.  Note that since 
   status of remote modems is obtained via the EOC, this information 
   may be unavailable for units that are unreachable via EOC during a 
   line error condition.  Therefore, not all conditions may always be 
   included in its current status.  Notifications corresponding to the 
   bit fields in this object are defined.

   A threshold notification occurs whenever the corresponding current 
   15-minute interval error counter becomes equal to, or exceeds the 
   threshold value. One notification may be sent per interval per 
   interface. Since the current 15-minute counter are reset to 0 every 
   15 minutes, if the condition persists, the notification may recur as 
   often as every 15 minutes.  For example, to get a notification 
   whenever a "loss of" event occurs (but at most once every 15 
   minutes), set the corresponding threshold to 1. The agent will 
   generate a notification when the event originally occurs.

   Note that the Network Management System, or NMS, may receive a 
   linkDown notification, as well, if enabled (via 
   ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable [23]). At the beginning of the next 15 minute 
   interval, the counter is reset.  When the first second goes by and
   the event occurs, the current interval bucket will be 1, which 
   equals the threshold and the notification will be sent again.

    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module defining objects for the management of a pair of
        VDSL modems at each end of the VDSL line.  Each such line has
        an entry in an ifTable which may include multiple modem lines.
        An agent may reside at either end of the VDSL line however the
        MIB is designed to require no management communication between
        them beyond that inherent in the low-level VDSL line protocol.
        The agent may monitor and control this protocol for its needs.

        VDSL lines may support optional Fast or Interleaved channels.
        If these are supported, additional entries corresponding to the
        supported channels must be created in the ifTable. Thus a VDSL
        line that supports both channels will have three entries in the
        ifTable, one for each physical, fast, and interleaved, whose
        ifType values are equal to vdsl(97), fast(125), and
        interleaved(124), respectively. The ifStackTable is used to
        represent the relationship between the entries.
 
        Naming Conventions:
            Vtuc -- (VTUC) modem at near (Central) end of line
            Vtur -- (VTUR) modem at Remote end of line

            stream at the interleaver output.  Larger numbers 
            provide greater separation between consecutive 
            input bytes in the output bit stream allowing for 
            improved impulse noise immunity at the expense of

7.  Security Considerations

   1) Blocking unauthorized access to the VDSL MIB via the element 
   management system is outside the scope of this document. It should
   be noted that access to the MIB permits the unauthorized entity to 
   modify the profiles (section 6.4) such that both subscriber service
   and network operations can be interfered with. Subscriber service 
   can be altered by modifying any of a number of service 
   characteristics such as rate partitioning and maximum transmission
   rates.  Network operations can be impacted by modification of 
   notification thresholds such as lof thresholds.

   2) There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may be 
   considered to contain sensitive information. In particular, the 
   certain objects may be considered sensitive in many environments,
   since it would allow an intruder to obtain information about which 
   vendor's equipment is in use on the network. Therefore, it may be 
   important in some environments to control read access to these

   objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object 
   when sending them over the network via SNMP. Not all versions of 
   SNMP provide features for such a secure environment. 

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security    
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the 
   use of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the 
   View-based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended. 

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals 
   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them. 

   3) VDSL layer connectivity from the Vtur will permit the subscriber 
   to manipulate both the VDSL link directly and the VDSL embedded  
   operations channel (EOC) for their own loop. For example, unchecked 
   or unfiltered fluctuations initiated by the subscriber could generate 
   sufficient notifications to potentially overwhelm either the 
   management interface to the network or the element manager. 

   It should be noted that interface indices in this MIB are maintained
   persistently.  VACM data relating to these should be stored 
   persistently.
