1. Introduction 
   
  IPv6 technology is deployed in many fields. But to provide fine QoS 
  in IPv6 networks, there SHOULD be some signaling mechanisms. So far, 
  IETF have standardized the RSVP [RFC 2205] signaling to support this, 
  but that mechanism is weak for the scalability. With regard to 
  DiffServ [RFC 2475] model, it can solve the scalability problem. But 
  without signaling, it cannot provide the fine QoS. In other field, 
  the MPLS [RFC 3031] with aggregated flow labeling and signaling, such 
  like CR-LDP and RSVP-TE, is a good solution for traffic engineering. 
  Therefore it can accommodate the killer application such as VPN 
  services. 
  To adapt the label switching concept and QoS functionalities, there 
  are some methodologies like IPngLS(IP next generation Label 
  Switching) using flow label field in IPv6 basic header.  
  Someone may want to make use of existing signaling mechanism and the 
  others may prefer new signaling mechanism. We describe the features 
  of new IPv6 signaling to use and distribute the information of flow 
  label and other QoS related parameters. The main issues we are to 
  address here is the label distribution method and QoS information 
  delivering method adopted with IPv6 header including IPv6 extension 
  headers. In order to do this, we suggest the methods how to notify 
  the existence of signaling information to the routers on the path. 
  And the effects of each choice will be discussed.

2. Features and Considerations of IPv6 Signaling 
   
2.1. Features  
   
  o  QoS parameters 
   
  Information with QoS controlling is important context of signaling 
  packet. With aggregated flow concept, IPv6 native signaling can 
  provide finer QoS granularity than DiffServ model, and more scalable 
  than IntServ model.  
   
  o  Resource Reservation 
   
  The key role of signaling is to allocate and reserve the network 
  resource for the purpose of meeting end-to-end QoS requirements along 
  the entire path. The signaling protocol MUST be able to deal with 
  such resource allocation requests. 
   
  o  Priority Flow Control 
   
  Each node has many flows with different priority of various data 
  rates and QoS requirements. These flows are classified and scheduled 
  with the capability of making intelligent decisions on how resource 
  allocation SHOULD be controlled.  
   
  o  Explicit route 
   
  In IPv6 specification, there is a route extension header to use 
  explicit route. Explicit route is important for traffic engineering 
  in IPv6 networks, so we can use of this option header. In doing so, 
  signaling packet specify the route with route extension header and 
  data packet is just switched according to flow label in each router 
  on the path specified with signaling packet. There is already ROUTE 
  object in RSVP-TE specification [RSVP-TE 09]. We will discuss it in 
  section 2.2. 
   
  o  Scalability 
   
  The performance of the signaling SHOULD not largely depend on the 
  scale of the network to which IPv6 is applied (e.g. the number of 
  nodes, the number of physical links etc). The signaling function 
  SHOULD keep constant performance as much as possible regardless of 
  network size. Aggregating flows can reduce resource allocation and 
  runtime management overhead 
   
  o  Flow Label Information Distribution 
   
  To make use of flow label field as mentioned in [IPNGLS 00] and 
  identify the flow label between the routers on specific path, label-
  binding information SHOULD be delivered between the related routers. 
  The related routers are on the path of the flow. 
 
 
Choi et al                                                   [Page  3] 
Internet Draft       The Features of IPv6 Signaling      November 2001 
 
 
  Label value is only meaningful between a pair of routers. And the 
  label value is predetermined before forwarding data packet along the 
  path. 
   
  o  Label Stacking 
   
  In [IPNGLS 00], label stacking concept is addressed. To enable the 
  label stacking, the signaling is defined to notify the stacking 
  information. But we don't consider the concept in this version. 
   
   
2.2. Considerations  
   
  Besides of features of signaling, we must consider the following 
  issues to make the signaling mechanism. 
   
  o  Easy to implements 
   
  There are two aspects related with this issue. First, we can consider 
  the compatibility of the new signaling with existing signaling. So 
  the implementation can be done with minimum modification of previous 
  architecture and components. Second we can omit some functions of 
  previous signaling so that we just make a light-weight signaling 
  mechanism. We are still studying about this carefully because it 
  makes some effects with other various factors such like the 
  capabilities of this new signaling and the signaling translation 
  between two heterogeneous AS's. We can think above two factors 
  simultaneously and SHOULD make some trade-off. 
   
  o  No problems with non-implemented nodes 
   
  To be gradually deployed, we can consider the situation of mixed 
  nodes that some implement the signaling and the other don't implement 
  it. Usually signaling mechanisms are ignoring that node and just 
  forward it.  
   
  o  Make use of IPv6 features 
   
  It is another implementation related issues. IPv6 have a many 
  features to make use of that to provide some new functions. For 
  example, one can want to use the IPv6 Routing Option header to send 
  signaling packet along the desired path rather than the shortest path. 
  This is reasonable because the IPv6 routers may be implement routing 
  option header processing component so we can use that without any 
  additional functional implementations. Also we can think about the 
  hop-by-hop header to notify routers that the packets have some 
  signaling and reservation information. These things are already 
  considered in other signaling mechanism. That means we can use the 
  IPv6 native features or don't use of them. There is another view-
  point related with this. If the same information is transferred with

  IPv6 header and payload, there may exist the consistency problems. So 
  some people want to make one of choices, not both of them. 
   
  o  QoS parameters 
   
  This signaling will apply the QoS parameter per aggregated flow.  
  To make use of this, state of QoS information SHOLD be maintained per 
  aggregated flow. Also the adding and deleting of a flow with respect 
  to the aggregated flow SHOULD be carefully managed. An aggregated 
  flow is not just used for label-related switching, but also used for 
  classification information in routers on path. So the QoS parameter 
  information SHOULD be stored in the router with the information of 
  relation with an aggregated flow identifier(s). 
   
  o  Mobility support 
   
  To provide the QoS in mobile environment, we SHOLD consider the 
  mobility of nodes and dynamic behavior of related flows. In signaling, 
  we are concerning two problems. First the flow management can be 
  considered with per aggregated flow or per flow.  
  In some point, snapshot of network can be described with many 
  aggregated flows and related QoS management. But as time goes, some 
  flow of mobile node is depart one aggregated flow and join the other 
  aggregated flow. Second the support of micro mobility issues. To make 
  use of old flow related resources as much as possible, we should 
  define Nearest Common Router (NCR) and provide the finding mechanism. 
  This work is under working in [RSVP -MIPv6]. We just consider the 
  need of modification or adaptation of that mechanism in our work. 
   
  o  Inter-operation with other QoS-supporting networks 
   
  In this version, we cannot consider this issue.

3. IPv6 Signaling Implementation Issues 
   
  This section is going to discuss two methods for carrying the 
  signaling messages such as RSVP-TE within IPv6 datagrams. Other 
  signaling messages that use TCP or UDP like CR-LDP, SIP are discussed 
  in section 4. 
   
3.1. Using Router Alert Option 
   
  Router alert option [RFC 2711] within the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop option 
  header has the semantic "routers should examine the datagram more 
  closely". Using this option, IPv6 datagrams containing signaling 
  messages are indicated and taken actions. 
   
  The router alert option has the following format: 
   
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |0 0 0|0 0 1 0 1|0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0|        Value (2 octets)       | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
                        length = 2 
   
  The first three bits of the first byte are zero and the value 5 in 
  the remaining five bits is the Hop-by-Hop Option Type number. 
  [RFC 2460] specifies the meaning of the first three bits.  By   
  zeroing all three, this specification requires that nodes not   
  recognizing this option type should skip over this option and 
  continue processing the header and that the option must not change en 
  route. 
   
  There MUST only be one option of this type, regardless of value, 
  per Hop-by-Hop header. 
   
      Value:  A 2 octet code in network byte order with the following 
      values: 
   
        0        Datagram contains a Multicast Listener Discovery 
                 message [RFC 2710]. 
        1        Datagram contains RSVP message. 
        2        Datagram contains an Active Networks message. 
        3-65535  Reserved to IANA for future use. 
   
  Alignment requirement: 2n+0 
   
  Values are registered and maintained by the IANA.   
   
  We suggest the new value (= 3) for RSVP-TE messages. The value 3 is 
  REQUIRED the approval of IETF and SHOULD be assigned by IANA. Other 
  signaling messages MAY be added. In this case, the value for new 
  signaling message SHOULD be assigned by IANA. 
   

 
 
Choi et al                                                   [Page  6] 
Internet Draft       The Features of IPv6 Signaling      November 2001 
 
 
  The described method has some advantages and disadvantages. It is not 
  necessary to implement the new protocol for signaling. The existing 
  signaling message is used without change. However, all IPv6 datagrams 
  containing a signaling message MUST contain this option within the 
  IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option Header of such datagrams. The additional 
  option header is redundant. 
   
   
3.2. Using Internet Signaling Message Protocol (ISMP) 
   
  We propose the new protocol, Internet Signaling Message Protocol 
  (ISMP), for signaling such as the ICMPv6 [RFC 2463]. ISMP is used to   
  carry signaling messages. Every ISMP message is preceded by an IPv6 
  header or by more IPv6 extension headers. The ISMP message is 
  identified by a Next Header value in the immediately preceding header. 
   
  The ISMP messages have the following general format: 
   
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |Version| Traffic Class |           Flow Label                  | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |         Payload Length        |  Next Header  |   Hop Limit   | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |                                                               | 
  +                                                               + 
  |                                                               | 
  +                         Source Address                        + 
  |                                                               | 
  +                                                               + 
  |                                                               | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |                                                               | 
  +                                                               + 
  |                                                               | 
  +                      Destination Address                      + 
  |                                                               | 
  +                                                               + 
  |                                                               | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  +                                                               + 
  |                      ISMP Message Body                        |

      Payload Length       16-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the IPv6         
                           payload, i.e., the rest of the packet 
                           following this IPv6 header, in octets 
       
      Next Header          8-bit selector.  Identifies the type of 
                           signaling message immediately following the 
                           IPv6 header. Uses the same values as the 
                           IPv4 Protocol field [RFC 1700 et seq.]. 
       
      Hop Limit            8-bit unsigned integer.  Decremented by 1 by 
                           each node that forwards the packet. The 
                           packet is discarded if Hop Limit is 
                           decremented to zero. 
       
      Source Address       128-bit address of the originator of the 
                           packet. 
       
      Destination Address  128-bit address of the intended recipient of 
                           the packet (possibly not the ultimate 
                           recipient, if a Routing header is present).   
   
   
  For this method, we MUST assign the new Next Header value of IPv6 
  header. Currently, RSVP is already assigned the value 46 decimal in 
  [RFC 1700].  
   
  For example, if the Next Header value of IPv6 header is 46 decimal 
  the following ISMP message is RSVP message. The Next Header value of 
  other unassigned signaling messages SHOULD be assigned by IANA.  
   
  Compared with the method using router alert option, this method is 
  very simple because of no additional extension header. Therefore, the 
  complexity of processing is reduced but this new function MUST be 
  implemented within IPv6 header.  
   
   
4. Other Issues 
   
  We SHOULD consider the interworking issues for transparent transport 
  of signaling messages between IPv4 and IPv6 network. The mechanisms 
  that carry application-level signaling (ex. SIP) and other signaling 
  (ex. CR-LDP) using TCP or UDP SHOULD also be considered. One of way 
  to do that is that IP header bears the information about the 
  existence of specific signaling packet in the payload. The benefit of 
  this concept is that a router on the path can make decision whether 
  the signaling information is useful for itself and then, consequently, 
  it can check the payload without processing it in upper layer (ex. 
  TCP or UDP). So we are on studying to implement our idea over the 
  existing signaling protocols.

5. IANA Considerations 
   
  The value field described in Section 3 SHOULD be registered and 
  maintained by IANA. The New values SHOULD be to be assigned via IETF 
  Consensus as defined in [RFC 2434].

  requirements using this document are described in the referenced
