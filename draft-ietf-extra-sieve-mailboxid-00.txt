              Sieve Email Filtering: delivery by mailboxid
                  draft-ietf-extra-sieve-mailboxid-00

Abstract

   The OBJECTID capability of the IMAP protocol (RFC8474) allows clients
   to identify mailboxes by a unique identifier which survives rename.

   This document extends the Sieve mail filtering language (RFC5228) to
   allow using that same unique identifier as a target for fileinto
   rules, and for testing the existance of mailboxes.

1.  Introduction

   Sieve rules are sometimes created using graphical interfaces which
   allow users to select the mailbox to be used as a target for a rule.
   If that mailbox is renamed, the client may also update its internal
   representation of the rule and update the sieve script to match,
   however this is a multi-step process and subject to partial failures.
   Also, if the folder is renamed by a different mechanism (e.g. another
   IMAP client) the rules will get out of sync.

   By extending "fileinto" to reference an immutable mailboxid, sieve
   rules can continue to target the same mailbox, even if it gets
   renamed.

2.  Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Sieve capability string

   The server advertises the capability "mailboxid", and scripts which
   use the following extensions MUST explicitly request the capability
   "mailboxid".

   Example:

   require "mailboxid";

4.  Argument ":mailboxid" to Command "fileinto"

   Normally, the "fileinto" command delivers the message in the mailbox
   specified using its positional mailbox argument.  However, if the
   optional ":mailboxid" argument is also specified, the "fileinto"
   command first checks whether a mailbox exists in the user's personal
   namespace [RFC2342] with the specified [RFC8474] MAILBOXID.

   If a matching mailbox is found, that mailbox is used for delivery.

   If there is no such mailbox, the "fileinto" action proceeds as it
   would without the ":mailboxid" argument.

   The tagged argument ":mailboxid" to fileinto consumes one additional
   token, a string with the objectid of the mailbox to file into.

   Example:

   require "fileinto";
   require "mailboxid";

   if header :contains ["from"] "coyote" {
       fileinto :mailboxid "F6352ae03-b7f5-463c-896f-d8b48ee3"
                "INBOX.harassment";
   }

Internet-Draft               Sieve MAILBOXID                   July 2020


4.1.  Interaction with "mailbox" extension

   For servers which also support the [RFC5490] mailbox extension, the
   ":create" modifier to fileinto does not create the mailbox with the
   specified mailboxid, however it may be specified and interacts as
   normal with all other extensions.

   Example:

   require "fileinto";
   require "mailboxid";
   require "mailbox";

   fileinto :mailboxid "Fnosuch"
            :create
            "INBOX.no-such-folder";
               # creates INBOX.no-such-folder, but it doesn't
               # get the "Fnosuch" mailboxid.

4.2.  Interaction with "specialuse" extension

   For servers which also support [RFC8579] delivery to special-use
   mailboxes, if a fileinto command has both ":mailboxid" and ":special-
   use" specified, then the mailboxid is resolved first.

   If a mailbox with the specified mailboxid does not exist, then the
   process specified in [RFC8579] is followed - which includes
   processing of [RFC5490] ":create" tags to add the special-use to the
   created mailbox.

   Example:

   require "fileinto";
   require "mailboxid";
   require "special-use";
   if header :contains ["from"] "coyote" {
       fileinto :mailboxid "F6352ae03-b7f5-463c-896f-d8b48ee3"
                :specialuse "\\Junk"
                "INBOX.harassment";
   }

Internet-Draft               Sieve MAILBOXID                   July 2020


   require "fileinto";
   require "mailboxid";
   require "mailbox";
   require "special-use";

   fileinto :mailboxid "F1234567"
            :specialuse "\\Archive"
            :create
            "INBOX.Archive";
               # creates INBOX.Archive with use \Archive but
               # with a different mailboxid.

4.3.  Interaction with "fcc" extension

   This document extends the definition of the ":fcc" argument defined
   in [RFC8580] so that it can optionally be used with the ":mailboxid"
   argument.

   FCC =/ [":mailboxid" <mailboxid: string>]

   If the optional ":mailboxid" argument is specified with ":fcc", it
   instructs the Sieve interpreter to check whether a mailbox exists
   with the specific mailboxid.  If such a mailbox exists, the generated
   message is filed into that mailbox.  Otherwise, the generated message
   is filed into the ":fcc" target mailbox.

   Example:

   require ["enotify", "fcc", "mailboxid"];
   notify :fcc "INBOX.Sent"
          :mailboxid "F6352ae03-b7f5-463c-896f-d8b48ee3"
          :message "You got mail!"
          "mailto:ken@example.com";

5.  Test ":mailboxidexists"

   The "mailboxidexists" test is true if all mailboxes listed in the
   "mailboxids" argument exist in the mailstore, and each allows the
   user in whose context the Sieve script runs to "deliver" messages
   into it.  When the mailstore is an IMAP server, "delivery" of
   messages is possible if:

   a) the READ-WRITE response code is present for the mailbox (see
   Section 7.1 of [RFC3501]), if IMAP Access Control List (ACL)
   [RFC4314] is not supported by the server, or

   b) the user has 'p' or 'i' rights for the mailbox (see Section 5.2 of
   [RFC4314]).

Internet-Draft               Sieve MAILBOXID                   July 2020


   Note that a successful "mailboxidexists" test for a mailbox doesn't
   necessarily mean that a "fileinto :mailboxid" action on this mailbox
   would succeed.  For example, the "fileinto" action might put user
   over quota.  The "mailboxidexists" test only verifies existence of
   the mailbox and whether the user in whose context the Sieve script
   runs has permissions to execute "fileinto" on it.

   Example:

   require "fileinto";
   require "mailboxid";

   if header :contains ["from"] "coyote" {
       if mailboxidexists "F6352ae03-b7f5-463c-896f-d8b48ee3" {
           fileinto :mailboxid "F6352ae03-b7f5-463c-896f-d8b48ee3"
                               "INBOX.harassment";
       } else {
           fileinto "INBOX.harassment";
       }
   }

   Note to implementers: this test behaves identically to the
   "mailboxexists" test defined in [RFC5490] but operates on mailboxids
   rather than mailbox names.

6.  Interaction with variables extension

   There is no special interaction defined, however as an objectid is a
   string in this document, objectid values can contain variable
   expansions if [RFC5229] is enabled.

7.  Formal Syntax

   test /= "mailboxidexists" string-list

   tag /= ":mailboxid" string

   If [I-D.ietf-extra-sieve-fcc] is supported:

   FCC =/ [":mailboxid" <mailboxid: string>]

8.  Security considerations

   Because mailboxid is always generated by the server, implementations
   MUST NOT allow sieve to make an endrun around this protection by
   creating mailboxes with the specified ID by using ":create" and
   ":mailboxid" in a fileinto rule for a non-existant mailbox.

9.  IANA considerations

   IANA are requested to add a capability to the sieve-extensions
   registry:

   To: iana@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of new Sieve extension

   Capability name: mailboxid
   Description: adds a test for checking mailbox existence by objectid,
                and new optional arguments to fileinto and :fcc which
                allow selecting the destination mailbox by objectid.

10.  Acknowledgements

   This document borrows heavily from [RFC5490] for the matching
   mailboxexists test, and from [I-D.ietf-extra-sieve-special-use] for
   an example of modifying the fileinto command.
