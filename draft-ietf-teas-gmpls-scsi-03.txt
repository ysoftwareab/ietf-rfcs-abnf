   Generalized Interface Switching Capability Descriptor - Switching
                    Capability Specific Information
                     draft-ietf-teas-gmpls-scsi-03

Abstract

   This document defines a generic information structure for information
   carried in routing protocol Interface Switching Capability Descriptor
   (ISCD) Switching Capability Specific Information (SCSI) fields.  This
   "Generalized SCSI" can be used with routing protocols that define
   GMPLS ISCDs, and any specific technology.  This document does not
   modify any existing technology specific formats and is defined for
   use in conjunction with new GMPLS Switching Capability types.  The
   context for this document is Generalized MPLS, and the reader is
   expected to be familiar with the GMPLS architecture and associate
   protocol standards.

1.  Introduction

   The context for this document is Generalized MPLS, and the reader is
   expected to be familiar with the GMPLS architecture, associate
   terminology and protocol standards.  Notably, but not limited to,
   [RFC3945], [RFC4202], [RFC4203] and [RFC5307].

   The Interface Switching Capability Descriptor (ISCD) [RFC4202] allows
   routing protocols such as OSPF and ISIS to carry technology specific
   information in the the Switching Capability-specific information
   (SCSI) field, see [RFC4203] and [RFC5307].  The format of an SCSI
   field is dictated by the specific technology being represented as
   indicated by the ISCD Switching Capability (SC) type field.  Existing
   Switching Capabilities are managed by IANA in the Switching Types
   registry [1] and the related "IANA-GMPLS-TC-MIB" definitions.

   [RFC7138] introduced a "sub-TLV" structure to its technology specific
   SCSI field.  The Sub-Type-Length-Value (TLV) based approach allows
   for greater flexibility in the structure, ordering, and ability to
   support extensions of the SC (technology) specific format.  This Sub-
   TLV approach is also used in [RFC7688].

   This document generalizes this approach and defines a new generalized
   SCSI field format for use by future specific technologies and
   Switching Capability types.  The generalized SCSI carries SCSI-TLVs

   that may be defined within the scope of a specific technology, or
   shared across multiple technologies (e.g.,
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-ospf-availability-extension]).  This document also
   establishes a registry for SCSI-TLV definitions that may be shared
   across multiple technologies.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The reader is expected to be familiar with GMPLS terminology, e.g. as
   found in [RFC3945], as well as the terminology used in [RFC4202],
   [RFC4203] and [RFC5307].

3.  Generalized SCSI Formats

   The Generalized SCSI is composed of zero or more variable length
   type-length-value fields which are each called a SCSI-TLV.  There are
   no specific size restrictions on these SCSI-TLV.  Size and other
   formatting restrictions may be imposed by the routing protocol ISCD
   field, refer to [RFC4203] and [RFC5307].

   The SCSI-TLV format is:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |             Type              |             Length            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       ...                           Value                           ...
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                           Figure 1: TLV format

   Type (2 octets):
      This field indicates the type and structure of the information
      contained in the Value field.

   Length (2 octets):
      This field MUST be set to the size, in octets (bytes), of the
      Value field.  The value of the field MUST be zero or divisible by
      4.  Note that this implies that the Value field can be omitted or
      contain padding.

Internet-Draft              Generalized SCSI                   June 2017


   Value (variable):
      A variable length field, formatted according to the definition
      indicated by value of the Type field.  This field can be omitted
      for certain types.

4.  Procedures

   The ISCD can include a Generalized SCSI when advertising technologies
   whose Switching Capability definition references this document.  The
   corollary of this is that the Generalized SCSI MUST NOT be used for
   ISCDs of technologies whose Switching Capability definition do not
   reference this document.

   The Generalized SCSI MAY contain a sequence of zero or more SCSI-
   TLVs.  Sub-TLV parsing (format) errors, such as an underrun or
   overrun, MUST be treated as a malformed ISCD.  SCSI-TLVs MUST be
   processed in the order received and, if re-originated, ordering MUST
   be preserved.  Unknown SCSI-TLVs MUST be ignored and transparently
   processed, i.e., re-originated when appropriate.  Processing related
   to multiple SCSI-TLVs of the same type may be further refined based
   on the definition on the type.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security issue beyond those
   discussed in [RFC4203] and [RFC5307].  As discussed there, the
   information carried in ISCDs are not used for SPF computation or
   normal routing and the extensions here defined do not have direct
   effect on IP routing.  Tampering with GMPLS TE LSAs may have an
   effect on the underlying transport network.  Mechanisms such as
   [RFC2154] and [RFC5304] to protect the transmission of this
   information are suggested.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new SCSI-TLV that is carried in the SCSI
   field of the ISCDs defined in [RFC4203] and [RFC5307].  The SCSI-TLV
   includes a 16-bit type identifier (the Type field).  The same Type
   field values are applicable to the new SCSI-TLV.

   IANA is requested to create and maintain a new registry, the
   "Generalized SCSI (Switching Capability Specific Information) TLVs
   Types" registry under either the the "Generalized Multi-Protocol
   Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters" registry or a new
   "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Routing
   Parameters" registry, at their desecration.

   The definition of the new registry is as follows:

Internet-Draft              Generalized SCSI                   June 2017


       Value       SCSI-TLV                Switching Type   Reference
       ---------   ----------------------- --------------   ---------
       0           Reserved                                 [This ID]
       1-65535     Unassigned              (value list)     [This ID]


   New allocation requests to this registry must indicate the value or
   values to be used in the Switching Type column.

   The registry should be established with registration policies of
   "Specification Required", see [RFC5226].

   REMOVE THIS AFTER PUBLICATION: The designated expert will be
   appointed by the Routing AD.  It is suggested to appoint any current
   TEAS WG chair.
