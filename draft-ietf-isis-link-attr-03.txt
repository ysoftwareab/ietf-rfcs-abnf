1.  Introduction

   [IS-IS] specifies the IS-IS protocol (ISO 10589) with extensions to
   support IPv4 in [RFC1195].  A router advertises one or several Link
   State Protocol data units which are composed of variable length
   tuples called TLVs (Type-Length-Value).

   [RFC3784] defines a set of new TLVs whose aims are to add more
   information about links characteristics, increase the range of IS-IS
   metrics and optimize the encoding of IS-IS prefixes.

   This document defines a new sub-TLV named "Link-attributes" carried
   within the extended IS reachability TLV (type 22) specified in
   [RFC3784].


2.  Link-attributes sub-TLV format

   The link-attribute sub-TLV is carried within the TLV 22 and has a
   format identical to the sub-TLV format used by the Traffic
   Engineering Extensions for IS-IS ([RFC3784]): 1 octet of sub-type, 1
   octet of length of the value field of the sub-TLV followed by the
   value field - in this case, a 16 bit flags field.

   The Link-attribute sub-type is 19 (to be assigned by IANA) and has a
   length of 2 octets.

   This sub-TLV is OPTIONAL and MUST appear at most once for a single IS
   neighbor.  If a received LSP contains more than one Link-Attribute
   Sub-TLV, an implementation MAY decide to consider only the first
   encountered instance.

   The following bits are defined:

   Local Protection Available (0x01).  When set, this indicates that the
   link is protected by means of some local protection mechanism (e.g
   [RFC4090]).

   Link excluded from local protection path (0x02).  When set, this link
   SHOULD not be included in any computation of a repair path by any
   other router in the routing area.  The triggers for setting up this
   bit are out of the scope of this document.


3.  Interoperability with routers non supporting this capability

   A router not supporting the link-attribute sub-TLV will just silently
   ignore this sub-TLV.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will assign a new codepoint for the link-attribute sub-TLV
   defined in this document and carried within TLV 22.  Suggested value
   is 19 (to be assigned by IANA).

   IANA is requested to create a registry for bit values inside the
   link-attributes sub-TLV.  The initial contents of this registry will
   be:

   Value   Name                                Reference
     -----   ----                                ---------
     0x1     Local Protection Available          [This Document]
     0x2     Link Excluded from Local Protection [This Document]

   Further values are to be allocated by the Standards Action process
   defined in [RFC2434], with Early Allocation (defined in [RFC4020])
   permitted.


5.  Security Considerations

   Any new security issues raised by the procedures in this document
   depend upon the opportunity for LSPs to be snooped and modified, the
   ease/difficulty of which has not been altered.  As the LSPs may now
   contain additional information regarding router capabilities, this
   new information would also become available to an attacker.
   Specifications based on this mechanism need to describe the security
   considerations around the disclosure and modification of their
   information.  Note that an integrity mechanism, such as one defined
   in [RFC3567] should be applied if there is high risk resulting from
   modification of capability information.
