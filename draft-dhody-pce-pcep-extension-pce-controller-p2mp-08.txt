 Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Procedures and
 Extensions for Using the PCE as a Central Controller (PCECC) of point-
                       to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs
         draft-dhody-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-p2mp-08

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-
   Defined Networking (SDN) systems.

   The PCE has been identified as an appropriate technology for the
   determination of the paths of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs).

   A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of
   a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and
   without necessarily completely replacing it.  Thus, the P2MP LSP can
   be calculated/set up/initiated and the label-forwarding entries can
   also be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network
   device along the P2MP path, while leveraging the existing PCE
   technologies as much as possible.

   This document specifies the procedures and Path Computation Element
   Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions for using the PCE as the
   central controller for provisioning labels along the path of the
   static P2MP LSP.

1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] was developed to offload
   the path computation function from routers in an MPLS traffic-
   engineered (TE) network.  It can compute optimal paths for traffic
   across a network and can also update the paths to reflect changes in
   the network or traffic demands.  Since then, the role and function of
   the PCE have grown to cover a number of other uses (such as GMPLS
   [RFC7025]) and to allow delegated control [RFC8231] and PCE-initiated
   use of network resources [RFC8281].

   According to [RFC7399], Software-Defined Networking (SDN) refers to a
   separation between the control elements and the forwarding components
   so that software running in a centralized system, called a
   controller, can act to program the devices in the network to behave
   in specific ways.  A required element in an SDN architecture is a
   component that plans how the network resources will be used and how
   the devices will be programmed.  It is possible to view this
   component as performing specific computations to place traffic flows
   within the network given knowledge of the availability of network
   resources, how other forwarding devices are programmed, and the way
   that other flows are routed.  This is the function and purpose of a
   PCE, and the way that a PCE integrates into a wider network control
   system (including an SDN system) is presented in [RFC7491].

Internet-Draft                 PCECC-P2MP                     March 2022


   In early PCE implementations, where the PCE was used to derive paths
   for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), paths were requested by network
   elements (known as Path Computation Clients (PCCs)), and the results
   of the path computations were supplied to network elements using the
   Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440].
   This protocol was later extended to allow a PCE to send unsolicited
   requests to the network for LSP establishment [RFC8281].

   [RFC8283] introduces the architecture for PCE as a central controller
   as an extension of the architecture described in [RFC4655] and
   assumes the continued use of PCEP as the protocol used between PCE
   and PCC.  [RFC8283] further examines the motivations and
   applicability for PCEP as a Southbound Interface (SBI), and
   introduces the implications for the protocol.

   A PCECC can simplify the processing of a distributed control plane by
   blending it with elements of SDN and without necessarily completely
   replacing it.  Thus, the LSP can be calculated/set up/initiated and
   the label-forwarding entries can also be downloaded through a
   centralized PCE server to each network device along the path while
   leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much as possible.

   [RFC9050] specify the procedures and PCEP extensions for using the
   PCE as the central controller for static P2P LSPs, where LSPs can be
   provisioned as explicit label instructions at each hop on the end-to-
   end path.  Each router along the path must be told what label-
   forwarding instructions to program and what resources to reserve.
   The PCE-based controller keeps a view of the network and determines
   the paths of the end-to-end LSPs, and the controller uses PCEP to
   communicate with each router along the path of the end-to-end LSP.

   [RFC4857] describes how to set up point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) for use in Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.  The
   PCE has been identified as a suitable application for the computation
   of paths for P2MP TE LSPs ([RFC5671]).  The extensions of PCEP to
   request path computation for P2MP TE LSPs are described in [RFC8306].
   Further [RFC8623] specify the extensions that are necessary in order
   for the deployment of stateful PCEs to support P2MP TE LSPs as well
   as the setup, maintenance and teardown of PCE-initiated P2MP LSPs
   under the stateful PCE model.

Internet-Draft                 PCECC-P2MP                     March 2022


   This document extends [RFC9050] to specify the procedures and PCEP
   extensions for using the PCE as the central controller for static
   P2MP LSPs, where LSPs can be provisioned as explicit label
   instructions at each hop on the end-to-end path with an added
   functionality of a P2MP branch node.  As per [RFC4875], a branch node
   is an LSR that replicates the incoming data on to one or more
   outgoing interfaces.  [I-D.ietf-teas-pcecc-use-cases] describes the
   use cases for P2MP in PCECC architecture.

2.  Terminology

   Terminologies used in this document is the same as described in the
   draft [RFC8283].

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Basic PCECC Mode

   Section 3 of [RFC9050] describe the PCECC model of operation.

   This document extends the functionality to include support for
   central control instruction for replication at the branch nodes for
   the P2MP LSP.

   The rest of the processing at the root node is similar to the
   existing stateful PCE mechanism for P2MP [RFC8623].

4.  Procedures for Using the PCE as a Central Controller (PCECC) for
    P2MP

4.1.  Stateful PCE Model

   Active stateful PCE is described in [RFC8231] and extended for P2MP
   [RFC8623].  A PCE as a Central Controller (PCECC) reuses the existing
   active stateful PCE mechanism as much as possible to control the
   LSPs.

   [RFC9050] extends PCEP messages - PCInitiate, PCRpt, and PCUpd
   message for the Central Controller's Instructions (CCI) (label-
   forwarding instructions in the context of this document).  This
   document specify the procedure for additional instruction for branch
   node needed for P2MP.

4.2.  PCECC Capability Advertisement

   As per Section 5.4 of [RFC9050], during the PCEP initialization
   phase, PCEP Speakers (PCE or PCC) advertise their support of and
   willingness to use PCEP extension for the PCECC using a new Path
   Setup Type (PST) in PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV and a new PCECC-
   CAPABILITY sub-TLV.

   A new M bit is added in the PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV to indicate
   support for PCECC-P2MP.  A PCC MUST set the M bit in the PCECC-
   CAPABILITY sub-TLV and include STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV with the
   P2MP bits set (as per [RFC8623]) in the OPEN object to support the
   PCECC P2MP extensions defined in this document.

   If the M bit is set in PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV and the STATEFUL-PCE-
   CAPABILITY TLV is not advertised, or is advertised without the N bit
   set, in the OPEN object, the receiver MUST:

   *  send a PCErr message with Error-Type=19 (Invalid Operation) and
      Error-value=TBD2 (P2MP capability was not advertised) and

   *  terminate the session.

   The rest of the processing is as per [RFC9050].

4.3.  LSP Operations

   The PCEP messages pertaining to a PCECC includes the PATH-SETUP-TYPE
   TLV [RFC8408] in the SRP object [RFC8231] with the PST set to '2' to
   clearly identify the the PCECC LSP is intended as per [RFC9050].

4.3.1.  PCE-Initiated PCECC LSP

   The LSP instantiation operation is the same as defined in [RFC8281]
   and [RFC8623].

   In order to set up a PCE-Initiated P2MP LSP based on the PCECC
   mechanism, a PCE sends a PCInitiate message with the PST set to '2'
   for the PCECC ([RFC9050]) to the ingress PCC (root node).

   As described in [RFC9050], the label-forwarding instructions from
   PCECC are sent after the initial PCInitiate and PCRpt exchange.  This
   is done so that the PCEP-specific identifier for the LSP (PLSP-ID)
   and other LSP identifiers can be obtained from the ingress and can be
   included in the label-forwarding instruction in the next set of
   PCInitiate message along the path.

Internet-Draft                 PCECC-P2MP                     March 2022


   An P2MP-LSP-IDENTIFIER TLV [RFC8623] MUST be included for the PCECC
   P2MP LSPs, it uniquely identifies the P2MP LSP in the network.  As
   per [RFC9050], the LSP object is included in the central controller's
   instructions (label download) to identify the PCECC P2MP LSP for this
   instruction.  The handling of PLSP-ID is as per [RFC9050].

   The ingress PCC (root) also sets the D (Delegate) flag (see
   [RFC8231]) and C (Create) flag (see [RFC8281]) in the LSP object of
   the PCRpt message.  As per [RFC9050], when the PCE receives this
   PCRpt message with the PLSP-ID, it assigns labels along the path and
   sets up the path by sending a PCInitiate message to each node along
   the path of the P2MP Tree as per the PCECC technique.  The CC-ID
   uniquely identifies the central controller instruction within a PCEP
   session.  Each node along the path (PCC) responds with the PCRpt
   messages to acknowledge the CCI with the PCRpt messages including the
   CCI and the LSP objects.  The only new extension required is the
   instructions on the branch nodes for replications to more than one
   outgoing interface with the respective label.  The rest of the
   operations remains the same as [RFC9050] and [RFC8623].

4.3.2.  PCC-Initiated PCECC LSP

   In order to set up a P2MP LSP based on the PCECC mechanism where the
   LSP is configured at the PCC, a PCC MUST delegate the P2MP LSP by
   sending a PCRpt message with the PST set for the PCECC and D
   (Delegate) flag (see [RFC8623]) set in the LSP object.

   When a PCE receives the initial PCRpt message with the D flags and
   PST Type set to '2', it SHOULD calculate the P2MP tree and assign
   labels along the P2MP tree in addition to setting up the P2MP LSP by
   sending PCInitiate message to each node along the path of the P2MP
   LSP as per [RFC9050].  The only new extension required is the
   instructions on the branch nodes for replications to more than one
   outgoing interface with the respective label.  The rest of the
   operations remains the same as [RFC9050] and [RFC8623].

4.3.3.  Central Control Instructions

   The CCI for the label operations in PCEP are done via the PCInitiate
   message as described in [RFC9050], by defining a PCEP Objects for CCI
   operations.  The local label range of each PCC is assumed to be known
   by both the PCC and the PCE.

4.3.3.1.  Label Download CCI

   In order to set up an LSP based on the PCECC, the PCE sends a
   PCInitiate message to each node along the path to download the label
   instructions, as described in Section 4.3.1 and Section 4.3.2.

Internet-Draft                 PCECC-P2MP                     March 2022


   The CCI object MUST be included, along with the LSP object in the
   PCInitiate message.  As per [RFC9050], there are at most 2 instances
   of CCI object in the PCInitiate message.  For PCECC-P2MP operations,
   multiple instances of CCI object for out-labels is allowed.
   Similarly to acknowledge the central controller instructions, the
   PCRpt message allows multiple instances of CCI object for PCECC-P2MP
   operations.

   The P2MP-LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV MUST be included in the LSP object for
   the PCECC based P2MP LSP.  The SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID TLV SHOULD be
   included in LSP object.

   As described in [RFC9050], if a node (PCC) receives a PCInitiate
   message that includes a label to download (as part of CCI) that is
   out of the range set aside for the PCE, it send a PCErr message with
   Error-type=3 (PCECC failure) and Error-value=1 (Label out of range)
   ([RFC9050]).  If a PCC receives a PCInitiate message but fails to
   download the label entry, it sends a PCErr message with Error-type=3
   (PCECC failure) and Error-value=2 (Instruction failed) ([RFC9050]).

   R2 are same as [RFC9050].  The branch node (R2) needs to be
   instructed to replicate two copies of the incoming packet, and sent
   towards R4 and R5 with 9001 and 9002 labels respectively).  This done
   via including 3 instances of CCI objects in the PCEP messages, one
   for each label in the example, 6000 for incoming and 9001/9002 for
   outgoing (along with remote nexthop).  The message and procedure
   remains exactly as [RFC9050] with only distinction that more than one
   outgoing CCI MAY be present for the P2MP LSP.

4.3.3.2.  Label Cleanup CCI

   In order to delete a P2MP LSP based on the PCECC, the PCE sends a
   Central Controller Instructions via a PCInitiate message to each node
   along the path of the P2MP tree to clean up the label-forwarding
   instruction as per [RFC9050].  In case of branch nodes, all instances
   of CCIs needs to be present in the PCEP message.

4.3.4.  PCECC LSP Update

   In case of a modification of PCECC P2MP LSP with a new path, the
   procedure, and instructions as described in [RFC9050] apply.

4.3.5.  Re-delegation and Cleanup

   In case of a re-delegation and clean up of PCECC P2MP LSP, the
   procedure, and instructions as described in [RFC9050] apply.

4.3.6.  Synchronization of Central Controllers Instructions

   The procedure and instructions are as per [RFC9050].

4.3.7.  PCECC LSP State Report

   An ingress PCC MAY choose to apply any Operations, Administration,
   and Maintenance (OAM) mechanism to check the status of the LSP in the
   data plane and MAY further send its status in the PCRpt message (as
   per [RFC8623]) to the PCE.

4.3.8.  PCC-Based Allocations

   The PCE can request the PCC to allocate the label using the
   PCInitiate message.  The procedure and instructions are as per
   Section 5.5.8 of [RFC9050].

5.  PCEP Messages

   [RFC9050] specify the extension to PCInitiate and PCRpt message for
   PCECC.  For P2P LSP, only two instances of CCI objects can be
   included.  In the case of the P2MP LSP, multiple CCI objects are
   allowed.  The message format and other procedures continue to apply.

6.  PCEP Objects

6.1.  OPEN Object

6.1.1.  PCECC Capability sub-TLV

   The PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV is an optional TLV for use in the OPEN
   Object for PCECC capability advertisement in PATH-SETUP-TYPE-
   CAPABILITY TLV as specified in [RFC9050].

   This document adds a new flag (M Bit) in the PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV
   to indicate the support for P2MP in PCECC.

   M (PCECC-P2MP-CAPABILITY - 1 bit - TBD1): If set to 1 by a PCEP
   speaker, it indicates that the PCEP speaker is capable of PCECC-P2MP
   capability.

   A PCC MUST set the M Bit in the PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV and set the
   N (P2MP-CAPABILITY), the M (P2MP-LSP-UPDATE-CAPABILITY), and the P
   (P2MP-LSP-INSTANTIATION-CAPABILITY) bits (as per [RFC8623]) in the
   STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV [RFC8231] to support the PCECC-P2MP
   extensions defined in this document.  If the M Bit is set in PCECC-
   CAPABILITY sub-TLV and the P2MP bits (in the STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY
   TLV) are not set in the OPEN Object, a PCEP speaker SHOULD send a
   PCErr message with Error-Type=19 (Invalid Operation) and Error-
   value=TBD2 (P2MP capability was not advertised) and terminate the
   session.

6.2.  PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV

   The PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV is defined in [RFC8408]; [RFC9050] defines a
   PST value for PCECC as '2', which is applicable for P2MP LSP as well.

6.3.  CCI Object

   The CCI object [RFC9050] is used by the PCE to specify the forwarding
   instructions (label information in the context of this document) to
   the PCC, and optionally carried within PCInitiate or PCRpt message
   for label download/report.  The CCI Object Type 1 for MPLS Label is
   defined in [RFC9050], which is used for the P2MP LSPs as well.  The
   address TLVs are defined in [RFC9050], they associate the next-hop

   information in case of an outgoing label.

   If a node (PCC) receives a PCInitiate message with more than one CCI
   with O-bit set for the outgoing label and the node does not support
   the P2MP branch/replication capability, it MUST respond with PCErr
   message with Error-Type=2 (Capability not supported) (defined in
   [RFC5440]).

   The rest of the processing is same as [RFC9050].

7.  Security Considerations

   As per [RFC8283], the security considerations for a PCE-based
   controller are a little different from those for any other PCE
   system.  That is, the operation relies heavily on the use and
   security of PCEP, so consideration should be given to the security
   features discussed in [RFC5440] and the additional mechanisms
   described in [RFC8253].  It further lists the vulnerability of a
   central controller architecture, such as a central point of failure,
   denial of service, and a focus for interception and modification of
   messages sent to individual Network Elements (NEs).

   The security considerations described in [RFC8231], [RFC8281],
   [RFC8623], and [RFC9050] apply to the extensions described in this
   document.

   As per [RFC8231], it is RECOMMENDED that these PCEP extensions only
   be activated on authenticated and encrypted sessions across PCEs and
   PCCs belonging to the same administrative authority, using Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8253] as per the recommendations and best
   current practices in [RFC7525] (unless explicitly set aside in
   [RFC8253]).

8.  Manageability Considerations

8.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   A PCE or PCC implementation SHOULD allow to configure to enable/
   disable PCECC-P2MP capability as a global configuration.

8.2.  Information and Data Models

   [RFC7420] describes the PCEP MIB, this MIB can be extended to get the
   PCECC capability status.

   The PCEP YANG module [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang] could be extended to
   enable/disable PCECC-P2MP capability.

8.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440].

8.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC5440] and [RFC8231].

8.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   PCEP extensions defined in this document do not put new requirements
   on other protocols.

8.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   PCEP extensions defined in this document do not put new requirements
   on network operations.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV

   [RFC9050] defines the PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV and requests that IANA
   creates a registry to manage the value of the PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-
   TLV's Flag field.  IANA is requested to allocate a new bit in the
   PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV Flag Field registry, as follows:

                  +======+=============+===============+
                  | Bit  | Description | Reference     |
                  +======+=============+===============+
                  | TBD1 | P2MP        | This document |
                  +------+-------------+---------------+

                                 Table 1

9.2.  PCEP-Error Object

   IANA is requested to allocate a new error value within the "PCEP-
   ERROR Object Error Types and Values" sub-registry of the PCEP Numbers
   registry for the following errors:

   Error-Type   Meaning
   ---------- -------
   19           Invalid operation.
