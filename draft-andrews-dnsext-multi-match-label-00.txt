               draft-andrews-dnsext-multi-match-label-00

Abstract

   Idn users have expressed a need to have multiple labels be treated as
   one in the DNS.  This document presents a method to do this by
   defining a new label type that ties a set of labels together that
   need to be treated indentically.

Internet-Draft              Multi Match Label                  July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Multi Match Labels (MML) are intended to be used in owner names of
   records in the DNS to combine RFC 1035 labels that should be treated
   identically in a zone.


2.  Wire Format

   The MML has label type {TBD}.  Following the label type there is a
   count of the number of sub labels, upto 255, (Note we could reduce
   this below 63 and encode in the first octet) followed by a series of
   RFC 1035 sub labels that make up the MML.

                                       1  1  1  1  1  1
         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |      TBD              |     COUNT             |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |     LEN               |                       |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+                       |
       /              SUB LABEL                        /
       |                       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |                       |     LEN               |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--|
       |                                               |
       /              SUB LABEL                        /
       /                                               /
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   When used in a domain name, MMLs extend the maximum length of a
   domain name to 1024 octets with the restriction that all domain names
   constructed using the MML are still restricted to 255 octets.  The
   makes the effective length of the MML be the length of the longest
   sub label in the MML.


3.  Master File Format

   [To be fully described].

   e.g. {sublabel1,sublabel2,sublabel3}


4.  Signaling client support for MML

   Client side support for MML support is signaled using EDNS version 1.
   Clients that do not signal that they support MML labels will receive

   the RFC 1035 sub labels that match the query name.


5.  Interaction with DNSSEC

   The cannonical format of a MML is the MML with each sub label in
   cannonical format as per RFC 4035.

   Zones that use MML labels need to use DNSSEC algorithm types that
   signal the potential use of MML.  MML zones are treated as insecure
   by validators that are not MML aware.

   NSEC and NSEC3 chains are constructed as if all of the combinations
   of names in owner name exists seperately for all MMLs within the
   zone.  MMLs within the zone name are NOT expanded but are kept as
   MMLs.  This permits name error (NXDOMAIN) to be returned.

   If the zone name contains MMLs the signer name and be any of the RFC
   1035 names the MML maps to.


6.  Interaction with non MML parent zones

   The parent zone delegates each of the zone names that makes up the
   names in the MML named zone.


7.  Interaction with non MML child zones

   The child server implements all of the potential zones names.


8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD


9.  Security Considerations

   TBD
