1.  Introduction

   This specification defines and adds the following additional link
   relation types to the IANA Registry of Link Relations established by
   [RFC5988]: to, bto, cc, bcc, from, bfrom, source, scope, generator,
   provider, location, alias and mentioned-by.

   Note that this document is a work-in-progress draft specification
   that does not yet represent a "standard".  It is the intention of
   this specification to propose a few new ideas and openly solicit
   feedback on their definition and use.  While this document might
   eventually evolve into an RFC the ideas described herein have not yet
   been broadly implemented and have definitions that may evolve through
   successive iterations of this draft.

2.  IANA Considerations

   The following Link Relations are added to the IANA Registry of Link
   Relations:

   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
   | Name           | Description                                      |
   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
   | id             | Specifies an IRI [RFC3987] or URI                |
   |                | [RFC3986]considered to represent the identity of |
   |                | the link context.                                |
   | to             | Refers to a resource that is considered to be    |
   |                | part of the public primary audience of the       |
   |                | link's context.                                  |
   | bto            | Refers to a resource that is considered to be    |
   |                | part of the private primary audience of the      |
   |                | link's context.                                  |
   | cc             | Refers to a resource that is considered to be    |
   |                | part of the public secondary audience of the     |
   |                | link's context.                                  |
   | bcc            | Refers to a resource that is considered to be    |
   |                | part of the private secondary audience of the    |
   |                | link's context.                                  |
   | from           | Refers to a resource that is publicly considered |
   |                | to be the originator of the link's context.      |
   | bfrom          | Refers to a resource that is privately           |
   |                | considered to be the orignator of the link's     |
   |                | context.                                         |
   | scope          | Refers to a resource that identifies the total   |

   |                | population of entities for which the context is  |
   |                | considered relevant.                             |
   | source         | Refers to the original source of information     |
   |                | contained by the context resource.               |
   | provider       | Refers to the resource that provided the context |
   |                | resource.  Typically, this would be used to      |
   |                | identify the entity publishing the resource.     |
   | generator      | Refers to the resource that generated the        |
   |                | context resource.  Typically, this would be used |
   |                | to identify the software application that        |
   |                | created the context resource.                    |
   | mentioned-by   | Refers to a resource that mentions the context   |
   |                | resource in some fashion. This, for example,     |
   |                | would be used when an article mentions another   |
   |                | article, or a social status update mentions a    |
   |                | particular user, etc.                            |
   | location       | References an IRI or URI representing a physical |
   |                | or logical location with which the context       |
   |                | resource is associated.                          |
