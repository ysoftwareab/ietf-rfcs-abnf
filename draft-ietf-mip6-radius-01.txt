Internet-Draft         RADIUS Mobile IPv6 Support           October 2006


Abstract

   A Mobile IPv6 node requires a home agent(HA) address, a home
   address(HOA), and IPsec security association with its HA before it
   can start utilizing Mobile IPv6 service.  RFC 3775 requires that some
   or all of these parameters are statically configured.  Ongoing work
   aims to make this information dynamically available to the mobile
   node.  An important aspect of the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping solution
   is to support interworking with existing authentication,
   authorization and accounting (AAA) infrastructure.  This document
   defines new attributes to facilitate Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping via a
   RADIUS infrastructure.  This information exchange may take place as
   part of the initial network access authentication procedure or as
   part of a separate protocol exchange between the mobile node, the HA
   and the AAA infrastructure.

1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 specification [5] requires a Mobile Node (MN) to perform
   registration with a HA with information about its current point of
   attachment (Care-of Address).  The HA creates and maintains binding
   between the MN's HOA and the MN's Care-of Address.

   In order to register with a HA, the MN needs to know some information
   such as, the Home Link prefix, the HA Address, the HOA, the Home Link
   prefix Length and security related information in order to secure the
   Binding Update.

   The aforementioned set of information may be statically provisioned
   in the MN.  However, static provisioning of this information has its
   drawbacks.  It increases provisioning and network maintenance burden
   for the operator.  Moreover, static provisioning does not allow load
   balancing, failover, opportunistic home link assignment etc.  For
   example, the user may be accessing the network from a location that
   may be geographically far away from the preconfigured home link; the
   administrative burden to configure the MN's with the respective
   addresses is large and the ability to react on environmental changes
   is minimal.  In these situations static provisioning may not be
   desirable.

   Dynamic assignment of Mobile IPv6 home registration information is a
   desirable feature for ease of deployment and network maintenance.
   For this purpose, the RADIUS infrastructure, which is used for access
   authentication, can be leveraged to assign some or all of the
   necessary parameters.  The RADIUS server in the Access Service
   Provider (ASP) or in the Mobility Service Provider's (MSP) network
   may return these parameters to the AAA client.  The AAA client might
   either be the NAS, in case of the integrated scenario, or the HA, in
   case of the split scenario.  The terms integrated and split are
   described in the terminology section and were introduced in [6].

2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   General mobility terminology can be found in [7].  The following
   additional terms, as defined in [6], are used in this document:

   Access Service Authorizer (ASA):

      A network operator that authenticates a MN and establishes the
      MN's authorization to receive Internet service.

   Access Service Provider (ASP):

      A network operator that provides direct IP packet forwarding to
      and from the MN.

   Mobility Service Authorizer (MSA):

      A service provider that authorizes Mobile IPv6 service.

   Mobility Service Provider (MSP):

      A service provider that provides Mobile IPv6 service.  In order to
      obtain such service, the MN must be authenticated and authorized
      to obtain the Mobile IPv6 service.

   Split Scenario:

      A scenario where the mobility service and the network access
      service are authorized by different entities.

   Integrated Scenario:

      A scenario where the mobility service and the network access
      service are authorized by the same entity.

3.  Solution Overview

   This document addresses the authentication, authorization and
   accounting functionality required by for the MIPv6 bootstrapping as
   outlined in the MIPv6 bootstrapping problem statement document (see
   [6]).  As such, the AAA functionality for the integrated and the
   split scenario needs to be defined.  This requires the ability to
   offer support for the HA to AAA server and the network access server
   to AAA server communication.

   To highlight the main use cases, we briefly describe the integrated
   and the split scenarios in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2, respectively.

3.1.  Integrated Scenario

   In the integrated scenario MIPv6 bootstrapping is provided as part of
   the network access authentication procedure.  Figure 1 shows the
   participating entity.

      Figure 1: Mobile IPv6 Service Access in the Integrated Scenario

   In the typical Mobile IPv6 access scenario as shown above, the MN
   attaches in a ASP's network.  During this network attachment

   procedure, the NAS/RADIUS client interacts with the MN.  As shown in
   Figure 1, the authentication and authorization happens via a RADIUS
   infrastructure.

   At the time of authorizing the user for IPv6 access, the RADIUS
   server in the MSA detects that the user is authorized for Mobile IPv6
   access.  Based on the MSA's policy, the RADIUS server may allocate
   several parameters to the MN for use during the subsequent Mobile
   IPv6 protocol interaction with the HA.

   Depending on the details of the solution interaction with the DHCPv6
   server may be required, as described in [2].

3.2.  Split Scenario

   In the split scenario, Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping is not provided as
   part of the network access authentication procedure.  The Mobile IPv6
   bootstrapping procedure is executed with the Mobility Service
   Provider when desired by the MN.  Two variations can be considered:

   1.  the MSA and the MSP are the same entity.

   2.  the MSA and the MSP are different entities.

   Since scenario (1) is the more generic scenario we show it in
   Figure 2.

    Figure 2: Mobile IPv6 service access in the split scenario (MSA !=
                                   MSP)

   As shown in Figure 2 the interaction between the RADIUS client and
   the RADIUS server is triggered by the protocol interaction between
   the MN and the HA/RADIUS client using IKEv2 (see [3] and [8]).  The
   HA / RADIUS Client interacts with the RADIUS infrastructure to
   perform authentication, authorization, accounting and parameter
   bootstrapping.  The exchange is triggered by the home agent and an
   interaction with the RADIUS infrastructure is initiated.  When the
   protocol exchange is completed then the HA needs to possess the
   Mobile IPv6 specific parameters (see [6]).

   Additionally, the MN might instruct the RADIUS server (via the home
   agent) to perform a dynamic DNS update.

4.  RADIUS Attribute Overview

4.1.  MIP6-HA Attribute

   The RADIUS server may decide to assign a HA to the MN that is in
   close proximity to the point of attachment (e.g., determined by the
   NAS-ID).  There may be other reasons for dynamically assigning HAs to
   the MN, for example to share the traffic load.  The attribute also
   contains the prefix length so that the MN can easily infer the Home
   Link prefix from the HA address.

4.2.  MIP6-HA-FQDN Attribute

   The RADIUS server may assign an FQDN of the HOA to the MN.  The
   mobile node can perform DNS query with the FQDN to derive the HA
   address.

4.3.  MIP6-HL-Prefix Attribute

   For the same reason as the HA assignment, the RADIUS server may
   assign a Home Link that is in close proximity to the point of
   attachment (NAS-ID).  The MN can perform [5] specific procedures to
   discover other information for Mobile IPv6 registration.

4.4.  MIP6-HOA Attribute

   The RADIUS server may assign a HOA to the MN.  This allows the
   network operator to support mobile devices that are not configured
   with static addresses.  The attribute also contains the prefix length
   so that the MN can easily infer the Home Link prefix from the HA
   address.

4.5.  MIP6-DNS-MO Attribute

   By using this payload the RADIUS client instructs the RADIUS server
   to perform a dynamic DNS update.  When this payload is included in
   the reverse direction, i.e., from the RADIUS server to the RADIUS
   client, it informs about the status of the dynamic DNS update.  When
   the payload is sent from the RADIUS client to the RADIUS server then
   the response MUST include the MIP6-DNS-MO attribute.

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Mobile IPv6 Support           October 2006


5.  RADIUS attributes

   This section defines format and syntax for the attribute that carries
   the Mobile IPv6 parameters that are described in the previous
   section.

   The attributes MAY be present in Access-Accept, Accounting-Request.

5.1.  MIP6-HA Attribute

   This attribute is sent by the RADIUS server to the NAS in an Access-
   Accept packet.  The attribute carries the assigned HA address.

   This attribute MAY be sent by the NAS to the RADIUS server in an
   Access-Request packet as a hint to suggest a dynamic HA that may be
   assigned to the MN.  The RADIUS server MAY use this value or may
   ignore this suggestion.

   If available at the NAS, at least MIP6-HA attribute and/or MIP6-HA-
   FQDN SHOULD appear in accounting packets to indicate the identity of
   the serving HA for this session.

6.  Message Flows

6.1.  Integrated Scenario (MSA=ASA)

   This section is based on [2] and uses the previously defined RADIUS
   attributes.

6.1.1.  HA allocation in the MSP

   RADIUS is used to authenticate the MN, to authorize it for the
   mobility service and to send information about the assigned HA to the
   NAS.

                         HA allocation in the MSP

   In step (1), the MN executes the normal network access authentication
   procedure (e.g., IEEE 802.11i/802.1x, PANA) with the NAS.  The NAS
   acts as an authenticator in "pass-through" mode, i.e., the endpoint
   of the authentication dialogue is the MN's home RADIUS server.  This



Chowdhury, et al.        Expires April 28, 2007                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Mobile IPv6 Support           October 2006


   is the typical scenario in case the messages involved in the
   authentication protocol are transported in EAP.

   As per [10], the NAS encapsulates/decapsulates EAP packets into/from
   RADIUS packets until an Access-Response (either an Access-Accept or
   an Access/Reject packet is received by the NAS).  This concludes the
   network access authentication phase.

   Depending on the RADIUS server configuration, the MIP6-HA attribute
   or the the MIP6-HA-FQDN attribute may be appended to the Access-
   Accept packet.  In the latter case the MN needs to perform a DNS
   query in order to discover the HA address.

   The MIP6-HA or MIP6-HA-FQDN attribute is appended to the Access-
   Accept in case the home RADIUS server knows or has allocated a HA to
   the Access-Request (this is assumed in this scenario).

   In step (2) the MN sends a DHCPv6 Information Request message to
   all_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers.  In the OPTION_ORO, Option Code
   for the Home Network Identifier Option shall be included in that
   message.  The Home Network Identifier Option should have id-type of
   1, the message is a request to discover home network information that
   pertains to the given realm, i.e., the user's home domain (identified
   by the NAI of the MN).  The OPTION_CLIENTID is set by the MN to
   identify itself to the DHCP server.

   In step (3) the DHCP relay agent forwards this request to the DHCP
   server.  The OPTION_MIP6-RELAY-Option is included in this forwarded
   message.  This option carries the RADIUS MIP6-HA Attribute from the
   Access-Accept packet.

   In step (4), the DHCP server identifies the client (by DUID) and
   finds out that it requests HA information in the MSP (by the Home
   Network Identifier Option = 1).  The DHCP server extracts the HA
   address from OPTION_MIP6-RELAY-Option and places it into Home Network
   Information Option in the Reply message.

   In step (5), the Relay Agent forwards the Reply Message to the MN.
   On reception of this message, the HA address or the FQDN of the home
   agent is available at the MN.

6.1.2.  HA allocation in the ASP (visited network)

   This scenario is similar to the one described in Section 6.1.1.  The
   difference is in step (2), where the type-id field in the Home
   Network Identifier Option is set to zero, indicating that a HA is
   requested in the ASP instead of in the MSP.  Thus, the information
   received by the home RADIUS server, via the DHCP relay, in the



Chowdhury, et al.        Expires April 28, 2007                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Mobile IPv6 Support           October 2006


   OPTION_MIP6-RELAY-Option (Information Request) is ignored.  The DHCP
   server allocates a HA from its list of possible HAs and returns it in
   the Reply message (Home Network Information Option).

6.2.  Split Scenario (MSA!=ASA)

6.2.1.  Mobile Service Provider and Mobile Service Authorizer are the
        same entity.

   The assumption in this scenario is that the MN has the domain name of
   the MSP preconfigured.

   In this scenario there is no relationship between the network access
   authentication procedure and the MIPv6 bootstrapping procedure.

   In order to learn the IP address of the HA, the MN either performs a
   DNS lookup of the HA Name or a DNS lookup by service name.  In the
   first case, the MN is preconfigured with the FQDN of the HA, and thus
   sends a DNS request, where QNAME = name of HA, QTYPE='AAAA' (request
   for IPv6 address of HA).  A DNS reply message is returned by the DNS
   server with the HA address.

   The MN then runs IKEv2 [11] with the HA in order to set up IPsec SAs
   (MN-HA).  As part of this,the MN authenticates itself to the RADIUS
   server in the MSA domain, and obtains authorization for mobility
   service (including the Home Address).

   The MN shares credentials with the RADIUS server in the MSA domain.
   The RADIUS communication between the HA and the this RADIUS server is
   also secured by RADIUS-specific mechanisms (e.g., IPsec).  Using EAP
   within IKEv2 [11], the MN is authenticated and authorized for the
   IPv6 mobility service and is also assigned a HOA.

   The setup of SAs and mutual authentication between MN and AAAH using
   RADIUS (and EAP) is similar to the one described for Diameter
   protocol in [12].  The described mechanism ensureas that common
   keying material will be available at the MN and HA after successful
   completion.

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Mobile IPv6 Support           October 2006


   MN and HA start with an IKE_SA_INIT to setup the IKE SA (messages
   defined in the IKEv2 specification [11], negotiating crypto
   algorithms and running DH key exchange).  IKEv2 supports integration
   with EAP.  The MN indicates its desire to use EAP by not including
   the AUTH payload in the third message.  However, it indicates its
   identity (NAI) by using the IDi field.  If the HA supports EAP for
   authentication, as per [10] it forwards the identity to the Remote
   RADIUS server by sending a RADIUS Access-Request packet containing
   the identity in the EAP-Payload AVP and in the RADIUS User-Name
   attribute.  Based on this identity, the Remote RADIUS server chooses
   authentication method and sends the first EAP-Request in the RADIUS
   Access-Challenge packet.  During the EAP authentication phase, the HA
   relays EAP packets between the MN and the Remote RADIUS server.  If
   the authentication succeeds and if the MN is authorized to use Mobile
   IPv6 service, the Remote RADIUS server sends a RADIUS Access-Accept
   packet containing the EAP-Success and the AAA-Key derived from the
   EAP authentication method.  EAP authentication methods that do not
   derive keys are not recommended.  This key is used by both MN and HA
   to generate the AUTH payload.  In subsequent messages, MN and HA
   setup IPsec SAs for Mobile IPv6.

6.2.2.  Mobile Service Provider and Mobile Service Authorizer are
        different entities.

   The HA address discovery is performed as described in Section 6.2.1.


-----------ASP--------->|<-----MSP------------------->|<-----MSA--------

  +----+      IKEv2  +----+ RADIUS (EAP)+------+ RADIUS(EAP)+------+
  | MN |<----------> | HA |<----------->|Local |<---------->|Remote|
  +----+             +----+             |RADIUS|            |RADIUS|

                                        +------+            +------+

                             MSP#MSA Exchange

   The scenario is similar to previously described scenarios with the
   difference of utilizing AAA roaming agreements between the MSP and
   the MSA.

7.  Goals for the HA-AAA Interface

   Here, we follow the classification and labels listed in the MIPv6-
   AAA-Goals document [13].

7.1.  General Goals

   G1.1-G1.4 Security

   These are standard requirements for a AAA protocol - mutual
   authentication, integrity, replay protection, confidentiality.  IPsec
   can be used to achieve the goals.  Goal G1.5 regarding inactive peer
   detection needs further investigations since heartbeat messages do
   not exist (like in the Diameter case, Watch-Dog-Request/Answer).

7.2.  Service Authorization

   G2.1.  The AAA-HA interface should allow the use of Network Access
   Identifier (NAI) to identify the MN.  The User-Name attribute can be
   used for the purpose to carry the NAI.

   G2.2 The HA should be able to query the AAAH server to verify Mobile
   IPv6 service authorization for the MN.  Any node implementing RADIUS
   functionality[4] can possibly initiate a request message.  In
   combination with the ability of the RADIUS protocol to carry EAP
   messages [10] , our solution will enable an HA to query a RADIUS
   server and verify MIPv6 authorization for the MN.

   G2.3 The AAAH server should be able to enforce explicit operational
   limitations and authorization restrictions on the HA (e.g., packet
   filters, QoS parameters).  Work in progress in the area, including
   NAS-Filter-Rule, RADIUS quality of service support, prepaid
   extensions etc. is performed.  The relevant attributes may be reused
   for providing required functionality over the AAAH-HA interface.

   G2.4 - G2.6.  Issues addressing the maintenance of a Mobile IPv6
   session by the AAAH server, e.g., authorization lifetime, extension
   of the authorization lifetime and explicit session termination by the
   AAAH server side.

   The attribute Session-Timeout may be sent in Access-Challenge or
   Access-Accept packet by the RADIUS server, thus limiting the
   authorization session duration.  In order to reauthenticate/
   reauthorize the user, the Termination-Action attribute can be
   included, with value 1, meaning the NAS should send a new RADIUS-
   Request packet.  Additional AVPs for dealing with pre-paid sessions
   (e.g,. volume, resource used--VolumeQuota AVP, ResourceQuota AVP) are
   specified in RADIUS prepaid extension.  Exchanging of application

   specific authorization request/answer messages provides extension of
   the authorization session (e.g., Authorize Only Access-Request sent
   by the HA (NAS) to the RADIUS server).  Initiation of the re-
   authorization by both sides could be supported.  Both sides could
   initiate session termination - the RADIUS server by sending
   Disconnect message [14].

7.3.  Accounting

   G3.1 The AAA-HA interface must support the transfer of accounting
   records needed for service control and charging.  These include (but
   may not be limited to): time of binding cache entry creation and
   deletion, octets sent and received by the MN in bi-directional
   tunneling, etc.

   The requirements for accounting over the AAAH-HA interface does not
   require enhancements to the existing accounting functionality.

7.4.  MN Authentication

   G4.1 The AAA-HA interface MUST support pass-through EAP
   authentication with the HA working as EAP authenticator operating in
   pass-through mode and the AAAH server working as back-end
   authentication server.

   These issues require the functionality of AAAH server working as a
   back-end authentication server and HA working as NAS and EAP
   authenticator in pass-through mode for providing a MN authentication.
   This document suggests this mode of operation in the context of the
   relevant scenarios.

7.5.  Provisioning of Configuration Parameters

   G5.1 The HA should be able to communicate to the AAAH server the HOA
   allocated to the MN (e.g. for allowing the AAAH server to perform DNS
   update on behalf of the MN).

   This document describes needed AVPs for this purpose, see section
   "DNS Update Mobility Option Attribute"

8.  Table of Attributes

   The following tables provides a guide to which attributes may be
   found in RADIUS packet and in what number.



The following defines the meaning of the notation used in the following
tables:

   0     This attribute MUST NOT be present.
   0-1   Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present.


Request  Accept  Reject  Challenge  Type    Attribute

0-1[a]     0-1[a]  0       0        MIP6-HA-TYPE        MIP6-HA Attribute
0-1[a]     0-1[a]  0       0        MIP6-HA-FQDN-TYPE   MIP6-HA-FQDN Attribute
0-1[b]     0-1     0       0        MIP6-HL-PREFIX-TYPE MIP6-HL-Prefix Attribute
0-1[b]     0-1     0       0        MIP6-HOA-TYPE       MIP6-HOA Attribute
0-1        0-1     0       0        MIP6-DNS-MO-TYPE    MIP6-DNS-MO Attribute

Notes:
[a] Either MIP6-HA or MIP6-HA-FQDN MAY appear in a RADIUS packet.

[b] If MIP6-HA or MIP6-HA-FQDN are present in the Access-Request
    then these attributes MUST also be present in the Access-Request.
    If the RADIUS server accepts the NAS suggestion for the HA, then
    the RADIUS server MUST also include the values received for these
    attributes in the Access-Accept.

As used in accounting packets:

   Request  Interim  Stop    Type    Attribute

   0-1        0-1     0-1    MIP6-HA-TYPE        MIP6-HA Attribute
   0-1        0-1     0-1    MIP6-HA-FQDN-TYPE   MIP6-HA-FQDN Attribute
   0          0       0      MIP6-HL-PREFIX-TYPE MIP6-HL-Prefix Attribute
   0-1        0-1     0-1    MIP6-HOA-TYPE       MIP6-HOA Attribute
   0          0       0      MIP6-DNS-MO-TYPE    MIP6-DNS-MO Attribute

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Mobile IPv6 Support           October 2006


9.  Diameter Considerations

   When used in Diameter, the attributes defined in this specification
   can be used as Diameter AVPs from the Code space 1-255 (RADIUS
   attribute compatibility space).  No additional Diameter Code values
   are therefore allocated.  The data types and flag rules for the
   attributes are as follows:



                                     +---------------------+
                                     |    AVP Flag rules   |
                                     |----+-----+----+-----|----+
                                     |    |     |SHLD| MUST|    |
      Attribute Name      Value Type |MUST| MAY | NOT|  NOT|Encr|
      -------------------------------|----+-----+----+-----|----|
      MIP6-HA             Address    | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
      MIP6-HA-FQDN        UTF8String | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
      MIP6-HL-Prefix      OctetString| M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
      MIP6-HOA            Address    | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
      MIP6-DNS-MO         OctetString| M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
      -------------------------------|----+-----+----+-----|----|

   Other than MIP6-HA and HOA-IPv6, the attributes in this specification
   have no special translation requirements for Diameter to RADIUS or
   RADIUS to Diameter gateways; they are copied as is, except for
   changes relating to headers, alignment, and padding.  See also [15]
   Section 4.1 and [16] Section 9.  MIP6-HA and HOA-IPv6 must be
   translated between their RADIUS representation of String to a
   Diameter Address format which requires that the AddressType field be
   set to 2 for IP6 (IP version 6)

   What this specification says about the applicability of the
   attributes for RADIUS Access-Request packets applies in Diameter to
   AA-Request [16] or Diameter-EAP-Request [17].  What is said about
   Access-Challenge applies in Diameter to AA-Answer [16] or Diameter-
   EAP-Answer [17] with Result-Code AVP set to
   DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH.

   What is said about Access-Accept applies in Diameter to AA-Answer or
   Diameter-EAP-Answer messages that indicate success.  Similarly, what
   is said about RADIUS Access-Reject packets applies in Diameter to AA-
   Answer or Diameter-EAP-Answer messages that indicate failure.

   What is said about Accounting-Request applies to Diameter Accounting-
   Request [16] as well.

10.  Security Considerations

   Assignment of these values to a user should be based on successful
   authentication of the user at the NAS and/or at the HA.  The RADIUS
   server should only assign these values to a user who is authorized
   for Mobile IPv6 service (this check could be performed with the
   user's subscription profile in the Home Network).

   The NAS and the HA to the RADIUS server transactions must be
   adequately secured.  Otherwise there is a possibility that the user
   may receive fraudulent values from a rogue RADIUS server potentially
   hijacking the user's Mobile IPv6 session.

   These new attributes do not introduce additional security
   considerations besides the ones identified in [4].
