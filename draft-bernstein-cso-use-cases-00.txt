Abstract

   This draft describes traffic use-cases of cross-stratum optimization.
   Examples of current application traffic that can require individual
   or aggregate bandwidth significant enough to consider joint
   application and network stratum cooperation/optimization are given
   and basic optimization problems are outlined. For each of these
   generic use cases we also consider enhanced availability and or
   recovery scenarios and discuss the control interfaces useful to
   promote cross stratum optimization.

1. Introduction

   Cloud Computing, network applications, software as a service (SaaS),
   Platform as a service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
   are just a few of the terms used to describe situations where
   multiple computation entities interact with one another across a
   network.   When the communication resources consumed by these
   interacting entities is significant compared with link or network
   capacity then opportunities may exist for more efficient utilization

   of available computation and network resources if both computation
   and network stratums cooperate in some way.

   In this paper we define two general classes of use-cases: end-user
   aggregation, and data center (DC) to data center (DC-to-DC)
   communications. We provide example application flows with bandwidth
   estimates to show that these flows can utilize significant bandwidth
   when compared to current capacities of individual wavelengths in a
   Wave Division Multiplexing (WDM) transport system.

          1.1. Computing Clouds, Data Centers, and End Systems

   While the definition of cloud computing or compute clouds is somewhat
   nebulous (or "foggy" if you will) [1], the physical instantiation of
   compute resources with network connectivity is very real and bounded
   by physical and logical constraints. For the purposes of this paper
   we will call any network connected compute resources a data center if
   its network connectivity is significant compared either to the
   bandwidth of an individual WDM wavelength or with respect to the
   network links in which it is located. Hence we include in our
   definition very large data centers that feature multiple fiber access
   and consume more than 10MW of power [2], moderate to large content
   distribution network (CDN) installations located in or near major
   internet exchange points [3], medium sized business centers, etc...

   We will refer to those computational entities that don't meet our
   bandwidth criteria for a data center as an "end system".

2. End System Aggregate Networking

   In this section we consider the fundamental use case of end systems
   communicating with data centers as shown in Figure 1. In this figure
   the "clients" are end systems with relatively small access bandwidth
   compared to a WDM wavelength, e.g., under 100Mbps. We show these
   clients roughly partitioned into three network related regions ("A",
   "B", and "C"). Given a particular network application, in a static
   network application situation, each client in a region would be
   associated with a particular data center.

          2.1. Aggregated Bandwidth Scaling

    One of the simplest examples where the aggregation of end system
   bandwidth can quickly become significant to the "network" is for
   video on demand (VoD) streaming services. Unlike a live streaming
   service where IP or lower layer multicast techniques can be generally
   applied, in VoD the transmissions are unique between the data center
   and clients. For regular quality VoD we'll use an estimate of 1.5Mbps
   per stream (assuming H.264 coding), for HD VoD we'll use an estimate
   of 10Mbps per stream. To fill up a 10Gbps capacity optical wavelength
   requires either 6,666 or 1,000 clients for regular or high definition
   respectively.  Note that special multicasting techniques such as
   those discussed in [4] and peer assistance techniques such as
   provided in some commercial systems [5] can reduce the overall
   network bandwidth requirements.

    With current high speed internet deployment such numbers of clients
   are easily achieved; in addition demand for VoD services can vary
   significantly over time, e.g., new video releases, inclement weather
   (increases number of viewers), etc...

          2.2. Cross Stratum Optimization Example

    In an ideal world both data centers and networks would have
   unlimited capacity, however in actuality both can have constraints
   and possibly varying marginal costs that vary with load or time of
   day.  For example suppose that in Figure 1 that Data Center 3 has
   been primarily serving VoD to region "C" but that it has, at a
   particular period in time, run out of computation capacity to serve
   all the client requests coming from region "C". At this point we have
   a fundamental cross stratum optimization (CSO) problem. We want to
   see if we can accommodate additional client request from region "C"
   by using a different data center than the fully utilized data center
   #3. To answer this questions we need to know (a) available capacity
   on other data centers to meet a request, (b) the marginal
   (incremental) cost of servicing the request on a particular data
   center with spare capacity, (c) the ability of the network to provide
   bandwidth between region "C" to a data center, and (d) the
   incremental cost of bandwidth from region "C" to a data center.

   In Figure 2 we show a possible result of solving the previously
   mentioned CSO problem. Here we show the additional client requests
   from region "C" being serviced by data center #2 across the network.
   Figure 2 also illustrates the possibility of setting up "express"
   routes across the network at the MPLS level or below. Such
   techniques, known as "optical grooming" or "optical bypass" [6], [7]
   at the optical layer, can result in significant equipment and power
   savings for the network by "bypassing" higher level routers and
   switches.

          2.3. Data Center and Network Faults and Recovery

    Data center failures, whether partial or complete, can have a major
   impact on revenues in the VoD example previously described. If there
   is excess capacity in other data centers within the network
   associated with the same application then clients could be redirected
   to those other centers if the network has the capacity.  Moreover,
   MPLS and GMPLS controlled networks have the ability to reroute
   traffic very quickly while preserving QoS. As with general network
   recovery techniques [8] various combinations of pre-planning and "on
   the fly" approaches can be used to tradeoff between recovery time and
   excess network capacity needed for recovery.

    In the case of network failures there is the potential for clients
   to be redirected to other data centers to avoid failed or over
   utilized links.

          2.4. Cross Stratum Control Interfaces

    Two types of load balancing techniques are currently utilized in
   cloud computing. The first is load balancing within a data center and
   is sometimes referred to as local load balancing. Here one is
   concerned with distributing requests to appropriate machines (or
   virtual machines) in a pool based on the current machine utilization.
   The second type of load balancing is known as global load balancing
   and is used to assign clients to a particular data center out of a
   choice of more than one within the network and is our concern here.
   A number of commercial vendors offer both local and global load
   balancing products (F5, Brocade, Coyote Point Systems).  Currently
   global load balancing systems have very little knowledge of the
   underlying network. To make better assignments of clients to data
   centers many of these systems use geographic information based on IP
   addresses [9]. Hence we see that current systems are attempting to
   perform cross stratum optimization albeit with very coarse network
   information. A more elaborate interface for CSO in the client
   aggregation case would be:

Internet-Draft   Cross Stratum Optimization Use-cases         June 2011


       1. A Network Query Interface - Where the global load balancer can
          inquire as to the bandwidth availability between "client
          regions" and data centers.

       2. A Network Resource Reservation Interface - Where the global
          load balancer can make explicit requests for bandwidth between
          client regions and data centers.

       3. A Fault Recovery Interface - For the global load balancer to
          make requests for expedited bulk rerouting of client traffic
          from one data center to another.

    The network query interface can be considered a superset of the
   functionality proposed from the ALTO (application layer traffic
   optimization) servers being standardized in [10]. Note that in the
   network query and reservation interfaces it would be worthwhile to
   consider both current resources and resources at a future time, i.e.,
   scheduled resources. Although scheduled reservations are not
   supported directly by technologies such as MPLS and GMPLS they can be
   considered in network planning and provisioning systems. For example,
   a VoD provider knows ahead of time when the latest "blockbuster" film
   will be available via its service and can make estimates based on
   historical data on the bandwidth that it will need to deal with the
   subsequent demand.



3. Data Center to Data Center Networking

    There are a number of motivations for data center to data center
   communications: on demand capacity expansion ("cloud bursting") [11],
   cooperative exchanges between business partners, offsite data backup,
   "rent before building"[12], etc... In Figure 3 we show an example
   where a number of businesses each with an "internal data center"
   contracts with a large external data center for additional
   computational (which may include storage) capacity. The data centers
   may connect to each other via IP transit type services or more
   typically via some type of Ethernet virtual private line or LAN
   service.

          3.1. Cross Stratum Optimization Examples

    In the DC-to-DC example of Figure 3 we can have computational
   constraints/limits at both local and remote data centers; fixed and
   marginal computational costs at local and remote data centers; and
   network bandwidth costs and constraints between data centers. Note
   that computing costs could vary by the time of day along with the
   cost of power and demand. Some cloud providers such as Amazon [13]
   have quite sophisticated compute pricing models including: reserved,
   on demand, and spot (auction) variants.

    In addition, to possibly dynamically changing pricing, traffic
   loads between data centers can be quite dynamic. In addition, data
   movement between data centers is another source of large network
   usage variation. Such peaks can be due to scheduled daily or weekly
   offsite data backup, bulk VM migration to a new data center, periodic
   virtual machine migration [14], etc...

          3.2. Network and Data Center Faults and Reliability

    For networked applications that require high levels of
   reliability/availability the network diagram of Figure 4 could be
   enhanced with redundant business locations and external data centers
   as shown in Figure 4. For example cell phone subscriber databases and
   financial transactions generally require what is called geographic
   database replication [15] and results in extra communication between
   sites supporting high availability. For example if business #1 in
   Figure 4 required a highly available database related service then
   there would be an additional communication flows from the data center
   "1a" to data center "1b".  Furthermore, if business #1 has outsourced
   some of its computation and storage needs to independent data center
   X then for resilience it may want/need to replicate (hot-hot
   redundancy) this information at independent data center Y.

Internet-Draft   Cross Stratum Optimization Use-cases         June 2011


          3.3. Cross Stratum Control Interfaces

    Similar to the end system aggregation case we can decompose cross
   stratum interfaces into three general types: (a) network query, (b)
   network reservation, and (c) recovery. However for DC-to-DC
   interfaces we are interested in network resources between data
   centers rather than between "client regions" and data centers.

    For network resource queries we may be concerned with (a) current
   bandwidth availability, (b) bandwidth availability at a future time,
   or (c) bandwidth for a bulk data transfer of a given amount that must
   take place within a given time window. A network reservation
   interface with both current and advanced reservation capability would
   complement the query interface.

   A simple recovery interface for data center based faults could be
   based on unused backup paths between data centers that are reserved
   but not activated unless a request is received from the application
   stratum that recovery action is requested.

4. Conclusion

   In this draft we have discussed two generic use cases that motivate
   the usefulness of cross stratum optimization. In our first use case
   network resource usage became significant due to the aggregation of
   many individually unique client demands. While in the second use case
   where data centers were communicating with each other bandwidth usage
   was already significant enough to warrant the use of private line/LAN
   type of network services.

   Both use cases result in optimization problems that trade off
   computational versus network costs and constraints. Both featured
   scenarios where advanced reservation, on demand, and recovery type
   service interfaces could prove beneficial. Many concepts from recent
   standardization work at the IETF [10] such as location identifiers,
   and endpoint properties could be reused in defining such interfaces.
