Abstract 

   This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation 
   Protocol (SIP) Reason Header [1] to include in a BYE Method Request 
   [2] as a result of a session preemption event either at a user 
   agent (UA), or somewhere in the network using RSVP [3].  This 
   document does not attempt to address routers failing in the packet 
   path; but a deliberate event of tearing down a flow between UAs.

1.0  Introduction

   With the introduction of the Resource-Priority (R-P) header [4], 
   there became the possibility of sessions being torn down for 
   (scarce) resource reasons; meaning there weren't enough for a 
   particular session to continue.  Certain domains will implement this
   mechanism where resources may become constrained either at the user 
   agent (UA), or for congested router interfaces where more important 
   sessions are to be completed at the expense of less important 
   sessions.  Which sessions are more or less important than others 
   will not be discussed here.  What will be proposed here is extending
   SIP to synchronize SIP elements as to why a preemption event 
   occurred and which type of event occurred, as viewed by the element 
   that performed the preemption of a session. 

   The Reason Header is an application layer feedback mechanism to 
   synchronize SIP elements of events; the particular event explained 
   here deals with preemption.  No other means exists today to give 
   this feedback as to why a session was torn down for preemption 
   grounds.

   In the event that a session is terminated for a specific reason that
   can (or should) be shared with SIP Servers and UAs, the Reason 
   Header [1] was created to be included in the BYE Request.  This was 
   not the only reason for this new Header; [1] also discusses the 
   CANCEL Method Request.

Internet Draft         Preemption in Reason Header        Oct 8th, 2003


   This document will define two use-cases in which new preemption 
   Reason values are necessary:


      Access Preemption Event - this is when a UA receives a new SIP 
             session request message with a valid R-P value that is 
             higher than the one associated with the currently active 
             session at that UA.  The UA must discontinue the existing 
             session in order to accept the new one (based on local 
             policy of some domains)

      Network Preemption Event - this is when a network element - such 
             as a router - reaches capacity on a particular interface 
             and has the ability to statefully choose which sessions 
             will remain active when a new session/reservation is 
             signaled for under the parameters of RSVP in [3] that 
             would otherwise overload that interface (perhaps adversely
             affecting all sessions).  In this case, the router must 
             terminate one or more reservations of lower priority in 
             order to allow this higher priority reservation access to 
             the requested amount of bandwidth (based on local policy 
             of some domains)

   This document will cover the semantics for these two cases, and 
   request IANA registration two new Reason Header value for 
   preemption conditions.

2.0 Access Preemption Events 

   As mentioned previously, Access Preemption Events (APE) occur at 
   the user agent.  It doesn't matter which UA in a unicast or 
   multicast session this happens to (the UAC or UAS of a session).  If
   local policy dictates in a particular domain rules regarding the 
   functionality of a UA, there must be a means by which that UA (not 
   the user) informs the other UA(s) why a session was just torn down 
   prematurely.  The appropriate mechanism is to utilize the BYE 
   Method.  The user of the other far side UA will not understand why 
   that session "just went away" without there being a means of 
   informing the UA what occurred (if this event was purposeful), and 
   why it occurred.  Through this type of indication to the preempted 
   UA, it can indicate to the user of that device appropriately.

   The following diagram (Figure 1) illustrates the scenario here.  UA1
   invites UA2 to a session with the Resource Priority level of 3 
   (levels 1 and 2 are higher is this domain).

   After the session between UA1 and UA2 is established, UA3 invites 
   UA2 to a new session with an R-P of 2 (a higher priority than the 
   current session between UA1 and UA2).  Local policy within this 
   domain dictates that UA2 MUST preempt all existing calls of lower 
   priority in order to accept a higher priority call.

   What Reason value could be inserted above to mean "preemption"?  
   There are several choices: 410 "Gone", 480 "Temporarily 
   Unavailable", 486 "Busy Here", and 503 "Service Unavailable".  The 
   use of any here is questionable because the session is already 
   established.  It is further complicated if there needs to be a 
   difference in the Reason value for an Access versus a Network 
   Preemption Event (which is a requirement here).

Internet Draft         Preemption in Reason Header        Oct 8th, 2003

2.1  Effects of Preemption at the User Agent

   If 2 UAs are in a session, and one UA must preempt that session to 
   accept another session, a BYE Method message is the appropriate 
   mechanism to perform this task.  However, taking this a step 
   further, if a UA is the common point of a 3-way (or more) adhoc 
   conference participants and must preempt all sessions in that 
   conference due to a higher priority session request received (that 
   this UA must accept), then a BYE message MUST be sent to all UAs in 
   that adhoc conference.


2.2  Reason Header Requirements for Access Preemption Events

   The following is a list of requirements for adding an appropriate 
   Reason value for an Access Preemption Event (APE) as described above
   and shown in Figure 1:

      APE_REQ#1 - create a means by which one UA can inform another UA 
                  (within the same active session) that the active 
                  session between the two devices is being preempted at
                  one UA for a higher priority session request from 
                  another UA

      APE_REQ#2 - create a means by which all relevant SIP elements can
                  be informed of this Access Preemption Event to a 
                  specific session

   For example: perhaps SIP Servers that have incorporated a Record-
   Route header into that session set-up

      APE_REQ#3 - create a means of informing all participants in a 
                  adhoc conference that the primary UA (the mixer) has 
                  preempted the conference by accepting a higher 
                  priority session request

      APE_REQ#4 - create a separate indication for the access 
                  preemption event than any used for a Network 
                  Preemption Event (described in the next section) in 
                  the session BYE message


3.0 Network Preemption Events

   Network Preemption Events (NPE) are those instances in which a 
   intermediate router between SIP elements preempts one or more 
   session(s) at one of its interfaces to place a higher priority 
   session through that interface. Within RSVP, there exists a means to
   execute this functionality in [6]: ResvErr messages - which travel 
   downstream towards appropriate receivers.  The ResvErr message has 
   


Polk                                                           [Page 5]

Internet Draft         Preemption in Reason Header        Oct 8th, 2003

   the ability to carry within it a code why a reservation is being 
   torn down.  The ResvErr does not travel upstream to the other UA.  
   This document here proposes that a SIP message be generated to 
   synchronize all relevant SIP elements to this preemption event.  
   Creating another Reason value describing that a network element 
   preempted the session is necessary. 


   The following 2 diagrams (Figure 2 and 3) illustrate the network 
   preemption scenario:  

          UA1                                  UA2           
             \                                /              
              \                              /               
               +--------+          +--------+                
               |        |          |        |                
               | RTR1   |          |  RTR2  |                
               |       Int7-------Int5      |                
               |        |          |        |                
               +--------+          +--------+                
              /                              \               
             /                                \              
          UA3                                  UA4           
                                                             
             Figure 2. Network Diagram Scenario A            
                

   UA1 invites UA2 to a session with the Resource Priority level of 3 
   (levels 1 and 2 are higher is this domain) and is accepted.  The 
   link between Router 1 and Router 2 became saturated with this 
   session between UA1 and UA2 (in this example).  After the session 
   between UA1 and UA2 is established, UA3 invites UA4 to a new session
   with an Resource Priority level of 2 (a higher priority than the 
   current session between UA1 and UA2).  When this second (higher 
   priority session) is signaled, the Path message goes from UA3 to 
   UA4, resulting in the Resv message going from UA4 back to UA3.  
   Because this link between the two routers is congested, Router 2 
   will (in this example) preempt lower priority BW to ensure this 
   higher priority session is completed.  The congestion point is in 
   Router 2, interface 5 (in figure 2).  A ResvErr message is sent to 
   UA1.  The result is that UA1 will know that there has been a 
   preemption event in a router (because the ResvErr message has a 
   error code within it stating "preemption"), UA2 will not know 
   anything other than its reservation went away.  If there is any SIP 
   Proxies in between the 2 UAs (perhaps that inserted a Record-Route 
   Header), each will need to be informed also as to why this 
   reservation was torn down. 

   In Figure 3 is the call flow with Router 2 from Figure 2 included at
   the RSVP layer sending the Resv messages.  A complete call flow 
   including all UAs and Routers is not here for diagram complexity

   use of any here is questionable because the session is already 
   established.  It is further complicated if there needs to be a 
   difference in the Reason value for an Access versus a Network 
   Preemption Event. 

   To generically state that all preemptions are equal is possible, but
   will not provide adequate information.  Therefore, another Reason 
   Header value is necessary to differentiate the APE from the NPE.

Internet Draft         Preemption in Reason Header        Oct 8th, 2003

3.1  Reason Header Requirements for Network Preemption Events

   The following are the requirements for the appropriate SIP signaling
   in reaction to a Network Preemption Event:

      NPE_REQ#1 - create a means of informing the far end UA that a 
                  Network Preemption Event has occurred in an 
                  intermediate router

      NPE_REQ#2 - create a means by which all relevant SIP elements can
                  be informed of a Network Preemption Event to a 
                  specific session

   For example: perhaps SIP Servers that have incorporated a Record-
   Route header into that session set-up

      NPE_REQ#3 - create a means of informing all participants in a 
                  adhoc conference that the primary UA (the mixer) has 
                  been preempted by a Network Preemption Event

      NPE_REQ#4 - create a separate description of the Network 
                  Preemption Event relative to an Access Preemption 
                  Event in SIP


4.0 Proposed Reason Header Values and Descriptions

   RFC 3326 [1] defines the format of the header as follows:

   Reason           = "Reason" HCOLON reason-value *(COMMA reason-value)
   reason-value     = protocol *(SEMI reason-params)
   protocol         = "SIP" / "Q.850" / token
   reason-params    = protocol-cause / reason-text
                       / reason-extension
   protocol-cause   = "cause" EQUAL cause
   cause            = 1*DIGIT
   reason-text      = "text" EQUAL quoted-string
   reason-extension = generic-param

   The following are currently the only defined values in the protocol 
   field in [1]:

      SIP: The cause parameter contains a SIP status code.

      Q.850: The cause parameter contains an ITU-T Q.850 cause value
           in decimal representation.

Internet Draft         Preemption in Reason Header        Oct 8th, 2003

4.1 Access Preemption Event Reason Value

   The following Reason Header value is proposed for cases of Access 
   Preemption Events:

   Reason           = "Reason" HCOLON reason-value *(COMMA reason-value)
   reason-value     = protocol *(SEMI reason-params)
   protocol         = "SIP" / "Q.850" / token
   token            = preempted_UA 

   with the following "token" value being proposed in this document for 
   addition to the IANA Registry under possible Reason Values:

      preempted_UA : a user agent in a session has preempted a session 
                and is informing the far end user agent, or user agents
                (if part of a conference), and SIP Proxies (if 
                stateful of the session's transactions)

   This token was chosen because there is no SIP (or other Standards 
   Body recognized) cause code that replicates the meaning of a 
   existing session intentionally preempted at the user agent.

   An example usage of this header value would be:


      Reason: preempted_UA ;text="user agent preemption"


   This effort is open to the idea of registering a 400 or 500 level 
   error code just for this, but it seems excessive at this time. 
   A 37X level warning code can also be created - but it is not 
   apparent that this is necessary.  Comments regarding this document 
   will determine if creating new a new code number is a better course 
   of action than the above token name.

4.1.1 Access Preemption Event Call Flow

   The following diagram (Figure 4) replicates the call flow from 
   Figure 1 - but with an appropriate Reason value indication that was 
   proposed in section 4.1 above:

     Figure 4. Access Preemption with Reason : Preempted_UA  

   UA1 invites UA2 to a session with the Resource Priority level of 3 
   (levels 1 and 2 are higher is this domain).  After the session 
   between UA1 and UA2 is established, UA3 invites UA2 to a new session
   with an R-P of 2 (a higher priority than the current session to 
   UA1).  Local policy within this domain dictates that UA2 MUST 
   preempt all existing calls of lower priority in order to accept a 
   higher priority call. 

   UA2 sends a BYE Request message with a Reason header with a value: 
   preempted_UA.  This will inform the far end UA (UA1), and all 
   relevant SIP elements (for example: SIP Proxies).  The token name 
   "preempted_UA" is unique to what is proposed in the Network 
   Preemption Event.

Internet Draft         Preemption in Reason Header        Oct 8th, 2003

4.2 Network Preemption Events Reason Value

   The following Reason Header value is proposed for cases of Network 
   Preemption Events:

   Reason           = "Reason" HCOLON reason-value *(COMMA reason-value)
   reason-value     = protocol *(SEMI reason-params)
   protocol         = "SIP" / "Q.850" / token
   token            = preempted_network

   with the following "token" value being proposed in this documents 
   for addition to the IANA Registry under possible Reason Values:

      preempted_network : a router has preempted a reservation flow and
                generated a ResvErr (downstream).  The (downstream) UA 
                receiving the ResvErr message generates a BYE request 
                towards the far side UA with a Reason header with this 
                value indicating that somewhere in the network a layer 
                3/4 device (router) has preempted this session

   This token was chosen because there is no SIP (or other Standards 
   Body recognized) cause code that replicates the meaning of a 
   existing session as a RSVP flow intentionally preempted by an 
   intermediate router within the network between UAs.

   An example usage of this header value would be:


     Reason: preempted_network ;text="session preempted within network"


   This effort is open to the idea of registering a 400 or 500 level 
   error code just for this, but it seems excessive at this time. 
   A 37X level warning code can also be created - but it is not 
   apparent that this is necessary.  Comments regarding this document 
   will determine if creating new a new code number is a better course 
   of action than the above token name.

       Figure 5. Network Preemption with obscure Reason      

   Above is the call flow with Router 2 from Figure 2 included at the 
   RSVP layer sending the Resv messages.  A complete call flow 
   including all UAs and Routers is not here for diagram complexity 
   reasons.  The signaling between UA3 and UA4 is also not included.

   Upon receipt of the ResvErr message with the preemption error code, 
   UA1 can now appropriately inform UA2 why this event occurred.  This 
   BYE message will also inform all relevant SIP elements, 
   synchronizing them.  The token name is unique to that proposed in 
   section 4.1 for Access Preemption Events.

Internet Draft         Preemption in Reason Header        Oct 8th, 2003

5.0 Security Considerations

   Eavesdropping on this header field should not prevent proper 
   operation of the SIP protocol, although some domains utilizing this 
   mechanism for notifying and synchronizing SIP elements will likely 
   want the integrity to be assured.  


6.0 IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new SIP header field values for the "Reason 
   Header" from RFC 3326 [1].  Two new token values are to be IANA 
   registered based on this document.


    Token value            Defined in section of this document:
    -----------            -----------------------------------

    preempted_UA                section 4.1

    preempted_network           section 4.2


   There is no protocol name or cause value associated with these token
   Values.
