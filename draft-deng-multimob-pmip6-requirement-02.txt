Internet-Draft      Multicast Requirements for PMIPv6          July 2009


1.  Introduction

   Many of the current mobile network architectures as well as link
   layer technologies provide an independent multicast/broadcast support
   for dedicated group communication services, e.g., based on specific
   wireless channels.  Typically, applications like Internet IPTV, that
   require voluminous content streams to be distributed to potentially
   large numbers of receivers, may take benefit of this transport mode.
   At the same time, with the development of mobile Internet protocols,
   the need emerged for a seamlessly available multicast solution that
   makes efficient use of the multipoint transmission technologies
   deployed by operators [MMCASTv6-PS].

   As an example, mobile IPTV channels, which combine Audio/Video
   programs with interactive data for supplementary information (using
   bi-directional wireless broadband links), and with potential large
   audience, may take particular advantage of any multicast/ broadcast
   mobile support at access networks for downlink distribution of A/V
   streams.

   Among IP mobility management protocols, Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)
   [RFC5213] has been designed to bring IP mobility making the mobile
   nodes unaware of network layer changes.  Functional entities in the
   PMIPv6 infrastructure are the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) and the
   Mobile Access Gateway (MAG).  The local mobility anchor is
   responsible for maintaining the mobile node's reachability state and
   is the topological anchor point for the mobile node's home network
   prefix(es).  The mobile access gateway performs mobility management
   operations on behalf of the mobile node.  Basically, the mobile
   access gateway is responsible for detecting the mobile node's
   movements, to and from the access link, and for initiating binding
   registrations (i.e. location updates) to the mobile node's local
   mobility anchor.

   The current PMIPv6 specification lacks dedicated support of group
   communication.  To facilitate design of a multicast support in future
   solutions, this document gathers requirements for multicast listener
   support.  In correspondance to PMIPv6, multicast mobility management
   requirements should not request any active participation of the
   mobile multicast recipient.

2.  Scenarios of Multicast Support for PMIPv6

   According to [RFC5213], two basic routing scenarios exist in PMIPv6:
   the tunneling mode and local routing.  The tunneling mode as
   displayed in Figure 1 uses IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation [RFC2473]
   (IPv6-in-IPv4 in [PMIPv6v4]) to transfer data between LMA and MAG.
   Thus two entities are facing an avalanche problem (cf.
   [MMCASTv6-PS]), the LMA in feeding multicast streams to the MAGs, and
   the MAG in distributing multicast on air to the mobile nodes.

   PMIP multicast support must clearly address above issues but should
   also bring good user experience of multicast mobility.  In addition,
   it is expected that the solution shall inherit from the basics of
   PMIP scenarios; in particular mobility management should not require
   to add specific functions to the IPv6 node.  In these perspectives,
   following sections summarize protocol and architecture requirements
   for multicast support in Proxy Mobile IPv6.

3.  Requirements for multicast support in PMIPv6

   This section summarizes the requirements for mobile multicast
   protocol extensions of PMIPv6.

3.1.  Basic functional requirements

   R1 - PMIPv6 multicast mobility management MUST transparently support
   the reception of Any Source Multicast (ASM) or Source Specific
   Multicast (SSM) channels.

   R2 - The mobile node is responsible for initially subscribing to the
   multicast group(s).

   R3 - The mobile node MAY remain agnostic of the multicast mobility
   management when roaming.  In particular, the node MUST not be
   required to re-subscribe to multicast group(s) after handoff.

   R4 - Multicast packet distribution within a PMIPv6 domain MUST not
   cause MTU-size conflicts on the network layer.  In particular, path
   MTU discovery MUST NOT be required for multicast transmission.

   R5 - PMIPv6 multicast mobility management MUST comply with multicast
   scoping rules and restrictions.

   R6 - PMIPv6 multicast mobility management MUST equally cover IPv6/
   IPv4 only and dual stack nodes.

   R7 - A multicast solution MUST be compatible with the existing PMIPv6
   network architecture and protocol structure such as multihoming and
   vertical handover.

3.2.  Multicast performance requirements

   R8 - PMIPv6 transmission SHOULD realize native multicast forwarding,
   and where applicable conserve network resources and utilize link
   layer multipoint distribution to avoid data redundancy.

   R9 - The solution MUST minimize multicast forwarding delays to
   provide seamless and fast handovers for real-time services.  After a
   handoff, multicast data SHOULD continue to reach the mobile listener
   at a latency similar to unicast communication.

   R10 - The PMIPv6 multicast mobility management SHOULD avoid to cause
   packet loss in addition to unicast handoff.

   R11 - Multicast mobility SHOULD minimize transport costs on the
   forwarding link, as well as any additional overhead on the multicast

   delivery path.

   R12 - Routing convergence MUST be ensured, even when the MN moves
   rapidly and performs handovers at a high frequency.

   R13 - The protocol MUST be robust against irregular moves of the MN
   (e.g. ping-pong mobility) and MUST not compromise (unicast) network
   performance.

4.  Architecture requirements

   In addition to protocol requirements as listed in the preceeding
   section, mobile multicast support for listeners MAY lead to
   requirement on the PMIPv6 architectural entities.  These potential
   issues are sketched in the following sub-sections:

4.1.  LMA Requirements for multicast support in PMIPv6

   Multicast Bandwidth Control: LMA should be able to control the total
   bandwidth of a user port that can be used for multicast service,
   thereby monitoring the fraction of the total bandwidth consumed by
   multicast.  This requirement may lead to support a range of different
   service classes with various QoS requirements.

   Multicast AAA control: AAA functions MAY resident at the LMA, in
   particular admission control and accounting, MAY be preserved and
   applicable under multicast services.

   Multicast forwarding: LMA could forward the multicast through unicast
   IPv6 header between MN-HoA and LMA.

4.2.  MAG Requirements for multicast support in PMIPv6

   It is foreseeable that the MAG has to act as a multicast designated
   router.  Hence support of MLDv2 [RFC3810] or LW-MLDv2 is MAY be
   required at the MAG.

   Further MAG-specific requirements can be identified:

   Access Control: it is required that Access Control based on available
   resources is supported at the MAG.

Internet-Draft      Multicast Requirements for PMIPv6          July 2009


5.  Security Considerations

   Multicast security is one of the most crucial issues in mobile
   multicast service such that it is required to provide security
   capabilities to protect mobile multicast network from any malicious
   attempts caused by multicast security holes such as denial of service
   attacks.

   - The multicast service in PMIPv6 should not degrade the security
   protection of the basic PMIPv6 AAA mechanism.

   - Multicast system architecture is required to provide an admission
   control mechanism to regulate any multicast events.

   - Multicast system architecture is required to be independent of
   adjacent domains such that it shall not affect the adjacent multicast
   domain without permission.

   - Multicast system architecture is required to provide a mechanism to
   check integrity of multicast sources prior to service delivery such
   that it prevents unauthorized source to distribute multicast content.
