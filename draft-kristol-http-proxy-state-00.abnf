NAME=VALUE
     Required.  The name of the state information (``Pcookie'') is NAME,
     and its value is VALUE.

     The VALUE is opaque to the client and may be anything the proxy
     server chooses to send, possibly in a server-selected printable
     ASCII encoding.  ``Opaque'' implies that the content is of interest
     and relevance only to the proxy server.  The content may, in fact,
     be readable by anyone that examines the Set-Pcookie header.

CommentURL="http_URL"
     Optional.  Because Pcookies could be used to derive or store
     private information about a user, the CommentURL attribute allows a
     proxy server to document how it intends to use the Pcookie.  The
     user can inspect the information identified by the URL to decide
     whether to initiate or continue a session with this Pcookie.

Max-Age=value
     Optional.  The value of the Max-Age attribute defines the lifetime
     of the Pcookie, in seconds.  The delta-seconds value is a decimal
     non-negative integer.  After delta-seconds seconds elapse, the
     client should discard the Pcookie.  A value of zero means the
     Pcookie should be discarded immediately.

Persist=value
     Optional.  The value of the Persist attribute determines whether
     the client should remember the value of the Pcookie across client
     invocations.  The value must be either yes or no.

Version=value
     Required.  The value of the Version attribute, a decimal integer,
     identifies the version of the state management specification to
     which the Pcookie conforms.  For this specification, Version=0
     applies.
