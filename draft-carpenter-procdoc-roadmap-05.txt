Internet-Draft        IETF Process: Informal Guide           August 2006


1.  Introduction

   BCP 9 [RFC2026] has been the basis for the IETF standards process for
   many years.  However, many other process documents exist, some of
   which are partial updates to BCP 9.  This situation is confusing and
   would ideally be resolved by a clear set of interlocking documents.
   The present document suggests a structured way of looking at the
   existing documents.

   It is difficult to linearise a complicated and interlocked process.
   This document presents a guide in one particular order, but that is
   not intended to imply priority or importance, and it cannot capture
   all interactions between components.

   Formally, IETF processes are described in Best Current Practices
   (BCPs) published as RFCs.  Most of the cited RFCs are BCPs.  RFC
   numbers have been used rather than BCP numbers, for convenient
   lookup.  To avoid any accidental ambiguity, this guide does not
   attempt to paraphrase or summarize their contents; the reader should
   consult the original RFCs.


2.  The guide

2.1.  General description of workflow in the IETF

   Suach a document does not exist, although the Tao ([RFC3160], to be
   replaced by [I-D.hoffman-taobis]) offers most of it informally: How
   ideas for new work enter the IETF, reach a BOF, enter IAB or IRTF
   discussion, and possibly become material for a new or existing WG.
   How WGs are chartered - the Area Director's role.  How specific
   proposals become drafts and flow through the development, review and
   approval process.

2.2.  Definition of standards track and related document types

   This material is currently embedded in [RFC2026].  Additional
   requirements for routing protocols are currently defined in
   [RFC1264].  The newtrk WG was chartered to revise the standards track
   - multiple proposals have been floated, but no conclusions have been
   reached.
   o  Specifications
      This material is currently embedded in [RFC2026], covering
      standards track, BCP and Experimental documents.  The STD
      (standard) designation is documented in [RFC1311].  A variance
      procedure for down-level normative references is in [RFC3967].  A
      specific process for advancing MIB documents is in [RFC2438].

Internet-Draft        IETF Process: Informal Guide           August 2006


   o  Information
      This material is currently embedded in [RFC2026], covering
      Informational and Historic documents.  A distinction between
      obsolete and deprecated documents is not currently made in the
      IETF.

2.3.  Intellectual Property
   o  Rights in Contributions [RFC3978]
   o  Rights in Technology [RFC3979] (Guidelines, [RFC3669])
   o  Trademarks [RFC3978]
   o  IETF Trust [RFC4371]

2.4.  Review and approval process

   This material is currently embedded in [RFC2026].
   o  Criteria for review
      Various review teams exist in different IETF Areas, with their own
      technical criteria.  For the General Area, see
      http://www.alvestrand.no/ietf/gen/art/review-guidelines.html
   o  Criteria for approval
      Material on current IESG practice can be found in
      [I-D.iesg-discuss-criteria]
      *  Appeal process
         This material is currently embedded in [RFC2026].

2.5.  Bodies involved in the process

   Bodies involved [RFC2028]; Defining the IETF [RFC3233]; Mission
   Statement [RFC3935].
   o  WG procedures [RFC2418]
   o  IESG [RFC3710]
   o  IAB [RFC2850]
      *  Liaison management [RFC4052], [RFC4053], (guidance in
         [I-D.iab-liaison-guidelines])
   o  Nomcom [RFC3777]
   o  Relationship to ISOC [RFC2031], [RFC3677]

2.6.  Conduct of participants

   See [RFC3005], [RFC3184], [RFC3683], [RFC3934]; also discussed in
   [RFC2418] and in the Tao ([RFC3160], to be replaced by
   [I-D.hoffman-taobis]).
   o  Appeal process
      This material is currently embedded in [RFC2026].

2.7.  Publication process
   o  Requirements
      [I-D.mankin-pub-req]
   o  Format and mechanics for drafts
      http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-guidelines.html
   o  Format and mechanics for archival publications
      [RFC2223] is the published version today.  The RFC Editor
      currently refers to [I-D.rfc-editor-rfc2223bis].  Those writing
      standards will find the following especially useful: [RFC2360],
      [RFC2434], [RFC3552].
   o  Direct submissions to RFC Editor [RFC3932]


2.8.  Parameter registration process
   o  Requirements [RFC2860]
   o  Guidelines [RFC2434]
   o  Format and mechanics
      Case by case at IANA web site.


2.9.  Administration

   See [RFC4071], [RFC4371], [RFC4333].

2.10.  Modifying the process

   [RFC2026] defines how process BCPs are discussed and approved.  A
   general description of how the IETF modifies its own processes does
   not exist, but probably should.  An experimental procedure is
   described in [RFC3933] (also see
   http://www.ietf.org/IESG/content/experiments.html).


3.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security implications for the Internet.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no action by the IANA.  However, it does
   mention how IANA's registration functions are documented.
