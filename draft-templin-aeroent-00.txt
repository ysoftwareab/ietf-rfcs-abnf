1.  Introduction

   Enterprise networks provide a secured data communications
   infrastructure built for the purpose of information sharing and
   increased productivity for end users within the organization.
   Enterprise networks are often organized as private Internets unto
   themselves that connect to the global Internet either not at all or
   via firewalls, proxies, and/or other network securing devices.  It is
   assumed that enterprise networks use the Internet Protocols (IP)
   [RFC0791][RFC2460] for interior routing and addressing services.

   Enterprise networks typically support two basic access methods.
   First, on-campus wired and wireless LANs allow mobile devices (e.g.,
   phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) to connect to the infrastructure
   using the physical security of a wired link or wired-equivalent
   security over wireless LANs (e.g., using IEEE802.1x, etc.).  Second,
   mobile devices that connect via the public Internet can enter the
   enterprise via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnel connection to
   an enterprise border security gateway.  In both cases, the device
   receives a Topologically-Fixed IP address (TFA) from the access link
   that would need to change if the device moves to a new link.

   Using Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO)
   [I-D.templin-aerolink], however, mobile devices can receive a

   Topology-Independent IP address or prefix (TIA) that remains stable
   even if the device's TFA changes frequently during its daily
   operations.  The TIA can moreover be uniquely associated with the
   device so that the same TIA is received every time the device
   connects to the enterprise network.  This document discusses an AERO
   enterprise network profile that outlines new and flexible methods for
   connecting, tracking and managing enterprise mobile devices.

2.  Terminology

   The terminology in the normative references applies; the following
   terms are defined within the scope of this document:

   Topologically-Fixed Address (TFA)
      an IP address assigned to a mobile device's access technology
      interface for which the address has a fixed location within the
      enterprise network routing scheme.  (For example, an IP address
      assigned to an Ethernet interface by an address provisioning
      service connected to the local link.)

   Topology-Independent Address/Prefix (TIA)
      an IP address or prefix assigned to an enterprise mobile device
      independent of any underlying access technology interfaces.  The
      IP address or prefix is maintained through the use of tunneling
      over available access technologies, and is kept separate from the
      enterprise topologically-fixed network routing scheme.  The TIA is
      one and the same as an AERO Client Prefix (ACP) as defined below.

   Asymmetrict Extended Route Optimization (AERO)
      a service for provisioning TIAs while accounting for device
      mobility and without exposing mobility events to the core
      enterprise network routing service.

   End User Device (EUD)
      an enterprise mobile device (e.g., laptop computer, tablet, smart
      phone, etc) that acts as an AERO Client.

   AERO Client ("Client")
      a node that receives a TIA within the scope of the enterprise
      network that it can use continuously wherever it roams.

   AERO Server ("Server")
      a node that provides default forwarding services for AERO Clients
      and maintains a peering session with each AERO Relay to report its
      current roster of associated Clients.

   AERO Relay ("Relay")




Templin                   Expires March 6, 2015                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               AERO Enterprise              September 2014


      a node that keeps track of all Client/Server associations and also
      serves as a gateway between the TIA and TFA address spaces.

   AERO Link
      a virtual topology over which AERO Clients, Servers and Relays can
      exchange packets as "neighbors" on the link.  The AERO link spans
      the Enterprise network as a tunnel virtual non-broadcast, multiple
      access (NBMA) link.

   AERO Service Prefix (ASP)
      a TIA prefix associated with the AERO link and from which AERO
      Client Prefixes (ACPs) are derived (for example, the IPv6 ACP
      2001:db8:1:2::/64 is derived from the IPv6 ASP 2001:db8::/32).
      The DHCPv6 server is responsible for secure management of the ASP
      and delegation of ACPs to Client.

   AERO Client Prefix (ACP)
      a more-specific TIA prefix taken from an ASP and delegated to a
      Client.

3.  A Day in the Life of an AERO Eud User

   An enterprise network mobile device user ("Bill") begins his workday
   by seating his primary EUD (e.g., a laptop computer, a tablet, a
   smart phone, etc.) in a docking station at his office desk and
   turning the device on.  The docking station connects Bill's EUD to
   the enterprise wired LAN, and the EUD receives a TFA from the
   infrastructure.  Bill's EUD further discovers an AERO Server within
   the enterprise network and requests an AERO Client Prefix (ACP)
   delegation.  Bill's EUD receives the same ACP delegation it gets
   every time it connects to the enterprise network, because the DHCPv6
   server has an administratively set mapping between the ACP and Bill's
   EUD device ID.

   Bill's EUD can then access topologically-fixed enterprise services
   using its TFA directly, and can access AERO services by using an
   address from its ACP as the source address for tunneling over the
   enterprise network.  As Bill's workday unfolds, his EUD uses the AERO
   service to interact with other EUDs in peer-to-peer sessions, join
   lengthy virtual conferencing sessions, access enterprise fileshares,
   etc.  The AERO service ensures that optimal routes are maintained so
   that tunneled communications flow over direct paths and network
   infrastructure elements are not unnecessarily over-burdened.

   While communications sessions such as the video conference are still
   in progress, Bill leaves the office to attend a meeting in a nearby
   conference room.  He disconnects his EUD from the docking station and
   in the process drops his connection to the wired LAN.  The EUD

Internet-Draft               AERO Enterprise              September 2014


   quickly enables a WiFi interface that searches for a Service Set
   Identifier (SSID) that can provide wireless access within the
   enterprise network.  The EUD authenticates itself to the network via
   the SSID using its pre-loaded certificates, and uses a securing
   mechanism such as IEEE 802.1x to assure Confidentiality, Integrity
   and Availability (CIA).  The EUD receives a new TFA from the network,
   then communicates its new ACP-to-TFA association to its current AERO
   Server(s) and any correspondent AERO Clients.  Any ongoing
   communications sessions will continue to see the same (stable) ACP.

   Bill then leaves the enterprise campus to attend an off-site customer
   meeting with his EUD still powered on and actively seeking to
   maintain network connectivity.  As Bill departs from the building,
   the WiFi signal fades until it can no longer support communications,
   and the EUD quickly enables a 4G cellular wireless interface that
   connects Bill's EUD to a cellular service provider.  The EUD then
   locates the Internet address of an enterprise network security
   gateway and initiates a VPN session with the gateway (which also acts
   as an AERO Server).  The AERO service updates the AERO link routing
   system, and Bill can continue to use the same ACP that was assigned
   to him when he started his workday even though the EUD is now
   communicating over a VPN configured over the public Internet instead
   of over the secured campus LAN.

   Bill subsequently arrives at the customer meeting at a public
   restaurant with a WiFi hotspot.  His EUD quickly powers up its WiFi
   interface and powers down the 4G interface.  The EUD uses AERO
   signaling to communicate the new TFA to the AERO Server (i.e., the
   security gateway) and the VPN survives the mobility event.  Moreover,
   the EUD can continue to use the same ACP it received at the beginning
   of the workday, and ongoing communication sessions can continue until
   Bill explicitly discontinues them.

   After the customer meeting, Bill leaves the restaurant and
   subsqeuntely passes through several additional transitions from WiFi
   hotspots to 4G wireless.  Again, the AERO service keeps the VPN
   session alive, and the ACP assigned to the EUD remains in continuous
   use in active communication sessions as well as to allow Bill to
   receive notifications and process urgent requests.  When Bill returns
   to his office, the EUD discontinues use of the VPN while keeping its
   ACP active after re-attaching to the campus LAN.

   Bill ends his workday, powers down his EUD and returns home.  Bill
   powers on his EUD to check e-mails, and connects to the enterprise
   network via a VPN configured over his home ISP service.  The EUD
   again receives the same ACP that it used within the enterprise
   network domain, and Bill can access AERO services the same as if he
   was in the office.  Bill finally shuts down for the evening, and



Templin                   Expires March 6, 2015                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               AERO Enterprise              September 2014


   begins his next workday in the same fashion.  Again, the EUD receives
   the same ACP as always regardless of the access network point of
   connection over which the EUD enters the enterprise.

   Note that the base AERO specification cannot ensure that no packet
   loss will occur during handovers between disparate media types, or
   during handovers between VPN and non-VPN connections.  However, the
   ACP remains unchanged and can be used to reach Bill's EUD at all
   times during which it is connected to the enterprise network.
   Ongoing communications between Bill's EUD and correspondent nodes can
   also often (but not always) survive mobility events.  While
   approaches exist for minimizing packet loss while a device is
   connected to the same campus LAN, there are currently no known
   methods for mitigating temporary outages when changing from a campus
   LAN connection to a VPN configured over the public Internet and vice-
   versa.

4.  AERO Network Organizational Principles

   The AERO service consists of AERO Relays, AERO Servers and AERO
   Clients.

   AERO Relays include one or more routers distributed within the
   enterprise network that each advertise the AERO Service Prefix (ASP)
   into the enterprise network topologically-fixed routing system.  The
   AERO Relays also maintain a topology-independent routing protocol
   instance over the AERO link that associates each AERO Client with one
   or more AERO Servers.  The routing protocol instance is an
   enterprise-internal BGP instance in which each Server communicates
   its Client constituency to each Relay in a unidirectional fashion
   (i.e., Relays receive routing updates from each Server, but Servers
   do not receive routing updates from Relays).  Since each Relay peers
   with each Server within the BGP routing protocol instance, there is
   no need for Relays to peer with each other.

   AERO Servers are topologically distributed throughout the enterprise
   network so that AERO Clients can discover one or more "topologically-
   close" Server.  Each Server configues a DHCPv6 server and maintains
   one or more default routes that list an AERO Relay as the next hop on
   the AERO link.  Each Server maintains state for each of its active
   Clients which were discovered through the Client's DHCPv6 prefix
   delegation exchanges [RFC3315][RFC3633].  When the AERO Server
   delegates an ACP to the Client, it creates a neighbor cache entry for
   the Client that it maintains for up to the DHCPv6 lease lifetime.
   AERO Servers that service Clients connecting directly through the
   enterprise network campus LAN are typically distributed within the
   enterprise network and need not be co-resident with any (campus LAN-
   facing) access network routers, access points, etc.  AERO Servers

   that service Clients entering the network via VPN connections across
   the Internet are also configured as enterprise border security
   gateways and are necessarily distributed along the (Internet-facing)
   enterprise perimeter.

   AERO Clients include both EUDs and any enterprise network service
   agents that are configured for access over the AERO service.  When a
   Client connects to the enterprise network, it contacts one or more
   AERO Servers to receive an ACP via a DHCPv6 prefix delegation
   exchange.  The Client then configures a default route for each Server
   it associates with over the AERO link, and can then access any AERO
   services via tunneling to the AERO Server as the first-hop gateway.
   If the AERO Client moves, it receives a new TFA from its enterprise
   network connection point and informs its Server(s) and any
   correspondents of the new TFA via IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)
   [RFC4861] exchanges.  However, the Client maintains the same stable
   ACP regardless of any mobility events.

5.  AERO Route Optimization

   When an AERO Client needs to communicate with another AERO Client,
   the source Client has to depend on AERO Servers to acquire forwarding
   information for the destination Client.  The source Client therefore
   sends a route optimization request to one of its AERO Servers.  If
   the destination Client is also associated with the same Server, the
   Server forwards the request directly to the destination Client;
   otherwise, the Server forwards the request to an AERO Relay.  Since
   the Relay has full topology knowledge of all Client/Server
   associations, the Relay therefore has enough information to forward
   the request to a Server associated with the destination Client.  The
   destination Client can then send a route optimization response back
   to the source Client as the final leg of the route optimization
   procedure.

   When a source Client enters the enterprise via a security gateway,
   the gateway serves as the Client's sole point of entry to the
   enterprise.  Direct route optimization from the source Client to a
   destination Client within the enterprise is therefore not possible.
   However, the security gateway itself can serve as a route
   optimization proxy for the source Client so that packets can travel
   from the source Client, through the security gateway, then directly
   to the destination Client without involving any additional AERO
   Relays or Servers.

   When a source Client that enters the enterprise via a VPN connection
   to a security gateway communicates with a destination Client that
   also enters the enterprise via a security gateway, a direct Client-
   to-Client route optimization could be supported if the Clients have a

Internet-Draft               AERO Enterprise              September 2014


   way to set up a private security tunnel between themselves., e.g.,
   via a dynamic key exchange protocol.  In that case, however, the
   (route-optimized) path between the Clients would be carried over the
   Internet without first passing through the enterprise network and
   hence not subject to enterprise network inspection.  The enterprise
   network must therefore establish policy as to whether such external
   Client-to-Client route optimizations are permitted.

6.  AERO Mobility Management

   When an AERO Client moves from a first TFA to a second TFA, it must
   inform its Server(s) and any correspondent Clients of the new TFA.
   To do so, the Client uses DHCPv6 and IPv6 ND messaging to update its
   Server(s) and correspondents.  As long as the Client remains
   associated with the same Server(s), however, there is no need for
   mobility events to be exposed to the Relays.

   When an AERO Client moves from a former set of Servers to a new set
   of Servers (e.g., when the Client drops its connection to the
   enterprise campus LAN and sets up a VPN link to an enterprise border
   security gateway) it must tell its old Servers "goodbye" and
   associate with the new Servers.  This movement between Servers is
   then reported to the Relays via BGP updates which track all current
   Client/Server associations.  When a Client changes rapidly from an
   old set of Servers to a new set of Servers, it may be seen by the BGP
   routing system as a "flapping" route that should be dampened.
   Clients should therefore remain with their associated Servers as long
   as possible unless and until moving to a new set of Servers would
   result in an appreciable performance advantage.

   Note that when an AERO Client moves to a new Server it need not
   inform its corespondents of the change unless the Client's TFA also
   changes.  In that case, the Client uses IPv6 ND messaging to update
   its correspondents the same as describe above.

7.  AERO Service Distribution

   A typical AERO service infrastructure in large-scale deployments
   would include O(10) AERO Relays, O(10^2) AERO Servers, and O(10^5)
   AERO Clients.  This would give a manageable distribution, and could
   be pushed to even greater scale when the numbers of Servers and
   number of Clients per Server are increased, with perhaps O(10^6) AERO
   Clients as a practical upper bound.  Based on limitations of modern
   day enterprise-grade routers, the AERO Relays would need to maintain
   at least one forwarding table entry per AERO Client so that the size
   of the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) can be managed within the
   AERO router's resource limitations.  The size of the AERO Relay FIB
   therefore becomes the limiting factor for scalability.

   By distributing the AERO Server function across many Servers, each
   Server maintains only a small subset of the overall total Client load
   and ensures that most mobility events are kept out of the AERO link
   routing system.  AERO Servers further have no requirement to
   communicate directly with each other, so that each Server only needs
   to discover a small fraction of the total Client population for the
   AERO link.

Appendix A.  Extending AERO Links Through Security Gateways

   When an enterprise mobile device moves from a campus LAN connection
   to a public Internet link, it must re-enter the enterprise via a
   security gateway.  This most often entails the establishment of a
   Virtual Private Network (VPN) link from the mobile device to the
   security gateway.  During this process, the mobile device acting as a
   Client supplies the security gateway with its public Internet
   topologically-fixed address as the link-layer address for the VPN
   (call it TFA(CLLA)).  The security gateway then supplies the mobile
   device with a topologically-fixed enterprise network-layer address
   (call it TFA(CNLA)) to be used within the enterprise.  The mobile
   device can then use TFA(CNLA) in any of its communications that need
   to speak with correspondents within the enterprise.  However, if the
   VPN session is disrupted TFA(CNLA) could be lost and a new address
   assigned the next time the VPN is established.  This prevents the
   mobile device from having a well-known enterprise-interior address
   that never changes even as the device moves.

   The AERO virtual link is configured over the enterprise and allows
   mobile devices within the campus LAN to keep the same Topology-
   Independent network layer address (TIA(CNLA)) as long as they remain
   within the campus.  It would be strongly desired to also allow use of
   the TIA(CNLA) outside of the campus when the mobile connects via a
   VPN to a security gateway, however existing security gateways have no
   way of extending the AERO virtual link through the security gateway.

   In order to satisfy this need, the security gateway can be configured
   to also operate as an AERO Server with support for AERO Client
   proxying.  In particular, when a mobile node that acts as an AERO
   Client connects via an AERO server security gateway, and the Client
   initiates the AERO messaging procedures specified in
   [I-D.templin-aerolink], the Server replaces the Client's TFA(CLLA)
   address with the Server's own TFA(SLLA) address in all AERO messages.
   The AERO messages are then delivered to other devices on the AERO
   link as if they were originated by the AERO Server instead of by the

   Server, which then replaces the Server's TFA(SLLA) address with the
   Client's TFA(CLLA) address.  The Client can then receive its
   TIA(CNLA) address the same as if it were attached to the enterprise
   campus LAN even though it is entering from a public Internet
   connection.

   After receiving the TIA(CNLA) address, the Client can send IP packets
   that use TIA(CNLA) as the network layer source address and TFA(CLLA)
   as the link-layer source address.  The security gateway (acting as an
   AERO Server) will then rewrite TFA(CLLA) with TFA(SLLA), and the
   packets will enter the enterprise network as though they were sourced
   from a device located within the enterprise.  In the reverse
   direction, when a packet sourced by a node within the enterprise
   network uses a destination address of TIA(CNLA), the packet will be
   delivered to the security gateway with link-layer destination address
   TFA(SLLA).  The security gateway then rewrites TFA(SLLA) to TFA(CLLA)
   and delivers the packet across the VPN to the AERO Client.  In this
   way, the AERO virtual link is essentially extended *through* the
   security gateway to the point at which the VPN link and AERO link are
   effectively grafted together by the link-layer address rewriting
   performed by the security gateway.  All AERO messaging services
   (including route optimization and mobility signaling) are therefore
   extended to the Client.

   In order to support this virtual link grafting, the security gateway
   (acting as an AERO Server) must keep state information about all of
   its associated Clients located on the public Internet.  This state
   information (often called neighbor cache entries) is keyed by the
   AERO Client's AERO address, which is derived directly from TIA(CNLA).
   In this way, the AERO address used for AERO messaging is
   algorithmically mapped to the TIA(CNLA) so that neighbor cache
   information is statelessly mapped to IP routing information.  The
   neighbor cache is then managed in all ways as though the Client were
   an ordinary AERO Client.

   Note that the main difference between a security gateway acting as an
   AERO Server and an enterprise-internal AERO Server is that the
   security gateway has at least one enterprise-internal physical
   interface and at least one public Internet physical interface.
   Conversely, the enterprise-internal AERO Server has only enterprise-
   internal physical interfaces.  For this reason security gateway
   proxying is needed to ensure that the public Internet link-layer
   addressing space is kept separate from the enterprise-internal link-
   layer addressing space.  This is afforded through a natural extension
   of the security association caching already performed for each VPN
   client by the security gateway.
