Abstract 

   This document proposes an IP multicast fast convergence method based 
   on differentiating primary and backup PIM join.  The multicast 
   stream is only sent along one of the multicast primary and backup 
   path, which enables the efficient multicast delivery under both 
   normal and abnormal conditions.

1. Introduction 

   This document proposes an IP multicast fast convergence method based 
   on differentiating primary and backup PIM join, which is called 
   Single Stream multicast FRR.  In this method, two multicast 
   forwarding paths are established respectively by PIM primary join 
   and backup join.  Under normal conditions, only primary path is used 
   to make the multicast data delivery.  If the node or link on the 
   primary path fails, the multicast data forwarding is switched to the 
   backup path. 

   Because either primary or backup nodes forward multicast data 
   packets, they should be able to identify on which path they are 
   located and to take appropriate forwarding action according to this 
   information.  One feasible solution is to include a new join 
   attribute in a PIM backup join message.  During the transmission of 
   the joins hop-by-hop on the backup path, the node(s) of backup path 
   are disabled for data forwarding when creating the multicast 
   forwarding entries.  If the failure is detected on the primary path, 
   the backup path is notified and the forwarding entry on backup path 
   node which was previously disabled is enabled for data forwarding.  

   The Single stream FRR solution has the advantages of implementing 
   fast multicast protection and of avoiding double multicast bandwidth 
   occupation in both normal and abnormal situations. 

2. Principle of Single Stream Solution 

2.1. Primary and Backup Path Setup 

   The backup multicast path is set up using backup PIM join.  The join 
   is sent by the initiating node of the backup path from the backup IP 
   FRR upstream interface or from a statically configured backup 
   interface towards the multicast source.  The join is transmitted 
   hop-by-hop upwards and is terminated when reaching the root of the 
   multicast tree (i.e. Source DR or RP), or when merging with primary 
   forwarding states created by primary join.  On the merging point, 
   only the primary states are maintained. 

   The forwarding state(s) on backup path are disabled by default for 
   data forwarding when being created by the backup joins, which 
   requires the backup join to be flagged to be differentiated from the 
   primary ones.  A new join attribute [RFC5384] (referred to as e.g. 
   Multicast FRR join Attribute, or MFA), is suggested to be introduced 
   to serve this purpose and a new hello option for this attribute 
   should be defined to negotiate this capability.  The format of the

   attribute and its hello option are respectively defined in section 
   3.1 and 3.2 

   To make precise switching from a primary path to a backup path for 
   multiple load-balancing primary paths, an additional identification 
   for the primary path should be included in the MFA attribute of a 
   backup join.  The primary path ID could be the interface ID of a 
   router ID, or a logic number configured for the primary path.  In 
   some cases multiple primary path IDs have to be included in the 
   backup join and they have to be merged when backup join has to be 
   sent upwards.  PIM incremental mechanism [PORT] could be used in 
   these cases to reduce information to be carried in the backup joins. 

   The establishing of primary path could be a normal PIM join process.  
   In this case an ordinary PIM join is generated on the initiating 
   node of primary path and is sent hop-by-hop upstream until the join 
   arrives at the root of the tree or at the other valid forwarding 
   branch. 

2.2. Fault Processing 

   The fault on the primary path could be detected by using some fault 
   detection mechanism (e.g. BFD protocol), which is configured to be 
   run between each pair of PIM neighbors.  If error condition occurs, 
   the node on the upstream or downstream of the error point will 
   possibly detect it and should pass this error condition to the 
   backup path, and enable multicast data forwarding on it. 

   As the node on the primary path detects a failure, it could flood 
   the failure notification packet to all its PIM neighbors.  Then the 
   notification will reach to all the PIM routers in the area.  To 
   prevent excessive transmission of these packets, the sending and 
   forwarding of the packets should be rate-limited.  The fault 
   notification like this can be implemented by extending BFD or other 
   protocol, which is not covered by this document. 

   When backup node(s) receive the notification packets, they will 
   enable the multicast forwarding which was previous disabled.  To 
   select correct data stream switching to the backup path, the 
   information of primary path ID should be carried in the notification.  
   And prior to that, the backup path should record the primary path ID 
   for corresponding multicast forwarding entries during backup join 
   operation.  

   After the enabling of the backup path, the multicast data will be 
   forwarded along the path downstream to the initiating node of the

   backup path.  The backup path initiating point then changes the 
   backup incoming interface (IIF) as its RPF interface if no data is 
   available from the primary IIF. 

   If primary path heals, multicast forwarding could choose to switch 
   back to the primary path.  The primary join will be generated hop-
   by-hop to set up the primary path, as illustrated in section 2.1.  
   Once the data is received from the primary IIF, the initiating node 
   will change its RPF interface to its primary IIF.  The node may also 
   send a PIM prune message to tear down the backup path, and may 
   possibly after waiting for a specified period of time, re-setup the 
   backup path without stream using the same process as described in 
   section 2.1.  

3. The Definition of packet format  

3.1. Multicast FRR join Attribute 

   The format of the join attribute is defined as: 

    
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   | F| E| Attr_Type |    Length    |    Flags     |  Path Count   | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                            Path   ID                          | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   ~                              . . .                            ~ 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                            Path   ID                          | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
    
   - F-bit, Transitive Attribute.  If this bit is set, the attribute is 
   a transitive attribute; otherwise, it is a non-transitive attribute 
   [RFC5384]. 

   - E-bit, End of Attributes.  If this bit is set, then this is the 
   last Join Attribute appearing in the Encoded-Source Address field 
   specified by [RFC5384]. 

   - Attr_Type, Type of the Attribute. It should be set to a new value 
   (e.g.) for this MFA join attribute, e.g., taking value of 8. 

   - Length, a 1-octet field specifying the length in octets, encoded 
   as an unsigned binary integer, of the value field.

   - Flags, flag for primary or backup join. 0 is for a primary join, 1 
   for backup join.  

   - Path Count, the number of path included following Path ID. 

   - Path ID, the Identification for this path. 

    
3.2. PIM multicast FRR Hello Options 

   This multicast FRR Hello options are used for the PIM neighbors to 
   negotiate the capability of multicast FRR join attribute.  It has 
   the format prescribed in [RFC5384] and the OptionType is defined a 
   new value representing this MFA attribute. 

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |        OptionType             |             OptionLength      | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                       OptionValue                             | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   - OptionType = 38 

   - OptionLength = 8 

   - OptionValue, reserved for future use 

4. Scenario Analysis for Single Stream Forwarding 

4.1. Disabling all nodes on backup path 

   In this method, when backup join is transmitted to set up the backup 
   path, the backup forwarding states of all the nodes are by default 
   disabled for multicast data forwarding when being created.  When 
   backup join arrives at a primary node that has primary forwarding 
   state, it is ''absorbed'' and will not created any backup state there.  

   Because each backup path will be merged at transit or root node of a 
   multicast tree, and each node on this backup path could be disabled 
   or enabled for data forwarding, it is possible to implement 
   relatively precise control of path switching.

           /   \  /                              RT5  - RT6         
         RT5    RT6                                           
                                                                 
           Figure 1                               Figure 2  
    
   Figure 1 is an example of an arbitrary tree topology.  Supposing RT6 
   has a downstream receiver and it is the initiating node of both the 
   primary and backup path for this receiver.  Then RT1-RT2-RT3-RT6 is 
   setup as the primary path by primary join, and RT2-RT4-RT6 as the 
   backup path by backup join.  The backup forwarding states for the 
   backup path, i.e. the outgoing interfaces of RT2 (the one towards 
   RT4) and RT4 (towards RT6) are all disabled for multicast forwarding.  
   Only primary path imports multicast stream through RT2 to RT6 and to 
   the receiver. 

   If link between RT3 and RT6 goes down, the failure will be detected 
   and be notified to RT2 and RT4 on backup path.  They will be enabled 
   the data forwarding on their outgoing interface, and the data will 
   be imported from RT2, through RT4, to RT6 and the receiver. 

   In the ring topology shown in figure 2, supposing RT3 has a receiver 
   downstream, the primary path for it is RT1-RT3 and takes the duty of 
   data forwarding.  The backup path is RT2-RT4-RT6-RT5-RT3 and the 
   backup outgoing interface on each of them is disabled when the 
   forwarding state is created.  If link between RT1 and RT3 breaks, 
   the failure will be detected and be notified to RT2, RT4, RT6, and 
   RT5.  They will enable their data forwarding, and the traffic will 
   be delivered along backup path to RT3 and to the receiver.  Each 
   node on the ring processes in the similar manner, if it has 
   downstream multicast receiver.  If any upstream failure on the 
   primary path occurs, the node will turn to receive reverse stream 
   from the backup path. 

4.2. Disabling only root node on backup path 

   In this method, when backup join is sent hop-by-hop to setup the 
   backup path, only the root node is disabled of its multicast data 
   forwarding.  The forwarding states on other nodes on the backup path 
   are kept normal.  In normal condition, the only stream comes from 
   the primary path established by the primary join.  If error occurs 
   on the primary path, the root node of the backup path is notified of

   the failure, it then enables its data forwarding and the data stream 
   will be delivered from the backup path to the receiver.   

   The primary join and backup join in this method can be used to setup 
   primary and backup trees.  In normal condition, only primary tree 
   makes the multicast forwarding.  When failure occurs on the primary 
   tree, the root node of the backup tree could be notified to open its 
   data forwarding and the multicast data will delivered over the 
   backup tree to the receiver. 

5. Security Considerations 

   They will be described in the later version of this draft.
