                    Support for Notifications in CCN
                     draft-ravi-ccn-notification-01

Abstract

   This draft proposes a new packet primitive called Notification for
   CCN.  Notification is a PUSH primitive and can be unicast or
   multicast to multiple listening points.  Notifications do not expect
   a Content Object response hence only requires the use of FIB state in
   the CCN forwarder.  Emulating Notification as a PULL has performance
   and forwarding implications.  The draft proposes a new fixed header
   primitive called Notification and a CCN message encoding using
   Content Object primitive to transport Notifications.  These
   discussions are presented in the context of CCNx1.0 [1] proposal.

1.  Introduction

   Notification is a PUSH primitive used in the Internet today by many
   IoT and social applications.  The nature of notifications varies with
   the application scenario, ranging from being mission critical to one
   that is best effort.  Notifications can be unicast or multicast
   depending on whether the notification service is aware of all the
   consumers or not.  A notification service is preceded by a consumer
   subscribing to a specific event such as, subscription to hash-tag
   feeds, health emergency notification service, or temperature sensor
   reading from a room in a building; following this subscription the
   service pushes notifications to consuming entities.  It has to be
   noted that certain IoT applications expects notification end-to-end
   latency of few milliseconds [2].  Industrial IoT applications have
   more stringent requirement in terms of QoS, timeliness, and
   reliability of message delivery.  Though we term it as a
   Notification, this primitive can also be used for transactional
   exchange between two points.

   CCN optimizes networking around efficiently distributing already
   published content which the consumers learn through mechanisms like

Internet-Draft            Interest Notification               March 2016


   manifests containing the names of published content chunks and their
   locations.  Applications relying on notifications requires event
   driven data to be pushed from multiple producers to multiple
   subscribers for which the current Interest/Data primitive is
   inefficient.  This draft proposes to extend CCN's current primitives
   set with a new notification primitive that can be processed in a new
   way by the CCN forwarder to serve notification objectives.
   Notification here implies a PUSH semantic that is available with IP
   today and supported by other FIA architectures like MobilityFirst
   [10] and XIA [11].

2.  Notification Requirements in CCN

   General notification requirements have been discussed in CoAP's
   Observe proposal [4] to push notifications from the server to the
   clients.  Here we discuss basic notification requirements from CCN's
   network layer perspective.  Other requirements related to
   reliability, low latency, flow control can be engineered by the
   application or through more network layer state once the following
   requirements are met.

   o  Supporting PUSH Intent: CCN should provide efficient support for
      PUSH, where application's intent is able to PUSH content to
      listening application without expecting any data in return.

   o  Support Multicast: CCN network should be able to handle multicast
      notifications from a producer to multiple consumers for any
      service.

   o  Security: Just as a content object in the context of Interest/Data
      primitive provides data authentication and privacy, similar
      features should also be offered to notification objects.

   o  Routing/Forwarding Support: Name prefixes over which multicast
      notifications are managed should be handled in a different manner
      from the name prefixes over which Interest/Data primitive is used
      for content distribution.  This differentiation applies both to
      the control as well as the forwarding plane.

   o  Minimizing Processing: Notification processing in the forwarder
      should be minimized considering the application's intent to PUSH
      data to listening consumers.

3.  Current Approaches

   Recent CCN and NDN research [6] [7] have studied the problem of
   handling notifications and have proposed several solutions to handle
   this.  However these approaches are not satisfactory as they use the



Ravindran, et al.      Expires September 22, 2016               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft            Interest Notification               March 2016


   current Interest and Data primitive to achieve notification
   objectives.  These approaches are:

   o  Polling: This is a straight forward application of the Interest
      and Data primitive, where consumers periodically checks the
      producers for any new information.  The efficiency of this
      approach depends on the frequency of polling.  In this case, very
      low frequency may result in missing critical updates, and large
      frequency could result in high PIT occupancy by such polling
      Interests and overall higher traffic overhead.  This scheme is
      inefficient particularly for event driven and asynchronous
      updates.

   o  Long lived Interests: As the name suggests, applications can issue
      Interests set to a high lifetime to the producing nodes.
      Considering the increasing social networking and IoT application
      traffic, the number of such PIT Interests can be very large
      occupying valuable resources.

   o  Interest overloading: Small notifications such as actuating
      commands can be send by overloading the Interest primitive by
      adding information as suffixes to the name or including signed
      and/or encrypted data as a Interest payload [1].  As these
      Interests are used as notifications, their lifetime is set to
      zero.  Overloading Interests to convey notifications may not be
      desirable, as today the Interests are treated as a content request
      primitive by forwarders incurring unnecessary PIT/CS incurring
      unnecessary overhead.  This also opens the possibility of new
      attack vectors, such as the notifications can be blocked by
      malicious consumers who may express Interests with the same name
      (assuming names are easily derivable).

   o  Interest Trigger: Another way to use Interest is to first notify
      the consumers about a produced data, and then have the data pulled
      by the consumers.  This use of Interest for notification is also
      inefficient as Interest (that intends notification) is processed
      as a content fetch request by the router, incurring additional
      round trip delay before the produced data arrives at the listening
      consumer.  To be more specific it incurs a minimum of 4 messages,
      but more messages for the same reliability and robustness as TCP.

   To summarize CCN and NDN operates on PULL primitive optimized for
   content distribution applications.  Emulating PUSH operation over
   PULL has the following issues: 1) it is a mismatch between an
   application's intent to PUSH data and the PULL APIs currently
   available; 2) unless Interests are marked distinctly, overloading
   Interests with notification data will undergo PIT/CS processing and
   are also subjected to similar routing and forwarding policies as



Ravindran, et al.      Expires September 22, 2016               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            Interest Notification               March 2016


   regular Interests which is inefficient; 3) another concern in
   treating PUSH as PULL is with respect to the effect of local strategy
   layer routing policies, where applying the intent to experiment with
   multiple faces to fetch content is not required for notification
   messages.

   This motivates the need for treating notifications as a separate
   class of traffic which would allow a forwarder to apply the
   appropriate processing, routing and forwarding processing in the
   network.

4.  Proposed Notification Primitive in CCN

   Notification is a new type of packet hence can be subjected to
   different processing logic by a forwarder.  By definition, a
   notification message is a PUSH primitive, hence is not subjected to
   PIT/CS processing.  This primitive can also be used by any other
   transactional or content distribution application towards service
   authentication or exchanging contextual information between end
   points and the service.

5.  Notification Message Encoding

   The wire packet format for a Notification is shown in Fig. 1 and Fig.
   2.  Fig. 1 shows the Notification fixed header considering the
   CCNx1.0 encoding, and Fig. 2 shows the format for the CCN
   Notification message, which is used to transport the notification
   data.  We next discuss these two packet segments of the Notification
   message.

                                    Figure 2: CCN Notification Message


   Notification Fixed Header: The fields in the fixed header that have
   new meaning in the context of notifications are discussed next, while
   the other fields follow the definition in [1].

   o  Packet Type: This new type code identifies that the packet is of
      type Notification [TBD].

   o  Optional Hop-by-hop header TLVs : Encodes any new hop-by-hop
      headers relevant to notifications [TBD].

   CCN Notification message: The CCN Notification message is a Content
   Object as in [1].  Notifications are always routed on the top level
   Content Object (outer CO) name.  Notification itself can be encoded
   in two forms depending on the application requirement:

   o  Notification with single name: In this case the notification
      contains a single content object.  Here the producer generates
      notification using the same name used by consumers on which they
      listen on.

   o  Notification with two names: In this case the notification
      contains a top level Content Object (outer CO), that encapsulates
      another Content Object (inner CO).  With an encapsulated Content
      Object, the meaning is that notification producers and consumers
      operate on different name-spaces requiring separate name-data
      security binding.  A good application of the encapsulation format
      is a PUB/SUB service, where the consumer learns about the



Ravindran, et al.      Expires September 22, 2016               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            Interest Notification               March 2016


      notification service name offline, and the producer who is
      decoupled from the consumer generates a new Content Object using
      its own name and pushes the notification to the consumer.

   The interpretation of the fields shown in Fig. 2 are as follows:

   o  MessageType : The CCN message type is of type Content Object.

   o  Name TLV : Name TLV in the Content Object is used to route the
      Notification.

   o  Optional Metadata TLV: These TLVs carry metadata used to describe
      the Notification payload.

   o  Message Payload Type: This is of type T_PAYLOADTYPE defined in
      CCNx.1.0 or a new encapsulation type (T_ENCAP) that indicates the
      presence of another encapsulated Content Object [TBD].

   o  Optional Encapsulated Content Object: This is an optional
      encapsulated Content Object newly defined for the Notification
      primitive.  The name in the encapsulated Content Object
      corresponds to the producer's name-space, or anything else based
      on the application logic.  The rational for an encapsulated
      Content Object was discussed earlier.

   o  Optional Security Validation data: The Content Object optionally
      carries security validation payload as per CCNx1.0.

6.  Notification Processing

   The following steps are followed by a CCN forwarder to process the
   Notification packet.

   o  Notification packet type is identified in the fixed header of a
      CCN packet with a new type code.  The Notification carries a
      Content Object, whose name is used for routing.  This name is
      matched against the FIB entries to determine the next hop(s).
      Novel strategy layer routing techniques catering to the
      notification traffic can be applied here.

   o  CCN forwarder also processes the optional metadata associated with
      the Notification meant for the network to help with the forwarding
      strategy, for e.g., mission critical notifications can be given
      priority over all other traffic.

   o  As mentioned earlier, CCN forwarder MUST NOT cache the Content
      Objects in the notifications.

Internet-Draft            Interest Notification               March 2016


7.  Security Considerations

   The proposed processing logic of Notifications that bypass the
   processing of PIT/CS has the following security implications:

   Flow Balance : PIT state maintains the per-hop flow balance over all
   the available faces by enforcing a simple rule, that is, one Content
   Object is send over a face for a single Interest.  Bypassing PIT
   processing compromises this flow balancing property.  For scenarios
   where the notification traffic volume is not high such as for IoT
   applications, the impact may not be significant.  However, this may
   not be the case considering the plethora of social networking and
   emerging IoT applications in a general Internet scenario.  This flow
   balance tradeoff has to be understood considering an application's
   intent to PUSH data and the latency introduced by processing such
   traffic if a PULL primitive is used.  Also PIT offers a natural
   defense mechanism by throttling traffic at the network edge,
   considering the provisioned PIT size, and bypassing it could
   exacerbate DDOS attacks on producing end points.

   Cache Poisoning: This draft doesn't recommend the caching of the
   Content Object in the Notification payload, though doing so might
   help in increasing the availability of notification information in
   the network.  A possible exception would be if the inner CO is a
   nameless object [12]. as those can only be fetched from CS by hash We
   leave this possibility of applying policy-based caching of
   Notification Content Objects for future exploration.  The
   recommendation for not caching these Content objects is that, in a
   regular Interest/Content Object exchange, content arrives at the
   forwarder and is cached as a result of per-hop active Interest
   expression.  Unsolicited Content Objects, as in the case of the
   Notification, violates this rule, which could be exploited by
   malicious producers to generate DDOS attack against the cache
   resource of a CCN infrastructure.

8.  Annex

8.1.  Routing Notifications

   Appropriate routing policies should be employed to ensure reliable
   forwarding of a notification to its one or many intended receivers.
   The name in the notification identifies a host or a multicast service
   being listened to by the multiple intended receivers.  Two types of
   routing strategies can be adopted to handle notifications, depending
   on whether or not an explicit pub/sub state is maintained in the
   forwarder.





Ravindran, et al.      Expires September 22, 2016               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            Interest Notification               March 2016


   o  Stateless forwarding: In this case the notification only relies on
      the CCN FIB state to route the notification.  The FIB entries are
      populated through a routing control plane, which distinguishes the
      FIB states for the notification service from the content fetching
      FIB entries.  Through this logical separation, Notifications can
      be routed by matching its name with the matching FIB policy in the
      CCN forwarder, hence processed as notification multicast.

   o  Stateful forwarding: In this case, specific subscription state is
      managed in the forwarder to aid notification delivery.  This is
      required to scale notifications at the same time apply
      notification policies, such as filter notifications or to improve
      notification reliability and efficiency to subscribing users [8].

8.2.  Notification reliability

   This proposal doesn't provide any form of reliability.  Reliability
   can be realized by the specific application using the proposed
   notification primitive, for instance using the following potential
   approaches:

   Caching: This proposal doesn't propose any form of caching.  But
   caching feature can be explored to improve notification reliability,
   and this is a subject of future study.  For instance, consumers,
   which expect notifications and use external means (such as periodic
   updates or by receiving manifests) to track notifications, can
   recover the lost notifications using the PULL feature of CCN.

   Notification Acknowledgment: If the producer maintains per-receiver
   state, then the consumer can send back notification ACK or NACK to
   the producer of having received or not received them.

8.3.  Use Case Scenarios

   Here we provide the discussions related to the use of Notification in
   different scenarios.

8.3.1.  Realizing PUB/SUB System

   A PUB/SUB system provides a service infrastructure for subscribers to
   request update on a set of topics of interest, and with multicast
   publishers publishing content on those topics.  A PUB/SUB system maps
   the subscribers' interests to published contents and pushes them as
   Notifications to the subscribers.  A PUB/SUB system has many
   requirements as discussed in [6] which include low latency,
   reliability, fast recovery, scalability, security, minimizing false
   (positive/negative) notifications.

Internet-Draft            Interest Notification               March 2016


   Current IP based PUB/SUB systems suffer from interoperability
   challenges because of application-defined naming approach and lack of
   support of multicast in the data plane.  The proposed Notification
   primitive can be used to realize large scale PUB/SUB system, as it
   unifies naming in the network layer and support for name-based
   multicasting.

   Depending on the routing strategy discussed earlier, two kind of PUB/
   SUB approaches can be realized : 1) Rendezvous style approach ; 2)
   Distributed approach.  Each of these approaches can use the
   Notification primitive to implement their PUSH service.

   In the Rendezvous style approach, a logically centralized service
   maps subscriber's topic interest with the publisher's content and
   pushes it as notifications.  If stateless forwarding is used, the
   routing entries contain specific application-ID's requesting a given
   notification, to handle scalability, a group of these application can
   share a multicast-ID reducing the state in the FIB.

   In the Distributed approach, the CCN/NDN protocol is further enhanced
   with new subscription primitive for the subscription interested
   consumers.  When a consumer explicitly susbcribes to a multicast
   topic, its subscription request is forwarded to the upstream
   forwarder which manages this state mapping between subscription names
   to the downstream faces which has expressed interest for
   Notifications being pushed under that prefix.  An example of the
   network layer based approach is the COPSS notification proposal [6].
   Here a PUB/SUB multi-cast state state, called the subscribers
   interest table, is managed in the forwarders.  When a Notification
   arrives at a forwarder, the content descriptor in the notification is
   matched to the PUB/SUB state in the forwarder to decide the faces
   over which the Notification has to be forwarded.
