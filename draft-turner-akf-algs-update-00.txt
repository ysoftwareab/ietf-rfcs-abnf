1. Introduction 

   [I-D.turner-asymmetrickeyformat-algs] describes conventions necessary 
   to protect the AsymmetricKeyPackage content type [I-D.turner-
   asymmetrickeyformat] with Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) 
   protecting content types: SignedData [RFC5652], EnvelopedData 
   [RFC5652], EncryptedData [RFC5652], AuthenticatedData [RFC5652], and 
   AuthEnvelopedData [RFC5083].  This document extends the algorithms 
   used with SignedData and EnvelopedData to include Elliptic Curve 
   Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman 
   (ECDH).  Familiarity with [I-D.turner-asymmetrickeyformat-algs] and 
   [RFC5753] is assumed. 

   This document does not define any new algorithms instead it refers to 
   previously defined algorithms.  

1.1. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
   [RFC2119]. 

2. AsymmetricKeyPackage 

   As noted in Asymmetric Key Packages [I-D.turner-asymmetrickeyformat], 
   CMS can be used to protect the AsymmetricKeyPackage.  The following 
   provides guidance for SignedData [RFC5652] and EnvelopedData 
   [RFC5652] when used with Elliptic Curve algorithms. 

2.1. SignedData 

   If an implementation supports SignedData, then it MAY support ECDSA  
   [I-D.mcgrew-fundamental-ecc].

2.2. EnvelopedData 

   When key agreement is used, ECDH [I-D.mcgrew-fundamental-ecc] MAY be 
   supported. 

3. Public Key Sizes 

   The easiest way to implement the SignedData and EnvelopedData is with 
   public key certificates [RFC5280][RFC5480]. If an implementation 
   supports ECDSA or ECDH, then it MUST support keys on P-256. 

4. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations from [RFC5280], [RFC5480], [RFC5652], 
   [RFC5753], [I-D.turner-asymmetrickeyformat-algs], and 
   [I-D.mcgrew-fundamental-ecc] apply. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   None.  Please remove this section prior to publication as an RFC.
