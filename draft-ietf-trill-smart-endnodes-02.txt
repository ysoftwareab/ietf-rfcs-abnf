Abstract

   This draft addresses the problem of the size and freshness of the
   endnode learning table in edge RBridges, by allowing endnodes to
   volunteer for endnode learning and encapsulation/decapsulation.  Such
   an endnode is known as a "Smart Endnode".  Only the attached RBridge
   can distinguish a "Smart Endnode" from a "normal endnode".  The smart
   endnode uses the nickname of the attached RBridge, so this solution
   does not consume extra nicknames.  The solution also enables Fine
   Grained Label aware endnodes.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
   protocol [RFC6325] provides optimal pair-wise data frame forwarding
   without configuration, safe forwarding even during periods of
   temporary loops, and support for multipathing of both unicast and
   multicast traffic.  TRILL accomplishes this by using IS-IS [IS-IS]
   [RFC7176] link state routing and encapsulating traffic using a header
   that includes a hop count.  Devices that implement TRILL are called
   "RBridges" (Routing Bridges) or "TRILL Switches".

   An RBridge that attaches to endnodes is called an "edge RBridge" or
   "edge TRILL Swtich", whereas one that exclusively forwards
   encapsulated frames is known as a "transit RBridge" or "transit TRILL



Perlman, et al.         Expires February 18, 2016               [Page 2]

   Switch".  An edge RBridge traditionally is the one that encapsulates
   a native Ethernet packet with a TRILL header, or that receives a
   TRILL-encapsulated packet and decapsulates the TRILL header.  To
   encapsulate efficiently, the edge RBridge must keep an "endnode
   table" consisting of (MAC, Data Label, TRILL egress switch nickname)
   sets, for those remote MAC addresses in Data Labels currently
   communicating with endnodes to which the edge RBridge is attached.

   These table entries might be configured, received from ESADI
   [RFC7357], looked up in a directory [RFC7067], or learned from
   decapsulating received traffic.  If the edge RBridge has attached
   endnodes communicating with many remote endnodes, this table could
   become large.  Also, if one of the MAC addresses and Data Labels in
   the table has moved to a different remote TRILL switch, it might be
   difficult for the edge RBridge to notice this quickly, and because
   the edge RBridge is encapsulting to the incorrect egress RBridge, the
   traffic will get lost.

2.  Solution Overview

   The Smart Endnode solution proposed in this document addresses the
   problem of the size and freshness of the endnode learning table in
   edge RBridges.  An endnode E, attached to an edge RBridge R, tells R
   that E would like to be a "Smart Endnode", which means that E will
   encapsulate and decapsulate the TRILL frame, using R's nickname.
   Because E uses R's nickname, this solution does not consume extra
   nicknames.

   Take the below figure as the example Smart Endnode scenario: RB1, RB2
   and RB3 are the RBridges in the TRILL domain, and smart SE1 and SE2
   are the smart ennodes which can encapsulate and decapsulate the TRILL
   frames.  RB1 is the edge attached RB for SE1 and SE2, and assigns its
   nickname to SE1 and SE2.

   Each Smart Endnode, SE1 and SE2, uses RB1's nickname when
   encapsulating, and maintains an endnode table of (MAC, label, TRILL
   egress switch nickname) for remote endnodes that it (SE1 or SE2) is
   corresponding with.  RB1 does not decapsulate packets destined for
   SE1 or SE2, and does not learn (MAC, label, TRILL egress switch
   nickname) for endnodes corresponding with SE1 or SE2, but RB1 does
   decapsulate, and does learn (MAC, label, TRILL egress switch
   nickname) for any endnodes attached to RB1 that have not declared
   themselves to be Smart Endnodes.

   Just as an RBridge learns and times out (MAC, label, TRILL egress
   switch nickname), Smart Endnodes SE1 and SE2 also learn and time out
   endnode entries.  However, SE1 and SE2 might also determine, through
   ICMP messages or other techniques, that an endnode entry is not

   successfully reaching the destination endnode, and can be deleted,
   even if the entry has not timed out.

   If SE1 wishes to correspond with destination MAC D, and no endnode
   entry exists, SE1 will encapsulate the packet as an unknown
   destination, or examining updates to the ESADI link state database
   [RFC7357],or consulting a directory [RFC7067] (just as an RBridge
   would do if there was no endnode entry).

  +----------+
  |SE1(Smart |
  |Endnode1) |  \      +------------------------------+
  +----------+   \    /                                \
                  \  /+------+   +------+    +-----+    \   +----------+
                  /-+-| RB 1 |---|  RB2 |----| RB3 |-----+--| Endnode1 |
                 /  | +------+   +------+    +-----+     |  +----------+
  +----------+ /     \                                  /
  |SE2(Smart |        \                                /
  | Endnode2)|         +------------------------------+
  +----------+
                     Figure 1 Smart Endnode Scenario

   The mechanism in this draft is that the Smart Endnode SE1 issues a
   Smart-Hello, indicating SE1's desire to act as a Smart Endnode,
   together with the set of MAC addresses and Data Labels that SE1 owns,
   and whether SE1 would like to receive ESADI packets.  The Smart-Hello
   is a light type of TRILL-hello, which is used to announce the Smart
   Endnode capability and parameters (such as MAC address, VLAN ID
   etc.).  The detailed content for a smart endnode's Smart-Hello is
   defined in section 4.

   If RB1 supports having a Smart Endnode neighbor it also sends Smart-
   Hellos.  The smart endnode learns from RB1's Smart-Hellos what RB1's
   nickname is and which trees RB1 can use when RB1 ingresses multi-
   destination frames.  Although Smart Endnode SE1 transmits Smart-
   Hellos, it does not transmit or receive LSPs or E-L1FS FS-
   LSPs[I-D.ietf-trill-rfc7180bis].

   Since a Smart Endnode can encapsulate TRILL Data frames, it can cause
   the Inner.Lable to be a Fine Grained Label [RFC7172], thus this
   method supports FGL aware endnodes.

3.  Terminology

4.  Smart-Hello Mechanism between Smart Endnode and RBridge

   The subsections below describe Smart-Hello messages.

4.1.  Smart-Hello Encapsulation

   Although a Smart Endnode is not an RBridge, does not send LSPs, and
   does not perform routing calculations, it is required to have a
   "Hello" mechanism (1) to announce to edge RBridges that it is a Smart
   Endnode and (2) to tell them what MAC addresses it is handling in
   what Data Labels.  Similarly, an edge RBridge that supports Smart
   Endnodes needs a message (1) to announce that support, (2) to inform
   Smart Endnodes what nickname to use for ingress and what nickname(s)
   can be used as multi-destination TRILL data packet, and (3) the list
   of smart end nodes it knows about on that link.

   The messages sent by Smart Endnodes and by edge RBridges that support
   Smart Endnodes are called "Smart-Hellos" and are carried through
   native RBridge channel messages (see Section 4 of [RFC7178]).  They
   are structured as follows:

            +----------+----------------+-------------+----------+
            | Ethernet | RBridge        | Smart-Hello | Ethernet |
            | Header   | Channel Header | Payload     | FCS      |
            +----------+----------------+-------------+----------+

                          Figure 2  Smart-Hello Structure

Internet-Draft            TRILL Smart Endnodes               August 2015


   In the Ethernet Header, the source MAC address is the address of the
   Smart Endnode or edge RBridge port on which the message is sent.  If
   the Smart-Hello is sent by a Smart Endnode and multicasted in the
   link, the destination MAC address is All-Edge-RBridges, and if the
   Smart-Hello is unicasted to an edge RBridge, the destination MAC
   address is the MAC address of the RBridge.  If the Smart-Hello is
   sent by an Edge RBridge and multicasted in the link, the destination
   MAC address is TRILL-End-Stations, and if it is unicasted to a Smart
   Endnode, the MAC address is the MAC address of the Smart Endnode.
   The frame is sent in the Designated VLAN of the link so if a VLAN tag
   is present, it specifies that VLAN.

   The RBridge Channel Header begins with the RBridge Channel Ethertype.
   In the RBridge Channel Header, the Channel Protocol number is as
   assigned by IANA (see Section 8) and in the flags field, the NA bit
   is one, the MH bit is zero and the setting of the SL bit is an
   implementation choice.

   The Smart-Hello Payload, both for Smart-Hellos sent by Smart Endnodes
   and for Smart-Hellos sent by Edge RBridges, consists of TRILL IS-IS
   TLVs as described in the following two sub-sections.  The non-
   extended format is used so TLVs, sub-TLVs, and APPsub-TLVs have an
   8-bit size and type field.  Both types of Smart-Hellos MUST include a
   Smart-Parameters APPsub-TLV as follows inside a TRILL GENINFO TLV:

                 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
                 |Smart-Parameters|                 (1 byte)
                 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

                 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                 | Flags                         |  (2 bytes)

                   Figure 3 Smart Parameters APPsub-TLV

      Type: APPsub-TLV type Smart-Parameters, value is TBD.

      Length: 4.

      Holding Time: A time in seconds as an unsigned integer.  Has the
      same meaning as the Holding Time field in IS-IS Hellos [ISIS].  A
      Smart Endnode and an Edge RBridge supporting Smart Endndoes MUST
      send a Smart-Hello at least three times during their Holding Time.
      If no Smart-Hellos is received from a Smart Endnode or Edge
      RBridge within the most recent Holding Time it sent, it is assumed
      that it is no longer available.

      Flags: At this time all of the Flags are reserved and MUST be send
      as zero and ignored on receipt.

   If more than one Smart Parameters APPsub-TLv appears in a Smart-
   Hello, the first one is used and any following ones are ignored.  If
   no Smart Parameters APPsub-TLV appears in a Smart-Hello, that Smart-
   Hello is ignored.

4.2.  Edge RBridge's Smart-Hello

   The edge RBridge's Smart-Hello contains the following information in
   addition to the Smart-Parameters APPsub-TLV:

   o  RBridge's nickname.  The nickname sub-TLV (Specified in section
      2.3.2 in [RFC7176])is reused here carried inside a TLV 242 (IS-IS
      router capability) in a Smart-Hello frame.  If more than one
      nickname appears in the Smart-Hello, the first one is used and the
      following ones are ignored.

   o  Trees that RB1 can use when ingressing multi-destination frames.
      The Tree Identifiers Sub-TLV (Specified in section 2.3.4 in
      [RFC7176]) is reused here.

   o  Smart Endnode neighbor list.  The TRILL Neighbor TLV (Specified in
      section 2.5 in [RFC7176]) is reused for this purpose.

   o  An Autentication TLV MAY also be included.

4.3.  Smart Endnode's Smart-Hello

   A new APPsub-TLV (Smart-MAC TLV) is defined for use by Smart Endnodes
   as defined below.  In addition, there will be a Smart-Parameters
   APPsub-TLV and there MAY be an Authentication TLV in a Smart Endnode
   Smart-Hello.

   If there are several VLANs/FGL Data Labels for that Smart Endnode,
   the Smart-MAC APPsub-TLV is included several times in Smart Endnode's
   Smart-Hello.  This APPsub-TLV appears inside a TRILL GENINFO TLV.

      should receive ESADI frames.

   o  F: one bit.  If it sets to 1, which indicates that the endnode
      supports FGL data label, otherwise, the VLAN/FGL Data Label
      [RFC7172] field is the VLAN ID.

   o  RSV: 2 bits or 6 bits, is reserved for the future use.  If VLAN/
      FGL Data Label indicates the VLAN ID(or F flag sets to 0), the
      RESV field is 2 bits length, otherwise it is 6 bits.

   o  VLAN/FGL Data Label: This carries a 12-bits VLAN identifier or
      24-bits FGL Data Label that is valid for all subsequent MAC
      addresses in this TLV, or the value zero if no VLAN/FGL data label
      is specified.

   o  MAC(i): This is the 48-bit MAC address reachable in the Data Label
      given from the IS that is announcing this TLV.

5.  Data Packet Processing

   The subsections below specify Smart Endnode data packet processing.
   All TRILL data packets sent to or from Smart Endnodes are sent in the
   Designated VLAN [RFC6325] of the local link but do not necessarily
   have to be VLAN tagged.

5.1.  Data Packet Processing for Smart Endnode

   A Smart Endnode does not issue or receive LSPs or E-L1FS FS-LSPs or
   calculate topology.  It does the following:

   o  Smart Endnode maintains an endnode table of (the MAC address of
      remote endnode, Data Label, the nickname of the edge RBridge's
      attached) entries of end nodes with which the Smart Endnode is
      communicating.  Entries in this table are populated the same way
      that an edge RBridge populates the entries in its table:

      *  learning from (source MAC address ingress nickname) on packets
         it decapsulates.

      *  from ESADI[RFC7357].

      *  by querying a directory [RFC7067].

      *  by having some entries configured.

   o  When Smart Endnode SE1 wishes to transmit to unicast destination
      remote node D, if (address of remote endnode D, nickname)entry is
      in SE1's endnode table, SE1 encapsulates with ingress nickname=the
      nicknamae of the RBridge(RB1), egress nickname as indicated in D's
      table entry.  If D is unknown, D either queries a directory or
      encapsulates the packet as a multi-destination frame, using one of
      the trees that RB1 has specified in RB1's Smart-Hello.

   o  When SE1 wishes to transmit to a multicast or broadcast
      destination, SE1 encapsulates the packet using one of the trees
      that RB1 has specified.

   The Smart Endnode SE1 need not send Smart-Hellos as frequently as
   normal RBridges.  These Smart-Hellos could be periodically unicast to
   the Appointed Forwarder RB1 through native RBridge channel messages.
   In case RB1 crashes and restarts, or the DRB changes and SE1 receives
   the Smart-Hello without mentioning SE1, SE1 SHOULD send a Smart-Hello
   immediately.  If RB1 is AF for any of the VLANs that SE1 claims, RB1
   MUST list SE1 in its Smart-Hellos as a Smart Endnode neighbor.

5.2.  Data Packet Processing for Edge RBridge

   The attached edge RBridge processes and forwards the data frame based
   on the endnode property rather than for encapsulates and forwards the
   native frame as the traditional RBridges.  There are several
   situations for the edge RBridges:

   o  If receiving an encapsulated unicast data frame from a port with a
      smart endnode, with RB1's nickname as ingress, the edge RBridge
      RB1 forwards the frame to the specified egress nickname, as with
      any encapsulated frame.  However, RB1 MAY filter the encapsulation
      frame based on the inner source MAC and Data Label as specified
      for the Smart Endnode.  If the MAC (or Data Label) are not among
      the expected entries of the Smart Endnode, the frame would be
      dropped by the edge RBridge.

   o  If receiving an multi-destination TRILL Data packet from a port
      with a Smart Endnode, RBridge RB1 forwards the TRILL encapsulation
      to the TRILL campus based on the distribution tree.  If there are
      some normal endnodes (i.e, non-Smart Endnode) attached to the edge
      RBridge RB1, RB1 decapsulates the frame and sends the native frame
      to these ports possibly pruned based on multicast listeners, in
      addition to forwarding the multi-destination TRILL frame to the
      rest of the campus.

   o  When RB1 receives a multicast frame from a remote RBridge, and the
      exit port includes hybrid endnodes(Smart Endnodes and non-Smart
      Endnodes), it sends two copies of mulicast frames, one as native
      and the other as TRILL encapsulated frame.  When Smart Endnode
      receives the encapsulated frame, it learns the remote (MAC
      address, Data Label, Nickname) entry, A Smart Endnodes ignores
      native data frames.  A normal (non-smart) endnode receives the
      native frame and learns the remote MAC address and ignores the
      TRILL data packet.  This transit solution may bring some
      complexity for the edge RBridge and waste network bandwidth
      resource, so avoiding the hybrid endnodes scenario by attaching
      the Smart Endnodes and non-Smart Endnodes to different ports is
      RECOMMENDED.  Another solution is that if there are one or more
      endnodes on a link, the non-Smart Endnodes are ignored on a link;
      but we can configure a port to support mixed links.  If RB1 is
      configured that the link is "Smart Endnode only", then it will
      only send and receive TRILL-encapsulated frames on that link.  If
      it is configured to "non-smart-endnodes only" on a port, it will
      only send and receive native frames from that port.

6.  Multi-homing Scenario

   Multi-homing is a common scenario for the Smart Endnode.  The Smart
   Endnode is on a link attached to the TRILL domain in two places: to
   edge RBridge RB1 and RB2.  Take the figure below as example.  The
   Smart Endnode SE1 is attached to the TRILL domain by RB1 and RB2
   separately.  Both RB1 and RB2 could assign their nicknames to SE1.

                          Figure 5 Multi-homing Scenario


   There are several solutions for this scenario:

   (1)  Smart Endnode SE1 can choose either RB1 or RB2's nickname, when
        encapsulating a frame, whether the encapsulated frame is sent
        via RB1 or RB2.  If SE1 uses RB1's nickname, in this scenario,
        SE1 will encapsulate with TRILL source nickname RB1 when
        transmitting on either port.  This is simple, but means that all
        return traffic will be via RB1.  If Smart Endnode SE1 wants to
        do active-active load splitting, and uses RB1's nickname when
        forwarding through RB1, and RB2's nickname when forwarding
        through RB2, this will cause MAC flip-flopping of the endnode
        table entry in the remote RBridges (or Smart Endnodes).  One
        solution is to set a multi- homing bit in the RSV field of the
        TRILL data packet.  When remote RBridge RB3 or Smart Endnodes
        receives a data packet with the multi-homed bit set, the endnode
        entries (SE1's MAC addresslabel, RB1's nickname) and (SE1's MAC
        address, label, RB2's nickname) will coexist as endnode entries
        in the remote RBridge.  Another solution is to extend the ESADI
        protocol to distribute multiple attachments of a MAC address of
        a multi-homing group.  (Please refer to the option B in section
        4 of [I-D.ietf-trill-aa-multi-attach] for details).

   (2)  RB1 and RB2 might indicate, in their Smart-Hellos, a virtual
        nickname that attached end nodes may use if they are multihomed
        to RB1 and RB2, separate from RB1 and RB2's nicknames (which
        they would also list in their Smart-Hellos).  This would be
        useful if there were many end nodes multihomed to the same set
        of RBridges.  This would be analogous to a pseudonode nickname;
        return traffic would go via the shortest path from the source to
        the endnode, whether it is RB1 or RB2.  If Smart Endnode SE1
        loses connectivity to RB2, then SE1 would revert to using RB1's
        nickname.  In order to avoid RPF check issue for multi-

        destination frame, the affinity TLV [I-D.ietf-trill-cmt] is
        recommended to be used in this solution.

7.  Security Considerations

   Smart-Hellos can be secured by using Authentication TLVs based on
   [RFC5310].

   For general TRILL Security Considerations, see [RFC6325].

   For native RBridge channel Security Considerations, see [RFC7178].

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate an RBridge Channel Protocol number
   (0x005) to indicate a smart-hello frame.

   IANA is requested to allocate APPsub-TLV type numbers for the Smart-
   MAC and Smart-Parameters APPsub-TLVs.
