INTERNET-DRAFT               IOTP v1 Errata                     May 2001


1. Introduction

   The Internet Open Trading Protcol (IOTP), Version 1.0, is specified
   in [RFC 2801, 2802, 2803]. It provides a payment system independent
   framework for Internet commerce oriented to consumer to business
   transactions. It provides mechaism for different portions of the the
   business function, such as fullfilment or payment handling, to be
   distributed or outsourced. It does not require a prior relationship
   between the consumer and business.

   Several errors have been noted in the IOTP v1.0 specification,
   particularly RFC 2801, which was the largest RFC even issued. These
   are listed, with their fix, in this document.



2. DTD Errata



2.1 PackagedContent Element

   Attribute types are swapped.

   OLD/INCORRECT:
      !ELEMENT PackagedContent (#PCDATA) >
      <!ATTLIST PackagedContent
               Name             CDATA     #IMPLIED
               Content          NMTOKEN   "PCDATA"
               Transform   (NONE|BASE64)  "NONE" >

   NEW/CORRECT:
      <!ELEMENT PackagedContent (#PCDATA) >
      <!ATTLIST PackagedContent
                Name           NMTOKEN     #IMPLIED
                Content        CDATA       "PCDATA"
                Transform   (NONE|BASE64)  "NONE" >



2.2 The Element called Attribute

   Incorrect element content specification syntax.

   OLD/INCORRECT:
      <!ELEMENT Attribute ( ANY ) >
      <!ATTLIST Attribute
                type                NMTOKEN            #REQUIRED
                critical        ( true | false )       #REQUIRED
      >

INTERNET-DRAFT               IOTP v1 Errata                     May 2001


   NEW/CORRECT
      <!ELEMENT Attribute ANY >
      <!ATTLIST Attribute
                type                NMTOKEN            #REQUIRED
                critical        ( true | false )       #REQUIRED
      >



3. Other Errata



3.1 Re: Combining Authentication Transactions with other Transactions

   Section 9.1.13. page 234, restarted->continued:

   OLD/INCORRECT:
         if the Authentication transaction is successful, then the
         original IOTP Transaction is restarted

   NEW/CORRECT:
         if the Authentication transaction is successful, then the
         original IOTP Transaction is continued



3.2 Type attribute of Element called Attribute

   Section 7.19.1, Page 150, insufficient list of signature types:

   OLD/INCORRECT:
         There must be one and only one Attribute Element that contains
         a Type attribute with a value of IOTP Signature Type and with
         content set to either: OfferResponse, PaymentResponse,
         DeliveryResponse, AuthenticationRequest,
         AuthenticationResponse, PingReq or PingResponse; depending on
         the type of the signature.

   NEW/CORRECT:
         There must be one and only one Attribute Element that contains
         a Type attribute with a value of IOTP Signature Type and with
         content set to either: OfferResponse, PaymentResponse,
         DeliveryResponse, AuthenticationRequest,
         AuthenticationResponse, PingReq, PingResponse,
         AuthenticationStatus, InquiryRequest, or InquiryResponse;
         depending on the type of the signature.

   AND a similar change exending the list of values in Section 12.1,
   Page 262.

INTERNET-DRAFT               IOTP v1 Errata                     May 2001


   And at Section 6.1.2, Page 82, add the following:

      AuthenticationStatus       any role

      InquiryRequest             any role

      InquiryResponse            any role



4. Security Considerations

   The errata listed herein are not particularly security related. Never
   the less, incorrect implementations due to uncorrected errors in the
   specification may compromise security.
