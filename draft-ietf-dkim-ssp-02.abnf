dkim=  Outbound signing practices for the domain (plain-text;
      REQUIRED).  Possible values are as follows:

      unknown  The domain may sign none, some, or all email.

      all  All mail from the domain is signed with an Author Signature.

      discardable  All mail from the domain is signed with an Author
         Signature.  Furthermore, if a message arrives without a valid
         Author Signature due to modification in transit, submission via
         a path without access to a signing key, or other reason, the
         domain encourages the recipient(s) to discard it.

         NON-NORMATIVE DISCUSSION:  Sender signing practices of
         "discardable" would be usually inappropriate for domains of end
         users, because of the potential for mailing lists and similar
         agents to modify messages in such a way as to render the
         signature invalid.  Domains sending mail that is expected to
         pass with no significant modification to the recipient, such as
         domains sending only transactional messages, are appropriate
         places to consider the publication of a "discardable" practice.
         See [RFC5016] section 5.3 and Appendix A for further
         discussion.

      ABNF:


ssp-dkim-tag   = "dkim" *WSP "=" *WSP ("unknown" /
                     "all" / "discardable")

t= Flags, represented as a colon-separated list of names (plain-text;
      OPTIONAL, default is that no flags are set).  Flag values are:

      s  The signing practices apply only to the named domain, and not
         to subdomains.

      ABNF:


ssp-t-tag       = %x75 *WSP "=" *WSP ssp-t-tag-flag
                     0*( *WSP ":" *WSP ssp-t-tag-flag )
ssp-t-tag-flag  = "s" / hyphenated-word
                           ; for future extension
hyphenated-word = ALPHA [ *(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
                     (ALPHA / DIGIT) ]
      Unrecognized flags MUST be included in the result that is provided
      to the Evaluator.
