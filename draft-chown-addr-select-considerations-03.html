<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
Where the source and/or destination node of an IPv6 communication
is multi-addressed, a mechanism is required for the initiating node
to select the most appropriate address pair for the communication.
RFC 3484 (IPv6 Default Address Selection) <a class='info' href='#RFC3484'>[RFC3484]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Draves, R., &ldquo;Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>
defines such a mechanism for nodes to perform source and destination
address selection.   While RFC3484 recognised the need for 
implementations to be able to change the policy table, it did not define
how this could be achieved.  Requirements have now emerged for 
administrators to be able to dynamically change the RFC 3484 policy tables 
from a central control point, and for nomadic hosts to be able to 
obtain the policy for the network that they are currently attached 
to without manual user intervention.  This text discusses considerations 
for such policy changes, including examples of cases where a change 
of policy is required, and the likely frequency of such policy changes.   
This text also includes some discussion on the need to also update RFC 
3484, where default policies are currently defined.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
There have been various operational issues observed with Default 
Address Selection for IPv6 (RFC 3484) <a class='info' href='#RFC3484'>[RFC3484]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Draves, R., &ldquo;Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>, 
as described in RFC 5220 <a class='info' href='#RFC5220'>[RFC5220]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Matsumoto, A., Fujisaki, T., Hiromi, R., and K. Kanayama, &ldquo;Problem Statement for Default Address Selection in Multi-Prefix Environments: Operational Issues of RFC 3484 Default Rules,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.  
As as a result, there has been some demand for hosts to be able to 
have their policy tables, and potentially the rules described in RFC
3484, modified dynamically.   
Such changes may apply to 'static' hosts in a network where policies or
topologies change, or nomadic hosts within a network for which policies
may vary depending on their location within the network.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Issues to Consider</h3>

<p>
There are a number of aspects to consider in the context of such address
selection policy updates.   
	
</p>
<p>
First is the frequency for which such updates
are likely to be required; this can be determined largely from identifying
the scenarios in which policy changes will be required.  This may include
overriding default operating system policies on startup, as well as 
changes while a system is running.  We discuss this topic in Section 4.
	
</p>
<p>
Second, by understanding how dynamic the policy update mechanism needs to be
we should be better placed to determine what types of update approaches best
meet those needs.   There may be other considerations of course, e.g. 
whether the systems are in managed or unmanaged environments, and whether
the solution should be proactive or automated, as discussed in
<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-sol'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;6man&#8209;addr&#8209;select&#8209;sol]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Matsumoto, A., Fujisaki, T., and R. Hiromi, &ldquo;Solution approaches for address-selection problems,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>.    Section 5 covers
these issues.
	
</p>
<p>
Third, if we assume some policy update mechanism is defined we should 
consider how hosts and systems may become aware that a policy change has 
happened, and how policy can be disseminated in a timely fashion.
Thus we need to understand what kind of triggers can be identified that 
can be used for invoking the policy table update mechanism, e.g. address 
re-obtainment, address lifetime expiration, or perhaps policy lifetime 
expiration.   We also need to consider what other factors may come
into play, e.g. potential policy conflicts.  This is discussed in Section 6.
	
</p>
<p>
After analysing these issues, we can make some initial comments regarding
the potential solution spaces, and what models may be well suited, e.g.
push vs pull models, and what other methods might assist us, e.g. hints
from local routing tables.   This is covered in Section 7.
	
</p>
<p>
Finally, we should assess whether these
update solutions require or need RFC 3484 to be updated.  In some
instances, we might envision solutions that simply use RFC 3484 as 
guidelines and provide sufficient controls to address the current 
limitations in the RFC.   However, as noted in RFC 5220
<a class='info' href='#RFC5220'>[RFC5220]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Matsumoto, A., Fujisaki, T., Hiromi, R., and K. Kanayama, &ldquo;Problem Statement for Default Address Selection in Multi-Prefix Environments: Operational Issues of RFC 3484 Default Rules,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, not all the operational issues observed to
date can be remedied by updating RFC 3484 alone.
There is already a good analysis of issues with RFC 3484 and how the
text could be revised
<a class='info' href='#I-D.arifumi-6man-rfc3484-revise'>[I&#8209;D.arifumi&#8209;6man&#8209;rfc3484&#8209;revise]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Matsumoto, A., Fujisaki, T., and R. Hiromi, &ldquo;Things To Be Considered for RFC 3484 Revision,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>).

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Other Related Work</h3>

<p>
We note that there is some existing work in defining Requirements for
Address Selection Mechanisms
<a class='info' href='#RFC5221'>[RFC5221]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Matsumoto, A., Fujisaki, T., Hiromi, R., and K. Kanayama, &ldquo;Requirements for Address Selection Mechanisms,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>,
and some initial work has been done in the solution space (for a DHCP-based
method) <a class='info' href='#I-D.fujisaki-dhc-addr-select-opt'>[I&#8209;D.fujisaki&#8209;dhc&#8209;addr&#8209;select&#8209;opt]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fujisaki, T., Matsumoto, A., and R. Hiromi, &ldquo;Distributing Address Selection Policy using DHCPv6,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>, but these are not
discussed here.   While RFC 5221 assumes that a dynamic policy update
mechanism of some form is available, this draft is primarily aimed at
understanding the scenarios and triggers for policy changes, to better
inform future detailed solution discussions.

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;
Drivers for Policy Changes</h3>

<p>
If we wish to determine how frequent address selection policy changes are 
likely to be, we need to understand why such policies might need to be
changed, for particular sites or networks.
	
</p>
<p>
One reference text for potential drivers for policy change
is RFC 5220, in which operational issues with the existing policies described
in RFC 3484 are listed.   Each subsection of this document gives a reason
why the existing rules or policy tables in RFC 3484 may not be sufficient
in certain cases.
There have been some significant changes to IPv6 since RFC 3484 was drafted
which have impacted the RFC, e.g.
the introduction of Unique Local Addresses (ULAs), and concerns about the
impact of using 
longest prefix matching on (DNS) round-robin load balancing.
	
</p>
<p>
In summary, the issues raised in RFC 5220 were:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Multiple Routers on a Single Interface
</li>
<li>Ingress Filtering
</li>
<li>Half-Closed Network Problem (*)
</li>
<li>Combined Use of Global and ULA addresses (*)
</li>
<li>Site Renumbering (*)
</li>
<li>Multicast Source Address Selection (*)
</li>
<li>Temporary Address Selection
</li>
<li>IPv4 or IPv6 Prioritization (*)
</li>
<li>ULA and IPv4 Dual-Stack Environment (*)
</li>
<li>ULA or Global Prioritization (*)
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p>
The authors of RFC 5220 noted which of these issues can be solved just by 
changes to the RFC 3484 policy table, marked (*) above, and which cannot.  
It is interesting to note that issues largely related to internal 
networking and (administrative) policy decisions can be handled this way.
However some issues need changes beyond just policy table updates.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.&nbsp;
Internal vs External Triggers</h3>

<p>
When considering drivers or triggers that may lead to a requirement for
the policy to change, we can divide the problem space into those drivers
that are external to a site or network and those internal to it.     
In the case of the first two examples above, 
a dynamic policy table update may be required by externally driven
routing changes, assuming the site uses a dynamic routing protocol
intra-site and the routing protocol is configured to reflect changes
of extra-site routing topology.   
	
</p>
<p>
If a site is multihomed using BGP and advertising a single prefix upstream,
then no policy table manipulation is required for global address preferences.
However where a site is multihomed by receiving a prefix from each upstream
provider, each host will have multiple addresses and many need policy
table manipulation.
In such a case, the policy table of hosts may need to be updated
according to the routing policy.   
	
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that we have other mechanisms for dynamic routing
topology change, for example deprecating one of the advertised prefixes,
e.g. when one of the upstream links has a problem.   But such mechanisms
may only help in some cases, and do not remove the need for agility in 
the RFC 3484 policy.
	
</p>
<p>
Other examples of external factors include a new transition mechanism
being defined (e.g. as with the emergence of Teredo using 2001::/32
as assigned by IANA) and its inclusion being required in the policy table
(at the time of writing Teredo is not included in RFC 3484, though some
operating systems have added it), a new address block being defined,
or a site renumbering event that could be triggered by an upstream 
provider's actions.

Administratively Triggered Changes</h3>

<p>
The other examples above are, in the general case, where the
site administrator chooses to change a local policy and in doing so 
triggers the need for policy table updates.   Some of these
changes one might assume to be set once, and to change rarely, 
for example:
	
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Setting priority use of IPv6 over IPv4 (or vice versa).
</li>
<li> Setting priority use of ULAs over globals (or vice versa).
</li>
<li> Setting priority use of privacy addresses over DNS-published globals (or vice versa).
</li>
<li> An internal network renumbering occurs, perhaps due to a site expanding.
</li>
<li> The nature of the external connectivity through multiple ISPs requires 
specific additional information (policy) to be delivered to certain hosts
(as discussed in 2.1.3 in RFC 5220).
</li>
<li> Disabling longest-prefix match functions to facilitate round-robin load
balancing.
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p>
However it may be the case that different parts of a site have different
policies, or policies are changed in a rolling fashion across a site over
time as IPv6 and/or ULAs are introduced (for example).   This may happen
where the administrator prefers a gradual introduction of new policy in
a phased operation across a site, rather than changing policy across the
whole site in one operation.
	
</p>
<p>
Other administrative changes may occur more frequently, e.g.:
	
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Routing tables and forwarding tables change dynamically.
</li>
<li> A different provider (link) is preferred for a given destination.
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p>
It's possible that provider links may vary on a daily basis, or by time
of day.   The frequency of such policy changes will depend on the frequency
that the administrator wishes to change the implied 
traffic engineering policies.

Start-up vs Running Changes</h3>

<p>
When a host starts up it may be configured with the default RFC 3484 policies.
At this stage a number of addresses may be configured on a number of interfaces
on the host.   At this time it may be desirable for the host to be able
to receive the site-specific policy updates as a start-up override from
the RFC 3484 defaults.
	
</p>
<p>
Other policy changes may later be required while the host is running.   Ideally
the same protocol should be used for the start-up and running state update
mechanism.

Nomadic Nodes</h3>

<p>
A host may be nomadic within a site and as a result it may see
the preferred policy change
depending on the host's topological location within that site.   Such a host
should be capable of receiving policy updates in a timely fashion as it
migrates within the network.    
	
</p>
<p>
While this may be one case of 'running changes'
described above, the policy changes are required due to the host's new point
of attachment, not changes of policy to the current point of attachment.
The frequency of updates are thus depend ant on the frequency of host 
mobility to parts of the network that have differing policies.

<a name="rfc.section.4.5"></a><h3>4.5.&nbsp;
Multiple Interface Nodes</h3>

<p>
In considering scenarios where hosts may be multi-addressed and require
policy to assist in address selection, the issue of hosts with 
multiple interfaces arises.
	
</p>
<p>
A host may have a variety of reasons to have multiple interfaces.  It may
for example have WiFi and 3G interfaces, and be capable of sending or
receiving data over either interface.   In some cases these interfaces
may fall within the same administrative domain (ISP) and in some cases
they may not.   Another example would be the case of a host with a
VPN connection established, where address selection may be affected by the
choice of whether the VPN connection is used or not.
	
</p>
<p>
This is clearly an important problem today, but we note that RFC 3484 is
currently
defined as a per-node, not per-interface, mechanism.  However, for 
RFC 3484, and its potential update mechanisms, to be applicable to typical
'real world' usage patterns, we should consider the multiple interface
scenarios.
	
</p>
<p>
In the case where a host has multiple interfaces there are two likely
scenarios:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Wired and wireless interfaces - in this case the operating system
just needs to pick one interface and use it.
</li>
<li>Normal and VPN interfaces - here the default should be the normal
interface; the VPN interface should only be used for destinations
associated with the VPN.
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p>
It has been suggested that an RFC 3484 policy table is required on
a per-interface basis, though the choice of interface may itself be
determined by the (destination) address selection process.   As stated 
above, RFC 3484's policy table is currently defined to be node-wide.   
The node-wide problem is destination address selection when the source 
address is implied from a selected interface.
	
</p>
<p>
We note that there are some new, initial drafts published recently on the 
multiple interface problem
<a class='info' href='#I-D.blanchet-mif-problem-statement'>[I&#8209;D.blanchet&#8209;mif&#8209;problem&#8209;statement]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Blanchet, M. and P. Seite, &ldquo;Multiple Interfaces Problem Statement,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>,

These drafts fall within the remit of the new IETF mif WG, which at the
time of writing was only recently formed.   We note that the mif WG may 
produce relevant work with respect to the analysis of RFC 3484 policy
changes, but at this stage no such output exists for inclusion.

<a name="rfc.section.5"></a><h3>5.&nbsp;
How Dynamic?</h3>

<p>
The discussion above suggests that many of the potential triggers for
policy table changes are 'one-off' in nature, i.e. a site makes a one-time
policy change.   It is thus unlikely that such administrative changes will
be frequent.
	
</p>
<p>
There are some cases where updates may be required to be 
more frequent.   In the example of a site which is implementing the 
gradual introduction of new policy across its network, while the frequency
of changes may be relatively high, there is still probably only one or a
small number of changes per host.   
	
</p>
<p>
There may be a higher rate of policy changes within a site if there are
nomadic hosts within the site, and these are roaming frequently to
parts of the network where differing policies are in effect.   In such
cases it may be useful for a host to know whether or not the default
RFC 3484 (or soon to be 3484bis) policies are in effect or not, and for
there to be a 'cheap' way for the host to discover this.
	
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the biggest cause of policy change lies where the preferred links 
or paths for certain destinations change frequently
over time as (typically) traffic engineering requirements change.   
In some networks this may be a daily change, or change between states at 
different times of day.  It is not clear 
how common these cases are, and thus further input is welcomed here.
Our belief is that cases where dynamic changes are used heavily are rare.
	
</p>
<p>
So, unless a site or network has rapidly changing traffic engineering 
requirements, or includes a high number of mobile nodes where the nodes
are roaming to areas of the network with differing address selection
related policies, the frequency of updates is likely to be relatively
low.   Most update requests will simply occur when a host starts up,
and such requests for policy will be little different in frequency to
other configuration requests.   Other types of network change that
may require a host to change its RFC 3484 policy behaviour are probably
also likely to have associated changes with other host configuration data.

Considerations when Obtaining Policy</h3>

<p>
When a policy change is made, or a host migrates to a part of the
network with different policies, that change of policy needs to
be conveyed to the host.  It needs to be made available and 
applied without restarting every affected host.
	
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.6.1"></a><h3>6.1.&nbsp;
Changes in Available Address(es)</h3>

<p>
One might assume at first that when a host observes
a change in its addresses, it should re-obtain the selection policy,
but this may not always be the case.  Not all policy changes are tied 
to a host changing one or more addresses, though it may be acceptable
to query regardless for new policy (if a pull model is used) when 
address information changes.
	
</p>
<p>
As described above, it may be sufficient for a host to know when
a policy is changed, or that perhaps the default policy is - or is
not - in effect in its current locale.
	
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.6.2"></a><h3>6.2.&nbsp;
Timeliness</h3>

<p>
In many, but not all, cases a policy change will need to be synchronised 
across a network.  Thus there is a general issue of timely and 
synchronised dissemination of new policy.
If the policy is distributed via the same mechanism that informs a
host of a change of address(es), the application of the policy should
be synchronised sufficiently with the address change.   However, 
not all hosts may receive the update information at the same time, e.g.
where new address assignments may be dependent on DHCP lease timers.
	
</p>
<p>
Where hosts use DHCPv6 for address information, in the absence of some
form of Reconfigure message, a host may see a delay in policy changes
being notified.   One possible tool to help here is the DHCPv6
Lifetime Option (RFC4242)
<a class='info' href='#RFC4242'>[RFC4242]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Venaas, S., Chown, T., and B. Volz, &ldquo;Information Refresh Time Option for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>, which was originally introduced to assist
with network renumbering events.

<a name="rfc.section.6.3"></a><h3>6.3.&nbsp;
Manual Configuration?</h3>

<p>
There are scenarios where a host may wish to ignore conveyed policy.
For example, the manager of a mobile node may not want to have its 
preferences changed by a visited network.  In such a case one might 
argue that the mobile node should use MIPv6 with whatever its home 
network policies are.  
	
</p>
<p>
The implication again is that there could be value in having a flag of 
some kind to inform a host whether network it is in uses the default 
RFC 3484 policy, which would then allow each end system to decide if 
it should get an (overriding) local policy or not.   One problem with
this though is that some operating systems already implement 'modified'
RFC 3484 behaviour, so we would have to be sure that all nodes have
common understanding of what the 'default' is (in principle, that all 
nodes implement any future revised RFC 3484 default policy table).

Policy Conflicts</h3>

<p>
In the case of a host operating in a single administrative domain, 
consistent policy should be available from whichever policy distribution
mechanism provides the information.
However, in scenarios where a host is multi-addressed from
multiple providers (e.g. a SOHO network with differing DSL and cable 
providers) there is likely to be some conflicts in the received RFC 
3484 policy information.    For the policy update mechanism to be
applicable in the general case, we need to include potential policy
conflicts from such scenarios.   An initial draft on handling such
policy conflicts has been released
<a class='info' href='#I-D.arifumi-6man-addr-select-conflict'>[I&#8209;D.arifumi&#8209;6man&#8209;addr&#8209;select&#8209;conflict]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Matsumoto, A., Fujisaki, T., and R.

Is default policy used?</h3>

<p>
There could be some mechanism to indicate to a host that the local network
has a modified RFC 3484 policy in use, and thus that a revised policy table 
is available (and should be used).   Alternatively a host could simply
attempt to obtain local RFC 3484 policy on startup regardless.   Regardless,
it should also be possible for a host to detect that policy has changed 
(whether 'around' the host, or due to the host being nomadic).   
	
</p>
<p>	
It is assumed by 'default' policy here we refer to the revised/updated 
RFC3484 specification, when that is produced.   The question as to how
a non-default policy is indicated may be steered by which we believe to be
the common case in the longer term - hosts that need local policy changes, 
or hosts that do not.   If an RA bit is used to indicate whether a local
policy is available, we avoid hosts requesting potentially non-existent
policy tables (or copies of default tables they already have) forever.

<a name="rfc.section.7.2"></a><h3>7.2.&nbsp;
Pull model</h3>

<p>
One potential solution is that a host uses a similar mechanism for
RFC 3484 policy updates as is used for obtaining other configuration
data, for example DHCPv6 <a class='info' href='#RFC3315'>[RFC3315]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Droms, R., Bound, J., Volz, B., Lemon, T., Perkins, C., and M. Carney, &ldquo;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>.   For hosts using 
stateless autoconfiguration, policy could be available via stateless 
DHCPv6 <a class='info' href='#RFC3736'>[RFC3736]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Droms, R., &ldquo;Stateless Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Service for IPv6,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>.   
	
</p>
<p>
There are also already some initial proposals from the IETF mif WG on
using DHCPv6 to deliver (mainly routing oriented) information to hosts,
e.g.  <a class='info' href='#I-D.sun-mif-route-config-dhcp6'>[I&#8209;D.sun&#8209;mif&#8209;route&#8209;config&#8209;dhcp6]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sun, T. and H.

<a class='info' href='#I-D.sun-mif-address-policy-dhcp6'>[I&#8209;D.sun&#8209;mif&#8209;address&#8209;policy&#8209;dhcp6]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sun, T., Deng, H., and X.

Seite, &ldquo;DHCPv6 Extension for Configuring Hosts with Multiple Interfaces,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.   These methods
assume entities that have timely knowledge of routing information can
provide equally timely hints to hosts on address selection, via DHCPv6.
At this stage we believe that distributing RFC 3484 policy, as 
configured by an administrator, is a more practical use of DHCPv6.
If future methods offer additional 'hints' based on routing information,
this becomes part of the 'policy conflict' problem to be solved.
	
</p>
<p>
The DHCP model allows individual nodes to potentially have differing 
policy, even when on the same subnet.

Push model</h3>

<p>
For hosts only using stateless
autoconfiguration, in environments without DHCPv6, it can be argued that
since the network is not managed, there is not likely to be any 'managed'
policy to push to the hosts.   In such environments hosts may perhaps
more usefully use techniques such as router hints to make informed
selections, as discussed later in this text.
	
</p>
<p>
It may of course be possible to piggy back policy information to a host 
in a Router Advertisement message, though initial
consensus seems to be that this is a less attractive approach.   However,
we may find that RAs may be a good place to indicate whether a default 
policy is in place or not, to avoid hosts requesting non-existent updates
via DHCPv6.

Routing Hints</h3>

<p>
As mentioned above, if a host has routing hints available, it may be able 
to make more informed selections.  For example,  a protocol could be 
specified for a node to query an on-link or remote (e.g. edge) router 
for 'hints'.   Having hosts themselves participate in routing is generally
not desirable.  At this stage we can simply note that address selection 
might be simplified when some hint based on routing state is provided to 
the end system, but such mechanisms are out of scope for this text.
	
</p>
<p>
It is noted in <a class='info' href='#I-D.carpenter-renum-needs-work'>[I&#8209;D.carpenter&#8209;renum&#8209;needs&#8209;work]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Carpenter, B., Atkinson, R., and H. Flinck, &ldquo;Renumbering still needs work,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>
that:
	
</p>
<p>
"In an environment where a site has more than one upstream link to the
outside world, the site might have more than one valid routing
   prefix.  In such cases, typically all valid routing prefixes within a
   site will have the same prefix length.  Also in such cases, it might
   be desirable for hosts that obtain their addresses using DHCPv6 to
   learn about the availability of upstream links dynamically, by
   deducing from periodic IPv6 RA messages which routing prefixes are
   currently valid.  This application seems possible within the IPv6
   Neighbour Discovery architecture, but does not appear to be clearly
   specified anywhere."
	
</p>
<p>
The same thought seems relevant to address selection. There's no
point selecting a source address whose prefix is not being advertised
in RAs.
	
</p>
<p>
While routing and prefix hints may help a host make selection decisions,
we should consider to what extent we wish to 'burden' a host with 
holding such information.

Conflicts/Merging Policies</h3>

<p>
For whatever mechanism is used to distribute RFC 3484 policy,
it is not yet clear whether entire policy tables will be made available,
or simply differences to the 'default', and thus whether policies may
need to be merged, or overridden.   Some policy conflicts will be 
unresolvable, e.g. one prefers IPv4 over IPv6, the other vice-versa.
It may be simpler, though less efficient, for whole policy tables to 
be distributed, to avoid the merger problem.  
	
</p>
<p>
One option may be to split the policy table into destination address
selection and source address selection tables, with the policy
distribution only updating the source address selection.   Whether this
might make merging policies simpler or in fact more complex would
require further study.
	
</p>
<p>
It may also be possible to indicate some priority value for a policy, e.g.
the priority of the interface it is received on.   Or if there are
multiple policies in conflict, a host could simply choose to fall back
to use the default RFC 3484 policy.
	
</p>
<p> 
A host also needs to know how to decide when to accept a policy.  We could
simplify the discussion by assuming a host is located in and only nomadic
within a single site with one administrative controlling entity.

On RFC3484 Default Policies</h3>

<p>
RFC 3484 includes text about mechanisms for changing policy, having 'policy
hooks' and having a configurable policy table.   The implication is
that defaults can be changed, and the text gives examples of this in 
Section 10.   However, issues with RFC 3484 are broader that just policy
table updates - it remains the case that
some operational issues with RFC 3484 are not just related to the table,
but on rules themselves, e.g. longest prefix match (affecting DNS round
robin as described in <a class='info' href='#RFC5220'>[RFC5220]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Matsumoto, A., Fujisaki, T., Hiromi, R., and K. Kanayama, &ldquo;Problem Statement for Default Address Selection in Multi-Prefix Environments: Operational Issues of RFC 3484 Default Rules,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>).  
	
</p>
<p>
While discussing default policy, we noted that the word 'default' has to 
be carefully defined,  and also what the scope of this 'default' is.
The default policy should be whatever RFC 3484, or its -bis version,
states.   At present some operating systems have already modified their
default, based on operational feedback (e.g. on ULAs, on Teredo prefixes,
or on the DNS round-robin problem).  Currently we assume RFC3484 and 
changes to it will remain node-specific.
	
</p>
<p>
It certainly seems the case that the issues raised in RFC 5220, and
discussed in <a class='info' href='#I-D.arifumi-6man-rfc3484-revise'>[I&#8209;D.arifumi&#8209;6man&#8209;rfc3484&#8209;revise]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Matsumoto, A., Fujisaki, T., and R. Hiromi, &ldquo;Things To Be Considered for RFC 3484 Revision,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> mean
that an update of RFC 3484 is required, if only because some of the issues 
(as highlighted earlier) cannot be addressed by updating the policy
table alone.   An update would also give us some hope that all operating
systems might have a common 'default'.
	
</p>
<p>
We do not note any specific comments here on how RFC 3484 should be updated.
Other drafts have made suggestions.   There are some discussions
on ideas however, e.g. on the semantics of labels, and in adding ULAs
explicitly to the default policy table.   
	
</p>
<p>
There have also been new
issues identified, e.g. on how one differentiates between IPv4+NAT access
or IPv6 transitional access (e.g. via Teredo) to a dual-stack destination
(the IPv4 private address inside the NAT is implicitly global, although its 
explicit scope is local) <a class='info' href='#I-D.denis-v6ops-nat-addrsel'>[I&#8209;D.denis&#8209;v6ops&#8209;nat&#8209;addrsel]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Denis-Courmont, R., &ldquo;Problems with IPv6 source address selection and IPv4 NATs,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
This illustrates that new issues may continue to be identified through
growing IPv6 operational experience.
	
</p>
<p>
It is hard to predict exactly what features people will want to add to
address selection algorithms in the future.  Ideally we should not
preclude future flexibility.   It seems clear that any RFC 3484 update
has two aspects: one that uses the existing policy table capability,
and one that might change associated algorithms.

Conclusions</h3>

<p>
We believe the general scope of this text applies to site and enterprise
networks, where an administrator may need to change policies over time, 
but that it includes nomadic nodes within the site, which may migrate 
to different parts of the site where different policies are required.    
However, we do not preclude other environments which might, in particular,
introduce (partially or more) conflicting policies from different 
administrative domains, e.g. in the SOHO space.   We include multiple
interface nodes in the discussion, and note there are two general cases,
namely wired/air (or wlan/3G) interface, and normal/VPN interfaces,
for which different solutions are likely to apply.
	
</p>
<p>
There is clearly a need to revise RFC 3484, to create a new default policy 
table for address selection, and to improve non policy table algorithms.  
This should be expedited.   We also note that RFC 3484
is currently defined on a per-node, not per-interface basis, which we
believe should remain the status quo for the scope of this work.   The
node-wide problem is destination address selection.
	
</p>
<p>
The scope of this text includes issues affecting the design of a protocol 
to allow a host's RFC 3484 policy table to be updated.   From discussion
of update triggers/scenarios, we believe rapid updates are unlikely 
unless a node is in a network which has (very) dynamic external traffic
engineering, or many nodes are mobile between parts of the network with
differing policy.   It's thus probably appropriate to use a similar method
to obtain RFC 3484 policy as to obtain other configuration data.
	
</p>
<p>
Hosts may receive conflicting policy updates in some cases, particularly
where they receive information from different administrative domains; some
initial work in analysing the conflict scenarios is underway.
	
</p>
<p>
In terms of push or pull-based methods for policy distribution, our
discussions suggest that a push-based hint to hosts as to whether they 
are in a network where a (non default) local policy applies or not 
could be useful.   This might be indicated via a RA option.
In terms of obtaining policy, a pull-based solution, such as DHCPv6,
may be appropriate in managed environments (where managed non-default
policies are most likely to be in effect).   DHCPv6 is also
preferable if individual hosts on a subnet require different policies.
