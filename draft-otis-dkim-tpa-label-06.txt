                  DKIM Third-Party Authorization Label
                      draft-otis-dkim-tpa-label-06

Abstract

   A third party authorization label (TPA-Label) is a DNS-based
   extension for DKIM ADSP records that allows domains in the From
   header field to authorize acceptable third-party signatures.  This
   approach allows autonomous and unilateral authorizations for third-
   party domains using scalable, individual DNS transactions.  The
   extended scope of DKIM signing practice assertions introduced here
   supplants transparent authorization schemes that are more difficult
   to administer.  Alternatives for facilitating third-party
   authorizations currently necessitate coordination between two or more
   domains to synchronously set up selector/key DNS records, DNS zone
   delegations, and/or a regular exchange of public/private keys.

   Checking TPA-Label Resource Records for signing practices might occur
   infrequently when a message is not compliant with restrictive ADSP
   practices, where an Author Domain Signature is either missing or
   invalid.  When a third-party signature is found, TPA-Label Resource
   Record transactions offer an efficient means for Author Domains to
   authorize specific third-party signing domains.  Recipients are
   afforded a method to determine whether authorization exists in
   situations where other modes of authorization are impractical.  TPA-
   Label Resource Records permit Author Domains a means to influence
   message handling selectively, for messages otherwise lacking valid
   Author Domain signatures.

Internet-Draft                  TPA-Label                    August 2010


1.  Introduction

   A transparent method for DKIM authorization requires the sharing of a
   number of details between the domain owner, and one or more providers
   of email and DNS.  Transparent authorization occurs when an Author
   Domain's DNS resolves a public DKIM key, with the corresponding
   private key being held by a third-party.  With the many ways in which
   this might be achieved, it is unlikely that standardized formats will
   be developed to exchange necessary, and at times, sensitive
   information between various informal third-party services, such as
   mailing-lists.  With transparent authorizations, when a security
   breach does occur, the wrong party might be held accountable for
   content it never saw nor logged.  For informal authorizations, the
   TPA-Label Resource Record supports a simple authorization method that
   keeps visible which administrative entity signed a message, and
   whether an Author Domain authorized the signature.  The authorization
   record may also impose additional header field requirements to better
   ensure protective message sorting.

   Tens of thousands of domains of various financial institutions are
   frequently being phished.  Phishing creates a nuisance for those who
   aren't expecting these messages, and a threat for those who then
   interact with them.  Whenever institutions employ DKIM and wish to
   utilize various informal third-party services, the integrity of their
   Author Domain Signatures might be affected.  Some respond to this by
   implementing less stringent Author Domain Signing Practices on
   subdomains to accommodate the impact of these third-party services,
   as suggested by [I-D.ietf-dkim-mailinglists] Section 4.1, that
   recommends use of subdomains to assert less restrictive ADSP
   practices.

   As currently structured, ADSP does not offer an alternative to using
   more domains, where only some are protected by a restrictive
   practice.  As such, it lacks a method to retain an authentication &
   authorization as an acceptance condition when using informal third
   party services.  Loss of authentication will lead to an increase of
   those being deceived by phishing attempts.  This is because people
   often do not understand the significance of URI hierarchy, and become
   confused or insensitive to domain changes.  APWG phishing trends,
   [apwg-globalphishingsurvey-2H2009] page 18, indicates phishing
   commonly uses subdomains in a URL to fool potential victims.

   Deterrents based upon reputation and/or path based strategies that
   utilize a variety of originating header fields are ineffective.
   These header fields often remain invisible to recipients, and contain
   domains being exploited for periods measured in hours, in an
   avoidance of any Whack-A-Mole like response.  Even long term
   reputations are increasingly problematic due to an intermix of

   messages from compromised accounts.  Few recipients will inspect the
   stack of message header fields, or be able to draw useful conclusions
   from a profusion of unfriendly information.  However, many recipients
   deal with abuse by sorting messages into groups based upon an assumed
   source found in a few originating header fields.

   ADSP represents an open registry that offers domain specific guidance
   for DKIM acceptance criteria when determining whether messages should
   be delivered, refused, or discarded.  However, appropriate actions
   become unclear whenever third-party services are involved.  For
   example, it is not clear whether ADSP "dkim=all" assertions include
   third-party services that could potentially damage Author-Domain
   signatures.  Although ADSP warns of a potential for disruption,
   specific handling recommendations are limited to "dkim=discardable".
   Administrative domains that assert all of their outbound messages are
   signed offer significant forensic value.  However, the handling for
   their messages lacking an Author Domain Signature with an ADSP
   "dkim=all" assertion remains unclear.

   This document describes how any Author Domain publishing ADSP records
   defined in [RFC5617] can autonomously authorize DKIM signatures
   [RFC4871] (updated by [RFC5672]) by specific domains.  This document
   offers secondary signing practices for additional ADSP compliance
   options whenever no Author Domain Signature is present within the
   message.  The intended purpose of TPA-Label Resource Records is to
   improve acceptance rates of genuine messages, to minimize domain use,
   to minimize success rates for phishing, to improve sorting
   protections, and to minimize a recipient's administrative costs.

   TPA-Label Resource Records authorize third-party signing domains and
   services to extend DKIM compliance options for signing practices
   defined by [RFC5617].  Domains that both reference and are listed
   within a TPA-Label resource record are to be considered equivalent to
   the authorizing Author Domain when assessing compliance with ADSP.
   The TXT resource records, associated with TPA-Labels, start with the
   'dkim' tag as defined by [RFC5617] for signing practices, and may
   contain tags specifically defined for TPA-Label Resource Records.


2.  Language and Terminology

2.1.  Terms Imported from other DKIM Specifications:

      A "Valid Signature" is any signature on a message that correctly
      verifies using the procedure described in Section 6.1 of
      [RFC4871].

      "Author Address" is defined in Section 2.3 of [RFC5617].

Internet-Draft                  TPA-Label                    August 2010


      "Author Domain" is defined in Section 2.4 of [RFC5617].

      "Alleged Author" is defined in Section 2.5 of [RFC5617].

      "Author Domain Signature" is defined in Section 2.7 of [RFC5617]


2.2.  Terms Defined by this Specification:

2.2.1.  Third Party Signature

   A "Third Party Signature" is a Valid Signature that does not qualify
   as an Author Domain Signature.

      Editor's Note: While this term is defined in Section 6.3 of
      [RFC5863] and in Section 2 of [RFC5016], this definition is in
      terms of the Author Domain Signature and avoids statements about
      any header field dependencies.

2.2.2.  Third Party Signer

   A "Third Party Signer" is a signer that adds a valid DKIM signature
   that references a domain with the 'd=' tag in the DKIM-Signature
   header field that is not the Author Domain.

2.2.3.  TPA-Label Listed Domain, TPA-LLD

   TPA-Label Listed Domain, TPA-LLD, is a TXT resource record referenced
   with a TPA-Label published within an Author Domain.  When a "tpa" tag
   exists within the TXT resource record located at the TPA-Label, the
   referencing domain (the domain used to generate the label) must be
   within the listed domain.  When the "tpa" tag does not exist, the
   referenced domain is presumed listed.  The "scope" tag may stipulate
   existence of additional header fields, or indicate alternate
   confirmation methods applied against specific email elements.  Third-
   party domain confirmation might use a DKIM signature or confirm the
   authorized domain using specific methods with various path related
   email elements.  'F' is the default confirmation scope assumed,
   indicating DKIM confirms the authorized domain when no other method
   is specified.  The 'S' and 'L' scope do not confirm the domain, but
   require at least one Sender or List-ID header field to hold the
   identity of the authorized domain respectively.  The 'e', 'h', 'm',
   and 't' indicate specific alternative methods using message elements
   to confirm the authorized domain.  Being compliant with TPA-LLD
   allows the referencing domain to informally act on behalf of the
   Author Domain.  Following [RFC5321], domain name comparisons, as well
   as TPA-Labels, are case insensitive.

Internet-Draft                  TPA-Label                    August 2010


2.2.4.  Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party Signature

   An "Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party Signature" is a Valid
   Signature in which the domain name of the DKIM signing entity, i.e.,
   the 'd=' tag in the DKIM-Signature header field, is the domain name
   referenced in the TPA-Label Resource Record published by the Author
   Domain with a scope of 'F'.  The 'F' scope indicates this third-party
   domain implements DKIM signing.  For 'S' and 'L' scopes, the
   respective Sender header field or a List-ID identifier of the List-ID
   header field must exist for either scope and contain a domain within
   the TPA-LLD for authorization to be valid.

2.2.5.  Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party Service

   An "Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party Service" is a service that
   confirms the administrative domain through the message element
   determined by the method specified by the scope of 'e', 'h', 'm', or
   't'.  For 'S' or 'L' scopes, the respective Sender header field or a
   List-ID identifier of the List-ID header field must exist for either
   scope and contain a domain within the TPA-LLD for authorization to be
   valid.


3.  Combinatorial ADSP "dkim" tag Values.

   This document defines new values listed with the ADSP "dkim" tag in
   addition to those defined in [RFC5617] Section 4.2.1.  These values
   can be appended to those currently defined or used separately.  When
   used separately, the value "all" is to be assumed to prefix the new
   values when recognized, otherwise the value "unknown" will be
   assumed.  It is not recommended to use any new value in conjunction
   with "discardable", because when not understood, a message that
   depends upon different handling might become lost.

3.1.  tpa-sig

   The ADSP dkim tag value "tpa-sig" indicates that TPA-Labels will
   offer a comprehensive list of Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party
   Signatures that may also include header field requirements.  When
   there is no valid Author Domain Signature or Author's Domain
   Acceptable Third-Party Signature, the Author Domain recommends these
   messages be refused.

3.2.  tpa-path

   The ADSP dkim tag value "tpa-path" indicates that TPA-Labels will
   offer a comprehensive list of Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party
   Signatures and Authorized Third-Party Services that may also include



Otis & Black            Expires February 11, 2011               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                  TPA-Label                    August 2010


   header field requirements.

   The "tpa-path" allows alternative path verification methods, to
   accommodate third party services lacking DKIM signatures.  The
   message element is determined by the method specified by the scope.
   When the path domain is confirmed by the specified method, and the
   message is compliant with TPA-LLD requirements, then it is also
   compliant with the Author Domain's asserted signing practices.  The
   leaf of the hostname (left most label) may need to be omitted when
   checking for TPA-Label Resource Record authorization.

   When there is no valid Author Domain Signature, or Author's Domain
   Acceptable Third-Party Signature, or Author's Domain Acceptable
   Third-Party Service, the Author Domain recommends these messages be
   refused.

   ADSP defends domains against spoofing.  Any subdomain of a domain
   publishing an ADSP with the "dkim" tag value containing "tpa-sig" or
   "tpa-path" not also publishing an MX resource record should be
   assumed to have published the same ADSP records there as well.


4.  TPA-Label Resource Record Authorization Considerations

   When an Author Domain is not within the DKIM signing domain, the TPA-
   LLD scheme can extend ADSP signing practice compliance.  The TPA-LLD
   scheme with an 'F', 'S', or 'L' scope permits a contained Third Party
   Signature to be treated as an Author Domain Signature.  The 'e', 'h',
   and 't' scopes permit acceptance based upon confirmation of the
   client hostname (EHLO/HELO).  The 'm' scope permits confirmations
   based upon the return path (Mail From) domain.  For 'S' and 'L'
   scopes, a respective Sender header field or a List-ID identifier of
   the List-ID header field must exist for at least one of the scopes,
   and contain a domain within the TPA-LLD for authorization to be
   valid.

   The 'S' and 'L' scopes support message sorting.  Any matching header
   field with a domain within the TPA-LLD allows recipients to
   differentiate sources, which satisfies requirements for any other 'S'
   or 'L' scope.  The 'S' and 'L' scopes provide Author Domains a means
   to extend restrictive policy compliance.

   The TPA-LLD scheme plays the role of only providing acceptable
   signatures or services which might be suitable for non-critical
   messages, with the goal of improving delivery acceptance, such as
   those from specific mailing-lists.  The TPA-LLD authorization scheme
   only requires that DNS publications be made by the Author Domain,
   even when signing domains and the Author Domain differ.  This

Internet-Draft                  TPA-Label                    August 2010


   approach avoids a need to exchange DKIM key related information and
   better protects private key information.  Before TPA-LLD
   authorization is deployed, the Author Domain should be assured by
   domains being authorized that appropriate measures are in place to
   authenticate those who are submitting messages.

   Retaining authentication & authorization for the From, Sender, and
   List-ID header fields, and being able to ensure third-party inclusion
   of a Sender or List-ID header fields, enhances protections afforded
   by message sorting.  This protection reduces susceptibility to
   deceptive look-alike phishing attempts.  Use of subdomains that
   assert less stringent practices, might inadvertently combine with
   those having more stringent practices when sorting is based upon
   parent domains.  Consistently using the same domain avoids confusion
   that could be exploited to deceive recipients.

   At this time, it is not practical for large ISPs to make restrictive
   ADSP assertions.  This would impair the utility of their service by
   excluding all third-party services lacking suitable source
   authentication.  However, institutions can benefit by making
   restrictive ADSP assertions that better retain recipient trust in
   their email notifications, without forgoing use of all informal
   third-party services.  Rather than using subdomains lacking ADSP
   restrictions, suitable third-party services can be authorized by
   using TPA-Labels instead.  This approach also offers a proactive
   means for recipients to filter phishing attempts.

   TPA-Label authorization will not ensure all possible spoofing is
   prevented.  However, by permitting broader use of restrictive
   practices, this should generally reduce the level of spoofing over
   what might be otherwise allowed.  Authorized third party messages
   SHOULD NOT receive annotations that indicate the message contains
   authenticated identities.  The TPA-LLD scope SHOULD include the 'S'
   or 'L' scope where appropriate to allow recipients a means to isolate
   and distinguish different message sources.

   The "dkim" tag within the TPA-Label Resource Record is normally
   expected to contain a copy of the value asserted by the ADSP Resource
   Record "dkim" tag.  When the TPA-Label Resource Record "dkim" tag
   value differs, and the message is compliant with the "scope" and
   "tpa" tag values, the TPA-Label Resource Record "dkim" tag value
   overrides the ADSP Resource Record "dkim" tag value.  When the TPA-
   Label Resource Record "dkim" tag value contains "discardable",
   compliance with the "scope" tag values is not required to override
   the ADSP Resource Record.  Use of "tpa-path" SHOULD selectively
   override the ADSP "tpa-sig" only where needed.

5.  Evaluating the Third-party Signing Domain or Service

   An Author Domain deploying a TPA-Label Resource Record does so on a
   trust basis.  Reasons for deploying TPA-Label Resource Records might
   be to allow deployment of more stringent ADSP records while also
   utilizing third-party signatures or services.

   When an authorized Third Party Signer does not employ DKIM
   authentication with ADSP or does not include Authentication-Results
   header fields [RFC5451], this could allow authorizations to be
   exploited.

5.1.  Third Party Authentication

   The Author Domain SHOULD ensure the Authorization Scope of the TPA-
   Label Resource Record is authenticated.  There are a number of ways
   email can be authenticated, and different authentication mechanisms
   validate different parts of the email.  The following are examples of
   how authorization might work.

5.1.1.  Third Party Authentication - Web Email Provider with Subscriber
        Pingbacks

   The Author Domain "example.com" wants to deploy a TPA-Label Resource
   Record to permit its traveling agents the use of
   "webmail.example.net" services.  This email provider has a closed
   user policy and adds DKIM signatures to messages on behalf of the
   "webmail.example.net" domain.

   The closed user policy of "webmail.example.net" permits subscribers
   to post messages with Author Domains that are not
   "webmail.example.net" in the From header fields, only when control of
   the Author Address has been validated by a response to an encoded
   "pingback" email.  The "webmail.example.net" service also establishes
   accounts to authenticate all users sending messages through its
   service.  Therefore, the referenced TPA-Label Resource Record can
   include an 'F' scope value to authorize Author Domain messages signed
   by this Third-Party Signer.

5.1.2.  Third Party Authentication - Closed Mailing List Example

   The Author Domain wants to deploy a TPA-Label Resource Record for a
   mailing list with a closed posting policy that redistributes email in
   a way that breaks Author Domain Signatures, but adds a DKIM signature
   on behalf of the mailing list domain and includes an Authentication-
   Results header field for posted messages.  The closed posting policy
   is enforced by requiring subscribers to validate their control of
   their Author Addresses by responding to encoded "pingback" email sent

   to these addresses.

   Since the mailing list management always verifies control of the
   Author Address, and is configured to include Authentication-Results
   header fields, and includes a List-ID header field, the referenced
   TPA-Label Resource Record can include an 'L' scope value to permit
   Author Domain messages containing an authorized List-ID domain to be
   signed by this Third-Party Signer.

5.1.3.  Third Party Authentication - Open Mailing List Example

   The Author Domain wants to deploy a TPA-Label Resource Record for a
   mailing list with an open posting policy that redistributes email in
   a way that breaks Author Domain Signatures, but that adds a DKIM
   signature on behalf of the mailing list domain and includes an
   Authentication-Results header field for posted messages.  The open
   posting policy will refuse messages lacking Author Domain Signatures
   for domains that have deployed an ADSP signing practice of "dkim=all"
   or "dkim=discardable".

   Since the list management always refuses to post an Author Address
   lacking a Author Domain Signature when the domain has deployed an
   ADSP record with an "dkim=all" or "dkim=discardable", and is
   configured to include Authentication-Results header fields, and
   includes a List-ID header field, the referenced TPA-Label Resource
   Record can include an 'L' scope value to permit Author Domain
   messages containing an authorized List-ID domain to be signed by this
   Third-Party Signer.

5.1.4.  Third Party Authentication Example - Sender Header Field

   Author Domain "example.com" wishes to temporarily employ the service
   agency "temp.example.org" to handle overflow secretarial support.
   The agency "temp.example.org" sends email on behalf of the executive
   staff of "example.com" and adds the Sender header field of
   "secretary@temp.example.org" in the email.  Since "temp.example.org"
   only allows its own staff to email through its server which adds
   "temp.example.org" DKIM signatures, a TPA-LLD can include the
   "temp.example.org" domain with an 'S' scope to specifically authorize
   messages containing the Sender header field to help ensure these
   messages are not handled as phishing attempts.

5.1.5.  Services Lacking DKIM Signatures

5.1.5.1.  Abuse and DSN Reporting

   There is likely little interest for an otherwise uninvolved domain to
   receive a massive number of bogus messages being returned as

   feedback.  Often the purpose of feedback is to discover compromised
   systems or accounts actively being exploited in some manner.  Unless
   the Author Domain is confirmed as having handled or authorized the
   handling of the message, only statistics and samples should be
   reported to the associated Autonomous System [RFC1930], and perhaps
   to the Author Domain when interest is expressed.

   The 'e', 'h', 'm', and 't' scope options within the TPA-LLD records
   allow the Author Domain to be associated through various methods with
   path related domains, when DKIM is not employed by the third-party
   service.  In this case, appropriate DSN or abuse reporting to the
   Author Domain is better assured as well.

5.1.5.2.  Third Party Authentication Example - SMTP Host

   Author Domain "example.com" makes use of invite services.  This
   service does not utilize DKIM, where the host name given by the EHLO
   command is "invite.example.net".  The Author Domain can authorize the
   domain "invite.example.net" or "example.net" with the scope of 'e' to
   improve acceptance of messages that are sent on behalf of
   "example.com" from this outbound server.


5.1.5.3.  Third Party Authentication Example - Return Path

   Author Domain "example.com" makes use of tell-a-friend services.
   This service does not utilize DKIM with its own return path as
   "customer@taf.example.net" in the SMTP exchange.  The Author Domain
   can authorize the domain "taf.example.net" with the scope of 'm' to
   improve acceptance of messages that are on behalf of "example.com"
   from this outbound server.

5.1.5.4.  Use of Path Authorization

   Those using the "tpa-path" value should not authorize domains
   requiring more than 5 network transactions to confirm their domain.
   Those implementing this ADSP extension should also limit the number
   of DNS transactions attempted, or this could negatively impact
   unrelated domains when evaluating path related protocols.

      Methods that create subsequent transactions based upon the macro
      expansion of email-address local-parts should not be used.
      Libraries that process [RFC4408] record scripts may invoke a large
      number of DNS transactions from cached records, and target
      unrelated domains with queries modulated by recipients through
      macro expansion.  Recipient processing of such scripts might
      become blocked, when found to produce significant network
      amplification from cached records during spam campaigns.

6.  DNS Representation

   The receiver obtains domain authorizations with a DNS query for an IN
   class TXT TPA-Label resource record located below the location
   specified in [RFC4871] Section 7.4 and the label "_tpa.".  The TPA-
   Label itself is generated by processing the domain in question, which
   normally matches the DKIM signature's "d=" parameter.  A TPA-Label
   Resource Record is published adjacent to the [RFC5617] conventional
   ADSP record, for example below "_tpa._domainkey.<Author-Domain>".
   The Author Domain provides authorization for other domains with the
   existence of a TPA-Label TXT resource record.  When a "tpa" tag value
   exists, it must include the referenced domain before authorization is
   valid.  Authorization to informally act on behalf of the Author
   Domain can also be limited by the "scope" tag value for specific
   message elements.

   An Author Domain may wish to delegate the listing of third-party
   services to a different administrative domain.  Ideally, this would
   be accomplished by delegating the _tpa._domainkey.<Author-Domain>
   zone to the administrative entity handling publication of TPA-Label
   Resource Records.  This delegation could also be done unilaterally
   with a [RFC2672] DNAME resource record published at
   _tpa._domainkey.<Author-Domain>.

   Character-strings contained within the TXT resource record are
   concatenated into forming a single string.  A character-string, as
   defined in [RFC1035] Section 3.3 for resource records, is a single
   length octet followed by that number of characters treated as binary
   information.


   The TPA-Label Resource Records should be located at these domains:

      <tpa-label>._tpa._domainkey.<Author-Domain>.


7.  TPA-Label and Tag Syntax Definitions

   Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications:

             asterisk = %x2A ; "*"
             dash = %x2D ; "-"
             dot = %x2E ; "."
             underscore = %x5F ; "_"
             ANY = asterisk dot ; "*."
             dns-char = ALPHA / DIGIT / dash
             id-prefix = ALPHA / DIGIT
             label = id-prefix [*61dns-char id-prefix]

             sldn = label dot label
             base-char = (dns-char / underscore)
             domain = *(label dot) sldn

             tag-list  =  tag-spec 0*( ";" tag-spec ) [ ";" ]
             tag-spec  =  *WSP tag-name *WSP "=" *WSP tag-value [WSP]
             tag-name  =  ALPHA 0*ALNUMPUNC / "dkim" / "scope" / "tpa"
             tag-value =  [ tval 0*( 1*(WSP) tval ) ]
                             ; WSP prohibited at end
             tval      =  1*VALCHAR
             VALCHAR   =  %x21-3A / %x3C-7E

             ALNUMPUNC =  ALPHA / DIGIT / "_"


8.  TPA-Label Generation

   The TPA-Label is generated by nesting functions as follows:

      "base32" function is defined in [RFC4648].

      "sha1" function is defined in [FIPS.180-2.2002].

      "lcase" converts upper-case ALPHA characters to lower-case.

      "tpa-domain" is normally the "d=" tag value defined in Section 3.5
      of [RFC4871].


      (underscore) base32( sha1( lcase(tpa-domain)))


   The TPA-Label is created from the hash value returned by the "sha1"
   function of the tpa-domain expressed in lower case ASCII.  Any
   terminating period is not included with the tpa-domain, as indicated
   by the ABNF definition.

      Note: No newline character, 0x0A, is to be appended to the end of
      the domain name, as might occur with the command line generation
      of sha1 values.  For example, these command line appended newlines
      can be avoided by using the 'echo -n" option.

   The label encoding process inputs the hash as a byte stream of four
   40-bit data blocks where each data block outputs 8 encoded
   characters.  Proceeding from left to right, a 40-bit input group is
   formed by concatenating 5 bytes.  The 40-bit input is then treated as
   8 concatenated 5-bit groups, each of which is translated into a
   single digit of the base32 alphabet.  The bit stream is ordered with

   the most-significant-bit first, being the high-order bit of the first
   byte.  The entire output is then concatenated first to last, left to
   right, into 32 characters prefixed with an underscore.


9.  TPA-Label TXT Resource Record Structure

   Every TPA-Label TXT resource record MUST start with an outbound
   signing-practices tag, so the first four characters of the record are
   lowercase "dkim", followed by optional whitespace and "=".  In
   addition to the tags defined by [RFC5617], TPA-Label syntax
   descriptions for additional tags follow the tag-value syntax
   described in section 4.2.1 of [RFC5617] and Section 3.2 of [RFC4871].
   Unrecognized tags and tags with illegal values MUST be ignored.  In
   the ABNF below, the WSP token is inherited from [RFC5322].  The ALPHA
   and DIGIT tokens are imported from [RFC5234].

   The tags used in TPA-Label resource records are as follows:

        +-------+------------------------------------------------+
        |  Tag  | Function                                       |

   the From header field are authorized to be signed by the TPA-LLD.


12.3.  Header Dependent Authorizations

12.3.1.  List-ID Header Field

   The "L" scope asserts that authorization is valid only when a List-ID
   identifier of the List-ID header field [RFC2919] contains a domain
   that is within a domain listed in the TPA-LLD "tpa" tag.

   The syntax of the List-Id header field is as follows:
      list-id-header = "List-ID:" [phrase] "<"identifier">"CRLF


12.3.2.  Sender Header Field

   The "S" scope asserts that authorization is valid only when the
   domain in the Sender header field is within the TPA-LLD.

   identifier of the List-ID header field or the Sender header field
   must contain a domain within the TPA-LLD for the authorization to be
   valid.

12.4.  SMTP Host domains

   The "e" scope asserts that host names given in [RFC5321] EHLO or HELO
   commands within TPA-LLD is authorized when the hostname resolves the
   server's IP address.


12.5.  SMTP Host domains

   The "m" scope asserts that an email-address domain in the [RFC5321]
   MAIL command within a TPA-LLD is authorized only when this email-
   address submitted to an spf [RFC4408] process returns pass.


12.7.  SMTP Host domains

   The "t" scope asserts that host names given in [RFC5321] EHLO command
   after [RFC3207] negotiation where the Cert DNS-ID domain is within
   TPA-LLD is authorized.

   Not to RFC Editor: Remove this comment before publishing.
      Currently, no general practice employs certificates to confirm the
      domain of the client initiating a connection.  This may be needed
      for clients within IPv6 IP address space where tunneling, carrier
      grade NATs, and rapid space assignment without any practical
      reverse mapping reduces the effectiveness of IP address based
      reputations.
      There is an existing TLS option for SMTP and an ongoing effort to
      standardize automated server confirmation.  It might be possible
      to leverage this effort to establish practices used at the client.
      It might also be possible to utilize the DKIM public key to verify
      a challenge signed by the client based upon keys located at its
      hostname, but this would require a change made to SMTP
      conversations defined in [RFC4954] Section 4.  For information

13.  TPA-Label Resource Record Query Transactions

   The discovery of TPA-Label resource records need not be subsequent to
   the discovery of the ADSP record specified by [RFC5617].  However,
   when no ADSP record is discovered or when it does not contain a
   "dkim" tag value of either "tpa-sig" or "tpa-path", the verifier MAY
   assume that no TPA-Label Resource Records have been published.
   Otherwise, when there is a Third Party Signature without any Author
   Domain Signature, the discovery of TPA-Label Resource Records should
   be attempted.


14.  TPA-Label Resource Record Compliance Assessment

   The signing practice compliance assessment of Third Party Signatures
   is a discretionary operation performed by the verifier.  Messages
   that have valid Author Domain Signatures are already considered to
   result in a pass.  When a verifier decides to assess compliance for
   Third Party Signatures with an Author Domain ADSP "dkim" tag value
   "tpa-sig" or "tpa-path", then, checked in succession, one of the
   following sets of conditions MUST be met for the result to be
   considered a pass.

   For Third Party Signatures, the following represents the set of "tpa-
   sig" assessment conditions to be checked:

   o  The Third Party Signature MUST validate according to [RFC4871].
   o  A TXT Resource Record, referenced by a TPA-Label created by the
      DKIM signature "d=" tag, MUST exist in DNS.
   o  The discovered TPA-Label TXT Resource Record structure MUST be
      valid.
   o  The domain that created the TPA-Label MUST be within the TPA-LLD.
   o  Where a scope of 'F', 'S', or 'L' is specified, the Author Domain
      MUST have an Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party Signature.
   o  Where a scope of 'L' or 'S' is specified, a List-ID identifier in
      the List-ID header field or a Sender header field MUST contain a
      domain within the TPA-LLD.

   Meeting all the conditions in this set results in a "tpa-sig" pass,
   where subsequent checks are then skipped.


   For Third Party Services where the Author Domain ADSP "dkim" tag
   value contains "tpa-path", and where the preceding assessment
   conditions were not met, then the following represents "tpa-path"
   assessment conditions to be checked:

   One of the three possible TXT Resource Records is checked in

   succession.  Each would be referenced by an 'h' or 'e' or 't' related
   domain given by [RFC5321] EHLO or HELO command, this domain with
   left-most label omitted, or by an 'm' related email-address domain
   within the [RFC5321] MAIL command.


   The TXT record discovery process continues until a TPA-Label TXT
   Resource Record structure is found where:

   o  The discovered TPA-Label TXT Resource Record Structure is valid.
   o  The domain that created the TPA-Label is within the TPA-LLD.
   o  The domain that created the TPA-Label corresponds with a listed
      scope of 'e', 'h' or 'm' or 't'.
   o  Where a scope of 'L' or 'S' is specified, either the domain in
      List-ID given by [RFC2919] in the List-ID header field is within
      the TPA-LLD, or a Sender header field contains a domain within the
      TPA-LLD respectively.
   o  Once these four conditions have been met, for 'h' or 'm' scopes
      the domain MUST be confirmed by submitting the domain to an spf
      process that then returns pass.  The 'e' scope MUST be confirmed
      by a forward DNS reference that resolves the address of the SMTP
      client.  The 't' scope MUST be confirm the DNS-ID in the client
      certificate.

   Meeting all four conditions in this set, and confirming the domain,
   results in a "tpa-path" pass.


   When the TPA-Label TXT Resource Record can not be retrieved due to
   some error that is likely transient in nature, as specified in
   [RFC5617] Section 4.3. such as "SERVFAIL" for example, the result of
   the TPA-Label Resource Record compliance assessment is "temperror".

   When the TPA-Label TXT Resource Record retrieval returns a DNS
   "NOERROR", but not with a single record, the result of the TPA-Label
   Resource Record compliance assessment is "permerror".

   When the TPA-Label TXT Resource Record can not be retrieved with a
   DNS "NXDOMAIN" response,the result of the TPA-Label Resource Record
   compliance assessment is "nxdomain".


   The following pass conditions are combined to provide a single pass
   value.
   o  A "tpa-sig" pass confirms an Author Domain Acceptable Third-Party
      Signature.
   o  A "tpa-path" pass confirms an Author Domain Acceptable Service.

16.  Security Considerations

   This draft extends signing practices for [RFC4871] where most generic
   DKIM Signature related security matters are discussed.  Additional
   considerations are also included in [I-D.ietf-dkim-mailinglists].
   Security considerations for the TPA-LLD scheme are mostly related to
   attempts on the part of malicious senders to falsely represent
   themselves as other senders, often in an attempt to defraud either
   the recipient or the alleged originator.

   Additional security considerations regarding DKIM signing practices
   may be found in the DKIM threat analysis [RFC4686].

16.1.  Benefits to Recipients

   The verifier, after finding either an Author's Domain Acceptable
   Third-Party Signature or Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party
   Service in a message, will have significantly greater confidence in
   the Third-Party, than when no TPA-Label Resource Record is obtained.
   This enhanced confidence may, at the recipients' discretion, cause a
   message to be delivered to the recipient without further source
   related assessment.

16.2.  Risks to Recipients

   The decisions a recipient makes in regard to message filtering based
   on TPA-Label Resource Records are likely to depend on the system
   integrity of the Third Party with respect to the Authentication (see
   Section 5.1) and the provided scope labels.  When the 'e', 'h', or
   'm' scoped domain is not confirmed or the third-party domain does not
   authenticate the sender, there is a risk of accepting potentially
   spoofed messages.  When there is no out-of-band authentication
   confirming the sender, Authentication-Results header fields then play
   an important role.  Without proper Authentication-Results handling by
   the third-party, there is also risk of accepting potentially spoofed
   messages.

   With this specification, third party signatures have verifiable
   value.  When implementing the compliance assessment of third party
   signatures and TPA-Label Resource Records, implementers need to
   consider the possibility that a Bad Actor will send the recipient a
   message with a large number of valid DKIM Signatures.  Verifying all
   of these may consume a large amount of processing resources such that
   it may be worth checking the existence of a TPA-Label Resource Record
   first.  Section 13 describes a quick check to see if TPA-Label
   Resource Records may exist.  Additionally validating DKIM signatures
   and obtaining related resource records might be limited to known
   trustworthy domains.

Internet-Draft                  TPA-Label                    August 2010


   Services that depend only upon path authorizations might permit the
   Author Domain to be spoofed and yet obtain acceptance.  During such
   events, the Author Domain might need to retract its authorization
   from the service.  For this reason, "tpa-path" authorization should
   only be used as a carefully monitored interim solution.

16.3.  Benefits to Author Domains

   TPA-Label resource records can replace domain delegations, selector/
   key record mirroring, or key exchanges.  A significant number of
   details are associated with selector/key records.  These details
   include user limitations, suitable services, key resource record's
   Time-To-Live, revocation and update procedures, and how the DKIM
   Signature header field's 'i=' semantics are to be applied.  In
   addition, services that depend upon DKIM keys are better secured by
   not delegating these DKIM keys, where instead the TPA-LLD scheme
   allows Author Domains an ability to limit the scope of their
   authorizations, while also not being mistaken for having
   authenticated the entity submitting the message.

   TPA-Label Resource Records convey which domains are authoritative
   even when they are not the Author Domain.  However, authorized
   domains are unable to utilize the DKIM signature's 'i=' semantics to
   directly assert which identifiers on whose behalf a signature was
   added.  As such, no domain should be authorized unless it is trusted
   to ensure the Alleged Author of an email undergoes authentication
   that offers acceptable protections for the Author Domain.  For
   example, such authentication might ensure submitting entities have
   demonstrated receipt of "pingback" messages sent to the Author
   Address contained within the messages being signed.

   By deploying TPA-Label Resource Records, Author Domains benefit when
   recipients assess signing practice compliance by using the TPA-LLD
   scheme.  These recipients will be less likely to drop the Author
   Domain's genuine messages, whenever the Author Domain attempts to
   restrict acceptance.  Restricting acceptance of non-compliant
   messages is the basic motivation for publishing ADSP records.  In
   addition, recipients are more likely to validate Authorized Third
   Party Domain Signatures.

   Broader use of restrictive ADSP policies provides a better likelihood
   of being able to eliminate a greater range of non-compliant messages,
   in addition to improving acceptance from authorized sources.  With
   authorization, scope labels allow the Author Domain to control
   message attributes even from the authorized third parties.

   Signing domains having good reputations referenced by a TPA-LLD might
   therefore provide a means to safely extend limited compliance

   assessment resources to otherwise unknown domains or SMTP Clients.

16.4.  Risks to Author Domains

   As indicated in Section 5, there is ultimately a trust of the third
   party domain to do the right thing and not generate, or allow others
   to generate, messages that falsely appear to be from the Author
   Domain.  The authentication methods in place for different email
   elements need to be carefully reflected in the scope of the TPA
   records.

   By authorizing mailing lists with TPA-Label Resource Records, this
   could cause a loss of confidentiality in mailing list participation
   by the Author Domain.  This might help Bad Actors deduce which
   subscription related email the Author Domain may receive.  Because of
   the hashing function in generating the TPA-label, anyone wishing to
   discover which domains are being authorized, has to probe each TPA-
   label based on the exact signing domain.  In addition, service
   organizations or community groups are able to share comprehensive
   lists which means, even though the domain has been authorized, that
   in itself does not mean the Author Domain is exchanging messages with
   the authorized domain.

16.5.  Benefits to Third Party Signers

   Third Party Signers benefit by allowing those using their service,
   the autonomy to authorize their service without needing to exchange
   DKIM key related details.  This is particularly useful for mailing
   lists.

16.6.  Risks caused by Third Party Signers

   As mentioned before, Third Party Signers need to authenticate
   messages from Author Domains.  This authentication provides a safety
   mechanism for the Author Domain and their recipients.  The Third
   Party may not be aware of the authentication value or the message
   elements involved and make changes without understanding the impact
   this may have upon targeted Author Domains and their recipients.  For
   example, the Third Party might stop DKIM signing or stop applying
   Authentication-Results header fields.  The unexpected exposure might
   enable wide spread abuse and prove detrimental for both the Author
   Domain and their recipients.

16.7.  SHA-1 Collisions

   The use of the SHA-1 hash algorithm does not represent a security
   concern.  The hash simply ensures a deterministic domain-name size is
   achieved.  Unexpected collisions can be detected and handled by using

   the extended TPA-Label Resource Record "tpa=" option.  The use of
   TPA-Label Resource Records without the TPA-Label "tpa=" options does
   present an opportunity for an adversary to attempt to find a hash
   collision.  Message spoofing outside the realm of DKIM protection is
   likely easier to achieve than finding hash collisions.  There is
   minimal risk of TPA-Labels colliding.  Listing 3 x 10^45 domains has
   less than a 0.1 percent risk of any two domain labels colliding.

16.8.  DNS Limits

   Use of the TPA-Label Resource Records, rather than simply listing the
   authorized domain, ensures the DNS record size is independent of the
   Third Party Domain.  The typical domain name size has been steadily
   increasing.  This increase has been caused by domain names that
   encode international character sets.  Perhaps soon there will be a
   further increase spurred by an expanse of TLDs having larger
   international labels.

   The maximum domain name size allowed, per [RFC1034] Section 3, is 255
   bytes (or octets).  Each label has a byte for its length.  Every
   domain name has a right most label representing the root with a zero
   length, for another byte.  A scheme that concatenates a listed domain
   with the publishing domain, separated by some conventional label,
   reduces the maximal domain name in half, where the conventional label
   reduces this further.

   If "_tpa." were used as the conventional label with a simple listing
   method, the maximum domain name size this supports would be 122
   bytes.  The suffix for TPA-Labels is "_tpa.domainkey." which consumes
   16 bytes.  The TPA-Label itself consumes 34 bytes.  A domain that
   publishes the TPA-labels in its domain would then have 205 bytes
   available for their Author Domain.  Since an Author's Domain
   Acceptable Third-Party Service might not implement DKIM, the TPA-
   Label is still able to authorize any domain name with a valid length.
   As a result, the maximum allowable Author Domain is increased by 83
   bytes or 68% over simple name concatenation.

   Normally, DNS messages should not exceed 512 bytes as per Section
   2.3.4 of [RFC1035].  Using TPA-Label Resource Records in the DNS, as
   described by this document, consumes a consistent 50 bytes, in
   addition to the domain name publishing the TPA-Labels.  With this
   being constant, a limit can be determined as a constraint to resource
   record size, to ensure a response does not exceed the maximum DNS
   message size.  DNS servers that add additional resource records, for
   nameservers as an example, will further reduce available resource
   record capacity.  Domains publishing TPA-Labels exceeding the DNS
   message limit will need to rely on recipients using TCP for DNS
   retrieval, or EDNS0 [RFC2671] for extended DNS lengths.
