   This document specifies a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
   option for the civil (country, street and community) location of the
   client.

2. Introduction

   Many end system services can benefit by knowing the approximate
   location of the end device. In particular, IP telephony devices need
   to know their location to contact the appropriate emergency response
   agency and to be found by emergency responders.

   There are two common ways to identify the location of an object,
   either through geospatial coordinates or by so-called civil
   coordinates. Geospatial coordinates indicate longitude, latitude and
   altitude, while civil coordinates indicate a street address.

   A related draft [6] describes a DHCP [2] option for conveying
   geospatial information to a device.  This draft describes how DHCP
   can be used to convey the civil location to devices.  Both can be
   used simultaneously, increasing the chance to deliver accurate and
   timely location information to emergency responders.

   End systems that obtain location information via the mechanism
   described here then use other protocol mechanisms to communicate this
   information to the emergency call center.

   Civil information is useful since it often provides additional,
   human-usable information particularly within buildings.  Also,
   compared to geospatial information, it is readily obtained for most
   occupied structures and can often be interpreted even if incomplete.
   For example, for many large university or corporate campuses,
   geocoding information to building and room granularity may not be
   readily available.

   Unlike geospatial information, the format for civil information
   differs from country to country.  Thus, this draft establishes an
   IANA registry for civil location data fields.  The initial set of
   data fields is derived from standards published by the United States
   National Emergency Numbering Association (NENA) [8].  It is
   anticipated that other countries can reuse many of the data elements.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Each civil address element has the following format:

   0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Code TBD: The code for this DHCP option is TBD by IANA.

   N: The length of this option is variable.

   Countrycode: The two-letter ISO 3166 country code in capital ASCII
      letters, e.g., DE or US.

   What: The 'what' element describes which location the DHCP refers to.
      Currently, three options are defined:  the location of the DHCP
      server (0), the location of the network element believed to be
      closest to the client (1) or the location of the client (2).
      Option (2) SHOULD be used, but may not be known.  Options (1) and
      (2) SHOULDNOT be used unless it is known that the DHCP client is
      in close physical proximity to the server or network element.



   CAtype: A one-octet descriptor of the data civil address value.

   CAlength: The length, in octets, of the CAvalue, not including the
      CAlength field itself. Data SHOULD be encoded in uppercase.

   CAvalue: The civil address value, encoded as UTF-8, and written in
      uppercase letters where applicable.

4. Civil Address Components

   Since each country has different administrative hierarchies, with
   often the same (English) names, this specification adopts a simple
   hierarchical notation that is then instantiated for each country.  We
   assume that five levels are sufficient for sub-national divisions
   above the street level.

   All elements are OPTIONAL and can appear in any order.  Abbreviations
   do not need a trailing period.

   The CA types labeled in the second column correspond to items from
   the NENA "Recommended Formats & Protocols For ALI Data Exchange, ALI
   Response & GIS Mapping" [8], but are applicable to most countries.
   The "NENA" column refers to the data dictionary name in Exhibit 18 of
   [8].

   The NAM object is used to aid user location ("Joe Miller" "Alice's
   Dry Cleaning").  It does not identify the person using a
   communications device, but rather the person or organization
   associated with the address.

   For POD and PRD, in English-speaking countries, the abbreviations N,
   E, S, W, and NE, NW, SE, SW should be used.

   STS designates a street suffix.  In the United States (US), the
   abbreviations recommended by the United States Postal Service
   Publication 28 [7], Appendix C, SHOULD be used.

   The "type of place" item indicates whether the location is a 'home',
   'office' or 'public', using text strings.  Additional text strings
   can be registered with IANA and correspond to the "placetype" element
   in [9].

   The "privacy" object can have the string values:

   public: Others may be able to see or hear the communications.

   private: Inappropriate individuals are not likely to see or hear the
      communications.

   quiet: The location is a place such as a library, restaurant,
      place-of-worship, or theater that discourages noise, conversation
      and other distractions.

   Additional string values can be registered with IANA using the
   registry established in [9].

   The DHCP long-options mechanism described in RFC 3396 [3] MUST be
   used if the civil address option exceeds the maximum DHCP option size
   of 255 octets.

5. Security Considerations

   The information in this option may be used for a variety of tasks. In
   some cases, integrity of the information may be of great importance.
   In such cases, DHCP authentication in RFC3118 [4] SHOULD be used to
   protect the integrity of the DHCP options.
