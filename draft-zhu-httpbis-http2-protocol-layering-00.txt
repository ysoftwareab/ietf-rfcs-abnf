INTERNET DRAFT        Protocol Layering in HTTP/2          March 3, 2014


1  Introduction

   This document discusses requirements that will allow HTTP/2 [I-
   D.ietf-httpbis-http2] to be used as a generic transport for use cases
   beyond the basic HTTP/1.1 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics] request-
   response messaging.


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2  Use Cases

   Specifically we have the following use cases in mind:

   1. Map HTML5 WebSocket API [WSAPI] to HTTP/2 directly.

   2. Map non-XHR [XHR] APIs, for example HTML5 Server-Sent Events
      [ServerSent] to HTTP/2 without requiring additional layers of
      framing within the HTTP payload.

   3. Map non-browser, bidirectional messaging protocols such as XMPP
      [RFC6120] or future cloud protocols to HTTP/2 to benefit from the
      ubiquitous infrastructure support of HTTP.

3  Requirements

3.1  Message Boundary

   To enable the above use cases, the DATA frames of HTTP/2 SHOULD
   include a flag to mark the message boundary, for example END_SEGMENT
   as defined in [I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2].

   This boundary SHOULD be preserved by any proxy that understands
   HTTP/2.

   For HTTP/1.1 gateways, we expect the message boundary will be
   preserved as chunked Transfer-Encoding.  T-E however is a hop-by-hop
   property and downstream proxies may still break the message boundary
   by re-chunking the request or response payload.  Since it's likely
   that the server will only speak HTTP/1.1, and therefore the client
   API mapping is expected to fall-back to HTTP/1.1.

3.2  Scheme Header

   The initial HEADERS frame for a new stream SHOULD include the URL
   scheme to indicate the scheme as understood by client or server
   applications, e.g. "http", "ws", "xmpp".

   A new HTTP/2 error status code SHOULD be introduced to indicate that
   a given scheme is not supported by the server, e.g.
   "SCHEME_NOT_SUPPORTED", "SCHEME_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_PROXY".

   Whether or not the scheme is "http", a new HTTP error code MAY be
   defined to inform the HTTP/2 capable client with an optional payload
   that the origin server does not support the given scheme.

3.3  Load Balancers

   These requirements enable L7 load balancers to mux or demux and
   perform other load balancing based on a simple examination of scheme,
   host, and port.

3.4  Protocol Layering

   We don't expect any ALPN identifier to be used for these non-HTTP
   protocols. This allows us to layer any non-HTTP protocol on top of
   HTTP/2 without requiring changes to the infrastructure created for
   HTTP/2.
