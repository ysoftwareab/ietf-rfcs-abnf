1.  Introduction

   This document describes the problem statement for Interface to
   Network Security Functions (I2NSF) as well as some I2NSF use cases.
   A summary of the state of the art in the industry and IETF which is
   relevant to I2NSF work is documented in
   [I-D.hares-i2nsf-gap-analysis].

   The growing challenges and complexity in maintaining a secure
   infrastructure, complying with regulatory requirements, and
   controlling costs are enticing enterprises into consuming network
   security functions hosted by service providers.  The hosted security
   service is especially attractive to small and medium size enterprises
   who suffer from a lack of security experts to continuously monitor
   networks, acquire new skills and propose immediate mitigations to
   ever increasing sets of security attacks.

   According to [Gartner-2013], the demand for hosted (or cloud-based)
   security services is growing.  Small and medium-sized businesses
   (SMBs) are increasingly adopting cloud-based security services to
   replace on-premises security tools, while larger enterprises are
   deploying a mix of traditional and cloud-based security services.

   To meet the demand, more and more service providers are providing
   hosted security solutions to deliver cost-effective managed security
   services to enterprise customers.  The hosted security services are
   primarily targeted at enterprises (especially small/medium ones), but
   could also be provided to any kind of mass-market customer.  As a
   result, the Network Security Functions (NSFs) are provided and
   consumed in a large variety of environments.  Users of NSFs may
   consume network security services hosted by one or more providers,
   which may be their own enterprise, service providers, or a
   combination of both.  This document also briefly describes the
   following use cases summarized by
   [I-D.pastor-i2nsf-merged-use-cases]:

   o  [I-D.pastor-i2nsf-access-usecases] (I2NSF-Access),

   o  [I-D.zarny-i2nsf-data-center-use-cases](I2NSF-DC), and

   o  [I-D.qi-i2nsf-access-network-usecase] (I2NSF-Mobile).

2.  Terminology

   ACL:   Access Control List

   B2B:   Business-to-Business

   Bespoke:   Something made to fit a particular person, client or
      company.

   Bespoke security management:   Security management which is made to
      fit a particular customer.

   DC:    Data Center

   FW:    Firewall

   IDS:    Intrusion Detection System

   IPS:    Intrusion Protection System

   I2NSF:    interface to Network Security Functions.

   NSF:    Network Security Function.  An NSF is a function that detects
      abnormal activity and blocks/mitigates the effect of such abnormal
      activity in order to preserve the availability of a network or a
      service.  In addition, the NSF can help in supporting
      communication stream integrity and confidentiality.

   Flow-based NSF:    An NSF which inspects network flows according to a
      security policy.  Flow-based security also means that packets are
      inspected in the order they are received, and without altering
      packets due to the inspection process (e.g., MAC rewrites, TTL
      decrement action, or NAT inspection or changes).

   Virtual NSF:    An NSF which is deployed as a distributed virtual
      resource.

   VNFPool:    Pool of Virtual Network Functions.

3.  Problem Space

   The following sub-section describes the problems and challenges
   facing customers and security service providers when some or all of
   the security functions are no longer physically hosted by the
   customer's adminstrative domain.

   Security service providers can be internal or external to the
   company.  For example, an internal IT Security group within a large

   enterprise could act as a security service provider for the
   enterprise.  In contrast, an enterprise could outsource all security
   services to an external security service provider.  In this document,
   the security service provider function whether it is internal or
   external, will be denoted as "service provider".

   The "Customer-Provider" relationship may be between any two parties.
   The parties can be in different firms or different domains of the
   same firm.  Contractual agreements may be required in such contexts
   to formally document the customer's security requirements and the
   provider's guarantees to fulfill those requirements.  Such agreements
   may detail protection levels, escalation procedures, alarms
   reporting, etc.  There is currently no standard mechanism to capture
   those requirements.

   A service provider may be a customer of another service provider.

3.1.  Challenges Facing Security Service Providers

3.1.1.  Diverse Types of Security Functions

   There are many types of NSFs.  NSFs by different vendors can have
   different features and have different interfaces.  NSFs can be
   deployed in multiple locations in a given network, and perhaps have
   different roles.

   Below are a few examples of security functions and locations or
   contexts in which they are often deployed:

   External Intrusion and Attack Protection:   Examples of this function
      are firewall/ACL authentication, IPS, IDS, and endpoint
      protection.

   Security Functions in a DMZ:   Examples of this function are
      firewall/ACLs, IDS/IPS, authentication and authorization services,
      NAT, forwarding proxies, application, and AAA services.  These
      functions may be physically on-premise in a server provider's
      network at the DMZ spots or located in a "virtual" DMZ.

   Internal Security Analysis and Reporting:   Examples of this function
      are security logs, event correlation, and forensic analysis.

   Internal Data and Content Protection:   Examples of this function are
      encryption, authorization, and public/private key management for
      internal database.

   Given the diversity of security functions, the contexts in which
   these functions can be deployed, and the constant evolution of these

Internet-Draft           I2NSF Problem/Use Case             October 2016


   functions, standardizing all aspects of security functions is
   challenging, and most probably not feasible.  Fortunately, it is not
   necessary to standardize all aspects.  For example, from an I2NSF
   perspective, there is no need to standardize on how firewall filters
   are created or applied.

   What is needed is a standardized interface to control and monitor the
   rule sets that NSFs use to treat packets traversing through.  And
   standardizing interfaces will provide an impetuous for standardizing
   established security functions.

3.1.2.  Diverse Interfaces to Control and Monitor NSFs

   To provide effective and competitive solutions and services, Security
   Service Providers may need to utilize multiple security functions
   from various vendors to enforce the security policies desired by
   their customers.

   Since no widely accepted industry standard security interface exists
   today, management of NSFs (device and policy provisioning,
   monitoring, etc.) tends to be bespoke security management offered by
   product vendors.  As a result, automation of such services, if it
   exists at all, is also bespoke.  Thus, even in the traditional way of
   deploying security features, there is a gap to coordinate among
   implementations from distinct vendors.  This is the main reason why
   mono-vendor security functions are often deployed and enabled in a
   particular network segment.

   A challenge for monitoring is that an NSF cannot monitor what it
   cannot view.  Therefore, enabling a security function (e.g., firewall
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-firewalls]) does not mean that a network is
   protected.  As such, it is necessary to have a mechanism to monitor
   and provide execution status of NSFs to security and compliance
   management tools.  There exist various network security monitoring
   vendor-specific interfaces for forensics and troubleshooting.

3.1.3.  More Distributed NSFs and vNSFs

   The security functions which are invoked to enforce a security policy
   can be located in different equipment and network locations.

   The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) Network
   Function Virtualization (NFV) initiative creates new management
   challenges for security policies to be enforced by distributed,
   virtual, and network security functions (vNSF).

   A vNSF has higher risk of failure, migrating, and state changes as
   their hosting VMs are being created, moved, or decommissioned.

Internet-Draft           I2NSF Problem/Use Case             October 2016


3.1.4.  More Demand to Control NSFs Dynamically

   In the advent of Software-Defined Networking (see
   [I-D.jeong-i2nsf-sdn-security-services]), more clients, applications
   or application controllers need to dynamically update their security
   policies that are enforced by NSFs.  The Security Service Providers
   have to dynamically update their decision-making process (e.g., in
   terms of NSF resource allocation and invocation) upon receiving
   requests from their clients.

3.1.5.  Demand for Multi-Tenancy to Control and Monitor NSFs

   Service providers may need several operational units to control and
   monitor the NSFs, especially when NSFs become distributed and
   virtualized.

3.1.6.  Lack of Characterization of NSFs and Capability Exchange

   To offer effective security services, service providers need to
   activate various security functions in NSFs or vNSFs manufactured by
   multiple vendors.  Even within one product category (e.g., firewall),
   security functions provided by different vendors can have different
   features and capabilities.  For example, filters that can be designed
   and activated by a firewall may or may not support IPv6 depending on
   the firewall technology.

   The service provider's management system (or controller) needs a way
   to retrieve the capabilities of service functions by different
   vendors so that it could build an effective security solution.  These
   service function capabilities can be documented in a static manner
   (e.g., a file) or via an interface which accesses a repository of
   security function capabilities which the NSF vendors dynamically
   update.

   A dynamic capability registration is useful for automation because
   security functions may be subject to software and hardware updates.
   These updates may have implications on the policies enforced by the
   NSFs.

   Today, there is no standard method for vendors to describe the
   capabilities of their security functions.  Without a common technical
   framework to describe the capabilities of security functions, service
   providers cannot automate the process of selecting NSFs by different
   vendors to accommodate customer's requirements.

Internet-Draft           I2NSF Problem/Use Case             October 2016


3.1.7.  Lack of Mechanism for NSFs to Utilize External Profiles

   Many security functions depend on signature files or profiles to
   perform (e.g., IPS/IDS signatures, DOTS filters).  Different policies
   might need different signatures or profiles.  Today, the construction
   and use of black list databases can be a win-win strategy for all
   parties involved.  There might be Open Source-provided signature/
   profiles (e.g., by Snort or others) in the future.

   There is a need to have a standard envelop (i.e., the format) to
   allow NSFs to use external profiles.

3.1.8.  Lack of Mechanisms to Accept External Alerts to Trigger
        Automatic Rule and Configuration Changes

   NSF can ask the I2NSF security controller to alter a specific rules
   and/or configurations.  For example, a DDoS alert could trigger a
   change to the routing system to send traffic to a traffic scrubbing
   service to mitigate the DDoS.

   The DDoS protection has the following two parts: a) the configuration
   of signaling of open threats and b) DDoS mitigation.  DOTS controller
   manages the signaling part of DDoS.  I2NSF controller(s) would manage
   the changing to the affected policies (e.g., forwarding and routing,
   filtering, etc.).  By monitoring the network alerts from DDoS, I2NSF
   can feed an alerts analytics engine that could recognize attacks and
   the I2NSF can thus enforce the appropriate policies.

   DDoS mitigation is enhanced if the provider's network security
   controller can monitor, analyze, and investigate the abnormal events
   and provide information to the client or change the network
   configuration automatically.

   [I-D.zhou-i2nsf-capability-interface-monitoring] provides details on
   how monitoring aspects of the flow-based Network Security Functions
   (NSFs) can use the I2NSF interfaces to receive traffic reports and
   enforce policy.

3.1.9.  Lack of Mechanism for Dynamic Key Distribution to NSFs

   There is a need for a controller to distribute various keys to
   distributed NSFs.  To distribute various keys, the keys must be
   created and managed.  While there are many key management methods and
   key derivation functions (KDF), there is a lack of standard interface
   to provision and manage keys.

   The keys may be used for message authentication and integrity in
   order to protect data flows.  In addition, keys may be used to secure

   the protocol and messages in the core routing infrastructure
   ([RFC4948])

   As of now there is not much focus on an abstraction for keying
   information that describes the interface between protocols,
   operators, and automated key management.

   The ability to utilize keys when routing protocols send or receive
   messages will be enhanced by having an abstract key table maintained
   by a security service.  Conceptually, there must be an interface
   defined for routing/signaling protocols to make requests for
   automated key management when it is being used, to notify the
   protocols when keys become available in the key table.

   An abstract key service will work under the following conditions:

   1.  I2NSF needs to design the key table abstraction, the interface
       between key management protocols and routing/other protocols, and
       possibly security protocols at other layers.

   2.  For each routing/other protocol, I2NSF needs to define the
       mapping between how the protocol represents key material and the
       protocol-independent key table abstraction.  (If protocols share
       common mechanisms for authentication (e.g., TCP Authentication
       Option), then the same mapping may be reused.)

   3.  Automated Key management must support both symmetric keys and
       group keys via the service provided by items 1 and 2.

3.2.  Challenges Facing Customers

   When customers invoke hosted security services, their security
   policies may be enforced by a collection of security functions hosted
   in different domains.  Customers may not have the security skills to
   express sufficiently precise requirements or security policies.
   Usually, these customers express the expectations of their security
   requirements or the intent of their security policies.  These
   expectations can be considered customer level security expectations.
   Customers may also desire to express guidelines for security
   management.  Examples of such guidelines include:

   o  Which critical communications are to be preserved during critical
      events (DOTS),

   o  Which hosts are to continue service even during severe security
      attacks (DOTS),

   o  Reporting of attacks to CERT (MILE),

   o  Managing network connectivity of systems out of compliance (SACM),

3.2.1.  NSFs from Heterogeneous Administrative Domains

   Many medium and large enterprises have deployed various on-premises
   security functions which they want to continue to deploy.  These
   enterprises want to combine local security functions with remote
   hosted security functions to achieve more efficient and immediate
   counter-measures to both Internet-originated attacks and enterprise
   network-originated attacks.

   Some enterprises may only need the hosted security services for their
   remote branch offices where minimal security infrastructures/
   capabilities exist.  The security solution will consist of deploying
   NSFs on customer networks and on service provider networks.

3.2.2.  Today's Control Requests are Vendor Specific

   Customers may consume NSFs by multiple service providers.  Customers
   need to express their security requirements, guidelines, and
   expectations to the service providers.  In turn, the service
   providers must translate this customer information into customer
   security policies and associated configuration tasks for the set of
   security functions in their network.  Without a standard technical
   characterization or a standard interface, the service provider faces
   many challenges:

   No standard technical characterization and/or APIs  :  Even for the
      most common security services there is no standard technical
      characterization or APIs.  Most security services are accessible
      only through disparate, proprietary interfaces (e.g., portals or
      APIs) in whatever format vendors choose to offer.  The service
      provider must have the customer's input to manage these widely
      varying interfaces.

   No standard interface:    Without standard interfaces it is complex
      for customers to update security policies or integrate the
      security functions in their enterprise with the security services
      provided by the security service providers.  This complexity is
      induced by the diversity of the configuration models, policy
      models, and supported management interfaces.  Without a standard
      interface, new innovative security products find a large barrier
      to entry into the market.

   Managing by scripts de-jour:    The current practices rely upon the
      use of scripts that generate other scripts which automatically run
      to upload or download configuration changes, log information and
      other things.  These scripts have to be adjusted each time an

      implementation from a different vendor technology is enabled on a
      provider side.

   Lack of immediate feedback:    Customers may also require a mechanism
      to easily update/modify their security requirements with immediate
      effect in the underlying involved NSFs.

   Lack of explicit invocation request:    While security agreements are
      in place, security functions may be solicited without requiring an
      explicit invocation means.  Nevertheless, some explicit invocation
      means may be required to interact with a service function.

   To see how standard interfaces could help achieve faster
   implementation time cycles, let us consider a customer who would like
   to dynamically allow an encrypted flow with specific port, src/dst
   addresses or protocol type through the firewall/IPS to enable an
   encrypted video conferencing call only during the time of the call.
   With no commonly accepted interface in place, the customer would have
   to learn about the particular provider's firewall/IPS interface and
   send the request in the provider's required format.

   In contrast, if a firewall/IPS interface standard exists, the
   customer would be able to send the request, without having to do the
   extensive preliminary legwork.  A standard interface also helps
   service providers since they could now offer the same firewall/IPS
   interface to represent firewall/IPS services for utilizing products
   from many vendors.  The result is that the service provider has now
   abstracted the firewall/IPS services.  The standard interface also
   helps the firewall/IPS vendors to focus on their core security
   functions or extended features rather than the standard building
   blocks of a management interface.

3.2.3.  Difficulty to Monitor the Execution of Desired Policies

   How a policy is translated into technology-specific actions is hidden
   from the customers.  However, customers still need ways to monitor
   the delivered security service that results from the execution of
   their desired security requirements, guidelines and expectations.

   Today, there is no standard way for customers to get security service
   assurance of their specified security policies properly enforced by
   the security functions in the provider domain.  The customer also
   lacks the ability to perform "what-if" scenarios to assess the
   efficiency of the delivered security service.

3.3.  Difficulty to Validate Policies across Multiple Domains

   One key aspect of a hosted security service with security functions
   located at different premises is the ability to express, monitor and
   verify security policies that combine several distributed security
   functions.  It is crucial to an effective service to be able to take
   these actions via a standard interface.  This standard interface
   becomes more crucial to the hosted security service when NSFs are
   instantiated in Virtual Machines which are sometimes widely
   distributed in the network and sometimes are combined together in one
   device to perform a set of tasks for delivering a service.

   Without standard interfaces and security policy data models, the
   enforcement of a customer-driven security policy remains challenging
   because of the inherent complexity created by combining the
   invocation of several vendor-specific security functions into a
   multi-vendor, heterogeneous environment.  Each vendor-specific
   function may require specific configuration procedures and
   operational tasks.

   Ensuring the consistent enforcement of the policies at various
   domains is also challenging.  Standard data models are likely to
   contribute to addressing that issue.

3.4.  Lack of Standard Interface to Inject Feedback to NSF

   Today, many security functions, such as IPS, IDS, DDoS and Antivirus,
   depend heavily on the associated profiles.  They can perform more
   effective protection if they have the up-to-date profiles.  As more
   sophisticated threats arise, enterprises, vendors, and service
   providers have to rely on each other to achieve optimal protection.
   Cyper Threat Alliance (CA, http://cyberthreatalliance.org/) is one of
   those initiatives that aim at combining efforts conducted by multiple
   organizations.

Internet-Draft           I2NSF Problem/Use Case             October 2016


   Today there is no standard interface to exchange security profiles
   between organizations.

3.5.  Lack of Standard Interface for Capability Negotiation

   There could be situations when the selected NSFs cannot perform the
   policies requested by the Security Controller, due to resource
   constraints.  The customer and security service provider should
   negotiate the appropriate resource constraints before the security
   service begins.  However, unexpected events somethings happen and the
   NSF may exhaust those negotiated resources.  At this point, the NSF
   should inform the security controller that the alloted resources have
   been exhausted.  To support the automatic control in the SDN-era, it
   is necessary to have a set of messages for proper notification (and a
   response to that notification) between the Security Controller and
   the NSFs.

4.  Use Cases

   Standard interfaces for monitoring and controlling the behavior of
   NSFs are essential building blocks for Security Service Providers and
   enterprises to automate the use of different NSFs from multiple
   vendors by their security management entities.  I2NSF may be invoked
   by any (authorized) client.  Examples of authorized clients are
   upstream applications (controllers), orchestration systems, and
   security portals.

4.1.  Basic Framework

   Users request security services through specific clients (e.g., a
   customer application, the NSP BSS/OSS or management platform) and the
   appropriate NSP network entity will invoke the (v)NSFs according to
   the user service request.  This network entity is denoted as the
   security controller in this document.  The interaction between the
   entities discussed above (client, security controller, NSF) is shown
   in Figure 2:

                                +----------+
         +-------+              |          |                  +-------+

                                +----------+

                    Figure 2: Interaction between Entities





Hares, et al.             Expires April 8, 2017                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft           I2NSF Problem/Use Case             October 2016


   Interface 1 is used for receiving security requirements from client
   and translating them into commands that NSFs can understand and
   execute.  The security controller also passes back NSF security
   reports (e.g., statistics) to the client which the control has
   gathered from NSFs.  Interface 2 is used for interacting with NSFs
   according to commands, and collect status information about NSFs.

   Client devices or applications can require the security controller to
   add, delete or update rules in the security service function for
   their specific traffic.

   When users want to get the executing status of a security service,
   they can request NSF status from the client.  The security controller
   will collect NSF information through Interface 2, consolidate them,
   and give feedback to client through Interface 1.  This interface can
   be used to collect not only individual service information, but also
   aggregated data suitable for tasks like infrastructure security
   assessment.

   Customers may require validating NSF availability, provenance, and
   correct execution.  This validation process, especially relevant for
   vNSFs, includes at least:

   Integrity of the NSF:   by ensuring that the NSF is not compromised;

   Isolation:   by ensuring the execution of the NSF is self-contained
      for privacy requirements in multi-tenancy scenarios.

   Provenance of NSF:    Customers may need to be provided with strict
      guarantees about the origin of the NSF, its status (e.g.
      available, idle, down, and others), and feedback mechanisms so
      that a customer may be able to check that a given NSF or set of
      NSFs properly conform to the the customer's requirements and
      subsequent configuration tasks.

   In order to achieve this, the security controller may collect
   security measurements and share them with an independent and trusted
   third party (via interface 1) in order to allow for attestation of
   NSF functions using the third party added information.

4.2.  Access Networks

   This scenario describes use cases for users (e.g. enterprise user,
   network administrator, and residential user) that request and manage
   security services hosted in the network service provider (NSP)
   infrastructure.  Given that NSP customers are essentially users of
   their access networks, the scenario is essentially associated with
   their characteristics, as well as with the use of vNSFs.

   The Virtual CPE described in [NFVUC] use cases #5 and #7 requires a
   model of access virtualization that includes mobile and residential
   access where the operator may offload security services from the
   customer local environment (e.g., device or terminal) to its own
   infrastructure.

   These use cases define the interaction between the operator and the
   vNSFs through automated interfaces, typically by means of B2B
   communications.

   Different access clients may have different service requests:

   Residential:   service requests for parental control, content
      management, and threat management.

      Parental control requests may include identity based filters for
      web content or usage.  Content management may include identifying
      and blocking malicious activities from web contents, mail, or
      files downloaded.  Threat management may include identifying and
      blocking botnets or malware.

   Enterprise:   service requests for enterprise flow security policies
      and managed security services



Hares, et al.             Expires April 8, 2017                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft           I2NSF Problem/Use Case             October 2016


      Flow security policies include access (or isolation) to data from
      various internal groups, access (or isolation) from varous web
      sites or social media applications, and encryption on data
      transferred between corporates sites (main office, enterprise
      branch offices, and remote campuses).  Managed security services
      may include detection and mitigation of external and internal
      threats.  External threats can include application or phishing
      attacks, malware, botnet, DDoS, and others.  Internal threats (aka
      lateral threats) can include detecting programs moving from one
      enterprise site to another without permission.

   Service Provider:   Service requests for policies that protect
      service providers networks against various threats (including
      DDoS, botnets and malware).  Such policies are meant to securely
      and reliably deliver contents (e.g., data, voice, video) to
      various customers, including residential, mobile and corporate
      customers.  These security policies are also enforced to guarantee
      isolation between multiple tenants, regardless of the nature of
      the corresponding connectivity services.

   Mobile:   service requests from interfaces which monitor and ensure
      user quality of experience, content management, parental controls,
      and external threat management.

      Content management for the mobile device includes identifying and
      blocking malicious activities from web contents, mail, files.
      Threat management for infrastructure includes detecting and
      removing malicious programs such as Botnet, DDoS, and Malware.

   Some access customers may not care about which NSFs are utilized to
   achieve the services they requested.  In this case, provider network
   orchestration systems can internally select the NSFs (or vNSFs) to
   enforce the policies requested by the clients.  Other access
   customers, especially some enterprise customers, may want to get
   their dedicated NSFs (most likely vNSFs) for direct control purposes.
   In this case, here are the steps to associate vNSFs to specific
   customers:

   vNSF Deployment:   The deployment process consists in instantiating a
      NSF on a Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI), within the NSP
      administrative domain(s) or with other external domain(s).  This
      is a required step before a customer can subscribe to a security
      service supported in the vNSF.

   vNSF Customer Provisioning:    Once a vNSF is deployed, any customer
      can subscribe to it.  The provisioning lifecycle includes the
      following:

      *  Customer enrollment and cancellation of the subscription to a
         vNSF;

      *  Configuration of the vNSF, based on specific configurations, or
         derived from common security policies defined by the NSP.

      *  Retrieve and list the vNSF functionalities, extracted from a
         manifest or a descriptor.  The NSP management systems can
         demand this information to offer detailed information through
         the commercial channels to the customer.

4.3.  Cloud Data Center Scenario

   In a data center, network security mechanisms such as firewalls may
   need to be dynamically added or removed for a number of reasons.
   These changes may be explicitly requested by the user, or triggered
   by a pre-agreed upon Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the user
   and the provider of the service.  For example, the service provider
   may be required to add more firewall capacity within a set timeframe
   whenever the bandwidth utilization hits a certain threshold for a
   specified period.  This capacity expansion could result in adding new
   instances of firewalls on existing machines or provisioning a
   completely new firewall instance in a different machine.

   The on-demand, dynamic nature of security service delivery
   essentially encourages that the network security "devices" be in
   software or virtual form factors, rather than in a physical appliance
   form.  This requirement is a provider-side concern.  Users of the
   firewall service are agnostic (as they should) as to whether or not
   the firewall service is run on a VM or any other form factor.
   Indeed, they may not even be aware that their traffic traverses
   firewalls.

   Furthermore, new firewall instances need to be placed in the "right
   zone" (domain).  The issue applies not only to multi-tenant
   environments where getting the tenant in the right domain is of
   paramount importance, but also in environments owned and operated by
   a single organization with its own service segregation policies.  For
   example, an enterprise may mandate that firewalls serving Internet
   traffic and Business-to-Business (B2B) traffic be separated.  Another
   example is that IPS/IDS services for investment banking and non-
   banking traffic may be separated for regulatory reasons.

4.3.1.  On-Demand Virtual Firewall Deployment

   A service provider-operated cloud data center could serve tens of
   thousands of clients.  Clients' compute servers are typically hosted
   on virtual machines (VMs), which could be deployed across different



Hares, et al.             Expires April 8, 2017                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft           I2NSF Problem/Use Case             October 2016


   server racks located in different parts of the data center.  It is
   often not technically and/or financially feasible to deploy dedicated
   physical firewalls to suit each client's security policy
   requirements, which can be numerous.  What is needed is the ability
   to dynamically deploy virtual firewalls for each client's set of
   servers based on established security policies and underlying network
   topologies.

4.3.2.  Firewall Policy Deployment Automation

   Firewall rule setting is often a time consuming, complex and error-
   prone process even within a single organization/enterprise framework.
   It becomes far more complex in provider-owned cloud networks that
   serve myriads of customers.

   Firewall rules today are highly tied with ports and addresses that
   identify traffic.  This makes it very difficult for clients of cloud
   data centers to construct rules for their own traffic as the clients
   only see the virtual networks and the virtual addresses.  The
   customer-visible virtual networks and addresses may be different from
   the actual packets traversing the FWs.

   Even though most vendors support similar firewall features, the
   actual rule configuration keywords are different from vendors to
   vendors, making it difficult for automation.  Automation works best
   when it can leverage a common set of standards that will work across
   NSFs by multiple vendors.  Without automation, it is virtually
   impossible for clients to dynamically specify their desired rules for
   their traffic.

4.3.3.  Client-Specific Security Policy in Cloud VPNs

   Clients of service provider-operated cloud data centers need not only
   to secure Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) but also virtual security
   functions that apply the clients' security policies.  The security
   policies may govern communication within the clients' own virtual
   networks as well as communication with external networks.  For
   example, VPN service providers may need to provide firewall and other
   security services to their VPN clients.  Today, it is generally not
   possible for clients to dynamically view (let alone change) what,
   where and how security policies are implemented on their provider-
   operated clouds.  Indeed, no standards-based framework exists to
   allow clients to retrieve/manage security policies in a consistent
   manner across different providers.

4.3.4.  Internal Network Monitoring

   There are many types of internal traffic monitors that may be managed
   by a security controller.  This includes a new class of services
   referred to as Data Loss Prevention (DLP), or Reputation Protection
   Services (RPS).  Depending on the class of event, alerts may go to
   internal administrators, or external services.

4.4.  I2NSF Preventing Distributed DoS in Overlay Networks

   In the internet where everything is connected, preventing unwanted
   traffic that may cause Denial of Service (DoS) attack or distributed
   DoS (DDoS) has become a challenge.  One place where DDoS can be
   challenging to prevent or mitigate is in overlay networks.  Many
   networks such as Internet of Things (IoT) networks, Information-
   Centric Networks (ICN), Content Delivery Networks (CDN), and cloud
   networks use overlay networks within their paths (or links).  The
   underlay networks that support overlay networks can be attacked by
   DDoS, thereby saturating access links or links within the network.
   DoS or DDoS attacks on the access links may also cause the overlay
   nodes' CPUs or links to be saturated by DoS or DDoS traffic which
   will prevent these links from being used by legitimate overlay
   traffic.  Overlay security solutions do not address underlay security
   threats so there is a need for a distributed solution to prevent DDoS
   attacks from spreading throughout overlay and underlay networks.
   Such solution may for example rely upon the dynamic, highly-reactive,
   enforcement of security filtering policies network-wise.

   Similar to traditional networks placing a firewall or Intrusion
   Prevention System (IPS) on the wire to enforce traffic rules, the
   interface to network security functions (I2NSF) can be used by
   overlay networks to request underlay networks enforce certain flow-
   based security rules.  Using this mechanism, the overlay network can

5.  Management Considerations

   o  Lifecycle managment and resource management of NSFs,

   o  Device configuration, such as address configuration, device
      internal attributes configuration, etc.;

   o  Signaling, and

   o  Policy rule provisioning.

   I2NSF will only focus on the policy provisioning part of NSF
   management.

6.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA considerations exist for this document.

7.  Security Considerations

   Having a secure access to control and monitor NSFs is crucial for
   hosted security services.  An I2NSF security controller raises new
   security threats.  It needs to be resilient to attacks and quickly
   recover from attacks.  Therefore, proper secure communication
   channels have to be carefully specified for carrying controlling and
   monitoring traffic between the NSFs and their management entity (or
   entities).

   In addition, the Flow security policies specified by customers can
   conflict with providers' internal security policies which may allow
   unauthorized traffic or unauthorized changes to flow polices (e.g.
   customers changing flow policies that do not belong to them).
   Therefore, it is crucial to have proper AAA to authorize access to
   the network and access to the I2NSF management stream.
