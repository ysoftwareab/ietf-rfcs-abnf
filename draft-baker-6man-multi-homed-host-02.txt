                 Host routing in a multi-prefix network
                  draft-baker-6man-multi-homed-host-02

Abstract

   This note describes expected host behavior in a network that has more
   than one prefix, each allocated by an upstream network that
   implements BCP 38 filtering, when the host has multiple routers to
   choose from.

   This may interact with source address selection in a given
   implementation, but logically follows it - given that the network or
   host is or appears to be multihomed with PA addresses, the host has
   elected to use source address in a given prefix, and some but not all
   neighboring routers are advertising that prefix in their RA PIOs, to
   which router should a host present its transmission?

1.  Introduction

   This note describes the expected behavior of an IPv6 [RFC2460] host
   in a network that has more than one prefix, each allocated by an
   upstream network that implements BCP 38 [RFC2827] filtering, and in
   which the host is presented with a choice of routers.  It expects
   that the network will implement some form of egress routing, so that
   packets sent to a host outside the local network from a given ISP's
   prefix will go to that ISP.  If the packet is sent to the wrong
   egress, it is liable to be discarded by the BCP 38 filter.  However,
   the mechanics of egress routing once the packet leaves the host are
   out of scope.  The question here is how the host interacts with that
   network.

   Note that, apart from ensuring that a message with a given source
   address is given to a first-hop router that appears to know about the
   prefix in question, this specification provides no new guidance over
   that in [RFC4861].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Sending context expected by the host

2.1.  Expectations the host has of the network

   A host receives prefixes in a Router Advertisement [RFC4861], which
   goes on to identify whether they are usable by SLAAC [RFC4862]
   [RFC4941] [RFC7217].  When no prefixes are usable for SLAAC, the
   Router Advertisement would normally signal the availability of DHCPv6
   [RFC3315] and the host would use it to configure its addresses.  In
   the latter case (or if both SLAAC and DHCPv6 are used on the same
   link for some reason) it will be generally the case that the
   configured addresses match one of the prefixes advertised in a Router
   Advertisement that are supposed to be in that link.

   The simplest multihomed network implementation in which a host makes
   choices among routers might be a LAN with one or more hosts on it and
   two or more routers, one for each upstream network, or a host that is
   served by disjoint networks on separate interfaces.  In such a
   network, especially the latter, there is not necessarily a routing
   protocol, and the two routers may not even know that the other is a
   router as opposed to a host, or may be configured to ignore its
   presence.  One might expect that the routers may or may not receive
   each other's RAs and form an address in the other router's prefix
   (which is not per [RFC4862], but is implemented by some stub router
   implementations).  However, all hosts in such a network might be
   expected to create an address in each prefix so advertised.

                       Figure 1: Two simple networks

   If there is no routing protocol among those routers, there is no
   mechanism by which packets can be deterministically forwarded between
   the routers (as described in BCP 84 [RFC3704]) in order to avoid BCP
   38 filters.  Even if there was routing, it would result in an
   indirect route, rather than a direct route originating with the host;
   this is not "wrong", but can be inefficient.  Therefore the host
   would do well to select the appropriate router itself.

   Since the host derives fundamental default routing information from
   the Router Advertisement, this implies that, in any network with
   hosts using multiple prefixes, each prefix SHOULD be advertised via a
   Prefix Information Option (PIO) [RFC4861] by one of the attached
   routers, even if addresses are being assigned using DHCPv6.  A router
   that advertises a prefix indicates that it is able to appropriately
   route packets with source addresses within that prefix, regardless of
   the setting of the L and A flags in the PIO.  In some circumstances
   both L and A might be zero.

2.2.  Expectations of multihomed networks

   The direct implication of Section 2.1 is that routing protocols used
   in multihomed networks SHOULD be capable of source-prefix based
   egress routing, and that multihomed networks SHOULD deploy them.

3.  Reasonable expectations of the host

   Modern hosts maintain a fair bit of history, in terms of what has
   historically worked or not worked for a given address or prefix and
   in some cases the effective window and MSS values for TCP or other

   protocols.  This includes a next hop address for use when a packet is
   sent to the indicated address.

   When a host makes a successful exchange with a remote destination
   using a particular source address, and the host has received a PIO
   that matches that source address in an RA, then the host SHOULD
   include the prefix in such history, whatever the setting of the L and
   A flags in the PIO.  On subsequent attempts to communicate with that
   destination, if it has an address in that prefix at that time, a host
   MAY use an address in the remembered prefix for the session.

   Default Router Selection is modified as follows: A host SHOULD select
   default routers for each prefix it is assigned an address in.
   Routers that have advertised the prefix in its Router Advertisement
   message SHOULD be preferred over routers that do not advertise the
   prefix.

   As a result of doing so, when a host sends a packet using a source
   address in one of those prefixes and has no history directing it
   otherwise, it SHOULD send it to the indicated default router.  In the
   "simplest" network described in Section 2.1, that would get it to the
   only router that is directly capable of getting it to the right ISP.
   This will also apply in more complex networks, even when more than
   one physical or virtual interface is involved.

   In more complex cases, wherein routers advertise RAs for multiple
   prefixes whether or not they have direct or isolated upstream
   connectivity, the host is dependent on the routing system already.
   If the host gives the packet to a router advertising its source
   prefix, it should be able to depend on the router to do the right
   thing.

   There is an interaction with Default Address Selection [RFC6724].
   Rule 5.5 of that specification states that the source address used to
   send to a given destination address should if possible be chosen from
   a prefix known to be advertised by the first-hop router for that
   destination.  This selection rule would be applicable in a host
   following the recommendation in the previous paragraph.

   There is potential for adverse interaction with any off-link Redirect
   (Redirect for a GUA destination that is not on-link) message sent by
   a router in accordance with Section 8 of [RFC4861].  Hosts SHOULD
   apply off-link redirects only for the specific pair of source and
   destination addresses concerned, so the host's Destination Cache may
   need to contain appropriate source-specific entries.

4.  Residual issues

   In a network where routers on a link run a routing protocol and are
   configured with the same information.  That is on each link all
   routers advertise all prefixes on the link, the assumption that
   packets will be forwarded to the appropriate egress by the local
   routing system might cause at least one extra hop in the local
   network (from the host to the wrong router, and from there to another
   router on the same link).

   In a slightly more complex situation such as the disjoint LAN case of
   Figure 1, which happens to be one of the authors' home plus corporate
   home-office configuration, the two upstream routers might be on
   different LANs and therefore different subnets (e.g., the host is
   itself multi-homed).  In that case, there is no way for the "wrong"
   router to detect the existence of the "right" router, or to route to
   it.

   In such a case it is particularly important that hosts take the
   responsibility to memorize and select the best first-hop as described
   in Section 3.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo asks the IANA for no new parameters.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not create any new security or privacy exposures.

   There might be a small privacy improvement, however: with the current
   practice, a multihomed host that sends packets with the wrong address
   to an upstream router or network discloses the prefix of one upstream
   to the other upstream network.  This practice reduces the probability
   of that occurrence.
