Internet-Draft         The IETF Process: a Roadmap         February 2006


1.  Introduction

   BCP 9 [RFC2026] has been the basis for the IETF standards process for
   many years.  However, many other process documents exist, some of
   which are partial updates to BCP 9.  This situation is confusing and
   would ideally be resolved by a clear set of interlocking documents.
   The present document suggests a structured way of looking at the
   existing documents, and mentions some (but not all) drafts covering
   possible changes and updates.

   It is difficult to linearise a complicated and interlocked process.
   This document presents the roadmap in one particular order, but that
   is not intended to imply priority or importance, and it cannot
   capture all interactions between components.


2.  Outline of roadmap

   For readability of what follows, this section simply lists the
   process document structure.  The following section repeats this
   structure with explanatory text.

      Modifying the process
      General description of workflow in the IETF
      Definition of standards track and related document types
         Specifications
         Information
         Descriptors
      Intellectual Property
         Rights in Contributions
         Rights in Technology
         Trademarks
      Review and approval process
         Criteria for review
         Criteria for approval
            Appeal process
      Bodies involved in the process
         WG procedures
         IESG
         Review panel TBD
         IAB
            Liaison management
         Nomcom
      Conduct of participants
      Publication process
         Requirements

3.  Details of roadmap

   Note 1: RFC numbers have been used rather than BCP numbers, for
   convenient lookup.  Most of the cited RFCs are BCPs.  Of course, many
   of them may need updating.

   Note 2: Where drafts are cited, it is not implied that they have
   reached consensus.  Drafts are cited by filename only; the curious
   may consult http://tools.ietf.org/id/ .

   o  Modifying the process
      A general description of how the IETF modifies its own processes
      does not exist, but probably should.  An experimental procedure is
      described in [RFC3933].  Some recent discussion is captured in
      draft-davies-pesci-initial-considerations.
   o  General description of workflow in the IETF
      This document does not exist, although the Tao ([RFC3160],
      draft-hoffman-taobis) offers contains most of it informally.
      How ideas for new work enter the IETF, reach a BOF
      (draft-narten-successful-bof), enter IAB or IRTF discussion, and
      possibly become material for a new or existing WG.  How WGs are
      chartered - the Area Director's role.  How specific proposals
      become drafts and flow through the development, review and
      approval process.

   o  Definition of standards track and related document types.
      This material is currently embedded in [RFC2026].  Additional
      requirements for routing protocols are defined in [RFC1264], being
      updated by draft-fenner-zinin-rtg-standard-reqts.  The newtrk WG
      is chartered to revise the standards track - multiple proposals
      have been floated, most recently draft-carpenter-newtrk-twostep
      and draft-loughney-newtrk-one-size-fits-all.
      *  Specifications
         This material is currently embedded in [RFC2026], covering
         standards track, BCP and experimental documents.  The STD
         (standard) designation is documented in [RFC1311].  A variance
         procedure for down-level normative references is in [RFC3967].

Internet-Draft         The IETF Process: a Roadmap         February 2006


         A specific process for advancing MIB documents is in [RFC2438].
      *  Information
         This material is currently embedded in [RFC2026], covering
         informational and historic documents.  A distinction between
         obsolete and deprecated documents is not currently made.
      *  Descriptors
         See draft-ietf-newtrk-repurposing-isd and
         draft-otis-newtrk-rfc-set.

   o  Intellectual Property
      *  Rights in Contributions
         [RFC3978], draft-ietf-ipr-rules-update
      *  Rights in Technology [RFC3979] (Guidelines, [RFC3669])
      *  Trademarks
         draft-ietf-ipr-trademarks
      *  IETF Trust [RFC4371]

   o  Review and approval process
      This material is currently embedded in [RFC2026].
      *  Criteria for review
         Some material was in draft-carpenter-solution-sirs and a
         version can be found at
         http://www.alvestrand.no/ietf/gen/art/review-guidelines.html
      *  Criteria for approval
         Material on current IESG practice can be found in
         draft-iesg-discuss-criteria
         +  Appeal process
            This material is currently embedded in [RFC2026].

   o  Bodies involved in the process
      Bodies involved [RFC2028]; Defining the IETF [RFC3233]; Mission
      Statement [RFC3935].
      *  WG procedures [RFC2418]
      *  IESG [RFC3710]
      *  Proposed review panel
         draft-klensin-stds-review-panel
      *  IAB [RFC2850]
         +  Liaison management
            [RFC4052], [RFC4053], draft-iab-liaison-guidelines
      *  Nomcom [RFC3777] , draft-klensin-nomcom-term
      *  Relationship to ISOC
         [RFC2031], [RFC3677]

   o  Conduct of participants
      [RFC3005], [RFC3184], [RFC3683], [RFC3934], and also discussed in
      [RFC2418] and in the Tao ([RFC3160], draft-hoffman-taobis).

   o  Publication process
      *  Requirements

         writing standards will find the following especially useful:
         [RFC2360], [RFC2434], [RFC3552].
