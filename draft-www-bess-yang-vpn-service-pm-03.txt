    A YANG Model for Network and VPN Service Performance Monitoring
                 draft-www-bess-yang-vpn-service-pm-03

Abstract

   The data model defined in [RFC8345] introduces vertical layering
   relationships between networks that can be augmented to cover
   network/service topologies.  This document defines a YANG model for
   Network and VPN Service Performance Monitoring that can be used to
   monitor and manage network performance on the topology at different
   layer or the overlay topology between VPN sites.  This model is an
   augmentation to the network topology YANG data model defined in
   [RFC8345].

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8345] defines an abstract YANG data model for network/service
   topologies and inventories.  Service topology in [RFC8345] includes
   the a virtual topology for a service layer above the L1, L2, and L3
   layers.  This virtual topology has the generic topology elements of
   node, link, and terminating point.  One typical example of a service
   topology is described in figure 3 of [RFC8345], two VPN service
   topologies instantiated over a common L3 topology.  Each VPN service
   topology is mapped onto a subset of nodes from the common L3
   topology.

   In [RFC8299], 3 types of VPN service topologies are defined for the
   L3VPN service data model: any to any; hub and spoke; and hub and

   spoke disjoint.  These VPN topology types can be used to describe how
   VPN sites communicate with each other.

   This document defines a YANG Model for Network performance monitoring
   and VPN Service Performance Monitoring that can be used to monitor
   and manage network Performance on the topology at different layer or
   the overlay topology between VPN sites and it is an augmentation to
   the network topology YANG data model defined in [RFC8345].

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  In this
   document, these words will appear with that interpretation only when
   in ALL CAPS.  Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying [RFC2119] significance.

2.1.  Tree Diagrams

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

3.  Network and VPN service assurance model

   This module describes Network and VPN Service assurance that can be
   used to monitor and manage the network Performance in the underlying
   network or between VPN sites and it is a augmentation to the "ietf-
   network" and "ietf-network-topology" YANG data model [RFC8345].  The
   performance monitoring data is augmented to service topology.

4.  Layering relationship between underlay topology and overlay topology

   The data model defined in [RFC8345] can describe vertical layering
   relationships between networks.  That model can be augmented to cover
   network/service topologies.  Figure 1 describes an example on
   layering relationship between L3 topology and the Optical topology:

     Example of Layering relationship between the L3 Topology and the
                             Optical topology

   The "L3" topology shows network elements at Layer 3 (IP), and the
   "Optical" topology shows network elements at Layer 1.  Network
   elements in the "L3" topology are mapped onto network elements in the
   "Optical" topology.

   Figure 2 describes another example on relationships between the L3VPN
   service topology and the underlying network:

Internet-Draft       Network and VPN Service PM YANG           July 2019


   As shown in Figure 2, Site-1A, Site-1B, and Site-1C are mapped to
   nodes 1, 2, and 3, while Site-2A, Site-2B, and Site-2C are mapped to
   nodes 4, 5, and 6 in the underlying physical network.  In this
   figure, a L3VPN Service Model (L3SM) [RFC8299] has two VPN services
   topologies with both built on top of one common underlying physical
   network.

      VPN-SVC 1: supporting hub-spoke communication for Customer 1
      connecting the customers access at 3 sites

      VPN-SVC 2: supporting hub-spoke disjoint communication for
      Customer 2 connecting the customers access at 3 sites

   L3VPN service topology 1 is hub and spoke topology while L3VPN
   service topology 2 is hub and spoke disjoint topology.  In L3VPN
   service topology 1, Site-1 A plays the role of hub while Site-2 B and
   C plays the role of spoke.  In L3VPN service topoogy 2, Site-2 A and
   B play the role of hub while Site-2 C plays the role of spoke.

5.  Model Usage Guideline

   An SP must be able to manage the capabilities and characteristics of
   their Network/VPN services when Network connection is established or
   VPN sites are setup to communicate with each other.  Network and VPN
   service topology such as hub and spoke describes how these VPN sites
   are communicating with each other.

5.1.  Performance Monitoring Data Source

   As described in section 2, once the mapping between overlay network
   topology/VPN Service topology and underlying physical network has
   been setup, the performance monitoring data per link in the
   underlying network can be collected using network performance
   measurement method such as MPLS Loss and Delay Measurement [RFC6374].
   The performance monitoring information reflecting the quality of the
   Network or VPN service such as end to end network performance data
   between source node and destination node in the network or between
   VPN sites can be aggregated or calculated using PCEP solution
   [RFC5440] or LMAP solution [RFC8194].  The information can be fed
   into data source such as the management system or network devices.
   The measurement interval and report interval associated with these
   performance data usually depends on configuration parameters.

5.2.  Retrieval via I2RS Pub/Sub [RFC7923]

   Some applications such as service-assurance applications, which must
   maintain a continuous view of operational data and state, can use
   subscription model [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] to subscribe to the



Wang, et al.             Expires January 6, 2020                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       Network and VPN Service PM YANG           July 2019


   Network and VPN service performance data they are interested in, at
   the data source.

   The data source can then use the Network and VPN service assurance
   model defined in this document and push model [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-
   push] to publish specific telemetry data to target recipients.

5.3.  On demand Retrieval via RPC model

   To obtain a snapshot of a large amount of performance data from the
   network element, service-assurance applications can also use polling
   based solution such as RPC model to fetch performance data on demand.

6.  Design of the Data Model

   This document defines the YANG module "ietf-network-vpn-svc-pm",
   which has the following structure

6.1.  Network Level

   module: ietf-network-vpn-svc-pm
     augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:network-types:
       +--rw svc-topo-type?   identityref
     augment /nw:networks/nw:network:
       +--rw svc-topo-attributes
          +--rw vpn-topo?   identityref

                   Network Level View of the hierarchies

   For VPN service performance monitoring, this model defines only the
   following minimal set of Network level service topology attributes:

   o  svc-topo-type: Indicate the network type is service topology type
      such as L3VPN service topology, L2VPN service topology.

   o  vpn-topo: The type of VPN service topology, this model supports
      any-to-any, Hub and Spoke (where Hubs can exchange traffic), and
      "Hub and Spoke disjoint" (where Hubs cannot exchange traffic).

   For network performance monitoring, the attributes of "Network Level"
   that defined in [RFC8345] do not need to be extended.

6.2.  Node Level

          +--rw site-role?   Identityref

                    Node Level View of the hierarchies

   The Network and VPN service performance monitoring model defines only
   the following minimal set of Node level service topology attributes
   and constraints:

   o  Node-type (Attribute): Indicate the type of the node, such as PE
      or ASBR.

   o  Site-id (Constraint): Uniquely identifies the site within the
      overall network infrastructure.

   o  Site-role (Constraint): Defines the role of the site in a
      particular VPN topology.

         Link and Termination point Level View of the hierarchies

   The Network and VPN service performance monitoring model defines only
   the following minimal set of Link level service topology attributes:

      Loss Statistics: A set of loss statistics attributes that are used
      to measure end to end loss between VPN sites.

      Delay Statistics: A set of delay statistics attributes that are
      used to measure end to end latency between VPN sites.

      Jitter Statistics: A set of jitter statistics attributes that are
      used to measure end to end jitter between VPN sites.

Internet-Draft       Network and VPN Service PM YANG           July 2019


   The Network and VPN service performance monitoring defines the
   following minimal set of Termination point level service topology
   attributes:

      Inbound statistics: A set of inbound statistics attributes that
      are used to measure the inbound statistics of the termination
      point, such as "the total number of octets received on the
      termination point", "The number of inbound packets which were
      chosen to be discarded", "The number of inbound packets that
      contained errors", etc.

      Outbound statistics: A set of outbound statistics attributes that
      are used to measure the outbound statistics of the termination
      point, such as "the total number of octets transmitted out of the
      termination point", "The number of outbound packets which were
      chosen to be discarded", "The number of outbound packets that
      contained errors", etc.

7.  Example of I2RS Pub/Sub Retrieval [RFC7923]

   This example shows the way for a client to subscribe for the
   Performance monitoring information between node A and node B in the
   L3 network topology built on top of the underlying optical network .
   The performance monitoring parameter that the client is interested in
   is end to end loss attribute.

8.  Example of RPC model based Retrieval

   This example shows the way for the client to use RPC model to fetch
   performance data on demand,e.g., the client requests packet-loss-
   count between PE1 in site 1 and PE2 in site 2 belonging to VPN1.

10.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this document MAY be accessed via the
   RESTCONF protocol [RFC8040] or NETCONF protocol ([RFC6241]).  The
   lowest RESTCONF or NETCONF layer requires that the transport-layer
   protocol provides both data integrity and confidentiality, see

   Section 2 in [RFC8040] and [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is
   the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH)[RFC6242] . The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /nw:networks/nw:network/svc-topo:svc-telemetry-attributes

   o  /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/svc-topo:node-attributes
