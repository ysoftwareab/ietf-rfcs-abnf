<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document describes requirements for a protocol to negotiate a
      security context for SIP-signaled SRTP media. In addition to the natural
      security requirements, this negotiation protocol must interoperate well
      with SIP in certain ways. A number of proposals have been published and
      a summary of these proposals is in the appendix of this document.

Introduction</h3>

<p>The work on media security started when the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP) was still in its infancy. With the increased SIP
      deployment and the availability of new SIP extensions and related
      protocols, the need for end-to-end security was re-evaluated. The
      procedure of re-evaluating prior protocol work and design decisions is
      not an uncommon strategy and, to some extent, considered necessary to
      ensure that the developed protocols indeed meet the previously
      envisioned needs for the users on the Internet.
</p>
<p>This document summarizes media security requirements, i.e.,
      requirements for mechanisms that negotiate security context such as
      cryptographic keys and parameters for SRTP.
</p>
<p>The organization of this document is as follows: <a class='info' href='#terminology'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Terminology</span><span>)</span></a> introduces terminology, <a class='info' href='#attack_scenarios'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Attack Scenarios</span><span>)</span></a> describes various attack scenarios
      against the signaling path and media path, <a class='info' href='#scenarios'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Call Scenarios and Requirements Considerations</span><span>)</span></a> provides an overview about possible call
      scenarios, <a class='info' href='#requirements'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Requirements</span><span>)</span></a> lists requirements for
      media security. The main part of the document concludes with the
      security considerations <a class='info' href='#security'>Section&nbsp;6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Security Considerations</span><span>)</span></a>, IANA
      considerations <a class='info' href='#iana'>Section&nbsp;7<span> (</span><span class='info'>IANA Considerations</span><span>)</span></a> and an acknowledgement
      section in <a class='info' href='#acks'>Section&nbsp;8<span> (</span><span class='info'>Acknowledgements</span><span>)</span></a>. <a class='info' href='#comparison'>Appendix&nbsp;A<span> (</span><span class='info'>Overview and Evaluation of Existing Keying Mechanisms</span><span>)</span></a> lists and compares available solution
      proposals. The following <a class='info' href='#eval-sip'>Appendix&nbsp;A.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Evaluation Criteria - SIP</span><span>)</span></a> compares the
      different approaches regarding their suitability for the SIP signaling
      scenarios described in <a class='info' href='#comparison'>Appendix&nbsp;A<span> (</span><span class='info'>Overview and Evaluation of Existing Keying Mechanisms</span><span>)</span></a>, while <a class='info' href='#eval-sec'>Appendix&nbsp;A.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Evaluation Criteria - Security</span><span>)</span></a> provides a comparison regarding security
      aspects. <a class='info' href='#ofs'>Appendix&nbsp;B<span> (</span><span class='info'>Out-of-Scope</span><span>)</span></a> lists non-goals for this
      document.

Terminology</h3>

<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <a class='info' href='#RFC2119'>[RFC2119]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a>, with the important qualification that, unless
      otherwise stated, these terms apply to the design of the media security
      key management protocol, not its implementation or application.
</p>
<p>Additionally, the following items are used in this document:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>AOR (Address-of-Record): </dt>
<dd>A SIP or SIPS URI that
          points to a domain with a location service that can map the URI to
          another URI where the user might be available. Typically, the
          location service is populated through registrations. An AOR is
          frequently thought of as the "public address" of the user.
</dd>
<dt>SSRC:</dt>
<dd>The 32-bit value that defines the
          synchronization source, used in RTP. These are generally unique, but
          collisions can occur.
</dd>
<dt>two-time pad:</dt>
<dd>The use of the same key and the same
          keystream to encrypt different data. For SRTP, a two-time pad occurs
          if two senders are using the same key and the same RTP SSRC
          value.
</dd>
<dt>Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS):</dt>
<dd>The property that
          disclosure of the long-term secret keying material that is used to
          derive an agreed ephemeral key does not compromise the secrecy of
          agreed keys from earlier runs.
</dd>
<dt>active adversary:</dt>
<dd>An active adversary is able to alter
          data communication to affect its operation (see also <a class='info' href='#RFC4949'>[RFC4949]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shirey, R., &ldquo;Internet Security Glossary, Version 2,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>).
</dd>
<dt>passive adversary:</dt>
<dd>A passive adversary is able to
          learn information from data communication, but not alter that data
          communication (see also<a class='info' href='#RFC4949'>[RFC4949]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shirey, R., &ldquo;Internet Security Glossary, Version 2,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>).
</dd>
<dt>signaling path:</dt>
<dd>The signaling path is the route taken

          is defined by a quartet of IP addresses and TCP/UDP ports, along
          with an IP route. In other cases, this path may include RTP relays,

Attack Scenarios</h3>

<p>The discussion in this section relates to requirements R-PASS-MEDIA,
      R-PASS-SIG, R-ASSOC, R-SIG-MEDIA, R-ACT-ACT, and R-ID-BINDING.
</p>
<p>This document classifies adversaries according to their access and
      their capabilities. An adversary might have access:</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>only to the media path,
</li>
<li>only to the signaling path,
</li>
<li>to the media path and to the signaling path.
</li>
</ol>

<p>An attacker that can solely be located along the signaling path, and
      does not have access to media (item 2), is not considered in this
      document.
</p>
<p>There are two different types of adversaries, active and passive. An
      active adversary may need to be active with regard to the key exchange
      relevant information traveling along the media path or traveling along
      the signaling path.
</p>
<p>Based on their robustness against the adversary capabilities
      described above, we can group security mechanisms using the following
      labels. This list is generally ordered from easiest to compromise (at
      the top) to more difficult to compromise:

<p>For example, unencrypted RTP is vulnerable to

</p>
<p>As another example, <a class='info' href='#RFC4568'>Security
      Descriptions<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andreasen, F., Baugher, M., and D. Wing, &ldquo;Session Description Protocol (SDP) Security Descriptions for Media Streams,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4568], when protected by TLS (as it is commonly
      implemented and deployed), belongs in the
      passive-signaling-passive-media category since the adversary needs to
      learn the Security Descriptions key by seeing the SIP signaling message
      at a SIP proxy (assuming that the adversary is in control of the SIP
      proxy). The media traffic can be decrypted using that learned key.
</p>
<p>As another example, DTLS-SRTP falls into
      active-signaling-active-media category when DTLS-SRTP is used with a
      public key based ciphersuite with self-signed certificates and without
      <a class='info' href='#RFC4474'>SIP-Identity<span> (</span><span class='info'>Peterson, J. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4474]. An adversary would have to
      modify the fingerprint that is sent along the signaling path and
      subsequently to modify the certificates carried in the DTLS handshake
      that travel along the media path. If DTLS-SRTP is used with both <a class='info' href='#RFC4474'>SIP Identity<span> (</span><span class='info'>Peterson, J. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4474] and <a class='info' href='#RFC4916'>SIP
      Connected Identity<span> (</span><span class='info'>Elwell, J., &ldquo;Connected Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4916], the RFC4474 signature protects both the offer
      and the answer, and such a system would then belong to the
      active-signaling-active-attack-detect category (provided, of course, the
      signaling path to the RFC4474 authenticator and verifier is secured as
      per RFC4474 and the RFC4474 authenticator and verifier are behaving as
      per RFC4474).
</p>
<p>The above discussion of DTLS-SRTP demonstrates how a single security
      protocol can be in different classes depending on the mode in which it
      is operated. Other protocols can achieve similar effect by adding
      functions outside of the on-the-wire key management protocol itself.
      Although it may be appropriate to deploy lower-classed mechanisms in
      some cases, the ultimate security requirement for a media security
      negotiation protocol is that it have a mode of operation available in
      which is detect-attack, which provides protection against the passive
      and active attacks and provides detection of such attacks. That is,
      there must be a way to use the protocol so that an active attack is
      required against both the signaling and media paths, and so that such
      attacks are detectable by the endpoints.

Clipping Media Before Signaling Answer</h3>

<p>The discussion in this section relates to requirement
        R-AVOID-CLIPPING and R-ALLOW-RTP.
</p>
<p>Per the SDP Offer/Answer Model <a class='info' href='#RFC3264'>[RFC3264]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>,
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>"Once the offerer has sent the offer, it MUST be prepared to
            receive media for any recvonly streams described by that offer. It
            MUST be prepared to send and receive media for any sendrecv
            streams in the offer, and send media for any sendonly streams in
            the offer (of course, it cannot actually send until the peer
            provides an answer with the needed address and port
            information)."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To meet this requirement with SRTP, the offerer needs to know the
        SRTP key for arriving media. If either endpoint receives encrypted
        media before it has access to the associated SRTP key, it cannot play
        the media -- causing clipping.
</p>
<p>For key exchange mechanisms that send the answerer's key in SDP, a
        SIP provisional response <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E.

        (session progress), is useful. However, the 183 messages are not
        reliable unless both the calling and called end point support PRACK
        <a class='info' href='#RFC3262'>[RFC3262]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;Reliability of Provisional Responses in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, use TCP across all SIP proxies,
        implement Security Preconditions <a class='info' href='#RFC5027'>[RFC5027]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andreasen, F. and D. Wing, &ldquo;Security Preconditions for Session Description Protocol (SDP) Media Streams,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, or
        the both ends implement ICE <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>
        and the answerer implements the reliable provisional response
        mechanism described in ICE. Unfortunately, there is not wide
        deployment of any of these techniques and there is industry reluctance
        to require these techniques to avoid the problems described in this
        section.
</p>
<p>Note that the receipt of an SDP answer is not always sufficient to
        allow media to be played to the offerer. Sometimes, the offerer must
        send media in order to open up firewall holes or NAT bindings before
        media can be received (for details see <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-media-path-middleboxes'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;media&#8209;path&#8209;middleboxes]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stucker, B. and H. Tschofenig, &ldquo;Analysis of Middlebox Interactions for Signaling Protocol Communication  along the Media Path,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>). In this
        case, even a solution that makes the key available before the SDP
        answer arrives will not help.
</p>
<p>Preventing the arrival of early media (i.e., media that arrives at
        the SDP offerer before the SDP answer arrives) might obsolete the
        R-AVOID-CLIPPING requirement, but at the time of writing such early
        media exists in many normal call scenarios.

Retargeting and Forking</h3>

<p>The discussion in this section relates to requirements
        R-FORK-RETARGET, R-DISTINCT, R-HERFP, and R-BEST-SECURE.
</p>
<p>In SIP, a request sent to a specific AOR but delivered to a
        different AOR is called a "retarget". A typical scenario is a "call
        forwarding" feature. In <a class='info' href='#retargeting_figure'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Retargeting</span><span>)</span></a>
        Alice sends an INVITE in step 1 that is sent to Bob in step 2. Bob
        responds with a redirect (SIP response code 3xx) pointing to Carol in
        step 3. This redirect typically does not propagate back to Alice but
        only goes to a proxy (i.e., the retargeting proxy) that sends the
        original INVITE to Carol in step 4.

</p>
<p>Using retargeting might lead to situations where the UAC does not
        know where its request will be going. This might not immediately seem
        like a serious problem; after all, when one places a telephone call on
        the PSTN, one never really knows if it will be forwarded to a
        different number, who will pick up the line when it rings, and so on.
        However, when considering SIP mechanisms for authenticating the called
        party, this function can also make it difficult to differentiate an
        intermediary that is behaving legitimately from an attacker. From this
        perspective, the main problems with retargeting ares:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Not detectable by the caller: </dt>
<dd>The originating user
            agent has no means of anticipating that the condition will arise,
            nor any means of determining that it has occurred until the call
            has already been set up.
</dd>
<dt>Not preventable by the caller:</dt>
<dd>There is no existing
            mechanism that might be employed by the originating user agent in
            order to guarantee that the call will not be re-targeted.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>The mechanism used by SIP for identifying the calling party is SIP
        Identity <a class='info' href='#RFC4474'>[RFC4474]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Peterson, J. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. However, due to the nature of
        retargeting SIP Identity can only identify the calling party (that is,
        the party that initiated the SIP request). Some key exchange
        mechanisms predate SIP Identity and include their own identity
        mechanism (e.g., MIKEY). However, those built-in identity mechanism
        also suffer from the SIP retargeting problem. While <a class='info' href='#RFC4916'>Connected Identity<span> (</span><span class='info'>Elwell, J., &ldquo;Connected Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4916] allows positive
        identification of the called party, the primary difficulty still
        remains that the calling party does not know if a mismatched called
        party is legitimate (i.e., due to authorized retargeting) or
        illegitimate (i.e., due to unauthorized retargeting by an attacker
        above to modify SIP signaling).
</p>
<p>In SIP, 'forking' is the delivery of a request to multiple
        locations. This happens when a single AOR is registered more than
        once. An example of forking is when a user has a desk phone, PC
        client, and mobile handset all registered with the same AOR.

</p>
<p>With forking, both Bob-1 and Bob-2 might send back SDP answers in
        SIP responses. Alice will see those intermediate (18x) and final (200)
        responses. It is useful for Alice to be able to associate the SIP
        response with the incoming media stream. Although this association can
        be done with ICE <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, and ICE
        is useful to make this association with RTP, it is not desirable to
        require ICE to accomplish this association.
</p>
<p>Forking and retargeting are often used together. For example, a
        boss and secretary might have both phones ring (forking) and rollover
        to voice mail if neither phone is answered (retargeting).
</p>
<p>To maintain security of the media traffic, only the end point that
        answers the call should know the SRTP keys for the session. Forked and
        re-targeted calls only reveal sensitive information to non-responders
        when the signaling messages contain sensitive information (e.g., SRTP
        keys) that is accessible by parties that receive the offer, but may
        not respond (i.e., the original recipients in a retargeted call, or
        non-answering endpoints in a forked call). For key exchange mechanisms
        that do not provide secure forking or secure retargeting, one
        workaround is to re-key immediately after forking or retargeting.
        However, because the originator may not be aware that the call forked
        this mechanism requires rekeying immediately after every session is
        established. This doubles the number of messages processed by the
        network.
</p>
<p>Further compounding this problem is a unique feature of SIP that
        when forking is used, there is always only one final error response
        delivered to the sender of the request: the forking proxy is
        responsible for choosing which final response to choose in the event
        where forking results in multiple final error responses being received
        by the forking proxy. This means that if a request is rejected, say
        with information that the keying information was rejected and
        providing the far end's credentials, it is very possible that the
        rejection will never reach the sender. This problem, called the <a class='info' href='#RFC3326'>Heterogeneous Error Response Forking Problem
        (HERFP)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Oran, D., and G. Camarillo, &ldquo;The Reason Header Field for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3326], is difficult to solve in SIP. Because we expect the
        HERFP to continue to be a problem in SIP for the foreseeable future, a
        media security system should function even in the presence of HERFP
        behavior.

Recording</h3>

<p>The discussion in this section relates to requirement
        R-RECORDING.
</p>
<p>Some business environments, such as stock brokers, banks, and
        catalog call centers, require recording calls with customers. This is
        the familiar "this call is being recorded for quality purposes" heard
        during calls to these sorts of businesses. In these environments,
        media recording is typically performed by an intermediate device (with
        RTP, this is typically implemented in a 'sniffer').
</p>
<p>When performing such call recording with SRTP, the end-to-end
        security is compromised. This is unavoidable, but necessary because
        the operation of the business requires such recording. It is desirable
        that the media security is not unduly compromised by the media
        recording. The endpoint within the organization needs to be informed
        that there is an intermediate device and needs to cooperate with that
        intermediate device.
</p>
<p>This scenario does not place a requirement directly on the key
        management protocol. The requirement could be met directly by the key
        management protocol (e.g., MIKEY-NULL or <a class='info' href='#RFC4568'>[RFC4568]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andreasen, F., Baugher, M., and D.

<p>A typical case of using media security where two entities are
        having a VoIP conversation over IP capable networks. However, there
        are cases where the other end of the communication is not connected to
        an IP capable network. In this kind of setting, there needs to be some
        kind of gateway at the edge of the IP network which converts the VoIP
        conversation to format understood by the other network. An example of
        such gateway is a PSTN gateway sitting at the edge of IP and PSTN
        networks (such as the architecture described in <a class='info' href='#RFC3372'>[RFC3372]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vemuri, A. and J. Peterson, &ldquo;Session Initiation Protocol for Telephones (SIP-T): Context and Architectures,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>).
</p>
<p>If media security (e.g., SRTP protection) is employed in this kind
        of gateway-setting, then media security and the related key management
        is terminated at the PSTN gateway. The other network (e.g., PSTN) may
        have its own measures to protect the communication, but this means
        that from media security point of view the media security is not
        employed truely end-to-end between the communicating entities.

Call Setup Performance</h3>

<p>The discussion in this section relates to requirement R-REUSE.
</p>
<p>Some devices lack sufficient processing power to perform public key
        operations or Diffie-Hellman operations for each call, or prefer to
        avoid performing those operations on every call. The ability to re-use
        previous public key or Diffie-Hellman operations can vastly decrease
        the call setup delay and processing requirements for such devices.
</p>
<p>In certain devices, it can take a second or two to perform a
        Diffie-Hellman operation. Examples of these devices include handsets,
        IP Multimedia Services Identity Module (ISIMs), and PSTN gateways.
        PSTN gateways typically utilize a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) which
        is not yet involved with typical DSP operations at the beginning of a
        call, thus the DSP could be used to perform the calculation, so as to
        avoid having the central host processor perform the calculation.
        However, not all PSTN gateways use DSPs (some have only central
        processors or their DSPs are incapable of performing the necessary
        public key or Diffie-Hellman operation), and handsets lack a separate,
        unused processor to perform these operations.
</p>
<p>Two scenarios where R-REUSE is useful are calls between an endpoint
        and its voicemail server or its PSTN gateway. In those scenarios calls
        are made relatively often and it can be useful for the voicemail
        server or PSTN gateway to avoid public key operations for subsequent
        calls.
</p>
<p>Storing keys across sessions often interferes with perfect forward
        secrecy (R-PFS).

Transcoding</h3>

<p>The discussion in this section relates to requirement
        R-TRANSCODER.
</p>
<p>In some environments is is necessary for network equipment to
        transcode from one codec (e.g., a highly compressed codec which makes
        efficient use of wireless bandwidth) to another codec (e.g., a
        standardized codec to a SIP peering interface). With RTP, a
        transcoding function can be performed with the combination of a SIP
        B2BUA (to modify the SDP) and a processor to perform the transcoding
        between the codecs. However, with end-to-end secured SRTP, a
        transcoding function implemented the same way is a man in the middle
        attack, and the key management system prevents its use.
</p>
<p>However, such a network-based transcoder can still be realized with
        the cooperation and approval of the endpoint, and can provide
        end-to-transcoder and transcoder-to-end security.

Upgrading to SRTP</h3>

<p>The discussion in this section relates to the requirement
        R-ALLOW-RTP.
</p>
<p>Legitimate RTP media can be sent to an endpoint for announcements,
        colorful ringback tones (e.g., music), advertising, or normal call
        progress tones. The RTP may be received before an associated SDP
        answer. For details on various scenarios, see <a class='info' href='#I-D.stucker-sipping-early-media-coping'>[I&#8209;D.stucker&#8209;sipping&#8209;early&#8209;media&#8209;coping]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stucker, B., &ldquo;Coping with Early Media in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; October&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>While receiving such RTP exposes the calling party to a risk of
        receiving malicious RTP from an attacker, SRTP endpoints will need to
        receive and play out RTP media in order to be compatible with deployed
        systems that send RTP to calling parties.

Interworking with Other Signaling Protocols</h3>

<p>The discussion in this section relates to the requirement
        R-OTHER-SIGNALING.
</p>
<p>In many environments, some devices are signaled with protocols
        other than SIP which do not share SIP's offer/answer model (e.g.,
        <a class='info' href='#H.248.1'>[H.248.1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>ITU, &ldquo;Gateway control protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> or do not utilize SDP (e.g., H.323). In
        other environments, both endpoints may be SIP, but may use different
        key management systems (e.g., one uses MIKEY-RSA, the other
        MIKEY-RSA-R).
</p>
<p>In these environments, it is desirable to have SRTP -- rather than
        RTP -- between the two endpoints. It is always possible, although
        undesirable, to interwork those disparate signaling systems or
        disparate key management systems by decrypting and re-encrypting each
        SRTP packet in a device in the middle of the network (often the same
        device performing the signaling interworking). This is undesirable due
        to the cost and increased attack area, as such an SRTP/SRTP
        interworking device is a valuable attack target.
</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, interworking is considered important.
        Interworking without decryption/encryption of the SRTP, while useful,
        is not yet deemed critical because the scale of such SRTP deployments
        is, to date, relatively small.

Certificates</h3>

<p>The discussion in this section relates to R-CERTS.
</p>
<p>On the Internet and on some private networks, validating another
        peer's certificate is often done through a trust anchor -- a list of
        Certificate Authorities that are trusted. It can be difficult or
        expensive for a peer to obtain these certificates. In all cases, both
        parties to the call would need to trust the same trust anchor (i.e.,
        "certificate authority"). For these reasons, it is important that
        authentication mechanisms that utilize trust anchors not rely
        exclusively on such Certificate Authority-issued certificates, but to
        also allow self-signed certificates. By allowing the use of such
        self-signed certificates, an out-of-band mechanism (e.g., manual
        configuration) can be used to trust a peer's certificate.

<dd>If SRTP key
            negotiation is performed over the media path (i.e., using the same

            NOT pass the RTP validity check defined in Appendix A.1 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3550'>[RFC3550]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Casner, S., Frederick, R., and V. Jacobson, &ldquo;RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</dd>
<dt>R-ASSOC:</dt>
<dd>The media security
            key management protocol SHOULD include a mechanism for associating
            key management messages with both the signaling traffic that
            initiated the session and with protected media traffic. It is
            useful to associate key management messages with call signaling
            messages, as this allows the SDP offerer to avoid performing
            CPU-consuming operations (e.g., Diffie-Hellman or public key
            operations) with attackers that have not seen the signaling
            messages.<br />
<br />
For example, if using a
            Diffie-Hellman keying technique with security preconditions that
            forks to 20 end points, the call initiator would get 20
            provisional responses containing 20 signed Diffie-Hellman key
            pairs. Calculating 20 Diffie-Hellman secrets and validating
            signatures can be a difficult task for some devices. Hence, in the
            case of forking, it is not desirable to perform a Diffie-Hellman
            operation with every party, but rather only with the party that
            answers the call (and incur some media clipping). To do this, the
            signaling and media need to be associated so the calling party
            knows which key management exchange needs to be completed. This
            might be done by using the transport address indicated in the SDP,
            although NATs can complicate this association.

<a name="rfc.section.A"></a><h3>Appendix A.&nbsp;
Overview and Evaluation of Existing Keying Mechanisms</h3>

<p>Based on how the SRTP keys are exchanged, each SRTP key exchange
      mechanism belongs to one general category:</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>signaling path:</dt>
<dd>All the
          keying is carried in the call signaling (SIP or SDP) path.
</dd>
<dt>media path:</dt>
<dd>All the keying is
          carried in the SRTP/SRTCP media path, and no signaling whatsoever is
          carried in the call signaling path.
</dd>
<dt>signaling and media path:</dt>
<dd>Parts of the keying are carried in the SRTP/SRTCP
          media path, and parts are carried in the call signaling (SIP or SDP)
          path.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>One of the significant benefits of SRTP over other end-to-end
      encryption mechanisms, such as for example IPsec, is that SRTP is
      bandwidth efficient and SRTP retains the header of RTP packets.
      Bandwidth efficiency is vital for VoIP in many scenarios where access
      bandwidth is limited or expensive, and retaining the RTP header is
      important for troubleshooting packet loss, delay, and jitter.
</p>
<p>Related to SRTP's characteristics is a goal that any SRTP keying
      mechanism to also be efficient and not cause additional call setup
      delay. Contributors to additional call setup delay include network or
      database operations: retrieval of certificates and additional SIP or
      media path messages, and computational overhead of establishing keys or
      validating certificates.
</p>
<p>When examining the choice between keying in the signaling path,
      keying in the media path, or keying in both paths, it is important to
      realize the media path is generally 'faster' than the SIP signaling
      path. The SIP signaling path has computational elements involved which
      parse and route SIP messages. The media path, on the other hand, does
      not normally have computational elements involved, and even when
      computational elements such as firewalls are involved, they cause very
      little additional delay. Thus, the media path can be useful for
      exchanging several messages to establish SRTP keys. A disadvantage of
      keying over the media path is that interworking different key exchange
      requires the interworking function be in the media path, rather than
      just in the signaling path; in practice this involvement is probably
      unavoidable anyway.

MIKEY-NULL</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#RFC3830'>MIKEY-NULL<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J., Carrara, E., Lindholm, F., Naslund, M., and K. Norrman, &ldquo;MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3830] has the offerer indicate
          the SRTP keys for both directions. The key is sent unencrypted in
          SDP, which means the SDP must be encrypted hop-by-hop (e.g., by
          using TLS (SIPS)) or end-to-end (e.g., by using S/MIME).
</p>
<p>MIKEY-NULL requires one message from offerer to answerer (half a

Clipping Media Before SDP Answer</h3>

<p>Clipping media before receiving the signaling answer is described
          within <a class='info' href='#clipping'>Section&nbsp;4.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Clipping Media Before Signaling Answer</span><span>)</span></a>. The following builds upon
          this description.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the problem of clipping gets compounded when forking
          is used. For example, if using a Diffie-Hellman keying technique
          with security preconditions that forks to 20 endpoints, the call
          initiator would get 20 provisional responses containing 20 signed
          Diffie-Hellman half keys. Calculating 20 DH secrets and validating
          signatures can be a difficult task depending on the device
          capabilities.

SSRC and ROC</h3>

<p>In SRTP, a cryptographic context is defined as the SSRC,
          destination network address, and destination transport port number.
          Whereas RTP, a flow is defined as the destination network address
          and destination transport port number. This results in a problem --
          how to communicate the SSRC so that the SSRC can be used for the
          cryptographic context.
</p>
<p>Two approaches have emerged for this communication. One, used by
          all MIKEY modes, is to communicate the SSRCs to the peer in the
          MIKEY exchange. Another, used by Security Descriptions, is to use
          "late bindng" -- that is, any new packet containing a
          previously-unseen SSRC (which arrives at the same destination
          network address and destination transport port number) will create a
          new cryptographic context. Another approach, common amongst
          techniques with media-path SRTP key establishment, is to require a
          handshake over that media path before SRTP packets are sent. MIKEY's
          approach changes RTP's SSRC collision detection behavior by
          requiring RTP to pre-establish the SSRC values for each session.
</p>
<p>Another related issue is that SRTP introduces a rollover counter
          (ROC), which records how many times the SRTP sequence number has
          rolled over. As the sequence number is used for SRTP's default
          ciphers, it is important that all endpoints know the value of the
          ROC. The ROC starts at 0 at the beginning of a session.
</p>
<p>Some keying mechanisms cause a two-time pad to occur if two
          endpoints of a forked call have an SSRC collision.
</p>
<p>Note: A proposal has been made to send the ROC value on every Nth
          SRTP packet<a class='info' href='#RFC4771'>[RFC4771]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lehtovirta, V., Naslund, M., and K. Norrman, &ldquo;Integrity Transform Carrying Roll-Over Counter for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP),&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. This proposal has not yet

Distribution and Validation of Persistent Public Keys and Certificates</h3>

<p>Using persistent public keys for confidentiality and
          authentication can introduce requirements for two types of systems,
          often implemented using certificates: (1) a system to distribute
          those persistent public keys certificates, and (2) a system for
          validating those persistent public keys. We refer to the former as a
          key distribution system and the latter as an authentication
          infrastructure. In many cases, a monolithic public key
          infrastructure (PKI) is used for fulfill both of these roles.
          However, these functions can be provided by many other systems. For
          instance, key distribution may be accomplished by any public
          repository of keys. Any system in which the two endpoints have
          access to trust anchors and intermediate CA certificates that can be
          used to validate other endpoints&rsquo; certificates (including a
          system of self-signed certificates) can be used to support
          certificate validation in the below schemes.
</p>
<p>With real-time communications it is desirable to avoid fetching
          or validating certificates that delay call setup. Rather, it is
          preferable to fetch or validate certificates in such a way that call
          setup is not delayed. For example, a certificate can be validated
          while the phone is ringing or can be validated while ring-back tones
          are being played or even while the called party is answering the
          phone and saying "hello". Even better is to avoid fetching or
          validating persistent public keys at all.
</p>
<p>SRTP key exchange mechanisms that require
          a particular authentication infrastructure to operate (whether for
          distribution or validation) are gated on the deployment of a such an
          infrastructure available to both endpoints. This means that no media
          security is achievable until such an infrastructure exists. For SIP,
          something like <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sip-certs'>sip-certs<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jennings, C. and J. Fischl, &ldquo;Certificate Management Service for The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sip&#8209;certs]
          might be used to obtain the certificate of a peer.

Best Effort Encryption</h3>

<p>With best effort encryption, SRTP is used with endpoints that
          support SRTP, otherwise RTP is used.
</p>
<p>SIP needs a backwards-compatible best effort encryption in order
          for SRTP to work successfully with SIP retargeting and forking when
          there is a mix of forked or retargeted devices that support SRTP and
          don't support SRTP.
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Consider the case of Bob, with a phone that only does RTP and
              a voice mail system that supports SRTP and RTP. If Alice calls
              Bob with an SRTP offer, Bob's RTP-only phone will reject the
              media stream (with an empty "m=" line) because Bob's phone
              doesn't understand SRTP (RTP/SAVP). Alice's phone will see this
              rejected media stream and may terminate the entire call (BYE)
              and re-initiate the call as RTP-only, or Alice's phone may
              decide to continue with call setup with the SRTP-capable leg
              (the voice mail system). If Alice's phone decided to re-initiate
              the call as RTP-only, and Bob doesn't answer his phone, Alice
              will then leave voice mail using only RTP, rather than SRTP as
              expected.

              significant issues with this technique are (1) that multipart

              Session Border Controllers, and endpoints and (2) when forking,
              the <a class='info' href='#RFC3326'>Heterogeneous Error Response Forking

<dd>With
              this technique, the endpoints signal their desire to do SRTP by
              signaling RTP (RTP/AVP), and using an attribute ("a=") in the
              SDP. This technique is entirely backwards compatible with
              non-SRTP-aware endpoints, but doesn't use the RTP/SAVP protocol

<dt>Probing</dt>
<dd>With this

              technique. A disadvantage of probing is an active attacker can
              interfere with probes, and until probing completes (and SRTP is
              established) the media is in the clear.

          What remains unique is ZRTP, which can also accomplish its best
          effort encryption by probing (sending ZRTP messages over the media

Upgrading Algorithms</h3>

<p>It is necessary to allow upgrading SRTP encryption and hash
          algorithms, as well as upgrading the cryptographic functions used
          for the key exchange mechanism. With SIP's offer/answer model, this
          can be computionally expensive because the offer needs to contain
          all combinations of the key exchange mechanisms (all MIKEY modes,
          Security Descriptions) and all SRTP cryptographic suites (AES-128,
          AES-256) and all SRTP cryptographic hash functions (SHA-1, SHA-256)
          that the offerer supports. In order to do this, the offerer has to
          expend CPU resources to build an offer containing all of this
          information which becomes computationally prohibitive.
</p>
<p>Thus, it is important to keep the offerer's CPU impact fixed so
          that offering multiple new SRTP encryption and hash functions incurs
          no additional expense.

Shared Key Conferencing</h3>

<p>The consensus on the RTPSEC mailing list was to concentrate on
        unicast, point-to-point sessions. Thus, there are no requirements
        related to shared key conferencing. This section is retained for
        informational purposes.
</p>
<p>For efficient scaling, large audio and video conference bridges
        operate most efficiently by encrypting the current speaker once and
        distributing that stream to the conference attendees. Typically,
        inactive participants receive the same streams -- they hear (or see)
        the active speaker(s), and the active speakers receive distinct
        streams that don't include themselves. In order to maintain
        confidentiality of such conferences where listeners share a common
        key, all listeners must rekeyed when a listener joins or leaves a
        conference.
</p>
<p>An important use case for mixers/translators is a conference
        bridge:

<p>In the figure above, 1, 3, and 5 are RTP media contributions from
        Alice, Bob, and Carol, and 2, 4, and 6 are the RTP flows to those
        devices carrying the 'mixed' media.
</p>
<p>Several scenarios are possible:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>Multiple inbound sessions: 1, 3, and 5 are distinct RTP
            sessions,

<dd>Multiple outbound sessions: 2, 4, and 6 are distinct RTP

<dd>Single outbound session: 2, 4, and 6 are different flows of the
            same (multi-unicast) RTP session
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>If there are multiple inbound sessions and multiple outbound
        sessions (scenarios a and b), then every keying mechanism behaves as
        if the mixer were an end point and can set up a point-to-point secure
        session between the participant and the mixer. This is the simplest
        situation, but is computationally wasteful, since SRTP processing has
        to be done independently for each participant. The use of multiple
        inbound sessions (scenario a) doesn't waste computational resources,
        though it does consume additional cryptographic context on the mixer
        for each participant and has the advantage of data origin
        authentication.
</p>
<p>To support a single outbound session (scenario d), the mixer has to
        dictate its encryption key to the participants. Some keying mechanisms
        allow the transmitter to determine its own key, and others allow the
        offerer to determine the key for the offerer and answerer. Depending
        on how the call is established, the offerer might be a participant
        (such as a participant dialing into a conference bridge) or the
        offerer might be the mixer (such as a conference bridge calling a
        participant). The use of offerless INVITEs may help some keying
        mechanisms reverse the role of offerer/answerer. A difficulty,
        however, is knowing a priori if the role should be reversed for a
        particular call. The significant advantage of a single outbound
        session is the number of SRTP encryption operations remains constant
        even as the number of participants increases. However, a disadvantage
        is that data origin authentication is lost, allowing any participant
        to spoof the sender (because all participants know the sender's SRTP
        key).
