Abstract

   This document specifies a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   (DHCPv4) option for nodes that implement the Intra-Site Automatic
   Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP).

1. Introduction

   This document specifies a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   [DHCPv4] option for the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing
   Protocol [ISATAP]. The option encodes configuration information used
   by clients to initialize the Potential Router List (PRL) as specified
   in [ISATAP], section 6. The option format is similar to [RFC3361] and
   supports publishing one or more domain names or IPv4 addresses.

2. Requirements

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].

3. ISATAP DHCPv4 Option

   The ISATAP DHCPv4 option encodes a list of one or more 32-bit IPv4
   addresses or DNS [RFC1035] fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs). The
   elements in the list MUST NOT include a mix of IPv4 addresses and
   FQDNs; instead, the data type is identified by an encoding byte in
   the DHCPv4 option. The ISATAP DHCPv4 option encodes a sequence of
   octets using the following format:

    Code   Len   enc      Potential Router List
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
   | TBD |  n  | 0/1 |  p1 |  p2 |  p3 |  p4 | p5  | ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--

   In this format, the DHCPv4 option code is followed immediately by a
   'Len' octet that indicates the total number of octets that follow,
   including the 'enc' octet.

   When 'enc' = 0, the list contains a sequence of labels comprising one
   or more FQDN encoded exactly as specified in [RFC1035], section 3.1.
   (Note: this is the same format specified by [RFC3361], section 3.1).
   For example, if the server wants to advertise the FQDNs "isatap.com",
   "isatap.org" and "isatap.net", the DHCPv4 option would be encoded as
   follows:

   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   |TBD| 36| 0 | 6 |'i'|'s'|'a'|'t'|'a'|'p'| 3 |'c'|'o'|'m'| 0 |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   | 6 |'i'|'s'|'a'|'t'|'a'|'p'| 3 |'o'|'r'|'g'| 6 |'i'|'s'|'a'|
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   |'t'|'a'|'p'| 3 |'n'|'e'|'t'| 0 |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   When 'enc' = 1, the list contains one or more IPv4 addresses. In this
   case, 'Len' MUST be a minimum of 5 and a multiple of 4 plus one.
   (Note: this is the same format specified by [RFC3361], section 3.2).
   The DHCPv4 option for this encoding has the following format:

    Code   Len   enc   Address 1               Address 2
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
   | TBD |  n  |  1  | a1  | a2  | a3  | a4  | a1  |  ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--

   Clients MAY use the elements encoded in the ISATAP DHCPv4 option to
   initialize the Potential Router List as specified in [ISATAP],
   section 6.

4. IANA considerations

   A new DHCPv4 option number for ISATAP is requested.

5. Security considerations

   The security considerations in [DHCPv4] apply.
