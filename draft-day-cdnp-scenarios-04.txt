Internet-Draft              CDI Scenarios              November, 2001


1. Introduction

   This document presents several logical scenarios that are intended
   to describe potential CONTENT INTERNETWORKING configurations. These
   logical scenarios describe how various entities may combine to
   provide a complete end-to-end solution. These scenarios answer two
   distinct needs:

   1.  To provide some concrete examples of what CONTENT
       INTERNETWORKING is, and

   2.  To provide a basis for evaluating CONTENT INTERNETWORKING
       proposals.

   Each of the logical internetworking scenarios describes the
   theoretical interaction among a set of CONTENT INTERNETWORKING
   interfaces. From [2], the interaction between these interfaces
   provides:

   1.  REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING

   2.  DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING

   3.  ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING

   Some specific types of CONTENT NETWORKS (CNs) are also described
   whose internetworking interfaces may include only a subset of the
   functionality of the three systems.

   For specific historical scenarios where CONTENT INTERNETWORKING has
   been implemented, refer to [5].

   Terms in ALL CAPS are defined in [1].

2. Content Network Refinement Cases

   A CN is defined in [2] as having REQUEST-ROUTING, DISTRIBUTION, and
   ACCOUNTING interfaces. However, some participating networks may
   gravitate toward particular subsets of the CONTENT INTERNETWORKING
   interfaces. Others may be seen differently in terms of how they
   relate to their CLIENT bases. This section describes these refined
   cases of the general CN case so they may be available for easier
   reference in the further development of CONTENT INTERNETWORKING
   scenarios.

2.1  Publishing Content Network

   A Publishing Content Network (PCN), maintained by a PUBLISHER,
   contains an ORIGIN and has a NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP with two or
   more CNs. A PCN may contain SURROGATES for the benefit of serving


Day et. al.              Expires May 6, 2002                 [Page 3]
Internet-Draft              CDI Scenarios              November, 2001

   some CONTENT REQUESTS locally, but does not intend to allow its
   SURROGATES to serve CONTENT on behalf of other PUBLISHERS.

   This set of assumptions implies multiple things about the PCN's
   CONTENT INTERNETWORKING relationships. First, it is implied that the
   PCN contains the AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM for the
   PUBLISHER's CONTENT. This would allow the PUBLISHER to determine the
   distribution of CONTENT REQUESTS among enlisted CNs. Second, it
   implies that the PCN would only need to participate in a subset of
   CONTENT INTERNETWORKING. For example, a PCN's DISTRIBUTION
   INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM would only need to be able to receive
   DISTRIBUTION ADVERTISEMENTS, it would not need to be able to send
   them. Similarly, a PCN's REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM
   would not need to send AREA ADVERTISEMENTS. Finally, a PCN's
   ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM would only need to receive
   ACCOUNTING data, it would not need to send it.

2.2  Brokering Content Network

   A Brokering Content Network (BCN) is a network that does not operate
   its own SURROGATES. Instead, a BCN operates only CIGs as a service
   on behalf other CNs. A BCN may therefore be regarded as a
   "clearinghouse" for CONTENT INTERNETWORKING information.

   For example, a BCN may choose to participate in DISTRIBUTION
   INTERNETWORKING and/or REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING in order to
   aggregate ADVERTISEMENTS from one set of CNs into a single update
   stream for the benefit of other CNs. To name a single specific
   example, a BCN could aggregate CONTENT SIGNALS from CNs that
   represent PUBLISHERS into a single update stream for the benefit of
   CNs that contain SURROGATES. A BCN may also choose to participate in
   ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING in order to aggregate utilization data
   from several CNs into combined reports for CNs that represent
   PUBLISHERS

2.3  Local Request-Routing Content Network

   Another type of CN is the Local Request-Routing CONTENT NETWORK
   (LCN). An LCN is defined as a type of network where CLIENTS' CONTENT
   REQUESTS are always by some local SERVER (such as a caching proxy
   [1]). In this context, "local" is taken to mean that both the CLIENT
   and SERVER are within the same administrative domain, and there is
   an administrative motivation for forcing the local mapping. This
   type of arrangement is common in enterprises where all CONTENT
   REQUESTS must be directed through a local SERVER for access control
   purposes.

   As implied by the name, the LCN creates an exception to the rule
   that there is a single AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM for a
   particular item of CONTENT. By directing CONTENT REQUESTS through
   the local SERVER, CONTENT RESPONSES may be given to CLIENTS without
   first referring to the AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM. Knowing

Internet-Draft              CDI Scenarios              November, 2001

   this to be true, other CNs may seek a NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP with
   an LCN in order to perform DISTRIBUTION into the LCN and receive
   ACCOUNTING data from it. Note that once it's participating in
   DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING and ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING, the
   SERVERS within the LCN effectively take on the role of SURROGATES.
   However, an LCN would not intend to allow its SURROGATES to be
   accessed by non-local CLIENTS.

   This set of assumptions implies multiple things about the LCN's
   CONTENT INTERNETWORKING relationships. First, it is implied that the
   LCN's DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM would only need to be able
   to send DISTRIBUTION ADVERTISEMENTS, it would not need to receive
   them. Second, it is implied that an LCN's ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING
   SYSTEM would only need to send ACCOUNTING data, it would not need to
   receive it. Finally, due to the locally defined REQUEST-ROUTING, the
   LCN would not participate in REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING.

2.4  Regional vs. Global CNs

   Among the more general CNs that contain SURROGATES and participate
   in all three types of internetworking, we can make some broad
   generalizations that make it easier to discuss scenarios.

   For example, a CN administrator may have significant detailed
   information about their CLIENT base. Such a CN could be referred to
   as a Regional CN. For example, a cable modem provider may choose to
   place a SURROGATE in every cable head end. This provider could
   easily describe its CLIENT base to other CNs in ADVERTISEMENTS, such
   as by static tables of CLIENT IP addresses that are assigned to each
   head end. Another type of Regional CN may have dense coverage in
   many networks within a single country, and may be able to derive
   CLIENT IP addresses through a regional address registry.

   By comparison, a Global CN is one in which the CN administrator has
   only a general knowledge of their CLIENT base. For example, a CN
   provider may place SURROGATES in data centers of many different
   backbone networks in major cities around the world. The CLIENT bases
   that are close to each SURROGATE can be loosely derived by examining
   BGP tables or attempting to map nearby networks (i.e.
   ping/traceroute), however REQUEST-ROUTING decisions are typically
   more dynamic in this scenario.

   Naturally there are no hard rules for whether a given CN could be
   pigeonholed as "Regional" or "Global". Rather, we can imagine a
   continuum on which these are endpoints. In general, due to the
   global nature of the Internet, we can imagine Regional CNs seeking
   to establish relationships with Global CNs in order to increase
   their "scale" and "reach" [1]. In essence, a Global CN may seek to
   establish itself as a type of "tier 1" CN that smaller CNs will
   inevitably use to handle at least some CONTENT REQUESTS.

3. Logical Internetworking Scenarios

   This section provides several logical scenarios that may arise in
   CONTENT INTERNETWORKING implementations.

   Note that we obviously cannot examine every single permutation.
   Specifically, it should be noted that:

   o  Any one of the interconnected CNs may have other CONTENT
      INTERNETWORKING arrangements that may or may not be transitive to
      the relationships being described in the diagram.

   o  The graphical figures do not illustrate the CLIENT REQUEST paths.
      It is assumed that the direction of CLIENT REQUESTS follow the
      methodology given in [2] and that the end result is that a
      REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM eventually returns to the CLIENT the IP
      address of the SURROGATE deemed appropriate to honor the CLIENT's
      CONTENT REQUEST.

   o  To easily reference the two parties in a CONTENT INTERNETWORKING
      relationship, the CN performing a DISTRIBUTION task for another
      CN shall be referred to as the "enlisted CN". The CN providing
      the CONTENT to be DISTRIBUTED shall be referred to as the
      "originating CN".

3.1 General Content Internetworking

   This scenario considers the general case where two or more existing
   CNs wish to establish a CONTENT INTERNETWORKING relationship in
   order to provide an increased scale and reach for their existing
   customers. It assumes that all of these CNs already provide REQUEST-
   ROUTING, DISTRIBUTION, and ACCOUNTING services and that they will
   continue to provide these services to existing customers as well as
   offering them to other CNs.

   In this scenario, these CIs would be interconnect with others via a
   CIG which provides a REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM, a
   DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM, and an ACCOUNTING
   INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM. The net result of this interconnection would
   be that a larger set of SURROGATES will now be available to the
   CLIENTS.

   FIGURE 1 shows three CNs which have interconnected to provide
   greater scale and reach to their existing customers. They are all
   participating in DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING, REQUEST-ROUTING
   INTERNETWORKING, and ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING.

   As a result of the NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIPS it is assumed that:

   1.  CONTENT that has been INJECTED into any one of these originating
       CNs MAY be distributed into any other enlisted CN.


Day et. al.              Expires May 6, 2002                 [Page 6]
Internet-Draft              CDI Scenarios              November, 2001

   2.  Commands affecting the DISTRIBUTION of CONTENT MAY be issued
       within the originating CN, or MAY also be issued within the
       enlisted CN.

   3.  ACCOUNTING information regarding CLIENT access and/or
       DISTRIBUTION actions will be made available to the originating
       CN by the enlisted CN.

   4.  The originating CN would provide this accounting information to
       the PUBLISHER based on existing Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

   5.  CONTENT REQUESTS by CLIENTS MAY be directed to SURROGATES within
       any of the enlisted CNs.

   The decision of where to direct an individual CONTENT REQUEST MAY be
   dependent upon the DISTRIBUTION and REQUEST-ROUTING policies
   associated with the CONTENT being requested as well as the specific
   algorithms and methods used for directing these requests. For
   example, a REQUEST-ROUTING policy for a piece of CONTENT may
   indicate multiple versions exist based on the spoken language of a
   CLIENT. Therefore, the REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM of an enlisted CN
   would likely direct a CONTENT REQUEST to a SURROAGTE known to be
   holding a version of CONTENT of a language that matches that of a
   CLIENT.

3.2 BCN providing ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING and REQUEST-ROUTING
INTERNETWORKING

   This scenario describes the case where a single entity (BCN A)
   performs ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING and REQUEST-ROUTING
   INTERNETWORKING functions, but has no inherent DISTRIBUTION or
   DELIVERY capabilities. A potential configuration which illustrates
   this concept is given in FIGURE 2.

   In the scenario shown in FIGURE 2, BCN A is responsible for
   collecting ACCOUNTING information from multiple CONTENT NETWORKS (CN
   A and CN B) to provide a clearinghouse/settlement function, as well
   as providing a REQUEST-ROUTING service for CN A and CN B.

   In this scenario, CONTENT is injected into either CN A or CN B and
   its DISTRIBUTION between these CNs is controlled via the
   DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING SYSTEMS within the CIGs. The REQUEST-
   ROUTING SYSTEM provided by BCN A is informed of the ability to serve
   a piece of CONTENT from a particular CONTENT NETWORK by the REQUEST-
   ROUTING SYSTEMS within the interconnected CIGs.

   BCN A collects statistics and usage information via the ACCOUNTING
   INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM and disseminates that information to CN A and
   CN B as appropriate.

   As illustrated in FIGURE 2, are separate REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEMS
   employed within CN A and CN B. If the REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM
   provided by BCN A is the AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM for a
   given piece of CONTENT this is not a problem. However, each
   individual CNs may also provide the AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING
   SYSTEM for some portion of its PUBLISHER customers. In this case
   care must be taken to ensure that the there is one and only one
   AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM identified for each given
   CONTENT object.

3.3 BCN providing ACCOUNTING

   This scenario describes the case where a single entity (BCN A)
   performs ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING to provide a clearinghouse/
   settlement function only. In this scenario, BCN A would enter into
   NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIPS with multiple CNs that each perform their
   own DISTRIBUTION INTERNETOWRKING and REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING
   as shown in FIGURE 3.

3.4 PCN enlists multiple CNs

   In the previously enumerated scenarios, PUBLISHERS have not been
   discussed. Much of the time, it is assumed that the PUBLISHERS will
   allow CNs to act on their behalf. For example, a PUBLISHER may
   designate a particular CN to be the AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING
   SYSTEM for its CONTENT. Similarly, a PUBLISHER may rely on a
   particular CN to aggregate all its ACCOUNTING data, even though that
   data may originate at SURROGATES in multiple distant CNs. Finally, a
   PUBLISHER may INJECT content only into a single CN and rely on that
   CN to enlist other CNs to obtain scale and reach.

   However, a PUBLISHER may wish to maintain more control and take on
   the task of enlisting CNs itself, therefore acting as a PCN (Section
   2.1). This scenario, shown in FIGURE 4, describes the case where a
   PCN wishes to directly enter into NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIPS with
   multiple CNs. In this scenario, the PCN would operate its own CIG
   and enter into DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING, ACCOUNTING
   INTERNETWORKING, and REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING relationships
   with two or more CNs.

3.5 Multiple CNs enlist LCN

   A type of CN described in Section 3.2 is the LCN. In this scenario,
   we imagine a tightly administered CN (such as within an enterprise)
   has determined that all CONTENT REQUESTS from CLIENTS must be
   serviced locally. Likely due to a large CLIENT base in the LCN,
   multiple CNs determine they would like to engage in DISTRIBUTION
   INTERNETWORKING with the LCN in order to extend control over CONTENT
   objects held in the LCN's SURROGATES. Similarly, the CNs would like
   to engage in ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING with the LCN in order to
   receive ACCOUTING data regarding the usage of the content in the
   local SURROGATES. This scenario is shown in FIGURE 5.

4. Security Considerations

   Due to the likely reliance on ACCOUNTING data as the basis of
   payment for services, the likelihood of fraud may be a concern of
   parties that participate in CONTENT INTERNETWORKING. Indeed, it's
   easy to imagine fabricating log entries or increasing throughput
   numbers to increase revenue. While this is a difficult problem to
   solve, there are some approaches to be explored. A useful tool would
   be a "fraud detection" analysis tool that is capable of modeling
   human usage patterns and detecting anomalies. It may be logical for
   such a tool to be run by a BCN that is acting as an "impartial third
   party", enlisted only to ensure fairness among participants.
   Additionally, a BCN may be enlisted to perform random audits of
   ACCOUNTING data.

   This document assumes that any CONTENT INTERNETWORKING solutions
   which are derived within CDI will be compliant with the trust model
   given in [4].
