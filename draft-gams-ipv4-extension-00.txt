                    IPv4 Multi-Dimensional Extension
                      draft-gams-ipv4-extension-00

Abstract

   IPv4 addresses are running out.  I aim to create an extension to IPv4
   that will allow organizations to migrate to a larger address space
   without the need to replace all existing IPv4 devices and software.

Internet-Draft               IPv4 Extension               September 2010


1.  Introduction

   IPv4 addresses are running out and IPv6 does not provide complete
   compatibility with IPv4.  Providing prefixes to the 32-bit IPv4
   address space will provider larger amounts of addresses while making
   it easier to migrate from traditional IPv4 networks.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in


2.  Address Prefixes

   In order to provide larger address space, multi-homing capabilities,
   and similar properties of IPv6, including mobility addressing, I
   proposed the creation of a 96-bit locater ID that would prepend the
   32-bit IPv4 address.  In addition there would be a 64-bit multi-
   homing ID available for organizations that require multi-homing.

   The 96-bit locater ID will have the high order 64-bits assigned to
   ISPs and possibly large organizations by IANA.  This will leave 32-
   bits for subdivision by the ISPs, and for special addressing such as
   multicast, and mobility addressing unique to the provider level.
   Multicast and mobility addressing could also have a unique 64-bit ID
   assigned or possible use of the multi-homing ID as well.

   The 64-bit multi-homing ID would have the high order 48-bits assigned
   to organizations requiring multi-homing.  This would leave 16-bits
   for path determination under control of the organization assigned
   multi-homing ID.  Multi-homing IDs would then be registered with
   providers as needed.

   During transition and before 100% adoption, 32-bit IPv4 addresses
   would still need to be unique and NAT/PAT would be necessary.  After
   full adoption 32-bit IPv4 address suffixes could repeat within ISPs
   using the 96-bit locater ID to provide unique addressing.  Locating
   multi-homed addresses would require only the 64-bit multi-home ID and
   the 32-bit IPv4 compatible address as the Internet routers would have
   the mappings of multi-home ID to provider ID.

   Preferred multi-home pathing would use normal BGP path determination
   for any given 32-bit compatible IPv4 network if the lower 16-bit
   portion of the multi-home ID is all zeros.  However, the organization
   could advertise different 16-bit values to the various providers
   allowing a certain path to be preferred based on the value

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA would be required to maintain the 64-bit portion of the 96-bit
   locater ID, as well as, the 48-bit portion of the 64-bit multi-homing
   ID.


4.  Security Considerations

   Properly encrypted authentication between routing peers MUST be
   considered.  Not doing so could lead to Peer impersonation or denial
   of service attacks.
