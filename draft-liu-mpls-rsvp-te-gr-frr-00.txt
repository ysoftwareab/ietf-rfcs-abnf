 Abstract

    During RSVP-TE graceful restart (GR), the LSR communicates with
    its directly connected neighbors to synchronize LSP state to
    recover from control plane failure conditions. However, when the
    LSP has undergone a Fast Re-route (FRR), the directly connected
    neighbor of the Point of Local Repair (PLR) or Merge Point (MP)
    could be down. The FRR condition of the LSP could exist for a
    substantial period of time. During this period the network is
    vulnerable to traffic loss if control plane experiences a failure
    on the PLR or MP. This draft describes a mechanism to extend RSVP-
    TE GR to work under conditions where FRR has occurred.

 1. Introduction

    RSVP Graceful Restart ([RFC3473] and [RFC5063]) provides a
    mechanism to preserve the LSP during control plane failure so that
    traffic is not impacted. The mechanism uses the RSVP HELLO message
    defined in [RFC3209] to exchange graceful restart capability
    information and detect node failure. [RFC4558] introduces node-id
    based hello message.

 Internet-Draft      RSVP-TE Graceful Restart under         October 2009
                        Fast Re-route conditions



    RSVP fast reroute (FRR) is specified in [RFC4090] and provides a
    fast local repair mechanism when link or node failure occurs so
    that the traffic of protected LSP can be switched on PLR (Point of
    Local Repair) node to pre-established bypass or detour. The MP
    (merge point) node merges the traffic back to the protected LSP.
    When FRR is in effect, the traffic could stay in the bypass or
    detour for significant period of time. During this period of time,
    if PLR or MP's control plane restarts, there are certain scenarios
    where RSVP GR procedures cannot be applied. This document
    describes those scenarios and an extension to existing RSVP Hello
    mechanism to allow RSVP GR to operate between non directly
    connected neighbors. This enables RSVP GR to work when FRR is in
    effect.

 3.  Terminology

    The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology defined
    in [RFC3209], [RFC4090], [RFC3473] and [RFC5063].

 3. Problem Statement

    Per [RFC3209], RSVP Hello message is exchanged only between
    directly connected neighbors. [RFC3473] extends the RSVP hello
    mechanism to support RSVP Graceful Restart (GR) functionality. The
    hello message is used to carry graceful restart capability object
    and information used to preserve the LSP and recover the LSP state
    after control plane fails. If the hello session is not
    established, the graceful restart cannot be achieved.

    [RFC4090] specifies a fast local repair mechanism to re-route a
    protected LSP over a bypass tunnel. When the PLR detects a
    link/node failure, FRR is triggered and the PLR re-routes the
    protected LSP over a pre-established bypass tunnel. The protected
    LSP is merged back at the MP node. When the PLR and MP are not
    immediate neighbors there is no hello session between them. In
    such a situation if FRR is in effect and the control plane
    restarts on PLR or MP node, the protected LSP may be torn down
    thus leading to traffic loss.

                        Fast Re-route conditions



    Consider the example in Figure 1. A unidirectional protected LSP
    is setup as R1-R2-R3-R4-R5. The unidirectional bypass tunnel for
    node protection is established as R2-R6-R4. R2 is PLR node and R4
    is MP node. When link between R2-R3 fails or node R3 fails,
    traffic flows through the bypass R2-R6-R4. If R2 or R4 restarts,
    since hello is not running between R2 and R4, GR is not going to
    take effect and the protected LSP is not preserved. As a result,
    the traffic will get impacted.

 4. Extensions to RSVP Hello Message Handling

    A targeted hello session must be established through the exchange
    of hello messages between nodes that are not immediate neighbors
    but have a bypass tunnel between them. These Hellos may be sent
    via IP forwarding or via the bypass tunnel. If a bypass tunnel
    does not have an independent data plane failure detection
    mechanism (e.g. BFD) then a targeted Hello session sending Hellos
    via the bypass can act as one. If the bypass has independent
    failure detection mechanisms, the Hello should be sent via IP
    forwarding. For Hellos sent using IP forwarding an IP TTL value of
    255 is recommended whereas for Hellos sent via bypass tunnel the
    TTL of 1 should be used. The remote address must be the node id
    (IPv4 or IPv6) of the targeted neighbor and must also be used in
    the destination fields of the hello packet. The corresponding
    hello message handling procedures described in [RFC3209].
    [RFC3473] and [RFC4558] still apply. The RSVP graceful restart
    procedures described in [RFC3473] and [RFC5063] also applies to
    these non directly connected neighbors.

    At least one targeted hello session per pair of non directly
    connected PLR node and MP node must be established. If there are

 Internet-Draft      RSVP-TE Graceful Restart under         October 2009
                        Fast Re-route conditions



    multiple bypasses between the nodes, only one targeted hello
    session should be established, unless a targeted hello session is
    used to indicate data plane liveness. If there are multiple
    bypasses to a node, the selection of which one to use for sending
    the hello message is local policy. A hello session that uses IP
    forwarding should be used to avoid any forwarding problems
    specific to a LSP.

    A non directly connected neighbor may be configured to setup the
    targeted hello session. This configuration may be derived from the
    detour/bypass configuration.

    A targeted hello session may be automatically initiated by the
    node that is initiating the bypass. The peer node may create the
    hello session on receiving a hello. E.g. in Figure 1, R2 may
    create the Hello session to R4 when the bypass LSP R2-R6-R4 is
    initiated or a protected LSP R1-R2-R3-R4-R5 is associated with the
    bypass LSP. Also R4 may create a Hello session to R2 on seeing the
    Hello from R2.

    A targeted hello session may also be created automatically on
    receiving a PATH message from a neighbor that is not directly
    connected but has a LSP (bypass) to it. E.g. in Figure 1, if R2
    does not initiate Hello session creation, R4 may initiate creation
    of a Hello session with R2 on receiving a PATH message of the
    protected LSP from R2.

    If RSVP graceful restarted is enabled, the Restart_Cap Object
    should be included in the hello message following procedures
    described in the [RFC3473].

    Once the targeted hello session is established between the non-
    direct neighbors, the RSVP graceful restart procedures described
    in [RFC3473] and [RFC5063] should be followed if either node
    restarts.

    The support of the targeted hello can be enabled or disabled by
    configuration which is beyond the scope of this document.

    The hello session between direct neighbors should be able to co-
    exist with the targeted hello session.

 5. Security Considerations

    This document extends the RSVP hello message exchange to non-
    direct neighbors. The security considerations pertaining to the
    original [RFC3209] remain relevant. RSVP message security is
    described in [RFC2747] and provides integrity and authentication
    of the hello message.

 6. IANA Considerations

    This document makes no request of IANA.
