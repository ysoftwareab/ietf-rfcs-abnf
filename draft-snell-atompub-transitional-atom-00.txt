Internet-Draft              Transitional Atom              December 2005


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines a transitional form of Atom Entry Document
   [RFC4287] that may be used during the production lifecycle of an Atom
   Entry.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.

     "atom":  "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
     "t"   :  "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom-transitional"

   This specification uses terms from the XML Infoset [W3C.REC-xml-
   infoset-20040204].  However, this specification uses a shorthand; the
   phrase "Information Item" is omitted when naming Element Information
   Items.  Therefore, when this specification uses the term "element,"
   it is referring to an Element Information Item in Infoset terms.


3.  Transitional Atom Entry Documents

   The Transitional Atom Entry Document is a well-formed XML document
   derived from the Atom Entry Document defined by the Atom Syndication
   Format [RFC4287].  It's root is the t:entry element.

     namespace tatom = "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom-transitional"
     start = tatomEntry

   Transitional Atom allows the use of IRI's [RFC3987], xml:base and
   xml:lang in the same fashion described in Section 2 of the Atom
   Syndication Format specification.

   Transitional Atom is an extensible format adhering to the same
   mechanisms described in Section 6 of the Atom Syndication Format.


4.  The 't:entry' Element

   The "t:entry" element represents an individual Transitional Atom
   Entry.

     transitional-entry =
       element t:entry {
         atomCommonAttributes,
         (atomAuthor*
          & atomCategory*
          & atomContent?
          & atomContributor*
          & atomId?
          & atomLink*
          & atomPublished?
          & atomRights?
          & atomSummary?
          & atomTitle?
          & atomUpdated?
          & extensionElement*
         )
       }

   This specification assigns no significance to the order of the child
   elements of t:entry.

   The children of the 't:atom' element are defined by [RFC4287].

   o  t:entry elements MAY contain one or more atom:author elements.
   o  t:entry elements MAY contain any number of atom:category elements.
   o  t:entry elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:content
      element.
   o  t:entry elements MAY contain any number of atom:contributor
      elements.
   o  t:entry elements MAY contain exactly one atom:id element.
   o  t:entry elements that contain no child atom:content element SHOULD
      contain at least one atom:link element with a rel attribute value
      of "alternate".
   o  t:entry elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:link element
      with a rel attribute value of "alternate" that has the same
      combination of type and hreflang attribute values.
   o  t:entry elements MAY contain additional atom:link elements beyond
      those described above.
   o  t:entry elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:published
      element.
   o  t:entry elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:rights
      element.
   o  t:entry elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:source
      element.
   o  t:entry elements SHOULD contain an atom:summary element in either
      of the following cases:

      *  the t:entry contains an atom:content that has a "src" attribute
         (and is thus empty).
      *  the t:entry contains content that is encoded in Base64; i.e.
         the "type" attribute of atom:content is a MIME media type
         [RFC4288], but is not an XML media type [RFC3023], does not
         begin with "text/", and does not end with "/xml" or "+xml".
   o  t:entry elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:summary
      element.
   o  t:entry elements MAY contain exactly one atom:title element.
   o  t:entry elements MAY contain exactly one atom:updated element.


5.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations introduced by this
   specification.


6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations introduced by this specification.
