Abstract

   The current use of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
   Reconfigure extension is limited by a requirement that FORCERENEW
   message is authenticated.  This document defines a mechanism allowing
   the use of FORCERENEW without DHCP authentication.

Internet-Draft      DHCP Reconfigure Extension Option          June 2008


1.  Introduction

   The DHCP Reconfigure Extension defined in [RFC3203] is a useful
   mechanism allowing dynamic reconfiguration of a single host triggered
   by the DHCP server.  Its application is currently limited by a
   requirement that FORCERENEW message is always authenticated using
   procedures as described in [RFC3118].  The mandatory authentication
   was originally motivated by a legitimate security concern whereby in
   some network environments a FORCERENEW message can be spoofed.
   However, in some networks native security mechanisms already provide
   sufficient protection against spoofing of DHCP traffic.  An example
   of such network is a DSL Forum TR-101 [TR-101] compliant access
   network.

   In such environments the mandatory coupling between FORCERENEW and
   DHCP Authentication can be relaxed.  This document provides a
   mechanism allowing DHCP server and client to negotiate use of
   FORCERENEW without authentication.


2.  Proposal

   We suggest defining a new DHCP option TBD that, when inserted by DHCP
   Server in DHCPOFFER and DHCPACK messages, would instruct the client
   to enable processing of unauthenticated FORCERENEW messages.  The
   format of option TBD is as follows:

       Code   Len  Value
      +-----+-----+-----+
      | TBD |  1  | 0/1 |
      +-----+-----+-----+

   The client would indicate that it supports the functionality by
   inserting an Parameter Request List option (option 55, RFC 3203
   [RFC2131]) containing option TBD in DHCPDISCOVER and DHCPREQUEST
   messages.  In its response the server will only include the option
   TBD if it is specified in Parameter Request List received from the
   client.  The value of the option indicates whether unauthenticated
   FORCERENEW messages are permitted in the network (value = 1) or not
   (value = 0) thus giving the network administrator control over their
   usage.  A DHCP client receiving a DHCPOFFER or DHCPACK reply
   containing option TBD MUST accept unauthenticated FORCERENEW
   messages.


3.  IANA Considerations

   defined DHCP option as described in the text.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


4.  Security Considerations

   The potential security risks of using DHCP reconfigure extension with
   unauthenticated FORCERENEW message are outlined in [RFC3203], and led
   to the original authentication requirement.  Therefore, enabling this
   functionality should be done judiciously by network administrators.
