1.  Introduction

   The iCalendar [RFC5545] specification defines a standard way to
   describe calendar data.  The iTIP [RFC5546] specification defines a
   transport independent messaging protocol for scheduling messages
   based on iCalendar.  The iMIP [RFC6047] specification defines how the
   iTIP protocol can be used over an email [RFC5322] transport by
   "attaching" iCalendar parts to an email message.

   Whilst iMIP has been in use for quite some time, there continue to be
   problems with interoperability between different implementations.  In
   particular, many implementations are sensitive to the exact
   "structure" of the email message parts.  Some clients expect specific
   headers to be present, or to have specific values (e.g., a "Content-
   Disposition" header with a value "attachment").  What this means is
   that an iMIP message sent from one client to another often goes
   unrecognized as an iMIP message, and the calendar data is never
   processed as a scheduling message.  In some cases, clients generate
   multiple iCalendar attachments, with different "Content-Type" header
   values in order to have a greater chance of their message being
   processed correctly.

   This specification addresses these problems by introducing a new
   email message header that can be used by clients to clearly identify
   that an email message is in fact an iMIP message, as well as clearly
   identify which part within the email message corresponds to the
   iCalendar data to be processed as an iMIP message.

   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  iMIP-Content-ID Email Message Header

   When a client generates an iMIP email message it includes an "iMIP-
   Content-ID" header field in the MIME part corresponding to the
   iCalendar data used for scheduling.  There MUST be only one iCalendar
   part with that header present.  The client then includes an "iMIP-
   Content-ID" header in the top-level email message headers, setting
   the value of that header to the value used for the "iMIP-Content-ID"
   header associated with the iCalendar data part.

   A mail user agent that is capable of processing iMIP messages can do
   the following:

   1.  If a top-level "iMIP-Content-ID" message header is present, the
       mail user agent can parse the message body and extract the
       iCalendar data in the message sub-part with the matching "iMIP-
       Content-ID" header value.  This can then be handed off to the
       appropriate calendar user agent for processing as an iTIP
       message.  If an "iMIP-Content-ID" header is present at the top-
       level of the message, but no matching iCalendar data is found,
       then the email message MUST be processed as if the "iMIP-Content-
       ID" header were not present.

   2.  If an "iMIP-Content-ID" header is not present at the top-level of
       the message, then the client SHOULD look for the presence of that
       header in a message sub-part and apply the following rules:

       A.  If a single "iMIP-Content-ID" is present in a sub-part of the
           message and the associated part is a valid iCalendar iMIP
           message, then the iCalendar data can be handed off to the
           appropriate calendar user agent for processing as an iTIP
           message.

       B.  In all other cases (including multiple "iMIP-Content-ID"
           headers present in different sub-parts), the email message
           MUST be processed as if the "iMIP-Content-ID" header were not
           present.

   The key benefit of this approach is that it allows mail user agents
   (and automated email processing/filtering systems like SIEVE
   [RFC5228]) to quickly and clearly identify incoming iMIP messages,
   without the need to do an in-depth examination of the MIME structure
   of the message to look for suitable iCalendar attachments.  In
   addition, the presence of this header will not impact current

   processing of iMIP messages and thus provides a backwards compatible,
   incremental upgrade to a more reliable mechanism.

3.1.  Formal Definition

   The "iMIP-Content-ID" header field is specified as follows using
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form [RFC5234], with additional terms from
   [RFC5322]:

   imip-content-id = "iMIP-Content-ID:" msg-id

4.  Security Considerations

   Email message security typically does not cover top-level message
   headers in signed or encrypted email data.  It is therefore possible
   for an attacker to add, modify or remove an "iMIP-Content-ID" header
   in the top-level message headers.  Such an attack can be mitigated by
   using a technology such as DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)
   [RFC6376], and it is RECOMMENDED that the "iMIP-Content-ID" header be
   included as one of the signed header fields.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is asked to register the new header field, using the
   template as follows, in accordance with [RFC3864].

   Header field name:  iMIP-Content-ID

   Applicable protocol:  mail

   Status:  standard

   Author/Change controller:  IETF

   Specification document(s):  This document

   Related information:  iMIP [RFC6047]
