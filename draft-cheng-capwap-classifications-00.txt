1. Introduction 
    
   Wireless local area networks (WLANs) have generated tremendous 
   interests among both consumers and the industry. Consequently, 
   developments in this field are fast-paced and are taken up by a 
   number of participants. As with any process that involves diversified 
   participation, developments in WLAN technologies have led to the 
   introduction of different types of devices, architectures and 
   strategies. Although these advancements are based on the standardized 
   IEEE 802.11 specifications, they nonetheless present a host of 
   incompatibility issues that ultimately affect the end market.  
    
   A particular example of such incompatibility is related to WLAN 
   architectures that incorporate centralized controller entities or 
   Access Controllers (ACs). ACs were introduced to simplify the 
   deployment and management of large-scale WLANs by aggregating control 
   of a number of Access Points (APs) at a single controller entity. 
   Additionally, designs for these entities include consolidating some 
   WLAN functionality at the ACs and leaving the remaining to the APs.   
    
   While such division of functionality among APs and ACs is widely 
   endorsed, the specifics in which they are accomplished vary among 
   manufacturers and their implementations. These differences introduce 
   complications for consumers and enterprises, which in turn adversely 
   affects WLAN adoption.  
    
   This document presents a means for classifying WLAN functions based 
   on operational similarities. The functionality may then be divided 
   between ACs and APs on the basis of the classifications.

   The functionality types are classified based on their relations to 
   the ISO-OSI protocol layers. Functionality type 1, Radio Frequency 
   (RF), relates to those functional aspects that are common to the RF 
   interface between an AP and a mobile client. This is the physical 
   layer. Next, L2 processing relates to the subsequent MAC layer while 
   type 3 L3 processing deals with the network layer. Finally, type 4 
   functionality combines control aspects that are common to all APs.     
    
   The advantage of such classifications is that it is based on well 
   established concepts of protocol layering. This ensures that the 
   execution of different types of functionality may be optimized in 
   independent and efficient ways. And with the expected growth in WLAN 
   load levels, optimal performance of network entities becomes a 
   significant priority. 
    
   It is quite obvious from the table that the Type 2 functions 
   corresponds to the MAC layer functions defined by the IEEE802.11. 
   Therefore, it would be possible that the functions to be split in 
   further detail. For example, the security part, e.g. 802.11i, and the 
   QoS control part, e.g. 802.11e, could be separate as Type 2A, Type 2B 
   etc. But this kind of split of the IEEE802.11 MAC function needs to 
   be rectified by the IEEE. The general principle is that the split 
   functions could operate separately.  
    
    
3. Need for Classifications 
    
   The classifications of WLAN functionality represent the integral 
   units that may be implemented in ACs and APs as parts of their WLAN 
   service capabilities. As such, enterprises may choose for example, 
   APs comprising types 1, 2 and 4 functionalities and a corresponding 
   controller capable of type 3 IP processing. Alternatively, APs may be 
   simplified to realize only type 1 RF functionality while a 
   sophisticated AC realizes the other remaining types of 
   functionalities. This follows from the prevailing trend where ACs 
   aggregate some WLAN functionality leaving only the remaining for the 
   APs, albeit in a structured manner.  
    
   As such, standardized means of classifications allow for consistency 
   in addressing various types of WLAN devices and divisions. This leads 
   to increased flexibility in designs for ACs and APs. Such flexibility 
   in turn ensures that different market requirements are addressed in 
   efficient and focused ways. So in addition to providing various 
   options for dividing functionality, the classifications also promote 
   interoperability between different types of devices.  
    
   The classifications also form a based for identifying different types 
   of APs, ACs and their compatibilities. For example, APs incorporating

Internet-Draft      Functionality Classifications       February 2004 
 
 
   functionality types 1 and 2 would require support from a 
   corresponding types 3 and 4 AC or from a set of ACs of types 3 and 4. 
   In essence, the classifications present opportunities for 
   certification processes between APs and ACs.     
    
4. Conclusion 
    
   The classifications for WLAN functionalities presented so far need to 
   be realized as part of the CAPWAP effort. Doing so would allow for 
   ease and flexibility in WLAN deployments. Also, establishing a 
   consistent means of classifications would ensure interoperability 
   between different types of APs and ACs from different manufacturers. 
   Additionally, it presents opportunities to optimize network entities 
   so as to deliver performance commensurate with WLAN needs and 
   expectations. There is also a need for devising appropriate policies 
   for dividing functionality among ACs and APs which would further 
   simplify the deployment of WLANs comprising different types of 
   devices with varying types of functionality.   
    
   These aspects would give manufacturers greater flexibility in 
   designing their products knowing that they would be compatible with 
   devices from other manufacturers. Similarly, consumers gain with the 
   flexibility in choosing and deploying equipment suited to their 
   particular needs.

Security Considerations 
 
   Security is an integral issue to CAPWAP. As such, the aspects put 
   forth in this document will base their security requirements on that 
   of the broader CAPWAP goals.
