   Abstract 

   This draft describes a generic associated channel header (GE-ACH) 
   that provides a control channel associated with an MPLS LSP, 
   pseudowire or MPLS section. The VCCV ACH defined for PWs in RFC 5085 
   is generalized to allow a larger set of control channel and OAM 
   functions to be used to meet the requirements of packet transport and 
   other applications of MPLS.

Internet-Draft    Generic Associated Channel Header          June 2008 
    

1. Introduction 

   There is a need for Operations and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms that   
   can be used for edge-to-edge (i.e. between originating and 
   terminating LSRs or T-PEs) and segment fault detection (e.g. between 
   any two LSRs or S-PEs along the path of an LSP or PW), diagnostics, 
   maintenance and other functions for a Pseudowire and an LSP. Some of 
   these functions can be supported using tools such as VCCV [3] or LSP-
   Ping [7]. However, a requirement has been indicated to extend these 
   toolsets, in particular where MPLS networks are used for packet 
   transport services and network operations [6]. These include 
   performance monitoring, automatic protection switching, and support 
   for management and signaling communication channels. These tools must 
   be applicable to, and function in essentially the same manner (from 
   an operational point of view) on both MPLS PWs and MPLS LSPs. They 
   must also operate in-band on the PW or LSP such that they do not 
   depend on PSN routing, user data traffic or ultimately on control 
   plane functions. 

   Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) can use an 
   associated channel to provide a control channel between a PW's 
   ingress and egress points over which OAM and other control messages 
   can be exchanged. In this draft, we propose a generic associated 
   channel header (GE-ACH) to enable the same control channel mechanism 
   be used for MPLS Sections, LSPs and PWs. The associated channel 
   header (ACH) specified in RFC 4385 [2] is used with additional code 
   points to support additional MPLS OAM functions.  

1.1. Objectives 

   This draft proposes a mechanism to provide for the OAM needs of 
   transport applications. It creates a generic OAM identification 
   mechanism that may be applied to all MPLS LSPs, while maintaining 
   compatibility with the PW associated channel header (ACH) [2].  It 
   also normalizes the use of the ACH for PWs in a transport context. 

    

1.2. Scope 

   This draft defines the encapsulation header for LSP, MPLS Section and 
   PW associated channel messages.  

   It does not define how associated channel capabilities are signaled 
   or negotiated between LSRs or PEs, the operation of various OAM 
   functions, or the messages transmitted on the associated channel.

   This draft does not deprecate existing MPLS and PW OAM mechanisms. 

1.3. Terminology 

   ACH: Associated Channel Header 

   MPLS Section:  A Section is a network segment between two LSRs that 
   are immediately adjacent  

2. Generic Associated Channel  

   VCCV [3] defines three control channel types that may be used to 
   multiplex OAM messages onto a PW. CC type 1, uses an associated 
   channel header and is referred to as "In-band VCCV", CC type 2 which 
   uses the router alert label to indicate VCCV packets and is referred 
   to as "Out of Band VCCV", and CC type 3 that uses the TTL to force 
   the packet to be processed by the destination routers control plane 
   (known as "MPLS PW Label with TTL == 1").  

   This draft proposes that in transport applications only the type 1 
   (associated channel header) mechanism is used for LSP OAM and for PW 
   OAM. In transport applications a static or traffic engineered LSP is 
   normally used, thus the data and the OAM will follow the same path. 
   This does not preclude the use of the GE-ACH mechanism described in 
   this draft for other applications of MPLS. 

   Note that VCCV also includes mechanisms for negotiating the control 
   channel and connectivity verification (i.e. OAM tool) types between 
   PEs.  

   This section defines a generic associated channel header (GE-ACH) 
   that identifies packets on the associated channel. 

2.1. Generic Associated Channel Header 

   The format of the GE-ACH for LSP, Section and PW associated channel 
   traffic is shown in Figure 1: 

    
       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   The first nibble is set to 0001b to indicate a channel associated 
   with a PW or LSP. The Version and Reserved fields are set to 0, as 
   specified in RFC 4385 [2]. 

   Values for the channel type used for VCCV are specified in RFC 4446 
   [4]. 

   This draft specifies the following additional channel types: 

   0xXX - for OAM functions  

   0xYY - for APS functions  

   0xKK - for Management Communications Channel (MCC) functions  

   0xZZ - for Signaling Communications Channel (SCC) functions  

   The functionality of these channel types will be defined elsewhere. 

    

3. Congestion Considerations 

   The congestion considerations detailed in RFC 5085 [1] apply. Further 
   generic associated channel-specific congestion considerations will be 
   detailed in a future revision of this draft. 

4. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations detailed in RFC 5085 [1] apply. Further 
   generic associated channel-specific congestion considerations will be 
   detailed in a future revision of this draft. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   This draft requests that code points for the following GE-ACH channel 
   types be allocated from the IANA PW Associated Channel Type registry 
   [4]: 

   0xXX - for OAM functions  

   0xYY - for APS functions  

   0xKK - for Management Communications Channel (MCC) functions  

   0xZZ - for Signaling Communications Channel (SCC) functions

Internet-Draft    Generic Associated Channel Header          June 2008 
    

   The PW Associated Channel Type registry is currently allocated based 
   on the IETF consensus process, described in [5]. This allocation 
   process was chosen based on the consensus reached in the PWE3 working 
   group that pseudowire associated channel mechanisms should be 
   reviewed by the IETF and only those that are consistent with the PWE3 
   architecture and requirements should be allocated a code point. 

   However, a requirement has emerged to allow for vendor-specific 
   optimizations or extensions to OAM and other control protocols 
   running in an associated channel, by supporting vendor specific code 
   points [6]. This would prevent code points used for such functions 
   from being allocated through the IETF standards process in future. 
   Vendor specific code point space thus protects an installed base of 
   equipment from potential inadvertent overloading of code points. 

   Each draft specifying ACH protocols must provide a solution for 
   supporting vendor-specific types, in accordance with [6], in addition 
   to those allocated by IETF consensus. The details of these solutions 
   are outside the scope of this draft.
