1.  Introduction

   IEEE 802.16 group is working since its creation to provide solutions
   for broadband wireless access to fixed, mobile and portable users.
   IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] was released to standardize fixed broadband
   wireless access in point-to-multipoint environments, while IEEE
   802.16e [3], which has been recently completed, addresses mobile
   broadband wireless access.

   Recently, the first set of IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] equipments have
   already been certified by the WiMax Forum, while the IEEE 802.16e [3]
   will have its certification scheduled during the first quarter of
   2007.  While vendors try to certify their equipments, network
   operators and service providers are working on business models that
   will strongly benefit from the usage of these technologies.  Costs
   reduction for network operators combined with easier broadband access
   for users is attractive for the telecommunications industry.
   Additionally, the Always-Best-Connected (ABC) concept can be
   envisaged.

   One of the stronger business models for IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] is to
   build a network architecture able to support IPv6 real-time services
   using IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] as a backhaul for IEEE 802.11 [4]
   networks.  In this scenario, users must have the capability of moving
   between Access Points attached to different Subscriber Stations.
   This implies, supporting dynamic and fast service flow reservations.

   In the so-called "4G" network environments, the access to different
   services with different requirements needs to be accomplished, and
   therefore the user will have capabilities to differentiate its own
   traffic and assign higher priority to critical traffic.  Therefore,
   both IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] and IEEE 802.16e [3], as some of the most
   promising access technologies for next generation networks, also need
   to be able to differentiate among different services that are being
   used by the same terminal device.

2.  Terminology

   The terms defined below are from both, the IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] and
   the IEEE 802.16e [3] specifications.

      layer; responsible for providing the main functionalities of the
      MAC layer, such as addressing and encapsulation.

   o  PS (Privacy Sublayer): Sublayer in IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] MAC layer;
      responsible for providing subscribers with the privacy across the

3.  IEEE 802.16-2004/802.16e MAC Layer Short Overview

   As defined in the IEEE 802.16-2004/802.16e [3] [2], and illustrated
   in Figure 2, the MAC layer is composed of three sublayers: the CS
   (Service Specific Convergence Sublayer), the CPS (Common Part
   Sublayer) and the PS (Privacy Sublayer).  The CS is responsible for
   receiving packets from the upper layers, classifying them according
   to the CS type being used and then passing the classified packets to
   the Common Part Sublayer (CPS) - which is the sublayer below the CS.
   The CPS performs the main functionalities from the MAC layer, such as
   addressing and data encapsulation (among others).  The PS provides
   secure communication.  A set of CSs are defined in IEEE 802.16-2004/
   802.16e [2] [3].  The most important CS types are the IPv4 CS, IPv6
   CS, 802.1Q/VLAN CS and 802.3/Ethernet CS.  Using 802.3/Ethernet CS is
   more flexible since it allows us to support both IPv4 and IPv6 with a
   single CS.  Whether IPv4 or IPv6 is being used, the 802.3/Ethernet CS
   is global and abstract enough to support both protocols.

   When compared with other wireless technologies, IEEE 802.16-2004/
   802.16e [2] [3] has a different behaviour, as by default, it is a
   connection oriented technology.  As a consequence, no packets are
   allowed to traverse the IEEE 802.16-2004/802.16e [2] [3] wireless
   link if no service flow reservation has been previously established.

4.  Scenario Description

   With the accelerating trends of mobile access enabling internet
   access anytime and everywhere, ubiquitous networking is required.
   IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] used as a backhaul for IEEE 802.11 [4] networks
   (hotspots) is able to provide ubiquitous broadband access.  This type
   of scenario raises a set of important problems that must be solved
   for its successfull implementation of the later.  An example of this
   scenario is illustrated in Figure 1.

   Figure 1: Basic architecture scenario example

   As shown in Figure 1, we have a multi-hop network composed by IEEE
   802.16-2004 [2] and IEEE 802.11 [4].  Basically, IEEE 802.16-2004 [2]
   is used as backhaul for the IEEE 802.11 [4] network.  An AR connects
   the access network to the operator core network.  Although in the
   shown topology only one BS is connected to the AR, several Base
   Stations (BSs) can be attached to the AR.  Also, several Subscriber



Neves, et al.           Expires September 1, 2006               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   IPv6 RT usage of 802.16: Prob Statement   February 2006


   Stations (SSs) can be connected to the BS.  Finally, an AP is
   connected to each one of the SSs, allowing users to connect to the
   network through the IEEE 802.11 [4] network.  To simplify, in
   Figure 1 only one MN per AP is shown.

   As we can see in Figure 1, the Mobile Nodes (MNs) are connected to
   the Access Points (APs) through the IEEE 802.11 [4] protocol.  The
   IEEE 802.11 [4] network is connected to the SS from the IEEE 802.16-
   2004 [2] system.  Fast-handovers between the presented multi-hop
   network and other network scenarios, such as UMTS or single-hop IEEE
   802.11 [4] networks, must be supported in these environments.  And,
   as shown in Figure 1, fast-handovers between two IEEE 802.11 [4]
   multi-hop networks must be supported.

5.  Problem Statement

   For next generation networks to support real-time services, a set of
   features that are not taken into account currently must be supported.
   For instance, fast MN and totally dynamic network access, dynamic
   modification of previously established reservations without service
   interruption, Quality of Service (QoS) and fast-handover.  IEEE
   802.16-2004 [2], as a next generation metropolitan broadband wireless
   access technology, must be compliant with these features.

5.1.  MN Network Access in IEEE 802.16-2004

   In real-time environments, users must have fast access to the
   requested services without having to wait long periods for the
   services initialization.  As already mentioned, no packets are
   allowed to traverse the wireless link if no appropriate reservation
   has been established.  Since we are adopting 802.3/Ethernet CS, a
   reservation must be performed using the MN MAC address.  Besides, the
   network management entity that is responsible for performing the
   reservation in the IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] air link must be aware of the
   MN MAC address in order to perform the allocation.  For instance, as
   we can see in Figure 1, the network management entity has to know
   when a new MN connects to the AP and find the MN MAC address.  The MN
   MAC address can only be discovered as soon as the MN gets connected.
   This lack of information about the MN MAC address is time consuming
   and breaks the fast MN network entry.  Therefore, it is not a trivial
   process for the network management entity to provide a fast network
   entry for the MN.

5.2.  Dynamic SF Modification in IEEE 802.16-2004

   Dynamic service flow modifications are also a requirement.  Users
   must be able to dynamically modify the set of QoS parameters from a
   reservation.  However, this implies that the service being used is
   not interrupted.  The user should not notice that changes are being
   made.  Otherwise, no dynamic service modification is provided.

5.3.  Fast-Handover support in IEEE 802.16-2004

   As explained in Section 3, IEEE 802.16-2004/802.16e [2] [3] behaviour
   can compromise fast-handover support when IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] is
   used as a backhaul for IEEE 802.11 [4] networks (hotspots).  In the
   scenario shown in Figure 1, the MN performs a fast-handover between
   APs attached to different SSs.  In these cases, the service flow
   reservations that were being used in SS2 have to be teardown and
   allocated in SS3.

   Despite the shown scenario in Figure 1 illustrates a fast-handover



Neves, et al.           Expires September 1, 2006               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft   IPv6 RT usage of 802.16: Prob Statement   February 2006


   between two multi-hop access networks (IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] and IEEE
   802.11 [4]), the fast-handover process could occur between one multi-
   hop access network and other access networks, such as UMTS or single-
   hop IEEE 802.11 [4] networks.

   As shown in Figure 1, the MN is initially connected to AP2 which is
   attached to SS2.  A service flow is allocated in the IEEE 802.16-2004
   [2] wireless link from the BS to SS2 allowing the MN to send/receive
   data through/from the core network (accessed through the AR).  While
   the MN is physically moving away from AP2, the coverage will decrease
   and, as a consequence, AP2 will start the handover process of the MN
   to AP3.  All the entities involved in the handover are notified, and
   the handover is performed.  Immediately after the handover process,
   service flow reservations in SS2 are teardown and new service flows
   must be allocated in SS3.  Since the MN is moving, service flow
   establishment in SS3 must be fast enough to support fast-handover and
   thus, handover all services from the AP2 to the AP3 without traffic
   disruption.  If the service flow allocation in SS3 is slow, the
   handover latency will be high and thus, service(s) running in the MN
   will be degraded during this period of time.  Therefore, fast service
   flow reservation in SS3 is crucial.  Since service flow allocations
   in IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] systems are not fast enough to support fast-
   handover, how can this feature be fully supported in this scenario,
   without the MN noticing service interruption?  A solution for this
   issue must be found, allowing network operators, service providers
   and users to benefit from such scenario.

5.4.  Service differentiation in IEEE 802.16-2004/802.16e

   Another issue that must be solved is related with QoS, particularly,
   with the granularity of service differentiation achieved in the
   wireless link.  This is a common issue for both, IEEE 802.16-2004 [2]
   and IEEE 802.16e [2] to support real-time services.  As explained in
   Section 3 and illustrated in Figure 2, the MAC layer is composed of
   three sublayers: the CS (Service Specific Convergence Sublayer), the
   CPS (Common Part Sublayer) and the PS (Privacy Sublayer).  As
   depicted in Section 3, 802.3/Ethernet is used as the CS.  Using
   802.3/Ethernet as the CS, packet classification is done based on the
   MSS/MN MAC address.

   To allow packet forwarding through and from the MSS/MN, a reservation
   is established between the BS and the MSS/SS.  The new reserved
   service flow has a set of QoS parameters associated (provided during
   the flow establishment process).  Additionally, it uses the MSS/MN
   MAC address as the classification parameter.  Thus, all the packets
   that are sent/received to/from the MSS/MN are forward through the
   established service flow.  Therefore, the granularity of the QoS
   reservation is the MSS/MN.  Figure 2 illustrates this scenario, where

   the MSS/MN MAC address is xx:yy:zz:xx:yy:zz.

   Figure 2: Service differentiation example

   In this case, all packets for the MSS/MN, are classified by the
   802.16 system and sent in SF y.  In Figure 2 we depict this issue in
   both, IEEE 802.16e [3] and IEEE 802.16-2004 [2].  Since 802.3/
   Ethernet is being used as the CS, it is not possible to differentiate
   among different services for the same MSS/MN.  It makes no sense to
   define two service flows in the air link with the same classification
   parameters, for the same MSS/MN.  Even if the MSS/MN is running only
   one service, signaling packets and data packets may be sent in
   different service flows in order to achieve high performance.  Thus,
   a problem is identified on how to differentiate/distinguish different
   services in the 802.16 [3] [2] wireless link for the same MSS/MN,
   using 802.3/Ethernet CS.  For next generation network environments, a
   solution for this problem must be found providing per service QoS
   guarantees, where QoS differentiation should be done based on each
   service instead of each MSS/MN.
