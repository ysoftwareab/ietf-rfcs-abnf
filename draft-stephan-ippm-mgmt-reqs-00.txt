Abstract 
    
   The IPPM Working group has specified metrics for measuring the 
   performance of an IP network. They are implemented in measurement 
   platform. Processing widespread end to end measurement requires a 
   common interface for the management of the measurement of the IPPM 
   metrics. This memo specifies a set of requirements of a management 
   service for the IPPM measurements.

1. Motivations and goals 
    
      Although the IPPM WG has specified more than 20 metrics and that 
   they are now implemented, there is not currently a standard for 
   managing them.  
 
   This memo lists a collection of requirements for managing widespread 
   end to end measures using the IP performance metrics specified by the 
   IPPM Working Group. It refers to notions introduced and discussed in 
   the IPPM Framework document, RFC 2330 [1]. This memo is intended to 
   be parallel in structure to the memo draft-ietf-ippm-owdp-reqs-00.txt 
   [2]. The reader is assumed to be familiar with these documents. 
 
   Sharing points of measure across administrative areas increases both 
   the number of points of measures and the value-add of the results. 
   It increases dramatically the number of feasible end to end measures 
   while providing reliable pieces of information for management of  
   SLA, provisioning, troubleshooting, bandwidth managementà 
 
   The difficulties in managing a system of end to end points of 
   measures are more administrative than technical. The main issues to 
   address are (1) to provide an efficient management of the different 
   steps of the measure, (2) to guaranty the unambiguousness of the 
   measure, (3) to guaranty the trustworthiness of results,(4) to permit 
   efficient troubleshooting and (5) to be flexible enough to accept new 
   measure definitions. 
   Managing distributed measures requires 3 levels of functionality: 
    
  +   The test plane timestamps the event, sends and receives the 
       packets. 
   
  +   The control plane manages the network measures. It controls the 
       activation, the deletion and the retrieval of the result of the 
       measure.

Internet Draft        IPPM Management Requirements             Sept 2001   
                                     
                                     
   
  +   The management plane is in charge of the administrative aspects 
       and of all the issues which are not covered by the 2 previous 
       planes. 
    
2. Convention 
    
   A peer is an identified NMS entity from a trusted administrative 
   area.  
    
   The control plane uses a protocol to exchange information. The draft-
   ietf-ippm-owdp-reqs-00.txt [2] introduces the requirement for such a 
   protocol, and defines a generic name, OWDP-Control. 
    
   The test plane uses a protocol to perform the measures. The draft-
   ietf-ippm-owdp-reqs-00.txt [2] introduces the requirement for such a 
   protocol, and defines a generic name, OWDP-Test. 
    
   A consolidation measure is a aggregated measure or a statistical 
   measure performed on the result of a network measure or on another 
   consolidation measure. 
    
3. Architecture 
    
   One of the conclusion of the draft-ietf-ippm-owdp-reqs-00.txt [2] is 
   that the control plane may be implemented using different protocols 
   and that the test plane has to be lightweight and easy to implement.  
    
   The management plane provides a common interface for a system of 
   points of measures using heterogeneous control protocols while 
   preserving the complexity of the points of measures. 
    
   The control plane manages the network measures, and the test plane 
   produces singleton results. The control plane provides the management 
   plane with the primitives to control the network measures.  
    
   The management plane directly controls the measure of aggregated and 
   statistical metrics. 
    
4. Functional Requirements 
   
  (1) The whole service should provide ability to control, measure, 
       record, and distribute the results of measurements of the 
       metrics defined in the IPPM Working Group. End to end 
       measurements are widespread, involve different administrative 
       areas and third parties. In a way to achieve end to end 
       measures, the control plane should be accessed by peers under 
       the control of the management plan. It controls both the access 
       to the OWDP-Control and to the OWDP-Test. The granularity of the 
       management distinguishes the control of a measurement instance 
       from the access to the produced results. It provide the peer

Internet Draft        IPPM Management Requirements             Sept 2001   
                                     
                                     
       with a hierarchical grant mechanism to allow the share of the 
       result. 
   
  (2) The specification should focus on the design of a high level of 
       interoperability and evolubility. It should comport sections 
       that develop these aspects while detailing case studies. 
   
   
  (3)  The specification of the management of the IPPM metrics should 
       be respectful of the RFC2330 framework to provide trusted 
       results. 
   
  (4)  The management information exchange should be efficient enough 
       and permit end to end troubleshooting. 
   
  (5)  The design should guaranty the integration of future IPPM 
       metrics definitions. 
 
 
4.1. Management of the access to the points of measures 
    
   Internet flows are widespread. The management plane must permit end 
   to end measures across administrative areas: peering management. 
    
4.1.1. Control of the access  
    
   Sharing points of measures across administrative areas squares the 
   number of feasible measures while providing value-added information 
   to the management of high level services.  
    
   The management plane must provide a hierarchical grant mechanism to 
   control the access to the points of measures by peers: 
    
  +   An administrator of an area allows peers to manage a set of 
       network or consolidation measures on a point of measure.  
   
  +   A peer allows other peers to perform consolidation measures on 
       the results produced by its measures. 
   
  +   A peer may be only granted to consult fully identified results. 
    
   { Comment: Sharing network measures inside a point of measure reduces 
   the test plane bandwidth consuming while providing intrinsically 
   consistent results.} 
    
4.1.2. naming of the measure 
    
   In a point of measure, a measure instance belongs to a peer. On the 
   network a measure involved several points of measures. The naming of 
   the measure instances must be designed to permit an efficient 
   management.

Internet Draft        IPPM Management Requirements             Sept 2001   
                                     
                                     
    
   Currently each point of measure is in charge of the naming of the 
   instance. It results in having different names for one measure 
   instance: 
    
   +   It is not acceptable, especially for interoperability purpose, 
       because it introduces ambiguity at the beginning of the measure 
       process.  
    
   +   It does not provide the managers of each point with a 
       unambiguous identifier of a measure instance. Such kind of 
       confusion increase dramatically the risk of misunderstanding 
       during troubleshooting. 
    
   +   It is not efficient for troubleshooting because the whole 
       measure setup duration may increase due to longer negotiation 
       duration exchange with one point of measure while getting an 
       instance name. 
    
 
   The management framework must provide a peer with a naming space 
   where is identified its measure instances: 
    
  +   It permits the peer to use the same identifier in all the points 
       of measures involved by a measure.  
   
  +   The results of a measure are numbered in this naming space. 
   
  +   It provides an efficient share framework to the grant mechanism.  
 
    
4.2. Interoperability issues 
    
   Peering management permits interoperable access to points of 
   measures. Measure must interoperate too. 
    
   The configuration of the measure must be unambiguous to permit a high 
   level of interoperability.  
    
4.2.1. time zone 
    
   The time zone parameter may be different at each point of the 
   measure. The timestamp representation should be unique to avoid zone 
   errors during the consolidation. 
    
4.2.2. unit 
 
   The comparison of 2 remote instants needs absolute time. As the 
   measures are typically distributed over Internet there is a need to 
   have an unambiguous and absolute time representation to have more 
   aggregated metrics to be computed automatically.

Internet Draft        IPPM Management Requirements             Sept 2001   
                                     
                                     
    
   The section "6.1. Metrics" of the RFC2330 says that " When a time is 
   given, it will be expressed in UTC".  
    
   The timestamp representation should be in UTC. 
 
 
4.2.3. Packets of Type P 
    
   The section " 13. Packets of Type P" of the RFC2330, introduces "the 
   generic notion of a 'packet of type'"  because "the value of the 
   metric depends on the type of IP packet(s) used to make the 
   measurement." 
    
   The definition part of the measure in the management plane which 
   represent the source or the destination of the packet needs to accept 
   any combination of existing Internet protocols suites. Its design 
   should accept the future Internet protocol combination suites.  
    
4.2.4. Sampling law 
    
   The section "11.1. Methods of Collecting Samples" of the RFC2330 
   presents the different sampling laws. 
 
   The definition part of the measure which represent the sampling law 
   needs to accept the different sampling laws discussed in the RFC2330.  
 
4.3. trustworthiness of the results 
    
   The management plane must define the result format and the rules to 
   qualify the result.  
    
4.3.1. Results definition 
    
   The management plane must specify exhaustively the results of the 
   different measure definitions. It includes the format, the unit and 
   the unusable value transfer rule. 
    
4.3.2. Issues related to time 
    
   The RFC2330 considers that the quality of a result relative to time 
   depends on the clock characteristics which are its accuracy, its 
   skew, its drift and its type of synchronization.  
    
   Result values which represent more the instantaneous variation of the 
   clock than the network behavior are unusable and must be marked as 
   discarded. 
 
   Each result of a measure must be validated against the clock 
   variation. A result may not display values more accurate than it was

   possible at the time of the measure. The result value must be 
   consistent with the accuracy of the clock at the time of the measure. 
 
   The instantaneous characteristics of the clock are part of the 
   measure result. So they must be accessible from the management plan. 
   As the result gathering is delayed the history of the instantaneous 
   characteristics of the clock must be available to the management 
   plan. 
    
    
4.3.3. Sampling law 
    
   To avoid network oscillations introduced by network measures the 
   management plane must be able to tune finely the sampling law 
   parameters of a measure configuration. 
 
   Meshed measures which use periodic or pseudo random sampling law may 
   introduce network oscillation. The management plane must avoid meshed 
   measures to be synchronized. 
    
4.4. End to end troubleshooting 
    
   The management plane performance must be compatible with 
   troubleshooting across administrative areas: 
    
  +   A measure setup must use a limited number of message exchanges.  
    
  +   As troubleshooting must work during network congestion, the 
       management plane should support UDP as transport protocol. 
   
  +   As troubleshooting must work during network congestion a measure 
       setup may be done using a single message. 
 
4.5. Evolution 
    
   The design of the management plane must accept new network and 
   consolidation measures specified in the IPPM WG. 
    
   The Type P must accept the future Internet protocol combination 
   suites. 
    
5. Example using SNMP, the IPPM-MIB 
    
   The requirements listed in this memo are partially respected in the 
   IPPM-MIB draft [3].  
    
   This memo was presented briefly during the IPPM meeting at London. 
   The presentation is available on line in the proceeding of the 51th 
   IETF meeting [4].

6. Security Considerations 
    
   The management plane should provide the interface to manage both the 
   information related to the authentication of the access of the peers 
   to the OWDP-Control and the information related to the OWDP-Control 
   defined in [2].
