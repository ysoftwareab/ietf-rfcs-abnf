ABSTRACT

   This memo describes how to carry text conversation session contents
   in RTP packets. Text conversation session contents is specified in
   ITU-T Recommendation T.140 [1]. 

   Text conversation is used alone or in connection to other
   conversational facilities such as video and voice, to form multimedia
   conversation services.

   This RTP payload description contains an optional possibility to
   include redundant text from already transmitted packets in order to
   reduce the risk of text loss caused by packet loss. The redundancy
   coding follows RFC 2198.

1 Introduction

   This memo defines a payload type for carrying text conversation
   session contents in RTP packets. Text conversation session contents
   are specified in ITU-T Recommendation T.140 [1]. Text conversation is
   used alone or in connection to other conversational facilities such
   as video and voice, to form multimedia conversation services. Text in
   text conversation sessions is sent as soon as it is available, or with
   a small delay of up to 0.5 seconds for buffering.
   The text is supposed to be entered by human users from a keyboard,
   handwriting recognition, voice recognition or any other input method.
   The rate of character entry is usually at a level of a few characters
   per second or less. Therefore, the expected number of characters to
   transmit is low. Only one or a few new characters are expected to be
   transmitted with each packet.

   T.140 specifies that text and other T.140 elements SHALL be
   transmitted in ISO 10 646-1 code with UTF-8 transformation. That
   makes it easy to implement internationally useful applications, and
   to handle the text in modern information technology environments.
   The most common T140 PDU is a character of ISO 10646 text, UTF-8
   coded, submitted from T.140 without any extra framing. 
 
   T.140 requires the transport channel to provide characters without
   duplication and in original order. 
   Text conversation users expect that text will be delivered with no or
   a low level of lost information. If lost information can be replaced
   with a special marker, the willingness to accept loss is expected to
   be higher.
 
   Therefore a mechanism based on RTP is specified here. It gives text
   arrival in correct order, without duplications, with an optional
   possibility to repeat data for redundancy to lower the risk of loss,
   and a mechanism that reveals loss and therefore can insert a marker
   for lost text in the received stream. Since packet overhead is
   usually much larger than the T.140 contents, the increase in channel
   load by the redundancy scheme is minimal. 

1.1 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4]

2. Usage of RTP

   When an unreliable transport of T.140 text session data in a packet
   network is selected, RTP with payload as described in this
   specification should be used. T.140 data is submitted for transmission
   in a number of complete protocol data units (T140 PDU). A T140block
   contains one or more T140 PDU:s.

   A text conversation RTP packet contains an RTP header, a Payload
   Header, OPTIONAL redundant data fields, and the new (primary)
   T.140 data field.

2.1 RTP packet header
   
   Each RTP packet starts with a fixed RTP header. The following fields
   of the RTP fixed header are used for T.140 text streams:

Payload Type (PT): Payload type allocation is dynamic. If redundancy is
   used, the Payload Type SHALL indicate redundancy ("RED") according
   to RFC 2198 [3]. If no redundancy is used, the Payload Type SHALL
   specify the primary T.140 data "T140" payload format. 

Sequence number:  The Sequence Number SHALL be increased with one for
   each new transmitted packet. It is used for detection of packet loss
   and packets out of order, and can be used in the process of retrieval
   of redundant text, reordering of text and marking missing text.

Timestamp: The RTP Timestamp encodes the approximate sampling instance
   of the primary text in the packet. A clock frequency of 1000 Hz SHALL
   be used. No sequential packets SHOULD use the same timestamp. 

2.2 Additional headers

   When redundant data is used, additional headers specify the redundant 
   text fields. They are specified according to RFC 2198 and use dynamic 
   payload type "T140".

2.3 T.140 Text structure

   T.140 text is UTF-8 coded as specified in T.140 with no extra framing.
   When using the format with redundant data, the transmitter MAY
   select a number of T.140 block generations to retransmit in each
   packet. A higher number introduces better protection against loss of
   text. It is RECOMMENDED to use no more than 6 generations. The 
   redundant data is placed in age order with most recent redundant text
   last in the redundance area.
  

3. Recommended procedures

   This section contains RECOMMENDED procedures for usage of the payload
   format.
   Based on the information in the received packets, the receiver can:
      - reorder received text out of order.
      - mark where text is missing because of packet loss.
      - compensate for lost packets by using redundant data.

3.1 Recommended basic procedure   

   On reception, the RTP sequence number is compared with the sequence
   number of the last correctly received packet. If they are consecutive,
   only the most recent t140block is retrieved from the received packet. 


3.2 Recommended procedure for compensation for lost packets.

   For reduction of data loss in case of packet loss, redundant data MAY
   be included in the packets.
   If network conditions are not known, it is RECOMMENDED to use two
   generations of T.140 blocks in the packets. If there is a gap in
   the RTP sequence numbers, and redundancy coded T.140blocks are
   available in the packet, older t140blocks are retrieved from the
   packet up to the point where the sequence number is consecutive to
   the last correctly received packet or no more t140block are available
   in the received packet. 

   Both for the case when redundancy is used and not used, missing data
   SHALL be marked. If there is still a gap in the sequence, one T.140
   missing data marker ( Unicode character 2607 "Lightning") SHALL be
   inserted, UTF-8 coded, replacing each missing t140block. 

3.3 Recommended procedure for compensation for packets out of order.

   For protection against packets arriving out of order, the following
   procedure MAY be implemented in the receiver.
   If analysis of a received packet reveals gaps in the sequence,
   the received packet can be kept in a buffer before being used as
   valid T.140 data. If a packet arrives with a t140block belonging to
   the gap, the gap is filled with the contents of this block. If all
   gaps are filled or the packet is kept in the buffer for 0.5 seconds,
   valid T140blocks in the buffered packet are retrieved and used as
   valid T.140 data. For each t140block still missing, a T.140 missing
   data marker (Unicode character 2607 "Lightning") is inserted. 

3.4 Transmission during "silent periods" when redundancy is used.

   When using the redundancy transmission scheme, and there is nothing
   more to transmit from T.140, the latest t140block has a risk of
   getting old before it is transmitted as redundant data. The result
   is less useful protection against packet loss at the end of a text
   input sequence. For cases where this should be avoided,
   the ISO 10 646 synchronization character FEFF MAY be transmitted
   (UTF-8 coded) after some time of inactivity.

5.  Security Considerations.

    Since the intention of the described payload format is to carry text
    in a text conversation, security measures in the form of encryption
    is of importance. The amount of data in a text conversation session
    is low and therefore any encryption method MAY be selected and
    applied to T.140 session contents or to the whole RTP packets. 
    When redundant data is included, the same security considerations
    as for RFC 2198 apply.
