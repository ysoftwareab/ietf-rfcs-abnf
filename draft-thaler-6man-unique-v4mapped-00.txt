                draft-thaler-6man-unique-v4mapped-00.txt

Abstract

   This document proposes an IPv6 address format for uniquely
   identifying IPv4 destinations.  Today the IPv4-mapped format, when
   used with private IPv4 addresses, does not provide this capability.

Internet-Draft        Unique IPv4-Mapped Addresses         February 2010


1.  Introduction

   The use of non-global ([RFC1918], [RFC3927]) IPv4 addresses presents
   some problems for multihomed nodes, when attached to two networks
   using the same address space.  Typically, the impact is that
   applications can only talk to destinations on one of the two
   networks.  The issue is that the address alone is ambiguous, and
   typical application APIs do not provide a mechanism to distinguish
   between them.

   In IPv6, non-global addresses were also introduced in the form of
   link-local addresses [RFC4291] and unique local addresses [RFC4193]
   (as well as site-local addresses, which were deprecated in
   [RFC3879]).  To resolve the ambiguity, the basic IPv6 APIs were
   defined (in [RFC3493]) to include a "scope id" field, where the scope
   id is defined as a machine-local identifier for a set of interfaces.

   The IPv6 address architecture [RFC4291] also defines an IPv6 address
   format known as an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address, for representing the
   addresses of IPv4 nodes as IPv6 addresses.  These addresses were used
   in the basic IPv6 APIs so that host stacks could let applications use
   the IPv4 stack under an AF_INET6 socket, by using with addresses in
   IPv4-mapped format (for more information see [RFC4038]).  As such,
   IPv4-mapped addresses also have a scope id in socket APIs, and in
   theory this would provide an incentive for applications to use IPv6
   APIs even when talking to IPv4-only destinations.  However, there are
   still several problems with using IPv6 APIs to disambiguate between
   IPv4 destinations.
   1.  [RFC3484] section 3.3 specifies that IPv4-mapped addresses should
       be treated as having global scope for purposes of address
       selection.  As a result, OS's have used a 0 scope id, as with all
       global addresses per [RFC4007] section 11.2.
   2.  [RFC4007] specifies a textual address syntax with an '%'
       character to indicate a scope id.  However, this character is not
       legal in an IPv6 literal within a URI (see [RFC3986] section
       3.2.2).
   3.  Requiring use of a scope id in addition to an address is error
       prone and confusing to developers and end users.  These issues
       are discussed in more detail in [RFC3879] and led to the
       deprecation of site-local addresses.


2.  Address Format

   Unique local addresses [RFC4193] replaced the concept of a machine-
   specific scope id value with a 40-bit shared network-specific
   identifier that was embedded in the address itself.  As a result,
   addresses became unambiguous and were usable without requiring a

   separate scope id.

   We propose applying a similar solution for IPv4-mapped addresses.
   The proposed format of the "Unique IPv4-mapped IPv6 address" is as
   follows:

   |     40 bits       |   40 bits   |16 bits|      32 bits        |
   +-------------------+-------------+-------+---------------------+
   | Well-Known Prefix |  Global ID  | Comp. |    IPv4 address     |
   +----------------+--+-------------+-------+---------------------+

   Well-Known Prefix: The proposed prefix is 0:0:FF00::/40.  The use of
   a well-known prefix allows hosts and applications to easily detect
   this type of address, e.g. to distinguish a native address from one
   involving translation.  (It is for this reason that a ULA is not used
   for this purpose.)  This prefix also ensures that the address range
   cannot conflict with the IPv4-translatable address range defined in
   [RFC2765] section 2.1 (which is ::ffff:0:a.b.c.d).

   Global ID: A Global ID as specified in [RFC4193] section 3.2.  For
   hosts with Unique Local Addresses, the Global ID may be the same
   Global ID as used in the IPv6 unique local addresses on the same
   network.

   Comp.: The 1's complement checksum of the first 80 bits of the
   address, to avoid any changes to the transport protocol's pseudo
   header checksum.

   IPv4 address: The IPv4 address appears in the last 32 bits so that
   dotted-decimal format can be used in the textual representation of an
   address, as defined in [RFC4291] section 2.2.


3.  Security Considerations

   As noted in [RFC4007] section 12, requiring the use of a scope id in
   addition to an address introduced some security complications.  By
   making an IPv4-mapped address unique, these addresses become more
   usable in security contexts.


4.  IANA Considerations

   The Well-Known Prefix falls into the range ::/8 reserved by the IETF.
   Hence this document has no actions for IANA.
