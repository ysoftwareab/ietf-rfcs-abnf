Internet-Draft              Prefix Delegation                   May 2007


Abstract

   In Mobile IPv6 and Proxy Mobile IPv6, one prefix can only be assigned
   to one mobile node by the home agent/ local mobility anchor (HA/LMA)
   and different mobile nodes can not share this home network prefix.
   Managing per-MN home network prefixes is likely to increase the
   processing load at the HA/LMA.  Based on the idea that Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) servers as well as
   Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers can manage
   prefixes, we propose a new technique in which HA/LMA offloads
   delegation and release tasks of the prefixes to the DHCPv6/AAA
   server.  HA/LMA requests a prefix for an incoming mobile node to the
   DHCPv6/AAA server.  Based on this prefix, the mobile node can create
   a home address.  When the mobile station leaves the network, the
   prefix is returned to the DHCPv6/AAA server.

Internet-Draft              Prefix Delegation                   May 2007


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) provides network-based mobility solution
   to the mobile nodes (MN).  MN configures its interface with an
   address from the home network prefix (HNP) topologically anchored at
   MN's local mobility anchor (LMA).  PMIPv6 adopted per-MN prefix model
   where a prefix is only assigned to one MN.  Different MNs can not
   share a prefix, and an MN can have multiple prefixes.  The same
   applies to Mobile IPv6 where due to multi-link subnet issues per-MN
   prefixes must be used in assigning home link prefixes.  However, in
   per-MN prefix model, prefix management is an issue.

   When an MN enters the network, its HA or LMA requests one or more
   prefixes for the MN for MIPv6 or PMIPv6, respectively.  The prefixes
   should be released when the MN leaves the network.  When an operator
   wants to renumber its network, the prefixes with different lifetime
   are advertised to the MN.

   Identity Association for Prefix Delegation (IA_PD) Option enables
   DHCP messages to carry IPv6 prefixes.  The procedure for prefix
   delegation with DHCP which is independent of address assignment with
   DHCP has been defined in [RFC3633].  Therefore DHCPv6 provides a way
   to manage the prefixes.  At the same time, AAA protocols, RADIUS or
   Diameter, can also be used for prefix allocation as defined in
   [RFC4818].

   In this document we propose DHCPv6 or AAA based home network prefix
   allocation to MIPv6/PMIPv6 MNs.  Section 3 describes PMIPv6 home
   network prefix allocation, Section 4 describes Mobile IPv6 home link
   prefix allocation, Section 5 describes how prefixes are released and
   Section 6 presents miscellaneous considerations that apply.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC3315], [RFC3633].
   All MIPv6 related terms are defined in [RFC3775] and PMIPv6 related
   terms are defined in [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6].


3.  PMIPv6 Home Network Prefix Delegation

   We first describe HNP allocation without policy profile/ store
   (defined in [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6]) followed by policy store
   based HNP allocation using DHCP or AAA.

       MN      MAG      LMA      DHCPS

                   Figure 1: Prefix request procedure 1

   Figure 1 illustrates the scenario where MN is assigned a home network
   prefix without a policy store.  In this scenario, LMA has a DHCP
   Client and DHCP Server is connected directly.  DHCP messages need to
   be relayed using DHCP relay function in the LMA if the LMA and DHCP
   server are not connected directly.

   1.  An MN solicits a router advertisement (RtSol) for stateless
       address configuration.
   2.  Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) sends Proxy Binding Update (PBU)
       message to LMA and with HNP to zero.
   3.  LMA as the requesting router initiates DHCP Solicit procedure to
       request prefixes for the MN.  LMA creates and transmits a Solicit
       message as described in sections 17.1.1, "Creation of Solicit
       Messages" and 17.1.2, "Transmission of Solicit Messages" of RFC
       3315.  LMA creates an IA_PD and assigns it an IAID.  LMA MUST
       include the IA_PD option in the Solicit message.

   4.  The DHCP server as the delegating router sends an Advertise
       message to LMA in the same way as described in section 17.2.2,
       "Creation and transmission of Advertise messages" of RFC 3315.
   5.  LMA uses the same message exchanges as described in section 18,
       "DHCP Client-Initiated Configuration Exchange" of RFC 3315 to
       obtain or update prefixes from a DHCP server.  LMA and the DHCP
       server use the IA_PD Prefix option to exchange information about
       prefixes in much the same way as IA Address options are used for
       assigned addresses.
   6.  LMA stores the prefix information it received in the Reply
       message.
   7.  LMA replies PBU with Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (PBA) and sets
       MN's prefix to HNP field of PBA.
   8.  MAG advertises prefixes to MN with Router Advertisement (RA) for
       stateless address configuration.
   9.  The MN starts verifying address uniqueness by sending a Duplicate
       Address Detection (DAD) Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message.

   The corresponding procedure for AAA-based prefix delegation is shown
   in Figure 2.

       MN      MAG      LMA      AAA
         |------>|        |        |      1. RtSol
         |       |------->|        |      2. PBU (HNP=0)
         |       |        |------->|      3. AA-Request

         |<------|        |        |      6. RA(HNP)
         |------>|        |        |      7. DAD NS

                   Figure 2: Prefix request procedure 2

   [RFC4818] defines a RADIUS attribute called Delegated-IPv6-Prefix
   that carries an IPv6 prefix to be delegated.  This attribute is
   usable within either RADIUS or Diameter.  The procedure is shown in
   Figure 2 and explained below.

   1.  MN solicits a router advertisement.
   2.  MAG sends PBU to LMA and sets HNP to zero.
   3.  LMA as Diameter client sends AA-Request message with an MN's
       information to Diameter server.
   4.  If the MN passes the authentication, the Diameter server sends
       AA-Answer message with prefix information to the LMA.  The
       Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute MAY appear in an AA-Request
       packet as a hint by the LMA to the Diameter server that it would
       prefer a prefix, for example, a /48 prefix.  The Diameter server
       MAY delegate a /64 prefix which is an extension of the /48 prefix
       in an AA-Request message containing Delegated-IPv6-Prefix

   In Steps 1-7, MN does network entry and LMA assigns its HNP using
   DHCPv6.  In Step 8, MN requests an address from the local DHCP proxy/
   server colocated in MAG.  MAG sends PBU to LMA with HNP set to zero
   in Step 9 and LMA replies with PBA and sets its HNP parameter in Step
   10.  DHCP Proxy assigns MN-HoA from this prefix and sends it to MN in
   DHCP Reply in Step 11.

   If stateful address configuration is used in PMIPv6 links, prefix
   allocation using AAA can be done as shown in Figure 6.

                   Figure 6: Prefix request procedure 6

   In Steps 1-5, MN does network entry and LMA assigns its HNP using
   AAA.  In Step 6, MN requests an address from the local DHCP proxy/
   server colocated in MAG [I-D.sarikaya-dhc-proxyagent].  MAG sends PBU
   to LMA with HNP set to zero in Step 7 and LMA replies with PBA and
   sets its HNP parameter in Step 8.  DHCP Proxy assigns MN-HoA from
   this prefix and sends it to MN in DHCP Reply in Step 9.

   When MN moves under a different MAG, DHCP Proxy continues to provide
   the same home address to MN.


4.  Mobile IPv6 Home Network Prefix Delegation

   Home agents (HA) MUST use per-MN home network prefixes in order to
   avoid multi-link subnet issues.  Prefix management becomes an issue
   for HAs.  DHCPv6 or AAA based prefix delegation can be used for this
   purpose.

   Mobile IPv6 per-MN prefix delegation procedure is shown in Figure 7
   using DHCPv6.

       uses HoA in sending a Binding Update (BU) message to register its
       care of address.
   8.  The care of address configuration.
   9.  The care of address configuration.

   Note that home address can be assigned during the bootstrapping
   process and downloaded into the AR as part of the policy store.  In
   this case, HA will be triggered by HAAA-HA protocol and HA MUST get a
   per-MN prefix from DHCP server using steps 3-6 in Figure 7 and MUST
   assign HoA from this prefix.

   MN can receive the bootstrapping parameters by sending DHCP Info-
   Request message and receiving DHCP Info-Reply message.

   MIPv6 per-MN prefix delegation procedure using AAA is similar to
   Figure 7 except that instead of Steps 3-6, Steps 3-4 in Figure 2 are
   executed.

                      Figure 8: PMIPv6 Prefix Release

   Prefixes can be released in two ways, prefix aging or DHCP release
   procedure.  In the former way, a prefix SHOULD not be used by an MN
   when the prefix ages, and the DHCP Server can delegate it to another
   MN.  A prefix lifetime is delivered from the DHCPv6 server to the
   requesting router (HA or LMA) through DHCP IA_PD Prefix option
   [RFC3633] and RA Prefix Information option [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis].

   We first describe PMIPv6 prefix release procedure followed by MIPv6
   release procedure.

   Figure 8 illustrates how LMA releases prefixes to an DHCP Server:

   1.  An MN detachment signaling, such as switch-off or handover,
       triggers prefix release procedure.
   2.  MAG sends PBU with lifetime set to zero.
   3.  LMA replies with PBA.
   4.  LMA initiates a Release message to give back the prefixes to the
       DHCP server.
   5.  The server responds with a Reply message, and then the prefixes
       can be reused by other MNs.

   If PMIPv6 and MIPv6 are being used by the same MN and HA also
   supports LMA functionality as described in
   [I-D.devarapalli-netlmm-pmipv6-mipv6] the same binding cache entry
   for the MN is sometimes modified by the MN or by a MAG.  Because of
   this, at Step 4 in Figure 8, if the HA colocated with LMA receives a
   MIPv6 registration message (BU), LMA MUST not release the prefix(es).

   In case of Mobile IPv6, Figure 9 can be used to release prefixes.

        MN        HA       DHCPS
         |------->|        |    1. BU (lifetime=0)
         |<-------|        |    2. BA
         |        |------->|    3. DHCP Release (HNP)
         |        |<-------|    4. DHCP Reply

   HA MUST release MN's home link prefix when MN returns home and sends
   a Binding Update message with the lifetime set to zero and receives a
   Binding Acknowledgement (BA) message back.  The prefix release
   signaling is as shown in Figure 9.

   If PMIPv6 and MIPv6 are being used by the same MN and LMA also
   supports HA functionality as described in
   [I-D.devarapalli-netlmm-pmipv6-mipv6] the same binding cache entry
   for the MN is sometimes modified by the MN or by a MAG.  Because of
   this, at Step 3 in Figure 9, if the LMA colocated with HA receives a
   PMIPv6 registration PBU, HA MUST not release the prefix(es).

   For RADIUS, when the MN exits the network, the LMA release the MN's
   prefixes through Accounting Stop message [RFC2866].  For Diameter,
   the LMA release prefixes through Accounting-Request[RFC3588].

   MAG MUST advertise the prefix(es) to MN in RA message.

   Site renumbering is an open issue for RADIUS/ Diameter protocols to
   manage prefixes.  [RFC3576] MAY be used for renumbering.


6.  Miscellaneous Considerations

   The considerations on how to generate IAIDs and to delegate prefixes
   described in [I-D.sarikaya-16ng-prefix-delegation] on the access
   routers (AR) apply here on the local mobility anchors (LMA) and the
   home agents (HA).


7.  Security Considerations

   This draft introduces no additional messages.  Comparing to
   [RFC3633], [RFC2865] and [RFC3588] there is no additional threats to
   be introduced.  DHCPv6, RADIUS and Diameter security procedures
   apply.


8.  IANA consideration

   None.
