1.  Introduction

   This document updates [RFC4271] by revising control mechanism which
   limit the negative impact of route leaks [RFC7908] and/or resource
   exhaustion in Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) implementations.  While
   [RFC4271] described methods to tear down BGP sessions or discard
   UPDATES after certain thresholds are exceeded, some nuances in this
   specification were missing resulting in inconsistencies between BGP
   implementations.

2.  Changes to RFC4271 Section 6

   This section updates [RFC4271] to specify what events can result in
   AutomaticStop (Event 8) in the BGP FSM.

   The following paragraph replaces the second paragraph of Section 6.7
   (Cease), which starts with "A BGP speaker MAY support" and ends with
   "The speaker MAY also log this locally.":

      A BGP speaker MAY support the ability to impose a locally-
      configured, upper bound on the number of address prefixes the
      speaker is willing to accept from a neighbor (inbound maximum

      prefix limit).  The limit on the prefixes accepted from a neighbor
      can be applied before policy processing (Pre-Policy) or after
      policy processing (Post-Policy).  When the upper bound is reached,
      the speaker, under control of local configuration, either:

      a.  Discards new address prefixes from the neighbor, while
          maintaining the BGP connection.  As these prefixes are
          discared, their reachability information is not stored on the
          local router, which might lead to inconsistent routing
          behaviour;

      b.  Receives all the new prefixes exceeding the threshold, accepts
          them and generates a log of the event;

      c.  Terminates the BGP connection with the neighbor.

      If the BGP speaker decides to terminate its BGP connection with a
      neighbor because the number of address prefixes received from the
      neighbor exceeds the locally-configured, upper bound, then the
      speaker MUST send the neighbor a NOTIFICATION message with the
      Error Code Cease.

      The speaker MAY also log this locally.

3.  Changes to RFC4271 Section 8

   This section updates Section 8 [RFC4271], the paragraph that starts
   with "One reason for an AutomaticStop event is" and ends with "The
   local system automatically disconnects the peer." is replaced with:

      Possible reasons for an AutomaticStop event are: A BGP speaker
      receives an UPDATE messages with a number of prefixes for a given
      peer such that the total prefixes received exceeds the maximum
      number of prefixes configured (either "Pre-Policy" or "Post-
      Policy").  The local system automatically disconnects the peer.

4.  Changes to RFC4271 Section 9

   This section updates [RFC4271] by adding a subsection after
   Section 9.4 (Originating BGP routes) to specify various events that
   can lead up to AutomaticStop (Event 8) in the BGP FSM.

      9.5 Maximum Prefix Limits

      9.5.1 Pre-Policy Inbound Maximum Prefix Limits

         The Adj-RIB-In stores routing information learned from inbound
         UPDATE messages that were received from another BGP speaker
         Section 3.2 [RFC4271].  The pre-policy limit uses the number of
         NLRIs per Address Family Identifier (AFI) per Subsequent
         Address Family Identifier (SAFI) as input into its threshold
         comparisons.  For example, when an operator configures the pre-
         policy limit for IPv4 Unicast to be 50 on a given EBGP session,
         and the other BGP speaker announces its 51st IPv4 Unicast NLRI,
         the session MUST be terminated.

         Pre-policy limits are particularly useful to help dampen the
         effects of full table route leaks and memory exhaustion when
         the implementation stores rejected routes.

         Operators SHOULD take special care when utilizing methods where
         the router maintains a table of all the received updates pre-
         policy, as this could still expose control plane to exhaustion
         if no pre-policy limits are available or are not configured.
         Implementations SHOULD provide means to configure two
         thresholds for inbound limits, one before policies are applied,
         and one after.  This is to prevent exhaustion of control plane
         resources.  The threshold before policy SHOULD be higher than
         or equal to the limit configured after policy.

      9.5.2 Post-Policy Inbound Maximum Prefix Limits

         RFC4271 describes a Policy Information Base (PIB) that contains
         local policies that can be applied to the information in the
         Routing Information Base (RIB).  The post-policy limit uses the
         number of NLRIs per Address Family Identifier (AFI) per
         Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), after application
         of the Import Policy as input into its threshold comparisons.
         For example, when an operator configures the post-policy limit
         for IPv4 Unicast to be 50 on a given EBGP session, and the
         other BGP speaker announces a hundred IPv4 Unicast routes of
         which none are accepted as a result of the local import policy
         (and thus not considered for the Loc-RIB by the local BGP
         speaker), the session is not terminated.

Internet-Draft      BGP Maximum Prefix Limits Inbound       January 2022


         Post-policy limits are useful to help prevent FIB exhaustion
         and prevent accidental BGP session teardown due to prefixes not
         accepted by policy anyway.

5.  Security Considerations

   Maximum Prefix Limits are an essential tool for routing operations
   and SHOULD be used to increase stability for the global routing
   ecosystem.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests that IANA updates the name of subcode "Maximum
   Number of Prefixes Reached" to "Threshold exceeded: Maximum Number of
   Prefixes Received" in the "Cease NOTIFICATION message subcodes"
   registry under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" group.

8.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC7942.  The
   description of implementations in this section is intended to assist
   the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
   Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here
   does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has
   been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied
   by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be
   construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   The below table provides an overview (as of the moment of writing) of
   which vendors have produced implementation of inbound prefix limits.
   Each table cell shows the applicable configuration keywords if the
   vendor implemented the feature.
