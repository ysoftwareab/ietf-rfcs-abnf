1.  Introduction

   STARTTLS [RFC3207] defines how to send an email over an SMTP
   [RFC5321] encrypted session between two mail servers.

   This memo thus registers an additional reporting property allowing a
   TLS result to be relayed as an annotation in a message header.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Discussion

   STARTTLS [RFC3207] defines how to send an email over an encrypted
   session between two mail servers, Message Transfer Agent (MTA), using
   the TLS [RFC5246] protocol.

   Most of these exchanges are opportunistic, meaning a best effort is
   done to establish an encrypted message exchange regardless of the
   strength of the cipher or the validity of the certificates used.
   However, the results of this negotiation should be recorded in the
   message via the Authentication-Results header [RFC7001] to indicate
   to other message processing algorithms, including Messaging User
   Agents (MUA), how securely this message was transmitted from the MTA
   client to the MTA server.

   The concept of authentication here is related to the presentation of
   a certificate which is verified valid by a set of trusted Certificate

   Authorithies (CA), via DANE [RFC6698] or by local policy.  This does
   not indicate that any string in the certificate is related to any
   string in the email.

2.  Definitions

   This memo adds to the "Email Authentication Methods" registry,
   created by IANA upon publication of [RFC7001], the following:

   o  The method "tls"; and

   o  Associated with that method, the properties (reporting items)
      "policy.cert_client", "policy.cert_server", "policy.cert_verif",
      "policy.tls_v", "policy.key_ciphersuite", "policy.key_fingerprint"
      and "policy.key_strength".

2.1.  results meaning

   The "tls" method can have the following results:

   none: the message was sent in clear.

   pass: the message was sent encrypted and the client certificate was
   verified valid either using a trusted CA or via DANE [RFC6698].

   selfsigned: the message was sent encrypted but the client certificate
   is self signed.

   fail: the message was sent encrypted but the client certificate is
   not valid.  It is advised to use comments to indicate the nature of
   the problem like certifcate expired, not linked to a trusted CA,...

   temperror: the message was sent encrypted and the server was not able
   to verify the client certificate at this time.  This may indicate for
   instance that the server could not fetch the CRL.

   permerror: the message was sent encrypted and the client certificate
   was not verified by the MTA server.

2.2.  properties

   policy.cert_client: the subject of the X.509 certificate used by the
   client to initiate TLS.

   policy.cert_server: the subject of the X.509 certificate used by the
   server to initiate TLS (optional).

   policy.cert_verif: the type of certification performed: CA, DANE
   [RFC6698], LOCAL (optional).

   policy.tls_v: the ptotocol version used to encrypt SSL2.0, SSL3.0,
   TLS1.0, TLS1.1,... (optional)

   policy.key_ciphersuite: the description of the TLS cipher suite used
   as defined in the IANA cipher suite registry.

   policy.key_fingerprint: the fingerprint of the key used (optional).

   policy.key_strength: as many SMTP TLS are opportunistic in nature
   this property is an arbitrary value set by the MTA server to indicate
   the strength of the encryption (optional).

   While ciphers strength vary overtime, and key length in bits does not
   indicate a comparable strength between various cyphers, it may be
   difficult for all the processors of the authentication-results header
   to redo the analysis based on the cipher used and all to arrive to
   the same conclusion.  It seems, therefore, best if the receiving MTA
   does that analysis and communicate it to the other layers.  This is
   the purpose of the key.strength.
