   -  Bring references up to date, include all drafts
      referenced from this document, and exclude those that
      are not referenced.
   
   -- Provide support for monitoring tunnel resources in
      GMPLS systems.  For example, SONET/SDH or G.709.  This
      might be done through an arbitrary RowPointer to an
      external MIB.
   
   -  Extend mplsTrafficParamsTable from the MPLS-LSR-MIB to
      support GMPLS traffic parameters for signaled and
      static LSPs.
   
   -  Extendthe performance tables from the MPLS-LSR-MIB for
      technology-specific GMPLS LSPs.


2. Introduction
   
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information
   Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes
   managed objects for Generalized Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (GMPLS) [GMPLSArch] Label Switching Routers
   (LSRs).
   
   Comments should be made directly to the CCAMP mailing
   list at ccamp@ops.ietf.org.
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
   "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in RFC 2119, reference
   [RFC2119].


2.1.  Migration Strategy
   
   This MIB extends  the Label Switching Router MIB defined
   for use with MPLS [LSRMIB].  The only changes made are
   additions for support of GMPLS or changes that are
   necessary to support the increased complexity of a GMPLS
   system.
   
   The companion document modeling and managing GMPLS based
   traffic engineering [GMPLSTEMIB] extends the MPLS TE MIB
   [TEMIB] with the same intentions.
   
   Textual conventions and OBJECT-IDENTIFIERS are defined in
   [GMPLSTCMIB] which extends the set of textual conventions

   originally defined in [TCMIB].


3. The SNMP Management Framework
   
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five
   major components:
   
   -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571
      [RFC2571].
   
   -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and
      events for the purpose of management.  The first
      version of this Structure of Management Information
      (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC
      1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and STD 16,
      RFC 1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2,
      is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58,
      RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].
   
   -  Message protocols for transferring management
      information.  The first version of the SNMP message
      protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC
      1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the SNMP message
      protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
      [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version
      of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described
      in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574
      [RFC2574].
   
   -  Protocol operations for accessing management
      information.  The first set of protocol operations and
      associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC
      1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol operations
      and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [RFC1905].
   
   -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC
      2573 [RFC2573] and the view-based access control
      mechanism described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].
   
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP
   Management Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
   store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
   defined in the SMI.

Internet Draft               GMPLS-LSR-MIB              June 24, 2002



   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the
   SMIv2.  A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced
   through the appropriate translations.  The resulting
   translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except
   where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into
   textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation
   process.  However, this loss of machine readable
   information is not considered to change the semantics of
   the MIB.


4. Terminology
   
   This document uses terminology from the document
   describing the MPLS architecture [RFC3031].
   
   A label switched path (LSP) is modeled as a connection
   consisting of one or more incoming segments (in-segments)
   and/or one or more outgoing segments (out-segments) at a
   Label Switching Router (LSR).  The association or
   interconnection of the in-segments and out-segments is
   accomplished by using a cross-connect.  We use the
   terminology "connection" and "LSP" interchangeably where
   the meaning is clear from the context.


5. Feature List
   
   The GMPLS Label Switching Router MIB is designed to
   satisfy the following requirements and constraints in
   addition to those addressed by the MPLS LSR MIB:
   
   -  The MIB supports both manually configured LSPs as well
      as those configured via any GMPLS signaling protocol.
   
   -  The MIB supports the enabling and disabling of GMPLS
      capability on MPLS capable interfaces of an LSR.


6. Summary of LSR MIB
   
   The MIB tables in this draft are:
   
   -  The interface configuration table
      (gmplsInterfaceConfTable), which extends
      mplsInterfaceConfTable to enable the GMPLS protocol on
      MPLS-capable interfaces.

Internet Draft               GMPLS-LSR-MIB              June 24, 2002



   -  The in-segment (gmplsInSegmentTable) and out-segment
      (gmplsOutSegmentTable) tables extend
      mplsInSegmentTable and mplsOutSegmentTable to
      configuring GMPLS-specific parameters for LSP segments
      at an LSR.
   
   -  The gmplsLabelTable extends mplsLabelTable and allows
      Generalized Labels to be defined and managed in a
      central location.  Generalized Labels can be of
      variable length and have distinct bit-by-bit
      interpretations according to the use that is made of
      them.
   
   These tables are described in the subsequent sections.


7. Bidirectional LSPs
   
   This MIB supports bidirectional LSPs as required for
   GMPLS.
   
   A single entry in the mplsXCIndex is shared by all of the
   segments for the entire bidirectional LSP.  This
   facilitates a simple reference from [TEMIB] and
   [GMPLSTEMIB], and makes fate-sharing more obvious.
   
   It is, however, important that the direction of segments
   is understood to avoid connecting all in-segments to all
   out-segments.  This is achieved by an object in each
   segment that indicates the direction of the segment with
   respect to data flow.
   
   A segment that is marked as 'forward' carries data from
   the 'head' of the LSP to the 'tail'.  A segment marked as
   'reverse' carries data in the reverse direction.
   
   Where an LSP is signaled using a conventional signaling
   protocol, the 'head' of the LSP is the source of the
   signaling (also known as the ingress) and the 'tail' is
   the destination (also known as the egress).  For manually
   configured LSPs an arbitrary decision must be made about
   which segments are 'forward' and which 'reverse'.  For
   consistency this decision should be made across all LSRs
   that participate in the LSP by assigning 'head' and
   'tail' ends to the LSP.


8. Example of LSP Setup
   
   In this section we provide a brief example of using the

Internet Draft               GMPLS-LSR-MIB              June 24, 2002



   MIB objects described in section 9. to set up an LSP.
   While this example is not meant to illustrate every
   nuance of the MIB, it is intended as an aid to
   understanding some of the key concepts.  It is meant to
   be read after going through the MIB itself.  A
   prerequisite is an understanding of [LSRMIB].
   
   Suppose that one would like to manually create a best-
   effort, bi-directional LSP.  Assume that, in the forward
   direction, the LSP enters the LSR via MPLS interface A
   with ifIndex 12 and exits the LSR via MPLS interface B
   with ifIndex 13.  For the reverse direction, we assume
   the LSP enters via interface B and leaves via interface A
   (i.e. the forward and reverse directions use the same bi-
   directional interfaces).  Let us also assume that we do
   not wish to have a label stack beneath the top label on
   the outgoing labeled packets.  The following example
   illustrates which rows and corresponding objects might be
   created to accomplish this.
   
   First, the traffic parameter entries must be set-up for
   both segments.  These are configured entirely in the MPLS
   LSR MIB through the mplsTrafficParamTable.
   
   Note that for a bi-directional LSP, the segments in the
   reverse direction MAY share the traffic parameter entries
   (and hence resources) with the segments in the forward
   direction.
   
   We must next create the appropriate in-segment and out-
   segment entries with suitable traffic parameters by
   pointing to the appropriate traffic parameter entries
   that we have just created.  This is also done in the MPLS
   LSR MIB using mplsInSegmentTable and mplsOutSegmentTable.
   
   These table entries are extended by entries in
   gmplsInSegmentTable and gmplsOutSegmentTable.  Note that
   the nature of the 'extends' relationship is that the
   entry in gmplsInSegmentTable has the same index values as
   the entry in mplsInSegmentTable.  Similarly, the entry in
   gmplsOutSegmentTable has the same index values as the
   entry in mplsOutSegmentTable.
   
   First for the forward direction:
   
   In gmplsInSegmentTable
   {
     gmplsInSegmentDirection          = forward (1),
   }

Internet Draft               GMPLS-LSR-MIB              June 24, 2002



   In gmplsOutSegmentTable
   {
     gmplsOutSegmentDirection         = forward (1)
   }
   
   Next for the reverse direction:
   
   In gmplsInSegmentTable
   {
     gmplsInSegmentDirection          = reverse (2)
   }
   
   In gmplsOutSegmentTable
   {
     gmplsOutSegmentDirection         = reverse (2)
   }
   
   Next, two cross-connect entries are created in the
   mplsXCTable of the MPLS LSR MIB, thereby associating the
   newly created segments together.

11.   Security Considerations
   
   It is clear that this MIB is potentially useful for
   monitoring of MPLS LSRs.  This MIB can also be used for
   configuration of certain objects, and anything that can
   be configured can be incorrectly configured, with
   potentially disastrous results.
   
   There are a number of management objects defined in this
   MIB that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or
   read-create. Such objects may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments. The support for
   SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network
   operations.
   
   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that
   may contain information that may be sensitive from a
   business perspective, in that they represent a customer's
   interface to the MPLS network.  Allowing uncontrolled
   access to these objects could result in malicious and
   unwanted disruptions of network traffic or incorrect
   configurations for these customers.  There are no objects
   that are particularly sensitive in their own right, such
   as passwords or monetary amounts.
   
   It is thus important to control even GET access to these
   objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
   object when sending them over the network via SNMP. Not
   all versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure
   environment.
   
   At this writing, no security holes have been identified
   beyond those that SNMP Security [RFC2571] is itself
   intended to address.  These relate to primarily
   controlled access to sensitive information and the
   ability to configure a device - or which might result
   from operator error, which is beyond the scope of any
   security architecture.
   
   SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 are by themselves not a secure
   environment. Even if the network itself is secure (for
   example by using IPSec [RFC2401]), there is no control as
   to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read, change, create and/or delete) the objects
   in this MIB. It is recommended that the implementers
   consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3
   framework. Specifically, the use of the User-based

Internet Draft               GMPLS-LSR-MIB              June 24, 2002



   Security Model [RFC2574] and the View-based Access
   Control [RFC2575] is recommended. It is then a
   customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB is
   properly configured to give access to the objects only to
   those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to
   indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   This draft is based heavily on [LSRMIB].  The authors
   would like to express their gratitude to all those who
   worked on that earlier MIB.
   
   The authors would like to express their thanks to Dan
   Joyle for his careful review and comments on GMPLS
   labels.
