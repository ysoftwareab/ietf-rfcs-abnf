Abstract

   Customers are frequently required to enter substantial amounts of
   information at an Internet merchant site in order to complete a
   purchase or other transaction, especially the first time they go
   there. A standard set of information fields is defined as the first
   version of an Electronic Commerce Modeling Language (ECML) so that
   this task can be more easily automated, for example by wallet
   software that could fill in fields.  Even for the manual data entry
   case, customers will be less confused by varying merchant sites if a
   substantial number adopt these standard fields.

1. Introduction

1.1 Background

   Today, numerous merchants are successfully conducting business on the
   Internet using HTML-based forms. The data formats used in these forms
   varies considerably from one merchant to another. End-users find the
   diversity confusing and the process of manually filling in these
   forms to be tedious.  The result is that many merchant forms,
   reportedly around two thirds, are abandoned during the fill in
   process.

   Software tools called electronic wallets can help this situation.  A
   digital wallet is an application or service that assists consumers in
   conducting online transactions by allowing them to store billing,
   shipping, payment, and preference information and to use this
   information to automatically complete merchant interactions.  This
   greatly simplifies the check-out process and minimizes the need for a
   consumer to complete a merchant's form every time.  Digital wallets
   that fill forms have been successfully built into browsers, as helper
   applications to browsers, as stand-alone applications, as browser
   plug-ins, and as server-based applications.  But the proliferation of
   electronic wallets has been hampered by the lack of standards.

   ECML (Electronic Commerce Modeling Language, <www.ecml.org>) Version
   1 provides a set of simple guidelines for web merchants that will
   enable electronic wallets from multiple vendors to fill in their web
   forms. The end-result is that more consumers will find shopping on
   the web to be easy and compelling.

1.2 Relationship to Other Standards

   ECML Version 1 is not a replacement or alternative to SSL/TLS [RFC
   2246], SET [SET], XML [XML], or IOTP [draft-ietf-trade-iotp-v1.0-
   protocol-*.txt]. These are important standards that provide
   functionality such as non-repudiatable transactions, automatable
   payment scheme selection, and smart card support.

   ECML may be used with any payment mechanism.  It simply allows a
   merchant to publish consistent simple web forms.

   Multiple wallets and multiple merchants plan to interoperably support
   ECML.  This is an open standard. ECML is designed to be simple.
   Version 1 of the project adds no new technology to the web.  A
   merchant can adopt ECML and gain the support of these multiple
   Wallets by making very simple changes to the HTML pages that they

D. Eastlake, T. Goldstein                                       [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT              ECom Field Names               June 14, 1999

   currently use to support their customers.  Use of ECML requires no
   license.

   The set of fields documented herein was developed by the
   Wallet/Merchant Standards Alliance (www.emcl.org) which now includes,
   in alphabetic order, the following:

             American Express (www.americanexpress.com>
             AOL (www.aol.com)
             Compaq (www.compaq.com)
             CyberCash (www.cybercash.com)
             IBM (www.ibm.com)
             Mastercard (www.mastercard.com)
             Microsoft (www.microsoft.com)
             SETCo (www.setco.org)
             Sun Microsystems (www.sun.com)
             Transactor (www.transactor.com)
             Trintech (www.trintech.com>
             Visa (www.visa.com)

   The fields are derived from and consistent with the W3C P3P base data
   schema at

        <http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-P3P/basedata.html>.

1.3 Areas Deferred to Future Versions

   Standardization of information fields from the merchant to the
   consumer, considerations for business purchasing cards, non-card
   payment mechanisms, wallet activation, privacy related mechanisms,
   and any sort of "negotiation" were among the areas deferred to
   consideration in future versions.  Hidden or other special fields
   were minimized.  The primary target was North American consumer to
   merchant electronic commerce.

2. Using The Fields

   To conform to this document, the field names shall be as listed in
   section 3 below.  Note: this does not impose any restriction on the
   user visible labeling of fields, just on their names as used in
   communication with the merchant.

D. Eastlake, T. Goldstein                                       [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT              ECom Field Names               June 14, 1999

2.1 Presentation of the Fields

   There is no necessary implication as to the order or manner of
   presentation.  Some merchant may wish to ask for more information,
   some less.  Some merchant may ask for the information they want in
   one HTML form on one web page, others may ask for parts of the
   information at different times on different pages.  For example, it
   is common to ask for "ship to" information earlier, so shipping cost
   can be computed, before the payment method information.  Some
   merchants may require that all the information they request be
   provided while other make much information optional.  Etc.

   There is no way with version 1 of ECML to indicate what fields the
   merchant considers mandatory.  From the point of view of customer
   software, all fields are optional to complete.  However, the merchant
   may give an error or re-present a request for information if some
   field it requires is not completed, just as it may if a field is
   completed in a manner it considers erroneous.

2.2 Methods and Flow of Setting the Fields

   There are a variety of methods of communication possible between the
   customer and the merchant by which the merchant can indicate what
   fields they want that the consumer can provide.  Probably the easiest
   to use for currently deployed software is as fields in an HTML [RFC
   1866] form.  Other possibilities are to use the W3C P3P protocol or
   the IOTP Authenticate transaction [draft-ietf-trade-iotp-v1.0-
   protocol-*.txt].

   User action or the appearance of the Ecom_SchemaVersion field are
   examples of triggers that could be used to initiate a facility
   capable of filling in fields.  It is required that the
   Ecom_SchemaVersion field, which is usually a hidden field, be
   included on every web page that has any "Ecom_" fields.

   Because web pages can load very slowly, it may not be clear to an
   automated field fill-in function when it is finished filling in
   fields on a web page.  For this reason, it is recommended that the
   Ecom_SchemaVersion field be the last "Ecom_" field on a web page.

   Merchant requests for information can extend over several web pages.
   Without further provision, a facility could either require re-
   starting on each page or possibly violate or appear to violate
   privacy by continuing to fill in fields for pages beyond with end of
   the transaction with a particular merchant.  For this reason the
   Ecom_TransactionComplete field, which is normally hidden, is
   provided.  It is recommended that it appear on the last web page
   involved in a transaction, just before an Ecom_SchemaVersion field,

D. Eastlake, T. Goldstein                                       [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT              ECom Field Names               June 14, 1999

   so that multi-web-page automated field fill in logic could know when
   to stop if it chooses to check for this.

2.3 HTML Example

   An example in HTML might be as follows:

   <HTML>
   <HEAD>
   <title> eCom Fields Example </title>
   </HEAD>
   <BODY>
    <FORM action="http://ecom.example.com" method="POST">
   Please enter card information:
   <p>Your name on the card
     <INPUT type="text" name="Ecom_Payment_Card_Name" SIZE=40>
   <br>The card number
     <INPUT type="text" name="Ecom_Payment_Card_Number" SIZE=19>
   <br>Expiration date (MM YY)
     <INPUT type="text" name="Ecom_Payment_Card_ExpDate_Month" SIZE=2>
     <INPUT type="text" name="Ecom_Payment_Card_ExpDate_Year" SIZE=4>
    <INPUT type="hidden" name="Ecom_Payment_Card_Protocols">
    <INPUT type="hidden" name="Ecom_SchemaVersion"
           value="http://www.emcl.org/version/1.0">
   <br>
    <INPUT type="submit" value="submit"> <INPUT type="reset">
    </FORM>
   </BODY>
   </HTML>

   After all of the pages are submitted, the merchant will reply with a
   confirmation page informing both the user and the wallet that the
   transaction is complete.

   <HTML>
   <HEAD>
   <title> eCom Transaction Complete Example </title>
   </HEAD>
   <BODY>
    <FORM>
    Thank you for your order. It will be shipped in several days.
    <INPUT type="hidden" name="Ecom_TransactionComplete">
    <INPUT type="hidden" name="Ecom_SchemaVersion"
           value="http://www.emcl.org/version/1.0">
    </FORM>
   </BODY>
   </HTML>

3. Field Definitions

   The fields are listed below along with the minimum data entry size to
   allow.  Note that these fields are hierarchically organized as
   indicated by the embedded underscore ("_") characters.  Appropriate
   consumer to merchant transmission mechanisms may use this to request
   and send aggregates, such as Ecom_Payment_Card_ExpDate to encompass
   all the date components or Ecom_ShipTo to encompass all the ship to
   components that the consumer is willing to provide.  The marshalling
   and unmarshalling of the components of such aggregates depends on the
   data transfer protocol used.

   IMPORTANT NOTE: "MIN" in the table below is the MINIMUM DATA SIZE TO
         ALLOW FOR ON DATA ENTRY.  It is NOT the minimum size for valid
         contents of the field and merchant software should, in most
         cases, be prepared to receive a longer or shorter value.
         Merchant dealing with areas where, for example, the
         state/province name or phone number is longer than the "Min"
         given below must obviously permit longer data entry.  In some
         cases, however, there is a maximum size that makes sense and
         where this is the case, it is documented in a Note for the
         field.

      FIELD                      NAME                        Min  Notes

   IMPORTANT NOTE: "MIN" in the table above is the MINIMUM DATA SIZE TO
         ALLOW FOR ON DATA ENTRY.  It is NOT the minimum size for valid
         contents of the field and merchant software should, in most
         cases, be prepared to receive a longer or shorter value.
         Merchant dealing with areas where, for example, the
         state/province name or phone number is longer than the "Min"
         given below must obviously permit longer data entry.  In some
         cases, however, there is a maximum size that makes sense and
         this is documented in a Note for the field.

   FOOT NOTES

   ( 1) For example: Mr., Mrs., Ms., Dr. This field is commonly not
   used.

   ( 2) May also be used for middle initial

   ( 3) For example: Ph.D., Jr. (Junior), 3rd, Esq. (Esquire). This
   field is commonly not used.

   ( 4) Address lines must be filled in the order line1, then line2,
   last line3.

   ( 5) 2 characters are the minimum for the US and Canada, other
   countries may require longer fields.  For the US use 2 character US
   Postal state abbreviation.

   ( 6) Minimum field lengths for Postal Code will vary based on
   international market served.  Use 5 character or 5+4 ZIP for the US
   and 6 character postal code for Canada.  The size given, 14, is
   believed to be the maximum required anywhere in the world.

   ( 7) Use [ISO 3166] standard two letter codes
   <http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1.html> for
   country names.

   ( 8) 10 digits are the minimum for numbers local to the North
   American Numbering Plan (<http://www.nanpa.com>: US, Canada and a
   number of smaller Caribbean and Pacific nations (but not Cuba)),
   other countries may require longer fields.  Telephone numbers are
   complicated by differing international access codes, variant
   punctuation of area/city codes within countries, confusion caused by
   the fact that the international access code in the NANP region is
   usually the same as the "country code" for that area (1), etc.  It
   will probably be necessary to use heuristics or human examination
   based on the telephone number and addresses given to figure out how
   to actually call a customer. It is recommend that an "x" be placed
   before extension numbers.

   ( 9) For example:  jsmith@isp.com

   (10) The name of the cardholder.

   (11)  Use the first 4 letters of the association name: American
   Express=AMER; Diners Club=DINE; Discover=DISC; JCB=JCB;
   Mastercard=MAST; Visa=VISA.

   (12) Includes the check digit at end but no spaces or hyphens [ISO
   7812].  The Min given, 19, is the longest number permitted under the
   standard.

   (13) An additional cardholder verification number printed on the card
   (but not embossed or recorded on the magnetic stripe) such as
   American Express' CIV, MasterCard's CVC2, and Visa's CVV2 values.

   (14) The day of the month. Values: 1-31

   (15) The month of the year.  Jan - 1, Feb - 2, March - 3, etc.;
   Values: 1-12

   (16) The value in the wallet cell is always four digits, e.g., 1999,
   2000, 2001, ...

   (17) A space separated list of protocols available in connection with
   the specified card.  Initial list of case insensitive tokens: none,
   set, & setcert.  "Set" indicates usable with SET protocol (i.e., is
   in a SET wallet) but does not have a SET certificate.  "Setcert"
   indicates same but does have a set certificate.  "None" indicates
   that automatic field fill is operating but there is no SET wallet or
   the card is not entered in any SET wallet.

   (18) A unique order ID generated by the consumer software.

   (19) URI indicating version of this set of fields.  Usually a hidden
   field.  Equal to "http://www.ecml.org/version/1.0" for this version.

   (20) A flag to indicate that this web-page/aggregate is the final one
   for this transaction.  Usually a hidden field.

4. Security Considerations

   The information called for by many of these fields is sensitive and
   should be protected if being sent over the public Internet or through
   other channels where it can be observed.  Mechanisms for such
   protection are not specified herein but channel encryption such as
   SSL/TLS [RFC 2246] or IPSec [RFC 2411] would be appropriate in many
   cases.

   User control over release of such information is needed to protect
   the user's privacy.

   Any multi-web-page or other multi-aggregate field fill in or data
   provision mechanism should check for the Ecom_TransactionComplete
   field and cease automated fill when it is encountered until fill is
   further authorized.
