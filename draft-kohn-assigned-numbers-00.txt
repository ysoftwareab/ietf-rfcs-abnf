   other groups may also distribute working documents as
   Internet-Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
   months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents
   at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

Internet-Draft              Assigned Numbers              September 2000


1. Overview

   IANA houses the many unique parameters and protocol values necessary
   for the operation of the Internet and its future development.  Types
   of numbers range from unique port assignments to the registration of
   character sets.  Guidelines for creation and management of name
   spaces are described in [RFC2434]. In the past, these numbers were
   documented through the RFC document series.  The last of these
   documents was [RFC1700], which this document obsoletes.

   Since that time, the assignments have been listed in
   <http://www.iana.org/numbers.html> as living documents, which are
   regularly updated and revised when new information is available and
   new assignments are made.

   It is believed that the avoidance of potential interoperability
   problems due to implementations relying on out of date assigned
   numbers from an RFC overwhelms the value of having an occasional
   archival record. Document authors are advised to reference the URL
   of the relevant name/number assignment on the IANA site directly,
   rather than referring to this document, to ensure that implementers
   receive up to date information.

   IANA may be contacted at iana@iana.org or through
   <http://www.iana.org/contact.html>.

2. Security Considerations

   Proper assignment and use of assigned numbers is critical to the
   security of numerous protocols.  The validity of the information
   from the IANA website is dependent on IANA's management of the site
   and the security of the protocols used to access it.

   The success of IANA and the name spaces being managed is due to the
   diligent work of the IANA staff and to the example set by IANA's
   late founder, Jon Postel[RFC2468].  Portions of text were taken from
   <http://www.iana.org/numbers.html>.
