1. Introduction

   The present document registers a media type for the OEBPS (Open eBook
   Publication Structure) Container Format (OCF).  An OCF file is a
   general-purpose container technology based on the ZIP archive format.
   It is used to encapsulate OEBPS publications and OPTIONAL alternate
   renditions thereof.  OCF and its related standards are maintained
   and defined by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF).

   The media type defined here is needed to correctly identify OCF files
   when they are edited on disk or used in other places where media types 
   are used.


2. Security Considerations

   OCF files contain binary data conforming to the ZIP file format.

   Clearly it is possible to author malicious files which, for
   example, contain malformed data. Most XML parsers protect
   themselves from such attacks by rigoriously enforcing conformance.
 
   All processors that read OPF files should rigourously check the
   size and validity of data retrieved.


3. IANA Considerations

   The present document requests that IANA registers the media type
   application/epub+zip as specified in Section 3.1. The registration 
   uses the template present in [RFC4288].


3.1. Media Type for OEBPS Container Format

   Type name:                         application

   Subtype name:                      epub+zip

   Required parameters:               none

   Optional parameters:               none

   Encoding considerations:           OCF files are binary file in ZIP
                                      format.

   Security considerations:           All processors that read OCF files
                                      should rigourously check the size 
                                      and validity of data retrieved.

   Interoperability considerations:   none
