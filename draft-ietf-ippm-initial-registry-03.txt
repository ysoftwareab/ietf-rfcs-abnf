1.  Introduction

   Note: Efforts to synchronize structure and terminology with
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] will likely be incomplete until both
   drafts are stable.

   This memo proposes an initial set of entries for the Performance
   Metric Registry.  It uses terms and definitions from the IPPM
   literature, primarily [RFC2330].  Proponents of Passive Performance
   Metrics are encouraged to develop a similar document.

   Although there are several standard templates for organizing
   specifications of performance metrics (see [RFC2679] for an example
   of the traditional IPPM template, based to large extent on the
   Benchmarking Methodology Working Group's traditional template in
   [RFC1242], and see [RFC6390] for a similar template), none of these
   templates were intended to become the basis for the columns of an

Internet-Draft              Initial Registry                  March 2017


   IETF-wide registry of metrics.  While examinating aspects of metric
   specifications which need to be registered, it became clear that none
   of the existing metric templates fully satisfies the particular needs
   of a registry.

   Therefore, [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] defines the overall format
   for a Performance Metric Registry.  Section 5 of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] also gives guidelines for those
   requesting registration of a Metric, that is the creation of entry(s)
   in the Performance Metric Registry: "In essence, there needs to be
   evidence that a candidate Registered Performance Metric has
   significant industry interest, or has seen deployment, and there is
   agreement that the candidate Registered Performance Metric serves its
   intended purpose."  The process in [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry]
   also requires that new entries are administered by IANA through
   Expert Review, which will ensure that the metrics are tightly
   defined.

2.  Scope

   This document defines the initial set of Performance Metrics Registry
   entries, for which IETF approval (following development in the IP
   Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group) will satisfy the
   requirement for Expert Review.  Note that all are Active Performance
   Metrics, which are based on RFCs prepared in the IPPM working group
   of the IETF, according to their framework [RFC2330] and its updates.

3.  Registry Categories and Columns

   This section provides the categories and columns of the registry, for
   easy reference.  An entry (row) therefore gives a complete
   description of a Registered Metric.

4.  UDP Round-trip Latency Registry Entry

   This section gives an initial registry entry for the UDP Round-trip
   Latency.

   Note: Each Registry entry only produces a "raw" output or a
   statistical summary.  To describe both "raw" and one or more
   statistics efficiently, the Identifier, Name, and Output Categories
   can be split and a single section can specify two or more closely-
   related metrics.  See Section 7 for an example specifying multiple
   Registry entries with many common columns.

4.1.  Summary

   This category includes multiple indexes to the registry entry: the
   element ID and metric name.

4.1.4.  Description

   This metric assesses the delay of a stream of packets exchanged
   between two hosts (which are the two measurement points), and the
   Output is the Round-trip delay for all successfully exchanged packets
   expressed as the 95th percentile of their conditional delay
   distribution.

   and values of input factors, called fixed parameters.

   <Full bibliographic reference to an immutable doc.>

   Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M.  Zekauskas, "A Round-trip Delay
   Metric for IPPM", RFC 2681, September 1999.

   [RFC2681]

   <specific section reference and additional clarifications, if needed>



Morton, et al.         Expires September 10, 2017               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              Initial Registry                  March 2017


   Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] provides the reference definition of the
   singleton (single value) Round-trip delay metric.  Section 3.4 of
   [RFC2681] provides the reference definition expanded to cover a
   multi-singleton sample.  Note that terms such as singleton and sample
   are defined in Section 11 of [RFC2330].

   Note that although the [RFC2681] definition of "Round-trip-Delay
   between Src and Dst" is directionally ambiguous in the text, this
   metric tightens the definition further to recognize that the host in
   the "Src" role will send the first packet to "Dst", and ultimately
   receive the corresponding return packet from "Dst" (when neither are
   lost).

   Finally, note that the variable "dT" is used in [RFC2681] to refer to
   the value of Round-trip delay in metric definitions and methods.  The
   variable "dT" has been re-used in other IPPM literature to refer to
   different quantities, and cannot be used as a global variable name.

         decimal64 with fraction digits = 5 (see section 9.3 of
         [RFC6020]) and with resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), with
         lossless conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per
         section 6 of [RFC5905].

4.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

4.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   The methodology for this metric is defined as Type-P-Round-trip-
   Delay-Poisson-Stream in section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] and section
   3.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] using the Type-P and Tmax defined under
   Fixed Parameters.

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and
   lost packets by implementing a maximum waiting time for packet
   arrival.  Tmax is the waiting time used as the threshold to declare a
   packet lost.  Lost packets SHALL be designated as having undefined
   delay.

   The calculations on the delay (RTT) SHALL be performed on the
   conditional distribution, conditioned on successful packet arrival
   within Tmax.  Also, when all packet delays are stored, the process
   which calculates the RTT value MAY enforce the Tmax threshold on
   stored values before calculations.  See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for
   details on the conditional distribution to exclude undefined values
   of delay, and Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background on this analysis
   choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between
   different packets in a stream to establish correspondence between
   sending times and receiving times for each successfully-arriving
   packet.  Sequence numbers or other send-order identification MUST be




Morton, et al.         Expires September 10, 2017              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft              Initial Registry                  March 2017


   retained at the Src or included with each packet to dis-ambiguate
   packet reordering if it occurs.

   If a standard measurement protocol is employed, then the measurement
   process will determine the sequence numbers or timestamps applied to
   test packets after the Fixed and Runtime parameters are passed to
   that process.  The chosen measurement protocol will dictate the
   format of sequence numbers and time-stamps, if they are conveyed in
   the packet payload.

   Refer to Section 4.4 of [RFC6673] for expanded discussion of the
   instruction to "send a Type-P packet back to the Src as quickly as
   possible" in Section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681].  Section 8 of
   [RFC6673] presents additional requirements which MUST be included in
   the method of measurement for this metric.

4.3.2.  Packet Stream Generation

   This section gives the details of the packet traffic which is the
   basis for measurement.  In IPPM metrics, this is called the Stream,
   and can easily be described by providing the list of stream
   parameters.

   <section/specification references, and description of any new
   generation parameters, if needed>

   Section 11.1.3 of [RFC2330] provides three methods to generate
   Poisson sampling intervals. the reciprocal of lambda is the average
   packet spacing, thus the Run-time Parameter is Reciprocal_lambda = 1/
   lambda, in seconds.

   >>> Check with Sam, most likely it is this...

   Method 3 SHALL be used, where given a start time (Run-time
   Parameter), the subsequent send times are all computed prior to
   measurement by computing the pseudo-random distribution of inter-
   packet send times, (truncating the distribution as specified in the
   Run-time Parameter, Trunc), and the Src sends each packet at the
   computed times.

   Note that Trunc is the upper limit on inter-packet times in the
   Poisson distribution.  A random value greater than Trunc is set equal
   to Trunc instead.

   Run-time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.

   <list of run-time parameters, and their data formats>

   Src  the IP address of the host in the Src Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see Section 4 of [RFC6991])

   Dst  the IP address of the host in the Dst Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see section 4 of [RFC6991])

   T0 a time, the start of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-
      time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3
      of [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a start time is unspecified
      and Tf is to be interpreted as the Duration of the measurement
      interval.  The start time is controlled through other means.

   Tf a time, the end of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time"
      as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a end time date is ignored and
      Tf is interpreted as the Duration of the measurement interval.

      32-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of [RFC5905] (values above
      this limit will be clipped and set to the limit value). (if fixed,
      Trunc = 30.0000 seconds.)

   >>> should Poisson run-time params be fixed instead? probably yes if

4.3.6.  Roles

   <lists the names of the different roles from the measurement method>

   Src  launches each packet and waits for return transmissions from
      Dst.

   Dst  waits for each packet from Src and sends a return packet to Src.

4.4.  Output

   This category specifies all details of the Output of measurements
   using the metric.

4.4.1.  Type

   <insert name of the output type, raw or a selected summary statistic>

   Percentile -- for the conditional distribution of all packets with a
   valid value of Round-trip delay (undefined delays are excluded), a
   single value corresponding to the 95th percentile, as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   The percentile = 95, meaning that the reported delay, "95Percentile",
   is the smallest value of Round-trip delay for which the Empirical
   Distribution Function (EDF), F(95Percentile) >= 95% of the singleton
   Round-trip delay values in the conditional distribution.  See section
   11.3 of [RFC2330] for the definition of the percentile statistic
   using the EDF.

   For all outputs ---

   T0 the start of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time" as
      specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].

   Tf the end of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time" as
      specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of

   Raw -- REMOVED IN VERSION 01

   For Act_IP_UDP_Round-trip_Delay_Poisson_95th-percentile:

   95Percentile  The time value of the result is expressed in units of
      seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction
      digits = 9 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of
      0.000000001 seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from
      the 64-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905]

4.4.3.  Metric Units

   <insert units for the measured results, and the reference
   specification>.

   The 95th Percentile of Round-trip Delay is expressed in seconds.

4.4.4.  Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the
   systematic and random errors of a time measurement.  In-situ
   calibration could be enabled with an internal loopback at the Source
   host that includes as much of the measurement system as possible,
   performs address manipulation as needed, and provides some form of
   isolation (e.g., deterministic delay) to avoid send-receive interface
   contention.  Some portion of the random and systematic error can be
   characterized this way.

   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the
   loopback is applied and the result is output in the same format as a
   normal measurement with additional indication that it is a
   calibration result.

Internet-Draft              Initial Registry                  March 2017


   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be
   used to estimate the *available accuracy* of the Output Metric Units.
   For example, repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal the
   portion of the Output result resolution which is the result of system
   noise, and thus inaccurate.

   Parameters.

5.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

5.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   See section 2.6 and 3.6 of [RFC3393] for general singleton element
   calculations.  This metric entry requires implementation of the PDV
   form defined in section 4.2 of [RFC5481].  Also see measurement
   considerations in section 8 of [RFC5481].

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and
   lost packets by implementing a maximum waiting time for packet
   arrival.  Tmax is the waiting time used as the threshold to declare a
   packet lost.  Lost packets SHALL be designated as having undefined
   delay.

   The calculations on the one-way delay SHALL be performed on the
   conditional distribution, conditioned on successful packet arrival
   within Tmax.  Also, when all packet delays are stored, the process
   which calculates the one-way delay value MAY enforce the Tmax
   threshold on stored values before calculations.  See section 4.1 of
   [RFC3393] for details on the conditional distribution to exclude
   undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background
   on this analysis choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between
   different packets in a stream to establish correspondence between
   sending times and receiving times for each successfully-arriving
   packet.  Sequence numbers or other send-order identification MUST be

   retained at the Src or included with each packet to dis-ambiguate
   packet reordering if it occurs.

   If a standard measurement protocol is employed, then the measurement
   process will determine the sequence numbers or timestamps applied to
   test packets after the Fixed and Runtime parameters are passed to
   that process.  The chosen measurement protocol will dictate the
   format of sequence numbers and time-stamps, if they are conveyed in
   the packet payload.

5.3.2.  Packet Stream Generation

   <list of generation parameters and section/spec references if needed>

   Section 11.1.3 of [RFC2330] provides three methods to generate
   Poisson sampling intervals. the reciprocal of lambda is the average
   packet spacing, thus the Run-time Parameter is Reciprocal_lambda = 1/
   lambda, in seconds.

   >>> Check with Sam, most likely it is this...

   Method 3 SHALL be used, where given a start time (Run-time
   Parameter), the subsequent send times are all computed prior to
   measurement by computing the pseudo-random distribution of inter-
   packet send times, (truncating the distribution as specified in the
   Parameter Trunc), and the Src sends each packet at the computed
   times.

   Note that Trunc is the upper limit on inter-packet times in the
   Poisson distribution.  A random value greater than Trunc is set equal
   to Trunc instead.

   Reciprocal_lambda  average packet interval for Poisson Streams
      expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of type
      decimal64 with fraction digits = 5 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020])
      with resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), and with lossless
      conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of
      [RFC5905].  Reciprocal_lambda = 1 packet per second.

   Trunc  Upper limit on Poisson distribution expressed in units of
      seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction
      digits = 5 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of
      0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), and with lossless conversion to/from the
      32-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of [RFC5905] (values above
      this limit will be clipped and set to the limit value).  Trunc =
      30.0000 seconds.

      time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3
      of [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a start time is unspecified
      and Tf is to be interpreted as the Duration of the measurement
      interval.  The start time is controlled through other means.

   Tf a time, the end of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time"
      as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a end time date is ignored and
      Tf is interpreted as the Duration of the measurement interval.

5.4.  Output

   <insert name of the output type, raw or a selected summary statistic>

   Percentile -- for the conditional distribution of all packets with a
   valid value of one-way delay (undefined delays are excluded), a
   single value corresponding to the 95th percentile, as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   The percentile = 95, meaning that the reported delay, "95Percentile",
   is the smallest value of one-way PDV for which the Empirical
   Distribution Function (EDF), F(95Percentile) >= 95% of the singleton
   one-way PDV values in the conditional distribution.  See section 11.3
   of [RFC2330] for the definition of the percentile statistic using the
   EDF.

5.4.2.  Reference Definition

   <the output type and data format for each type of result>

   T0 the start of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time" as
      specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].

   Tf the end of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time" as

      digits = 9 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of
      0.000000001 seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from

5.4.3.  Metric Units

   <insert units for the measured results, and the reference
   specification>.

   The 95th Percentile of one-way PDV is expressed in seconds.

5.4.4.  Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the
   systematic and random errors of a time measurement.  In-situ
   calibration could be enabled with an internal loopback that includes
   as much of the measurement system as possible, performs address
   manipulation as needed, and provides some form of isolation (e.g.,
   deterministic delay) to avoid send-receive interface contention.
   Some portion of the random and systematic error can be characterized
   this way.

   For one-way delay measurements, the error calibration must include an
   assessment of the internal clock synchronization with its external
   reference (this internal clock is supplying timestamps for
   measurement).  In practice, the time offsets of clocks at both the
   source and destination are needed to estimate the systematic error
   due to imperfect clock synchronization (the time offsets are
   smoothed, thus the random variation is not usually represented in the
   results).

   time_offset  The time value of the result is expressed in units of
      seconds, as a signed value of type decimal64 with fraction digits
      = 9 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.000000001
      seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit
      NTP timestamp as per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905]

   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the
   loopback is applied and the result is output in the same format as a
   normal measurement with additional indication that it is a
   calibration result.  In any measurement, the measurement function
   SHOULD report its current estimate of time offset as an indicator of
   the degree of synchronization.

   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be
   used to estimate the *available accuracy* of the Output Metric Units.
   For example, repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal the
   portion of the Output result resolution which is the result of system
   noise, and thus inaccurate.

   Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] provides the reference definition of the
   singleton (single value) Round-trip delay metric.  Section 3.4 of
   [RFC2681] provides the reference definition expanded to cover a
   multi-singleton sample.  Note that terms such as singleton and sample
   are defined in Section 11 of [RFC2330].

   For DNS Response Latency, the entities in [RFC1035] must be mapped to
   [RFC2681].  The Local Host with its User Program and Resolver take
   the role of "Src", and the Foreign Name Server takes the role of
   "Dst".

   Note that although the [RFC2681] definition of "Round-trip-Delay
   between Src and Dst at T" is directionally ambiguous in the text,
   this metric tightens the definition further to recognize that the
   host in the "Src" role will send the first packet to "Dst", and
   ultimately receive the corresponding return packet from "Dst" (when
   neither are lost).

   Observation: reply packets will contain a DNS response and may

6.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

6.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   The methodology for this metric is defined as Type-P-Round-trip-
   Delay-Poisson-Stream in section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] and section
   3.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] using the Type-P and Timeout defined under
   Fixed Parameters.

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and
   lost packets by implementing a maximum waiting time for packet
   arrival.  Tmax is the waiting time used as the threshold to declare a
   packet lost.  Lost packets SHALL be designated as having undefined
   delay.

   The calculations on the delay (RTT) SHALL be performed on the
   conditional distribution, conditioned on successful packet arrival
   within Tmax.  Also, when all packet delays are stored, the process
   which calculates the RTT value MAY enforce the Tmax threshold on
   stored values before calculations.  See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for
   details on the conditional distribution to exclude undefined values
   of delay, and Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background on this analysis
   choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between
   different packets in a stream to establish correspondence between
   sending times and receiving times for each successfully-arriving
   reply.  Therefore, sequence numbers or other send-order
   identification MUST be retained at the Src or included with each
   packet to dis-ambiguate packet reordering if it occurs.  Sequence
   number is part of the payload described under Fixed Parameters.

   DNS Messages bearing Queries provide for random ID Numbers in the
   Identification header field, so more than one query may be launched
   while a previous request is outstanding when the ID Number is used.

   IF a DNS response does not arrive within Tmax, the result is
   undefined.  The Message ID SHALL be used to disambiguate the
   successive queries.

   >>> This would require support of ID generation and population in the
   Message.  An alternative would be to use a random Source port on the
   Query Message, but we would choose ONE before proceding.

   Refer to Section 4.4 of [RFC6673] for expanded discussion of the
   instruction to "send a Type-P packet back to the Src as quickly as
   possible" in Section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681].  Section 8 of
   [RFC6673] presents additional requirements which shall be included in
   the method of measurement for this metric.

   In addition to operations described in [RFC2681], the Src MUST parse
   the DNS headers of the reply and prepare the information for
   subsequent reporting as a measured result, along with the Round-Trip
   Delay.

6.3.2.  Packet Stream Generation

   This section gives the details of the packet traffic which is the
   basis for measurement.  In IPPM metrics, this is called the Stream,
   and can easily be dscribed by providing the list of stream
   parameters.

   <list of generation parameters and section/spec references if needed>

   Section 11.1.3 of RFC 2681 [RFC2330] provides three methods to
   generate Poisson sampling intervals.  The reciprocal of lambda is the
   average packet rate, thus the Run-time Parameter is Reciprocal_lambda
   = 1/lambda, in seconds.

   Method 3 is used, where given a start time (Run-time Parameter), the
   subsequent send times are all computed prior to measurement by
   computing the pseudo-random distribution of inter-packet send times,
   (truncating the distribution as specified in the Run-time
   Parameters), and the Src sends each packet at the computed times.

   Note that Trunc is the upper limit on inter-packet times in the
   Poisson distribution.  A random value greater than Trunc is set equal
   to Trunc instead.

   ID The 16-bit identifier assigned by the program that generates the
      query, and which must vary in successive queries, see
      Section 4.1.1 of [RFC1035].  This identifier is copied into the

6.4.2.  Reference Definition

   <describe the data format for each type of result>

   For all outputs:

   T  the time the DNS Query was sent during the measurement interval,
      (format "date-and-time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339],
      see also Section 3 of [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required
      by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330].

   dT The time value of the round-trip delay to receive the DNS
      response, expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of
      type decimal64 with fraction digits = 9 (see section 9.3 of
      [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.000000001 seconds (1.0 ns), and
      with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit NTP timestamp as per
      section 6 of RFC [RFC5905].  This value is undefined when the
      response packet is not received at Src within waiting time Tmxax
      seconds.

   Rcode  The value of the Rcode field in the DNS response header,
      expressed as a uint64 as specified in section 9.2 of [RFC6020].
      Non-zero values convey errors in the response, and such replies
      must be analyzed separately from successful requests.

6.4.3.  Metric Units

   <insert units for the measured results, and the reference
   specification>.

   Round-trip Delay, dT, is expressed in seconds.

6.4.4.  Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the
   systematic and random errors of a time measurement.  In-situ
   calibration could be enabled with an internal loopback at the Source
   host that includes as much of the measurement system as possible,
   performs address and payload manipulation as needed, and provides
   some form of isolation (e.g., deterministic delay) to avoid send-
   receive interface contention.  Some portion of the random and
   systematic error can be characterized this way.

   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the
   loopback is applied and the result is output in the same format as a
   normal measurement with additional indication that it is a
   calibration result.

   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be
   used to estimate the *available accuracy* of the Output Metric Units.
   For example, repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal the
   portion of the Output result resolution which is the result of system
   noise, and thus inaccurate.

7.  UDP Poisson One-way Delay Registry Entries

   This section specifies five initial registry entries for the UDP
   Poisson One-way Delay.

   Note: Each Registry "Name" below specifies a single registry entry,
   whose output format varies according to the <statistic> element of
   the name that specifies one form of statistical summary.

   IANA is asked to assign a different numeric identifiers to each of
   the five Metrics.  All column entries beside the ID, Name,
   Description, and Output Reference Method categories are the same,
   thus this section proposes five closely-related registry entries.  As
   a result, IANA is also asked to assign corresponding URNs and URLs to
   each Named Metric.

      to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of [RFC5905].

   See the Packet Stream generation category for two additional Fixed
   Parameters.

7.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

7.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>




Morton, et al.         Expires September 10, 2017              [Page 36]

Internet-Draft              Initial Registry                  March 2017


   The methodology for this metric is defined as Type-P-One-way-Delay-
   Poisson-Stream in section 3.6 of [RFC7679] and section 4.6 of
   [RFC7679] using the Type-P and Tmax defined under Fixed Parameters.

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and
   lost packets by implementing a maximum waiting time for packet
   arrival.  Tmax is the waiting time used as the threshold to declare a
   packet lost.  Lost packets SHALL be designated as having undefined
   delay.

   The calculations on the one-way delay SHALL be performed on the
   conditional distribution, conditioned on successful packet arrival
   within Tmax.  Also, when all packet delays are stored, the process
   which calculates the one-way delay value MAY enforce the Tmax
   threshold on stored values before calculations.  See section 4.1 of
   [RFC3393] for details on the conditional distribution to exclude
   undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background
   on this analysis choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between
   different packets in a stream to establish correspondence between
   sending times and receiving times for each successfully-arriving
   packet.  Sequence numbers or other send-order identification MUST be
   retained at the Src or included with each packet to dis-ambiguate
   packet reordering if it occurs.

   Since a standard measurement protocol is employed [RFC5357], then the
   measurement process will determine the sequence numbers or timestamps
   applied to test packets after the Fixed and Runtime parameters are
   passed to that process.  The measurement protocol dictates the format
   of sequence numbers and time-stamps conveyed in the TWAMP-Test packet
   payload.

7.3.2.  Packet Stream Generation

   This section gives the details of the packet traffic which is the
   basis for measurement.  In IPPM metrics, this is called the Stream,
   and can easily be dscribed by providing the list of stream
   parameters.

   <list of generation parameters and section/spec references if needed>

   Section 11.1.3 of RFC 2681 [RFC2330] provides three methods to
   generate Poisson sampling intervals. the reciprocal of lambda is the
   average packet spacing, thus the Run-time Parameter is
   Reciprocal_lambda = 1/lambda, in seconds.

   Method 3 SHALL be used, where given a start time (Run-time
   Parameter), the subsequent send times are all computed prior to
   measurement by computing the pseudo-random distribution of inter-
   packet send times, (truncating the distribution as specified in the
   Parameter Trunc), and the Src sends each packet at the computed
   times.

   Note that Trunc is the upper limit on inter-packet times in the
   Poisson distribution.  A random value greater than Trunc is set equal
   to Trunc instead.

   Reciprocal_lambda  average packet interval for Poisson Streams
      expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of type
      decimal64 with fraction digits = 5 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020])
      with resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), and with lossless
      conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of
      [RFC5905].  Reciprocal_lambda = 1 packet per second.

   Trunc  Upper limit on Poisson distribution expressed in units of
      seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction
      digits = 5 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of
      0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), and with lossless conversion to/from the
      32-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of [RFC5905] (values above
      this limit will be clipped and set to the limit value).  Trunc =
      30.0000 seconds.

   For each <statistic>, one of the following sub-sections apply:

7.4.2.1.  Percentile95

   The 95th percentile SHALL be calculated using the conditional
   distribution of all packets with a finite value of One-way delay
   (undefined delays are excluded), a single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   See section 4.3 of [RFC3393] for details on the percentile statistic
   (where Round-trip delay should be substituted for "ipdv").

   The percentile = 95, meaning that the reported delay, "95Percentile",
   is the smallest value of one-way delay for which the Empirical
   Distribution Function (EDF), F(95Percentile) >= 95% of the singleton
   one-way delay values in the conditional distribution.  See section
   11.3 of [RFC2330] for the definition of the percentile statistic
   using the EDF.

   95Percentile  The time value of the result is expressed in units of
      seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction
      digits = 9 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of
      0.000000001 seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from
      the 64-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905]

7.4.2.2.  Mean

7.4.2.4.  Max

   The maximum SHALL be calculated using the conditional distribution of
   all packets with a finite value of One-way delay (undefined delays
   are excluded), a single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of

   See section 4.3.2 of [RFC6049] for a closely related method for
   calculating this statistic, and 4.3.3 of [RFC6049].  The formula is
   as follows:

            Max = (FiniteDelay [j])

                  such that for some index, j, where 1 <= j <= N
                  FiniteDelay[j] >= FiniteDelay[n] for all n

7.4.2.5.  Std_Dev

   The Std_Dev SHALL be calculated using the conditional distribution of
   all packets with a finite value of One-way delay (undefined delays
   are excluded), a single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   See section 4.3.2 of [RFC6049] for a closely related method for
   calculating this statistic, and 4.3.3 of [RFC6049].  The formula is
   the classic calculation for standard deviation of a population.

   Std_Dev  The time value of the result is expressed in units of
      seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction
      digits = 9 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of
      0.000000001 seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from
      the 64-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905]

7.4.3.  Metric Units

   <insert units for the measured results, and the reference
   specification>.

   The <statistic> of One-way Delay is expressed in seconds.

7.4.4.  Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the
   systematic and random errors of a time measurement.  In-situ
   calibration could be enabled with an internal loopback that includes
   as much of the measurement system as possible, performs address
   manipulation as needed, and provides some form of isolation (e.g.,
   deterministic delay) to avoid send-receive interface contention.
   Some portion of the random and systematic error can be characterized
   this way.

   For one-way delay measurements, the error calibration must include an
   assessment of the internal clock synchronization with its external
   reference (this internal clock is supplying timestamps for
   measurement).  In practice, the time offsets of clocks at both the
   source and destination are needed to estimate the systematic error
   due to imperfect clock synchronization (the time offsets are
   smoothed, thus the random variation is not usually represented in the
   results).

   time_offset  The time value of the result is expressed in units of
      seconds, as a signed value of type decimal64 with fraction digits
      = 9 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.000000001
      seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit
      NTP timestamp as per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905]

   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the
   loopback is applied and the result is output in the same format as a
   normal measurement with additional indication that it is a
   calibration result.  In any measurement, the measurement function
   SHOULD report its current estimate of time offset as an indicator of
   the degree of synchronization.

   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be
   used to estimate the *available accuracy* of the Output Metric Units.
   For example, repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal the
   portion of the Output result resolution which is the result of system
   noise, and thus inaccurate.

   Note: Each Registry "Name" below specifies a single registry entry,
   whose output format varies according to the <statistic> element of
   the name that specifies one form of statistical summary.

   IANA is asked to assign a different numeric identifiers to each of
   the five Metrics.  All column entries beside the ID, Name,
   Description, and Output Reference Method categories are the same,
   thus this section proposes five closely-related registry entries.  As
   a result, IANA is also asked to assign corresponding URNs and URLs to
   each Named Metric.

   Parameters.

8.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

8.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   The methodology for this metric is defined as Type-P-One-way-Delay-
   Poisson-Stream in section 3.6 of [RFC7679] and section 4.6 of
   [RFC7679] using the Type-P and Tmax defined under Fixed Parameters.

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and
   lost packets by implementing a maximum waiting time for packet
   arrival.  Tmax is the waiting time used as the threshold to declare a
   packet lost.  Lost packets SHALL be designated as having undefined
   delay.

   The calculations on the one-way delay SHALL be performed on the
   conditional distribution, conditioned on successful packet arrival
   within Tmax.  Also, when all packet delays are stored, the process
   which calculates the one-way delay value MAY enforce the Tmax
   threshold on stored values before calculations.  See section 4.1 of
   [RFC3393] for details on the conditional distribution to exclude
   undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background
   on this analysis choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between
   different packets in a stream to establish correspondence between
   sending times and receiving times for each successfully-arriving
   packet.  Sequence numbers or other send-order identification MUST be
   retained at the Src or included with each packet to dis-ambiguate
   packet reordering if it occurs.

   Since a standard measurement protocol is employed [RFC5357], then the
   measurement process will determine the sequence numbers or timestamps
   applied to test packets after the Fixed and Runtime parameters are
   passed to that process.  The measurement protocol dictates the format
   of sequence numbers and time-stamps conveyed in the TWAMP-Test packet
   payload.

8.3.2.  Packet Stream Generation

   <list of generation parameters and section/spec references if needed>

   This section gives the details of the packet traffic which is the
   basis for measurement.  In IPPM metrics, this is called the Stream,
   and can easily be described by providing the list of stream
   parameters.

   Section 3 of [RFC3432] prescribes the method for generating Periodic
   streams using associated parameters.

   incT  the nominal duration of inter-packet interval, first bit to
      first bit

   dT the duration of the interval for allowed sample start times

   T0 the actual start time of the periodic stream

   NOTE: an initiation process with a number of control exchanges
   resulting in unpredictable start times (within a time interval) may
   be sufficient to avoid synchronization of periodic streams, and
   therefore a valid replacement for selecting a start time at random
   from a fixed interval.

   These stream parameters will be specified as Run-time parameters.

8.3.5.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.

   <list of run-time parameters, and their data formats>

   Src  the IP address of the host in the Src Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see Section 4 of [RFC6991])

   Dst  the IP address of the host in the Dst Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see section 4 of [RFC6991])

   T0 a time, the start of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-
      time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3
      of [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a start time is unspecified
      and Tf is to be interpreted as the Duration of the measurement
      interval.  The start time is controlled through other means.

   Tf a time, the end of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time"
      as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a end time date is ignored and
      Tf is interpreted as the Duration of the measurement interval.

   >>> should Periodic run-time params be fixed instead? probably yes if
   modeling a specific version of tests.  Note in the NAME, i.e.
   Poisson3.3

8.3.6.  Roles

   <lists the names of the different roles from the measurement method>

   Src  launches each packet and waits for return transmissions from
      Dst. This is the TWAMP Session-Sender.

   Dst  waits for each packet from Src and sends a return packet to Src.
      This is the TWAMP Session-Reflector.

8.4.2.1.  Percentile95

   The 95th percentile SHALL be calculated using the conditional

   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   See section 4.3 of [RFC3393] for details on the percentile statistic
   (where Round-trip delay should be substituted for "ipdv").

   The percentile = 95, meaning that the reported delay, "95Percentile",
   is the smallest value of one-way delay for which the Empirical
   Distribution Function (EDF), F(95Percentile) >= 95% of the singleton
   one-way delay values in the conditional distribution.  See section
   11.3 of [RFC2330] for the definition of the percentile statistic
   using the EDF.

10.1.9.  Reference Specification(s)

   [RFC3611][RFC4566][RFC6776][RFC6792][RFC7003]

10.2.  Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary
   details related to the metric definition, including the RFC reference
   and values of input factors, called fixed parameters.  Section 3.2 of
   [RFC7003] provides the reference information for this category.

10.2.1.  Reference Definition

   Packets Discarded in Bursts:

   The total number of packets discarded during discard bursts.  The
   measured value is unsigned value.  If the measured value exceeds
   0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an over-
   range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable, the value
   0xFFFFFF MUST be reported.

10.2.2.  Fixed Parameters

   Fixed Parameters are input factors that must be determined and
   embedded in the measurement system for use when needed.  The values
   of these parameters is specified in the Registry.

   Threshold: 8 bits, set to value = 3 packets.

   The Threshold is equivalent to Gmin in [RFC3611], i.e., the number of
   successive packets that must not be discarded prior to and following
   a discard packet in order for this discarded packet to be regarded as
   part of a gap.  Note that the Threshold is set in accordance with the
   Gmin calculation defined in Section 4.7.2 of [RFC3611].

   Interval Metric flag: 2 bits, set to value 11=Cumulative Duration

   This field is used to indicate whether the burst/gap discard metrics
   are Sampled, Interval, or Cumulative metrics [RFC6792]:

   I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the most
   recent measurement interval duration between successive metrics
   reports.

   I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
   accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.

   Senders MUST NOT use the values I=00 or I=01.

10.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.  For the Burst/Gap Discard
   Metric, it appears that the only guidance on methods of measurement
   is in Section 3.0 of [RFC7003] and its supporting references.
   Relevant information is repeated below, although there appears to be
   no section titled "Method of Measurement" in [RFC7003].

10.3.1.  Reference Method

   Metrics in this block report on burst/gap discard in the stream
   arriving at the RTP system.  Measurements of these metrics are made
   at the receiving end of the RTP stream.  Instances of this metrics
   block use the synchronization source (SSRC) to refer to the separate
   auxiliary Measurement Information Block [RFC6776], which describes
   measurement periods in use (see [RFC6776], Section 4.2).

   This metrics block relies on the measurement period in the
   Measurement Information Block indicating the span of the report.
   Senders MUST send this block in the same compound RTCP packet as the
   Measurement Information Block.  Receivers MUST verify that the
   measurement period is received in the same compound RTCP packet as
   this metrics block.  If not, this metrics block MUST be discarded.

10.3.2.  Stream Type and Stream Parameters

   Since RTCP-XR Measurements are conducted on live RTP traffic, the
   complete description of the stream is contained in SDP messages that
   proceed the establishment of a compatible stream between two or more
   communicating hosts.  See Run-time Parameters, below.

10.3.3.  Output Type and Data Format

   The output type defines the type of result that the metric produces.

   o  Value: Packets Discarded in Bursts

   o  Data Format: 24 bits

   o  Reference: Section 3.2 of [RFC7003]

10.3.4.  Metric Units

   The measured results are apparently expressed in packets, although
   there is no section of [RFC7003] titled "Metric Units".

10.3.5.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-Time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.  However, the values of these
   parameters is not specified in the Registry, rather these parameters
   are listed as an aid to the measurement system implementor or user
   (they must be left as variables, and supplied on execution).

   The Data Format of each Run-time Parameter SHALL be specified in this
   column, to simplify the control and implementation of measurement
   devices.

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].

   SDP Parameters: As defined in [RFC4566]

   Session description v= (protocol version number, currently only 0)

   o= (originator and session identifier : username, id, version number,
   network address)

   s= (session name : mandatory with at least one UTF-8-encoded

   measurement has been removed. * Explanation of Conditional delay
   distribution.

   Version 03 addressed Phil Eardley's comments and suggestions in
   sections 1-4. and resolved the definition of Percentiles.

   Version 04 * All section 4 parameters reference YANG types for
   alternate data formats. * Discussion has concluded that usecase(s)
   for machine parse-able registry columns are not needed.

12.  Security Considerations

   These registry entries represent no known security implications for
   Internet Security.  Each referenced Metric contains a Security
   Considerations section.

13.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to populate The Performance Metric Registry defined
   in [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] with the values defined above.

   See the IANA Considerations section of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] for additional requests and
   considerations.

14.  Acknowledgements

   The authors thank Brian Trammell for suggesting the term "Run-time
   Parameters", which led to the distinction between run-time and fixed
   parameters implemented in this memo, for identifying the IPFIX metric
   with Flow Key as an example, and for many other productive
   suggestions.  Thanks to Peter Koch, who provided several useful
   suggestions for disambiguating successive DNS Queries in the DNS
   Response time metric.

   The authors also acknowledge the constructive reviews and helpful
   suggestions from Barbara Stark, Juergen Schoenwaelder, Tim Carey, and
   participants in the LMAP working group.  Thanks to Michelle Cotton
   for her early IANA review, and to Amanda Barber for answering
   questions related to the presentation of the registry and
   accessibility of the complete template via URL.
