  1.     Introduction 
   
  Global mobility management solutions have been under design by the 
  IETF for the past fifteen years or so (assuming the creation of 
  the Mobile IP Working Group as a start). The basic goal pursued at 
  the time of starting that effort, was the ability to continue an 
  IP session when a host IP address had to change. The targeted IP 
  sessions were those involving a transport level connection. 
   
  No other motivation but to achieve session continuity has really 
  been taken into account so far in defining the existing solutions 
  for global mobility management. Effectively, the main goal has 
  always been to hide the IP address change from the transport level 
  as well as from the correspondent node perspective. In such a way, 
  a host would keep sending packets and continue to be reachable 
  while moving. 
   
  Therefore, from a network standpoint, having a mobility anchor 
  node perform the route update or notify its correspondents that 
  the moving host care-of address had changed was sufficient enough 
  to achieve the precedent goal. Solutions as Mobile IP or HIP 
  operate on that pattern. 
   
  Actually, global mobility management architectures and protocols 
  from the IETF have grown in more or less a parallel to those

Internet-Draft             problem statement              February 2006 
                                     
                                     
  designed in other SDOs as 3GPP where other considerations were 
  taken into account aside that of just continuing the IP session of 
  a user. Indeed 3GPP would be motivated by other considerations as 
  for example the need for the provider to control the selection of 
  the target access network of attachment. 
  And still, future global mobility systems will tend to marry 
  existing mechanisms from different standardization actors (IETF, 
  3GPP, IEEE802…) built with different purposes and motivations. 
  This tendency will grow even wider as services will move to be 
  all-IP based and access agnostic. With that thinking, there is a 
  growing feeling that the match between the mechanisms built in 
  these different SDOs is far from optimal and suitable. This is 
  especially true when considering some market oriented requirements 
  as can have mobile operators owning several types of access 
  networks that they want to make inter-work to provide their users 
  with global mobility. 
   
  Indeed the fact that an IP handover should be seamless is not the 
  only motivation when solving the global mobility problem solving. 
  What appears as a simple movement actually involves a lot of 
  external factors. While ensuring seamless continuity for the user, 
  other objectives are to be fulfilled. For integrated access system 
  operators, such objectives can be as numerous as the needs to: 
   
     . Judiciously using the "newly" available radio capacity 
       (Wifi, Wimax…) to unblock cellular systems and provide 
       multimedia services; 
     . Guaranteeing service level for the users by helping them 
       determine the best system for the service they get to access 
       to; 
     . Optimizing the use of the radio resources (especially on 
       cellular), so as to dedicate the radio spectrum to serving 
       more data/voice by lowering the signaling overhead; 
     . Making  integrated  (and  therefore  already  composite) 
       architectures less complex, as well as minimizing protocols 
       to render overall systems more scalable; 
     . Lowering requirements and constraints on hosts for a 
       straightforward support of inter-system mobility. 
   
  The two first and last bullets points basically require that the 
  global mobility management system be network controlled oriented 
  as opposed to terminal controlled. Also given such requirements, 
  global mobility management solutions as they exist today seem to 
  hardly meet the previously indicated market needs.  
   
   
2.   Terminology 
   
  Terminology is an aspect of mobility management that is in 
  constant change, because of often evolving requirements. The terms 
  "aggregate router", "care-of-address", "IP location update",

Internet-Draft             problem statement              February 2006 
                                     
                                     
  "mobility  management",  "global mobility  management",  "local 
  mobility management" "mobility anchor" will be given the 
  interpretation precised below. These interpretations are meant 
  consensual enough not to confuse the reader. 
   
   
  Aggregate router 
   
  This is a specific router in an access network acting as its 
  border router on the core network side. 
   
  Care-of-address 
   
  In this document, a care-of-address refers to an IP address 
  temporarily acquired by a mobile host while visiting an IP access 
  network, irrespective of which global mobility management protocol 
  the host is running. Therefore, a host may have a care-of-address 
  without running MIP. Coming revisions of this document might 
  suggest an alternative expression to avoid ambiguity. 
   
   
  IP location update 
   
  This is a generic procedure whereby a host informs a mobility 
  anchor in the network or a correspondent located anywhere on the 
  internet that it has a new active care-of-address and therefore a 
  new IP location. This procedure is called registration in Mobile 
  IPv4 and re-association in HIP. 
   
   
  Mobility management 
   
  RFC 3753 defines local and global mobility management but the 
   notion of mobility management itself is not defined. For the 
   purposes of this document, mobility management will be defined as 
   the process of performing and sequencing the following actions; 
     . Collect information from terminal, Radio Access Points and 
       Resource Controllers to assess the need or opportunity for a 
       handover 
     . Choose a handover target, as a result of deciding the next 
       Radio Access Network and Point of attachment based on 
       collected information, QoS needs and other policies. 
     . Execute the handover on the terminal. This generally 
       consists in switching between radio links, preparing the IP 
       configuration over the new link and performing the IP 
       location update. 
   This definition does not make any assumption of which side between 
   the network and the terminal decides of the handoff target.  
    
    
   Global mobility management

Internet-Draft             problem statement              February 2006 
                                     
                                     
    
   Mobility management is said to be global whenever it involves a 
   mobile host that is moving between IP domains that are 
   "topologically distant". IP Domains are considered topologically 
   distant when their respective aggregate routers are located 
   multiple hops away from one another. Heterogeneous access networks 
   would usually constitutes such IP domains. These domains can be 
   part of the same administrative boundaries, eg an operator 
   integrating several access networks providers. 
    
    
   Network global mobility management 
    
   A global mobility management procedure controlled by the network 
    
    
   Local mobility management 
    
   Mobility management is said to be local whenever it involves a 
   mobile host moving between IP domains that are topologically 
   close. Such domains would usually be confined into a single access 
   network. 
    
    
   Mobility anchor 
   
  A mobility anchor is an IP node that either: 
     . Performs the forwarding and path update of IP packets 
       destined to the moving host 
     . notifies correspondents that the moving host care-of address 
       has changed 
   With this definition, a mobility anchor only participates to the 
   goal of making the moving host reachable. The Home Agent of MIP 
   and the Rendez-Server of HIP are example of defined mobility 
   anchors. However the mobility anchor described in the deployment 
   scenario of this document will not refer to these specific nodes. 
    
    
   Inter-System Mobility Server 
    
   This is a node typically located in an integrated operator network 
   and that help deciding of the mobile host target system (step 2 of 
   mobility management) based on several criteria. Such a node is 
   used in this document to illustrate the network global mobility 
   management problem. Considerations associated with selection 
   criteria are clearly out of scope.

4.   Deployment scenarios considered 
    
   As said, global mobility refers to the "movement" performed by a 
   host as it changes its point of attachment from an access network 
   to another one topologically distant. Typically, such movement 
   will either occur between two access networks of different 
   providers or also between two access networks owned by the same 
   service provider. The problem raised in this document addresses 
   the later category of movement. 
    
    
  4.1.       Movement between different access network providers 
    
   The following figure depicts a deployment model where a host is 
   moving between two access networks operated by different 
   providers. Such providers will usually not cooperate for the 
   purpose of mobility management as defined earlier.

  Figure 1: example Deployment scenario for two access networks 
   owned by different providers 
    
    
   The terminal is in this case (as the only node capable of getting 
   access networks information), in good position to perform the 
   mobility management functions on its own. Global mobility 
   management solutions as they are specified today (i.e basically 
   host based) well apply to this deployment model. Indeed with such 
   a scenario, seamless global mobility requirements as prescribed 
   earlier can not be met in practice, because access networks from 
   different providers would usually not cooperate for mobility 
   management. 
    
    
  4.2.       Movement within an integrated access network provider 
    
    
   The following figure depicts a classical deployment scenario for 
   an operator that is owner of several access networks that it wants 
   to make cooperate because of the need to ensure the goals and 
   requirements as listed in the introduction.

       Figure 2: Deployment scenario for an integrated operator 
    
    
   In such an integrated operator scenario, the network is in good 
   position to perform mobility management. It specifically is able 
   to watch over the capacity of every system. A function therein 
   (represented here with an Inter-System Mobility Server) would 
   basically keep the terminal "inter-system" state. Specifications 
   as the 802.21 draft would see the MIH Point of Service into such a 
   server. Note that such a function can be co-located to the node 
   acting as the IP Mobility anchor. However these considerations are 
   informative only and out of scope here. 
   The IP mobility anchor here would be only dedicated at performing 
   the routing update consequently to changing active IP connectivity 
   of the host from one access system to another.

Internet-Draft             problem statement              February 2006 
                                     
                                     
   When a core network is able to federate the access systems, and 
   with the use of appropriate information exchange protocols and 
   mechanisms within network nodes, an entity as the precedent Inter-
   System Mobility Server can also be in favorable position to have 
   the knowledge that a specific host it is serving is using a 
   specific care-of-address (without requiring explicit notice from 
   that host). 
    
   Effectively address assignment schemes for a provider deployment 
   are likely to be dynamic based. So that the intelligence that a 
   moving host visiting a specific access network is holding a 
   specific care-of-address is already available somewhere in the 
   network and therefore could be easily made available to a mobility 
   anchor serving the host. 
   On the event of a handover, to another access network of the 
   integrated  provider,  the  target  IP  configuration  of  the 
   host(including the care-of-address to use) can be prepared in the 
   network (especially when dynamically assigned) and made available 
   to the mobility anchor. This will in turn be able to forward 
   future packets to the new host location upon the host receiving 
   such configuration. 
    
   Therefore, the explicit IP location update as well as the 
   necessity to keep association states between host and mobility 
   anchor of existing global mobility solutions (Registration and REA 
   procedures of MIP or HIP) can be avoided in this model. The next 
   paragraph precisely describes the problem encountered when 
   resorting to such an explicit IP location update and association 
   with IP mobility anchor.  
    
   It is to be made explicitly clear that any specific procedure by 
   which the network can be aware of the terminal new and old IP 
   configuration is not mandated. Every implementation of the 
   deployment model can figure out how they want to get the 
   information.  
    
    
5.   Issues and problems with Existing global mobility management 
   (gmm)solutions 
    
   This paragraph captures the reasons why classical gmm solutions 
   are problematic in regards to driving requirements as presented in 
   the introduction. 
    
  5.1.       Signaling ratio over the radio 
    
   Global mobility management solutions known to date do not 
   guarantee an efficient use of the radio capacity, especially with 
   the need to associate to a mobility anchor and perform frequent 
   explicit IP location updates from hosts.

Internet-Draft             problem statement              February 2006 
                                     
                                     
   Terminals are required to support more and more control planes. A 
   single terminal could have to support, multiple radios, as well as 
   authentication, inter-system mobility, IMS… that all generate fair 
   amount of signaling 
    
   Aside IP session continuity, integrated mobility architecture will 
   also have to address such transitions as VoIP to circuit switched 
   voice. So will multi-systems terminals. This new type of session 
   continuity requires specific mobility anchors that are different 
   from entities as Home Agents (that can only perform the switch 
   between two IP legs). Therefore, it is a strong requirement that 
   signaling overhead from hosts to these different mobility anchors 
   do not grow as their number or type will multiply. 
    
    
  5.2.       Complexity of global mobility management procedures and of 
  hosts 
    
   As said in the introduction, simplifying architectures that 
   already have composite systems, as well as minimizing the 
   protocols is a requirement on the road to rendering next 
   generation mobility architectures more scalable. Also lowering 
   software support requirements on hosts would facilitate early 
   adoption of seamless mobility by reducing the time to market for 
   terminals to be seamless mobility compatible. 
    
   Complete global mobility management procedures would basically 
   require that a mechanism exist to perform the procedures as 
   described in paragraph 2, basically collecting information to 
   prepare a handover, and indicate the target to the terminal. Known 
   solutions for gmm do not provide these steps. Therefore they 
   usually superpose to the previous steps to create complex state 
   machines and heavy message exchange flows between hosts and the 
   network.  
   Also, usually a terminal will already have mobility management 
   states for every activated link (UMTS, Wimax…). To that, has to 
   superpose the state of association to the mobility anchor of 
   classical global mobility management protocol. Such an association 
   (needed because of the host has to explicitly send its IP location 
   to the network) adds sensitiveness to the overall stability.  
    
   Lowering hosts complexity is already a requirement of netlmm. 
   Another example is about the VoIP to Circuit Switched transition 
   work carried out in 3GPP is being addressed with no specific 
   needed support on the host but native IMS. 
    
    
  5.3.       Guarantee of service level, other stringent requirements on 
  terminals

Internet-Draft             problem statement              February 2006 
                                     
                                     
   An integrated deployment model as presented in 3.2 has the ability 
   to facilitate network control. Network control brings guarantee of 
   service level to moving users as well as assurance that the 
   capacity of provider spread across systems is used efficiently. 
   Network control implies that the initiation of the IP location 
   update procedure is governed by rules indicated by the network. 
   Therefore, a specific requirement is to be observed by the 
   existing global mobility protocol stack to perform the IP location 
   update only upon indication from the network to switch between 
   links. 
    
   Furthermore, as these gmm solutions let it totally implementation 
   dependant the set of events that trigger the IP location update 
   procedure, it is practically impossible for all implementations to 
   have the same state machine for triggering that IP location change 
   notice. 
   Therefore, implementations as would be wanted for network control 
   will have to be featured in a way to perform the IP location 
   procedure only after a network indication to do so. Flexibility of 
   standard implementation is often desired but can be become 
   cumbersome in some cases. 
   Many operators are building roadmaps for deploying seamless 
   mobility for IP services with previously indicated requirements. 
   Because of the previously identified problem of gmm solutions to 
   date, such operators have to make specific requests for quotations 
   to smart devices vendors to design implementations that fit their 
   purposes of network control. This burden becomes considerable when 
   deployment is considered at a large scale.  
    
    
  5.4.       Mobility between two netlmm compatible domains owned by a same 
  operator 
    
   An alternative deployment scenario for an integrated provider 
   willing to offer global mobility would via the aggregation of 
   several netlmm operated access networks into a core network.

      Figure 3: Mobility between operator's aggregated Netlmm 
   domains 
    
    
   As in the scenario of figure 2, the fact that both netlmm domains 
   belong to the same administration, make it possible the exchange 
   of information for mobility management within the network.  
   Even in the case where the same localized mobility management 
   protocol is used in both access domains, a classical global 
   mobility protocol will have to be resorted to for the inter-domain 
   transition. 
    
   For architecture scalability and host simplicity, it would not be 
   desirable to multiply such mobility protocols. Instead Netlmm 
   solutions would certainly better be commoditized for integrated 
   architectures and global mobility, so that the hosts and the 
   network do not require any additional mobility management protocol 
   to achieve the inter-domain movement. However, it is not clear at 
   this point whether generalizing netlmm to the global problem would 
   be the right approach. Also, SDOs as 3GPP are working on evolved 
   architectures that require global IP mobility protocols. Solutions

Internet-Draft             problem statement              February 2006 
                                     
                                     
   meeting requirements presented in this document would be 
   particularly adapted to these new architectures. Available gmm 
   solutions may still work for these evolutions, but at the cost of 
   the burden presented earlier. 
    
   It is to be made clear that in the case where access domains A and 
   B are operated by different administrations (as in figure 1), the 
   moving host stands as the unique federation entity and would 
   therefore have to be more implicated in the mobility management. 
   Classical global mobility management schemes would probably have 
   to be used for this latter case. 
    
   As a general observation it is worth reminding that it is making 
   more and more sense from the market perspective to fill two 
   parallel  streams  and  families  of  solutions  for  mobility 
   management, respectively meeting the requirement of terminal and 
   network control. 
    
    
6.   Security Considerations 
    
   Part of network global mobility management requirement should be 
   not to incur additional security problems to those already 
   encountered by known gmm protocols. Any moving host always has to 
   get authenticated to the node that takes care of its mobility. 
   Such a node is the IP mobility anchor for classical gmm and could 
   be a different node for netgmm. 
    
    
7.   Conclusion 
    
   This document has tried to illustrate the problem of performing 
   network global mobility management with IETF already defined 
   solutions. The context has been confined to a specific family of 
   deployment scenarios, deemed to have the potential to grow wide 
   enough to legitimate dedicated solutions.
