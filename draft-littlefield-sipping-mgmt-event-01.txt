Abstract

   In many environments, firewall, NAT and IP addressing issues make
   remote management of devices containing SIP user agents difficult.
   This document defines a SIP event package for notifying a user agent
   that it should initiate a session with a management entity for
   management operations.  This type of "call-home" management avoids
   the need to maintain persistent TCP connections, or generate
   additional STUN traffic, with the management entity.  This event
   package is intended not to tunnel management protocols or otherwise

   provide management itself, but instead to provide a means for
   signaling a SIP UA that a management session is desired.

Internet-Draft    SIP Management Request Event Package      October 2006


1.  Introduction

   Element management is an important tool for troubleshooting and
   monitoring network entities.  When devices are directly addressable,
   and their addresses are known, or easily resolved, using DNS (Domain
   Name System), management protocols such as SNMP (Simple Network
   Management Protocol) work well for retrieving statistics and for
   examining and changing settings and state.  However, when NAT
   (Network Address Translator), NATP (NAT Protocol Translation) and
   firewall devices are between the managed entity and the management
   station, it may be difficult or impossible to initiate communication
   with the device in the normal way.  Examples of such deployments
   include service providers attempting to manage devices deployed in a
   subscriber's home, behind a typical home gateway device, as well as
   some multi-site enterprises.  Aside from remote manipulation of the
   firewall and NAT devices, these deployments typically require some
   form of "call-home" management, where the managed entity takes the
   initiative in establishing the management session or allowing for
   management transactions.

   Among the less attractive solutions to this problem are to have the
   managed entity maintain a persistent TCP connection to the management
   station, or to use STUN or similar frequent UDP exchanges to maintain
   a firewall pinhole or NATP port-mapping through which it may be
   reached.  An alternative is to use some out-of-band mechanism by
   which the entity can be contacted to notify it of the need for it to
   contact the management station for management using a standard
   management protocol.

   When the managed entity contains a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   [2] User Agent (and specifically when the entity's primary role is
   that of a SIP user agent), it's attractive to use the SIP protocol as
   the vehicle to request that the entity initiate a management session.
   The NAT and firewall traversal issues are already presumably solved
   in the environments where SIP is used across NATs and firewalls.  The
   ability to address the managed entity using a SIP URI rather than a
   hostname or IP address may be attractive as well, for example, in the
   case of an overlay voice service provider.

   The use of SIP to establish management sessions does have
   limitations, in that it depends on the device's ability to use SIP
   successfully, so this approach may not allow diagnosis and correction
   of a severely incapacitated device.  However, there are still
   significant benefits to this approach when compared to the complete
   lack of manageability.

   This document defines a SIP event package that allows the SIP user
   agent to subscribe to requests for management connections from a

Internet-Draft    SIP Management Request Event Package      October 2006


   particular management domain.  It does not specify the management
   protocol that will be used, but allows for a variety of management
   protocols.  It does not restrict notification content, in
   anticipation of supporting a variety of notification content
   appropriate to different protocols.

   This event package is considered complementary to the event package
   specified by the SIP user agent (UA) profile delivery framework [4],
   which defines mechanisms for configuration, but not management, of
   SIP user agents.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [1].

   Within this document, the term "device" may be used to refer to the
   managed entity.  This is not intended to imply any limitation to
   special purpose hardware devices and device management.  The managed
   entity may as easily be a software client or application to the
   extent that a particular management protocol is not, itself, limited
   to hardware devices.


3.  Overview of Operation

   When using this event package, the managed entity begins with the
   name of the domain to which it belongs for management purposes.  This
   domain name may be discovered via DHCP, manually configured, or
   obtained as part of a separate device configuration download (using
   the SIP UA profile delivery framework, for example).  This domain
   name enables the entity to form a unique request URI to which it will
   subscribe using this event package.

   The subscription request from the device (software or hardware)
   contains information about the management protocol or protocols that
   the device supports and expects to use.  In many situations, there is
   a standard and well-known management protocol to use, such as in the
   case of home telephony adapter devices managed by a service provider
   and conforming to a particular access network technology service
   standard.  In other situations, the device's configuration will
   dictate which of a set of possible management protocols are to be
   used.  In some situations, multiple transports of the same management
   protocol may be acceptable, and the device would indicate which of
   those protocols it supports.  If one or more of the indicated



Littlefield              Expires April 23, 2007                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    SIP Management Request Event Package      October 2006


   management protocols are acceptable to the management station, then
   it accepts the subscription.

   When the management station needs to contact the device to perform
   management operations, it sends a NOTIFY message to the device
   including information about the management protocol to use (selected
   from those offered in the SUBSCRIBE).  In some cases, this may
   include information about which management station to contact, but in
   many cases the management protocol contact information for the
   management station will be part of the device's configuration, and
   the NOTIFY will simply indicate the need to establish a session with
   this pre-configured station (or one of several).

   On receipt of the notification, the managed entity immediately
   connects to the management station using the indicated management
   protocol.  Authentication of this management session is dependent on
   the management protocol, device configuration, and authorization
   requirements of the device and the management station.


4.  Management Request Event Package

4.1.  Event Package Name

   This document defines a SIP Event Package as defined in RFC 3265 [3].
   The event package name is "management-req".  This value appears in
   the Event header field present in SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests for
   this package.

4.2.  Event Package Parameters

   This event package does not define any event package parameters.

4.3.  SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   The SUBSCRIBE request SHOULD contain a body.  The message body, if
   present, MUST communicate the set of management protocols that are
   supported by the managed device, using the content type "application/
   mgmt-protos-list" described below in Section 5.

   The SUBSCRIBE body MAY be empty only if the content-types listed in
   the "Accept" header each imply a particular management protocol (see
   Section 4.6).

4.4.  Subscription Duration

   Subscriptions to this event package MAY range from minutes to days.
   Subscriptions in hours are more typical and are RECOMMENDED, so that



Littlefield              Expires April 23, 2007                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    SIP Management Request Event Package      October 2006


   a lost subscription is detected within a reasonable amount of time.
   Since this event package is intended to allow the device to be
   managed, the subscription SHOULD be refreshed and maintained while
   the device is active and expecting to be managed.  The default
   expiration time for subscriptions within this event package is one
   hour.

4.5.  NOTIFY Bodies

   The NOTIFY request messages MAY contain bodies that are appropriate
   to specific management protocols, as indicated by the "Accept"
   headers in the SUBSCRIBE message.  A generally applicable body type
   ("application/mgmt-protos-list") for use with multiple protocols is
   specified below in Section 5.  If the "Accept" header is omitted, the
   "application/mgmt-protos-list" type is assumed.

4.6.  Subscriber Generation of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   The request URI of the SUBSCRIBE request SHOULD be formed exactly as
   "Device URIs" are formed according to the SIP UA profile delivery
   framework [4], section 7.13.1.  Similarly, the same URI discovery
   process, as defined in section 8.1.2 of that document, SHOULD be used
   to discover the host portion of the request URI and the destination
   addressing of the message, with the difference that in step 3,
   instead of prefixing the label "sipuaconfig" to domain name in the
   request URI, the label "sipmgmtrequest" should be used instead.

   The "To" and "From" headers will typically contain the same URI as is
   used in the SUBSCRIBE request.

   The "Accept" header MUST list the content-type(s) expected in the
   NOTIFY message body.  The "Accept" header MAY be omitted when the
   SUBSCRIBE message body is not empty, in which case the subscriber
   MUST accept NOTIFY bodies containing the default content type,
   "application/mgmt-protos-list".  If the "Accept" header content-types
   each imply a particular management protocol, the SUBSCRIBE message
   body MAY be empty.  For example, if a management protocol defines a
   notification content-type to be used in soliciting a device-initiated
   management session, the presence of that content-type in the
   SUBSCRIBE "Accept" header implicitly describes support for that
   management protocol.

   When the device knows it is shutting down or will become unreachable,
   the device SHOULD unsubscribe by sending a SUBSCRIBE message with an
   "Expires" header value of "0".

Internet-Draft    SIP Management Request Event Package      October 2006


4.7.  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   The general rules for notifier processing of SUBSCRIBE requests, as
   specified in RFC 3265 [3] apply.

   On receipt of a SUBSCRIBE message with the "management-req" event
   type, the notifier SHOULD authenticate the request.  If the notifier
   does not support any of the content-types specified in the "Accept"
   header of the SUBSCRIBE request, nor any of the management protocols
   listed in the SUBSCRIBE message body, or if the SUBSCRIBE request
   message omitted the "Accept" header and did not provide a message
   body of type "application/mgmt-protos-list", the subscription SHOULD
   be rejected.

   In accordance with RFC 3265 [3], the notifier MUST send a NOTIFY
   message immediately upon successfully accepting or refreshing a
   subscription.  If a management session is not desired at that time,
   the NOTIFY message MUST contain an empty body, indicating that this
   NOTIFY simply confirms the successful subscription and has no further
   meaning.

   The notifier MAY limit the duration of the subscription to an
   administratively configured period of time, as described in RFC 3265
   [3].

4.8.  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests

   When a management session with the managed device is desired (the
   mechanism for communicating this to the notifier is outside the scope
   of this specification), the notifier will form a NOTIFY request
   containing a message body appropriate to the acceptable types
   determined from the SUBSCRIBE request.  The NOTIFY message body will
   indicate, either implicitly or explicitly, through the content-type,
   the desired management protocol for the device to use when
   establishing a management session.

   The notifier MAY send a NOTIFY with an "Expires" header value of "0",
   a "Subscription-State" header value of "terminated", and a "reason"
   code of "deactivated" or "probation" to end the subscription in the
   event of shutdown.

   When a security association (e.g.  TLS) is used, the notifier SHOULD
   send the NOTIFY message over the same security association as the
   SUBSCRIBE request was received.

4.9.  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   The general rules for subscriber processing of NOTIFY requests, as



Littlefield              Expires April 23, 2007                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    SIP Management Request Event Package      October 2006


   specified in RFC 3265 [3] apply.

   Upon receipt of a valid NOTIFY request, the subscriber should
   evaluate the message body.  If the NOTIFY message body is empty, as
   will likely be the case for the initial NOTIFY following a new or
   refreshed subscription, no further action is required.  Otherwise,
   the subscriber MUST immediately attempt to establish a management
   session according to the mechanism and protocol indicated by the
   message body.  Considerations of whether a subscriber should attempt
   to establish multiple, parallel management sessions with the same
   management station are beyond the scope of this specification, and
   should be defined for each specific management protocol as
   appropriate.

4.10.  Handling of Forked Requests

   This event package does not allow forked requests to install multiple
   subscriptions.  The techniques of RFC 3265 [3] section 4.4.9 must be
   used to prevent establishment of multiple subscriptions due to
   forking.

4.11.  Rate of Notifications

   A notifier SHOULD implement a method to hold or otherwise avoid
   sending non-empty NOTIFY requests more frequently than some
   administratively-specified time interval.  A NOTIFY request in this
   event package indicates the desire to establish a management session,
   which may impose some overhead on both the managed device and the
   management station.  In some cases, all management sessions from the
   managed device will be established with the same pre-configured
   management station, further reducing the value of frequent
   notifications.  The NOTIFIER SHOULD apply rate limits that are
   appropriate for the connection mechanisms of the management protocols
   being used.

4.12.  State Agents

   State agents are not applicable to this event package.

4.13.  Examples of Usage

   This following call flows and message illustrations are purely
   informative.  Via headers are omitted from the message illustrations
   for clarity.

Internet-Draft    SIP Management Request Event Package      October 2006


   This shows a device sending a SUBSCRIBE for the management request
   event package to a management station (1):

       SUBSCRIBE sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@example.com SIP/2.0
       Event: management-req
       From: sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@example.com;tag=4039c9
       To: sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@example.com
       Call-ID: 02938403840@10.1.20.2
       CSeq: 298 SUBSCRIBE
       Contact: sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@10.1.20.2
       Accept: application/mgmt-protos-list
       Content-Type: application/mgmt-protos-list
       Content-Length: ...

       snmp-ssh

   The message body contains an indication that the device supports the
   SNMP over SSH management protocol, and expects to receive
   notifications containing content-type "application/mgmt-protos-list".

   The management station recognizes the requested management protocol
   type, "snmp-ssh", and accepts the subscription, issuing a 200 OK (2)
   to the SUBSCRIBE:

       SIP/2.0 200 OK
       From: sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@example.com;tag=4039c9
       To: sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@example.com;tag=11a89b
       Call-ID: 02938403840@10.1.20.2
       CSeq: 298 SUBSCRIBE
       Expires: 3600

   The management station then sends the initial NOTIFY request (3) with
   the current subscription state.  Since no management session is
   desired at this time, the NOTIFY message body is empty:

       NOTIFY sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@10.1.20.2 SIP/2.0
       From: sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@example.com;tag=11a89b

       Call-ID: 02938403840@10.1.20.2
       CSeq: 988 NOTIFY
       Event: reg
       Subscription-State: active
       Content-Length: 0

   The device responds with 200 OK (4).

Internet-Draft    SIP Management Request Event Package      October 2006


   At some later time, the management station needs to establish a
   management session with the device.  The management station sends a
   NOTIFY request (5) to the device requesting that the device establish
   a session using SNMP over SSH:

       NOTIFY sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@10.1.20.2 SIP/2.0
       From: sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@example.com;tag=11a89b
       To: sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@example.com;tag=4039c9
       Call-ID: 02938403840@10.1.20.2
       CSeq: 1022 NOTIFY
       Event: reg
       Content-Type: application/mgmt-protos-list
       Content-Length: ...

       snmp-ssh

   The device responds with 200 OK (6).

   The device then immediately initiates an SSH connection to the
   management station for SNMP (7)[5].  Once established, the management
   station can send SNMP GetRequest and SetRequest messages to the
   device to accomplish the needed task.

   In this example, the SSH connection is illustrated as being made to
   the same entity as the management station SIP UA, but there is no
   reason that must be the case.  In fact, we assume here that the SSH
   connection is made to a server whose name or address was pre-
   configured (possibly using the SIP UA profile delivery framework),
   and that management server may simply be coordinating with the
   notifier with a management connection is needed.

4.13.2.  Example using vendor-specific management protocol

   The following illustrates the use the event packet to negotiate and
   use a hypothetical vendor-specific management protocol, VNDX, which
   is carried over TCP.

Internet-Draft    SIP Management Request Event Package      October 2006


   This shows a device sending a SUBSCRIBE for the management request
   event package to a management station (1):

       SUBSCRIBE sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@example.com SIP/2.0
       Event: management-req
       From: sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@example.com;tag=4039c9
       To: sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@example.com
       Call-ID: 02938403840@10.1.20.2
       CSeq: 102 SUBSCRIBE
       Contact: sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@10.1.20.2
       Accept: application/mgmt-protos-list,application/vnd.vendx.notify
       Content-Type: application/mgmt-protos-list
       Content-Length: ...

       snmp-ssh

   The message body contains an indication that the device supports the
   SNMP over SSH management protocol.  The "Accept" header implicitly
   indicates that the device also supports the VNDX protocol by
   including the specific notification content-type defined for by that
   protocol ("application/vnd.vendx.notify").  The "Accept" header
   indicates that the device is prepared to receive notifications
   containing the VNDX notification format, as well as the general
   "application/mgmt-protos-list" content-type.

   If the device supported only the VNDX protocol, it would not have
   included the "application/mgmt-protos-list" content-type in the
   "Accept" header, and would not have included a SUBSCRIBE message
   body.

   The management station recognizes the vendor-specific management
   protocol, and accepts the subscription, issuing a 200 OK (2) to the
   SUBSCRIBE:

       SIP/2.0 200 OK
       From: sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@example.com;tag=4039c9
       To: sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@example.com;tag=11a89b
       Call-ID: 02938403840@10.1.20.2
       CSeq: 102 SUBSCRIBE
       Expires: 3600

Internet-Draft    SIP Management Request Event Package      October 2006


   The management station then sends the initial NOTIFY request (3) with
   the current subscription state.  Since no management session is
   desired at this time, the NOTIFY message body is empty:

       NOTIFY sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@10.1.20.2 SIP/2.0
       From: sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@example.com;tag=11a89b
       To: sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@example.com;tag=4039c9
       Call-ID: 02938403840@10.1.20.2
       CSeq: 520 NOTIFY
       Event: reg
       Subscription-State: active
       Content-Length: 0

   The device responds with 200 OK (4).

   At some later time, the management station needs to establish a
   management session with the device.  The management station sends a
   NOTIFY request (5) to the device requesting that the device establish
   a session using the VNDX protocol:

       NOTIFY sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@10.1.20.2 SIP/2.0
       From: sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@example.com;tag=11a89b
       To: sip:MAC%3aFF00000036C5@example.com;tag=4039c9
       Call-ID: 02938403840@10.1.20.2
       CSeq: 552 NOTIFY
       Event: reg
       Content-Type: application/vnd.vendx.notify
       Content-Length: ...

       REQUEST VNDX/1.0
       session-id: f09920abe99d0
       nonce: XOIMJ0982JOJ00S0
       time: 1161365287
       sig: 7868881CA0719777B3280EB3490DC176


   The device responds with 200 OK (6).

   The device then immediately initiates a TCP connection to the
   management station for the VNDX protocol.  Once established, the
   management station can send VNDX protocol messages to the device to
   accomplish the needed task.


5.  Management Protocol List Document

   [[Comment.1: This document structure needs to be defined.  It is
   anticipated to contain an ordered list of management protocols, where

Internet-Draft    SIP Management Request Event Package      October 2006


   each management protocol may be composed of a protocol part and a
   transport part, such as "snmp-udp", "snmp-ssh", "snmp-tls", or "snmp-
   tcp".  Consideration must be given to whether or not an existing
   protocol name registry can be used, or a new IANA registry must be
   created.]]


6.  Security Considerations

   The intent of this event package is to enable establishment of
   management sessions.  The security aspects of the management session
   itself are beyond the scope of this specification, but must be
   strongly considered when this event package is used.  Mutual
   authentication of the resulting management session SHOULD be
   provided, though this depends on the authorization policies of both
   the managed device and the management station, and the operations
   that will be allowed.

   The security concerns of this event package itself depend to some
   extent on its use.  In a scenario where the NOTIFY does not contain
   any information about which management station to contact, as is true
   for the NOTIFY message body content-type defined in this document, a
   forged or altered NOTIFY message will result in directing the managed
   device to an attacker for establishment of a management session.
   However, a form of denial of service (DOS) attack may result of the
   managed device does not rate limit its own attempts to establish
   management sessions.

   The authenticity of the NOTIFY source, and, in the case of NOTIFY
   message bodies which direct the managed device to a particular
   management server, the NOTIFY message body, SHOULD be ensured by use
   of appropriate end-to-end or hop-by-hop security mechanisms defined
   in RFC 3261 [2].
