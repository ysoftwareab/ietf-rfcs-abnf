         DHCPv6-Shield: Protecting Against Rogue DHCPv6 Servers
                   draft-ietf-opsec-dhcpv6-shield-06

Abstract

   This document specifies a mechanism for protecting hosts connected to
   a switched network against rogue DHCPv6 servers.  It is based on
   DHCPv6 packet-filtering at the layer-2 device at which the packets
   are received.  A similar mechanism has been widely deployed in IPv4
   networks ('DHCP snooping'), and hence it is desirable that similar
   functionality be provided for IPv6 networks.  This document specifies
   a Best Current Practice for the implementation of DHCPv6 Shield.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies DHCPv6-Shield: a mechanism for protecting
   hosts connected to a switched network against rogue DHCPv6 servers
   [RFC3315].  The basic concept behind DHCPv6-Shield is that a layer-2
   device filters DHCPv6 messages meant to DHCPv6 clients (henceforth
   "DHCPv6-server messages"), according to a number of different
   criteria.  The most basic filtering criterion is that DHCPv6-server
   messages are discarded by the layer-2 device unless they are received
   on a specific ports of the layer-2 device.

   Before the DCHPv6-Shield device is deployed, the administrator
   specifies the layer-2 port(s) on which DHCPv6-server messages are to
   be allowed.  Only those ports to which a DHCPv6 server or relay is to
   be connected should be specified as such.  Once deployed, the
   DHCPv6-Shield device inspects received packets, and allows (i.e.
   passes) DHCPv6-server messages only if they are received on layer-2
   ports that have been explicitly configured for such purpose.

   DHCPv6-Shield is analogous to the RA-Guard mechanism [RFC6104]
   [RFC6105] [RFC7113], intended for protection against rogue Router
   Advertisement [RFC4861] messages.

   We note that DHCPv6-Shield only mitigates only DHCPv6-based attacks
   against hosts.  Attack vectors based on other messages meant for
   network configuration (such as ICMPv6 Router Advertisements) are not
   addressed by DHCPv6-Shield itself.  In a similar vein,

   DHCPv6-Shielddoes not mitigate attacks against DHCPv6 servers (e.g.,
   Denial of Service).

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   DHCPv6-Shield:

      the set of filtering rules specified in this document, meant to
      mitigate attacks that employ DHCPv6-server packets.

   DHCPv6-Shield device:

      A layer-2 device (typically a layer-2 switch) that enforces the
      filtering policy specified in this document.

   For the purposes of this document, the terms Extension Header, Header
   Chain, First Fragment, and Upper-layer Header are used as specified
   in [RFC7112]:

   IPv6 Extension Header:

      Extension Headers are defined in Section 4 of [RFC2460].  As a
      result of [RFC7045], [IANA-PROTO] provides a list of assigned
      Internet Protocol Numbers and designates which of those protocol
      numbers also represent extension headers.

   First Fragment:

      An IPv6 fragment with fragment offset equal to 0.

   IPv6 Header Chain:

      The header chain contains an initial IPv6 header, zero or more
      IPv6 extension headers, and optionally, a single upper-layer
      header.  If an upper-layer header is present, it terminates the
      header chain; otherwise the "No Next Header" value (Next Header =
      59) terminates it.

      The first member of the header chain is always an IPv6 header.
      For a subsequent header to qualify as a member of the header
      chain, it must be referenced by the "Next Header" field of the
      previous member of the header chain.  However, if a second IPv6



Gont, et al.             Expires August 29, 2015                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                DHCPv6-Shield                February 2015


      header appears in the header chain, as is the case when IPv6 is
      tunneled over IPv6, the second IPv6 header is considered to be an
      upper-layer header and terminates the header chain.  Likewise, if
      an Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) header appears in the
      header chain it is considered to be an upper-layer header and it
      terminates the header chain.

   Upper-layer Header:

      In the general case, the upper-layer header is the first member of
      the header chain that is neither an IPv6 header nor an IPv6
      extension header.  However, if either an ESP header, or a second
      IPv6 header occur in the header chain, they are considered to be
      upper layer headers and they terminate the header chain.

      Neither the upper-layer payload, nor any protocol data following
      the upper-layer payload, is considered to be part of the header
      chain.  In a simple example, if the upper-layer header is a TCP
      header, the TCP payload is not part of the header chain.  In a
      more complex example, if the upper-layer header is an ESP header,
      neither the payload data, nor any of the fields that follow the
      payload data in the ESP header are part of the header chain.

4.  DHCPv6-Shield Configuration

   Before being deployed for production, the DHCPv6-Shield device is
   explicitly configured with respect to which layer-2 ports are allowed
   to receive DHCPv6 packets destined to DHCPv6 clients (i.e.
   DHCPv6-server messages).  Only those layer-2 ports explicitly
   configured for such purpose will be allowed to receive DHCPv6 packets
   to DHCPv6 clients.

5.  DHCPv6-Shield Implementation Advice

   The following are the filtering rules that are enforced as part of a
   DHCPv6-Shield implementation on those ports that are not allowed to
   receive DHCPv6 packets to DHCPv6 clients:

   1.  DHCPv6-Shield MUST parse the entire IPv6 header chain present in
       the packet, to identify whether it is a DHCPv6 packet meant for a
       DHCPv6 client (i.e., a DHCPv6-server message).

          RATIONALE: DHCPv6-Shield implementations MUST NOT enforce a
          limit on the number of bytes they can inspect (starting from
          the beginning of the IPv6 packet), since this could introduce
          false-negatives: DHCP6-server packets received on ports not
          allowed to receive such packets could be allowed simply




Gont, et al.             Expires August 29, 2015                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                DHCPv6-Shield                February 2015


          because the DHCPv6-Shield device does not parse the entire
          IPv6 header chain present in the packet.

   2.  When parsing the IPv6 header chain, if the packet is a first-
       fragment (i.e., a packet containing a Fragment Header with the
       Fragment Offset set to 0) and it fails to contain the entire IPv6
       header chain (i.e., all the headers starting from the IPv6 header
       up to, and including, the upper-layer header), DHCPv6-Shield MUST
       drop the packet, and ought to log the packet drop event in an
       implementation-specific manner as a security fault.

          RATIONALE: Packets that fail to contain the IPv6 header chain
          could otherwise be leveraged for circumventing DHCPv6-Shield.
          [RFC7112] requires that the first-fragment (i.e., the fragment
          with the Fragment Offset set to 0) contains the entire IPv6
          header chain, and allows intermediate systems such as routers
          to drop those packets that fail to comply with this
          requirement.

          NOTE: This rule should only be applied to IPv6 fragments with
          a Fragment Offset of 0 (non-first fragments can be safely
          passed, since they will never reassemble into a complete
          datagram if they are part of a DHCPv6 packet meant for a
          DHCPv6 client received on a port where such packets are not
          allowed).

   3.  DHCPv6-Shield MUST provide a configuration knob that controls
       whether packets with unrecognized Next Header values are dropped;
       this configuration knob MUST default to "drop".  When parsing the
       IPv6 header chain, if the packet contains an unrecognized Next
       Header value and the configuration knob is configured to "drop",
       DHCPv6-Shield MUST drop the packet, and ought to log the packet
       drop event in an implementation-specific manner as a security
       alert.

          RATIONALE: An unrecognized Next Header value could possibly
          identify an IPv6 Extension Header, and thus be leveraged to
          conceal a DHCPv6-server packet (since there is no way for
          DHCPv6-Shield to parse past unrecognized Next Header values
          [I-D.gont-6man-rfc6564bis]).  [RFC7045] requires that nodes be
          configurable with respect to whether packets with unrecognized
          headers are forwarded, and allows the default behavior to be
          that such packets be dropped.

   4.  In all other cases, DHCPv6-Shield MUST pass the packet as usual.

      NOTE: For the purpose of enforcing the DHCPv6-Shield filtering
      policy, an ESP header [RFC4303] should be considered to be an



Gont, et al.             Expires August 29, 2015                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                DHCPv6-Shield                February 2015


      "upper-layer protocol" (that is, it should be considered the last
      header in the IPv6 header chain).  This means that packets
      employing ESP would be passed by the DHCPv6-Shield device to the
      intended destination.  If the destination host does not have a
      security association with the sender of the aforementioned IPv6
      packet, the packet would be dropped.  Otherwise, if the packet is
      considered valid by the IPsec implementation at the receiving host
      and encapsulates a DHCPv6 message, it is up to the receiving host
      what to do with such packet.

   The above indicates that if a packet is dropped due to this filtering
   policy, the packet drop event be logged in an implementation-specific
   manner as a security fault.  It is useful for the logging mechanism
   to include a per-port drop counter dedicated to DHCPv6-Shield packet
   drops.

   In order to protect current end-node IPv6 implementations, Rule #2
   has been defined as a default rule to drop packets that cannot be
   positively identified as not being DHCPv6-server packets (because the
   packet is a fragment that fails to include the entire IPv6 header
   chain).  This means that, at least in theory, DHCPv6-Shield could
   result in false-positive blocking of some legitimate (non
   DHCPv6-server) packets.  However, as noted in [RFC7112], IPv6 packets
   that fail to include the entire IPv6 header chain are virtually
   impossible to police with state-less filters and firewalls, and hence
   are unlikely to survive in real networks.  [RFC7112] requires that
   hosts employing fragmentation include the entire IPv6 header chain in
   the first fragment (the fragment with the Fragment Offset set to 0),
   thus eliminating the aforementioned false positives.

   The aforementioned filtering rules implicitly handle the case of
   fragmented packets: if the DHCPv6-Shield device fails to identify the
   upper-layer protocol as a result of the use of fragmentation, the
   corresponding packets would be dropped.

   Finally, we note that IPv6 implementations that allow overlapping
   fragments (i.e. that do not comply with [RFC5722]) might still be
   subject of DHCPv6-based attacks.  However, a recent assessment of
   IPv6 implementations [SI6-FRAG] with respect to their fragment
   reassembly policy seems to indicate that most current implementations
   comply with [RFC5722].

7.  Security Considerations

   The recommendations in this document represent the ideal behavior of
   a DHCPv6 shield device.  However, in order to implement DHCPv6 shield
   on the fast path, it may be necessary to limit the depth into the
   packet that can be scanned before giving up.  In circumstances where
   there is such a limitation, it is recommended that implementations
   drop packets after attempting to find a protocol header up to that
   limit, whatever it is.  Ideally, such devices should be configurable
   with a list of protocol header identifiers so that if new transport
   protocols are standardized after the device is released, they can be
   added to the list of protocol header types that the device
   recognizes.  Since any protocol header that is not a UDP header would
   be passed by the DHCPv6 shield algorithm, this would allow such
   devices to avoid blocking the use of new transport protocols.  When
   an implementation must stop searching for recognizable header types
   in a packet due to such limitations, whether the device passes or
   drop that packet SHOULD be configurable.

   The mechanism specified in this document can be used to mitigate
   DHCPv6-based attacks against hosts.  Attack vectors based on other
   messages meant for network configuration (such as ICMPv6 Router
   Advertisements) are out of the scope of this document.  Additionally,
   the mechanism specified in this document does not mitigate attacks
   against DHCPv6 servers (e.g., Denial of Service).

   If deployed in layer-2 domain with several cascading switches, there
   will be an ingress port on the host's local switch which will need to
   be enabled for receiving DHCPv6-server messages.  However, this local
   switch will be reliant on the upstream devices to have filtered out
   rogue DHCPv6-server messages, as the local switch has no way of
   determining which upstream DHCP-server messages are valid.
   Therefore, in order to be effective DHCPv6 Shield should be deployed
   and enabled on all layer-2 switches of a given layer-2 domain.

   As noted in Section 5, IPv6 implementations that allow overlapping
   fragments (i.e. that do not comply with [RFC5722]) might still be
   subject of DHCPv6-based attacks.  However, most current
   implementations seem to comply with [RFC5722], and hence forbid IPv6
   overlapping fragments.

   We note that if an attacker sends a fragmented DHCPv6 packet on a
   port not allowed to receive such packets, the first-fragment would be
   dropped, and the rest of the fragments would be passed.  This means
   that the victim node would tie memory buffers for the aforementioned
   fragments, which would never reassemble into a complete datagram.  If
   a large number of such packets were sent by an attacker, and the
   victim node failed to implement proper resource management for the



Gont, et al.             Expires August 29, 2015                [Page 7]

   fragment reassembly buffer, this could lead to a Denial of Service
   (DoS).  However, this does not really introduce a new attack vector,
   since an attacker could always perform the same attack by sending
   forged fragmented datagram in which at least one of the fragments is
   missing.  [CPNI-IPv6] discusses some resource management strategies
   that could be implemented for the fragment reassembly buffer.

   Additionally, we note that the security of a site employing DHCPv6
   Shield could be further improved by deploying [I-D.ietf-savi-dhcp],
   to mitigate IPv6 address spoofing attacks.

   Finally, we note that other mechanisms for mitigating attacks based
   on DHCPv6-server messages are available that have different
   deployment considerations.  For example, [I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6]
   allows for authentication of DHCPv6-server packets if the IPv6
   addresses of the DHCPv6 servers can be pre-configured at the client
   nodes.
