1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)
   which is used between a Path Computation Element (PCE) and a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) (or other PCE) to enable computation of
   Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) for Traffic Engineering Label
   Switched Path (TE LSP).  PCEP Extensions for the Stateful PCE Model
   [RFC8231] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable active
   control of MPLS-TE and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) tunnels.  [RFC8281]
   describes the setup and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the
   active stateful PCE model, without the need for local configuration
   on the PCC, thus allowing for dynamic centralized control of a
   network.

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  Segment
   Routing can be instantiated on MPLS data plane which is referred to
   as SR-MPLS [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls].  SR-MPLS leverages
   the MPLS label stack to construct the SR path.  PCEP Extensions for
   Segment Routing [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] specifies extensions
   to the PCEP that allow a stateful PCE to compute and initiate TE
   paths, as well as a PCC to request a path subject to certain
   constraint(s) and optimization criteria in SR networks.

   Entropy label (EL) [RFC6790] is a technique used in the MPLS data
   plane to provide entropy for load-balancing.  Entropy Label Indicator
   (ELI) can be immediately preceding an EL in the MPLS label stack.
   The idea behind the EL is that the ingress router computes a hash
   based on several fields from a given packet and places the result in

   an additional label, named "entropy label".  Then, this entropy label
   can be used as part of the hash keys used by an LSR.  Using the
   entropy label as part of the hash keys reduces the need for deep
   packet inspection in the LSR while keeping a good level of entropy in
   the load-balancing.  When the entropy label is used, the keys used in
   the hashing functions are still a local configuration matter and an
   LSR may use solely the entropy label or a combination of multiple
   fields from the incoming packet.

   [I-D.ietf-mpls-spring-entropy-label] proposes to use entropy labels
   for SR-MPLS networks.  The Entropy Readable Label Depth (ERLD) is
   defined as the number of labels which means that the router will
   perform load-balancing using the ELI/EL.  An appropriate algorithm
   would consider the following goals:

   o  a limited number of <ELI, EL> pairs should be inserted deeper in
      the label-stack.

   o  the inserted position should be whithin the ERLD of most transit
      nodes.

   o  a minimum number of <ELI, EL> to satisfy the above criteria.

   In some cases, It is required for the controller (e.g.  PCE) to
   perform the TE path computation as well as the Entropy Label Position
   (ELP), because the contoller has the ERLD information of all nodes,
   especially for inter-domain scenarios.  This document proposes a set
   of extensions for PCEP to configure the ELP information for SR-MPLS
   networks.

3.  PCEP Extensions

3.1.  The OPEN Object

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing], PCEP speakers use SR
   PCE Capability sub-TLV to exchange information about their SR
   capability when PST=1 in the PST List of the PATH-SETUP-TYPE-
   CAPABILITY TLV carried in Open object.  This document defined a new
   flag (E-flag) for SR PCE Capability sub-TLV as shown in Figure 1.

   E (ELP Configuration is supported) : A PCC or PCE sets this flag bit

   with ELP configuration.

3.2.  The LSP Object

   The LSP Object is defined in Section 7.3 of [RFC8231].  This document
   defiend a new flag (E-flag) for the LSP Object as Figure 2 shown:

   ELP information is included by PCE and encoded in the PCRep, PCUpd or
   PCInitiate message.

3.3.  The ERO Object

   SR-ERO subobject is used for SR-TE path which consists of one or more
   SIDs as defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing].  This document
   defiend a new flag (E-flag) for the SR-ERO subobject as Figure 3
   shown:


           0                   1                   2                   3

                   Figure 3: E-flag in SR-ERO subobject

   E (ELP Configuration) : If this flag is set, it means that the
   position after this SR-ERO subobject is the position to insert <ELI,
   EL>, otherwise it cannot insert <ELI, EL> after this segment.

4.  Operations

   The SR path is initiated by PCE or PCC with PCReq, PCInitiated or
   PCUpd messages and the E bit is set to 1 in LSP object to request the
   ELP configuration.  The SR-TE path being recieved by PCC with SR-ERO
   segment list, for example, <S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6>, especially S3
   and S6 with E-flag set.  It indicates that two <ELI, EL> pairs MUST
   be inserted into the label stack of the SR-TE forwarding entry,
   repectively after the label for S3 and label for S6.  With EL
   information, the label stack for SR-MPLS would be <label1, label2,
   label3, ELI, EL, label4, label5, label6, ELI, EL>.
