Abstract

This memo outlines the nature of the Internet Engineering Task Force 
(IETF) as an unincorporated association, reviews some history of the 
IETF Secretariat relevant to the current structure of the organization, 
and proposes steps that might be taken to move forward in the interest 
of the Internet community more generally. Since the IETF serves as a 
focal point in the technical evolution of the Internet infrastructure, 
it is important that any organizational changes take into account the 
wider public interest. Considerations of who provides support to the 
IETF hinge on the legal status of the IETF itself. Steps should be 
taken to clarify this matter as a first priority.

1. Establishment of the IETF Secretariat: CNRI Initiative

In the late 1970s, the Internet Configuration Control Board (ICCB) was 
established by DARPA as an informal group of twelve individuals to 
participate with DARPA in discussions concerning the development and 
evolution of Internet protocols and processes. By the early 1980s, the 
ICCB meetings had grown to include several hundred interested observers, 
resulting in the need to coordinate meetings with many individuals and 
requiring large conference facilities to host the meetings. In 1983, it 
was decided by DARPA to create a new organization called the Internet 
Activities Board (IAB), also consisting of twelve members (most of the 
same ICCB members became IAB members) and to create ten working 
groups under the IAB to carry on detailed technical discussions and 
other activities. This structure allowed the body of interested 
observers to become more active participants in the working group 
activities, which were held at various times and places as the working 
group Chairs determined. As a result, meetings of the IAB became more 
manageable in almost every way -- at least for a while.

Although DARPA made the technical decisions concerning Internet 
standards initially, it empowered the IAB to take responsibility for 
this function, while still retaining the ability to oversee its 
decisions. By the mid 1980s, the number of working groups had grown 
considerably; and the IAB preferred to delegate responsibility for 
the management of the working groups. This responsibility was given to 
one of the original ten working groups, called "Internet Engineering" 
which had the responsibility for helping to manage the myriad technical 
details to bring the Internet into practical use by the research 
community. This working group became the Internet Engineering Task Force 
(IETF). At that time, the IETF was composed mainly of contractors (from 
industry, academia and non-profit organizations) working on DARPA's 
Internet research program. This program was initiated by Dr. Robert 
E. Kahn, and later managed by Dr. Kahn, Dr Vinton G. Cerf and 
Dr. Barry Leiner.

In 1986, in coordination with DARPA, the National Science Foundation 
(NSF) assumed responsibility for the Internet. NSF created the NSFNET, 
a high-speed network that replaced the ARPANET as a backbone for the 
Internet. NSF shepherded the Internet from its early operational days, 
until 1995, when the NSFNET support was ended and commercial service 
providers took over. Dr. Steve Wolff led the innovative efforts at NSF 
for most of that period. NSF worked closely with other agencies in the 
Federal Government to gain their participation and support. Earlier 
efforts supported by NSF to create the CSNET, led by Prof. Larry 
Landweber and others, were important milestones leading to the creation 
of the NSFNET and a broadening of the role of networking to the entire 
computer science research community. An authoritative description of 
the origins of the Internet may be found in "A Brief History of 
the Internet"(1).  

The IETF as we know it today was formed in 1986 "as a forum for 
technical coordination by contractors working on the ARPANET, DDN, 
and the Internet core gateway system."(2) By the time of the twentieth 
session of the IETF in 1991, the IETF had grown considerably in stature 
to encompass an open and diverse community of "network designers, 
operators, vendors and researchers concerned with the evolution of the 
Internet protocol architecture and the smooth operation of the Internet."

In 1986, after leaving DARPA, Bob Kahn formed the Corporation for 
National Research Initiatives (CNRI) with the help of Vint Cerf who 
rejoined him after spending four years at MCI building the MCI Mail 
System. In light of the growth in the scope of the IETF effort, in 1988, 
CNRI submitted a proposal to the National Science Foundation (NSF) to 
help organize and support the community of researchers involved in the 
Internet, and principally the IAB and the IETF which operated under the 
aegis of the IAB. As part of the contemplated work, CNRI established a 
dedicated "secretariat" to support the Internet Activities Board and its 
subsidiary Task Force -- the IETF.  

Effective March 1, 1989, but providing support going back to late 1988, 
CNRI and NSF entered into Cooperative Agreement No. NCR-8820945.  
Under this Cooperative Agreement, CNRI agreed to create and provide a 
secretariat for the "overall coordination, management and support of the 
work of the IAB, its various task forces and, particularly, the IETF." 
This effort included, among other tasks, organizing and developing plans 
for projects in coordination with the leadership of the Internet 
Activities Board; work with the IETF Chair to organize and conduct IETF 
meetings; management of outside IETF-related subcontracts; and provision 
of technical and administrative support to what was then called the 
Internet Mid-Term Architect and the IETF Chair.  In fact, the Chair of 
the IETF was a CNRI employee for the first few years of the Cooperative 
Agreement.

CNRI efforts in support of the Internet Activities Board and the IETF 
continued for many years under the Cooperative Agreement. During this 
period, CNRI took steps to provide structure to the evolving 
responsibilities being assumed by the IETF to meet the demands of the 
rapidly growing Internet community. For example:

     o In 1991, Corporation for National Research Initiatives took steps 
to help form the Internet Society; and, in 1992, CNRI led the effort to 
incorporate the Internet Society, and provided support services for 
this new entity until such time as it was able to establish an 
independent presence.  One motivating factor was to separate the 
responsibility for developing recommendations for standards, 
which was the responsibility of the IETF, from the decision-making 
responsibility of the IAB. 

     It was understood that a certain degree of liability attached to 
the making of standards. The reality was that the IAB ratified 
generally accepted practices and procedures in moving recommendations to 
full standards, but the IAB documents only stated that they made 
standards. Efforts were made to convince the IAB to revise their 
written documents to reflect the reality; but this suggestion was 
considered and rejected by the IAB. Another motivating factor in 
this endeavor was the interest expressed by many in the Internet 
community to bring the Internet Activities Board into a structure that 
was in some way responsible to a wider Internet community. It 
was decided to cease operations of this group, and to constitute a 
new group called the Internet Architecture Board.(3) 

     o As discussed in an article by Dr. Vinton G. Cerf, then Vice 
President of CNRI and IAB Chair, CNRI worked with the IETF to organize 
a steering group to provide technical and managerial leadership that 
came to be known as the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG). 
The IESG consisted of the IETF Chair and the various Area Directors, 
under which the various working groups were organized.(4)   

On November 28, 1994, CNRI submitted a follow-on proposal entitled 
"Support of the IETF Operations" to the National Science Foundation.  
On the basis of this proposal, CNRI entered into Cooperative 
Agreement No. NCR-9528103 with NSF, that was effective from 
August 1, 1995 through 1997. In making this award, NSF noted that 
CNRI had, under the prior Cooperative Agreement, "created and 
provided a functioning IETF Secretariat, and has been helping to 
organize and support these activities which involve thousands of 
individual participants and contributors from the U.S. and abroad." 
It was noted, however, that NSF did not reserve any responsibility 
for accomplishing the purposes of the Cooperative Agreement, and 
such responsibilities remained with CNRI.

Upon the expiration of the Cooperative Agreement, CNRI continued to 
provide the IETF Secretariat and to work with the IETF leadership in 
separating the administrative from the technical aspects of the support 
services CNRI had been providing. Although meeting fees were first 
introduced around 1991 to help offset the cost of the IEFT Secretariat 
functions, and to supplement Government funding, by 1998, funding 
for the provision of the IETF Secretariat services derived from IETF 
meeting fees and other sources was deemed sufficient to cover the 
costs. CNRI took full financial responsibility for the operations of 
the IETF during this period. Where deficits occurred, CNRI stepped in 
to cover the expenses in order to keep the IETF Secretariat running 
smoothly for the benefit of the IETF and the Internet community more 
generally. Surpluses were retained to cover unexpected expenses and 
possible future liabilities. CNRI did not charge service fees or burden 
the IETF with charges for legal assistance to the IETF Secretariat.

In an effort to provide long-term stability for the IETF Secretariat, to 
encourage the support staff and to reduce operating costs, CNRI 
established a for-profit subsidiary, Foretec Seminars, Inc. (Foretec) to 
furnish services to assist CNRI in carrying out its IETF Secretariat 
responsibilities. From January 1, 1998 and continuing to the present, 
Foretec is charged by CNRI with running the day to day operations of 
the IETF Secretariat.(5) In addition, Foretec attempted to build a more 
comprehensive seminars business, but the effect of the economic 
downturn in 2000 combined with the aftermath of the events of 9/11 
militated against their success in the short term.  While Foretec has 
provided the IETF Secretariat function since 1998, CNRI still retains 
the overall responsibility for the operation of the IETF Secretariat. 
The low key role played by CNRI since 1998, in terms of visibility in 
IETF activities, may have led some to think of CNRI as synonymous with 
Foretec. In reality, CNRI has continued to provide the contractual 
vehicle and oversight enabling Foretec to provide these functions.

2. Proposed Organizational Changes 

     o It is time to incorporate the IETF

In order for the IETF to continue to run smoothly, as the Internet 
continues to grow and expand worldwide, it appears desirable for the 
IETF leadership and the Internet community more generally, to 
reconsider the current legal status of the Internet Engineering Task 
Force. It has been many years since the IETF was simply a small Task 
Force of researchers working under DARPA funding and direction.  
Recently, there has been some recognition of the IETF as an 
unincorporated association,(6) a notion that CNRI had posed on several 
occasions in the past. Indeed, some may argue that the current 
structure of the IETF is working fine and need not change. While the 
IETF need not formally incorporate to act as an organization that can 
carry out business -- just as if it was formally incorporated, a 
carefully considered change to the informal status quo at this time 
seems appropriate.

Establishing a separate corporate structure for the IETF is really not a 
very difficult or expensive step. The current operating procedures for 
the IETF standards process could be incorporated in proposed By-
Laws, and the current IESG could be asked to serve as the Board of 
Directors of the corporate structure. The following steps would seem 
appropriate, whether the IETF incorporates now or whether it 
continues to operate as an unincorporated association for a period of 
time.

Whether or not the IETF decides to rely on one or more outside 
contractors to provide administrative, financial, legal or other support 
services, the responsibility for hiring and supervising any IETF 
support services remains with the IETF and its leadership. In this 
context, for the IETF to relegate the oversight for these services to 
third parties in order to focus solely on technical standards may not be 
appropriate or workable in practice. 

As will be discussed further below, at least one aspect of the financial 
support services for the IETF may be carried out by the IETF 
leadership in cooperation with a new, separately incorporated entity, 
called herein for discussion purposes, the IETF Foundation. The 
Foundation would be charged with fund-raising for the IETF, but 
would not control the IETF itself. This and other structural steps 
suggested in this memo would maintain "checks and balances" among 
the providers of various support services to the IETF. This balance is 
necessary in order to continue the tradition of technical independence 
of the IETF standards process from undue influence of third party 
financial contributors. While some would argue that the technical 
activities of the IETF are carried out without any input or assistance 
from the organizations providing administrative support, in practice, 
support organizations play an active role is assisting the IETF in its 
standard-setting activities. This is particularly evident in relation 
to the work of the IESG.

     o Hire an IETF Executive Director

A first act of the newly restructured or incorporated IETF would be the 
recruitment of a professional Executive Director. This person should be 
highly qualified in operating the administrative responsibilities of the 
IETF. The IETF leadership should spell out in some detail the exact 
duties of this person.  

     o Retain an Attorney and an Accountant for the IETF
	
If the newly appointed Executive Director is neither an Attorney-at-Law 
nor an Accountant, then the Executive Director should enter into a 
search operation to retain the services of such professionals, and 
present a list of names to the IETF leadership so that they might make 
a selection of qualified persons. These would likely not be staff 
positions. A second task for the Executive Director would be the 
negotiation of insurance coverage for IETF activities. Undoubtedly, 
this would require close coordination with ISOC in order to ensure 
uninterrupted protection for the IETF leadership.

     o Authorize the Executive Director to secure office space

While securing office space may seem fairly straightforward, it may 
entail negotiations with any of several organizations for such support. 
If the IETF were incorporated as a non-profit organization, however, 
it may wish to find separate office space. In any event, office space 
should be obtained to the extent possible on a reduced rental basis, 
perhaps with shared facilities, such as reception and mail service, with 
another organization in order to reduce operating costs.

     o Negotiate contracts with the various IETF support organizations
      
Once the basic structure is in place, and this change should not take 
too much time or effort, the IESG should then instruct the Executive 
Director to open negotiations with the various IETF support 
organizations. Legal advice should be obtained on how best to carry 
out the negotiations and who would actually sign on behalf of the IETF 
corporate entity. Most critical to this task is to determine how the 
Executive Director, on behalf of the IETF, would interface with the 
various support organizations. 

The most critical issues would concern establishing budgets and 
responsibilities, negotiating changes to budgets, enabling funding 
to cover added costs, where appropriate, and establishing metrics 
on performance so that the support organizations understand what the 
limits of demand on them would be for the given agreed levels of 
support. Where activities can be supported from meeting fees, such 
as has been the case with the IETF Secretariat in recent years, 
means to augment such funding need to be developed and understood 
by all parties when additional requirements are placed on the 
support organizations, such as the IETF Secretariat.

     o IETF Secretariat

Coming back to where this memo began: the IETF Secretariat. The first 
organization that should be retained by the new IETF corporate entity is 
the IETF Secretariat. The IETF Secretariat, as noted above, was created 
by and has been provided to date by Corporation for National Research 
Initiatives. CNRI has informed the IETF leadership that it will enter 
into discussions with the IETF leadership as to how best to accomplish 
a transition to some new entity, if this is the consensus of the IETF 
community, and to work with the IETF leadership in this process. In the 
interim, CNRI will continue to provide the IETF Secretariat on behalf 
of the IETF until such time as any new arrangements are in place. 
Once a suitable organization has been identified to carry out the 
IETF Secretariat functions in the public interest, CNRI will work 
with the IETF leadership to enable a smooth transition. 

     o RFC Editor

The RFC Editor is currently funded by the Internet Society. Here the 
decision for the IETF leadership is the timing for transitioning the 
current contract between USC/ISI and the Internet Society under the 
aegis of the IETF. This decision exists whether or not the IETF 
formally incorporates or not. At what point the agreement should be 
negotiated by the IETF Executive Director would be determined by the 
IETF leadership with advice from IETF legal counsel. Coordination with 
ISOC is essential to accomplishing this transition.

Further, it should be noted that a recent judicial decision in the 
United States called into question the basic notion of a "Request 
for Comments." The court appeared to view these documents which are 
used to promulgate formal Internet standards, as simply a continuing 
dialogue, rather than a standards document. It appears desirable to 
start a new formal document series with a more appropriate name to 
address this situation. There are trademark issues that would need to 
be addressed in connection with the naming of such a new document 
series.

As IETF members are well aware (and persons attending and participating 
in IETF activities may be viewed as "members"), intellectual property 
rights (IPR), and how they are managed, are also important subjects for 
discussion and negotiation. The IETF corporate entity should clarify 
ownership rights, and limitations, in material contributed to the IETF 
process. Ownership, if any, should vest in the IETF. Currently, as 
evidenced by the requirement for an Internet Society copyright notice on 
certain IETF documents, it has been asserted that some rights vest in 
the Internet Society; however, ISOC's claim to ownership rights may be 
questioned. Contributors grant ISOC and IETF a non-exclusive license in 
their contributions (including any contributed abstract); there is no 
formal transfer of copyright to either organization. Elements such as 
layout, RFC numbering and prefatory material (e.g., disclaimer language) 
may not support claims to copyright. While BCP78 is a helpful start, 
there should be further clarification of the basis for any Internet 
Society claims to copyright in IETF documentation. This issue would 
certainly come up for discussion if a decision were reached on a new 
IETF numbering series for standards documents.

The subject of patent claims in proposed standards track documents is 
another matter that should be addressed by the IETF leadership. There 
have been suggestions that ISOC take on some responsibility for 
overseeing the negotiation of IPR arrangements. Such matters are at 
best controversial, but, equally, they are vitally important for the 
continued success of the IETF. Patent claims will continue to be a 
central issue for the IETF leadership as the IETF evolves, and there 
may be a role for ISOC in this context. 

     o IANA support

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is currently housed 
within the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers 
(ICANN). Continued liaison with the IANA is also essential.  An open and 
professional relationship should be developed and maintained by the 
Executive Director so that problems may be identified and, hopefully, 
resolved quickly and efficiently. IETF activities have an operational 
impact that is carried out through coordination with the IANA and other 
organizations. It is likely that the IETF will want to establish 
relationships with providers of a wide variety of registry services, 
particularly if there is recognition of multiple root structures for the 
Internet. This should be a very important consideration if the Internet 
is to evolve and thrive going forward.

     o Funding for IETF 

While this point has not been discussed first in this memo, without 
funds, none of the above IETF activities are possible in any kind of 
professional manner. While, in the past, meeting fees have covered 
some of the IETF Secretariat costs, and, in recent years, the Internet 
Society has covered the RFC Editor expenses, new sources of funding 
need to be identified. A joint team should be appointed by the IETF 
Chair to determine the nature and scope of funding that may be required 
going forward. ISOC is one possible source for possible funding, if it 
can be provided at arms length. Other sources of revenue should also be 
identified, including CNRI, which has partially supported the IETF with 
internal funds over many years. The IETF should also be open in this 
context to collaborative efforts with other standards bodies to provide 
services in kind, if not actual funding. For example, the United 
Nations, including such specialized agencies as UNESCO or ITU, have 
excellent facilities that may be made available for IETF meetings at 
reasonable rates. There may also be situations where these and other 
organizations are exploring similar technical problems. Cooperative 
ventures to address and resolve new technical issues as they arise may 
prove beneficial, particularly where costs are shared.

     o Establishment of an IETF Foundation

Closely coupled with considerations of funding is the possible 
establishment of an IETF Foundation. The primary purpose of such an 
organization would be to coordinate the funding efforts for the IETF in 
light of the IETF's public interest mission in support of the Internet. 
The Foundation should be a non-profit organization with a Board of 
Directors drawn from prominent persons having roles that do not directly 
involve the IETF or its operations, but who are deeply committed to the 
progress and evolution of the Internet as a critical resource to support 
societal needs. For example, such a Foundation could be tasked with 
negotiating funding from various sources such as industry, foundations, 
governments, and others that wish to contribute. The Foundation would 
maintain a close liaison with the IETF, but would be an independent 
entity. Many other bodies rely on similar mechanisms to support their 
efforts. The existence of a Foundation should not, in any way, detract 
from the need for the IETF to have an effective Executive Director to 
oversee and coordinate the IETF's many activities. Once such a 
Foundation is established, the IETF leadership would be expected to 
provide the Foundation with its list of funding priorities and future 
plans.

3.  Conclusion

While there are no doubt many other aspects of the IETF administrative 
and technical structure that will arise in the course of the 
reorganization process, it is time to move ahead. CNRI has played a 
lead role for the past sixteen years in the organization and management 
of the IETF, including, in particular, the IETF Secretariat. Under the 
leadership of Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf, this role goes back even further, 
almost to  the origins of the Internet in the early 1970s. In recent 
months, the IETF leadership has brought to CNRI some of its concerns 
about how the current support structure is working out in practice. 
CNRI is currently addressing them, but effective solutions will require 
close interactions between the IETF leadership and CNRI. CNRI is 
committed to the success of this process.

CNRI has expressed its intention to continue to provide the IETF 
Secretariat for however long the transition to a new arrangement may 
take.  Foremost in the mind of CNRI, as it works with the IETF 
leadership in the coming year to evaluate the various proposals under 
consideration, is the importance of the IETF from a public interest 
perspective. Decisions adopted by the IETF have a substantial impact 
on the health and well being of the Internet, the community of users 
and suppliers of Internet equipment and services, as well as on the 
continued evolution of the Internet for the benefit of the public 
at large.  

Note from Author: The Author of this memo provided legal counsel to 
CNRI with respect to the IETF Secretariat functions from 1987 through 
1997. While the Author continues to provide legal advice and guidance to 
the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) on a variety 
of other legal matters, the thoughts expressed in this memo are those 
of the Author and do not necessarily represent the views of CNRI. By 
submitting this Internet-Draft, the Author should not be viewed as 
providing legal advice to the IETF, ISOC, members of the IETF, or other 
parties. It is being submitted as the Author's individual thoughts -- 
in the IETF spirit.
