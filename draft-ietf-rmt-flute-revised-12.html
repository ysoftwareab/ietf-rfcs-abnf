The specification builds on Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC), version 1 <a href="#ID.ALC-revised">[ID.ALC-revised]</a>, the base protocol designed for massively scalable multicast distribution. ALC defines transport of arbitrary binary objects. For file delivery applications mere transport of objects is not enough, however. The end systems need to know what the objects actually represent. This document specifies a technique called FLUTE - a mechanism for signaling and mapping the properties of files to concepts of ALC in a way that allows receivers to assign those parameters for received objects. Consequently, throughout this document the term 'file' relates to an 'object' as discussed in ALC. Although this specification frequently makes use of multicast addressing as an example, the techniques are similarly applicable for use with unicast addressing.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">This specification is structured as follows. Section 3 begins by defining the concept of the file delivery session. Following that it introduces the File Delivery Table that forms the core part of this specification. Further, it discusses multiplexing issues of transmission objects within a file delivery session. Section 4 describes the use of congestion control and channels with FLUTE. Section 5 defines how the Forward Error Correction (FEC) Object Transmission Information is to be delivered within a file delivery session. Section 6 defines the required parameters for describing file delivery sessions in a general case.  Section 7 outlines security considerations regarding file delivery with FLUTE. Last, there are two informative appendices. Appendix A describes an envisioned receiver operation for the receiver of the file delivery session. Readers who want to see a simple example of FLUTE in operation should refer to Appendix A right away.  Appendix B gives an example of a File Delivery Table.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.1.1.1.p.1">FLUTE is applicable to the delivery of large and small files to many hosts, using delivery sessions of several seconds or more. For instance, FLUTE could be used for the delivery of large software updates to many hosts simultaneously. It could also be used for continuous, but segmented, data such as time-lined text for subtitling - potentially leveraging its layering inheritance from ALC and LCT to scale the richness of the session to the congestion status of the network. It is also suitable for the basic transport of metadata, for example SDP <a href="#RFC.SDP">[RFC.SDP]</a> files which enable user applications to access multimedia sessions.</p>

These are the ALC protocol instantiation <a href="#ID.ALC-revised">[ID.ALC-revised]</a>, the Layered Coding Transport (LCT) Building Block <a href="#RFC5651">[RFC5651]</a> and the FEC Building Block <a href="#RFC5052">[RFC5052]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.3.p.2">FLUTE can be used with both multicast and unicast delivery, but it's primary application is for unidirectional multicast file delivery. FLUTE requires connectivity between a sender and receivers but does not require connectivity from receivers to a sender. FLUTE inherently works with all types of networks, including LANs, WANs, Intranets, the Internet, asymmetric networks, wireless networks, and satellite networks.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.3.p.3">FLUTE is compatible with both IPv4 or IPv6 as no part of the packet is IP version specific.

<p id="rfc.section.1.1.4.p.2">FLUTE can also be used for point-to-point (unicast) communications. At a minimum, implementations of ALC MUST support the Wave and Equation Based Rate Control (WEBRC) <a href="#RFC.3738">[RFC.3738]</a> multiple rate congestion control scheme <a href="#ID.ALC-revised">[ID.ALC-revised]</a>. However, since WEBRC has been designed for massively scalable multicast flows, it is not clear how appropriate it is to the particular case of unicast flows.

<p id="rfc.section.1.1.4.p.3">FLUTE provides reliability using the FEC building block. This will reduce the error rate as seen by applications.

<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">This specification is designed for the delivery of files. The core of this specification is to define how the properties of the files are carried in-band together with the delivered files.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">As an example, let us consider a 5200 byte file referred to by "http://www.example.com/docs/file.txt". Using the example, the following properties describe the properties that need to be conveyed by the file delivery protocol.</p>
<p></p>

<dl>

<dd style="margin-left: 8">Identifier of the file, expressed as a URI. The identifier MAY provide a location for the file. In the above example: "http://www.example.com/docs/file.txt".</dd>

<dt>*</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">File size, expressed in octets. In the above example: "5200". If the file is content encoded then this is the file size before content encoding.</dd>

<dd style="margin-left: 8">Content encoding of the file, within transport. In the above example, the file could be encoded using ZLIB <a href="#RFC.ZLIB">[RFC.ZLIB]</a>. In this case the size of the transmission object carrying the file would probably differ from the file size.  The transmission object size is delivered to receivers as part of the FLUTE protocol.</dd>
<dt>*</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Security properties of the file such as digital signatures, message digests, etc. For example, one could use S/MIME <a href="#RFC.SMIME">[RFC.SMIME]</a> as the content encoding type for files with this authentication wrapper, and one could use XML-DSIG <a href="#RFC.XML-DSIG">[RFC.XML-DSIG]</a> to digitally sign the file.

<p id="rfc.section.3.p.5">For each unique file, FLUTE encodes the attributes listed above and other attributes as children of an XML file element.

<h1 id="rfc.section.3.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.1">3.1.</a> <a href="#file-delivery-session" id="file-delivery-session">File delivery session</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">ALC is a protocol instantiation of Layered Coding Transport building block (LCT) <a href="#RFC.LCT">[RFC.LCT]</a>. Thus ALC inherits the session concept of LCT. In this document we will use the concept ALC/LCT session to collectively denote the interchangeable terms ALC session and LCT session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.2">An ALC/LCT session consists of a set of logically grouped ALC/LCT channels associated with a single sender sending ALC/LCT packets for one or more objects. An ALC/LCT channel is defined by the combination of a sender and an address associated with the channel by the sender. A receiver joins a channel to start receiving the data packets sent to the channel by the sender, and a receiver leaves a channel to stop receiving data packets from the channel.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.3">One of the fields carried in the ALC/LCT header is the Transport Session Identifier (TSI). The (source IP address, TSI) pair uniquely identifies a session.  Note that the TSI is scoped by the IP address, so the same TSI may be used by several source IP addresses at once.  Thus, the receiver uses the (source IP address, TSI) pair from each packet to uniquely identify the session sending each packet.  When a session carries multiple objects, the Transmission Object Identifier (TOI) field within the ALC/LCT header names the object used to generate each packet. Note that each object is associated with a unique TOI within the scope of a session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.4">A FLUTE session consistent with this specification MUST use FLUTE version 2 as specified in this document.  Thus, all sessions consistent with this specification MUST set the FLUTE version to 2. The FLUTE version is carried within the EXT_FDT extension header (defined in section 3.4.1) in the ALC/LCT layer.  A FLUTE session consistent with this specification MUST use ALC version 1 as specified in RFC 5775, and LCT version 1 as specified in RFC 5651.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.5">If multiple FLUTE sessions are sent to a channel then receivers MUST determine the FLUTE protocol version, based on version fields and the (source IP address, TSI) carried in the ALC/LCT header of the packet.  Note that when a receiver first begins receiving packets, it MAY NOT know the FLUTE protocol version, as not every LCT packet carries the EXT_FDT header (containing the FLUTE protocol version.) A new receiver MAY keep an open binding in the LCT protocol layer between the TSI and the FLUTE protocol version, until the EXT_FDT header arrives.  Alternately, a new receiver MAY discover a binding between TSI and FLUTE protocol version via a session discovery protocol that is out of scope in this document. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.6">If the sender is not assigned a permanent IP address accessible to receivers, then packets that can be received by receivers contain a temporary IP address.  In this case the TSI is scoped by this temporary IP address of the sender for the duration of the session. As an example, the sender may be behind a Network Address Translation (NAT) device that temporarily assigns an IP address for the sender.  In this case the TSI is scoped by the temporary IP address assigned by the NAT.  As another example, the sender may send its original packets using IPv6, but some portions of the network may not be IPv6 capable.  Thus, there may be an IPv6 to IPv4 translator that changes the IP address of the packets to a different IPv4 address. In this case, receivers in the IPv4 portion of the network will receive packets containing the IPv4 address, and thus the TSI for them is scoped by the IPv4 address. How the IP address of the sender to be used to scope the session by receivers is delivered to receivers, whether it is a permanent IP address or a temporary IP address, is outside the scope of this document.</p>

Each file description entry MUST include the TOI for the file that it describes and the URI identifying the file.

Each file description entry may also contain one or more descriptors that map the above-mentioned attributes to the file.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.6">Each file delivery session MUST have an FDT that is local to the given session. The FDT MUST provide a file description entry mapped to a TOI for each file appearing within the session. An object that is delivered within the ALC session, but not described in the FDT, other than the FDT itself, is not considered a 'file' belonging to the file delivery session. Handling of these unmapped TOIs (Non-zero TOIs that are not resolved by the FDT) is out of scope of this specification.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.7">Within the file delivery session the FDT is delivered as FDT Instances. An FDT Instance contains one or more file description entries of the FDT. Any FDT Instance can be equal to, a subset of, a superset of, overlap with or complement any other FDT Instance. A certain FDT Instance may be repeated multiple times during a session, even after subsequent FDT Instances (with higher FDT Instance ID numbers) have been transmitted.

<dt>*</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">It is RECOMMENDED that an FDT Instance that contains the file description entry for a file is sent at least once before sending the described file within a file delivery session.

<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.2">Generally, a receiver needs to receive an FDT Instance describing a file before it is able to recover the file itself. In this sense FDT Instances are of higher priority than files. Additionally, a FLUTE sender SHOULD assume receivers will not receive all packets pertaining to FDT Instances.  The way FDT Instances are transmitted has a large impact on satisfying the recommendation above. When there is a single file transmitted in the session, one way to satisfy the recommendation above is to repeatedly transmit on a regular enough basis FDT Instances describing the file while the file is being transmitted. If an FDT Instance is longer than one packet payload in length, it is RECOMMENDED that an FEC code that provides protection against loss be used for delivering this FDT Instance. When there are multiple files in a session concurrently being transmitted to receivers, the way the FDT Instances are structured and transmitted also has a large impact.  As an example, a way to satisfy the recommendation above is to transmit an FDT Instance that describes all files currently being transmitted, and to transmit this FDT Instance reliably, using the same techniques as explained for the case when there is a single file transmitted in a session. If instead the concurrently transmitted files are described in separate FDT Instances, another way to satisfy this recommendation is to transmit all the relevant FDT Instances reliably, using the same techniques as explained for the case when there is a single file transmitted in a session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.3">In any case, how often the description of a file is sent in an FDT Instance, how often an FDT Instance is sent, and how much FEC protection is provided for an FDT Instance (if longer than one packet payload) are dependent on the particular application and are outside the scope of this document.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.4">Sometimes the various attributes associated with files that are to be delivered within the file delivery session are sent out-of-band (rather than in-band, within one or several FDT Instances). The details of how this is done are out of the scope of this document.  However, it is still RECOMMENDED that any out-of-band transmission be managed in such a way that a receiver will be able to recover the attributes associated with a file with as much or greater reliability as the receiver is able to receive enough packets containing encoding symbols to recover the file. For example, the probability of a randomly chosen receiver being able to recover a given file can often be estimated based on a statistical model of reception conditions, the amount of data transmitted and the properties of any Forward Error Correction in use. The recommendation above suggests that mechanisms used for file attribute delivery should achieve higher a delivery probability than the file recovery probability.</p>

Senders SHOULD NOT re-use an FDT Instance ID value that is already in use for a non-expired FDT Instance. Sender behavior when all the FDT Instance IDs are used by non expired FEC Instances is outside the scope of this specification and left to individual implementations of FLUTE. Receipt of an FDT Instance that reuses an FDT Instance ID value that is currently used by a non expired FDT Instance SHOULD be considered as an error case.

<a href="#rfc.section.3.4.2">3.4.2.</a> <a href="#fdt-syntax" id="fdt-syntax">Syntax of FDT Instance</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.2.p.1">The FDT Instance contains file description entries that provide the mapping functionality described in 3.2 above.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.2.p.2">The FDT Instance is an XML structure that has a single root element "FDT-Instance". The "FDT-Instance" element MUST contain "Expires" attribute, which tells the expiration time of the FDT Instance. In addition, the "FDT-Instance" element MAY contain the "Complete" attribute (boolean), which, when TRUE, signals that this "FDT Instance" includes the set of "File" entries that exhausts both the set of files delivered so far and also the set of files to be delivered in the session. This implies that no new data will be provided in future FDT Instances within this session (i.e., that either FDT Instances with higher ID numbers will not be used or if they are used, will only provide identical file parameters to those already given in this and previous FDT Instances). The "Complete" attribute is therefore used to provide a complete list of files in an entire FLUTE session (a "complete FDT").</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.2.p.3">The "FDT-Instance" element MAY contain attributes that give common parameters for all files of an FDT Instance. These attributes MAY also be provided for individual files in the "File" element.  Where the same attribute appears in both the "FDT-Instance" and the "File" elements, the value of the attribute provided in the "File" element takes precedence.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.2.p.4">For each file to be declared in the given FDT Instance there is a single file description entry in the FDT Instance. Each entry is represented by element "File" which is a child element of the FDT Instance structure.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.2.p.5">The attributes of "File" element in the XML structure represent the attributes given to the file that is delivered in the file delivery session. The value of the XML attribute name corresponds to MIME field name and the XML attribute value corresponds to the value of the MIME field body. Each "File" element MUST contain at least two attributes "TOI" and "Content-Location". "TOI" MUST be assigned a valid TOI value as described in section 3.3 above.  "Content-Location" MUST be assigned a valid URI as defined in <a href="#RFC.HTTP11">[RFC.HTTP11]</a> which identifies the object to be delivered, for example a URI with the "http" or "file" URI scheme.  The semantics for any two "File" elements declaring the same "Content-Location" but differing "TOI" is that the element appearing in the FDT Instance with the greater FDT Instance ID is considered to declare newer instance (e.g. version) of the same "File".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.2.p.6">In addition to mandatory attributes, the "FDT-Instance" element and the "File" element MAY contain other attributes of which the following are specifically pointed out.  </p>

<dt>*</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The attribute "Content-Type" SHOULD be included and, when present, MUST be used for the purpose defined in <a href="#RFC.HTTP11">[RFC.HTTP11]</a>.</dd>
<dt>*</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Where the length is described, the attribute "Content-Length" MUST be used for the purpose as defined in <a href="#RFC.HTTP11">[RFC.HTTP11]</a>. The transfer length is defined to be the length of the object transported in octets. It is often important to convey the transfer length to receivers, because the source block structure needs to be known for the FEC decoder to be applied to recover source blocks of the file, and the transfer length is often needed to properly determine the source block structure of the file. There generally will be a difference between the length of the original file and the transfer length if content encoding is applied to the file before transport, and thus the "Content-Encoding" attribute is used. If the file is not content encoded before transport (and thus the "Content-Encoding" attribute is not used) then the transfer length is the length of the original file, and in this case the "Content-Length" is also the transfer length. However, if the file is content encoded before transport (and thus the "Content-Encoding" attribute is used), e.g., if compression is applied before transport to reduce the number of octets that need to be transferred, then the transfer length is generally different than the length of the original file, and in this case the attribute "Transfer-Length" MAY be used to carry the transfer length.</dd>

<dd style="margin-left: 8">Whenever content encoding is applied the attribute "Content-Encoding" MUST be included. Whenever the attribute "Content-Encoding" is included it MUST be used as described in <a href="#RFC.HTTP11">[RFC.HTTP11]</a>.</dd>

This encryption can be done over the whole file i.e. before applying FEC protection (e.g., by the content provider, before submitting the file to FLUTE), or be done on a packet per packet basis (e.g., when IPsec/ESP is used <a href="#RFC.4303">[RFC.4303]</a>, see <a href="#min-sec-recommendations">Section 7.5</a>).

<p id="rfc.section.7.2.2.p.1">Protection against corruptions (e.g., if an attacker sends forged packets) is achieved by means of a content integrity verification/sender authentication scheme. This service can be provided at the file level i.e. before applying content encoding and forward error correction encoding. In that case a receiver has no way to identify which symbol(s) is(are) corrupted if the file is detected as corrupted. This service can also be provided at the packet level i.e. after applying content encoding and forward error correction encoding, on a packet by packet basis. In this case, after removing all corrupted packets, the file may be in some cases recovered from the remaining correct packets.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.2.p.2">Integrity protection applied at the file level has the advantage of lower overhead since only relatively few bits are added to provide the integrity protection compared to the file size. However it has the disadvantage that it cannot distinguish between correct packets and corrupt packets and therefore correct packets, which may form the majority of packets received, may be unusable. Integrity protection applied at the packet level has the advantage that it can distinguish between correct and corrupt packets at the cost of additional per packet overhead.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.2.p.3">Several techniques can provide this source authentication/content integrity service: </p>

<dl>
<dt>*</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">at the file level, the file MAY be digitally signed, for instance by using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 <a href="#RFC.3447">[RFC.3447]</a>. This signature enables a receiver to check the file integrity, once this latter has been fully decoded. Even if digital signatures are computationally expensive, this calculation occurs only once per file, which is usually acceptable;</dd>
<dt>*</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">at the packet level, each packet can be digitally signed <a href="#RMT-SIMPLE-AUTH">[RMT-SIMPLE-AUTH]</a>. A major limitation is the high computational and transmission overheads that this solution requires. To avoid this problem, the signature may span a set of symbols (instead of a single one) in order to amortize the signature calculation, but if a single symbol is missing, the integrity of the whole set cannot be checked;</dd>
<dt>*</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">at the packet level, a Group Message Authentication Code (MAC) <a href="#RFC.2104">[RFC.2104]</a><a href="#RMT-SIMPLE-AUTH">[RMT-SIMPLE-AUTH]</a> scheme can be used, for instance by using HMAC-SHA-256 with a secret key shared by all the group members, senders and receivers. This technique creates a cryptographically secured digest of a packet that is sent along with the packet. The Group MAC scheme does not create prohibitive processing load nor transmission overhead, but it has a major limitation: it only provides a group authentication/integrity service since all group members share the same secret group key, which means that each member can send a forged packet. It is therefore restricted to situations where group members are fully trusted (or in association with another technique as a pre-check);</dd>
<dt>*</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">at the packet level, TESLA <a href="#RFC.4082">[RFC.4082]</a><a href="#MSEC-TESLA">[MSEC-TESLA]</a> is an attractive solution that is robust to losses, provides a true authentication/integrity service, and does not create any prohibitive processing load or transmission overhead. Yet checking a packet requires a small delay (a second or more) after its reception;</dd>
<dt>*</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">at the packet level, IPsec/ESP <a href="#RFC.4303">[RFC.4303]</a> can be used to check the integrity and authenticate the sender of all the packets being exchanged in a session (see <a href="#min-sec-recommendations">Section 7.5</a>).</dd>
</dl>

<p> Techniques relying on public key cryptography (digital signatures and TESLA during the bootstrap process, when used) require that public keys be securely associated to the entities.  This can be achieved by a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), or by a PGP Web of Trust, or by pre-distributing the public keys of each group member.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.2.p.4">Techniques relying on symmetric key cryptography (Group MAC) require that a secret key be shared by all group members.

<p id="rfc.section.7.2.2.p.5">It is up to the developer and deployer, who know the security requirements and features of the target application area, to define which solution is the most appropriate.

<a href="#rfc.section.7.3.1">7.3.1.</a> <a href="#sec-attacks-sdp" id="sec-attacks-sdp">Attacks against the Session Description</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.1.p.1">A FLUTE receiver may potentially obtain an incorrect Session Description for the session. The consequence of this is that legitimate receivers with the wrong Session Description are unable to correctly receive the session content, or that receivers inadvertently try to receive at a much higher rate than they are capable of, thereby possibly disrupting other traffic in the network.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.1.p.2">To avoid these problems, it is RECOMMENDED that measures be taken to prevent receivers from accepting incorrect Session Descriptions.  One such measure is source authentication to ensure that receivers only accept legitimate Session Descriptions from authorized senders.  How these measures are achieved is outside the scope of this document since this session description is usually carried out-of-band.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.3.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.3.2">7.3.2.</a> <a href="#sec-attacks-fdt" id="sec-attacks-fdt">Attacks against the FDT Instances</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.2.p.1">Corrupting the FDT Instances is one way to create a Denial of Service attack. For example, the attacker changes the MD5 sum associated to a file. This possibly leads a receiver to reject the files received, no matter whether the files have been correctly received or not.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.2.p.2">Corrupting the FDT Instances is also a way to make the reception process more costly than it should be. This can be achieved by changing the FEC Object Transmission Information when the FEC Object Transmission Information is included in the FDT Instance. For example, an attacker may corrupt the FDT Instance in such a way that Reed-Solomon over GF(2^^16) be used instead of GF(2^^8) with FEC Encoding ID 2. This may significantly increase the processing load while compromising FEC decoding.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.2.p.3">It is therefore RECOMMENDED that measures be taken to guarantee the integrity and to check the sender's identity of the FDT Instances. To that purpose, one of the counter-measures mentioned above (<a href="#sec-file-corruption">Section 7.2.2</a>) SHOULD be used.  These measures will either be applied on a packet level, or globally over the whole FDT Instance object. Additionally, XML digital signatures <a href="#RFC.XML-DSIG">[RFC.XML-DSIG]</a> are a way to protect the FDT Instance by digitally signing it. When there is no packet level integrity verification scheme, it is RECOMMENDED to rely on XML digital signatures of the FDT Instances.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.7.3.3">7.3.3.</a> <a href="#sec-attacks-alc" id="sec-attacks-alc">Attacks against the ALC/LCT parameters</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.3.p.1">By corrupting the ALC/LCT header (or header extensions) one can execute attacks on underlying ALC/LCT implementation. For example, sending forged ALC packets with the Close Session flag (A) set to one can lead the receiver to prematurely close the session.  Similarly, sending forged ALC packets with the Close Object flag (B) set to one can lead the receiver to prematurely give up the reception of an object.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.3.p.2">It is therefore RECOMMENDED that measures be taken to guarantee the integrity and to check the sender's identity of the ALC packets received. To that purpose, one of the counter-measures mentioned above (<a href="#sec-file-corruption">Section 7.2.2</a>) SHOULD be used.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.7.3.4">7.3.4.</a> <a href="#sec-attacks-bb" id="sec-attacks-bb">Attacks against the associated Building Blocks</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.4.p.1">Let us first focus on the congestion control building block, that may be used in the ALC session. A receiver with an incorrect or corrupted implementation of the multiple rate congestion control building block may affect the health of the network in the path between the sender and the receiver. That may also affect the reception rates of other receivers who joined the session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.4.p.2">When congestion control building block is applied with FLUTE, it is therefore RECOMMENDED that receivers be required to identify themselves as legitimate before they receive the Session Description needed to join the session. How receivers identify themselves as legitimate is outside the scope of this document. If authenticating a receiver does not prevent this latter to launch an attack, it will enable the network operator to identify him and to take counter-measures.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.4.p.3">When congestion control building block is applied with FLUTE, it is also RECOMMENDED that a packet level authentication scheme be used, as explained in <a href="#sec-file-corruption">Section 7.2.2</a>.  Some of them, like TESLA, only provide a delayed authentication service, whereas congestion control requires a rapid reaction. It is therefore RECOMMENDED <a href="#ID.ALC-revised">[ID.ALC-revised]</a> that a receiver using TESLA quickly reduces its subscription level when the receiver believes that a congestion did occur, even if the packet has not yet been authenticated. Therefore TESLA will not prevent DoS attacks where an attacker makes the receiver believe that a congestion occurred. This is an issue for the receiver, but this will not compromise the network. Other authentication methods that do not feature this delayed authentication could be preferred, or a group MAC scheme could be used in parallel to TESLA to prevent attacks launched from outside of the group.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.1">Lastly, we note that the security considerations that apply to, and are described in, ALC <a href="#ID.ALC-revised">[ID.ALC-revised]</a>, LCT <a href="#RFC.LCT">[RFC.LCT]</a> and FEC <a href="#RFC5052">[RFC5052]</a> also apply to FLUTE as FLUTE builds on those specifications. In addition, any security considerations that apply to any congestion control building block used in conjunction with FLUTE also apply to FLUTE.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.5">7.5.</a> <a href="#min-sec-recommendations" id="min-sec-recommendations">Minimum Security Recommendations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.5.p.1">We now introduce a mandatory to implement but not necessarily to use security configuration, in the sense of <a href="#RFC.3365">[RFC.3365]</a>. Since FLUTE relies on ALC/LCT, it inherits the "baseline secure ALC operation" of <a href="#ID.ALC-revised">[ID.ALC-revised]</a>. More precisely, security is achieved by means of IPsec/ESP in transport mode. <a href="#RFC.4303">[RFC.4303]</a> explains that ESP can be used to potentially provide confidentiality, data origin authentication, content integrity, anti-replay and (limited) traffic flow confidentiality.  <a href="#ID.ALC-revised">[ID.ALC-revised]</a> specifies that the data origin authentication, content integrity and anti-replay services SHALL be supported, and that the confidentiality service is RECOMMENDED. If a short lived session MAY rely on manual keying, it is also RECOMMENDED that an automated key management scheme be used, especially in case of long lived sessions.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.5.p.2">Therefore, the RECOMMENDED solution for FLUTE provides per-packet security, with data origin authentication, integrity verification and anti-replay. This is sufficient to prevent most of the in-band attacks listed above. If confidentiality is required, a per-packet encryption SHOULD also be used.</p>

</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.section.11.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.11.1">11.1.</a> RFC3926 to draft-ietf-rmt-flute-revised-12</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.1">Incremented FLUTE protocol version from 1 to 2, due to IESG concerns about backwards compatibility.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.2">Updated dependencies to other RFCs to revised versions, e.g., changed ALC reference from RFC 3450 to RFC 5775, changed LCT reference from RFC 3451 to RFC 5651, etc.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.3">Two additional items are added in the IANA considerations section, specifically the registration of two values in the LCT Header Extension Types registry (192 for EXT_FDT and 193 for EXT_CENC).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.4">Added clarification for the use of FLUTE for unicast communications in <a href="#weaknesses">Section 1.1.4</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.5">Clarified how to reliably deliver the FDT in <a href="#fdt-dynamics">Section 3.3</a> and the possibility of using an out-of-band delivery of FDT information.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.6">Clarified how to address FDT Instance expiration time wraparound with the notion of "epoch" of NTPv4 in <a href="#fdt-dynamics">Section 3.3</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.7">Clarified what should be considered as erroneous situations in <a href="#ext-fdt">Section 3.4.1</a> (definition of FDT Instance ID). In particular a receiver MUST be ready to handle FDT Instance ID wraparounds and missing FDT Instances.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.8">Updated the security section to define IPsec/ESP as a mandatory to implement security solution in <a href="#min-sec-recommendations">Section 7.5</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.9">Removed the 'Statement of Intent' from the <a href="#intro">Section 1</a>. The statement of intent was meant to clarify the "Experimental" status of RFC3926. It does not apply to this draft that is intended for "Standard Track" submission.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.10">Added clarification on XML-DSIG in the end of <a href="#file-delivery">Section 3</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.11">Revised the use of word "complete" in the <a href="#fdt">Section 3.2</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.12">Clarified <a href="#overall-flute-packet">Figure 1</a> WRT "Encoding Symbol(s) for FDT Instance".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.13">Clarified the FDT Instance ID wrap-around in the end of <a href="#ext-fdt">Section 3.4.1</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.14">Clarification for "Complete FDT" in the <a href="#fdt-syntax">Section 3.4.2</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.15">Added semantics for the case two TOIs refer to same Content-Location. Now it is in line how 3GPP and DVB interpret the case.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.16">In the <a href="#fdt-syntax">Section 3.4.2</a> XML Schema of FDT instance is modified to various advices. For example, extension by element was missing but is now supported. Also namespace definition is changed to URN format.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.17">Clarified FDT-schema extensibility in the end of <a href="#fdt-syntax">Section 3.4.2</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.18">The CENC value allocation is added in the end of <a href="#fdt-encoding">Section 3.4.3</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#deliv-fec-oti">Section 5</a> is modified so that EXT_FTI and the FEC issues are replaced by a reference to LCT specification.  We count on revised LCT specification to specify the EXT_FTI.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.20">Added a clarifying paragraph on the use of Codepoint in the very end of <a href="#deliv-fec-oti">Section 5</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.21">Reworked <a href="#iana-cons">Section 8</a> - IANA Considerations.  Now it contains three IANA registration requests: </p>

<dl>
<dt>*</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Registration Request for XML Schema of FDT Instance (urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:fdt)</dd>

<dt>*</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Content Encoding Algorithm Registration Request (ietf:rmt:cenc)</dd>
</dl>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.22">Added <a href="#contributors">Section 10</a> - Contributors.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.23">Revised list of both Normative as well as Informative references.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.24">Added a clarification that receiver should ignore reserved bits of Header Extension type 193 upon reception.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.25">Minor  changes to remove forward references (use before definition) or refer to forward reference sections.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.26">Elaborate on just what kind of networks cannot support FLUTE congestion control (1.1.4)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.27">In <a href="#fdt">Section 3.2</a> revise "several" (meaning 3-n vs. "couple" = 2) to "multiple" (meaning 2-n)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.28">Move <a href="#fdt-dynamics">Section 3.3</a> requirement to send FDT more reliably than files, to a bulleted RECOMMENDED requirement, making check-off easier for testers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.29">Sharpen <a href="#fdt-dynamics">Section 3.3</a> definition that future FDT file instances can "augment" (meaning enhance) rather than "complement" (sometimes meaning negate, which is not allowed) the file parameters.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.30">Elaborate in <a href="#fdt-dynamics">Section 3.3</a> and <a href="#channels-cc-timing">Section 4</a> that FEC Encoding ID = 0 is Compact No-code FEC, so that the reader doesn't have to search other RFCs to understand these protocol constants used by FLUTE.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.31">Require in <a href="#fdt-dynamics">Section 3.3</a> that FLUTE receivers SHALL NOT attempt to decode FDTs if they do not understand the FEC Encoding ID</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.32">Remove restriction of <a href="#fdt-dynamics">Section 3.3</a> in bullet #4 that TOI=0 for the FDT, to be consistent with Appendix, bullet 6, and elsewhere.  An FDT is signaled by an FDT Instance ID, NOT only by TOI = 0.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.33">Standardize on the term "expiration time" and avoid using the redundant but possibly confusing term "expiry time".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.34">To interwork with experimental flute, stipulate in <a href="#file-delivery-session">Section 3.1</a> that only 1 instantiation of all 3 protocols FLUTE, ALC, and LCT, can be associated with a session (source IP-Address, TSI) and mention in <a href="#desc-file-delivery-session">Section 6</a> that you may (optionally) derive the FLUTE version from the file delivery session description.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.35">Use a software writing tool to lower reading grade level and simplify <a href="#file-delivery-session">Section 3.1</a>.</p>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A">Appendix A.</a> Receiver operation (informative)</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.p.1">This section gives an example how the receiver of the file delivery session may operate. Instead of a detailed state-by-state specification the following should be interpreted as a rough sequence of an envisioned file delivery receiver. </p>

<dl>
<dt>1 .</dt>
<dd>The receiver obtains the description of the file delivery session identified by the pair: (source IP address, Transport Session Identifier). The receiver also obtains the destination IP addresses and respective ports associated with the file delivery session.</dd>
<dt>2 .</dt>
<dd>The receiver joins the channels in order to receive packets associated with the file delivery session. The receiver may schedule this join operation utilizing the timing information contained in a possible description of the file delivery session.</dd>
<dt>3 .</dt>
<dd>The receiver receives ALC/LCT packets associated with the file delivery session. The receiver checks that the packets match the declared Transport Session Identifier. If not, packets are silently discarded.</dd>
<dt>4 .</dt>
<dd>While receiving, the receiver demultiplexes packets based on their TOI and stores the relevant packet information in an appropriate area for recovery of the corresponding file. Multiple files can be reconstructed concurrently.</dd>
<dt>5 .</dt>
<dd>Receiver recovers an object. An object can be recovered when an appropriate set of packets containing Encoding Symbols for the transmission object have been received. An appropriate set of packets is dependent on the properties of the FEC Encoding ID and FEC Instance ID, and on other information contained in the FEC Object Transmission Information.</dd>
<dt>6 .</dt>
<dd>Objects with TOI = 0 are reserved for FDT Instances.  All FDT Instances are signaled by including an EXT_FDT header extension in the LCT header. The  EXT_FDT header contains an FDT Instance ID (i.e. an FDT version number.) If the object has an FDT Instance ID 'N', the receiver parses the payload of the instance 'N' of FDT and updates its FDT database accordingly.</dd>
<dt>7 .</dt>
<dd>If the object recovered is not an FDT Instance but a file, the receiver looks up its FDT database to get the properties described in the database, and assigns the file the given properties. The receiver also checks that the received content length matches with the description in the database. Optionally, if MD5 checksum has been used, the receiver checks that the calculated MD5 matches the description in the FDT database.</dd>
<dt>8 .</dt>
<dd>The actions the receiver takes with imperfectly received files (missing data, mismatching digestive, etc.) is outside the scope of this specification. When a file is recovered before the associated file description entry is available, a possible behavior is to wait until an FDT Instance is received that includes the missing properties.</dd>
<dt>9 .</dt>
<dd>If the file delivery session end time has not been reached go back to 3. Otherwise end.</dd>
