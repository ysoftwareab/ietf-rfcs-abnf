Internet-Draft             WSON YANG Model                    July 2015


1. Introduction

   This document provides a YANG data model for the routing and
   wavelength assignment (RWA) Traffic Engineering (TE) topology in
   wavelength switched optical networks (WSONs). The YANG model
   described in this document is a WSON technology-specific Yang model
   based on the information model developed in [RFC7446] and the two
   encoding drafts [WSON-Encode] and [Gen-Encode] that developed
   protocol independent encodings based on [RFC7446]. This document
   augments the generic TE topology draft [TE-TOPO].

   What is not in scope of this document is both impairment-aware WSON
   and flex-grid.


2. Routing and Wavelength Assignment Informational Model

   The relevant information model in this document comprises

     - Connectivity Matrix Model (Section 2.1)
     - Resource Pool Model (Section 2.2)
     - Port Wavelength Restriction (Section 2.3)
     - Wavelength Availability on Links (Section 2.4)

   [Editor's Note: This version covers the corresponding YANG data
   model for the first two sections (Sections 2.1 and 2.2) and leaves
   the YANG model for Sections 2.3 and 2.4 in the later version.]

   Sections 2.1 - 2.4 rehashes key information models from [RWA-Info]
   to facilitate the development of the YANG model (Section 3).

2.1. Connectivity Matrix Model

   The connectivity matrix (ConnectivityMatrix) represents either the
   potential connectivity matrix for asymmetric switches (e.g. ROADMs
   and such) or fixed connectivity for an asymmetric device such as a
   multiplexer.

   Note that multiple connectivity matrices are allowed and the Node_ID
   would be an appropriate identifier for the node to point the
   Connectivity matrix within the WSON RWA context.

   <Node_Information> ::= <Node_ID> [<ConnectivityMatrix>...]

   <ConnectivityMatrix> ::= <MatrixID>

                            <ConnType>

Internet-Draft             WSON YANG Model                    July 2015


                            <Matrix>

   Where

   <MatrixID> is a unique identifier for the matrix.

   <ConnType> can be either 0 or 1 depending upon whether the
   connectivity is either fixed or switched.

   <Matrix> represents the fixed or switched connectivity in that
   Matrix(i, j) = 0 or 1 depending on whether input port i can connect
   to output port j for one or more wavelengths.



2.2. Resource Pool Model

   A WSON node may include regenerators or wavelength converters
   arranged in a shared pool. As discussed in [RFC6163] this can
   include Optical-Electronic-Optical (OEO) based Wavelength Division
   Multiplexing (WDM) switches as well. There are a number of different
   approaches used in the design of WDM switches containing regenerator
   or converter pools. However, from the point of view of path
   computation the following need to be known:

   1. The nodes that support regeneration or wavelength conversion.

   2. The accessibility and availability of a wavelength converter to
      convert from a given input wavelength on a particular input port
      to a desired output wavelength on a particular output port.

   3. Limitations on the types of signals that can be converted and the
      conversions that can be performed.



   The following Figures show resource pool architecture of WSON.

            Figure 1 Schematic diagram of resource pool model.



   Since resources tend to be packaged together in blocks of similar
   devices, e.g., on line cards or other types of modules, the
   fundamental unit of identifiable resource in this document is the
   "resource block". A resource block may contain one or more
   resources. A resource is the smallest identifiable unit of
   processing allocation. One can group together resources into blocks
   if they have similar characteristics relevant to the optical system
   being modeled, e.g., processing properties, accessibility, etc.

   This leads to the following formal high level model:

   <Node_Information> ::= <Node_ID>

   Note that these additional link characteristics only applies to line
   side ports of WDM system or add/drop ports pertaining to Resource
   Pool (e.g., Regenerator or Wavelength Converter Pool). The
   advertisement of input/output tributary ports is not intended here.

   Where

   MatrixID is the ID of the corresponding connectivity matrix.

     LabelSet is a conceptual set of labels (wavelengths).

     MaxNumChannels is the maximum number of channels that can be
     simultaneously used (relative to either a port or a matrix).

     LinkSet is a conceptual set of ports.

2.4. Wavelength Availability on Links

   In the previously presented information model there are a limited
   number of information elements that are dynamic, i.e., subject to
   change with subsequent establishment and teardown of connections.
   Depending on the protocol used to convey this overall information
   model it may be possible to send this dynamic information separate
   from the relatively larger amount of static information needed to
   characterize WSON's and their network elements.

   <DynamicLinkInfo> ::=  <LinkID>

                          <AvailableLabels>

                          [<SharedBackupLabels>]

   AvailableLabels is a set of labels (wavelengths) currently available
   on the link. Given this information and the port wavelength
   restrictions one can also determine which wavelengths are currently
   in use. This parameter could potential be used with other
   technologies that GMPLS currently covers or may cover in the future.

   SharedBackupLabels is a set of labels (wavelengths) currently used
   for shared backup protection on the link. An example usage of this
   information in a WSON setting is given in [Shared]. This parameter
   could potential be used with other technologies that GMPLS currently
   covers or may cover in the future.
