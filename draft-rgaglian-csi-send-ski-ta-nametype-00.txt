Abstract

   SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) Utilizes X.509v3 certificates for
   performing router authorization.  This document specifies a SEND name
   type to identify trust anchor X.509v3 certificates based on its
   Subject Key Identifier.

2.  Introduction

   SEcure Neighbor Discovery [RFC3971] (SEND) utilizes X.509v3
   certificates that include [RFC3779] extension for IPv6 addresses to
   certify a router authority over an IPv6 prefix for NDP (Neighbor
   Discovery Protocol).  The Tust Anchor Option in section 6.4.3 of RFC
   3971 allows the identification of the trust anchor selected by the
   host.  In that section, two name types were defined, the DER Encoded
   X.501 Name and a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).

   In any Public Key Infraestructure, the subject name of a certificate
   is only unique for each CA.  A new option to identify trust anchors
   accross CAs is needed.

   In [draft-ietf-csi-send-cert-01] the certificate profile described in
   [draft-ietf-sidr-res-certs-17] is selected for SEND.  In these
   documents, the Subject field the certificates are declared to be
   meaningless and the subjectAltName field is not allowed.  On the
   other hand, the Subject Key Identifier (SKI) extension for the X.509
   certificates is defined as mandatory and non-critical.

   This document specifies a new option for SEND that allows to use of
   the SKI X.509 extension to identify trust anchor material as
   described in section X.X of RFC 3971.

3.  SEND SKI trust anchor identifier option

   Name Type

   TBD SHA-1 Subject Key Identifier (SKI)

   The Key Identifier used here is the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the value
   of the DER-encoded ASN.1 bit string of the subject public key, as
   described in Section 4.2.1.2 of [RFC5280].

3.1.  Processing Rules for Router

   As described in RFC 3971, The anchor is identified by the Trust
   Anchor option.  If the Trust Anchor option is represented as a SHA-1
   SKI, then the SKI must be equal to the SKI in the anchor's
   certificate calculated as described in
   [draft-ietf-sidr-res-certs-17].  The router SHOULD include the Trust
   Anchor option(s) in the advertisement for which the certification
   path was found.

   If the router is unable to find a path to the requested anchor, it
   SHOULD send an advertisement without any certificates.  In this case,
   the router SHOULD include the Trust Anchor options that were
   solicited.
