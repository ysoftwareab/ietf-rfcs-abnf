<p>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are frequently used for large-scale content delivery. As a result, existing CDN providers are scaling up their infrastructure and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are deploying their own CDNs. There is a requirement for interconnecting standalone CDNs so that their collective CDN footprint can be leveraged for the end-to-end delivery of content from Content Service Providers (CSPs) to end users. The Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) working group has been chartered to develop an interoperable and scalable solution for such CDN interconnection.</p>
<p>The goal of the present document is to outline the requirements for the solution and interfaces to be specified by the CDNI working group.  This draft is a work in progress and requirements may be added, modified, or removed by the working group. </p>
<h1><a>Requirements Language</a></h1>
<p>The key words "High Priority", "Medium Priority" and "Low Priority" in this document are to be interpreted in the following way:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>"High Priority" indicates requirements that are to be supported by the CDNI interfaces. A requirement is stated as "High Priority" when it is established by the working group that it can be met without compromising the targeted schedule for WG deliverables, or when it is established that specifying a solution without meeting this requirement would not make sense and would justify re-adjusting the WG schedule, or both. This is tagged as "[HIGH]".</li>
<li>"Medium Priority" indicates requirements that are to be supported by the CDNI interfaces unless the WG realizes at a later stage that attempting to meet this requirement would compromise the overall WG schedule (for example it would involve complexities that would result in significantly delaying the deliverables). This is tagged as "[MED]".</li>
<li>"Low Priority" indicates requirements that are to be supported by the CDNI interfaces provided that dedicating WG resources to this work does not prevent addressing "High Priority" and "Medium Priority" requirements and that attempting to meet this requirement would not compromise the overall WG schedule. This is tagged as "[LOW]".</li>
</ul>

<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The volume of video and multimedia content delivered over the Internet is rapidly increasing and expected to continue doing so in the future. In the face of this growth, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) provide numerous benefits: reduced delivery cost for cacheable content, improved quality of experience for end users, and increased robustness of delivery. For these reasons CDNs are frequently used for large-scale content delivery. As a result, existing CDN providers are scaling up their infrastructure and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are deploying their own CDNs. It is generally desirable that a given content item can be delivered to an End User regardless of that End User's location or attachment network. However, the footprint of a given CDN in charge of delivering a given content may not expand close enough to the End User's current location or attachment network to realize the cost benefit and user experience that a more distributed CDN would provide.  This creates a requirement for interconnecting standalone CDNs so that their collective CDN footprint can be leveraged for the end-to-end delivery of content from Content Service Providers (CSPs) to End Users.  The Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) working group has been chartered to develop an interoperable and scalable solution for such CDN interconnection.</p>
<p><a href="#I-D.jenkins-cdni-problem-statement">[I-D.jenkins-cdni-problem-statement]</a> outlines the problem area that the CDNI working group is chartered to address.  <a href="#I-D.bertrand-cdni-use-cases">[I-D.bertrand-cdni-use-cases]</a> discusses the use cases for CDN Interconnection. <a href="#I-D.davie-cdni-framework">[I-D.davie-cdni-framework]</a> discusses the technology framework for the CDNI solution and interfaces.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">The goal of the present document is to document the requirements for the CDNI solution and interfaces. In order to meet the timelines defined in the working group charter, the present document categorizes the CDNI requirements as "High Priority", "Medium Priority", and "Low Priority". (OPEN ISSUE: Should requirements in each section be ordered by priority?)</p>

<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI solution shall not require a change, or an upgrade, to the Content Service Provider to benefit from content delivery through interconnected CDNs.</dd>
<dt>GEN-18 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI solution shall not require intra-CDN information to be exposed to other CDNs for effective and efficient delivery of the content. Examples of intra-CDN information include surrogate topology, surrogate status, cached content, etc.</dd>
<dt>GEN-19 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI solution shall support delivery to the user agent based on HTTP <a href="#RFC2616">[RFC2616]</a>. (Note that while delivery and acquisition "data plane" protocols are out of the CDNI solution scope, the CDNI solution "control plane" protocols are expected to participate in enabling, selecting or facilitating operations of such acquisition and delivery protocols. Hence it is useful to state requirements on the CDNI solution in terms of which acquisition and delivery protocols).</dd>
<dt>GEN-20 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI solution shall support acquisition across CDNs based on HTTP <a href="#RFC2616">[RFC2616]</a>.</dd>
<dt>GEN-21 </dt>
<dd>[LOW] The CDNI solution may support delivery to the user agent based on protocols other than HTTP.</dd>

<dt>GEN-24 </dt>
<dd>[MED] The CDNI solution should support an arbitrary topology of interconnected CDNs (i.e. the CDN topology cannot be restricted to a tree, a loop-free topology, etc.).</dd>

<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI solution shall prevent looping of any CDNI information exchange.</dd>
<dt>GEN-26 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] When making use of third party reference, the CDNI solution shall consider the potential issues associated with the use of various format of third-party references (e.g. NAT or IPv4/IPv6 translation potentially breaking third-party references based on an IP addresses such as URI containing IPv4 or IPv6 address litterals, split DNS situations potentially breaking third-party references based on DNS fully qualified domain names) and wherever possible avoid, minimize or mitigate the associated risks based on the specifics of the environments where the reference is used (e.g. likely or unlikely presence of NAT in the path). In particular, this applies to situations where the CDNI solution needs to construct and convey uniform resource identifiers for directing/redirecting a content request, as well as to situations where the CDNI solution needs to pass on a third party reference (e.g. to identify a User Agent) in order to allow another entity to make a more informed decision (e.g. make a more informed request routing decision by attempting to derive location information from the third party reference).</dd>

<dd>[MED] The CDNI Control interface should support initiation and control by the Upstream CDN of pre-positioned content acquisition by the Downstream CDN.(OPEN ISSUE: how much influence the Upstream CDN ought to have on pre-positioning of the content on surrogates inside the Downstream CDN is TBD).</dd>
<dt>CNTL-16 </dt>
<dd>[LOW] The CDNI Control interface may allow a CDN to establish, update and terminate a CDN interconnection with another CDN whereby one CDN can act as a Downstream CDN for the other CDN (that acts as an Upstream CDN).</dd>

<dt>CNTL-18 </dt>
<dd>[LOW] The CDNI Control interface may allow bootstrapping of the Request-Routing interface. For example, this can potentially include:<ul>

<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">The main function of the Request Routing interface is to allow the Request-Routing systems in interconnected CDNs to communicate to facilitate redirection of the request across CDNs.</p>
<p></p>

<dl>
<dt>REQ-15 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI Control interface shall allow the Downstream CDN to communicate to the Upstream CDN coarse information about the Downstream CDN ability and/or willingness to handle requests from the Upstream CDN. For example, this could potentially include a binary signal ("Downstream CDN ready/not-ready to take additional requests from Upstream CDN&#8221;) to be used in case of excessive load or failure condition in the Downstream CDN. (OPEN ISSUE: Belong to Control Interface section?)</dd>
<dt>REQ-16 </dt>
<dd>[MED] The CDNI Request-Routing interface should allow the Downstream CDN to communicate to the Upstream CDN aggregate information to facilitate CDN selection during request routing, such as Downstream CDN capabilities, resources and affinities (i.e.  Preferences or cost). This information could, for example, include:<ul>
<li>supported content types and delivery protocols</li>
<li>footprint (e.g. layer-3 coverage)</li>
<li>a set of metrics/attributes (e.g. Streaming bandwidth, storage resources, distribution and delivery priority)</li>
<li>a set of affinities (e.g. Preferences, indication of distribution/delivery fees)</li>
<li>information to facilitate request redirection (e.g.  Reachability information of Downstream CDN Request Routing system).</li>
</ul>
<p>[Note: Some of this information - such as supported content types and delivery protocols- may also potentially be taken into account by the distribution system in the Upstream CDN for pre-positioning of content and/or metadata in the Downstream CDN in case of pre-positioned content acquisition and/or pre-positioned CDNI metadata acquisition.]</p>
</dd>
<dt>REQ-17 </dt>
<dd>[MED] In the case of cascaded redirection, the CDNI Request-Routing interface shall allow the Downstream CDN to also include in the information communicated to the Upstream CDN, information on the capabilities, resources and affinities of CDNs to which the Downstream CDN may (in turn) redirect requests received by the Upstream CDN. In that case, the CDNI Request-Routing interface shall prevent looping of such information exchange.</dd>
<dt>REQ-18 </dt>
<dd>[LOW] The CDNI Control interface may allow the Downstream CDN to communicate to the Upstream CDN aggregate information on CDNI administrative limits and policy. This information can be taken into account by the Upstream CDN Request Routing system in its CDN Selection decisions. This information could, for example, include:<ul>
<li>maximum number of requests redirected by the Upstream CDN to be served simultaneously by the Downstream CDN</li>
<li>maximum aggregate volume of content (e.g. in Terabytes) to be delivered by the Downstream CDN over a time period.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>REQ-19 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI Request-Routing architecture and interface shall support efficient request-routing for small objects. This may, for example, call for a mode of operation (e.g. DNS-based request routing) where freshness and accuracy of CDN/Surrogate selection can be traded-off against reduced request-routing load (e.g. Via lighter-weight queries and caching of request-routing decisions). (OPEN ISSUE: Surrogate selection is out of scope?)</dd>
<dt>REQ-20 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI Request-Routing architecture and interface shall support efficient request-routing for large objects. This may, for example, call for a mode of operation (e.g. HTTP-based request routing) where freshness and accuracy of CDN/Surrogate selection justifies a per-request decision and a per-request CDNI Request-Routing protocol call. (OPEN ISSUE: Surrogate selection is out of scope?)</dd>
<dt>REQ-21 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI Request-Routing architecture shall support recursive CDNI request routing.</dd>
<dt>REQ-22 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI Request-Routing architecture shall support iterative CDNI request routing.</dd>
<dt>REQ-23 </dt>
<dd>[MED] In case of detection of a request redirection loop, the CDNI Request-Routing loop prevention mechanism should allow routing of the request (as opposed to the request loop being simply interrupted without routing the request). (OPEN ISSUE: Why route a looped request?)</dd>
<dt>REQ-24 </dt>
<dd>[MED] The CDNI Request-Routing protocol should support a mechanism allowing enforcment of a limit on the number of successive CDN redirections for a given request.</dd>
<dt>REQ-25 </dt>
<dd>[LOW] The CDNI Request-Routing protocol may support a mechanism allowing an upstream CDN to avoid redirecting a request to a downstream CDN if that is likely to result in the total redirection time exceeding some limit.</dd>
<dt>REQ-26 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI Request-Routing protocol shall allow the Upstream CDN to include, in the query to the Downstream CDN, the necessary information to allow the Downstream CDN to process the redirection query. This could, for example, include:<ul>
<li>information from which the location of the user-agent that originated the request can be inferred (e.g. User Agent fully qualified domain name in case of HTTP-based Request Routing, DNS Proxy fully qualified domain name in case of DNS-based Request Routing)</li>
<li>requested resource information (e.g. Resource URI in case of HTTP-based Request Routing, Resource hostname in case of DNS-based Request Routing)</li>
<li>additional available request information (e.g. request headers in case of HTTP-based Request Routing).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>REQ-27 </dt>
<dd>[LOW] The CDNI Request-Routing protocol may also allow the Upstream CDN to convey information pointing to CDNI metadata applicable (individually or through inheritance) to the requested content.  For illustration, the CDNI metadata pointed to could potentially include metadata that is applicable to any content, metadata that is applicable to a content collection (to which the requested content belongs) and/or metadata that is applicable individually to the requested content.</dd>
<dt>REQ-28 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI Request-Routing interface shall allow the Downstream CDN to include the following information in the response to the Upstream CDN:<ul>
<li>status code, in particular indicating acceptance or rejection of request (e.g. Because the Downstream CDN is unwilling or unable to serve the request). In case of rejection, an error code is also to be provided, which allows the Upstream CDN to react appropriately (e.g. Select another Downstream CDN, or serve the request itself)</li>
<li>redirection information (e.g. Resource URI in case of HTTP-based Request Routing, equivalent of a DNS record in case of DNS-based Request Routing).</li>
</ul>

<dt>META-23 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] Whether in the pre-positioned content acquisition model or in the dynamic content acquisition model, the CDNI Metadata Distribution interface shall provide the necessary information to allow the Downstream CDN to acquire the content from an upstream source (e.g. Acquisition protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier in Upstream CDN- or rules to construct this URI).</dd>
<dt>META-24 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI metadata shall allow signaling of one or more upstream sources, where each upstream source can be in the Upstream CDN, in another CDN, the CSP origin server or any arbitrary source designated by the Upstream CDN. Note that some upstream sources (e.g. the content origin server) may or may not be willing to serve the content to the Downstream CDN, if this policy is known to the upstream CDN then it may omit those sources when exchanging CDNI metadata.</dd>

<dt>META-27 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI Metadata Distribution interface shall allow association of CDNI Metadata at the granularity of individual object. This is necessary to achieve fine-grain Metadata distribution at the level of an individual object when necessary.</dd>
<dt>META-28 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI Metadata Distribution interface shall allow association of CDNI Metadata at the granularity of an object set. This is necessary to achieve scalable distribution of metadata when a large number of objects share the same distribution policy.</dd>
<dt>META-29 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI Metadata Distribution interface shall support multiple levels of inheritance with precedence to more specific metadata.  For example, the CDNI Metadata Distribution protocol may support metadata that is applicable to any content, metadata that is applicable to a content collection and metadata that is applicable to an individual content where content level metadata overrides content collection metadata that overrides metadata for any content.</dd>
<dt>META-30 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI Metadata Distribution interface shall ensure that conflicting metadata with overlapping scope are prevented or deterministically handled.</dd>
<dt>META-31 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI Metadata Distribution interface shall provide indication by the Downstream CDN to the Upstream CDN of whether the CDNI metadata (and corresponding future request redirections) is accepted or rejected. When rejected, the CDNI Metadata Distribution protocol Must allow the Downstream CDN to provide information about the cause of the rejection.</dd>
<dt>META-32 </dt>

<li>geo-blocking information (i.e. Information defining geographical areas where the content is to be made available or blocked)</li>
<li>availability windows (i.e. Information defining time windows during which the content is to be made available or blocked; expiration time may also be included to remove content) (OPEN ISSUE: Expiration time needed?)</li>
<li>delegation whitelist/blacklist (i.e. Information defining which downstream CDNs the content may/may not be delivered through)</li>
</ul>

<dt>META-33 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI Metadata interface shall be able to exchange a set of well-accepted metadata elements with specified semantics (e.g. start of time window, end of time window).</dd>
<dt>META-34 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI Metadata interface shall allow exchange of opaque metadata element, whose semantic is not defined in CDNI but established by private CDN agreement.</dd>
<dt>META-35 </dt>
<dd>[HIGH] The CDNI Metadata Distribution interface shall allow signaling of authorization checks and validation that are to be performed by the surrogate before delivery. For example, this could potentially include:<ul><li>need to validate URI signed information (e.g. Expiry time, Client IP address).</li></ul>
</dd>
<dt>META-36 </dt>
<dd>[LOW] The CDNI Metadata Distribution interface may allow signaling of CDNI-relevant surrogate cache behavior parameters. For example, this could potentially include:<ul>
