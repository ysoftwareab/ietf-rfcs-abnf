1. Introduction 
    
   In OSPFv3 for IPv6, authentication fields have been removed from OSPF 
   headers. When running over IPv6, OSPF relies on the IPv6 
   Authentication Header (AH) and IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload 
   (ESP) to ensure integrity, authentication and/or confidentiality of 
   routing exchanges. 
    
   This document describes how IPv6 AH/ESP extension headers can be used 
   to provide authentication/confidentiality to OSPFv3. 
    
   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with OSPFv3 [1], AH [4], 
   ESP [3], the concept of security associations, tunnel and transport 
   mode of IPsec and the key management options available for AH and ESP 
   (manual keying and IKE) [2]. 
 
2. OSPFv2 to OSPFv3 
    
   Security concerns MUST be taken away from OSPFv3 protocol and IPv6 
   stack MUST provide inherent security to OSPFv3 by using AH/ESP 
   extension headers. It means OSPFv3 protocol MUST not receive any 
   unauthenticated packets. As OSPFv2 has its own security mechanisms, 
   no inherent security needs to be provided by the IPv4 stack. As 
   OSPFv2 is only for IPv4 and OSPFv3 is only for IPv6, the distinction 
   between the packets can be easily made by IP version. 
    
   Authentication and confidentiality, if provided, MUST be provided to 
   the entire OSPFv3 header and data. Authentication to the selected 
   portions of IPv6 header, selected portions of extension headers and 
   selected options may also be provided optionally. 
    
3. Authentication 
    
   Transport mode SA is the security association between two hosts or 
   security gateways that are acting as hosts. SA must be tunnel mode if 
   either end of the security association is a security gateway. OSPFv3 
   packets are exchanged between the routers but as the packets are 
   destined to the routers, the routers act like host in this case. So

   transport mode SA MUST be used in order to provide required security 
   to OSPFv3. 
 
   In order to support OSPFv3 authentication, "ESP with NULL encryption" 
   MUST be supported in transport mode. "AH" in transport mode SHOULD 
   also be provided. AH in transport mode provides authentication to 
   higher layer protocols, selected portions of IPv6 header, selected 
   portions of extension headers and selected options. ESP with NULL 
   encryption in transport mode will provide authentication to only 
   higher layer protocol data and not to the IPv6 header, extension 
   headers and options. 
    
   OSPF packets received in clear text and OSPF received with incorrect 
   AH ICV MUST be dropped when authentication is enabled. 
    
4. Confidentiality 
    
   Providing confidentiality to OSPFv3 in addition to authentication is 
   optional. Confidentiality must be implemented using ESP extension 
   header of IPv6 if it is being provided. ESP with non-null encryption 
   in transport mode MUST be used for the providing confidentiality to 
   OSPFv3.  
    
5. Authentication and Encryption Algorithms 
    
   hmac-md5-96 must be implemented as the authentication algorithm and 
   DES-CBC must be implemented as the encryption algorithm. 
    
6. Key Management 
    
   OSPFv3 exchanges both multicast and unicast packets. While running 
   OSPFv3 over a broadcast interface, the authentication/confidentiality 
   required is "one to many". Since IKE is based on the Diffie-Hellman 
   key agreement protocol and works only for two communicating parties, 
   it is not possible to use IKE for providing the required "one to 
   many" authentication/confidentiality. Manual keying MUST be used for 
   this purpose. In manual keying SAs are statically installed on the 
   routers and these static SAs are used to encrypt/authenticate the 
   data. 
    
   Since security associations (SAs) are directional, generally 
   different security associations are used for inbound and outbound 
   processing for providing higher security. The following figure 
   explains that it is not possible to use different security 
   associations for inbound and outbound processing in order to provide 
   the required "one to many" security.

       A                  | 
     SAa     ------------>| 
     SAb     <------------| 
                          | 
       B                  | 
     SAb     ------------>| 
     SAa     <------------| 
                          | 
       C                  | 
     SAa/SAb ------------>| 
     SAa/SAb <------------| 
                      Broadcast  
                       Network 
    
   If we consider communication between A and B in the above diagram, 
   everything seems to be fine. A uses security association SAa for 
   outgoing packets and B uses the same for incoming packets and vice 
   versa. Now if we include C in the group and C sends a packet out 
   using SAa then only A will be able to understand it or if C sends the 
   packets out using SAb then only B will be able to understand it. 
   Since the packets are multicast packets and they are going to be 
   processed by both A and B, there is no SA for C to use so that A and 
   B both can understand it. 
    
   The problem can be solved with the following figure where all of them 
   use the same SA for incoming and outgoing direction. 
    
      A                   | 
     SAs     ------------>| 
     SAs     <------------| 
                          | 
      B                   | 
     SAs     ------------>| 
     SAs     <------------| 
                          | 
      C                   | 
     SAs     ------------>| 
     SAs     <------------| 
                      Broadcast  
                       Network 
    
   So, all the adjacent routers on a broadcast medium MUST use the same 
   SA and the same SA MUST be used for inbound and outbound processing. 
 
7. SA Granularity and Selectors 
    
   The user SHOULD be given a choice to share the same SA among multiple 
   interfaces or using unique SA per interface.

8. Virtual Links 
    
   Different SA than the SA of underlying interface MUST be provided for 
   virtual links. Packets sent out on virtual links use unicast site 
   local or global IPv6 addresses as the IPv6 source address and all the 
   other packets use multicast and unicast link local addresses. This 
   difference in the IPv6 source address should be used in order to 
   differentiate the packets sent on interfaces and virtual links. 
    
   As the end point IP addresses of the virtual links are not known at 
   the time of configuration, the secure channel for these packets need 
   to be setup dynamically. The end point IP addresses of virtual links 
   are learnt during the routing table build up process. The packet 
   exchange over the virtual links starts only after the discovery of 
   end point IP addresses. In order to provide security to these 
   exchanges, the routing module should setup a secure IPsec channel 
   dynamically once it acquires the required information. 
    
9. IPsec rules 
    
   The following set of rules can be installed in a typical IPsec 
   implementation to provide the authentication/confidentiality to 
   OSPFv3 packets.  
    
   Outbound Rules for interface running OSPFv3 security: 
    
   No. interface      source       destination      protocol      action 
   1     iface      fe80::/16        any             OSPF         apply 
   2      any        src/128       dst/128           OSPF         apply 
    
   Inbound Rules for interface running OSPFv3 security: 
    
   No. interface      source       destination      protocol      action 
   3     iface      fe80::/16        any           ESP or AH      apply 
   4     iface      fe80::/16        any             OSPF         drop 
   5      any        src/128       dst/128         ESP or AH      apply 
   6      any        src/128       dst/128           OSPF         drop 
    
   For outbound rules, action "apply" means encrypting/calculating ICV 
   and adding ESP or AH header. For inbound rules, action "apply" means 
   decrypting/authenticating the packets and stripping ESP or AH header. 
    
   Rules 4 and 6 are to drop the in-secure OSPFv3 packets without ESP/AH 
   headers. 
    
   Rules 2, 5 and 6 are meant to secure the packets being exchanged over 
   virtual links. These rules are dynamically installed after learning 
   the end point IP addresses of a virtual link. These rules are 
   installed on all the interfaces.

   Rules 1, 3 and 4 are meant to secure the unicast and multicast 
   packets that are not being exchanged over the virtual links. These 
   rules are interface specific. 
    
10. Replay Protection 
 
   As it is not possible as per the current standards to provide 
   complete replay protection while using manual keying, the proposed 
   solution will not provide protection against replay attacks. 
    
   Fields LS age, LS Sequence Number and LS checksum in LSA header are 
   kept intact in OSPFv3. Though these fields do not provide the 
   complete protection, they certainly help against replay attacks. 
 
Security Considerations 
    
   This memo discusses the use of IPsec AH and ESP headers in order to 
   provide security to OSPFv3 for IPv6. 
    
   The use of manual keying does not provide very high level of security 
   as compared to IKE but the security provided should be adequate for a 
   routing protocol.
