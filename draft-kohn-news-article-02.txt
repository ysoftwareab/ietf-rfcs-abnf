Abstract

   This document defines the format of network news articles. This is
   the first of four documents that update and obsolete RFC 1036.  This
   document focuses on the syntax semantics of network news articles.
   RFC XXXX is also a standards-track document describing the protocol
   issues for network news transmission, independent of protocols such
   as NNTP and IMAP.  An informational document, RFC YYYY, describes
   recommendations to improve interoperability and usability.  The
   fourth document, RFC ZZZZ, an experimental document, specifies
   internationalization of message headers.

   Network news articles resemble mail messages but are broadcast to

   potentially large audiences, using a flooding algorithm that
   propagates one copy to each interested host (or group thereof),
   typically stores only one copy per host, and does not require any
   central administration or systematic registration of interested
   users. Network news originated as the medium of communication for
   Usenet, circa 1980. Since then Usenet has grown explosively, and many
   Internet sites participate in it. In addition, the news technology is
   now in widespread use for other purposes, on the Internet and
   elsewhere.

   This document defines the format of network news articles in the
   context of the Internet Message Format, and adds MIME support for
   multimedia and internationalized message bodies.

1. Introduction

1.1 Scope

   "Netnews" is a set of protocols for generating, storing and
   retrieving news "articles" (which use the Internet Message Format)
   and for exchanging them among a readership which is potentially
   widely distributed. It is organized around "newsgroups", with the
   expectation that each reader will be able to see all articles posted
   to each newsgroup in which she participates. These protocols most
   commonly use a flooding algorithm which propagates copies throughout
   a network of participating servers.  Typically, only one copy is
   stored per server, and each server makes it available on demand to
   readers able to access that server.

   The predecessor to this document [RFC1036] said that: "In any
   situation where this standard conflicts with the Internet [email
   standard, the latter] should be considered correct and this standard
   in error." The basic philosophy of this document follows that
   previous convention, so as to standardize news article syntax firmly
   in the context of Internet Message Format syntax.  In the context of
   the Internet messaging architecture, different protocols (such as
   IMAP [RFC2060], POP3 [RFC1939], NNTP [RFC0977] and SMTP [RFC2821])
   are seen as alternative ways of moving around the same content.  That
   content is the Internet Message Format as specified by [RFC2822],
   including optional enhancements such as MIME [RFC2049]. A user should
   be able to ingest an article via NNTP, read it via IMAP, forward it
   off to someone else via SMTP and have them read it via POP3 all
   without having to alter the content.

   This document uses a cite by reference methodology, rather than
   trying to repeat the contents of other standards, which could
   otherwise result in subtle differences and interoperability
   challenges.  Although this document is as a result rather short, it
   requires complete understanding and implementation of the normative
   references to be compliant.

1.2 Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.3 Errata

   The RFC Editor makes available errata for RFCs at [errata].
   Implementers should review that page for normative references, noting
   in particular that errata currently exist for [RFC2046].

Internet-Draft            News Article Format                 March 2003


1.4 Syntax Notation

   Headers defined in this specification use the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation (including the Core Rules) specified in
   [RFC2234] and many constructs (specifically <date-time>,
   <mailbox-list>, <obs-zone>, and <unstructured>) defined in [RFC2822].
   Section 3.5 updates the [RFC2822] definition of <msg-id>.

1.5 Definitions

   Add definitions here for at least article, user agent, injector,
   moderator, server, and gateway.  Agent refers generically to all
   roles.

1.6 Structure of This Document

   Section 2 defines the format of news articles. Section 3 defines some
   additional headers necessary for the netnews environment.

Internet-Draft            News Article Format                 March 2003


2. Format

2.1 Base

   News articles MUST conform to the "legal to generate syntax"
   specified in Section 3 of [RFC2822]. News agents SHOULD also support
   the obsolete syntax specified in Section 4 of [RFC2822], particularly
   to support old news messages and gatewayed obsolete mail messages,
   but they MUST NOT generate such syntax.

2.2 MIME Conformance

   User agents MUST meet the definition of MIME-conformance in
   [RFC2049].  This level of MIME Conformance provides support for
   internationalization and multimedia in message bodies, and for
   receipt (but not generation) of internationalized headers.
   Generation of internationalized message headers is specified by RFC
   ZZZZ.

2.3 Other MIME Support

   User agents conformant with this document SHOULD support receipt (and
   automatic reassembly) of message/partial MIME messages, as specified
   in Section 5.2.2 of [RFC2046] and MAY support generation of message/
   partial articles for excessively large articles.

   User agents SHOULD send regular paragraph text as "text/plain;
   format=flowed" as specified in [RFC2646] and SHOULD preserve flowed
   text (including quoting) when replying or forwarding, as described in
   that specification.

   User agents SHOULD support on receipt and MAY generate extension
   header fields, including but not limited to Content-Disposition
   [RFC2183] and Content-Language [RFC3282].

3. Headers

3.1 New Internet Message Format Headers

   The following header fields extend the fields defined in section 3.6
   of [RFC2822] as follows:

   fields          =/ *( newsgroups /
                         path /
                         followup-to /
                         expires /
                         control /
                         distribution /
                         summary /
                         approved /
                         organization /
                         xref /
                         supersedes )

   Each of these headers may occur at most once in a news article.

3.2 Mandatory Headers

   Each news article conformant with this specification MUST have
   exactly one of each of the following headers: From, Subject,
   Message-ID, Date, Newsgroups, and Path. From is exactly as specified
   in [RFC2822]. Date and Subject are fully conformant with [RFC2822],
   though with extra implementation advice in Section 3.3 and Section
   3.4, respectively.

   In Section 3.5, this document updates the <msg-id> construct from
   [RFC2822] so as to ensure that Internet Message Format Message-IDs
   are usable in widely deployed news software.

   Following [RFC2822] syntax, the headers defined in this document do
   not require a space between the ":" and the field's contents. (E.g.,
   "Subject:Hello World" is acceptable, as opposed to requiring
   "Subject: Hello World".)  To be compliant with this specification,
   news agents MUST support 0 or more spaces between the colon and the
   field's contents.  However, to maximize compatibility with the
   installed base of news agents, implementers SHOULD use exactly one
   space.

3.3 Date

   The Date header is the same as that specified in Sections 3.3 and
   3.6.1 of [RFC2822].  However, the use of "GMT" as a time zone, which
   is part of <obs-zone>, is widespread in news articles today.



Kohn                   Expires September 17, 2003               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            News Article Format                 March 2003


   Therefore, agents MUST accept, but MUST NOT generate, <date-time>
   constructs where <obs-zone>="GMT". (As stated in Section 2.1, support
   for <obs-zone> would otherwise have been SHOULD accept, MUST NOT
   generate.) Note that these requirements apply wherever <date-time> is
   used, including Expires in Section 3.6.4.


3.4 Subject

   The Subject header contains a short string identifying the topic of
   the message. Section 3.6.5 of [RFC2822] says:

      When used in a reply, the field body MAY start with the string
      "Re: " (from the Latin "res", in the matter of) followed by the
      contents of the "Subject:" field body of the original message.  If
      this is done, only one instance of the literal string "Re: " ought
      to be used since use of other strings or more than one instance
      can lead to undesirable consequences.

   Because of the importance of threading in news, that MAY is amplified
   to a SHOULD: Follow-ups to an article SHOULD begin with the subject
   "Re: " followed by the original subject of the referenced article
   (with that original subject stripped of any starting "Re: ").

   User agents MAY remove strings that are known to be used erroneously
   as back-reference (such as "Re(2): ", "Re:", "RE: ", or "Sv: ") from
   the beginning of the Subject field body when composing the subject of
   a followup, and add a correct back-reference in front of the result.

   User agents replying to a message MUST NOT use any other string
   except "Re: " as a back reference. Specifically, a translation of
   "Re: " into a local language or usage MUST NOT be used.

   User agents MAY present to the user a translation of "Re: ", but this
   MUST only be an artifact of the user interface and MUST NOT be part
   of the actual news article.

3.5 Message-ID

   The "Message-ID:" field contains a single unique message identifier.
   This is the only header field definition that updates [RFC2822].  The
   ABNF should be used as below, but the requirements and descriptive
   text from Section 3.6.4 of [RFC2822] still apply.

Internet-Draft            News Article Format                 March 2003


   message-id      =  "Message-ID:" msg-id CRLF

   msg-id          =  [CFWS] msg-id-core [CFWS]

   msg-id-core     =  "<" id-left "@" id-right ">"
                      ; maximum length is 250 octets

   id-left         =  dot-atom-text / no-fold-quote / obs-id-left

   id-right        =  dot-atom-text / no-fold-literal / obs-id-right

   no-fold-quote   =  DQUOTE *( qtext / no-space-qp ) DQUOTE

   no-fold-literal =  "[" *( htext / no-space-qp ) "]"

   no-space-qp     =  ( "\" ptext ) / obs-qp

   ptext           =  %d33-61 /  ; Printable characters excluding ">"
                      %d63-126 /
                      obs-text

   htext           =  HEXDIG /  ; hexadecimal digits, case-insensitive
                      "." /     ; IPv4 separator
                      ":"       ; IPv6 separator

   Although compliant agents MUST support [CFWS] between the
   "Message-ID:" and the <msg-id-core>, implementers SHOULD generate
   exactly one space there, to maximize compatibility with the installed
   base.

   Note that this updated ABNF applies wherever <msg-id> is used,
   including the In-Reply-To and References headers mentioned in Section
   3.7 and Section 3.7.1.

3.6 News Headers

3.6.1 Newsgroups

   The Newsgroups header specifies to which newsgroup(s) the article is
   posted.

Internet-Draft            News Article Format                 March 2003


   newsgroups      =  "Newsgroups:" newsgroup-list CRLF

   newsgroup-list  =  [FWS] newsgroup-name
                      *( "," [FWS] newsgroup-name ) [FWS]

   newsgroup-name  =  component *( "." component ) ; 71 character max

   component       =  plain-component

   plain-component =  component-start *29component-rest

   component-start =  ALPHA / DIGIT

   component-rest  =  ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "_"

   A newsgroup name consists of one or more components separated by
   periods, with no more than 71 characters total.  Each component
   consists of less than 30 or less letters and digits.

3.6.2 Path

   The Path header's content indicates which relayers the article has
   already visited, so that unnecessary redundant transmission can be
   avoided.

   path            =  "Path:" [FWS]
                      *( path-host [FWS] path-delimiter [FWS] )
                      path-host [FWS] CRLF

   path-host       =  ( ALPHA / DIGIT )
                      *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / ":" / "_" )

   path-delimiter  =  "!"

3.6.3 Followup-To

   The Followup-To header specifies to which newsgroup(s) followups
   should be posted.

   followup-to     =  "Followup-To:" ( newsgroup-list / poster-text )
                      CRLF

   poster-text     =  [FWS] %d112.111.115.116.101.114 [FWS]
                      ; "poster" in lower-case

   The syntax is the same as that of the Newsgroups content, with the
   exception that the magic word "poster" (which is always lowercase)
   means that followups should be mailed to the article's reply address

Internet-Draft            News Article Format                 March 2003


   rather than posted.

3.6.4 Expires

   The Expires header content specifies a date and time when the article
   is deemed to be no longer useful and could usefully be removed
   ("expired").

   expires         =  "Expires:" date-time CRLF

3.6.5 Control

   The Control header marks the article as a control message, and
   specifies the desired actions (additional to the usual ones of
   storing and/or relaying the article).  The verb indicates what action
   should be taken, and the argument(s) (if any) supply details. In some
   cases, the body of the article may also contain details. Control
   messages are further specified in the companion document, RFC XXXX.

   control         =  "Control:" verb *( FWS argument ) CRLF

   An article with a Control header MUST NOT have a Supersedes header.

3.6.6 Distribution

   The Distribution header content specifies geographic or
   organizational limits on an article's propagation.

   distribution    =  "Distribution:" dist-name *( "," dist-name ) CRLF

   dist-name       =  [FWS] ALPHA / DIGIT
                      *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "_" ) [FWS]

   "All" MUST NOT be used as a distribution-name.  Distribution-names
   SHOULD contain at least three characters, except when they are
   two-letter country names as in [ISO.3166.1988].  Distribution-names
   are case-insensitive (i.e. "US", "Us" and "us" all specify the same
   distribution).

3.6.7 Summary

   The Summary header content is a short phrase summarizing the
   article's content.

   summary         =  "Summary:" unstructured CRLF

Internet-Draft            News Article Format                 March 2003


3.6.8 Approved

   The Approved header content indicates the mailing addresses (and
   possibly the full names) of the persons or entities approving the
   article for posting.

   approved        =  "Approved:" mailbox-list CRLF

3.6.9 Organization

   The Organization header content is a short phrase identifying the
   poster's organization.

   organization    =  "Organization:" unstructured CRLF

   There is no "s" in Organization.

3.6.10 Xref

   The Xref header content indicates where an article was filed by the
   last relayer to process it.

   xref            =  "Xref:" [CFWS] path-host
                      1*( CFWS location ) [CFWS]

   location        =  newsgroup-name ":" 1*16DIGIT

3.6.11 Supersedes

   The Supersedes header content specifies articles to be cancelled.

   supersedes      =  "Supersedes:" 1*( [FWS] msg-id-core ) CRLF

   There is no "c" in Supersedes.

3.7 Other Message Headers

   The headers Reply-To, Sender, Comments, and Keywords are often used
   in news articles and have the identical meaning as that specified in
   [RFC2822].  In-Reply-To is also regularly used in news articles and
   has same the same meaning as that specified in [RFC2822], except that
   it uses the updated <msg-id> construct defined in Section 3.5.

3.7.1 References

   The References header has the same syntax as [RFC2822], except that
   it uses the updated <msg-id> construct defined in Section 3.5 and
   also adds the following requirements to the semantics.

4. Internationalization Considerations

   Internationalization of news article bodies is provided using MIME
   mechanisms in Section 2.2.  Generation of internationalized message
   headers is not specified in this document, and is instead specified
   in the experimental document, RFC ZZZZ.

5. Security Considerations

   The news article format specified in this document does not provide
   any security services, such as confidentiality, authentication of
   sender, or non-forgery.  Instead, such services need to be layered
   above, using such protocols as S/MIME [RFC2633] or PGP/MIME
   [RFC3156], or below, using secure versions of news transport
   protocols.  Additionally, several currently non-standardized
   protocols [PGPVERIFY] will hopefully be standardized in the near
   future.

   Message-IDs (see Section 3.5) in news are required to be unique;
   articles are refused (in server-to-server transfer) if the ID has
   already been seen. So if you can predict the ID of a message, you can
   pre-empt it by posting a message (possibly to a quite different
   group) with the same ID, stopping your target message from
   propagating.  Agents that generate message-ids for news articles
   SHOULD ensure that they are unpredictable.
