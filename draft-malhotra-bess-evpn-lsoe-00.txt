                LSoE-based PE-CE Control Plane for EVPN
                    draft-malhotra-bess-evpn-lsoe-00

Abstract

   In an EVPN network, EVPN PEs provide VPN bridging and routing service
   to connected CE devices based on BGP EVPN control plane. At present,
   there is no PE-CE control plane defined for an EVPN PE to learn CE
   MAC, IP, and any other routes from a CE that may be distributed in
   EVPN control plane to enable unicast flows between CE devices. As a
   result, EVPN PEs rely on data plane based gleaning of source MACs for
   CE MAC learning, ARP/ND snooping for CE IPv4/IPv6 learning, and in
   some cases, local configuration for learning prefix routes behind a
   CE. A PE-CE control plane alternative to this traditional learning
   approach, where applicable, offers certain distinct advantages that
   in turn result in simplified EVPN operation. 

   This document defines a PE-CE control plane as an optional
   alternative to traditional non-control-plane based PE-CE learning in
   an EVPN network. It defines PE-CE control plane procedures and TLVs
   based on LSoE as the base protocol, enumerates advantages that may be
   achieved by using this PE-CE control plane, and discusses in detail
   EVPN use cases that are simplified as a result.

INTERNET DRAFT  LSoE-based PE-CE Control Plane for EVPN                 


1  Introduction

   In an EVPN network, CE devices typically connect to an EVPN PE via
   layer-2 interfaces that terminate in a BD on the PE. Multi-homed LAG
   interfaces together with EVPN all-active multi-homing procedures are
   used to achieve PE-CE link and PE node redundancy for fault-tolerance
   and load-balancing. PEs provide overlay bridging and, optionally,
   first-hop routing service for these CE devices based on an EVPN
   control plane that is used to distribute CE MAC, IP, and prefix
   reachability across PEs.

   At present, there is no PE-CE control plane defined for an EVPN PE to
   learn connected CE host MACs and IPs. As a result, EVPN PEs rely on:

     o data plane based gleaning of source MAC for MAC learning,
     o ARP snooping for IPv4 + MAC learning, and
     o ND snooping for IPv6 + MAC learning.

   A PE-CE control plane alternative to this traditional learning
   approach, where applicable, can offer some distinct advantages across
   various boot-up, mobility, and convergence scenarios:

     o PE-CE learning is decoupled from non-deterministic hashing of 
       data, ARP, and ND packets from CEs over all-active multi-homed
       LAG interfaces.
     o PE-CE learning is decoupled from non-deterministic periodicity 
       of data traffic from CEs or, in an extreme scenario, from CE
       device being silent for an extended period.
     o PE-CE learning is decoupled from non-deterministic CE behavior 
       with respect to unsolicited ARPs and NAs following boot-up and
       moves.
     o PE-CE learning is decoupled from latencies associated with data 
       packet triggered ARP and ND gleaning.

   This in-turn results in simplification of certain EVPN operations
   such as aliasing, MAC and IP syncing across multi-homing PEs, and
   probing on MAC/IP moves. In addition, it helps achieve a
   deterministic convergence behavior across various boot-up, mobility,
   and failure scenarios.

   A PE may also use local policy configuration for learning prefixes
   behind a CE that does not run a dynamic routing protocol. A PE-CE
   control plane can provide an operationally simpler alternative to
   local configuration for such use cases, where CE and PE devices are
   not under the same configuration management entity.

   This document defines a new PE-CE control plane as an alternative to
   traditional data-plane and ARP/ND snooping based PE-CE host learning

   and to local configuration-based PE-CE prefix learning. It defines
   PE-CE control plane procedures and TLVs based on [LSOE] as the base
   protocol, enumerates advantages that may be achieved by using this
   PE-CE control plane, and discusses in detail EVPN operations that are
   simplified as a result. Use of PE-CE control plane defined in this
   document is intended to be optional and backwards compatible with CEs
   that use traditional PE-CE learning within the same BD.

2. PE <-> CE Control Plane Overview

   The Link State over Ethernet (LSoE) protocol is defined in [LSOE] as
   a protocol over Ethernet links to auto-discover connected neighbor's
   layer 2, layer 3 attributes, and encapsulations for the purpose of
   bringing up upper layer routing protocols. This document leverages
   LSoE as a PE-CE protocol in an EVPN network fabric on access links
   between an EVPN PE and CE. Specifically,

     o PE-CE control plane based on LSoE protocol is proposed for CE 
       MAC learning as an alternative to data-plane based source MAC
       learning.
     o PE-CE control plane based on LSoE protocol is proposed for CE
       MAC-IP adjacency learning as an alternative to MAC-IP learning
       based on ARP/ND snooping.
     o PE-CE control plane based on LSoE is proposed for learning of 
       IP Prefixes and associated overlay indexes, as an alternative to
       local configuration on the PE for use case defined in section 4.1
       of [EVPN-PREFIX-ADV].

   Note that any specification related to base LSoE protocol itself is
   considered out of scope for this document and will continue to be
   covered in the base protocol spec. This document will instead focus
   on procedures and TLV extensions needed to achieve the above learning
   on PE-CE links in an EVPN network. Any text that relates to the base
   protocol included in this document is simply background information
   in the context of use cases covered in this document. The reader
   should refer to the base LSoE protocol document for the exact LSoE
   protocol specification.

   An LSoE session is established on layer-2 access interfaces between
   the EVPN PE and each connected CE host device. A session end-point is
   identified by a peer device MAC address on a layer-2 interface. LSoE
   HELLO messages are used for end-point discovery and OPEN messages are
   exchanged between two end-points to establish an LSoE peering. Once
   LSoE peering is established, encapsulation TLVs are exchanged for
   learning.

   In the context of an EVPN network, CE Attachment Circuits (AC logical
   interfaces) typically terminate in a BD on the PE, with multi-homed
   LAG interfaces used for EVPN all-active multi-homing. CE hosts may be
   directly connected to EVPN PEs via access ports, or may be connected
   on trunk-ports via another switch. In a common EVPN-IRB design, EVPN
   PEs also function as distributed first-hop gateways for hosts in a
   BD. While symmetric and asymmetric IRB designs are possible as
   discussed in [EVPN IRB], procedures described in subsequent sections
   assume symmetric IRB with distributed any-cast gateways on EVPN PEs.
   Any deviations from these procedures for asymmetric IRB design or a
   centralized IRB design will be covered in future updates to this
   document.

   The next few sections will focus on additional LSoE TLVs and
   procedures needed for PE-CE learning on EVPN PE ACs without and with
   all-active multi-homing.

     o A new LSoE PDU type (8) is requested for this PDU.
     o The IPv4 Address is that of an overlay.
     o MAC address carries the MAC binding for the particular IPv4  
       address if one is set in the PDU. If an IPv4 address is not set,
       it simply signals an overlay MAC address.
     o EVPN flag 'E' indicates if this encapsulation is being sent on 
       behalf of a remote host learnt via EVPN. Use of this flag is
       covered in a later section.

   This PDU is used to carry PE's any-cast gateway IPv4 address and MAC
   bindings to a CE host device. Optionally, it may also be used to
   relay a remote CE's IPv4 address and MAC bindings to a local CE host

   In comparison to IPv4 Encapsulation PDU defined in [LSOE], this PDU
   allows you to explicitly signal a MAC binding that MAY be different
   from the device MAC used to establish an LSoE peering via HELLO/OPEN
   messages exchange.

   The encapsulation list in this PDU MUST follow full replace semantics
   as in the LSoE protocol specification.

   semantics as in the LSoE protocol specification.

   Multiple prefixes may be set for a single GW IP. The encapsulation
   list contained in this PDU MUST follow full replace semantics as in
   the LSoE protocol specification.

4. CE MAC/IP Learning on a PE AC

   This section defines procedures for learning a connected CE MAC and
   IP on a PE local attachment circuit (AC).

4.1 PE <-> CE LSoE Session Establishment

   On an EVPN PE,

   o A HELLO and/or OPEN PDU sent from a CE host source MAC is 
     received on a tagged or untagged interface that is member of a
     local BD, referred here to as an AC.
   o OPEN messages are exchanged with the host on the AC.
   o LSoE session is established to the host source MAC and bound to a 
     local AC.

4.2 CE MAC/IP Learning

   Overlay IPv4 and IPv6 encapsulation PDU types 8/9 from a CE are used
   for the purpose of CE MAC/IP learning on a PE:

   o The EVPN flag 'E' MUST NOT be set in type 8/9 PDU from a CE.
   o A MAC entry for the MAC received in a type 8/9 PDU MUST be 
     installed in the MAC-VRF table pointing to the AC to which the
     session is bound.
   o If an IPv4/IPv6 address is set in the PDU, an IPv4/IPv6 neighbor 
     binding MUST be established for the IPv4/IPv6 address in the PDU to
     the MAC address in the PDU. In other words, a next-hop re-write for
     these IPv4/IPv6 neighbor entries MUST be installed using the MAC
     address in the PDU, and if required by forwarding logic, bound to
     the AC associated with the LSoE session.
   o Note that an IPv4/IPv6 address MAY NOT be set in a type 8/9 PDU
     received from a CE, in which case this PDU is only used for MAC
     learning. This MAY be the case in a non-IRB EVPN network, wherein,
     an EVPN PE is not a first-hop router for the attached CEs.

INTERNET DRAFT  LSoE-based PE-CE Control Plane for EVPN                 


5. PE Any-cast GW MAC/IP Learning on CE

   If LSoE based host learning is enabled on a PE with a distributed
   any-cast gateway on the EVPN PE, 

   o EVPN PE MUST send type 8/9 Overlay Encapsulation PDUs on 
     associated ACs with LSoE sessions toward CE hosts.
   o Type 8/9 PDUs from an EVPN PE MUST be encoded with the any-cast 
     gateway IPv4/IPv6 address and any-cast gateway MAC address.
   o EVPN flag 'E' MUST NOT be set in this PDU.
   o A CE MAY process type 8/9 PDUs to establish GW IP to MAC  
     bindings and learn gateway MAC to LAG AC bindings, similar to
     handling of type 8/9 PDUs on the PE described above.

   Handling of type 8/9 PDUs for the purpose of gateway learning on the
   host is desirable but optional. A CE MAY continue to use ARP and ND
   for this purpose.

6. Remote CE MAC/IP Learning on CE

   For CE to CE intra-subnet flows across the overlay, CE needs to learn
   and install a neighbor IP to MAC binding for remote CEs. This is
   handled today either by flooding ARP/ND requests across the overlay
   bridge and optionally implementing an ARP/ND suppression cache on the
   PE that is populated via MAC+IP EVPN route-type 2. ARP/ND request
   frames are trapped on the PE that does a local ARP/ND reply on behalf
   of the remote CE. If LSoE based learning is enabled in the fabric,
   LSoE may be used for this purpose to avoid overlay ARP/ND flooding,
   data frame triggered ARP learning, and to avoid maintaining an ARP
   suppression cache on the PE.

   o Remote MAC-IP routes learned via BGP EVPN route-type 2 that are 
     imported to a local MAC-VRF MAY also be sent as type 8/9 PDUs on
     LSoE sessions to CEs over local ACs in that BD.
   o EVPN flag 'E' MUST be set in this encapsulation in the PDU.
   o A CE MAY install IPv4/IPv6 neighbor MAC bindings for remote 
     CEs within a subnet based on 'E' flagged type 8/9 PDUs received
     from the PE.

   Handling of type 8/9 PDUs for this purpose is optional but desirable
   to get full benefit of a fabric that is completely setup on boot-up,
   avoids overlay flooding, and is decoupled from latencies associated
   with data plane driven ARP and ND learning.

                                  Figure 6


   In an EVPN all-active multi-homing setup, a LAG interface on the CE
   includes member physical ports that connect to multiple PE devices. A
   subset of these member ports that terminate at a PE are configured as
   members of a local LAG interface at that PE. A LAG AC at the PE is a
   logical interface in a BD, identified by this LAG interface and
   optionally, an Ethernet Tag in case of trunk ports.

   In order for LSoE based learning to work with EVPN all-active multi-
   homing, a separate LSoE peering MUST be established between the CE
   host and each PE device. For this reason, while an EVPN PE MAY form
   an LSoE peering to a CE host on its local LAG AC, the CE host MUST
   form an LSoE peering to a PE on a local LAG "member physical port".

   A configurable All-active Multi-Homing mode is defined below in order
   to be able to bind an LSoE peering to a LAG member-port as opposed to
   a LAG interface.

7.1 All-active Multi-Homing Mode

   When configured to run on a local LAG port in this mode,

     o LSoE HELLO messages MUST be replicated on ALL LAG member ports.
     o An LSoE OPEN message sent in response to a HELLO MUST be sent on 
       the LAG member port on which the HELLO was received.
     o An LSoE session MUST be bound to the local LAG member port on

       which the OPEN message was received.
     o LSoE encapsulation PDUs MUST be sent on the local LAG member 
       port on which the session was bound.
     o LSoE Keep-Alives MUST be sent on the local LAG member port on 
       which the session was bound.

   Note that this may result in a PE receiving multiple HELLO PDUs from
   a CE MAC. This however is harmless, as per the [LSOE] specification.
   A PE simply drops redundant HELLOs from a MAC that it has already
   replied to with an OPEN, within a retry time window.

7.2 Source MAC

   LSoE relies on the source MAC address in the Ethernet frame to
   establish a peering. When running LSoE on a LAG port (in all-active
   multi-homing mode or regular mode), LSoE frames MUST use the LAG
   interface MAC as the source MAC address in the Ethernet frame. 

7.3 CE MAC/IP Learning with EVPN All-active Multi-Homing

   In order to accomplish MAC/IP learning of CE host devices multi-homed
   to EVPN fabric PEs via EVPN All-active Multi-Homing:

     o A multi-homed CE device MUST be configured to run LSoE on a 
       local LAG interfaces in All-active Multi-Homing mode defined
       above.
     o EVPN PE MAY run LSoE on local LAG interfaces to multi-homed CE 
       devices in regular mode. 
     o EVPN PEs that share the same Ethernet Segment MUST use unique 
       source MACs (that of the local LAG) in HELLO/OPEN messages to
       establish separate LSoE sessions to a CE.

   With the above rules in place,

     o An LSoE session on the CE is bound to a local LAG member-port.
     o An LSoE session on the PE is bound to a local LAG AC port.
     o A single LSoE session is established at the PE to a CE on the 
       local LAG AC.
     o 'N' LSoE sessions are established at the CE, one to each PE on a 
       local LAG member interface, where N = number of multi-homing PEs
       in an Ethernet Segment. 

   Once an LSoE session is established as above, all other host learning
   procedures defined earlier for CE MAC/IP learning on a PE's AC port
   apply as is to a LAG AC in an EVPN all-active multi-homing setup.

7.4 LAG Member Link Failure

   On a CE that is running in all-active multi-homing mode, an LSoE
   session to a PE is bound to a LAG member interface. If the link that
   the LSoE session is bound to fails, LSoE session will get torn down
   at the CE by virtue of the session interface going down. If the CE
   has additional active member link(s) to this PE, a new LSoE session
   must be established on one of the active member links via HELLO PDUs
   sent by the CE on its remaining active member links to the PE.

7.4.1 Session Re-establishment

   LSoE session at the CE is torn down immediately following the session
   interface failure.  While the LAG interface at the PE is still
   operationally UP, LSoE session at the PE is subject to Keep Alive
   PDUs received from the CE. Once the session expires at the PE because
   of missed Keep Alive PDUs from the CE, PE will respond to HELLO on
   one of the active member link with an OPEN to re-establish a new
   session. Note that the new session is still bound to the LAG AC at
   the PE and to a new member link at the CE.

7.4.2 TLV Retention

   TLVs learnt from a CE over a failed session MUST be retained at the
   PE if the PE LAG AC is still operationally up following a member link
   failure because of active member link(s) in the LAG. TLV retention
   logic at the PE MAY be based on an age-out time, that is a local
   matter at the PE. TLV age-out time MUST be higher than the missed
   Keep Alive duration, after which the session is considered closed.
   Once a new LSoE session is established, PE MUST implement a mark and
   sweep logic to reconcile retained TLVs from the CE peer with the new
   set of TLVs received from this CE.

7.4 LAG Failure

   When a LAG member link failure results in the LAG interface being
   operationally down, TLV age-out logic discussed above MUST NOT be in
   effect. LSoE session MAY be be considered as DOWN immediately on the
   LAG being down at the PE. This is so that, in the event of a total
   connectivity loss between a PE and CE, CE learnt routes can be
   withdrawn immediately.

8. Software Neighbor Tables

   Some networking stack implementations rely on ARP and ND populated
   neighbor tables for software forwarding. In order to inter-work with
   such an implementation, an LsoE learned IPv4/IPv6 neighbor entry MAY
   also be installed in ARP and ND neighbor table as a static /
   permanent entry. 

   In addition,

     o Pre-installing LSoE learned neighbor entries may help reduce 
       potential conflict with ARP or ND learned neighbor entries.
     o Pre-installing LSoE learned neighbor entries may help reduce   
       reliance on data traffic triggered ARP requests / ND
       solicitations and associated learning latency.

   With respect to installing IPv6 entries learnt via LSoE in IPv6 ND
   cache, Router flag (R-bit) and Override flag (O-bit) received in LSoE
   PDU should be handled as defined in [RFC4861].

9. MAC/IP Learning Conflict Resolution

   If LSoE learned neighbor entries are not already installed as static
   entries in ARP/ND neighbor table, it is possible that a neighbor
   IPv4/IPv6 adjacency may be learned both via LSoE and ARP/ND. Even if
   LSoE learned entries were pre-installed in neighbor table, a race
   condition is still possible leading to a potential conflict between
   ARP/ND learned and LSoE learned neighbor IP adjacency. In such
   scenarios, LSoE learned entry should be preferred for the purpose of
   programming neighbor IP adjacencies in forwarding.

   With respect to MAC-VRF entries, it is recommended that data plane
   learning be turned off when LSoE based learning is enabled. However,
   if it is not, data plane learned entries MUST be reconciled with LSoE
   learned entries in software and, in case of a conflict, LSoE learned
   entries preferred if LSoE based learning is enabled.

10. PE-CE Overlay Prefix Learning

   [EVPN-PREFIX-ADV] section 4.1 defines a use case, wherein, a PE may
   advertise IP prefixes and subnets behind a CE. In this use case, CE
   device does not run a dynamic routing protocol. Instead, these
   prefixes are learnt on the PE via local policy or configuration.
   Prefixes are then advertised by PE as RT-5 with the CE as the GW.

   PE-CE control plane defined in this document MAY be used to learn
   these prefixes from a CE as an alternative to local configuration on
   the PE. Once an LSoE session is established between a CE and a PE, as
   discussed earlier,

     o A CE MAY send type 10/11 PDUs with these IPv4/IPv6 prefixes over 
       an LSoE session to a PE with the CE IP as the GW IP.
     o A PE MAY advertise prefixes learnt via type 10/11 PDUs as RT-5 
       with CE IP as the GW IP.

   To summarize, A PE would advertise:

     o RT-2 for the CE MAC-IP learnt via type 8/9 PDU
     o RT-5 for Prefixes learnt via type 10/11 PDU with GW IP = CE IP

     This section will discuss in detail, benefits and simplifications
     that may be achieved in the context of an EVPN network, if one
     chooses to implement PE-CE control plane defined in this document
     as opposed to using traditional data-plane and ARP/ND snooping
     based PE-CE learning.

   Data plane and ARP/ND snooping based MAC/IP learning on PE-CE all-
   active multi-homed LAG ports is subject to unpredictable hashing of
   ARP, ND, and data frames from host to PE. As an example, an ARP
   request for a connected host might originate at PE1 but the resulting
   ARP response from the host might be received at PE2. Redundant EVPN
   PEs in all-active multi-homing mode typically handle this
   unpredictability via combination of methods below:

     o PEs can handle unsolicited ARP and ND response frames.
     o PEs can implement additional mechanism to SYNC ARP, ND, and  
       MAC tables across all PEs in a redundancy group for optimal
       forwarding to locally connected hosts.
     o PEs can implement EVPN aliasing procedures discussed in 
       [RFC 7432] OR re-originate SYNCed MAC-IP adjacencies as local RT-
       2 to achieve MAC ECMP across the overlay.
     o PEs can also re-originate SYNCed MAC-IP adjacencies as local 
       RT-2 to achieve IP ECMP across the overlay OR implement IP
       aliasing procedures discussed in [EVPN-IP-ALIASING].
     o PEs can also ensure EVPN sequence number SYNC for local MAC 
       entries for EVPN mobility procedures to work correctly, as
       discussed in [EVPN-IRB-MOBILITY].

   The PE-CE control plane learning alternative defined in this document
   fully decouples MAC and IP learning over MLAG ports from
   unpredictable hashing of data, AR, ND frames on all-active multi-

   essentially result from data-plane PE-CE learning on all-active
   multi-homed LAGs can be simplified via the PE-CE control plane

   Host mobility across EVPN PE switches is a common occurrence in a
   data center fabric for flexibility in work load placement across a
   DC. Further, a host move must result in minimal, if any, disruption
   to traffic flows / services to / from the device.

   Data plane and ARP/ND snooping based PE-CE learning may result in
   unpredictable convergence times, following host moves for the
   following cases:

     o A host may or may not send any data packet immediately following 
       a move.
     o A host may or may not send an unsolicited ARP following a move.

   While probing procedures, discussed in the next sub-sections are
   typically used to minimize convergence time, certain scenarios
   discussed below may still result in extended convergence times and
   flooding.

13.1.2.1  Silent Hosts

   If a host is silent for an extended period following a move from PE1
   to PE2, any bridged traffic flow destined to this host will continue
   to be black-holed by PE1 until the MAC ages out at PE1. Once the the
   MAC ages out at PE1, any bridged traffic flow destined to the host is

   flooded across the overlay bridge. Flooding of unknown unicast
   traffic on the overlay is enabled for this purpose. In summary, PE-CE
   learning that is based on data-plane and AR/ND snooping may be
   subject to non-deterministic convergence time and flooding following
   host moves because of being heavily dependent on unpredictable CE
   behavior.

   PE-CE control plane based learning defined in this document fully
   decouples convergence in such scenarios from non-deterministic data
   flows and unsolicited ARP/ND behavior on a CE.

13.1.2.2  Probing

   ARP and ND probing procedures are typically used to achieve host re-
   learning and convergence following host moves across the overlay:

     o Following a host move from PE1 to PE2, the host's MAC is 
       discovered at PE2 as a local MAC via a data frames received from
       the host. If PE2 has a prior REMOTE MAC-IP host route for this
       MAC from PE1, an ARP probe is typically triggered at PE2 to learn
       the MAC-IP as a local IP adjacency and triggers EVPN RT-2
       advertisement for this MAC-IP across the overlay with new
       reachability via PE2.

     o Following a host move from PE1 to PE2, once PE1 receives a MAC 
       or MAC-IP route from PE2 with a higher sequence number, an ARP
       probe is triggered at PE1 to clear the stale local MAC-IP
       neighbor adjacency OR re-learn the local MAC-IP in case the host
       has moved back or is duplicate.

     o Following a local MAC age-out, if there is a local IP adjacency 
       with this MAC, an ARP probe is triggered for this IP to either
       re-learn the local MAC and maintain local l3 and l2 reachability
       to this host OR to clear the ARP entry in case the host is indeed
       no longer local. Note that clearing of stale ARP entries,
       following a move is required for traffic to converge in the event
       that the host was silent and not discovered at its new location.
       Once stale ARP entry for the host is cleared, routed traffic flow
       destined for the host can re-trigger ARP discovery for this host
       at the new location. ARP flooding on the overlay MUST also be
       done to enable ARP discovery via routed flows.

     o Alternatively, ARP probing timer may be tuned to be smaller than 
       the MAC aging timer to avoid MAC age-out.

   PE-CE control plane learning alternative defined in this document
   decouples host learning following moves from unpredictable host
   behavior with respect to sending data traffic and unsolicited ARPs,

   and as a result from ARP probing and MAC aging timer settings. Host
   move handling is hence greatly simplified to a very predictable and
   deterministic behavior.

13.1.3 ARP Gleaning Latency

   If a CE's ARP binding is not already learned on a PE via an
   unsolicited ARP sent by the CE following events such as boot-up,
   flaps, and moves, a data frame that needs to be routed to the CE
   triggers ARP or ND discovery process on the PE. On a typical hardware
   switching platform, an IP packet that does not resolve to a link
   layer re-write would be punted to host stack that delivers packets
   with incomplete link-layer resolution to ARP or ND for resolution. An
   ARP request / ND Solicitation is generated for the CE IP and an ARP
   response or NA results in installing a link-layer re-write for the CE
   IP. In an EVPN multi-homing environment, this procedure is further
   complicated as the response is only received by one of the PEs that
   may or may not be the one that generated the ARP or ND request.
   Learned neighbor binding is SYNCed to other PEs that share the multi-
   homed Ethernet Segment. Routed flows can now be forwarded to the host
   via all PEs. Latency associated with such data frame driven ARP
   discovery may result in significant initial convergence hit,
   following triggers that warrant re-gleaning of CE IP to MAC binding. 

   PE-CE control plane learning alternative defined in this document
   results in proactive host learning following these scenarios,
   potentially avoiding a convergence hit on initial data packets. 

13.2 Applicability to non-EVPN Use Cases

   While the LSoE based host learning procedure described in this
   document focuses on EVPN-IRB overlay fabric use case, it may also
   have benefits and applicability in non-EVPN use cases. Applicability
   of procedures described in this document to non-EVPN use cases is a
   topic for further study.

14. Summary

   PE-CE control plane is proposed as an alternative to data plane and
   ARP/ND snooping based PE-CE host MAC/IP learning and for PE-CE prefix
   learning. With a PE-CE control plane, CE host MAC and IP are
   deterministically learned on host boot-up, on host configuration,
   across host moves, on convergence triggers such as link failures,
   flaps, and PE re-boots and on all-active multi-homing LAG links. A
   PE-CE control plane decouples CE MAC and IP learning from traffic
   flows sourced by a CE, from varying CE behavior with respect to
   sending unsolicited ARP/ND frames, and from hashing of CE sourced
   frames over all-active multi-homed LAG links. As a result, it helps

   achieve a predictable and reliable convergence behavior across these
   triggers and helps simplify certain EVPN procedures that are
   otherwise needed with a data-plane and ARP/ND snooping based PE-CE
   learning. In addition, it may also be used for non-host learning use
   cases such as prefix learning.
