   Assignment of an Ethertype for IPv6 with RFC 4944, RFC 6282 Header
                                Encoding
                  draft-droms-6lo-ethertype-request-00

Abstract

   When carried over layer 2 technologies such as Ethernet, IPv6
   datagrams using datagram encoding as defined in RFC 4944 and RFC 6282
   must be identified so the receiver can correctly interpret the
   encoded IPv6 datagram.  This document requests the assignment of an
   Ethertype for that purpose.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF has defined a format for IPv6 [RFC2460] datagram encoding in
   [RFC4944] and [RFC6282] (6loENC).  6loENC as defined in RFC 4944 and
   RFC 6282 may be extended and modified by future IETF standards
   document.  The intended layer 2 technology for IPv6 datagrams using
   6loENC as originally defined is [IEEE.802.15.4_2011], which does not
   provide for a protocol switch in its layer 2 headers.

   There is interest in carrying IPv6 datatgrams over layer 2
   technologies that do include a protocol switch field:

   o  Usage of 6loENC in conjunction with IEEE 802.15.9 Multiplexed Data
      Service [IEEE802159], which provides the ability to perform upper
      layer protocol dispatch for IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  Wi-SUN
      Alliance intends to use the 15.9 Multiplexed Data Information
      Element to dispatch 6loENC frames to upper stack layers.  As
      specified in IEEE 802.15.9, dispatch of 6loENC frames will require
      an Ethertype be assigned for 6loENC.

   o  6loENC will likely be needed for WiFi Alliance's HaLoW [HALOW]
      standard (low power operation in the 900 MHz band)

   o  Other layer 2 technologies such as Ethernet and debugging tools
      such as Wireshark require a unique protocol type field for 6loENC
      to properly interpret IPv6 datagrams that use 6loENC.

2.  Request to IEEE for assignment of an Ethertype

   When this document is published, the IETF will formally submit a
   request to IEEE for assignment of an Ethertype for IPv6 datagrams
   using 6loENC.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document is intended only to request assignment of an Ethertype
   for IPv6 datagrams using 6loENC.  It has no incremental implications
   for security beyond those in the relevant protocols.
