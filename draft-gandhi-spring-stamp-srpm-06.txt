Internet-Draft   Using Simple TWAMP for Segment Routing       April 2021


1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
   greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
   (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-
   MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes [RFC8402].  SR takes advantage of
   the Equal-Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  SR
   Policies as defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] are
   used to steer traffic through a specific, user-defined paths using a
   stack of Segments.  Built-in SR Performance Measurement (PM) is one
   of the essential requirements to provide Service Level Agreements
   (SLAs).

   The Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) provides
   capabilities for the measurement of various performance metrics in IP
   networks [RFC8762] without the use of a control channel to pre-signal
   session parameters.  [RFC8972] defines optional extensions for STAMP.
   [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm] augments that framework to define STAMP
   extensions for SR networks.

   This document describes procedures for Performance Measurement in SR
   networks using the mechanisms defined in STAMP [RFC8762] and its
   optional extensions defined in [RFC8972] and further augmented in
   [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm].  The procedure described is applicable
   to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes and is used for both links and end-
   to-end SR paths including SR Policies [RFC8402].

2.2.  Reference Topology

   In the Reference Topology shown below, the STAMP Session-Sender R1
   initiates a STAMP test packet and the STAMP Session-Reflector R3
   transmits a reply test packet.  The reply test packet may be
   transmitted to the STAMP Session-Sender R1 on the same path (same set
   of links and nodes) or a different path in the reverse direction from
   the path taken towards the Session-Reflector.

   The nodes R1 and R3 may be connected via a link or an SR path
   [RFC8402].  The link may be a physical interface, virtual link, or
   Link Aggregation Group (LAG) [IEEE802.1AX], or LAG member link.  The
   SR path may be an SR Policy [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy]
   on node R1 (called head-end) with destination to node R3 (called
   tail-end).

3.  Overview

   For performance measurement in SR networks, the STAMP Session-Sender
   and Session-Reflector test packets defined in [RFC8762] are used.
   They are used in one-way, two-way (i.e. round-trip) and loopback
   measurement modes.  Note that one-way and round-trip are referred to
   in [RFC8762] and are further described in this document because of
   the introduction of loopback measurement mode in SR networks.  The
   procedures defined in this document are also used to infer packet
   loss in SR networks.

   The STAMP test packets are transmitted on the same path as the data
   traffic flow under measurement to measure the delay and packet loss
   experienced by the data traffic flow.

   Typically, the STAMP test packets are transmitted along an IP path
   between a Session-Sender and a Session-Reflector to measure delay and
   packet loss along that IP path.  Matching the forward and reverse
   direction paths for STAMP test packets, even for directly connected
   nodes is not guaranteed.

   It may be desired in SR networks that the same path (same set of
   links and nodes) between the Session-Sender and Session-Reflector be
   used for the STAMP test packets in both directions.  This is achieved
   by using the optional STAMP extensions for SR-MPLS and SRv6 networks
   specified in [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm].  The STAMP Session-
   Reflector uses the return path parameters for the reply test packet
   from the received STAMP test packet, as described in
   [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm].  This way signaling and maintaining
   dynamic SR network state for the STAMP sessions on the Session-
   Reflector are avoided.

   The optional STAMP extensions defined in [RFC8972] are used for
   direct measurement packet loss in SR networks.

   An example of a STAMP reference model with some of the typical
   measurement parameters including the Reflector UDP port for STAMP
   test session is shown in the following Figure 1:

                 STAMP Session-Sender  STAMP Session-Reflector

                  Figure 1: Example STAMP Reference Model

   A reflector UDP port number is selected as described in [RFC8762].
   The same reflector UDP port can be used for STAMP test sessions for
   link and end-to-end SR paths.  In this case, the reflector UDP port
   does not distinguish between link or end-to-end SR path measurements.

   Example of the Timestamp Format is Precision Time Protocol 64-bit
   truncated (PTPv2) [IEEE1588] and Network Time Protocol (NTP).  By
   default, the Session-Reflector replies in kind to the timestamp
   format received in the received Session-Sender test packet, as
   indicated by the "Z" field in the Error Estimate field as described
   in [RFC8762].

   The Session-Reflector mode can be Stateful or Stateless as defined in
   [RFC8762].

   Example of Delay Measurement Mode is one-way, two-way (i.e. round-
   trip) and loopback mode as described in this document.

   Example of Packet Loss Type can be round-trip, near-end (forward) and
   far-end (backward) packet loss as defined in [RFC8762].

   When using the authenticated mode for the STAMP test sessions, the
   matching Authentication Type (e.g.  HMAC-SHA-256) and Key-chain are
   user-configured on STAMP Session-Sender and STAMP Session-Reflector
   [RFC8762].

   The controller shown in the example reference model is not intended
   for the dynamic signaling of the SR parameters for STAMP test
   sessions between the STAMP Session-Sender and STAMP Session-
   Reflector.

   Note that the YANG data model defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-yang]
   can be used to provision the STAMP Session-Sender and STAMP Session-
   Reflector.

4.1.1.  Session-Sender Test Packet for Links

   The STAMP Session-Sender test packet as shown in Figure 2 is
   transmitted over the link under delay measurement.  The local and
   remote IP addresses of the link are used as Source and Destination
   Addresses, respectively.  For IPv6 links, the link local addresses
   [RFC7404] can be used in the IPv6 header.  The Session-Sender may use
   the local Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table, Neighbor

   Solicitation or other bootstrap method to find the IP address for the
   links and refresh.  An IPv4 address from the range 127/8 or IPv6
   loopback address ::1/128 [RFC4291] must not be used to IP route test
   packets in a network.

4.1.2.  Session-Sender Test Packet for SR Paths

   The delay measurement for end-to-end SR path in an SR network is
   applicable to both end-to-end SR-MPLS and SRv6 paths including SR
   Policies.

   The STAMP Session-Sender IPv4 or IPv6 address is used as the Source
   Address.  The SR Policy endpoint IPv4 or IPv6 address is used as the
   Destination Address.

   In the case of Color-Only Destination Steering, with IPv4 endpoint of
   0.0.0.0 or IPv6 endpoint of ::0
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy], the loopback address from
   the range 127/8 for IPv4, or the loopback address ::1/128 for IPv6
   [RFC4291] is used as the Session-Reflector Address, respectively.

4.1.2.1.  Session-Sender Test Packet for SR-MPLS Policies

   An SR-MPLS Policy may contain a number of Segment Lists (SLs).  A
   STAMP Session-Sender test packet is transmitted for each Segment List
   of the SR-MPLS Policy.  The content of an example STAMP Session-
   Sender test packet for an end-to-end SR-MPLS Policy is shown in
   Figure 3.

   The Segment List can be empty in case of a single-hop SR-MPLS Policy
   with Implicit NULL label.

   The Path Segment Identifier (PSID)
   [I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment] of an SR-MPLS Policy can be
   carried in the MPLS header as shown in Figure 3, and can be used for
   direct measurement as described in Section 6, titled "Direct
   Measurement for Links and SR Paths".

4.1.2.2.  Session-Sender Test Packet for SRv6 Policies

   An SRv6 Policy may contain a number of Segment Lists.  A STAMP
   Session-Sender test packet is transmitted for each Segment List of
   the SRv6 Policy.  An SRv6 Policy can contain an SRv6 Segment Routing
   Header (SRH) carrying a Segment List as described in [RFC8754].  The
   content of an example STAMP Session-Sender test packet for an end-to-
   end SRv6 Policy is shown in Figure 4.

   The SRv6 network programming is described in [RFC8986].  The
   procedure defined for Upper-Layer Header processing for SRv6 End SIDs
   in Section 4.1.1 in [RFC8986] is used to process the IPv6/UDP header
   in the received test packets on the Session-Reflector.

              Figure 5: Example Session-Reflector Test Packet

4.2.1.  One-way Measurement Mode

   In one-way delay measurement mode, a reply test packet as shown in
   Figure 5 is transmitted by the STAMP Session-Reflector, for both
   links and end-to-end SR Policies.  The reply test packet may be
   transmitted on the same path or a different path in the reverse
   direction.

   The STAMP Session-Sender address may not be reachable via IP route
   from the STAMP Session-Reflector.  The STAMP Session-Sender in this
   case can send its reachability path information to the STAMP Session-
   Reflector using the Return Path TLV defined in
   [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm].

   In this mode, as per Reference Topology, all timestamps T1, T2, T3,
   and T4 are collected by the test packets.  However, only timestamps
   T1 and T2 are used to measure one-way delay as (T2 - T1).  The one-
   way delay measurement mode requires the clock on the Session-Sender
   and Session-Reflector to be synchronized.

4.2.2.  Two-way Measurement Mode

   In two-way (i.e. round-trip) delay measurement mode, a reply test
   packet as shown in Figure 5 is transmitted by the STAMP Session-
   Reflector on the same path in the reverse direction, e.g. on the
   reverse direction link or associated reverse SR path
   [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path].





Gandhi, et al.          Expires October 31, 2021               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft   Using Simple TWAMP for Segment Routing       April 2021


   For two-way delay measurement mode for links, the STAMP Session-
   Reflector needs to transmit the reply test packet on the same link
   where the test packet is received.  The STAMP Session-Sender can
   request in the test packet to the STAMP Session-Reflector to transmit
   the reply test packet back on the same link using the Control Code
   Sub-TLV in the Return Path TLV defined in
   [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm].

   For two-way delay measurement mode for end-to-end SR paths, the STAMP
   Session-Reflector needs to transmit the reply test packet on a
   specific reverse path.  The STAMP Session-Sender can request in the
   test packet to the STAMP Session-Reflector to transmit the reply test
   packet back on a given reverse path using a Segment List sub-TLV in
   the Return Path TLV defined in [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm].

   In this mode, as per Reference Topology, all timestamps T1, T2, T3,
   and T4 are collected by the test packets.  All four timestamps are
   used to measure two-way delay as ((T4 - T1) - (T3 - T2)).  When clock
   synchronization on the Session-Sender and Session-Reflector nodes is
   not possible, the one-way delay can be derived using two-way delay
   divided by two.

   The content of an example STAMP Session-Reflector reply test packet
   transmitted on the same path as the data traffic flow under
   measurement for two-way delay measurement of an end-to-end SR-MPLS
   Policy is shown in Figure 6.

      Figure 7: Example Session-Reflector Test Packet for SRv6 Policy

4.2.3.  Loopback Measurement Mode

   The STAMP Session-Sender test packets are transmitted in loopback
   mode to measure loopback delay of a bidirectional circular path.  In
   this mode, the received Session-Sender test packets are not punted
   out of the fast path in forwarding (to slow path or control-plane) at
   the STAMP Session-Reflector.  In other words, the Session-Reflector
   does not process them and generate reply test packets.




Gandhi, et al.          Expires October 31, 2021               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft   Using Simple TWAMP for Segment Routing       April 2021


   The IP header of the STAMP Session-Sender test packet contains the
   Destination Address equals to the STAMP Session-Sender address and
   the Source Address equals to the STAMP Session-Reflector address.
   The Session-Sender sets the Reflector UDP port that it uses to
   receive the test packet.  Optionally, the STAMP Session-Sender test
   packet can carry the return path information (e.g.  return path label
   stack for SR-MPLS) as part of the SR header.

   The Session-Sender can use the SSID field in the reply test packet
   and/ or local configuration to know that the test session is using
   the loopback mode.  As the reply test packet is not generated by the
   STAMP Session-Reflector, the STAMP Session-Sender ignores the
   'Session-Sender Sequence Number', 'Session-Sender Timestamp',
   'Session-Sender Error Estimate', and 'Session-Sender TTL' in the
   received test packet.  The Session-Sender sets these fields to 0 upon
   transmission.

   In this mode, as per Reference Topology, the timestamps T1 and T4 are
   collected by the test packets.  Both these timestamps are used to
   measure loopback delay as (T4 - T1).  When STAMP capability on the
   Session-Reflector node is not possible, the one-way delay can be
   derived using loopback delay divided by two.  In this mode, the
   responder node processing time component reflects only the time
   required to loop the test packet from the incoming interface to the
   outgoing interface in forwarding plane.

4.3.  Delay Measurement for P2MP SR Policies

   The Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) SR path that originates from a root
   node terminates on multiple destinations called leaf nodes (e.g.
   P2MP SR Policy [I-D.ietf-pim-sr-p2mp-policy]).

   The procedures for delay and loss measurement described in this
   document for end-to-end P2P SR Policies are also equally applicable
   to the P2MP SR Policies.  The procedure for one-way measurement is
   defined as following:

   o  The STAMP Session-Sender root node transmits test packets using
      the Tree-SID defined in [I-D.ietf-pim-sr-p2mp-policy] for the P2MP
      SR-MPLS Policy as shown in Figure 8.  The STAMP Session-Sender
      test packets may contain the replication SID as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-replication-segment].

   o  The Destination Address is set to the loopback address from the
      range 127/8 for IPv4, or the loopback address ::1/128 for IPv6.

   o  Each STAMP Session-Reflector leaf node transmits its node address
      in the Source Address of the reply test packets shown in Figure 5.

      This allows the STAMP Session-Sender root node to identify the
      STAMP Session-Reflector leaf nodes of the P2MP SR Policy.

   o  The P2MP root node measures the delay for each P2MP leaf node
      individually.

4.4.  Additional STAMP Test Packet Processing Rules

   The processing rules described in this section are applicable to the
   STAMP test packets for links and end-to-end SR paths including SR
   Policies.

4.4.1.  TTL

   The TTL field in the IPv4 and MPLS headers of the STAMP Session-
   Sender and STAMP Session-Reflector test packets is set to 255, except
   in the following cases.

   When using the Session-Reflector IPv4 Address from the range 127/8,
   the TTL field in the IPv4 header is set to 1, for otherwise,
   encapsulated packets.

   For link delay, the TTL field in the STAMP test packet is set to 1 in
   one-way and two-way delay measurement modes.

Internet-Draft   Using Simple TWAMP for Segment Routing       April 2021


4.4.2.  IPv6 Hop Limit

   The Hop Limit field in the IPv6 and SRH headers of the STAMP Session-
   Sender and STAMP Session-Reflector test packets is set to 255, except
   in the following cases.

   When using the Session-Reflector IPv6 Address of loopback address
   ::1/128, the Hop Limit field in the IPv6 header is set to 1, for
   otherwise, encapsulated packets.

   For link delay, the Hop Limit field in the STAMP test packet is set
   to 1 in one-way and two-way delay measurement modes.

4.4.3.  Router Alert Option

   The Router Alert IP option (RAO) [RFC2113] is not set in the STAMP
   test packets for links and end-to-end SR paths.

4.4.4.  UDP Checksum

   For IPv4 test packets, where the hardware is not capable of re-
   computing the UDP checksum or adding checksum complement [RFC7820],
   the Session-Sender may set the UDP checksum value to 0 [RFC8085].

   For IPv6 test packets, where the hardware is not capable of re-
   computing the UDP checksum or adding checksum complement [RFC7820],
   the Session-Sender and Session-Reflector may use the procedure
   defined in [RFC6936] for the UDP checksum.

5.  Packet Loss Measurement for Links and SR Paths

   The procedure described in Section 4 for delay measurement using
   STAMP test packets can be used to detect (test) packet loss for links
   and end-to-end SR paths.  The Sequence Number field in the STAMP test
   packet is used as described in Section 4 "Theory of Operation" where
   Stateful and Stateless Session-Reflector operations are defined
   [RFC8762], to detect round-trip, near-end (forward) and far-end
   (backward) packet loss.

   This method can be used for inferred packet loss measurement,
   however, it does not provide accurate data packet loss metric.

6.  Direct Measurement for Links and SR Paths

   The STAMP "Direct Measurement" TLV (Type 5) defined in [RFC8972] can
   be used in SR networks for data packet loss measurement.  The STAMP
   test packets with this TLV are transmitted using the procedures




Gandhi, et al.          Expires October 31, 2021               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft   Using Simple TWAMP for Segment Routing       April 2021


   described in Section 4 to collect the transmit and receive counters
   of the data flow for the links and end-to-end SR paths.

   The PSID carried in the received data packet for the traffic flow
   under measurement can be used to measure receive data packets (for
   receive traffic counter) for an end-to-end SR path on the STAMP
   Session-Reflector.  The PSID in the received Session-Sender test
   packet header can be used to associate the receive traffic counter on
   the Session-Reflector for the end-to-end SR path.

   The STAMP "Direct Measurement" TLV (Type 5) lacks the support to
   identify the Block Number of the Direct Measurement traffic counters,
   which is required for Alternate-Marking Method [RFC8321] for accurate
   data packet loss metric.

7.  Session State for Links and SR Paths

   The STAMP test session state allows to know if the performance
   measurement test is active.  The threshold-based notification may not
   be generated if the delay values do not change significantly.  For an
   unambiguous monitoring, the controller needs to distinguish the cases
   whether the performance measurement is active, or delay values are
   not changing to cross threshold.

   The STAMP test session state initially is declared active when one or
   more reply test packets are received at the STAMP Session-Sender.
   The STAMP test session state is declared idle (or failed) when
   consecutive N number of reply test packets are not received at the
   STAMP Session-Sender, where N is locally provisioned value.

8.  ECMP Support for SR Policies

   An SR Policy can have ECMPs between the source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.
   Usage of Anycast SID [RFC8402] by an SR Policy can result in ECMP
   paths via transit nodes part of that Anycast group.  The test packets
   need to be transmitted to traverse different ECMP paths to measure
   end-to-end delay of an SR Policy.

   Forwarding plane has various hashing functions available to forward
   packets on specific ECMP paths.  The mechanisms described in
   [RFC8029] and [RFC5884] for handling ECMPs are also applicable to the
   delay measurement.

   In IPv4 header of the STAMP Session-Sender test packets, sweeping of
   Session-Reflector Address from the range 127/8 can be used to
   exercise ECMP paths.  In this case, both the forward and the return
   paths must be SR-MPLS paths when using the loopback mode.

   As specified in [RFC6437], Flow Label field in the outer IPv6 header
   can also be used for sweeping to exercise different IPv6 ECMP paths.

   The "Destination Node Address" TLV [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm] can
   be carried in the STAMP Session-Sender test packet to identify the
   intended Session-Reflector, for example, in case of using IPv4
   Session-Reflector Address from 127/8 range when the STAMP test packet
   is encapsulated by a tunneling protocol or an MPLS Segment list.  The
   STAMP Session-Reflector must not transmit reply test packet if it is
   not the intended destination node in the "Destination Node Address"
   TLV [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm].

9.  Security Considerations

   The performance measurement is intended for deployment in well-
   managed private and service provider networks.  As such, it assumes
   that a node involved in a measurement operation has previously
   verified the integrity of the path and the identity of the far-end
   STAMP Session-Reflector.

   If desired, attacks can be mitigated by performing basic validation
   and sanity checks, at the STAMP Session-Sender, of the counter or
   timestamp fields in received measurement reply test packets.  The
   minimal state associated with these protocols also limits the extent
   of measurement disruption that can be caused by a corrupt or invalid
   packet to a single test cycle.

   Use of HMAC-SHA-256 in the authenticated mode protects the data
   integrity of the test packets.  SRv6 has HMAC protection
   authentication defined for SRH [RFC8754].  Hence, test packets for
   SRv6 may not need authentication mode.  Cryptographic measures may be
   enhanced by the correct configuration of access-control lists and
   firewalls.

   The security considerations specified in [RFC8762] and [RFC8972] also
   apply to the procedures described in this document.

   When using the procedures defined in [RFC6936], the security
   considerations specified in [RFC6936] also apply.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA action.
