Internet Draft       IPsec Flow Monitoring MIB         3 Mar 2003


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   As VPN technology in the shape of IPsec is deployed, customers,
   particularly large enterprise and Service Providers, are requiring a
   standard way to monitor their VPNs. Service Providers in particular
   are often required to maintain service level agreements (SLAs) that
   guarantee quality and performance to their customers. In addition to
   this the provider must be able to accurately bill customers. Both
   enterprise customers and providers collect usage statistics for
   capacity planning and to ensure sufficient resources are available
   for redundancy and high availability.

   This document defines a high level MIB for monitoring, trending
   and troubleshooting IPsec connections. The metrics defined by thi
   MIB may be used to identify trends and enforce service level
   agreements. The troubleshooting functionality is in the form of
   records of failure events and traps sent as a result of operational
   failures during the setting up, tearing down and normal lifetime of
   IPsec flows. It is meant as an indication of failure to the personnel
   of a Network Operation Center. This MIB does not present in-depth low
   level debugging and diagnostic support that may be used by
   implementers of IPsec, but rather, it may be seen as complementary to
   such a MIB. This MIB does not provide support for the configuration
   of IPsec-capable devices.

   The definition presented is driven by customer requirements for a MIB
   encompassing statistics collection that may be used for accounting
   purposes, trending as well as status monitoring, error collection and
   real-time alerting via traps.

   The MIB has been designed based on specific requirements from service
   providers that want to offer an outsourced VPN service to customers,
   with the main focuses being: provision of services in such a way that
   satisfies Service Level Agreements, support for a multi-vendor
   environment, and incorporation with existing network management
   software.

   The MIB was designed in 1999 and has since evolved with the
   experience in its deployment in the field. While the MIB is likely
   to be deployed for managing IPsec VPNs, the MIB is not specifi
   to this application of IPsec. The MIB may be used equally well t
   manage any IPsec-based network.

   Section 2 describes the architecture and abstractions defined by the
   MIB. This section is important for understanding the remaining

   sections.

   Section 3 describes various object groups defined in the MIB. These
   include the Levels group, the IPsec Phase-1 group, IPsec Phase-2
   group, the history group, the VPN failure group and finally the
   notifications group. Important relationships between the groups have
   also been highlighted.

   Section 4 lists the items that are planned to be included in the MI
   in the next revision.

   Section 5 defines a collection of managed objects used to instrument
   IPsec structures and activities in the managed entity.

   Sections 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 are administrative in nature.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   1) An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [2271].

   2) Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in RFC
      1155 [1155], RFC 1212 [1212] and RFC 1215 [1215]. The second
      version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [1902],RFC 1903
      [1903] and RFC 1904 [1904].

   3) Message protocols for transferring management information. The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in RFC 1157 [1157]. A second version of the SNMP message
      protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
      called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [1901] and RFC 1906
      [1906].  The third version of the message protocol is called
      SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [1906], RFC 2272 [2272] and RFC
      2274 [2274].

   4) Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in RFC 1157 [1157]. A second set of protocol operations
      and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [1905].

Internet Draft       IPsec Flow Monitoring MIB         3 Mar 2003



   5) A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [2273] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
      [2275].


2.  Architecture of the MIB

   This section provides a view of the overall architecture, and
   describes the major MIB groups and table definitions. The MIB covers
   both Phase 1 Security Associations (SAs) and Phase 2 or IPsec SAs.
   An example of Phase 1 structures are the SAs created by the Interne
   Key Exchange (IKE) protocol.

   The key component of this MIB is the abstraction of a traffic flow or
   a "tunnel". A tunnel signifies a sustained application traffic flow.
   A Phase 1 tunnel (IKE tunnel) is represented by a single ISAKMP SA
   which has been established after a successful completion of Phase 1.
   When the ISAKMP SA expires or is terminated, the tunnel is deeme
   to cease to exist as well.

      (ISAKMP SA                                      (ISAKMP SA
           created)                                        expires)
           |<----------------[ISAKMP SA]------------------>|

           |<--------------- Phase 1 Tunnel -------------->|


   In the context of Phase 2 SAs, an "IPsec tunnel" is defined as the
   virtual link formed by successsive Phase 2 SA bundles that share the
   same Phase 2 proxy identifiers. When the last SA budle expires and is
   not replaced by a new set of SA bundle, the tunnel is said to expire.

    (Start of application
           traffic)
           [SA bundle 1]----->|
                           [SA bundle 2]----->|
                                           [SA bundle 3]----->|
                                                           (End of
                                                            application
                                                            traffic)
           |<---------------- Phase 2 Tunnel ---------------->|


   Another key component of this MIB is the monitoring of large numbers
   of dynamic tunnels. In the case of clients initiating connections to
   a gateway, it is not usually possible for the gateway to have



IPsec Working Group        Expires September 2003       [Page 5]

Internet Draft       IPsec Flow Monitoring MIB         3 Mar 2003


   knowledge of all the attributes of the client, in particular the
   identity of the client, before the start of the session. The MIB must
   support these dynamic connections in addition to static tunnels that
   usually exist between gateway devices.

   The information provided in the MIB includes statistics on individual
   SAs as well as global totals which  allows the provider to report on
   individual customer SLAs as well as monitoring the overall health of
   the VPN service. Statistics are provided on packet counts and drops,
   notify messages, failures, deletes and exchanges between peers. This
   information is presented in the form of groups that cover specific
   aspects of the VPN to facilitate accurate evaluation of performance
   and the generation of meaningful reports.

2.1  Support for Different Control Protocols

   This document uses the term Control Protocol to denote the protocol
   used to setup and maintain the IPsec (Phase 2) SAs. The architecture
   of the MIB supports the instrumentation of any control protocol. Th
   current version of the MIB defines an IKE group to support th
   deployment of IPsec with IKE. This is an optional group and henc
   need not be implemented to claim compliance with the MIB. As newe
   control protocols are standardized (IKEv2, KINK, etc), the module
   for these protocols can be plugged into this MIB as other optiona
   groups.


3.  MIB Group Definitions

   This section outlines the major MIB groups and table definitions. The
   MIB covers both Phase 1 or Internet key Exchange SAs and Phase 2 or
   IPsec SAs.

3.1.  IPsec Levels Group

   The Levels Group consists of global single instance objects accessed
   using an index of zero. Currently, the MIB Level object is the only
   object contained in this group. Initially the value of this object
   will be one (1) and incremented as changes are made to the MIB.

3.2.  IPsec Phase-1 Group

   Provides global statistics for all phase 1 tunnels, active and
   previous. The Internet Key Exchange Peer Table defines the peers
   involved in any Phase 1 tunnel associated with active Phase 2
   tunnels. Statistics for each active phase 1 tunnel (including policy
   attributes) are contained in the IKE Tunnel table, and the IKE Peer

   Association to Phase 2 Tunnel Correlation Table provides a link
   between each Phase 1 peer entry and any associated active Phase 2
   tunnels.

      ikeGlobalStats

        All Phase 1 Tunnel Stats including statistics pertaining to
        IKE mode configuration.

                                            IkePeerCorrEntry
                                              -----> ipSecTunnelTable
                                                       IpSecTunnelEntry


   The relationships modeled in Phase-1 group are as follows:

          .--------------.             .----------------.
          |   Phase1     |             |Control Protocol|
          |    Peer      |---------->> | (IKE) Tunnel   |
          |   Table      |             |    Table       |
          `--------------'             `----------------'
                 ^                            ^
                 ^                            ^
                 |                            .
	         |                            .
          .--------------.             .--------------.
          | Phase1 Peer  |             |    IPsec     |
          | Correlation  |-----------> |    Tunnel    |
          |   Table      |             |    Table     |
          `--------------'             `--------------'

   Single arrow (>) represents a 1:1 relation. Double arrow represents
   a 1:n relationship. Dotted arrow (...) represents a relationship
   that is defined as a "softlink", i.e., a relationship that is
   implemented in the software but which is not enforced by SMI. The
   relationship between an IPsec tunnel and the Control tunnel that
   negotiated that IPsec tunnel is implemented using a softlink i
   order to facilitate "dangling" IPsec implementations (i.e.
   implementations where an ISAKMP SA may expire prior to the expiry o
   the Phase-2 SAs that were negotiated using the ISAKMP SA). Note tha
   control tunnel types other than IKE can be accomodated using thi
   architecture.

   As the diagram above illustrates, there can be one or more IKE
   tunnels between a Phase 1 peer pair. There can be one or more IPsec
   tunnels between a given Phase 1 peer pair. When there are no Control
   (such as IKE) or IPsec tunnels to a peer, the peer entr
   corresponding to that peer is removed from the Phase 1 Peer table.


3.3.  IPsec Phase-2 Group

   This group defines six subgroups. The first is a Global Statistics
   table that accumulates statistics pertaining to various Phase-2
   activities and tunnel statistics from all active and previous Phase 2
   tunnels. The second group defines the active Phase 2 IPsec tunnel
   table. Each entry in this table corresponds to a single active
   Phase-2 IPsec flow on the managed entity and includes the algorithms
   used and counts of activities such as number of packets successfully
   encrypted or number of encryption failures. The tunnel endpoint table
   forms the third subgroup under Phase 2 group. This table identifies
   the clients using the active IPsec flows and the protocols riding on
   the flows. The clients are subnets, hosts or collection of IP
   addresses. The protocol for which the flow as setup is identified
   using the id of the protocol and the port number (eg: SMTP = TCP/25).
   Since endpoints are associated with active IPsec tunnels, each entry
   in te endpoint table refers to an entry in the active IPsec tunnel
   table.

   The fourth subgroup under Phase-2 group is  the IPsec security
   association table (ipSecSaTable). This table identifies the structure
   of each active IPsec tunnel by mapping the active IPsec tunnel into
   its component security associations. This table deprecates the
   previously defined ipSecSpiTable.

   The relationships modeled in Phase-1 group are as follows:

          .----------------.
          |Control Protocol|
          |  (IKE) Tunnel  |
          |   Table        |
          `----------------'
                 ^
                 ^
                 .
                 .
          .--------------.             .--------------.
          |   IPsec      |             |   End Point  |
          |   Tunnel     |<----------- |    Table     |
          |   Table      |             |              |
          `--------------'             `--------------'
                 ^
                 ^
                 |
                 |
          .--------------.
          |    IPsec     |
          |     SA       |
          |    Table     |
          `--------------'


   As the diagram above illustrates, for every entry in the End Point
   table, there is a unique entry in the active IPsec tunnel table.  A
   number of entries in the IPsec SA table map to a specific entry in t
   he IPsec tunnel table. This is because an IPsec tunnel is composed of
   at least two Phase-2 security associations. Note also, that th
   relationshop between Phase-2 IPsec tunnels and Phase 2 IKE tunnels is
   n:1 and is implemented as a softlink, to accomodate dangling IPsec
   implementations.


3.4.  IPsec History Group

   This group includes tables for Phase-1 Tunnel History, Phase-2 Tunnel
   History, and Phase-2 Endpoint History. The number of entries in each
   table defined by the value of ipSecHistTablSize. The tables cover
   phase 1 and phase 2 statistics  based on accumulating packet and
   octet counts and failures based on security policy parameters and
   tunnel lifetimes. Examples are a count of the total number of octets



IPsec Working Group        Expires September 2003       [Page 9]

   encrypted using 3DES, or the number of authentication failures when
   the algorithm used was MD5.

   The relationships modeled in Phase-1 group are as follows:

          .--------------.
          | IKE Tunnel   |
          |   History    |
          |   Table      |
          `--------------'
                 ^
                 ^
                 .
                 .
                 .
          .--------------.             .--------------.
          | IPsec Tunnel |             |   Phase 2    |
          |  History     | <---------- |   EndPoint   |
          |   Table      |             | History Table|
          `--------------'             `--------------'


   For every entry in the End Point History table, there is a unique
   entry in the IPsec Tunnel History table. This is because when an
   IPsec tunnel expires, the end point entry associated with the tunnel
   expires also. Also note that the IKE tunnel that negotiated an
   expired instance of IPsec tunnel may not be present in the IKE Tunnel
   History table; the IKE tunnel may instead be still in the active IKE
   tunnel table.

   Implementation Hint: The failure group may be implemented using ring
   buffers of the prescribed maximum size. This will automatically cause
   the oldest entry to be phased out to accomodate a new entry, should
   the buffer be full.


3.4.1.  Journaling Active Tunnels

   The history group also allows for journaling active Phase 1 and Phase
   2 sessions by taking a snapshot of the active tunnels into the
   respective history tables whenever required. By setting an
   appropriate value in the MIB object ipSecHistCheckPoint, the operator
   may initiate a snapshot operation.


3.5.  IPsec Failure Group




IPsec Working Group        Expires September 2003       [Page 10]

Internet Draft       IPsec Flow Monitoring MIB         3 Mar 2003


   This group includes tables for phase 1 and phase 2 failures. Failures
   include

   1) tunnel setup failures (the failure of a tunnel to be setup)

   2) tunnel operational failures (the tunnel was setip, but was
      terminated before the negotiated lifetime expired).

   The size of each table is dependent on the value of the ipSecFailTa-
   bleSize object. Each failure entry for either phase 1 or 2 includes
   the specific reason for the failure, for example a CRL failure, and
   the time of the failure.

   There are two tables in the failure group - one corresponding to
   failure of Phase-1 operations (IKE failures) and the second
   correspondign to Phase-2 failures. There is no specific relationship
   between the two tables modeled in this group.  Note, however, that
   for every tunnel failure recorded in the failure group, there is an
   entry in the corresponding (IKE or IPsec) Tunnel History table
   (unless such an entry has been phased out to accomodate a new entry).

   Implementation Hint: The failure group may be implemented using ring
   buffers of the prescribed maximum size. This will automatically cause
   the oldest entry to be phased out to accomodate a new entry, should
   the buffer be full.


3.6.  IPsec Trap Control Group

   This group controls the sending of IPsec traps. Traps are considered
   to include both error conditions, and any events that cause a change
   in state on the device. Events that trigger traps include normal
   events such as tunnel starts and stops and failure events such as
   early tunnel terminations, receipt of an invalid SPI, system errors,
   failure to establish tunnels, certificate failures and protocol
   errors.


4.  Elements Deferred to Future Versions

   A number of information elements relevant to the management of
   IPsec-based VPNs have been postponed to the next revision of this
   document. These include the following.

   1) Support for Stream Control Transmission Protocol Apart from the
      inclusion of a new IKE ID type, SCTP requires that an IKE/IPsec
      tunnel be able to support multiple endpoint entries (selectors).

Internet Draft       IPsec Flow Monitoring MIB         3 Mar 2003


      Hence the mapping between IPsec tunnel table and the End Point
      table must be made 1:n.

   2) Support for KINK As details pertaining to KINK are resolved, Phase
      1 group in the MIB will be redefined to support multiple key
      management protocols.

   3) Multicast/GDOI A future version if this MIB will include support
      for group key-negotiations and multicast over IPsec.

   4) NAT with IPsec Many implementations use UDP encapsulation to
      support NAT with IPsec. The Phase-1 and Phase-2 tunnel tables will
      be expanded to include attributes pertaining to this
      configuration.

    DESCRIPTION
         "This is a MIB Module for monitoring the structure
      and status of IPSec-based networks. The MIB has bee
      designed to be adopted as an IETF standard. Henc
      vendor-specific features of IPSec protocol are exclude
      from this MIB.

      Acronyms
      The following acronyms are used in this document:

       IPSec:      Secure IP Protocol

       VPN:        Virtual Private Network

       ISAKMP:     Internet Security Association and Key Exchange
                   Protocol

       IKE:        Internet Key Exchange Protocol

       SA:         Security Association

       MM:         Main Mode - the process of setting up
                   a Phase 1 SA to secure the exchanges
                   required to setup Phase 2 SAs

Internet Draft       IPsec Flow Monitoring MIB         3 Mar 2003


       QM:         Quick Mode - the process of setting up
                   Phase 2 Security Associations using
                   a Phase 1 SA.

       Phase 1 Tunnel:
                   An ISAKMP SA can be regarded as representing
                   a flow of ISAKMP/IKE traffic. Hence an ISAKMP
                   is referred to as a 'Phase 1 Tunnel' in this
                   document

       Control Tunnel:
                   Another term for a Phase 1 Tunnel.

       Phase 2 Tunnel:
                   AN instance of a non-ISAKMP SA  bundle in which all
                   the SA share the same proxy identifiers (IDii,IDir)
                   protect the same stream of application traffic.
                   Such an SA bundle is termed a 'Phase 2 Tunnel'.
                   Note that a Phase 2 tunnel may comprise different
                   SA bundles and different number of SA bundles at
                   different times (due to key refresh).


       Overview of IPsec MIB

    The MIB contains six major groups of objects which are
    used to manage the IPSec Protocol. These groups include
    a Levels Group, a Phase-1 Group, a Phase-2 Group,
    a History Group, a Failure Group and a TRAP Control Group.
    The following table illustrates the structure of the
    IPSec MIB.

    The Phase 1 group models objects pertaining to
    IKE negotiations and Phase 1 tunnels.

    The Phase 2 group models objects pertaining to
    IPSec data tunnels.

    The History group is to aid applications that do
    trending analysis.

    The Failure group is to enable an operator to
    do troubleshooting and debugging of the VPN Router.
    Further, counters are supported to aid detection
    of potential security violations.

    In addition to the five major MIB Groups, there are

    a number of Notifications. The following table
    illustrates the name and description of the
    IPSec TRAPs.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document describes how a management station can monitor
   structure and acivity of IPsec based VPNs. Applications have access
   to data which is not secured.  Applications SHOULD take reasonable
   steps to protect the data from disclosure.

   This document also contains a MIB definition module. The information
   contained in this MIB describes a VPN service whose variables may be
   read and in some cases set.

   It is important that access to the MIB is limited to the appropriate
   users, and that information exchanges between users, management
   stations, agents and any other devices is provided via a secure
   mechanism such as an encrypted session.
