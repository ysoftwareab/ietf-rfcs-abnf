                  Host Identity Protocol Certificates
                     draft-ietf-hip-rfc6253-bis-06

Abstract

   The Certificate (CERT) parameter is a container for digital
   certificates.  It is used for carrying these certificates in Host
   Identity Protocol (HIP) control packets.  This document specifies the
   certificate parameter and the error signaling in case of a failed
   verification.  Additionally, this document specifies the
   representations of Host Identity Tags in X.509 version 3 (v3).

   The concrete use cases of certificates, including how certificates
   are obtained, requested, and which actions are taken upon successful
   or failed verification, are specific to the scenario in which the
   certificates are used.  Hence, the definition of these scenario-
   specific aspects is left to the documents that use the CERT
   parameter.

   This document updates RFC7401 and obsoletes RFC6253.

1.  Introduction

   Digital certificates bind pieces of information to a public key by
   means of a digital signature, and thus, enable the holder of a
   private key to generate cryptographically verifiable statements.  The
   Host Identity Protocol (HIP) [RFC7401] defines a new cryptographic
   namespace based on asymmetric cryptography.  The identity of each
   host is derived from a public key, allowing hosts to digitally sign
   data and issue certificates with their private key.  This document
   specifies the CERT parameter, which is used to transmit digital
   certificates in HIP.  It fills the placeholder specified in
   Section 5.2 of [RFC7401], and thus, updates [RFC7401].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

2.  CERT Parameter

   The CERT parameter is a container for certain types of digital
   certificates.  It does not specify any certificate semantics.
   However, it defines supplementary parameters that help HIP hosts to
   transmit semantically grouped CERT parameters in a more systematic
   way.  The specific use of the CERT parameter for different use cases
   is intentionally not discussed in this document.  Hence, the use of
   the CERT parameter will be defined in the documents that use the CERT
   parameter.

   The CERT parameter is covered and protected, when present, by the HIP
   SIGNATURE field and is a non-critical parameter.

   The CERT parameter can be used in all HIP packets.  However, using it
   in the first Initiator (I1) packet is NOT RECOMMENDED because it can
   increase the processing times of I1s, which can be problematic when
   processing storms of I1s.  Each HIP control packet MAY contain
   multiple CERT parameters.  These parameters MAY be related or
   unrelated.  Related certificates are managed in Cert groups.  A Cert
   group specifies a group of related CERT parameters that SHOULD be
   interpreted in a certain order (e.g., for expressing certificate
   chains).  Ungrouped certificates exhibit a unique Cert group field
   and set the Cert count to 1.  CERT parameters with the same Cert
   group number in the group field indicate a logical grouping.  The
   Cert count field indicates the number of CERT parameters in the
   group.

   CERT parameters that belong to the same Cert group MAY be contained
   in multiple sequential HIP control packets.  This is indicated by a
   higher Cert count than the amount of CERT parameters with matching
   Cert group fields in a HIP control packet.  The CERT parameters MUST
   be placed in ascending order, within a HIP control packet, according
   to their Cert group field.  Cert groups MAY only span multiple
   packets if the Cert group does not fit the packet.  A HIP packet MUST
   NOT contain more than one incomplete Cert group that continues in the
   next HIP control packet.

   The Cert ID acts as a sequence number to identify the certificates in
   a Cert group.  The numbers in the Cert ID field MUST start from 1 up
   to Cert count.

   The Cert Group and Cert ID namespaces are managed locally by each
   host that sends CERT parameters in HIP control packets.

     Cert ID       The sequence number for this certificate
     Cert Type     Indicates the type of the certificate
     Padding       Any Padding, if necessary, to make the TLV a multiple
                   of 8 bytes.


   The certificates MUST use the algorithms defined in [RFC7401] as the
   signature and hash algorithms.

   The following certificate types are defined:

             +--------------------------------+-------------+
             |          Cert format           | Type number |
             +--------------------------------+-------------+
             |            Reserved            |      0      |
             |            X.509 v3            |      1      |
             |    Hash and URL of X.509 v3    |      2      |
             |      LDAP URL of X.509 v3      |      3      |
             | Distinguished Name of X.509 v3 |      4      |
             +--------------------------------+-------------+

   The next sections outline the use of Host Identity Tags (HITs) in
   X.509 v3.  X.509 v3 certificates and the handling procedures are
   defined in [RFC5280].  The wire format for X.509 v3 is the
   Distinguished Encoding Rules format as defined in [X.690].

   Hash and Uniform Resource Locator (URL) encodings (3 and 4) are used
   as defined in Section 3.6 of [RFC7296].  Using hash and URL encodings
   results in smaller HIP control packets than by including the
   certificate(s), but requires the receiver to resolve the URL or check
   a local cache against the hash.

   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) URL encodings (5 and 6)
   are used as defined in [RFC4516].  Using LDAP URL encoding results in
   smaller HIP control packets but requires the receiver to retrieve the
   certificate or check a local cache against the URL.

   Distinguished Name (DN) encodings (7 and 8) are represented by the
   string representation of the certificate's subject DN as defined in
   [RFC4514].  Using the DN encoding results in smaller HIP control
   packets, but requires the receiver to retrieve the certificate or
   check a local cache against the DN.

3.  X.509 v3 Certificate Object and Host Identities

   If needed, HITs can represent an issuer, a subject, or both in X.509
   v3.  HITs are represented as IPv6 addresses as defined in [RFC7343].
   When the Host Identifier (HI) is used to sign the certificate, the
   respective HIT SHOULD be placed into the Issuer Alternative Name
   (IAN) extension using the GeneralName form iPAddress as defined in
   [RFC5280].  When the certificate is issued for a HIP host, identified
   by a HIT and HI, the respective HIT SHOULD be placed into the Subject
   Alternative Name (SAN) extension using the GeneralName form
   iPAddress, and the full HI is presented as the subject's public key
   info as defined in [RFC5280].

   The following examples illustrate how HITs are presented as issuer
   and subject in the X.509 v3 extension alternative names.

       Format of X509v3 extensions:
           X509v3 Issuer Alternative Name:
               IP Address:hit-of-issuer
           X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
               IP Address:hit-of-subject

       Example X509v3 extensions:
           X509v3 Issuer Alternative Name:
               IP Address:2001:24:6cf:fae7:bb79:bf78:7d64:c056
           X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
               IP Address:2001:2c:5a14:26de:a07c:385b:de35:60e3

   Appendix A shows a full example X.509 v3 certificate with HIP
   content.

   As another example, consider a managed Public Key Infrastructure
   (PKI) environment in which the peers have certificates that are
   anchored in (potentially different) managed trust chains.  In this
   scenario, the certificates issued to HIP hosts are signed by
   intermediate Certification Authorities (CAs) up to a root CA.  In
   this example, the managed PKI environment is neither HIP aware, nor
   can it be configured to compute HITs and include them in the
   certificates.

   When HIP communications are established, the HIP hosts not only need
   to send their identity certificates (or pointers to their
   certificates), but also the chain of intermediate CAs (or pointers to
   the CAs) up to the root CA, or to a CA that is trusted by the remote
   peer.  This chain of certificates SHOULD be sent in a Cert group as
   specified in Section 2.  The HIP peers validate each other's
   certificates and compute peer HITs based on the certificate public
   keys.

4.  Revocation of Certificates

   Revocation of X.509 v3 certificates is handled as defined in
   Section 5 of [RFC5280].

5.  Error Signaling

   If the Initiator does not send the certificate that the Responder
   requires, the Responder may take actions (e.g. reject the
   connection).  The Responder MAY signal this to the Initiator by
   sending a HIP NOTIFY message with NOTIFICATION parameter error type
   CREDENTIALS_REQUIRED.

   If the verification of a certificate fails, a verifier MAY signal
   this to the provider of the certificate by sending a HIP NOTIFY
   message with NOTIFICATION parameter error type INVALID_CERTIFICATE.

     NOTIFICATION PARAMETER - ERROR TYPES     Value
     ------------------------------------     -----

     CREDENTIALS_REQUIRED                      48

     The Responder is unwilling to set up an association,
     as the Initiator did not send the needed credentials.

     INVALID_CERTIFICATE                       50

     Sent in response to a failed verification of a certificate.
     Notification Data MAY contain n (n calculated from the
     NOTIFICATION parameter length) groups of Cert group and
     Cert ID octets (in this order) of the CERT parameter that
     caused the failure.

6.  IANA Considerations

   As this document obsoletes [RFC6253], references to [RFC6253] in IANA
   registries have to be replaced by references to this document.  This
   document changes Certificate type registry in Section 2.

7.  Security Considerations

   Certificate grouping allows the certificates to be sent in multiple
   consecutive packets.  This might allow similar attacks, as IP-layer
   fragmentation allows, for example, the sending of fragments in the
   wrong order and skipping some fragments to delay or stall packet
   processing by the victim in order to use resources (e.g., CPU or
   memory).  Hence, hosts SHOULD implement mechanisms to discard
   certificate groups with outstanding certificates if state space is
   scarce.

   Although, CERT parameter is allowed in the first Initiator (I1)
   packet it is NOT RECOMMENDED because it can increase the processing
   times of I1s, which can be problematic when processing storms of I1s.
   Furthermore, Initiator has to take into consideration that the
   Responder can drop the CERT parameter in I1 without processing the
   parameter.

   Checking of the URL and LDAP entries might allow denial-of-service
   (DoS) attacks, where the target host may be subjected to bogus work.

   Security considerations for X.509 v3 are discussed in [RFC5280].
