Abstract

   This document describes an extension to the RADIUS protocol that
   performs authentication, authorization, and accounting for Quality-
   of-Service reservations.

Internet-Draft      RADIUS Quality of Service Support          July 2005


   The described extensions allow network elements to authenticate the
   initiator of a reservation request (if desired), to ensure that the
   reservation is authorized, and to account for established QoS
   resources.

   Flexibility is provided by offering support for different
   authorization models and by decoupling specific QoS attributes
   carried in the QoS signaling protocol from the AAA protocol.  This
   document is the RADIUS complement to the DIAMETER QoS application.

1.  Introduction

   To meet the quality-of-service needs of applications such as voice-
   over-IP, it will often be necessary to explicitly request resources
   from the network.  This will allow the network to identify packets
   belonging to these application flows and ensure that bandwidth,
   delay, and error rate requirements are met.

   This document is a complement to the ongoing work of the DIAMETER QoS
   application described in [12].  It describes RADIUS protocol
   extensions supporting AAA in an environment where better than best
   effort Quality of Service is desired.  The suggested extensions to
   the RFC 2865 [1], RFC 2866 [2], RFC 2869 [3] and RFC 3576 [4] satisfy
   the requirements defined in [13].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [5].

3.  Goals

   This document has a few ambitious goals, namely:

   o  Decouple the QoS signaling protocol (such as NSIS, RSVP or link
      layer QoS signaling protocols) from the AAA protocol.  This goal
      is accomplished with the help of a generic QoS description, the
      QSPEC object.

   o  Support for different scenarios that demand authorization for QoS
      reservations.  The impact is to provide flexibility with regard to
      the entities that trigger the QoS reservation, the QoS parameters
      that need to be provided to the RADIUS server for authorization,
      the granularity of the QoS reservation (e.g., for an individual
      application flow, for an aggregate).

4.  QoS Authorization for a Session

   A request from a Quality of Service enabled RADIUS clietn starts a
   RADIUS message exchange.  The identity of the user, and depending on
   the scenario, the identity of the QoS authorizing application server
   and optional session identification information, are assembled into a
   RADIUS Access-Request message by the AAA client responsible for
   resource allocation and sent to a AAA server either co-located with
   an application server, to the local AAA server or to the RADIUS
   server in the user's home realm.

   If the authentication procedure involves multiple Access-Requests (as
   in EAP), the RADIUS client MUST include the QoS-attributes in at
   least the last Access-Request of the authentication procedure.

   The server processes the information and responds with a RADIUS
   Access-Accept message, which contains the QoS authorization result,
   accounting and bearer gating information.  Also, the value of the
   Session-Timeout attribute is set to the duration of the session, the
   value of the "Termination-Action" attribute is set and the "State"
   attribute MUST be included as stated in [1].

   If the authorization decision at the RADIUS server indiates that the
   request cannot be completed successfully then an Access-Reject
   message containing the Reply-Message attribute with the reason for
   rejection.

4.1  Session Establishment

   When the QoS authorization exchange completes successfully, an RADIUS
   Accounting session SHOULD start for reporting accounting information
   and loss of bearer.  Accounting information is reported as described
   in [2] and [3].  Loss of bearer information is reported using Access-
   Request message.

4.2  QoS Re-Authorization

4.2.1  Client-side initiated Re-Authorization

   The "Authorize-ONLY" Access-Request MUST NOT include either User
   Password or a CHAP Password.  In order to protect the RADIUS message,
   the RADIUS client MUST include the Message-Authenticator(80)
   attribute.  The RADIUS client will compute the value for the Message-
   Authenticator based on [3].

   The RADIUS server processes the information including the
   verification of the Message-Authenticator(80) as per [3] and responds
   with a RADIUS Access-Accept message which contains the "Service-Type"

   (6) attribute with value "Authorize-ONLY", QoS authorization,
   accounting, bearer gating information, and the "State" attribute with
   new value or a Access-Reject message containing the Reply-Message
   attribute with the reason of rejection.

4.2.2  Server-side initiated Re-Authorization

   At any time during the QoS session the RAIDUS server MAY send a
   Change-of-Authorization (CoA) message with the "Service-Type" (6)
   attribute with the value "Authorize-ONLY".  The RADIUS client MUST
   respond with a Change-of-Authorization NACK message with the
   "Service-Type" (6) attribute with the value "Authorize-ONLY" and the
   Error-Cause attribute with value "Request-Initiated".  The RADIUS
   client MUST then send an Access-Request containing "Service-Type" (6)
   attribute with value "Authorize-ONLY" and re-authorization
   information.  This approach is compatible with the DIAMETER re-
   authorization procedure and is defined in RFC 3576 [4].  Furthermore,
   the "State" attribute SHOULD be used as specified in RFC 3576 [4].

4.3  Session Termination

4.3.1  Client-side initiated session termination

   A QoS session may be terminated from the client side by sending a
   Access-Request message with unchanged "State" attribute received from
   the RADIUS server.  This action is defined in [6].

4.3.2  Server-side initiated session termination

   At anytime during a session the Authorizing Server may send a
   Disconnect message to terminate a session.  This capability is
   described in detail in RFC 3576 [4].  The RADIUS server sends a
   Disconnect message that MUST contain identifiers that uniquely
   identify the subscribers data session and the RADIUS client serving
   that session and the "Service-Type" (6) attribute with value
   "Authorize-ONLY".

   If the RADIUS client receives a Disconnect message, it MUST respond
   with the Disconnect-NACK message with "Service-Type" (6) attribute
   with value "Authorize-ONLY" and Error-Cause attribute with the value
   "Request-Initiated".  If it is able to terminate the session it will
   send Access-Request message with "Service-Type" (6) attribute with
   value "Authorize-ONLY" and attributes for session termination.  This
   message flow is required for compatibility with DIAMETER protocol.
   Also the "State" attribute SHOULD be used as specified in RFC 3576
   [4].

5.  Accounting

   Application of the RADIUS protocol for QoS Authorization presented in
   this document use RADIUS Accounting as defined in the RFC2865,
   RFC2866 and RFC2869.  The definition of new accounting attributes may
   be necessary but left for further study.

   After a successful QoS authorization the RADIUS client starts the
   corresponding accounting session by sending the Accounting-Request
   message.  This message SHOULD contain necessary attributes to bind
   the current accounting session to the reported QoS session.  "Class"
   and "Acc-Session-ID" attributes SHOULD be used according to [1] and
   [2].The RADIUS server responds with a Accounting-Accept message after
   successfully processing the Accounting-Request message.  The
   Accounting-Accept message MAY contain instructions for managing the
   accounting session, such as the Accounting-Interim-Interval AVP.

   After every successful re-authorization procedure the RADIUS client
   SHOULD re-initiate accounting message exchange.

   After successful session termination the RADIUS client SHOULD
   initiate a final exchange of accounting messages with the RADIUS
   server.

6.  Attributes

   This section defines three categories of attributes:

   o  QSPEC parameters describing requested/authorized QoS

   o  Identification of the flow that should receive QoS described in
      QSPEC

   o  AVPs required to carry authorization information (e.g.,
      authorization tokens as specified in [7])


6.1  QSPEC Attribute

   The generic QoS description is taken from QoS-NSLP QSpec Template
   [14] which aims to support QoS parameters for all QoS reservations
   and is independent of a specific QoS model (QOSM).  The QSPEC
   template format is organized into QoS Control information, Requested,
   Reserved, Available and Minimun objects.  Each of the objects
   contains a number of QSPEC parameters.  For QoS authorization
   purposes only part of the parameters SHOULD be used, e.g., mainly
   those included into the QoS Desired and some of those included into
   QoS Control information objects.  In addition information for
   duration of the authorized QoS SHOULD be provided.

   QSPEC parameters and QoS authorization session management parameters
   are included as subtypes into the QSPEC attribute.  Subtypes not used
   are omitted in the message.

   Sub-Type (=15):  Sub-Type for Authorization lifetime attribute

   Length       :  Length of Authorization lifetime attribute (= 6
   octets)

   Authorization lifetime:

      The parameter indicates the duration of the authorized QoS
      provisioning.

   Sub-Type (=16):  Sub-Type for Authorized volume attribute

   Length       :  Length of Authorized volume attribute (= 6 octets)

   Authorized volume:

      The parameter indicates the data volume that should receive the
      authorized QoS.

   Sub-Type (=17):  Sub-Type for Application server ID attribute

   Length       :  Length of Authorized volume attribute (IPv4 = 6
   octets, IPv6= 18 octets)

   Application server ID:

      Application server ID indicates the address of the authorizing
      Application Server.

   Provided QSPEC parameters list is not exhaustive and SHOULD be
   updated according to [14].

6.2  Flow Identification

   Depending on the deployment and used QoS signaling protocol,
   identification of the flow that SHOULD received authorized QoS takes
   a different format.  Signaling session Identifier (NSIS) or flow
   identifier and explicit filter specifications are used.  The
   Attribute QoS-Flow-ID is designated to encapsulate such information.

   Sub-Type (=1):  Signaling Session ID

   Length       :  Length of Signaling Session ID attribute (= 6
   octets)

   Signaling Session ID:

      In NSIS framework [11], Signaling session ID is an unique
      identifier of the signaling session that remains unchanged for the
      duration of the session.  It is locally mapped to the specific
      flow identifiers.

   Additional Sub-Type attributes SHOULD be added, which combined with
   filter specifications (such as QoS-Filter-Rule [16]) provide flow
   identification.  [TBD]

6.3  Authorization Objects

   TBD:

7.  Diameter RADIUS Interoperability

   In deployments where RADIUS clients communicate with DIAMETER servers
   or DIAMETER clients communicate with RADIUS servers then a
   translation agent will be deployed and operate.  The DIAMETER-QoS
   specification [12] provides a natural candidate for mapping the
   RADIUS QoS related AVPs to DIAMETER AVPs and messages.

9.  Security Considerations

   For this extension to RADIUS protocol the security considerations
   defined in RFC2865 [1], RFC2866 [2], RFC2869 [3] and RFC3576 [4] are
   applicable.  Furthermore, the security of the QoS signaling protocol
   and the QoS authorization framework must be considered in the
   evaluation of the security properties.

   [Editor's Note: A more detailed treatment will be provided in a
   future document version.]
