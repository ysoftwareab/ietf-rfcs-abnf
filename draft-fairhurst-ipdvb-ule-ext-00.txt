1. Introduction 
    
   This document describes a set of Header Extensions for ULE [RFC4236] 
   over the MPEG-2 Transport-Stream. The methods are also applicable to 
   a link that uses the physical layer specified by DVB-S2 [ETSI-S2] in 
   the Generic Mode (also known as the Generic Stream (GS)). The 
   Generic Stream Encapsulation (GSE) [GSE] is currently a work item of 
   the DVB-TM. The requirements for the Generic Stream are defined in 
   [S2-REQ], [S2-REQ-RCS], and [ID-S2-REQ]. GSE maintains a design 
   philosophy that presents a similar network interface to that of ULE 
   and uses a similar construction for SNDUs. The important 
   characteristics of this encapsulation are described in an Appendix 
   to this document. 
    
   The approaches seek to define well-founded methods that may be used 
   with both ULE and GSE. This will present the same network layer 
   interface over both physical layers.  
 
   One method allows one or more TS-Packets [ISO-MPEG] to be sent 
   within a ULE SNDU. In GSE this method may be used to provide then 
   control plane information including the transmission of MPEG-2 
   Program Specific Information (PSI) for the Multiplex. 
    
   A second method allows one or more PDUs to be sent within the same 
   ULE SNDU. This method is designed for cases where a large number of 
   small PDUs are directed to the same Network Point of Attachment 
   (NPA) address. The method may improve transmission efficiency (by 
   removing duplicated MAC layer overhead).  It can also reduce 
   processing overhead for receivers that are not addressed by the NPA, 
   since these receivers may then skip several PDUs in one operation. 
   The method is defined as a generic extension header and may be used 
   for IPv4 or IPv6 packets. If and when a compression format is 
   defined for ULE or Ethernet, the method may also be used in 
   combination with this method. 
    
   Future versions of this document are expected to provide 
   recommendations on the interface between the Generic Stream 
   Encapsulation (GSE) and the Internet Protocol Stack. 
    
   The appendix is also expected to be enhanced to include a summary of 
   key design issues and considerations based on the GSE Specification 
   defined by the DVB-TM (e.g. [ID-S2-REQ]).

3. Description of the Method 
    
   In ULE, a Type field value less than 1536 Decimal indicates an 
   Extension Header.  This section describes a set of two extension 
   formats for the ULE encapsulation. 
    
    
3.1 MPEG-2 TS-Concat Extension  
    
   The MPEG-2 TS-Concat Extension Header is specified by an IANA 
   assigned H-Type value of <tbd>. This is a Mandatory Next-Header 
   Extension.   
    
   The extension is used to communicate 1 or more MPEG-2 TS Packets 
   within a ULE SNDU. The number of TS Packets carried in a specific 
   SNDU is determined from the size specified by the remainder of the 
   Payload following the MPEG-2 TS Extension. A Receiver MUST silently 
   discard any data, if present, between the last complete encapsulated 
   MPEG-2 TS Packet and the size denoted in the Length field of the 
   SNDU fragment base header.  
    
   A value of D=1 indicates there is no NPA/MAC address in use. A value 
   D=0 is also permitted, as defined in ULE. 
     
   The extension may be used to communicate one or more MPEG-2 TS 
   Packets of arbitrary content, interpreted according to [ISO-MPEG]. 
   One expected use is for the transmission of MPEG-2 SI/PSI signalling 
   and clock references over the ULE framing.

3.2 PDU-Concat Extension 
    
   The PDU-Concat Extension is specified by an IANA assigned H-Type 
   value of <tbd>. This is a Mandatory Next-Header Extension.  It 
   enables a sequence of (usually short) PDUs to be sent within a 
   single SNDU payload.  
    
   The base header contains the Length of the entire SNDU. This is set 
   to the combined length of all PDUs to be encapsulated, including 
   each set of encapsulation headers. 
    
   Each PDU is prefixed by its length in bytes (shown as PDU-Length in 
   the following diagrams) and a 16-bit ULE Type field. The most 
   significant bit of the first byte MUST must be set to zero. The 
   length of each PDU MUST be less than 32 768 bytes. The Type field 
   (shown as PDU-Type in the following figures) may be any ULE-
   specified Type. 
 
   The Receiver processes this Extension Header by extracting each PDU 
   in turn. The Receiver first verifies the Length of each PDU, and 
   ensures the sum of the Lengths of all processed PDUs is less than 
   the Length specified in the SNDU base header. A Receiver MUST 
   silently discard any data, if present, after the last complete 
   encapsulated PDU.

   A value of D=1 indicates there is no NPA/MAC address in use.  
    
   This field MUST be carried (i.e. D=0) for IP unicast packets 
   destined to routers that are sent using shared links (i.e., where 
   the same link connects multiple Receivers). A sender MAY omit this 
   field (D=1) for a set of packets delivered to a Receiver or group of 
   receivers that are able to utilise a discriminator field (e.g. the 
   IPv4/IPv6 destination address, or a bridged MAC destination 
   address), which in combination with the PID value, could be 
   interpreted as a Link-Level address. 
    
   When the SNDU header indicates the presence of an SNDU Destination 
   Address field (i.e. D=0), a Network Point of Attachment, NPA, field 
   directly follows the fourth byte of the SNDU header. NPA destination 
   addresses are 6 Byte numbers, normally expressed in hexadecimal, 
   used to identify the Receiver(s) in a transmission network that 
   should process a received SNDU.  When present the Receiver MUST 
   associate the same specified MAC/NPA address with all PDUs within 
   the SNDU Payload. This MAC/NPA address MUST also be forwarded with 
   each PDU, if required by the forwarding interface.

4. Summary 
    
   This document defines a set of Next_Header options for the 
   Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE).  
    
    
5. IANA Considerations  
    
   This document will require IANA involvement for the assignment of 
   two new Next-Header Type values from the IANA ULE Next-Header 
   Registry. These options are defined for specific use cases envisaged 
   by GSE, but are compatible with ULE.  
    
   The TS-Concat Extension is a Mandatory next-type extension header, 
   specified in section 3.1 of this document. The value of this next-
   header is defined by an IANA assigned H-Type value of <tbd>. 
    
   The PDU-Concat Extension is a Mandatory next-type extension header 
   specified in section 3.2 of this document. The value of this next-
   header is defined by an IANA assigned H-Type value of <tbd>.

7. Security Considerations 
    
   No specific security issues are raised within this document. 
    
   Additional security control fields may be provided as a part of a  
   link encryption Extension Header, e.g. to associate a PFU with one 
   of a set of Security Association (SA) parameters. As a part of the 
   encryption process, it may also be desirable to authenticate 
   some/all of the headers. The method of encryption and the way in 
   which keys are exchanged is beyond the scope of this specification, 
   as also are the definition of the SA format and that of the related  
   encryption keys.

APPENDIX: DVB-S.2 
    
   PDUs, (Ethernet Frames, IP datagrams or other network layer packets) 
   are encapsulated to form a Subnetwork Data Unit (SNDU) [RFC4236] 
   associated with a specific Stream at the link layer. The SNDU is 
   transmitted over an DVB-S2 link by placing it either in a single 
   BBFrame, or if required, an SNDU may be fragmented into a series of 
   BBFrames [ID-S2-REQ]. A mode also permits an SNDU to be fragmented 
   with the remaining fragments sent in a later BBFrame(s), while 
   preserving the original order of each SNDU sent to a specific 
   MAC/NPA address over a Stream. Where there is sufficient space, the 
   method permits a BBFrame to carry more than one SNDU (or part there 
   of), sometimes known as Packing. All parts comprising an SNDU are 
   assigned to the same Stream.  
 
   In ULE and MPE [ETSI-DAT], each SNDU carries a 32-bit CRC field in 
   the last four bytes of the SNDU. The purpose of this CRC is to 
   protect the SNDU (header, and payload) from undetected reassembly 
   errors and errors introduced by unexpected software / hardware 
   operation. This also serves to verify the delineation (framing) of 
   PDUs and may detect the presence of uncorrected errors from the 
   physical link 
    
   When an SNDU is sent over a DVB-S2 subnetwork using GSE, the 
   Integrity protection is provided by a CRC at the baseband frame 
   level.
