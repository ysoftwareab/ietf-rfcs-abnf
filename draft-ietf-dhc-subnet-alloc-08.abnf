Code  = Subnet Allocation option code (1 octet) 220

Len  = Length of the entire option including all sub-options (1
      octet)

Flags  = Various flags: (None currently defined)

Len  = Length of the suboption (always 2 for this suboption) (1
      octet)

Flags  = Flags field. (all unused bits must be zero)

      'h'

         '1'  = Client will be allocating addresses from this subnet.

         '0'  = Client will be relaying DHCP requests to the Server from
            this subnet.

      'i'

         '1'  = Client is seeking information about previously allocated
            subnets.

         '0'  = Client is seeking a new subnet allocation.










Prefix  = Size of the subnet needed [RFC1878] (number of bits in
      subnet prefix) (zero (0) means no suggested size is given) (1
      octet)

Len  = Length of the sub-option (min. length of 8) (1 octet)

Flags  = Various flags which apply to ALL Subnet Prefix Information
      fields specified in this suboption.  Unused flags must be zero.

      'c'  = Client flag (explained below)

      's'  = Server flag (explained below)

Addr  = IPv4 address (4 octets)

Prefix  = Specifying number of prefix bits in the subnet (1 octet)

Flags  = Flags field (Undefined bits must be zero) (1 octet)

      'd'  = Deprecate flag (explained below)

         '1'  = Deprecation of this subnet is requested.

         '0'  = No deprecation is needed.

      'h'  = Hierarchical (explained below)

         '1'  = Client will be allocating addresses from this subnet.

         '0'  = Client will be relaying DHCP requests to the Server from
            this subnet.

Stat-len  = Length of the optional statistics information field (zero
      if no statistics are included)

Len  = length of the sub-option (min. length of 1) (1 octet)

Len  = length of the sub-option (always 4 for this suboption) (1
      octet)
