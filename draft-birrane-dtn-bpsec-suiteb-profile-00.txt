          Suite B Profile for Bundle Protocol Security (BPSec)
               draft-birrane-dtn-bpsec-suiteb-profile-00

Abstract

   The United States Government has published guidelines for "NSA Suite
   B Cryptography" dated July, 2005, which defines cryptographic
   algorithm policy for national security applications.  This document
   specifies the conventions for using Suite B cryptography with Bundle
   Protocol Security (BPSec).

   Since many of the Suite B algorithms enjoy uses in other environments
   as well, the majority of the conventions needed for the Suite B
   algorithms are already specified in other documents.  This document
   references the source of these conventions, with some relevant
   details repeated to aid developers that choose to support Suite B
   within BPSec.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the conventions for using NSA Suite B
   Cryptography [SuiteB] with Bundle Protocol Security (BPSec)
   [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec].  This document is an update to the Suite-B
   profile created by Burgin and Hennessy
   [I-D.hennessy-bsp-suiteb-profile].  This update adapts the profile
   from BSP [RFC6257] to BPSec.

   BPSec provides source authentication, data integrity, and data
   confidentiality services for the Bundle Protocol (BP) [RFC5050].

   [I-D.birrane-dtn-bpsec-suiteb-ciphersuites] defines ciphersuites for
   BPSec that are comprised of Suite B algorithms for use with the
   security block types BAB, BIB, and BCB.  Suite B compliant
   implementations for BPSec MUST use one of these ciphersuites,
   depending upon the desired security level and security services.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  Suite B Requirements

   Suite B requires that key establishment and signature algorithms be
   based upon Elliptic Curve Cryptography and that the encryption
   algorithm be AES [FIPS197].  Suite B includes [SuiteB]:

   Encryption:
           Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [FIPS197] (key sizes of
           128 and 256 bits)

   Digital Signature:
           Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
           [FIPS186-3] (using the curves with 256- and 384-bit prime
           moduli).

   Key Exchange:
           Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) [SP800-56A] (using the
           curves with 256- and 384-bit prime moduli).

   Hashes:
           SHA-256 and SHA-384 [FIPS180-3].

   The two elliptic curves used in Suite B appear in the literature
   under two different names.  For sake of clarity, we list both names
   below.

          +-------+-----------+-----------+---------------------+
          | Curve | NIST Name | SECG Name |   OID [FIPS186-3]   |
          +-------+-----------+-----------+---------------------+
          | P-256 |  nistp256 | secp256r1 | 1.2.840.10045.3.1.7 |
          | P-384 |  nistp384 | secp384r1 |     1.3.132.0.34    |
          +-------+-----------+-----------+---------------------+

4.  Minimum Levels of Security (minLOS)

   Suite B provides for two levels of cryptographic security, namely a
   128-bit minimum level of security (minLOS_128) and a 192-bit minimum
   level of security (minLOS_192).  Each level defines a minimum
   strength that all cryptographic algorithms must provide.

4.1.  Non-signature Primitives

   We divide the Suite B non-signature primitives into two columns as
   shown in Table 1.

       |                  | Column 1          | Column 2          |
       +------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
       | Encryption       | AES-128           | AES-256           |
       | Key Agreement    | ECDH on P-256     | ECDH on P-384     |
       | Key Wrap         | AES-128 Key Wrap  | AES-256 Key Wrap  |
       | Hash for PRF/MAC | SHA-256           | SHA-384           |
       +------------------+-------------------+-------------------+

          Table 1: Suite B Cryptographic Non-Signature Primitives

   At the 128-bit minimum level of security:

      the non-signature primitives MUST either come exclusively from
      Column 1 or exclusively from Column 2, with Column 1 being the
      preferred suite.

   At the 192-bit minimum level of security:

      the non-signature primitives MUST come exclusively from Column 2.

4.2.  Suite B Authentication

   Digital signatures using ECDSA MUST be used for authentication by
   Suite B compliant BPSec implementations.  To simplify notation,
   ECDSA- 256 will be used to represent an instantiation of the ECDSA
   algorithm using the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash function, and
   ECDSA-384 will be used to represent an instantiation of the ECDSA
   algorithm using the P-384 curve and the SHA-384 hash function.

   If configured at a minimum level of security of 128 bits, a Suite B
   compliant BPSec implementation MUST use either ECDSA-256 or ECDSA-384
   for authentication.  It is allowable for one party to authenticate
   with ECDSA-256 and the other party to authenticate with ECDSA-384.

   Security-aware nodes in a Suite B compliant BPSec implementation
   configured at a minimum level of security of 128 bits MUST be able to
   verify ECDSA-256 signatures and SHOULD be able to verify ECDSA-384
   signatures unless it is absolutely certain that the implementation
   will never need to verify certificates from an authority which uses
   an ECDSA-384 signing key.

   Security-aware nodes in a Suite B compliant BPSec implementation
   configured at a minimum level of security of 192 bits MUST use ECDSA-
   384 for authentication and MUST be able to verify ECDSA-384
   signatures.

4.3.  Digital Signatures and Certificates

   Security-aware nodes in a Suite B compliant BPSec implementation, at
   both minimum levels of security, MUST each use an X.509 certificate
   that complies with the "Suite B Certificate and Certificate
   Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [RFC5759] and that contains an
   elliptic curve public key with the key usage field set for digital
   signature.  The endpoint IDs MUST be placed in the subjectAltName
   field of the X.509 certificate.

5.  Suite B Ciphersuites

   Each system MUST specify a security level of a minimum of 128 bits or
   192 bits.  The security level determines which suites from
   [I-D.birrane-dtn-bpsec-suiteb-ciphersuites] are allowed.

   Each of the ciphersuites specified in
   [I-D.birrane-dtn-bpsec-suiteb-ciphersuites] satisfy the Suite B
   requirements in Section 3 of this document.

   At the 128-bit minimum level of security:

      If a Block Integrity Block (BIB) is included in the bundle, one of
      BIB-ECDSA-SHA256 or BIB-ECDSA-SHA384 MUST be used by Suite B
      compliant BPSec implementations.

      If a Block Confidentiality Block (BCB) is included in the bundle,
      one of BCB-ECDH-SHA256-AES128 or BCB-ECDH-SHA384-AES256 MUST be
      used by Suite B compliant BPSec implementations.

   At the 192-bit minimum level of security:

      If a Block Integrity Block (BIB) is included in the bundle, BIB-
      ECDSA-SHA384 MUST be used by Suite B compliant BPSec
      implementations.

      If a Block Confidentiality Block (BCB) is included in the bundle,
      BCB-ECDH-SHA384-AES256 MUST be used by Suite B compliant BPSec
      implementations.

6.  Security Considerations

   Two levels of security may be achieved using this specification.
   Users must consider their risk environment to determine which level
   is appropriate for their own use.

   This specification does not consider the CMS Block of the BPSec
   specification.  Details for using CMS in Suite B can be found in

Internet-DraftSuite B Profile for Bundle Protocol Security December 2015


   [RFC6318].  The security considerations in [RFC5652] discuss the CMS
   as a method for digitally signing data and encrypting data.

7.  IANA Considerations

   None.
