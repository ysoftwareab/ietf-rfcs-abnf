                    Constrained Signaling Over LPWA
                     draft-minaburo-6lpwa-cosol-00

Abstract

   This document presents a new type of long-range, low-rate radio
   technologies and an extensible mechanism to operate these networks
   based on CoAP.  The emerging Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWA)
   present a particular set of constraints, which places them at the
   intersection of infrastructure networks, ultra-dense networks, delay-
   tolerant networks and low-power and lossy networks.  The main
   objectives of LPWA signaling is to minimize the number of exchanged
   messages, minimize the size of each message in a secure and
   extensible manner, all with keeping the fundamental principle of
   technology-independence (L2-independence).  This document describes
   the use of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) as the main
   signaling protocol for LPWA, over which minimal messages are
   exchanged allowing the full operation of the network, such as
   authentication, authorization, and management.  The use of CoAP
   signaling provides a generic mechanism that can be applied to
   different LPWA technologies.

1.  Introduction

   The goal of this document is to provide the necessary mechanisms to
   operate a Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWA) by using IETF CoAP
   [RFC7252] as a core signaling protocol.

   Long-range, low-rate radio technologies have emerged in the past
   several years, and are the base for building LPWAs.  LPWAs generally
   have the following characteristics:

   o  Work in narrow, license-free (ISM) bands with good propagation
      properties (< 1GHz)

   o  Low- to very-low throughput (1-200 kbps)

   o  Low-power operation (25 mW in Europe)

   o  Long-range communication capabilities (up to 30 km with line-of-
      sight, several km in urban environment)

   o  Strong channel access restrictions (1% to 10% duty cycling)

   o  Infrastructure-based

   o  Star topology

   LPWAs are built on radio communication technologies, which use
   advanced signal processing techniques and combination of appropriate
   modulation and coding approaches to provide the aforementioned radio
   characteristics.

   The absence of license fees and the far-reaching connectivity allow
   for an extremely competitive pricing of LPWAs compared to other
   networking technologies, e.g. cellular or mesh.  LPWAs are sometimes
   referred to as LP-WAN or LR-WAN (Low-Rate WAN).  Even though LPWAs
   are extremely limited in terms of network performance, they are
   enough for a wide class of applications, among which [LTN001]:

   o  Metering (water, gas, electricity)

   o  Infrastructure networks (water, gas, electricity, roads,
      pipelines, drains)

   o  Environment/Smart City (waste management, air pollution monitoring
      and alerting, acoustic noise monitoring, public lighting
      management, parking management, self service bike rental, digital
      board monitoring, water pipe leakage monitoring)

   o  Environment/Country side (soil quality, livestock surveillance,
      cattle and pet monitoring, climate, irrigation)

   o  Remote monitoring (house, building)

   o  Industrial (water tank, asset tracking)

   o  Automotive (vehicle tracking, impact detection, pay as you drive,
      assistance request, ...)

   o  Logistics (goods tracking, conservation monitoring)

   o  Healthcare (patient monitoring, home medical equipment usage)

   o  House appliances (pet tracking, white goods, personal asset)

   o  Truck (tyre monitoring)

   o  Identification (authentication)

   The IEEE is studying LPWAs, but limited to the case of low-energy
   critical infrastructure monitoring (LECIM), under the group IEEE
   802.15.4k [IEEE.802-15.4k].

   The combination of the above characteristics and the envisioned
   applications define a new class of networks with the following unique
   constraints:

   o  Potentially extremely high density (expected of up to 10k-100k+
      end-devices managed by a single radio antena)

   o  Coexistence of delay-tolerant and critical applications (metering
      and alarms)

   o  Low-power, low-throughput, lossy connectivity (use of ISM bands)

   o  Limited payload (100 bytes max, typically less than 50 bytes, 12
      bytes for UNB)

   CoAP is a client-server protocol specialized for constrained networks
   and devices.  CoAP is highly optimized, extensible, standard
   protocol, which in conjunction with the Concise Binary Object
   Representation (CBOR) is the ideal candidate for the signaling
   protocol of the control plane of an LPWA.

   It can be used during all stages of the lifecycle of the network,
   e.g. discovery, authentication, operation.  Furthermore, this can be
   achieved by following RESTful management paradigm, by using a

   particular resource tree definition or adopting COOL
   [I-D.veillette-core-cool].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  LPWA Technologies

2.1.  Radio technologies

   There are two classes of LPWA radio technologies, using different
   radio modulation approaches:

   o  Ultra Narrow Band (UNB)

   o  Spread-spectrum (SS)

   An example of UNB is the technology developed and promoted by SigFox
   [SigFox].  Semtech LoRa [LoRa] uses a direct-sequence spread-spectrum
   with orthogonal codes (OSSS).

   Both approaches have their advantages and will coexist in the future,
   as there are currently several operators, which deploy the two types
   in the same areas.

2.2.  Physical Layer Characteristics

   At the physical layer, the important part is the possibility to
   reconstruct the signal at long distances.  The used ISM bands are
   defined around the world (e.g. 868 MHz in Europe and 900 MHz in USA)
   and require a 1% (or 10%) duty cycling, or alternatively - advanced
   detection and channel reallocation techniques.  In reality, all
   deployed networks use the duty cycling limitation, with the following
   distinction.  There is one 100kHz band in which 10% duty cycling is
   allowed, with a slightly more emission power.  The rest of the bands
   are limited at 1% duty cycling and very restricted power of emission
   (e.g. 25 mW in Europe).

   UNB LPWAs make the distinction between Uplink and Downlink, first
   depending on the modulation, and second with the 10% duty-cycling
   channel been used for the Downlink.  OSSS LPWAs make no such
   distinction, although for the operation of a network, an operator can
   chose to use the same Uplink/Downlink channel separation.

   Note that the 1% or 10% duty-cycle limitation counts for all trafic
   originating from an electronic equipment, e.g. an antena managing
   100k objects must obey the same limitation as an end-device, with all
   frames emitted from the antena (data, acknowledgements) counting
   towards its quota.

2.2.1.  Ultra Narrowband LPWA radios

   Ultra Narrowband (UNB) technologies generally possess the following
   physical layer characteristics [LTN003]:

   o  Uplink:

      *  channelization mask 100kHz (600 kHz USA)

      *  baud rate 100 bauds (600 bauds USA)

      *  modulation BPSK

   o  Downlink:

      *  channelization mask: dynamic selection

      *  down link baud rate: 600 baud

      *  modulation scheme: GFSK

      *  downlink transmission power: 500 mW, 10% duty cycle

2.2.2.  Spread-spectrum LPWA radios

   OSSS technologies possess the following physical layer
   characteristics [LTN003]:

   o  channelization mask: from 8 kHz to 500 kHz (depending on spreading
      factor)

   o  chip rate: 8 kcps up to 500 kcps

   o  data rate: 30-50 000 bps

   o  modulation scheme: equivalent to DSSS with orthogonal signaling

   No particular distinction is made between the Uplink and the
   Downlink.

2.3.  MAC Layer Characteristics

   Several proprietary MAC frame formats exist for UNB and OSSS.
   However, they are designed to operate the network in a centralized,
   highly-vertically-integrated fashion.  The only standard MAC frame
   format is the IEEE 802.15.4k, which is based on the well-known IEEE
   802.15.4 with the addition of a fragmentation sub-layer.

   The channel access method is based on ALOHA, although it is up to the
   network operator to chose if an appropriate end-node polling should
   be implemented.

3.  CoSOL Architecture

3.1.  General LPWA architecture

   We can identify three types of entities in a typical LPWA.  These
   are:

   o  Node-F: far-reachable node, e.g. the end-point, object, device.

   o  Node-R: radio relay, bridging the LPWA radio technology to a
      different medium (often a LAN or cellular WAN).

   o  Node-G: gateway node, interconnection between the radio-relay node
      and the Internet.

   +--------+                    +--------+            +--------+
   | Node-F | <-- LPWA radio --> | Node-R | <-- IP --> | Node-G |
   +--------+                    +--------+            +--------+

   General architecture of an LPWA.  LPWA radio technology is used only
                    between the Node-F and the Node-R.

                                 Figure 1

   Of these, only Node-F and Node-R communicate through an LPWA radio
   technology.  However, due to the extreme constraints of these
   technologies, they are always behind a gateway (Node-G).  Note, that
   the Node-R and Node-G can be collocated, e.g. on a single hardware
   equipment.

   The Node-G is connected to the Internet and is assumed to have
   sufficient computational resources to store a context for each of the
   Node-Fs.  The strong limitation here is the radio link.

   In an actual deployment, a (limited) set of Node-Rs cover a large
   area with a potentially very-high number of Node-Fs.  A single Node-G
   is capable of controlling all Node-Rs.

             single Node-F may be covered by several Node-Rs.

3.2.  Node-F lifecycle

   Similar to other wireless infrastructure-based technologies, a Node-F
   can go through several stages:

   o  Semi-Association

   o  Network Discovery

   o  Association

   o  Authentication

   o  Dissociation

   The Node-F state machine is then the following:

                                 Figure 3

   The Node-F can be in Semi-Associated mode.  Upon start, and depending
   on the application, a Node-F can use a state of uni-directional
   communication, where it is considered semi-associated to the network.
   In that state, the Node-F broadcasts frames, handled by the Node-G,
   but the network cannot join the Node-F on a regular basis.  This is a
   degraded LPWA operating mode and if caution is not used, can lead to
   significant scalability and evolvability issues.

   The Network Discovery can be reactive or proactive.  The former is
   based on detecting beacon frames sent periodically by the network
   (e.g.  Node-G).  The latter is implemented by the Node-F broadcasting
   probe request frames, to which all appropriate Node-Gs must respond.

   Once a network has been discovered, the Node-F can associate to the
   network.  The association creates the necessary (minimal) context on
   the Node-G, which initiates the authentication of the Node-F

   The authentication is initiated by the Node-G, which should allow for
   the necessary AAA exchanges to take place.  If the authentication is
   successful, the Node-F enters the Authenticated state.  In this stage
   there is bi-directional communication between the Node-F and the
   Node-G.  If the authentication is not successful, the Node-F enters
   Disconnected state.  Once in Authenticated state, the Node-F can
   downgrade its connectivity to Semi-Associated mode.

   The management of the node in Authenticated state is performed with
   COOL [I-D.veillette-core-cool].  As an example, managing the
   parameters of a Semtech LoRa device can be achieved through the use
   of the YANG module defined in

   Finally, the Node-F may decide to dissociate from the network by
   sending an explicit request.  Upon dissociation the Node-G may
   release all contexts related to the Node-F and re-association

   requires going through the authentication stage again.  Node mobility
   is achieved by explicitly dissociating from the old Node-G and then
   authenticating to the new Node-G.  Implicit dissociation is also
   possible upon the expiration of predefined timers, or in case of
   mobility optimization.

3.3.  CoAP as Signaling Protocol for LPWAs

   Use as CoAP for signaling is implemented as follows.  The MAC,
   network and/or transport layers MUST provide a mechanism to
   differentiate user data from signaling data frames (e.g. by using
   separate MAC addresses, IP addresses and/or UDP-ports).  Both the
   Node-G and the Node-F are running CoAP servers for implementing the
   control plane.  Frames exchanged over the LPWA radio interface and
   marked as "signaling data" are handled by the corresponding control
   plane CoAP servers.

   The Node-G runs a (virtual) CoAP server for each Node-F.  This server
   is identified with a DNS name, e.g. "node123.home.node-
   g.example.com", which can be used explicitly in the CoAP messages via
   the Proxy-Uri option if needed.

   Note, that the Node-R acts only as a transceiver and as such is
   transparent from protocol point of view.  As such, the following
   management scheme applies:

   +--------+                          +--------+
   | Node-F | <-- LPWA constraints --> | Node-G |
   +--------+                          +--------+

             Node-F connectivity from protocol point of view.

                                 Figure 4

3.3.1.  Semi-Association

   When in a semi-associated state, a Node-F broadcasts its messages
   without performing network discovery, or association.  If the Node-F
   is under the coverage of a Node-G, the Node-G will receive the
   broadcast, and forward the user data.  The frames SHOULD be signed,
   so that they could be authenticated by the network.  Layer 2
   acknowledgements MUST be used, and in some cases piggybacking on them
   can provoke the Node-F to associate to the network.

   The broadcast messages MUST include the necessary information to join
   the user data destination, and enough information for the Node-G to
   authenticate the message sender.  This can be achieved through a
   Confirmable CoAP message, where the user data are POSTed to a well-

   known resource defined on the Node-G.  DTLS with integrity check can
   be used, with long-lived keys negotiated by the Node-F and the
   network.  Alternatively, COSE objects may provide the necessary
   mechanisms.

   Even though an application can be implemented by using only simplex
   association capabilities, there are non-negligible negative
   consequences related to scalability and evolvability in this case.
   For example, a Node-F which periodically broadcasts information will
   occupy the spectrum, even if there is no operator willing to accept
   its trafic.  In addition, no channel access management can be
   applied.

3.3.2.  Network Discovery

   A network can be discovered by a Node-F reactively or proactively.

   Reactive network discovery is based on the detection of periodic
   beacons emitted by the Node-G.  The beacons are implemented with CoAP
   messages with the No-Response option
   [I-D.tcs-coap-no-response-option].  The Node-G POSTs its information
   to a well-known resource, e.g. "/network/node-G/" or a resource alias
   "/g".  Alternatively, this could be achieved by POST-ting to a COOL
   container (e.g.  POST /cool with data node ID = 1 for example).

     Reactive network discovery.  The Node-G sends periodically beacon
        messages, containing information pertinent to this network.

                                 Figure 6

   The CoAP POST request is processed at the Node-F.  A resource is
   created locally, with the representation, which provides the
   appropriate network parameters, e.g. network ID, Node-G ID, and other
   radio-related parameters, such as channel, beacon frequency and so
   forth.  This information allows the Node-F to begin the
   authentication phase.

   A Node-F may chose to proactively probe for the existence of network
   coverage.  In that case, it sends a Confirmable CoAP GET request to
   obtain the information from a well-known resource, normally published
   by the beacon messages, e.g. "/network/node-G/" or a resource alias
   "/g" or COOL data node ID ("/cool" data node ID = 2 for example).

                                 Figure 7

   Once the network is discovered, the Node-F has all necessary
   information to start the authentication phase.

3.3.3.  Association

   Before being able to communicate, the Node-F must associate to the
   network, and then eventually authenticate.  The association phase
   signals to the Node-G that there is a new device willing to
   communicate with the network.  This association SHOULD provide enough
   information to allow the Node-G to start the authentication process.
   For example, it may provide the AAA server, which could authenticate
   the Node-F, or its EAP-Identity.  Note, that the Node-F may elect to
   mark the association message with the No-response option
   [I-D.tcs-coap-no-response-option], waiting for the subsequent
   authentication request from the Node-G.

   Node-F     Node-G
     |          |
     |          |
     +--------->|           Header: POST
     | POST /n  |         Uri-Path: "n"
     |          |          Payload: ...
     |          |
     |<---------+           Header: 2.01 Created
     |   2.01   |    Location-Path: "/n/n705"
     |          |

   Node-F associates to a network, by creating a corresponding resource
                          element on the Node-G.

                                 Figure 8

3.3.4.  Authentication

   The EAP-over-CoAP [I-D.marin-ace-wg-coap-eap]  specifies an approach
   to encapsulating EAP messages over CoAP.  This allows to authenticate
   a Node-F, which wishes to join an LPWA, and negotiate the L2
   encryption keys, and DTLS keying material.

   As the Node-F has already associated to the Node-G, it is the Node-G
   that initiates the authentification request, by going directly to
   Step 1) of the EAP-over-CoAP specification.

    Node-F and Node-G perform mutual authentication following EAP-over-
                                   CoAP.

                                 Figure 9

   Upon the end of the authentication phase, a Master Shared Key (MSK)
   is known by the Node-F and the Node-G, and is used to generate DTLS
   encryption or integrity keys.  Further communications should be
   encrypted/signed with the freshly derived keys.

3.3.5.  Operation

   Once the Node-F is authenticated to the network, it can send user
   data via the Node-G to any other end-point on the Internet.

   During the operation of the Node-F, the network may need to change
   one or more parameters concerning the LPWA radio parameters of the
   Node-F.  These changes may even concern parameters related to the
   Node-F itself (such as sleep cycles), its network parameters (e.g.
   IP addresses), and so forth.  This is achieved through the use of
   COOL [I-D.veillette-core-cool].  The appropriate YANG modules must be
   present on the Node-F (e.g. a Semtech LoRa Node-F should implement
   the .

   Example, in which the Node-G changes the Spreading Factor (e.g.  COOL
    data node ID = 5) to 10, and the Channel (e.g.  COOL data node ID =
           6) to 2.  Note, that the payload is encoded in CBOR.

                                 Figure 10

3.3.6.  Dissociation

   If the Node-F wishes to deregister from the network, it could do so
   by deleting the context created upon association:

   Node-F           Node-G
     |                |
     |                |
     +--------------->|           Header: POST
     | DELETE /n/n705 |         Uri-Path: "n/n705"
     |                |
     |                |
     |<---------------+           Header: 2.02 Deleted
     |      2.02      |
     |                |

      Node-F dissociates from the network by deleting its associated
                                resources.
