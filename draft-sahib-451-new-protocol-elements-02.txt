1.  Introduction

   [RFC7725] was standardized by the IETF in February 2016.  It defined
   HTTP status code 451 - to be used when "a server operator has
   received a legal demand to deny access to a resource or to a set of
   resources".

   This document attempts to outline protocol recommendations that would
   help make the status code more useful to users.

2.  New Protocol Elements

2.1.  Blocking Authority

   In addition to the "blocked-by" header specified in [RFC7725], an
   HTTP response with status code 451 would benefit from including
   another "Link" HTTP header field [RFC5988] which has a "rel"
   parameter whose value is "blocking-authority".  It's important to
   distinguish between the implementer of the block, and the authority
   that mandated the block in the first place.  This is because these
   two organizations might not be the same - a government (the blocking
   authority) could force an Internet Service Provider (the implementer
   of the block) to deny access to a certain resource.  There is
   confusion amongst implementors of [RFC7725] about the meaning of the
   term "blocked-by", perhaps in part because of the example given in
   the RFC [ERRATA_ID-5181] - it would be useful to explicitly include
   space for both, as both provide essential information about the legal
   block.

2.2.  Geographical Scope of Block

   HTTP status code 451 is increasingly being used to deny access to
   resources based on geographical IP.  The response should contain a
   provisional header with geographical scope of block.  This scope
   should correspond to comma-separated list of alpha-2 country codes
   defined in [ISO.3166-1].  The rationale for keeping the geographical
   scope to country-level granularity is that most blocks are mandated
   by national governments [IMPL_REPORT],
   [AUTOMATTIC_COUNTRY_BLOCK_LIST].  In addition, as the serving of this
   status code is voluntary, there is value in not complicating the
   specification.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not add additional security considerations to
   [RFC7725].

4.  IANA Considerations

   The Link Relation Type Registry should be updated with the following
   entry:

   -  Relation Name: blocking-authority

   -  Description: Identifies the authority that has issued the block.

   -  Reference: this document

   In addition, IANA should be updated with the following provisional
   header:

   -  Header field name: geo-scope-block

   -  Applicable protocol: http

   -  Status: provisional

   -  Specification document(s): this document
