<b>Notes:</b><br/>
This spec does obsolete RFC 2731. The ID http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-reschke-rfc2731bis-05 says that, and it was approved that way (see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-reschke-rfc2731bis/#writeup).<br/><br/>(Note that my records show that the AUTH48 version of the XML version of this document is correct, so the error was introduced later on).

     RFC 2731 (&quot;Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in HTML&quot;) Is Obsolete

Abstract

   This document obsoletes RFC 2731, &quot;Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in
   HTML&quot;, as further development of this specification has moved to the
   Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI).

1.  Introduction

   [RFC2731] defines &quot;Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in HTML&quot;.  Newer
   specifications published by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative
   (http://dublincore.org/) over the last decade, in particular
   &quot;Expressing Dublin Core metadata using HTML/XHTML meta and link
   elements&quot; ([DC-HTML]), have obsoleted this work.

      Note: Implementers of RFC 2731 should note that DC-HTML introduces
      a new requirement with respect to the use of the &quot;head&quot; element&#x27;s
      &quot;profile&quot; attribute.

2.  Security Considerations

   This document is of administrative nature only and therefore there
   are no security relations related to it.
