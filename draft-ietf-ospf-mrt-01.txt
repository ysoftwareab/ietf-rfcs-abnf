          OSPF Extensions to Support Maximally Redundant Trees
                         draft-ietf-ospf-mrt-01

Abstract

   This document specifies extensions to OSPF to support the distributed
   computation of Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT).  Some example uses of
   the MRTs include IP/LDP Fast-Reroute and global protection or live-
   live for multicast traffic.  The extensions indicate what MRT
   profile(s) each router supports.  Different MRT profiles can be
   defined to support different uses and to allow transitioning of
   capabilities.  An extension is introduced to flood MRT-Ineligible
   links, due to administrative policy.

   The need for a mechanism to allow routers to advertise a worst-case
   FIB compute/install time is well understood for controlling
   convergence.  This specification introduces the Controlled
   Convergence TLV to be carried in the Router Information LSA.

Internet-Draft       OSPF Extensions to Support MRT         October 2015


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the OSPF extensions necessary to support the
   architecture that defines how IP/LDP Fast-Reroute can use MRTs
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture].  At least one common
   standardized algorithm (such as the lowpoint algorithm explained and
   fully documented in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm]) is required
   so that the routers supporting MRT computation consistently compute
   the same MRTs.  MRT can also be used to protect multicast traffic via
   either global protection or local
   protection.[I-D.atlas-rtgwg-mrt-mc-arch]

   IP/LDP Fast-Reroute using MRTs can provide 100% coverage for link and
   node failures in an arbitrary network topology where the failure
   doesn't split the network.  It can also be deployed incrementally
   inside an OSPF area; an MRT Island is formed of connected supporting
   routers and the MRTs are computed inside that island.

   In the default MRT profile, a supporting router both computes the
   MRTs and creates the necessary transit forwarding state necessary to
   provide the two additional forwarding topologies, known as MRT-Blue
   and MRT-Red.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]

3.  Terminology

   For ease of reading, some of the terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture] is repeated here.

   network graph:   A graph that reflects the network topology where all
      links connect exactly two nodes and broadcast links have been
      transformed into the standard pseudo-node representation.

   Redundant Trees (RT):   A pair of trees where the path from any node
      X to the root R along the first tree is node-disjoint with the
      path from the same node X to the root along the second tree.
      These can be computed in 2-connected graphs.

   Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT):   A pair of trees where the path
      from any node X to the root R along the first tree and the path
      from the same node X to the root along the second tree share the
      minimum number of nodes and the minimum number of links.  Each

      such shared node is a cut-vertex.  Any shared links are cut-links.
      Any RT is an MRT but many MRTs are not RTs.

   MRT Island:   From the computing router, the set of routers that
      support a particular MRT profile and are connected via MRT-
      eligible links.

   GADAG:   Generalized Almost Directed Acyclic Graph - a graph that is
      the combination of the ADAGs of all blocks.  Transforming a
      network graph into a GADAG is part of the MRT algorithm.

   MRT-Red:   MRT-Red is used to describe one of the two MRTs; it is
      used to described the associated forwarding topology and MT-ID.
      Specifically, MRT-Red is the decreasing MRT where links in the
      GADAG are taken in the direction from a higher topologically
      ordered node to a lower one.

   MRT-Blue:   MRT-Blue is used to describe one of the two MRTs; it is
      used to described the associated forwarding topology and MT-ID.
      Specifically, MRT-Blue is the increasing MRT where links in the
      GADAG are taken in the direction from a lower topologically
      ordered node to a higher one.

4.  Overview of OSPF Extensions for MRT

   There are two separate aspects that need to be advertised in OSPF.
   Both derive from the need for all routers supporting an MRT profile
   to compute the same pair of MRTs to each destination.  By executing
   the same algorithm on the same network graph, distributed routers
   will compute the same MRTs.  Convergence considerations are discussed
   in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture].

   The first aspect that must be advertised is which MRT profile(s) are
   supported and the associated GADAG Root Selection Priority.  The
   second aspect that must be advertised is any links that are not
   eligible, due to administrative policy, to be part of the MRTs.  This
   must be advertised consistently across the area so that all routers
   in the MRT Island use the same network graph.

4.1.  Supporting MRT Profiles

   An MRT Profile defines the exact MRT Algorithm, the MRT-Red LDP MT-
   ID, the MRT-Blue LDP MT-ID, and the forwarding mechanisms supported
   for the transit MRT-Red and MRT-Blue forwarding topologies.  Finally,
   the MRT Profile defines exact behavioral rules such as:

   o  how reconvergence is handled,




Atlas, et al.            Expires April 20, 2016                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       OSPF Extensions to Support MRT         October 2015


   o  inter-area forwarding behavior,

   A router that advertises support for an MRT Profile MUST provide the
   specified forwarding mechanism for its MRT-Red and MRT-Blue
   forwarding topologies.  A router that advertises support for an MRT
   Profile MUST implement an algorithm that produces the same set of
   MRT-Red and MRT-Blue next-hops for its MRT-Red and MRT-Blue
   topologies as is provided by the algorithm specified in the MRT
   Profile.

   A router MAY indicate support for multiple MRT Profiles.  A router
   computes its local MRT Island for each separate MRT Profile that the
   router supports.  Supporting multiple MRT Profiles also provides a
   mechanism for transitioning from one profile to another.  Different
   uses of MRT forwarding topologies may behave better on different MRT
   profiles.

   The default MRT Profile is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture].  Its behavior is intended to
   support IP/LDP unicast and multicast fast-reroute.

4.2.  GADAG Root Selection

   One aspect of the MRT algorithms is that the selection of the GADAG
   root can affect the alternates and the traffic through that GADAG
   root.  Therefore, it is important to provide an operator with control
   over which router will play the role of GADAG root.  A measure of the
   centrality of a node may help determine how good a choice a
   particular node is.

   The GADAG Root Selection Policy (defined as part of an MRT profile)
   may make use of the GADAG Root Selection Priority value advertised in
   the MRT Profile TLV of the Router Information LSA.  For example, the
   GADAG Root Selection Policy for the default MRT profile is the
   following: Among the routers in the MRT Island and with the highest
   priority advertised, an implementation MUST pick the router with the
   highest Router ID to be the GADAG root.

4.3.  Triggering an MRT Computation

   When an MRT Computation is triggered, it is triggered for a given MRT
   Profile in a given area.  First, the associated MRT Island is
   determined.  Then, the GADAG Root is selected.  Finally, the actual
   MRT algorithm is run to compute the transit MRT-Red and MRT-Blue
   topologies.  Additionally, the router MAY choose to compute MRT-FRR
   alternates or make other use of the MRT computation results.

   Prefixes can be attached and detached and have their associated MRT-
   Red and MRT-Blue next-hops computed without requiring a new MRT
   computation.

5.  MRT Capability Advertisement

   A router that supports MRT indicates this by setting a newly defined
   M bit in the Router LSA.  If the router provides no other information
   via a separate MRT Profile TLV, then the router supports the default
   MRT Profile with a GADAG Root Selection Priority of 128.

   In addition, a router can advertise a newly-defined MRT Profile TLV
   within the scope of the OSPF router information LSA [RFC4970].  This
   TLV also includes the GADAG Root Selection Priority.

5.1.  Advertising MRT Capability in OSPFv2

   A new M-bit is defined in the Router-LSA (defined in [RFC2328] and
   updated in [RFC4915]), as pictured below.

                        M-bit in OSPFv2 Router LSA

   M bit:   When set, the router supports MRT.  If no separate MRT
      Profile TLV is advertised in the associated Router Information
      LSA, then the router supports the default MRT Profile for the
      default MT topology and has a GADAG Root Selection Priority of
      128.

5.2.  Advertising MRT Capability in OSPFv3

   Similarly, the M-bit is defined in the OSPFv3 Router LSA [RFC5340] as
   shown below.  Since there can be multiple router LSAs in OSPFv3, the
   M-bit SHOULD be set in all of them.  However, in the case of a
   mismatch, the values in the LSA with the lowest Link State ID take
   precedence.

5.3.  MRT Profile TLV in Router Information LSA

   A router may advertise an MRT Profile TLV to indicate support for
   multiple MRT Profiles, for a non-default MRT Profile, and/or to
   indicate a non-default GADAG Root Selection Priority.  The MRT

   Profile TLV is advertised within the OSPF router information LSA
   which is defined for both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 in [RFC4970].  The RI LSA
   MUST have area scope.

   Note that the presence of the MRT Profile TLV indicates support for a
   given MRT profile in the default topology (MT-ID = 0).  The
   extensions in this document do not define a method to advertise
   support for MRT profiles in topologies with non-zero MT-ID.

                 MRT Profile TLV in Router Information LSA

   Each Profile ID listed indicates support for a given MRT Profile, as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture].  A Profile ID value
   of 0 corresponds to the default MRT profile.

   The GADAG Priority is the GADAG Root Selection Priority associated
   with the advertising router in the MRT Island for the associated MRT
   Profile, as indicated by the Profile ID.  If multiple MRT Profiles
   are supported, then the length of this TLV varies.  The ordering of
   the profiles inside the TLV is not significant.  Multiple appearances
   of this TLV is not an error.

   Lack of support for the default MRT profile is indicated by the
   presence of an MRT Profile TLV with a non-zero Profile ID value, and
   the absence of an MRT Profile TLV with a zero Profile ID value.

6.  Advertising MRT-ineligible links for MRT

   Due to administrative policy, some otherwise eligible links in the
   network topology may need to be excluded from the network graph upon
   which the MRT algorithm is run.  Since the same network graph must be
   used across the area, it is critical for OSPF to flood which links to
   exclude from the MRT calculation.  This is done by introducing a new
   MRT-Ineligible Link sub-TLV.  For OSPFv2, this sub-TLV is carried in
   the Extended Link TLV defined in [I-D.ietf-ospf-prefix-link-attr].
   For OSPFv3, this sub-TLV is carried in the Router-Link TLV defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-lsa-extend].

   If a link is marked by administrative policy as MRT-Ineligible, then
   a router MUST flood the OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV (or OSPFv3 Router-
   Link TLV) for that link, including the MRT-Ineligible Link sub-TLV.
   The OSPVv2 Extended Link TLV and OSPFv3 Router-Link TLV have area
   wide scope.

      LENGTH: 0


                        MRT-Ineligible Link sub-TLV

   This zero-length sub-TLV can appear in the OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV
   or the OSPFv3 Router-Link TLV.  Its presence indicates that the
   associated link MUST NOT be used in the MRT calculation for all
   profiles.

7.  Worst-Case Network Convergence Time

   As part of converging the network after a single failure,
   Section 12.2 of [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture] describes the
   need to wait for a configured or advertised period for all routers to
   be using their new SPTs.  Similarly, any work on avoiding micro-
   forwarding loops during convergence[RFC5715] requires determining the
   maximum among all routers in the area of the worst-case route

   computation and FIB installation time.  More details on the specific
   reasoning and need for flooding it are given in
   [I-D.atlas-bryant-shand-lf-timers].

      FIB compute/install time:  This is the worst-case time the router
          may take to compute and install all OSPF routes in the area
          after a change to a stable network.  The value is
          in milliseconds.


           Controlled Convergence TLV in Router Information LSA

   The Controlled Convergence TLV is carried in the Router Information
   LSA and flooded with area-wide scope.  The FIB compute/install time
   value sent by a router SHOULD be an estimate taking into account
   network scale or real-time measurements, or both.  Advertisements
   SHOULD be dampened to avoid frequent communication of small changes
   in the FIB compute/install time.

   A router receiving the Controlled Convergence sub-TLV SHOULD estimate
   the network convergence time as the maximum of the FIB compute/
   install times advertised by the routers in an area, including itself.
   In order to account for routers that do not advertise the Controlled
   Convergence sub-TLV, a router MAY use a locally configured minimum
   network convergence time as a lower bound on the computed network
   convergence time.  A router MAY use a locally configured maximum
   network convergence time as an upper bound on the computed network
   convergence time.

8.  Backwards Compatibility

   The MRT capability bit, the MRT Profile, the MRT-Ineligible Link, and
   the OSPFv3 MRT-Ineligible Link TLVs are defined in this document.
   They should not introduce any interoperability issues.  Routers that
   do not support the MRT capability bit in the router LSA SHOULD
   silently ignore it.  Routers that do not support the new MRT-related
   TLVs SHOULD silently ignore them.

Internet-Draft       OSPF Extensions to Support MRT         October 2015


8.1.  Handling MRT Capability Changes

   When a router changes from supporting MRT to not supporting MRT, it
   is possible that Router Information LSAs with MRT-related TLVs remain
   in the neighbors' database briefly.  Such MRT-related TLVs SHOULD be
   ignored when the associated Router LSA from that router does not have
   the M-bit set in its Router LSA.

   When a router changes from not supporting MRT to supporting MRT, it
   will flood its Router LSA(s) with the M-bit set and may send an
   updated Router Information LSA.  If a Router LSA is received with the
   M-bit newly set, an MRT computation SHOULD be scheduled but MAY be
   delayed up to 60 seconds to allow reception of updated related Router
   Information LSAs.  In general, when changes in MRT-related
   information are received, an MRT computation SHOULD be triggered.

   The rationale behind using the M-bit in the Router LSA is to properly
   handle the MRT capability changes in case of software version
   downgrade.  Without the M-bit mechanism, routers would need to rely
   only on the presence or absence of the MRT Profile TLV in the Router
   Information LSA to determine which other routers support MRT.  This
   could lead the to following scenario.  Router A is running a software
   version supporting MRT and has MRT enabled with profile 0.
   Therefore, router A advertises the MRT Profile TLV in the Router
   Information LSA, and other routers in the network store that RI LSA.
   Router A is downgraded to a version of software supporting neither
   MRT nor the Router Information LSA.  When router A restarts, it will
   not originate the RI LSA, since it doesn't support it.  However, the
   other routers in the network will still have a RI LSA from router A
   indicating support for MRT with profile 0.  This is an undesirable
   state.

   Requiring the M-bit in the Router LSA avoids this scenario.  Before
   the software downgrade, router A originates a Router LSA with the
   M-bit set.  After the software downgrade, router A will originate a
   new Router LSA with the M-bit unset.  The M bit in router LSA ensures
   the latest MRT capability information is available for computation
   when there is a downgrade to a version that doesn't support MRT and
   RI LSA.

10.  Security Considerations

   This OSPF extension is not believed to introduce new security
   concerns.  It relies upon the security architecture already provided
   for Router LSAs and Router Information LSAs.

11.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Anil Kumar SN for his suggestions and
   review.

12.  IANA Considerations

12.1.  M-bit

   IANA is requested to allocate the M-bit(value 0x20 in the router
   properties field of the Router-LSA) [RFC2328] [RFC4940] from the
   OSPFv2 Router Properties Registry.  The contents of the OSPFv2 Router
   Properties Registry after implementing the above request is shown
   below.

      Value Description Reference
      ----- ----------- ---------
      0x01  B-bit       [RFC2328]
      0x02  E-bit       [RFC2328]
      0x04  V-bit       [RFC2328]
      0x08  W-bit       [RFC1584]
      0x10  Nt-bit      [RFC3101]
      0x20  M-bit       [This draft]

   This document also defines the corresponding M-bit for OSPFv3 Router-
   LSAs.  [RFC4940] created several IANA registries for OSPFv2 and
   OSPFv3, including the OSPFv2 Router Properties Registry above.
   However, it did not create a corresponding OSPFv3 Router Properties
   Registry.  [RFC5340] discusses the corresponding OSPFv2 bits which
   were already defined at the time, and it indicates that those bits
   have the same meaning in OSPFv3 as in OSPFv2.  Therefore, it would be
   reasonable to assume that the OSPFv2 Router Properties Registry also
   applies to OSPFv3.  This documents requests that IANA make this
   assumption explicit in the following way.

   IANA is requested to rename the "OSPFv2 Router Properties Registry"
   to the "OSPF Router Properties Registry (both v2 and v3)".  The
   following text should remain in this document.

   The IANA registry "OSPF Router Properties Registry (both v2 and v3)"
   applies to the 8-bit field following the length field in the Router-
   LSA in both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

12.2.  MRT Profile and Controlled Convergence TLVs

   IANA is requested to allocate values for the following OSPF Router
   Information TLV Types [RFC4970]: MRT Profile TLV (TBA-MRT-OSPF-1),
   and Controlled Convergence TLV (TBA-MRT-OSPF-4).  The requested
   entries in the OSPF Router Information (RI) TLVs registry are shown

12.3.  MRT-Ineligible Link sub-TLV

   IANA is requested to allocate a value from the OSPF Extended Link TLV
   sub-TLV registry defined in [I-D.ietf-ospf-prefix-link-attr] for the
   MRT-Ineligible Link sub-TLV (TBA-MRT-OSPF-2).  The OSPF Extended Link
   TLV sub-TLV registry after implementing the above request is shown

   IANA is requested to allocate a value from the OSPFv3 Extended-LSA
   sub-TLV registry [I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-lsa-extend] for the MRT-
   Ineligible Link sub-TLV (TBA-MRT-OSPF-3).  The OSPFv3 Extended-LSA
   sub-TLV registry has not yet been created by IANA.
