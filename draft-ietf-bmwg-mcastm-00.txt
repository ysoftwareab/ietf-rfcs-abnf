Abstract

   The purpose of this draft is to describe methodology specific to  the
   benchmarking  of  multicast IP forwarding devices. It builds upon the
   tenets set forth in RFC 1944, RFC 2432 and  other  IETF  Benchmarking
   Methodology  Working  Group  (BMWG)  efforts.  This document seeks to
   extend these efforts to the multicast paradigm.

   The BMWG  produces  two  major  classes  of  documents:  Benchmarking
   Terminology  documents  and  Benchmarking  Methodology documents. The
   Terminology documents present the benchmarks and other related terms.
   The  Methodology  documents define the procedures required to collect
   the benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology documents.

1. Introduction

   This document defines a specific set of tests that vendors can use to
   measure  and  report  the  performance characteristics and forwarding
   capabilities of network devices that support IP multicast  protocols.
   The results of these tests will provide the user comparable data from
   different vendors with which to evaluate these devices.

   A previous document, " Terminology  for  IP  Multicast  Benchmarking"
   (RFC 2432), defined many of the terms that are used in this document.
   The terminology document should be  consulted  before  attempting  to
   make use of this document.

   This methodology will focus  on  one  source  to  many  destinations,
   although  many of the tests described may be extended to use multiple
   source to multiple destination IP multicast communication.

2. Key Words to Reflect Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",  "SHALL  NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

3. Test set up

   Figure 1 shows a typical setup for an IP  multicast  test,  with  one
   source  to  multiple  destinations,  although this MAY be extended to
   multiple source to multiple destinations.

   Generally , the destination ports first join the desired number of
   multicast groups by sending IGMP Join Group messages to the DUT.
   To verify that all destination ports successfully joined the
   appropriate groups, the source port MUST transmit IP multicast
   frames destined for these groups.

   In addition, all transmitted frames MUST contain a recognizable
   pattern that can be filtered on in order to ensure the receipt of only
   the frames that are involved in the test.

3.1  Test Considerations

3.1.1 IGMP Support

   Each of the receiving ports should support and be able to test both IGMP
      version 1 and IGMP version 2.

   Each receiving port should be able to respond to IGMP queries during the test.

   Each receiving port should also send LEAVE (running IGMP version 2) after each test.

3.1.2  Group Addresses

   The Class D Group address should be changed between tests.  Many
   DUTs have memory or cache that is not cleared properly and can
   bias the results.

3.1.3  Frame Sizes

   Each test should be run with different Multicast Frame Sizes.   The result to vary greatly.

3.1.4  TTL

   The source frames should have a TTL value large enough to accommodate the DUT/SUT.


4. Forwarding and Throughput

   This section contains the description of the tests that are related to the
   characterization of the packet forwarding of a DUT/SUT in a multicast
   environment. Some metrics extend the concept of throughput presented
   in RFC 1242. The notion of Forwarding Rate is cited in RFC 2285

   4.1 Mixed Class Throughput

   Definition
      The maximum rate at which none of the offered frames, comprised from a
      unicast Class and a multicast Class, to be forwarded are dropped by the

      device across a fixed number of ports.

   Procedure

      Multicast and unicast traffic are mixed together in the same aggregated
      traffic stream in order to simulate the non-homogenous networking
      environment. While the multicast traffic is transmitted from one source to
      multiple destinations, the unicast traffic MAY be evenly distributed across
      the DUT  architecture.  In addition, the DUT SHOULD learn the appropriate
      unicast IP addresses, either by sending ARP frames from each unicast address,
      sending a RIP packet or by assigning static entries into the DUT address
      table.

      The rates at which traffic is transmitted for both traffic classes MUST be
      set up in one of two ways:

      a) A percentage of the bandwidth is allocated for each traffic class and
         frames for each class are transmitted at the rate equal to the allocated
         bandwidth. For example, 64 byte frames can be transmitted at a theoretical
         maximum rate of 148810 frames/second. If 80 percent of the bandwidth is
         allocated for unicast traffic and 20 percent for multicast traffic, then
         unicast traffic will be sent at a maximum rate of 119048 frames/second and
         the multicast traffic at a rate of 29762 frames/second.

      b) Transmission rate is fixed for both traffic classes and a percentage of
         number of frames for each traffic class is specified. For example, if a
         fixed rate of 100% of theoretical maximum is desired, then 64 byte frames
         will be sent at 148810 frames/second for both unicast and multicast
         traffic. If 80 percent of the frames are to be unicast and 20 percent
         multicast, then for a duration of 10 seconds, 1190480 frames of unicast
         and 297620 frames of multicast will be sent. This fixed rate scenario
         actually over-subscribes the bandwidth, potentially causing congestion in
         the DUT.

      The transmission of the frames MUST be set up so that they form a
      deterministic distribution while still maintaining the specified bandwidth
      and transmission rates. See Appendix A for a discussion on determining an
      even distribution.

      Similar to the Frame loss rate test in RFC 1944, the first trial SHOULD be
      Run for the frame rate that corresponds to 100% of the maximum rate for the
      frame size on the input media. Repeat the procedure for the rate that
      corresponds to 90% of the maximum rate used and then for 80% of this rate.
      This sequence HOULD be continued (at reducing 10% intervals) until there are
      two successive trials in which no frames are lost. The maximum granularity of
      the trials MUST be 10% of the maximum rate, a finer granularity is
      encouraged.

   Result

      Transmit and Receive rates in frames per second for each source and
      destination port for both unicast and multicast traffic for each trial
      percent transmit rate. The result report SHOULD contain the number of
      frames transmitted and received per port per class type (unicast and
      multicast traffic), reported in number of frames and percent loss per port.

   4.2 Scaled Group Forwarding Matrix

   Definition:

       A table that demonstrates Forwarding Rate as a function of tested
       multicast groups for a fixed number of tested DUT/SUT ports.

   Procedure:

      Multicast traffic is sent at a fixed percent of line rate with a fixed
      number of receive ports at a fixed frame length.

      The receive ports will join an initial number of groups and the sender
      will transmit to the same groups after a certain delay (a few seconds).

      Then the receive ports will join an incremental value of groups and the
      transmit port will send to all groups joined (initial plus incremental).

      The receive ports will continue joining in the incremental fashion until a
      user defined maximum is reached.

   Results:

      For each group load the result WILL display frame rate, frames transmitted,
      total frames received, total frames loss, and percent loss.  The frame loss
      per receive port per group SHOULD also be available.


   4.3 Aggregated Multicast Throughput

   Definition:

      The maximum rate at which none of the offered frames to be
      forwarded through N destination interfaces of the same multicast
      group are dropped.

   Procedure:

      Multicast traffic is sent at a fixed percent of line rate with a fixed
      number of groups at a fixed frame length for a fixed duration of time.

      The initial number of receive ports will join the group(s) and the
      sender will transmit to the same groups after a certain delay (a few
      seconds).

      Then the an incremental number of receive ports will join the same groups
      and then the Multicast traffic is sent as stated.

      The receive ports will continue to be added and the Multicast traffic sent
      until a user defined maximum number of ports is reached.

   Results:

      For each number of receive ports the result WILL display frame rate, frames
      transmitted, total frames received, total frames loss, and percent loss.
      The frame loss per receive port per group SHOULD also be available.


4.4 Encapsulation (Tunneling) Throughput

   This sub-section provides the description of tests that help in obtaining
   throughput measurements when a DUT or a set of DUTs are acting as tunnel
   endpoints. The following Figure 2 presents the scenario for the tests.

                     ----------                   ----------

                                   Figure 2
                                   --------


   A tunnel is created between DUT A (the encapsulator) and DUT B (the
   decapsulator). Client A is acting as a source and Client B is the
   destination. Client B joins a multicast group (for example, 224.0.1.1) and it
   sends an IGMP Join message to DUT B to join that group. Client A now wants to
   transmit some traffic to Client B. It will send the multicast traffic to DUT
   A which encapsulates the multicast frames, sends it to DUT B which will
   decapsulate the same frames and forward them to Client B.

4.4.1 Encapsulation Throughput

Definition

   The maximum rate at which frames offered a DUT are encapsulated and correctly
   forwarded by the DUT without loss.

Procedure

   To test the forwarding rate of the DUT when it has to go through the process
   of encapsulation, a test port B is injected at the other end of DUT A
   (Figure B) that will receive the encapsulated frames and measure the
   throughput. Also, a test port A is used to generate multicast frames that
   will be passed through the tunnel.

   The following is the test setup:

      Test port A      DUT A                  Test port B

                     ---------- (c')      (d')---------
                     |        |-------------->|       |
      -------(a)  (b)|        |               |       |
      ||||||| -----> |        |      ------   ---------
      -------        |        |(c)  ( N/W  )
                     |        |---->(      )
                     ----------      ------

                                   Figure 3
                                   --------

   In Figure 2, a tunnel is created with the local IP address of DUT A as the
   beginning of the tunnel (point c) and the IP address of DUT B as the end
   of the tunnel (point d). DUT B is assumed to have the tunneling protocol
   enabled so that the frames can be decapsulated. When the test port B is
   inserted in between the DUT A and DUT B (Figure 3), the endpoint of tunnel
   has to be re-configured to be directed to the test port B's IP address. For
   example, in Figure 3, point c' would be  assigned as the beginning of the
   tunnel and point d' as the end of the tunnel. The test port B is acting as
   the end of the tunnel, and it does not have to support any tunneling protocol
   since the frames do not have to be decapsulated. Instead, the received
   encapsulated frames are used to calculate the throughput and other necessary
   measurements.

Result

   Throughput in frames per second for each destination port. The results
   should also contain the number of frames transmitted and received per port.

   4.4.2 Decapsulation Throughput

   Definition
      The maximum rate at which frames offered a DUT are decapsulated and correctly
      forwarded by the DUT without loss.

   Procedure

      The decapsulation process returns the tunneled unicast frames back to their
      multicast format. This test measures the throughput of the DUT when it has to
      perform the process of decapsulation, therefore, a test port C is used at the
      end of the tunnel to receive the decapsulated frames (Figure 4).

      Test port A       DUT A       Test port B     DUT B        Test port C

      -------        |        |      ------       |        |       -------
                     |        |                   |        |
                     ----------                   ----------

                                   Figure 4
                                   --------

      In Figure 4, the encapsulation process takes place in DUT A. This may
      effect the throughput of the DUT B. Therefore, two test ports should be
      used to separate the encapsulation and decapsulation processes. Client A
      is replaced with the test port A which will generate a multicast frame that
      will be encapsulated by DUT A. Another test port B is inserted between DUT
      A and DUT B that will receive the encapsulated frames and forward it to DUT
      B. Test port C will receive the decapsulated frames and measure the
      throughput.

   Result

      Throughput in frames per second for each destination port . The results
      should also contain the number of frames transmitted and received per port.

   4.4.3 Re-encapsulation Throughput

   Definition

      The maximum rate at which frames of one encapsulated format offered a DUT are
      converted to another encapsulated format and correctly forwarded by the DUT
      without loss.

   Procedure

      Re-encapsulation takes place in DUT B after test port C has received the
      decapsulated frames. These decapsulated frames will be re-inserted with
      a new encapsulation frame and sent to test port B which will measure the
      throughput. See Figure 5.

   Result

      Throughput in frames per second for each destination port. The results
      should also contain the number of frames transmitted and received per port.

   5. Forwarding Latency

      This section presents methodologies relating to the characterization of
      the forwarding latency of a DUT/SUT in a multicast environment.  It
      extends the concept of latency characterization presented in RFC 1944.

   5.1 Multicast Latency

   Definition

      The set of individual latencies from a single input port on the DUT or SUT to
      all tested ports belonging to the destination multicast group.

   Procedure

      According to RFC 1944, a tagged frame is sent half way through the
      transmission that contains a timestamp used for calculation of latency. In
      the multicast situation, a tagged frame is sent to all destinations for each
      multicast group and latency calculated on a per multicast group basis. Note
      that this test MUST be run using the transmission rate that is less than the
      multicast throughput of the DUT.

   5.2 Min/Max/Average Multicast Latency

   Definition:

      The difference between the maximum latency measurement and the
      minimum latency measurement from the set of latencies produced by
      the Multicast Latency benchmark.

   Procedure:

      For the entire duration of the Latency test the smallest latency, the
      largest latency, the sum of latencies, and the number should be tracked
      per receive port.

      The test can also increment bucket counters that represent a range latency
      range.  This can be used to create a histogram.  From the histogram, minimum,
      maximum, and average the test results can show the jitter.

   Results:

      For each port the results WILL display the number of frames, minimum latency,
      maximum latency, and the average latency.  The results SHOULD also display
      the histogram of latencies.


   6. Overhead

      This section presents methodology relating to the characterization of
      the overhead delays associated with explicit operations found in
      multicast environments.

   6.1 Group Join Delay

   Definition:

      The time duration it takes a DUT to start forwarding multicast
      packets from the time a successful IGMP group membership report
      has been issued to the DUT.

   Procedure:

      Traffic is sent on the source port at the same time as the IGMP JOIN Group
      message is transmitted from the destination ports.  The join delay is the
      difference in time from when the IGMP Join is sent and the first frame is
      received.

      One of the keys is to transmit at the fastest rate the DUT can handle multicast
      frames.  This is to get the best resultion in the Join Delay.  However, you

      do not want to transmit the frames to fast that frames are dropped by the DUT.

      The test should be ran using both IGMPv1 JOIN and IGMPv2 JOIN.

   Results:

      The JOIN delay for each port.


   6.2 Group Leave Delay

   Definition
      The time duration it takes a DUT to cease forwarding multicast packets after
      a corresponding IGMP "Leave Group" message has been successfully offered to
      the DUT.

   Procedure

      Traffic is sent on the source port at the same time as the IGMP Leave Group
      messages are transmitted from the destination ports. The frames on both the
      source and destination ports are sent with the timestamps inserted. The Group
      Leave Delay is the difference in the value of the timestamp A of the first
      IGMP Leave Group frame sent and the timestamp B of the last frame that is
      received on that destination port.

                      Group Leave delay = timestamp B - timestamp A

   Result

      Group Leave Delay values for each multicast group address on each destination
      port. Also, the number of frames transmitted and received, and percent loss
      may be displayed.

   8. Capacity
      This section offers terms relating to the identification of multicast
      group limits of a DUT/SUT.

8.1 Multicast Group Capacity

Definition:

   The maximum number of multicast groups a SUT/DUT can support while
   maintaining the ability to forward multicast frames to all
   multicast groups registered to that SUT/DUT.

Procedure:

      One or more receiving ports will join an initial number of groups.  Then

INTERNET-DRAFT   IP Multicast Benchmarking Methodology     February 1999


      after a delay the source port will transmit to each group at a transmission
      rate that the DUT can handle.   If all frames sent are forwarded and received
      the receiving ports will join an incremental value of groups.  Then after a
      a delay the source port will transmit to all groups at a transmission rate
      that the DUT can handle.  If all frames sent are forwarded and received the
      receiving ports will continuing joining and testing until a frame is not forwarded
      nor received.

      The group capacity resolution will be the incremental value.  So the capacity
      could be greater then last capacity passed but less then the one that failed.

      Once a capacity is determined the test should be re run with greater delays after
      the JOIN and a slower transmission rate.  And the initial group level should be
      raised to about five less then the previous capacity and incremental value should
      be set to one.

   Results:

      The number of groups passed vs the number of groups failed.  The results SHOULD
      give details when the frame fails to be forwarded about how many frames did and
      did not get forwarded.  Which groups DID and DID NOT get forwarded.


   9. Burdened Response

   9.1 Burdened Response

   Definition:

      A measured response collected from a DUT/SUT in light of
      interacting, or potentially interacting, distinct stimuli.

   Procedure:

      TBD

   Results:

      TBD


   9.2 Forwarding Burdened Multicast Latency

   Definition
      A multicast latency taken from a DUT/SUT in the presence of a traffic
      forwarding requirement.

      traffic forwarding requirement.

   Procedure:

      TBD

   Results:

      TBD



   Appendix A: Determining an even distribution

   A.1 Scope Of This Appendix

      This appendix discusses the suggested approach to configuring the   deterministic distribution methodology for tests that involve both multicast and unicast traffic classes in an aggregated traffic stream. As such, this appendix MUST not be read as an amendment to the methodology described in the body of this document but as a guide to testing practice.

      It is important to understand and fully define the distribution of frames among all multicast and unicast destinations.  If the distribution is not well defined or understood, the throughput and forwarding metrics are not meaningful.

   In a homogeneous environment, a large, single burst of multicast frames may be followed by a large burst of unicast frames. This is a very different distribution than that of a non-homogeneous environment, where the multicast and unicast frames are intermingled throughout the entire transmission.

   The recommended distribution is that of the non-homogeneous environment because it more closely represents a real-world scenario. The distribution is modeled by calculating the number of multicast frames per destination port as a burst, then calculating the number of unicast frames to transmit as a percentage of the total frames transmitted. The overall effect of the distribution is small bursts of multicast frames intermingled with small bursts of unicast frames.

   Example

      Frame size = 64
      Duration of test = 10 seconds
      Transmission rate = 100% of maximum rate
      Mapping for unicast traffic:    Port 1 to Port 2
                                      Port 3 to port 4
      Mapping for multicast traffic:  Port 1 to Ports 2,3,4
      Number of Multicast group addresses per destination port = 3
      Multicast groups joined by Port 2: 224.0.1.1
                                         224.0.1.2

                                         224,0.1.3
      Multicast groups joined by Port 3: 224.0.1.4
                                         224.0.1.5
                                         224,0.1.6
      Multicast groups joined by Port 4: 224.0.1.7
                                         224.0.1.8
                                         224,0.1.9

      Percentage of Unicast frames = 20
      Percentage of Multicast frames = 80
      Total number of frames to be transmitted = 148810 fps * 10 sec
                                               = 1488100 frames
      Number of unicast frames = 20/100 * 1488100 = 297620 frames
      Number of multicast frames = 80/100 * 1488100 = 1190480 frames

      Unicast burst size = 20 * 9 = 180
      Multicast burst size = 80 * 9 = 720
      Loop counter = 1488100 / 900 = 1653.4444 (round it off to 1653)

      Therefore, the actual number of frames that will be transmitted:
        Unicast frames = 1653 * 180 = 297540 frames
        Multicast frames = 1653 * 720 = 1190160 frames

      The following pattern will be established:

      UUUMMMMMMMMMMMMUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMUUUMMMMMMMMMMMM

      where     U represents 60 Unicast frames (UUU = 180 frames)
                M represents 60 Multicast frames (MMMMMMMMMMMM = 720 frames)

   As this document is solely for the purpose of providing metric methodology
   and describes neither a protocol nor a protocol's implementation, there
