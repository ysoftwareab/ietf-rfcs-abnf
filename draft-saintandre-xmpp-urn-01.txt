Internet-Draft      URN Namespace for XMPP Extensions      November 2006


1.  Introduction

   While the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as
   specified in [XMPP-CORE] and [XMPP-IM] provides basic messaging and
   presence funtionality, the fact that XMPP is at root a technology for
   streaming Extensible Markup Language [XML] data makes it possible to
   include virtually any structured information within XMPP, as long as
   such information is qualified by appropriate XML namespaces
   [XML-NAMES].  When sent over XMPP, such structured data formats and
   protocols are generally referred to as "XMPP extensions".

   A large number of such XMPP extensions exist.  The main standards
   development organization in which such extensions are defined is the
   Jabber Software Foundation (JSF), which contributed XMPP to the
   Inernet Standards Process.  Typically, such extensions are defined
   within the JSF's XMPP Extension Protocol (XEP) specification series.
   To date, the XML namespaces defined within the Jabber/XMPP community
   have used names of the form "jabber:*" (deprecated since early 2002)
   and "http://jabber.org/protocol/*" (not including names of the form
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-*" specified in the XMPP RFCs).
   However, it is desirable that names associated with future XMPP
   extensions be both unique and persistent, which is not necessarily
   the case with names that are also HTTP URLs.  Therefore, in
   accordance with the process defined in [MECHANISMS], this document
   registers a formal namespace identifier (NID) for Uniform Resource
   Names [URN] associated with XMPP extensions published in the JSF's
   XEP series and XML namespaces registered with the JSF's XMPP
   Registrar function [REGISTRAR].

Internet-Draft      URN Namespace for XMPP Extensions      November 2006


         Role: XMPP Registrar
         Email: registrar@jabber.org

   Declaration of Syntactic Structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the
      "xmpp" NID shall have the following structure:

         urn:xmpp:{ShortName}:{SubName}

      The keywords have the following meaning:

         (1) the "ShortName" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to
         the URN syntax requirements (see RFC 2141) and defines a
         particular protocol or format that is used as an XMPP
         extension

         (2) the "SubName" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to
         the URN syntax requirements (see RFC 2141) and defines a
         particular subset of the relevant protocol or format.

      The JSF's XMPP Registrar function shall be responsible for
      managing the assignment of both "ShortName" and "SubName"
      strings and maintaining a registry of resulting namespaces
      at <http://www.xmpp.org/registrar/namespaces.html>.  The
      XMPP Registrar may also assign URNs in sub-trees below the
      level of the ShortName or SubName as needed for use in various
      XMPP extensions.

   Relevant Ancillary Documentation:

      Information about the JSF's XMPP Registrar function can be
      found at <http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0053.html>
      and <http://www.xmpp.org/registrar/>.

   Identifier Uniqueness Considerations:

      The XMPP Registrar is already responsible for managing the
      assignment of XML namespace names of the form
      "http://jabber.org/protocol/{ShortName}" and
      "http://jabber.org/protocol/{ShortName}#{SubName}"
      (e.g., "http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub" and
      "http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info").  If the "xmpp"
      NID is approved, the XMPP Registrar shall simply modify the
      syntax of the namespace names it assigns from
      "http://jabber.org/protocol/{ShortName}" and
      "http://jabber.org/protocol/{ShortName}#{SubName}" to
      "urn:xmpp:{ShortName}" and "urn:xmpp:{ShortName}:{SubName}".

Internet-Draft      URN Namespace for XMPP Extensions      November 2006


      The XMPP Registrar shall ensure the uniqueness of all
      ShortName strings and of all SubName strings within the
      context of a given ShortName through checking such names
      against the list of existing namespace names (this process
      is not currently documented, but documentation may be added
      to XEP-0053, which is the controlling specification for the
      XMPP Registrar).  It is envisioned that the XMPP Registrar
      shall in all cases directly ensure the uniqueness of the
      assigned strings and that the XMPP Registrar shall not assign
      secondary responsibility for management of any sub-trees.
      However, the XMPP Registrar may assign URNs in sub-trees below
      the level of the ShortName or SubName as needed for use in
      various XMPP extensions.

      The resulting URNs shall not be re-assigned.

   Identifier Persistence Considerations:

      The XMPP Registrar shall provide clear documentation of the
      registered uses of the "xmpp" NID in the form of XMPP
      Extension Protocol (XEP) specifications published at
      <http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/> as well as a
      registry of the registered namespaces themselves at
      <http://www.xmpp.org/registrar/namespaces.html>.

   Process of Identifier Assignment:

      The XMPP Registrar's processes for ShortName and SubName
      assignment are not currently documented, but such strings
      are typically generated by the author of the relevant XMPP
      Extension Protocol specification and checked by the XMPP
      Registrar against the list of existing namespace names to
      ensure relevance, memorability, and uniqueness
      (documentation of this process may be added to XEP-0053,
      which is the controlling specification for the XMPP
      Registrar).  Assignment of URNs within the "xmpp" tree is
      reserved to the Jabber Software Foundation, specifically
      to its XMPP Registrar function as specified in XEP-0053.

   Process for Identifier Resolution:

      The namespace is not currently listed with a Resolution
      Discovery System (RDS), but nothing about the namespace
      prohibits the future definition of appropriate resolution
      methods or listing with an RDS.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

Internet-Draft      URN Namespace for XMPP Extensions      November 2006


      No special considerations; the rules for lexical
      equivalence specified in RFC 2141 apply.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations.

   Validation Mechanism:

      None specified.

   Scope:

      Global.


3.  Namespace Considerations

   The standards work of the Jabber Software Foundation has been in
   progress since August 2001 and is expected to continue for the
   foreseeable future.  The old-style "jabber:*" namespace names
   originally used in the Jabber open-source community were not proper
   URNs or URIs and thus were deprecated in early 2002.  Since then, the
   namespace names assigned by the XMPP Registrar function of the Jabber
   Software Foundation have been (equivalent to) specialized HTTP URLs
   whose authority component is "jabber.org".  While that domain is
   currently under the control of the Jabber Software Foundation, there
   is no guarantee that it will always remain so, thus potentially
   threatening the reliability and permanence of the assigned namespace
   names.  The use of Uniform Resource Names with an appropriate
   Namespace ID will enable the Jabber Software Foundation to assign
   cleaner, more general, more permanent, more reliable, and more
   controllable namespace names related to the XMPP extensions it
   defines, while keeping the tree of XMPP extensions properly separate
   from the IETF tree used to define some of the core XMPP namespaces.


4.  Community Considerations

   The Jabber/XMPP standards development community will benefit from
   publication of this namespace by having more permanent and reliable
   names for the XML namespaces defined in XMPP Extension Protocol
   specifications produced by the JSF.

   The standards process followed by the JSF is open to contributions
   from any interested individual; such a contribution takes the form of
   a proposal submitted to the XMPP Extensions Editor
   <mailto:editor@jabber.org>, accepted by the XMPP Council

Internet-Draft      URN Namespace for XMPP Extensions      November 2006


   <http://www.xmpp.org/council/>, and published in the JSF's XMPP
   Extension Protocol (XEP) series at <http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/>.
   It is envisioned that, as at present, use of the proposed space for a
   particular XML format or protocol extension will be contingent upon
   advancement of the appropriate specification within the JSF's
   standards process as documented in XEP-0001
   <http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html>.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no additional security considerations other
   than those associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a URN NID registration of "xmpp", which shall
   be entered into the IANA registry located at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces>.
