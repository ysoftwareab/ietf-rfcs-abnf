          2.  Introduction

          When designing a MIB module, it is often useful to define new
          types similar to those defined in the SMI.  In comparison to a
          type defined in the SMI, each of these new types has a
          different name, a similar syntax, but a more precise
          semantics.  These newly defined types are termed textual
          conventions, and are used for the convenience of humans
          reading the MIB module.  This is done through Textual
          Conventions as defined in RFC1903[1].  It is the purpose of
          this document to define the set of textual conventions to be
          used when performance history based on 15 minute intervals is
          kept. See for example the Trunk MIB modules [3][4][5].

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.
