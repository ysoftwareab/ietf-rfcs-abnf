Abstract
   It is service that ENUM replaces existent IP by telephone number and
   a user does various kinds devices so that is available by one 
   peculiar number. As this ENUM's DNS becomes bulky, we need monitoring 
   for ENUM. There is MIB to monitoring method that is used present. 
   We propose standard for efficient ENUM DNS administration applying 
   extension MIB that is this MIB's extension to ENUM.

1. Introduction
   Enum uses one number as telephone numbering mapping's acronym, it is 
   doing service so that can interlock to device to user. ENUM uses to 
   store and manage, for ENUM number using ENUM DNS. ENUM DNS does 
   function such as existent DNS. Therefore, this ENUM DNS as existent
   DNS MIB's uses require. MIB is monitoring service that manage DNS's 
   structure or computers basically. MIB comes out MIBv1 to visual
   point at present MIBv2, and extension MIB. MIB creates, manages and 
   uses each object using SNMP protocol. So, this document uses 
   extension MIB that is used present, ENUM DNS monitoring do if use 
   this way by method to understand ENUM DNS's administration and uses
   many helps.

2. Terminology

   ASN: Abstract Syntax Notation 
   DNS: Domain Name Server
   ENUM: ENUM is standard that is selected by IETF. It is used being 
         mapped in telephone number that turn DNS to web address or URL.
   MIB: Management Information Base
   NMS: Network Management System. Software that system administrator is
        used controlling network
   SNMP: Simple Network Management Protocol. Protocol that watch and 
         control network supervision and action of network device    
      
3. Requirements

3.1 MIB

   MIB is Network administration's primary that exchange specific 
   information between Manager and Agent. Specific information and
   resource that should be managed are known as object. Set that 
   assemble these objects is MIB. Network management means that receive
   specific value among MIB that device offer and then grasp state of 
   the equipment or change the value receiving specification value among
   MIB that devices offer. Network management means that receive specific 
   value among MIB that devices -host such as workstation, printer/file 
   server of course and communications equipment such as hub, router,

   switch- offer and then grasp state of the equipment or change the 
   value. Alteration of value can alter relevant MIB's String or value 
   as well as state of devices through alteration and can instruct and 
   run regular function in the device. That is, it can keep away 
   transmission to specification port of hub as well as forbid 
   communication of relevant device by correcting Interface's management
   value. Also it can reset HUB through altering specific MIB. SMI that
   is Framework that define and construct MIB defined the following 
   item in RFC1155.

    1.Each objects of MIB are defined using ASN.1 that is standardized
      and developed language by ISO(ISO 8824) and ITU-T(X.208)

    2. All objects must have name, syntax, and encoding name - Object 
       identification data that identify object Syntax - Data type of 
       object (e.g. INTEGER, OCTET STRING etc) Encoding - What BIT 
       pattern is object data transmitted?

    3. MIB is defined usable thing and allowed structure in SNMP of data
       class is defined in ASN.1.

   MIB structure is forming stratified Tree structure. Specific object
   is identified by object identification(OID). Actually, OID is not
   character that we use usually but serial integer. MIB Tree is decided
   OID by way to sort objects belonging to equal category in the root 
   and SNMP can read and write Leaf that is end node. For example, 
   information in system location is not sysLocation of OID and is 
   "1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6". And this object can read and write but system
   ("1.3.6.1.2.1.1") that is parents object can't read or write. If want
   to read all "sysDescr, sysObjectID, ... ,sysServices" that is low
   level object that follow hereupon, must ask to Agent specifying 
   "1 ~ 7" OID. Most NMS receive value by Designating system group. In 
   actuality operate with upside and get. SNMP SMI specifies 
   "internet(1)"  by "ISO(1) org(3) dod(6)" Sub-Tree, and define 
   enterprises by "internet(1)" Sub-Tree and directory(1) , mgmt(2) ,
   experimental(3), private(4) and private(4) Sub-Tree. MIB that only 
   own company which is not defined by SNMP MIB standard offers can 
   define to private(4) enterprises(1). But, MIB must have OID that 
   distinguish all companies. It is managing in IANA (Internet Assigned
   Number Authority). Therefore, MIB should be given OID to IANA for
   implementation of private Enterprises MIB If is like this, uniqueness
   of the low rank MIB's object is guaranteed. Therefore, It is possible
   that MIB distinguishes with other company's private MIB

4. Protocol Details

4.1 Extended MIB design method for monitor application of ENUM

   (1) MIB is largely distinguished by standard MIB and non-standard 
       MIB. Standard MIB is MIB that is established by standard like 
       MIB-1 and MIB-2, non-standard MIB can use extending existent MIB.
       Therefore, We will use the non-standard MIB.

Internet-Draft             Extension MIB for ENUM           October 2005

   (2) Design of MIB firstly define administration object via specific 
       of target design and make table according to value specific

   (3) Individual MIB allocates new object identification data under all
       enterprises or selects one among object identification data 
       that is not registered or individual MIB makes it.

   (4) After creating OID by necessity, MIB makes MIB tree structure 
       under enterprises Allocating identification data of objects

   (5) Access competence, explanation, object identification and type of
       administration object defines MIB according to SMI(Structure of 
       Management Information) using ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax notation.1)

4.2 MIB application way of ENUM

   MIB is largely distinguished by MIB for hardware administration and 
   MIB for software administration. Therefore, to think appliable MIB in
   ENUM, We can see hardware MIB system that can be monitoring traffic 
   amount of ENUM devices and software MIB system that can be monitoring
   traffic amount of packet in ENUM DNS. However, that normalize 
   hardware MIB is expected to be difficult because Standard enactment 
   among devices. Therefore, way for standardization propulsion may have
   better establish software MIB.

   <Figure 1> is MIB tree structure that implements software MIB 
   adaptively in ENUM environment. To explain above shown picture, 
   Internet (1 3 6 1) is basic object that use in MIB and the side 
   number means ID. Extended MIB defines in enterprise (1) in basis 
   MIB's private (4) object inside of Internet (1 3 6 1) object.
   Enobject (99) means object to use in ENUM and ID 99 is the number 
   that decide carelessly

5. Security Considerations
   More improvement way that is proposed in after through performance 
   estimation, and security part that is limitation of mobile 
   environment and DRM part that can protect intellectual property of
   multimedia contents research about works that need.
