Abstract

   This document proposes a way for IPv6 nodes (clients) to offer
   credentials to a local AAA in order to be granted access to the local
   network.  Whereas for IPv4 it is not clear that routers and DHCP will
   be equipped to handle such functions, we believe that it is more
   efficient and thus reasonable to expect such access controls to be
   exerted by IPv6 routers, possibly as part of performing their role as
   DHCPv6 relays.  DHCPv6 servers and routers are expected to work in
   conjunction with AAA servers to determine whether or not the client's
   credentials are valid.

   network.  Whereas for IPv4 it is not clear that routers and DHCP will
   be equipped to handle such functions, we believe that it is more
   efficient and thus reasonable to expect such access controls to be
   exerted by IPv6 routers, possibly as part of performing their role as
   DHCPv6 relays.  DHCPv6 servers and routers are expected to work in
   conjunction with AAA servers to determine whether or not the client's
   credentials are valid.

   Routers can exert such network access control by the device of
   carefully controlling entries in their Neighbor Cache.  If a device
   does not supply verifiable credentials, then the router SHOULD NOT
   forward packets to that device.  Furthermore, such uncredentialed
   devices should have no access (or perhaps only very limited access)
   to the other network links adjacent to the router.  Only in this
   way can a new device be prevented from abusing network connectivity
   before its authorization is complete.


2. Terminology

   This document makes use of many terms defined in recent AAA
   requirements documents (for example, [4]).  The general framework
   consists of the following nodes:

                Local Domain                      Home Domain
              +------------------------+        +--------------+
              |   +------+             |        |   +------+   |
              |   |      |             |        |   |      |   |
              |   | AAAL |             |        |   | AAAH |   |
              |   |      +--------------------------+      |   |
              |   +---+--+             |        |   +------+   |

              |       |    \ | other|  |        +--------------+
   +------+   |   +---+--+  +------+|  |
   |      |   |   |      |  |      ||  |    C     =  client
   |   C  |- -|- -|   A  |  |   F  |+  |    A     =  attendant
   |      |   |   |      |  |      |   |    F     =  packet filter
   +------+   |   +------+  +------+   |    other =  other nodes
              |                        |    AAAL  =  local authority
              +------------------------+    AAAH  =  home authority

      Client

         The host requesting access to the network.

      Attendant

         The server that extracts the client's NAI and AAA authorization
         data from the protocol messages sending them to the AAAL for
         verification.

      Packet filter

         A packet filter/firewall/security gateway (?)  or equal
         functionality filtering out unauthorized datagram traffic.

      AAAL

         The AAA server in the foreign domain that provides local access
         to the AAA infrastructure.

      AAAH

         The Home AAA server/domain which is able to authorize each of
         its clients.

      Other nodes

         Other hosts that perform some function as a result of the
         policy received from the AAAH, e.g.  charging, QoS, etc.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [3].


3. General Framework

   Using the terminology just introduced, in this section we describe
   the general framework for our proposals.

   The client accessing the network uses some protocol to solicit access
   to the network it has been attached.  Protocols considered in this
   document include Stateless Autoconfiguration [5] and DHCPv6 [2], the
   latter as an example of a stateful autoconfiguration service.  We
   also provide a comparison and discussion of the applicability to
   DHCPv4.

   A NAI [1] is typically used to convey the user's identity.  Data
   confirming the authorization of the identity claimed in the NAI to
   the AAA infrastructure is sent sent separately from the NAI. Both the
   NAI and the AAA data are embedded in extensions of the protocol used
   in accessing the network.

Internet Draft                AAA for IPv6                 10 March 2000


   The attendant functionality is provided by the node receiving the
   messages sent by the client.  The functionality of the attendant
   includes extracting the NAI and the AAA data from the protocol and
   sending them to the Local AAA server.  The NAI and the AAA data
   will most likely be opaque to the attendant, the attendant should
   therefore not try to decipher these.  Granting network access to a
   client while waiting for a reply from the AAAL the attendant should
   be a local policy decision.  Based on the reply from the AAAL the
   attendant either accepts or denies the request for network access.
   The AAAL may also hand out keys with a finite lifetime to be used
   for authentication subsequent protocol messages.  The AAAL/AAAH may
   also need to send information to the node.  Such information will be
   opaque to the attendant and must be sent to the client.

      // Comment:  Thomas, let not the above description confuse
      you about writing the other Stateless Autoconfiguration
      scenario :-).

      // Comment:  a MN-AAA extension used for authorization/
      authentication to the AAA system.  Use the AAA extension
      in both directions, since AAA may want to send some
      "policy"/key information to the host/client?

   The AAAL may also control other nodes in order to satisfy the policy
   requirements demanded by the AAA infrastructure, especially the AAAH.
   These include for example charging, QoS, datagram filtering, etc.

      // Comment:  How do we distinguish between sending the AAA
      message in the Router Solicitation and using DHCPv6 to do
      the same?  Local policy?


3.1. Client requirements

   The client is required to provide identification and credentials
   to the local AAA infrastructure.  The identification should enable
   the AAAL to identify a suitable AAAH for carrying out all necessary
   authorization steps.  The identification will typically take the form
   of a NAI, thus identifying both the user and the appropriate home
   domain.


3.2. Attendant requirements

   The Attendant is required to:

    -  uniquely map clients to/from requests to the AAAL





Asokan, Eklund, Flykt, Perkins    Expires 10 September 2000     [Page 4]

Internet Draft                AAA for IPv6                 10 March 2000


    -  perform authentication of the protocol messages and to delete
       expired authentication keys if the necessary keys have been
       distributed to be used between the client and the attendant


3.3. AAAL requirements

   The AAAL is required to:

    -  map AAA request/replies between the attendants and the AAA
       infrastructure


3.4. Requirements for other nodes

4. Instantiation with Stateless autoconfiguration

   AAA authorization can be tied to IPv6 stateless address
   autoconfiguration.  In this case the router acts as an AAA attendant.
   The basic idea is to make the router add an entry for a host in
   its neighbor cache only if AAA authorization for the host has been
   successful.  When an IPv6 host starts up in a subnet, it sends
   a router solicitation with extensions to carry the NAI and AAA
   credentials.  The router will extract AAA credentials and forward
   them to AAAL. If authorization is successful, the router can add an
   entry for the host in its neighbor cache.  This way unauthorized
   hosts will not be able to receive incoming packets destined to them.
   The router will then convey the result of the authorization to the
   host by sending a solicited Router Advertisement with the AAA Reply
   extension.

      // Comment:  Should the router include a bit in unsolicited
      router advertisements stating that AAA authorization is
      necessary?


4.1. Message formats

4.1.1. NAI option

   The NAI option to Router Solicitation is used to convey the NAI of
   the user/host to the AAAL.

4.2. Router considerations

   If a router receives a Router Solicitation with the AAA Credential
   option, it must send back solicited Router Advertisement with the AAA
   Reply option.


4.3. Host considerations

   [TODO]


5. Instantiation with DHCPv6

   When a DHCP client needs to allocate an IPv6 address, it will first
   send DHCP Solicit messages soliciting for the DHCP servers serving
   the network.  The DHCP servers receiving the solicitation will reply
   by sending DHCP Advertise messages to the client.

      // Comment:  Should the DHCP server include a bit stating
      that AAA authorization is necessary?

   If AAA authorization is needed for the network, the DHCP client
   will add an MN-NAI extension containing the DHCP client's NAI and a
   MN-AAA extension containing AAA data to the DHCP Request message.
   The DHCP server receiving the DHCP Request extracts both the NAI and
   the AAA data from the extensions and sends these to the AAAL. The
   AAAL uses the AAA network to forward the AAA data to the AAAH. The
   AAAH will processes the AAA data and form a reply to the AAAL. The

   reply may contain keys, policy information, etc.  targeted to the
   AAAL, the DHCP server and the DHCP client.  The AAAL will identify
   which information should be given to the DHCP server (e.g.  keys) and
   which should be applied locally to the network (e.g.  policy).  The
   data that the AAAH sends to the DHCP client (e.g.  keys, policy) will
   be treated as opaque and forwarded by the AAAL to the DHCP server.
   Based on the reply from the AAAL, the DHCP server will create a DHCP
   Reply either accepting or denying the address lease.  The opaque AAA
   data received from the AAAL is inserted in the MN-AAA extension in
   the DHCP Reply message.

      // Comment:  Should keys have their own extensions instead
      of reusing the MN-AAA extension?

      // Comment:  What is the visible effect of router control
      over Neighbor Cache entries upon reception of DHCP Reply?


5.1. MN-NAI extension

   A DHCP client adds the MN-NAI extension to its DHCP Request whenever
   it needs to transmit its NAI to the local AAA service.

                      and Length fields.

      NAI             This field contains a NAI formatted according to
                      RFC2486 [1].


5.2. MN-AAA extension

   The MN-AAA extension contains AAA data that the DHCP client wants to
   present to the AAA domain.  The MN-AAA extension is also used by the
   DHCP server forwarding AAA data destined to the DHCP client.

      Type            The Type field identifies the extension as being
                      an MN-AAA extension and has a yet undefined value.

      Length          The Length field gives the length measured in
                      octets of this extension not including the Type
                      and Length fields.

      AAA data        Data sent to/from the AAA domain.


5.3. DHCP client considerations

   When the DHCP client solicits for an address in a network that
   requires AAA authorization, the DHCP client sends the needed
   authorization data in a MN-AAA extension in the DHCP Request message.
   A MN-NAI extension identifying the client MUST be included in the
   DHCP Request containing the MN-AAA extension.  If there exists and
   DHCP security association between the DHCP client and the DHCP
   server, the DHCP Request message MUST be protected by that security
   association.  The security association may have been generated at the
   time of the previous request of the address.

   Upon receiving the DHCP Reply the DHCP client has to be ready for the
   following to happen:

    -  The 'status' field of the DHCP Reply indicates that the address
       has been successfully leased to the DHCP client.  If the DHCP
       Reply is secured by an authentication extension, the correctness
       of the authentication extension is checked.  If the security
       association for the authentication extension does not exist,
       the DHCP client will first examine the MN-AAA extension for
       keys, etc.  needed to create the security association.  If such
       information is present, the client creates the needed security
       association and retries to verify the correctness of the message.

    -  The 'status' field indicates success but no MN-AAA extension is
       present.  The DHCP client will start using the leased address as
       normal.

    -  The 'status' field indicates that the AAA authorizations has
       failed.  The DHCP client is unable to gain access in the network.

    -  The 'status' field indicates any other error condition.  The DHCP
       client continues according to the DHCP protocol.

      // Comment:  These "bullet points" probably need to evolve
      more to an exact "flow chart"?


5.4. DHCP relay considerations

   A DHCP relay receiving a MN-NAI or a MN-AAA extension MUST forward
   these extensions unaltered between the client and the server.


5.5. DHCP server considerations

      // Comment:  Setting an "AAA" bit in the DHCP Advertise
      message?

   A DHCP server receiving the MN-AAA and MN-NAI extensions SHOULD
   extract and forward both the NAI and the AAA data to the AAAL.
   Depending on the local policy and/or the capability of the DHCP
   server, the DHCP server may choose to ignore the information
   contained in the MN-NAI and MN-AAA extensions.  In this case the
   server may skip the extensions, and only using the extensions when
   verifying a possible authentication extension for the message.

   Prior to sending the NAI and the AAA data to the AAAL, the DHCP
   server may check the correctness of the rest of the message.  It is
   assumed that the AAA processing will require time and computational
   power, which would be in vain if some of the information contained
   later on in the message would be incorrect.

   If the AAA system sends data back to the DHCP client, the DHCP
   server MUST include this data in an MN-AAA extension in the DHCP
   Reply message.  If there is no such data present, the DHCP server
   will not add a MN-AAA extension to the DHCP Reply message.  The
   DHCP server will indicate an AAA failure reported by the AAAL
   by setting the 'status' field in the DHCP Reply message to 'AAA
   Failed Authentication', which has the value TBD. The AAAL might
   also distribute keys together with a lifetime to be used in the
   authentication of further DHCP messages.  In this case the DHCP
   server will add the proper authentication extension to the DHCP Reply
   and any further messages.

5.6. DHCPv4

   As DHCPv4 is very similar to DHCPv6, the same messaging sequence can
   be applied to DHCPv4.  The DHCPv6 Solicit message maps to the DHCPv4
   Discover message, the DHCPv6 Advertise to the DHCPv4 Offer message,
   the DHCPv6 Request to the DHCPv4 Request message and the DHCPv6
   Reply to the DHCPv4 Ack message.  However, there is one fundamental
   difference:  the length of an DHCPv4 extension cannot exceed 255
   octets.  There exists a draft describing a solution to the length
   problem, which is a real problem only if either one of the extensions
   need sizes longer than 255 octets.


6. Packet filtering functions

      // Comment:  Here we put the discussion of packet
      filering and security gateways and their respective
      benefits/drawbacks.


7. Discussion

      // Comment:  Here we put unresolved and alternative
      scenarios.


7.1. Direct interaction with AAAL

   An alternative approach would be to require that IPv6 nodes support
   AAA client functionality.  Router advertisements will contain an
   extension indicating the IP address of the AAA server in a subnet.
   The IPv6 node should send its credentials directly to the AAA server.
