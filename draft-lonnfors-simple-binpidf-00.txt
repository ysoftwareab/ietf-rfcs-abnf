Abstract

   This memo specifies a methodology whereby external content to a
   presence information document can be referenced in XML encoded
   presence information document (PIDF). The external content can be
   either transferred directly in the payload of SIP messages or
   indirectly as an HTTP reference. The external part might contain
   binary data such as images.

Internet-Draft                  BINPIDF                       April 2003


1. Introduction

   The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) is described in [2]. It
   defines a generic XML encoded format to express a presentity's
   presence information. However, it does not specify any mechanism how
   external objects, e.g. pictures, belonging to presence information
   can be represented in such XML documents.

   The Content Indirection document [4] provides an extension to the URL
   MIME External-Body Access-Type [8] to allow any MIME part in a SIP
   message to be referred indirectly via a URL. In addition there is a
   need to specify an extension to PIDF in order to use the Content
   Indirection mechanism for the Presence in a way that the XML encoded
   presence information is carried directly in SIP message while
   external objects are referenced indirectly.

   There is also need to deliver the external objects in the payload of
   a SIP message. The MIME Multipart/Related content type [6] provides a
   good basis for placing a reference to external contents as
   multiparts. An extension to PIDF is needed for referencing the
   multiparts from the PIDF XML formatted presence information. A
   similar kind of approach of utilizing the MIME Multipart/Related with
   HTML can be found in [7].

2. Conventions

   In this document, the key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED',
   'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY',
   and 'OPTIONAL' are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1]
   and indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

3. Overview of Operation

   This section provides an overview of operation for having references
   to external objects (direct and indirect content) in presence
   information.

   The external object can be embedded as one part of a multipart
   payload of the SIP message, can be stored at an external location
   where the multipart payload includes a URL to external object using
   Content Indirection [4], or the PIDF XML part can directly contain
   URL link to the content. The MIME Multipart/Related content type [6]
   is used for direct delivery of the external object.

   The presence information data format is extended with a content id
   (CId) and external link (ExtLink) XML elements. Each separate
   external content has its own CId or ExtLink value within presence
   information. The value of CId is the Content ID of the external

Internet-Draft                  BINPIDF                       April 2003


   object part in the multipart payload. The value of the ExtLink is a
   URL to the location where the external content can be fetched.

4. BINPIDF Elements

4.1 Namespace

   The namespace declaration to the PIDF extension specified in this
   document is 'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf-ext-cont'.

4.2 'CId' Element

   The 'CId' XML element contains a reference to the part in the
   multipart payload where either the content can be directly found or
   where further information can be found about the external body. The
   CId value corresponds to the Content ID parameter of the multipart
   made according to MIME Multipart/Related content type [6].

4.3 'ExtLink' Element

   The 'ExtLink' XML element contains an URL [9] to a location where the
   external content can be fetched.

5. How To Utilize this Specification

   This chapter describes how the payload of SIP messages is composed
   when there is a need to convey external objects to XML encoded
   presence information document between the client and presence server.

   Three different methods are presented in the subsections below
   whereby external objects can be delivered: direct link to external
   content within PIDF based XML document, and reference to multipart
   having either the content of the external object embedded or a URL
   (and other information) to external location where the content is
   stored.

   The client is able to indicate the support for different types of
   external objects and the ways of delivering the contents within the
   SIP message using the Accept header in the SIP SUBSCRIBE request. The
   server handling the message uses the content types supported by the
   client for delivering the external objects.

5.1 Direct Link to External Content

   The ExtLink XML element is included in PIDF to point to the location
   where the external content is stored. The used content type in the
   SIP message is one of the normal content type(s) of presence service.

Internet-Draft                  BINPIDF                       April 2003


5.2 Reference to Multipart where External Object is Embedded

   The content type of the SIP message and the multiparts of the payload
   are composed according to [6] (MIME Multipart/Related). The XML
   encoded presence information in PIDF is the 'root' of the body part.
   The CId XML element is used within presence information in PIDF to
   reference to the multipart where the content of the external object
   is found.

5.3 Reference to Multipart where Link and Another Information about the
    External Object is Found

   The content type of the SIP message and the multiparts of the payload
   are composed according to [6] (MIME Multipart/Related). The XML
   encoded presence information in PIDF is the 'root' of the body part.
   The CId XML element is used within presence information in PIDF to
   reference the part in the multipart payload where the additional
   information (e.g., URL) of the external object is found. The
   multipart of the external object is composed according to [4].

6. Examples

6.1 Binary Objects both Directly Embedded and Indirectly Referenced in
    Multiparts

   Presence information subscription from client to server:

      SUBSCRIBE sip:john@pres.example.com SIP/2.0
      Via: SIP/2.0/TCP xxxxx;branch=z9hG4bKwYb6QREiCL
      Max-Forwards: 70
      To: <sip:john@pres.example.com>
      From: <sip:adam@example.com>;tag=ie4hbb8t
      Call-ID: cdB34qLToC@terminal.example.com
      CSeq: 322723822 SUBSCRIBE
      Contact: xxxx
      Event: presence
      Expires: 7200
      Accept: application/cpim-pidf+xml
      Accept: multipart/related
      Accept: message/external-body, text/html, text/plain, image/*
      Content-Length: 0

   	(200 OK are omitted)

   The NOTIFY looks like:

      NOTIFY sip:terminal.example.com SIP/2.0
      Via: SIP/2.0/TCP pres.example.com;branch=z9hG4bKMgRenTETmm
