1.  Introduction

   The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) provides confidentiality for
   IP datagrams by encrypting the payload data to be protected.  Depend-
   ing on the user's security requirements, either an upper protocol-
   layer segment (such as TCP or UDP) is encrypted (transport-mode), or
   an entire IP datagram is encrypted and tunneled to the destination
   within another IP datagram (tunnel-mode).

   To work properly without changing the entire Internet infrastructure
   (particularly non-participating routers), ESP is carried in a data-
   gram with transparent IP headers.  The information in these outer IP
   headers is used to route the protected datagram.

   For more details about ESP in various network environments, see
   "Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol" [RFC-1825x].  That
   document provides important background for this specification, such
   as an explanation of Security Associations, forms of Security Associ-
   ation management, guidelines on transport and tunnel modes of opera-
   tion, and interaction between ESP and the Authentication Header (AH)
   [RFC-1826x].

   ESP may optionally provide authentication and integrity.  Users
   desiring authentication and/or integrity without confidentiality
   should use AH instead of ESP.

   ESP may also provide a form of anti-replay service, depending upon
   the selection of integrity.  The enforcement of replay protection is
   solely at the discretion of the receiver.

   Security services can be provided between:

   -  a pair of single user hosts,

   -  a single user host and a security firewall router, or

   -  a pair of firewall routers.

   In the latter case, together with the tunnel mode of encapsulation,
   ESP may provide traffic flow confidentiality.  Traffic aggregation at
   the firewalls may be able to mask source to destination patterns of
   the protected internal users.

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST", "optional", "recom-
   mended", "required", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be inter-
   preted as described in [RFC-2119].

1.1.  Performance

   Use of this specification will increase the protocol processing costs
   in participating systems, and will also increase the communications
   latency.  The increased latency is primarily due to time required for
   encryption and decryption of each datagram.  This can be very time
   intensive to implement.


1.2.  Construction

   ESP will always appear as the final payload header.  The header imme-
   diately preceding the ESP Header will contain the value 50 (0x32) in
   its Next Header (Protocol) field.

    <--             Transparent              --> <-- Opaque -->
   +-----------+-----------------+--------------+--------------+
   | IP Header |  other headers  |  ESP Header  |   ESP Data   |
   +-----------+-----------------+--------------+--------------+

   The Encapsulating Security Payload has two components.

   The transparent ESP Header consists of the unencrypted field(s) of
   the payload.  The transparent field(s) of the unencrypted ESP Header
   inform the intended recipient how to properly process the opaque
   data.

   The opaque ESP Data consists of protected fields for the ESP trans-
   form(s).


1.3.  Transforms

   Cipher and authenticator algorithms, and the precise format of opaque
   ESP data associated with them, are known as "ESP transforms".  It is
   intended that the ESP format should be sufficiently general to permit
   the specification of new transforms as new cryptographic algorithms
   are developed.

   The parameter description requirements for companion transform docu-
   ments are described in [RFC-ffff].

   When the authenticator transform requires a separate key, that key is
   generated after any cipher keys.

   All fields are transmitted in network order (most significant byte
   first).

   Fields that may be authenticated are designated by a trailing A.

   Fields that may be encrypted are designated by a trailing E.


2.1.  Security Parameters Index (SPI)

   The SPI is a 32-bit (4 byte) unsigned value identifying the Security
   Association parameters for the ESP transform.  The value is relative
   to the IP Destination in the preceding IP Header of the datagram.

   The use of this value is orthogonal to usage of similar values by
   other related security protocols, such as the Authentication Header
   (AH).  That is, the same value MAY be used by multiple protocols to
   concurrently indicate different Security Association parameters.

   The value zero (0) indicates that no Security Association has been
   established, and is primarily used for testing.

   Values in the range 1 through 255 are reserved to the Internet
   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for future use.  A reserved SPI
   value will not normally be assigned by IANA unless the specification
   is openly available and documented in the RFC publication series.

   Values in the range 256 through 65535 are recommended for manual con-
   figuration.

DRAFT                             ESP2                         July 1997


   Remaining values are utilized by automated Security Association man-
   agement.  These values are recommended to be generated by a crypto-
   graphically random method, to protect against replay attacks and
   traffic analysis.

   This field is mandatory and transparent.  That is, the field is
   always present, and the value is not concealed by encryption.

   Rationale:

      Even when many SPIs are part of the same Security Association,
      there is no numerical relation between SPIs in different direc-
      tions, and no requirement that SPIs be defined in pairs or other
      multiples.

      It should be understood that the same SPI value for different pro-
      tocols will indicate different parameters.  For example, one might
      indicate a cipher algorithm, and another an authenticator algo-
      rithm.

      The requirement for SPI orthogonality between protocols arises
      whenever the values are assigned for multiple protocols in the
      same transaction by automated or manual configuration using a sin-
      gle common value, or the values are assigned independently by an
      outside agent (such as a Key Distribution Center).  Orthogonality
      may also be desirable in future multicast implementations.

      A small range of values for manual configuration is utilized to
      promote ease of configuration and interoperability.  Experience
      has shown that large random numbers are not easily remembered and
      checked by human operators.

      This does not preclude automated configuration from utilizing
      unused values in the reserved and/or recommended manual configura-
      tion ranges during operation.


2.2.  Sequence Number

   The Sequence Number is a 32-bit (4 byte) unsigned counter.  This
   field protects against replay attacks, and may also be used for syn-
   chronization by stream or block-chaining ciphers.

   Manual configuration can only detect replay of consecutive duplicate
   Seqeunce Numbers, and during short runs of Sequence Numbers within
   the round trip time for the parties.  The limited anti-replay secu-
   rity of the sequence of datagrams depends upon the unpredictability
   of the values.  When configured manually, the first value sent SHOULD



Simpson                   expires in six months                 [Page 4]
DRAFT                             ESP2                         July 1997


   be a random number.

   Long term replay prevention requires automated configuration.  When
   configured via an automated Security Association management protocol,
   the first value sent is 1, unless otherwise negotiated.

   Thereafter, the value is monotonically increased for each datagram
   sent.  A replacement SPI SHOULD be established before the value rolls
   over and repeats.

   This field is mandatory and transparent.  That is, the field is
   always present, and the value is not concealed by encryption.

   Although sending this field is mandatory, verification of the
   sequence of values is at the discretion of the receiver.  When
   integrity checking is available, either through the optional Authen-
   ticator field or an external Authentication Header (AH), the imple-
   mentation SHOULD NOT accept duplicate values.  This may be achieved
   by accepting only those datagrams that contain a different value than
   previously received, or by maintaining a small window of acceptable
   values.  See Operational Considerations.

   Rationale:

      To prevent replay of payloads by substitution of a fresh Sequence
      Number, anti-replay must be coupled with authentication and/or
      integrity.

      Less than 2**32 datagrams are sent under any single key when anti-
      replay protection is enforced.


2.3.  Transform Data

   An implementation will use the SPI to determine the Transform Data
   contents and use.  It retains the same general format for all data-
   grams of any given IP Destination and SPI.  The length of this field
   is variable, but is always an integral number of bytes.

   If the transform requires a separate synchronization field, then such
   data SHOULD be carried at the beginning of this field.

   This field is optional and opaque.  That is, the field is not inter-
   pretable without knowledge of the Security Association parameters.
   Refer to each Security Transform specification for more information
   regarding the contents of this field.

2.4.  Padding

   If a cipher algorithm requires the plaintext to be a multiple of some
   number of bytes (such as the block size of a block cipher), the
   Padding field is used to fill the plaintext to the size required by
   the algorithm.  All implementations MUST support generation and con-
   sumption of such padding.

   In addition, padding may be used to conceal the actual length of the
   plaintext.  However, inclusion of such additional padding has adverse
   bandwidth implications and thus its use should be undertaken with
   care.

   Finally, when the Authenticator field is present, padding also may be
   required to ensure that the resulting ciphertext terminates on a
   32-bit (4 byte) boundary.

   Prior to encryption, this field is filled with a series of integer
   values, to align the Pad Length and Payload Type fields at the end of
   the required boundary (measured from the beginning of the Transform
   Data).  By default, Self-Describing-Padding is used [RFC-1790].  Each
   byte of padding contains the index of that byte.  The first pad byte
   contains the value one (1).  The final pad byte indicates the number
   of pad bytes to remove.  For example, three pad bytes would contain
   the values 1, 2, and 3.

   After decryption, this field MAY be examined for a valid series of
   integer values.  Verification of the sequence of values is at the
   discretion of the receiver.

   This field is optional and opaque.  That is, the value (when present)
   is set prior to encryption, and is examined only after decryption.

   Rationale:

      The default padding values were selected for simplicity, ease of
      implementation in hardware, and compatibility with other internet
      security efforts.


2.5.  Pad Length

   The Pad Length (1 byte) indicates the amount of Padding immediately
   preceding it.  The value does not include the Pad Length and Payload
   Type fields.

   The range of valid values is 0 through 255.  A value of zero indi-
   cates that no Padding is present.

   This field is mandatory and opaque.  That is, the value is set prior
   to encryption, and is examined only after decryption.

   Rationale:

      This extra field is appended to Self-Describing-Padding for com-
      patibility with earlier implementations that used random padding
      values.


2.6.  Payload Type

   The Payload Type (1 byte) indicates the contents of the Transform
   Data field, using the IP Next Header (Protocol) value.  Up-to-date
   values of the IP Next Header (Protocol) are specified in the most
   recent "Assigned Numbers" [RFC-1700].

   For example, when encrypting an entire IP datagram (Tunnel-Mode),
   this field will contain the value 4, indicating IP-in-IP encapsula-
   tion.

   This field is mandatory and opaque.  That is, the value is set prior
   to encryption, and is examined only after decryption.


2.7.  Authenticator

   When the ESP data is not otherwise validated (externally using AH or
   internally by the transform algorithm itself), it is recommended (but
   not required) that an Integrity Check Value (ICV) be provided here.
   The ICV is computed over the ESP data after encryption, beginning
   with the SPI and ending with the Payload Type.  A keyed algorithm
   must be employed to compute the ICV.  The length of the field depends
   upon the authenticator transform selected.

   For some authenticator transforms, the bytes over which the computa-
   tion is performed must be a multiple of a block size specified by the
   algorithm, or the block must be "strengthed" by appending a length.
   Implicit padding is appended to the end of the ESP packet, prior to
   Authenticator computation.  The size and form of the padding is spec-
   ified by the transform specification.  This implicit padding is not
   transmitted with the datagram.

   This field is optional and opaque.  That is, the field (when present)
   is not concealed by encryption, but is not interpretable without
   knowledge of the Security Association parameters.

DRAFT                             ESP2                         July 1997


   Rationale:

      The order of processing (authentication "outside" encryption)
      facilitates rapid detection of bogus datagrams by the receiver
      prior to decrypting, potentially reducing the impact of denial of
      service attacks.  It also allows for the possibility of parallel
      processing at the receiver; decryption can take place in parallel
      with authentication, but care must be taken to avoid race condi-
      tions for packet access and reconstruction of the decrypted
      packet.


3.  Processing

   The Security Parameters Index (SPI) is the only coupling between ESP
   and Security Association management mechanisms.  This permits differ-
   ent management mechanisms to be used concurrently.  More importantly,
   it permits any automated management protocol to be changed or cor-
   rected without unduly impacting the security protocol implementa-
   tions.  In order to facilitate early adoption, manual configuration
   is the only mechanism required by this specification.

   The Security Association management mechanism specifies a number of
   parameters for each Security Association between the communicating
   parties.  Manually configurable parameters are summarized in "Opera-
   tional Considerations".

   These Security Association determinations are described in more
   detail in the Security Architecture document [RFC-1825].


3.1.  Outgoing

   ESP is applied to an outgoing datagram only after an implementation
   determines that an existing Security Association calls for ESP pro-
   cessing, based on the IP Destination.  If not, then the Security
   Association management mechanism is used to establish the SPI for
   this communication session prior to the use of ESP.

   The indicated SPI begins the ESP Header.


3.1.1.  Compression

   When configured, perform data compression of the payload.  If expan-
   sion occurs, the outgoing SPI may be changed to a value that indi-
   cates unexpanded data.

DRAFT                             ESP2                         July 1997


3.1.2.  Sequence Number

   Check to ensure that the Sequence Number for this SPI has not over-
   flowed.  If the implementation detects that 2**32 datagrams have
   already been sent, the datagram is discarded, and an auditable event
   is indicated.

   Otherwise, insert the next value into the Sequence Number field.


3.1.3.  Padding

   Append zero or more bytes of padding to the plaintext, as required by
   the transform.

   Append a Pad Length byte containing the number of padding bytes just
   added.

      For example, if the plaintext length is 41, and the block size is
      64-bits (8 bytes), padding is needed to make its modulo 8 length
      equal to 6, leaving 2 bytes for the Pad Length and Payload Type.

      The padding values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and the following Pad Length
      is 5.


3.1.4.  Payload Type

   Append a Payload Type byte containing the IP Next Header (Protocol)
   value which identifies the protocol header that begins the payload.


3.1.5.  Encryption

   Provide an Initialization Variable (IV) of the form indicated by the
   cipher transform specification.

   Encrypt the plaintext, Padding, Pad Length and Payload Type, produc-
   ing a ciphertext in the form indicated by the cipher transform speci-
   fication.


3.1.6.  Authentication

   When configured, calculate and append the optional Authenticator in
   the form indicated by the authenticator transform specification.

3.1.7.  Completion

   Construct an appropriate IP datagram for the target Destination.

   The IP Total/Payload Length is adjusted to reflect the length of the
   encrypted payload, with the SPI, Sequence Number, and optional
   Authenticator.


3.2.  Incoming

   Upon receipt of a (reassembled) incoming datagram containing an ESP
   Header, the implementation determines the appropriate Security Asso-
   ciation, based on the IP Destination and the SPI.  If the SPI is
   invalid, then the datagram is discarded, and the "Bad SPI" error is
   indicated.

   The SPI field is used as an index into the local Security Association
   table to find the negotiated parameters and key(s).


3.2.1.  Sequence Number

   When replay checking is enabled, ensure that the Sequence Number is
   in the appropriate window for this SPI, and that it has not been pre-
   viously received.

   If the Sequence Number appears to be valid, then the implementation
   proceeds to authentication.  The receive window is updated only when
   authentication, decryption and decompression succeed.

   If the Sequence Number is invalid, then the datagram is discarded,
   and the "Authentication Failed" error is indicated.


3.2.2.  Authentication

   When present, remove and verify the optional Authenticator.  If the
   Authenticator is invalid, then the datagram is discarded, and the
   "Authentication Failed" error is indicated.


3.2.3.  Decryption

   If the length of the data to be decrypted is not an integral multiple
   of the transform block size, then the datagram is discarded, and the
   "Decryption Failed" error is indicated.

   Provide an Initialization Variable (IV) of the form indicated by the
   cipher transform specification.

   Decrypt the ciphertext, producing a plaintext, Padding, Pad Length
   and Payload Type, in the form indicated by the cipher transform spec-
   ification.


3.2.4.  Payload Type

   The Payload Type is removed and examined.  If it is unrecognized,
   then the datagram is discarded, and the "Decryption Failed" error is
   indicated.


3.2.5.  Padding

   The Pad Length is removed and examined.  If pad checking is config-
   ured, and the padding bytes are not the correct values for the Pad
   Length, then the datagram is discarded, and the "Decryption Failed"
   error is indicated.

   The specified number of padding bytes are removed from the end of the
   decrypted payload.


3.2.6.  Decompression

   As indicated by the configured SPI, perform decompression of the
   plaintext.  If it is invalid, then the datagram is discarded, and the
   "Decompression Failed" error is indicated.


3.2.7.  Completion

   The IP Total/Payload Length is adjusted to reflect the length of the
   resulting payload, without the SPI, Sequence Number, Padding, Pad
   Length, Payload Type, and optional Authenticator.

   The IP Header(s) and the remaining portion of the payload are passed
   to the protocol processing routine specified by the Payload Type
   field.

3.3.  Error Procedures

   When an error is indicated by this specification, an ICMP error mes-
   sage of that type is transmitted [RFC-xxxx].

   In addition, the implementation SHOULD record the event in a statis-
   tics counter, and SHOULD generate an audit log containing date and
   time, IP Source, IP Destination, IP Flow Label (when present), SPI,
   Sequence Number, and/or the entire contents of the discarded data-
   gram.

   Not all systems that implement ESP will implement auditing.  However,
   if ESP is incorporated into a system that supports auditing, then the
   ESP implementation MUST also support auditing, and MUST allow a sys-
   tem administrator to enable or disable auditing for ESP.

   Additional events not explicitly called out in this specification MAY
   result in audit log entries.


Operational Considerations

   This specification provides only a few manually configurable parame-
   ters:

   SPI
      Manually configured SPIs are limited in range to aid operations.
      Automated SPIs are pseudo-randomly distributed throughout the
      remaining 2**32 values.

      Default: 0 (none).  Range: 256 to 65,535.

   SPI LifeTime (SPILT)
      Manually configured LifeTimes are generally measured in days.
      Automated LifeTimes are specified in seconds.

      Default: 32 days (2,764,800 seconds).  Maximum: 182 days
      (15,724,800 seconds).

   Replay Window
      Some earlier implementations use pseudo-random values in the pre-
      sent Sequence Number field.  This check must only be used with
      those peers that are known to have implemented this feature.

      Default: 0 (checking off).  Range: 32 to 256.

   Pad Values
      New implementations use verifiable values.  Some earlier

      implementations used random values.  This check must only be used
      with those peers that are known to have implemented this feature.

      Also, some operations desire additional padding to inhibit traffic
      analysis.  This feature can be combined with verifiable values to
      provide limited integrity checking.

      The value zero (0) indicates that no checking is done, and the
      range of padding values is defined by the default required for the
      cipher algorithm.

      Default: 0 (checking off).  Range: 3 to 255, defined per cipher.

   Encryption
      Each cipher document will describe the keying material needed.

      Default: DES-CBC with derived IV.

   Compression
      Default: none.

   Authentication
      Each authenticator document will describe the keying material
      needed.

      Default: none.

   Each party configures a list of known SPIs and symmetric secret-keys.

   In addition, each party configures local policy that determines what
   access (if any) is granted to the holder of a particular SPI.  For
   example, a party might allow FTP, but prohibit Telnet.  Such consid-
   erations are outside the scope of this document.

Security Considerations

   This specification is principly concerned with a security mechanism
   for use with IP.  This mechanism is not a panacea, but it does pro-
   vide an important component useful in creating a secure internetwork
   environment.

   Users need to understand that the quality of the security provided by
   this specification depends completely on the strength of whichever
   cryptographic algorithm that has been implemented, the correctness of
   that algorithm's implementation, the security of the key management
   mechanism and its implementation, the strength of the key [CN94], and
   upon the correctness of the implementations in all of the participat-
   ing systems.

   If any of these assumptions do not hold, then little or no real secu-
   rity will be provided to the user.  Implementers are encouraged to
   use high assurance development techniques to develop all of the secu-
   rity relevant parts of their products.

   Note that it is possible, when some cryptographic algorithms are
   employed without an authentication mechanism, for a third party to
   alter the cleartext of a message, even though that party does not
   possess the key.  It is important that applications requiring both
   confidentiality and authentication select transforms that prevents
   this.

   The padding bytes have a predictable value.  They provide a small
   measure of tamper detection on their own block and the previous block
   in CBC mode.  This makes it somewhat harder to perform appending
   attacks in the absence of other integrity protection.  Also, this
   avoids a possible large covert channel (although the amount of
   padding itself could provide a covert channel), and aids in mechani-
   cal certification of the implementation.  This small amount of poten-
   tial known plaintext does not create any problems for modern ciphers.

   This mechanism alone does not provide complete immunity from traffic
   analysis.  Users seeking further protection from traffic analysis
   might consider the use of appropriate link encryption.  These details
   are outside the scope of this specification.

Acknowledgements

   This document benefited greatly from earlier work done by Randall
   Atkinson, Perry Metzger, William Simpson, and Phil Karn, for the SIP,
   SIPP, and IPv6 Working Groups.

   Many of the concepts here are derived from the swIPe security proto-
   col [IBK93a, IBK93b], or were influenced through community diffusion
   of knowledge regarding the US Government's SP3 security protocol
   specification [SDN.301], and the ISO/IEC's NLSP specification
   [ISO-11577].

   Steve Bellovin, Steve Deering, Steve Kent, Dave Mihelcic, and Hilarie
   Orman provided useful critiques of earlier versions of this document.
