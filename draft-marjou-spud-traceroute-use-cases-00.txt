                      Traceroute Use Case for SPUD
               draft-marjou-spud-traceroute-use-cases-00

Abstract

   In the context of the Substrate Protocol for User Datagrams (SPUD),
   this document proposes a new use case and its derived requirements: a
   traceroute function allowing users to explicitly ask middleboxes
   (a.k.a. network devices) to provide their geospatial information.

1.  Introduction

   The IAB is currently working on the evolution of the IP stack
   program, as captured in [I-D.trammell-stackevo-explicit-coop] to de-
   ossify the IP stack.  The Substrate Protocol for User Datagrams
   (SPUD) is a candidate for solving some of the needs identified by
   this work.  A first set of SPUD use-cases has already been identified
   as described in [I-D.trammell-spud-req].

   This document proposes an additional use-case and the derived
   requirements: a traceroute function allowing users to explicitly ask
   middleboxes (a.k.a. network devices) to provide their geospatial
   information.

2.  Terminology

   Middlebox: As defined in [RFC3234], a middlebox is any intermediary
   device performing functions other than the normal, standard functions
   of an IP router on the datagram path between a source host and
   destination host; e.g. making decisions about forwarding behavior
   based on other than addressing information, and/or modifying a packet
   before forwarding.

   Geospatial information: A set of coordinates containing a longitude,
   a latitude and possibly a timestamp which describes the location of
   the middlebox.

3.  Use case

3.1.  Global Traceroute

3.1.1.  User Initiative

   A user wishes to obtain hints about the route taken by its IP flows.
   More precisely, the user wishes to get the geospatial information of
   the middleboxes located on the path between his device and the remote
   server.

3.1.2.  Server Initiative

   A service provider like an online bank service wishes to obtain hints
   about the route taken by the IP flows of their users in order to
   increase the probabilities that the remote device is under control of
   the real user and not under control of a fake user.  The activation
   of the traceroute requires the consent of the user.

3.2.  Traceroute, First Network Device Only

   A user wishes to activate the traceroute function on the first
   encountered middlebox to get an approximate location for his device.

3.3.  Do Not Traceroute

   At any time, the user can require the middleboxes to stop providing
   geospatial information.

4.  Requirements

4.1.  Traceroute

   REQ-1: A server endpoint MAY propose the traceroute activation.  It
   will be up to the user to accept or reject the proposal.

   REQ-2: A SPUD client MUST be able to request one or more middleboxes
   to provide their geospatial information.

   REQ-3: The geospatial information provided by a middlebox MUST be non
   repudiable.

   REQ-4: Providing geospatial information MUST not add significant
   delay to the packets of the flow.

4.2.  Do Not Traceroute

   REQ-5: A SPUD client MUST be able to request the middleboxes not to
   provide geospatial information.

   REQ-6: A middlebox MUST NOT provide geospatial information without an
   explicit consent of the user.

5.  Security Considerations

   When there is a Graphical User Interface (GUI), the user needs an
   explicit notification indicating whether the traceroute mechanism is
   used or not.

6.  IANA Considerations

   None.

7.  Acknowledgements

   To do.
