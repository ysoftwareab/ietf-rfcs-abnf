Internet-Draft        Route Optimization for PMIPv6            July 2007


1.  Introduction

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) base document [I-D.ietf-netlmm-
   proxymip6] specifies a network-based local mobility management
   protocol.  The PMIPv6 base protocol describes a mobility management
   solution without a mobile node's participation in mobility management
   related signaling process.  The PMIPv6 base document considers IPv6
   home address mobility over IPv6 transport network.  The IPv4 support
   document [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support] extends the PMIPv6 base
   protocol in order to support IPv4 home address mobility and IPv4
   transport network.

1.1.  Motivation for route optimization in PMIPv6

   The Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] and Enhanced Route Optimization [RFC4866]
   specify route optimization procedures that allows the mobile node
   (MN) to register its binding information to the corresponding node
   (CN).  After the route optimization procedures, the correspondent
   node can directly send and receive packets from the MN's care-of-
   address.

   In the PMIPv6, packets originated from or sent to a MN are routed
   through bidirectional tunneling between Mobile Access Gateway (MAG)
   and Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) by default, so packets from/to the
   mobile can be delivered through longer path than the optimized route,
   especially when the MN and a CN are in topologically close location
   and LMA is away from the mobile node.  Hence, route optimization is
   useful, when PMIP6 domain spans large area.

   Mobility management signaling is exchanged among network entities in
   PMIPv6.  Further, the MN has home address (HoA) only, so care-of
   address (CoA) test in the MIPv6 route optimization is not directly
   applicable to PMIPv6.  So, this document describes route optimization
   solution based on MIPv6, which simultaneously supports PMIPv6 base
   protocol and IPv4 extension specification.  The document leverages
   route optimization procedures in MIPv6 for PMIPv6 and MAG performs
   MIPv6 route optimization on behalf the MN in the PMIPv6 domain.

1.2.  Route optimization scenarios in PMIPv6

   The followings are typical route optimization scenarios in PMIPv6

    o Scenario 1 :  A MN and a CN are in the same PMIPv6 domain and
      anchored at an LMA.  This scenario covers basic PMIPv6 route
      optimization scenario.

Internet-Draft        Route Optimization for PMIPv6            July 2007


    o Scenario 2 :  A MN and a CN are in the PMIPv6 domain, but they are
      anchored at the different LMAs.  So, inter-LMA operation needs to
      be involved in the route optimization procedures.
    o Scenario 3 :  A MN is in the PMIPv6 domain and initiates route
      optimization procedures with a CN that is outside of the PMIPv6
      domain.  In this case, the CN supports route optimization
      procedures defined in this document.

   Note that as defined in the IPv4 extension document in PMIPv6
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support], the MN and the CN can support
   IPv4 home address mobility in scenario 1 and 2.  Furthermore, the
   network between MAG and LMA can provide IPv4 transport and NAT may
   reside inside the network.  Therefore, route optimization in PMIPv6
   should support IPv4 home address and IPv4 transport network.  This
   document supports route optimization between IPv4 MNs in the PMIPv6
   domain and/or IPv4 transport network.  Route optimization between a
   MN and a CN within a MAG is covered by PMIPv6 base specification
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6].

2.  Protocol Specification

2.1.  Route Optimization with Return Routability Test

   This section describes return routability test with IP node (IPv4 or
   IPv6) whose mobility is provided by PMIPv6.  For simplicity,
   scenarios covered in this section are the case where the MN and the
   CN are anchored at the same LMA and the case where the CN is outside
   of the PMIPv6 domain.  When the mobile node and the correspondent
   node are anchored at different LMAs, inter-LMA query will be used for
   acquiring information about MAG2.  Inter-LMA operation will be
   discussed at the later version of this document.

2.1.1.  IP Node without PMIPv6 Route Optimization Functionality

2.1.1.1.  Return Routability Test in IPv6 Transport Network

   Return routability test described in this document is based on
   Section 5.2 of MIPv6 [RFC3775].  In this section, the headers and
   addresses related to tunneling between MAG and LMA is omitted.  It
   follows PMIPv6 base specification [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6].  We
   also assume that each MAG knows IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of other MAGs
   in the PMIPv6 domain by bootstrapping mechanism or out-of band
   signaling mechod.

   When MAG1 initiates return routability test between IPv6 MN and IPv6
   CN, MAG1 sends HoTI and CoTI messages to MAG2 as defined in MIPv6
   [RFC3775].  However, since MN does not have care-of address in
   PMIPv6, MAG1 sets the source addresses of CoTI as its IPv6 Proxy CoA.
   Other parameters for authenticating the MN will be set same as MIPv6.
   In order to acquire information about which MAG serves the CN, MAG1
   queries it to LMA before initiating return routability procedures.
   Details about query message is TBD.

   Figure 2 and Figure 3 shows HoTI and CoTI message for route
   optimization between IPv4 MN and IPv4 CN.  In case of route
   optimization between IPv4-only MN and CN, they do not have IPv6
   address for inner IPv6 header.  So, the source and destination
   address of inner IPv6 header indicate IPv6 Proxy CoA of MAG1 and
   MAG2, respectively.  Then, the IPv4 addresses of the MN and the CN
   are specified in the outer IPv4 header.  Upon creating HoTI and CoTI
   message, MAG1 tunnels the messages to LMA.  Since deciding which
   tunnel interface to be selected is based on MN's home address, MAG is
   required to forward packets whose destination address is anchored at
   LMA to IPv4 tunnel.

                 /* CN's IPv4 Address */

               Figure 3: CoTI message for IPv4 Home Address

   On receiving HoTI and CoTI message for route optimization with IPv6
   address included, MAG2 processes the received packets according to
   Section 9.4 of MIPv6 [RFC3775].  If the received HoTI and CoTI
   include IPv4 addresses of MN and CN in the mobility option, MAG2
   decapsulates outer IPv4 header and recovers original HoTI and CoTI
   messages.  Then, MAG2 replaces the source and destination address of
   HoTI and CoTI message with IPv4 addresses in mobility option and
   performs return routability procedures in MIPv6 [RFC3775].  After
   completing return routability procedures, MAG1 sends Proxy Biding
   Update to MAG2, as described in Section 2.3.

2.1.1.2.  Return Routability Test in IPv4 Transport Network

   When the transport network is an IPv4 network, route optimization
   procedures need to be performed through IPv4 tunnel between MAGs.
   When MAG1 initiates return routability for IPv6 MN and IPv6 CN,
   similar to IPv6 transport network scenario, MAG1 sets the source
   addresses of HoTI and CoTI as MN's IPv6 HoA and MAG1's IPv6 Proxy
   CoA.  Since MAG1 already has routing state regarding to MN's IPv6
   HoA, HoTI and CoTI message will be delivered to LMA via IPv4 tunnel.
   MAG1 is required to forward CoTI packet to IPv4 tunnel toward LMA by
   looking up the destination address.  LMA will look up routing table
   and forward the HoTI and CoTI message to MAG2.  In case of IPv4

Internet-Draft        Route Optimization for PMIPv6            July 2007


   address support, HoTI and CoTI message have the same format as IPv6
   transport network scenario, as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3.

   On receiving HoTI and CoTI message for route optimization between
   IPv6 MN and IPv6 CN, MAG2 finishes return routability procedures as
   defined in Section 9.4 of MIPv6 [RFC3775] except that HoT and CoT
   will be replied to MAG1 via IPv4 tunnel.  When IPv4 addresses are
   included in mobility option, MAG2 performs the same operation as
   Section 2.1.1.1.

   Note that in case that NAT is present on the path, IPv6 packet
   including IPv6 header and mobility header will be encapsulated by UDP
   header, similar to IPv4 support document [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-
   support].  IPv6 address

2.1.2.  IPv6 Node supporting PMIPv6 Route Optimization Functionality

   In this scenario, route optimization with IPv6 CN is supported only.
   Also, the network between MAG and the CN should be an IPv6 network.
   MAG1 performs same operation as route optimization between IPv6 MN
   and IPv6 CN over IPv6 transport network, as described in Section
   2.1.1.1.  MAG1 exchanges HoT/CoT messages with the CN on behalf of
   the mobile node.

2.2.  Route Optimization - Quick Mode

   Unlike MIPv6, network entities that perform mobility management
   signaling in a PMIPv6 domain are managed entities.  Thus, it may be
   possible to pre-establish security association among MAGs and LMAs by
   bootstrapping mechanism which is not yet defined for PMIPv6.  In this
   section, we assume that security association was established by
   bootstrapping.  Then, MAGs can exchange binding information protected
   by IPsec ESP.  Each MAG may authenticate other MAGs by Peer
   Authentication Database that will be established during bootstrapping
   process.  The Peer Authentication Database will be similar to PMIPv6
   base specification [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6].  Details about
   establishing security association between MAGs are out of scope of
   this document.

   In order to initiate route optimization, MAG1 queries the IP address
   of MAG (i.e., MAG2) that manages the CN to LMA.  Then, MAG1 and MAG2
   exchange bindings.  When the MN and the CN are anchored at different
   LMA, inter-LMA query will be used for acquiring information about
   MAG2.  Inter-LMA operation will be discussed at the later version of
   this document.  Processing bindings is specified in Section 2.3.

2.3.  Bindings Exchange with Correspondent Node

2.3.1.  IPv6 Transport Support

   After completing return routability procedures, MAG1 and MAG2 perform
   proxy binding update/acknowledgement exchange as described in section
   9.5 and 11.7 of MIPv6 [RFC3775].  MAG1 and MAG2 perform the MN
   operation and the CN operation, respectively.  Figure 4 shows Proxy
   Binding Update to the CN (i.e., MAG2).  The Proxy Binding Update
   message includes the MN's IPv6 home network prefix and the CN's IPv6
   address in the mobility option.  When the MN and the CN are IPv4
   nodes, the IPv4 addresses are included in mobility option of Proxy
   Binding Update, as shown in Figure 4.  The Proxy Binding Update
   should be protected by same encryption scheme as defined in MIPv6
   [RFC3775] by default.  Alternately, if bootstrapping mechanism is
   applied to the PMIPv6 domain, MAGs may exchange Proxy Binding Update/
   Acknowledgement protected by IPsec ESP.

           Figure 4: Proxy Binding Update for Route Optimization

   On receiving a Proxy Binding Update message for route optimization,
   MAG2 replies with the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment message including
   IPv6 Route Optimization Acknowledgment or IPv4 Route Optimization
   Acknowledgement.

   After HoT/CoT messages exchange, MAG creates binding cache entry for
   optimized route.  The contents of cache entry include (MN's HoA,
   MAG1's Proxy CoA, CN's HoA, MAG2's Proxy CoA).  Once MN sends a
   packet destined to CN's HoA, MAG1 encapsulates the packet in IPv6
   header.  The source and destination address of outer IPv6 header is
   MAG1's Proxy CoA and MAG2's Proxy CoA, respectively.  Then, MAG1
   tunnels the packet to MAG2.  On receiving the tunneled packet, MAG2
   decapsulates the packet and forwards it to CN.

2.3.2.  IPv4 Transport Support

   When the transport network between two MAGs is an IPv4 network, the
   MAG should perform NAT detection scheme as defined in [I-D.ietf-mip6-
   nemo-v4traversal].  If NAT is present on the path, MAG will exchange
   Proxy Binding Update messages as defined in Section 4.4 of [I-D.ietf-
   netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support].  Figure 6 shows Proxy Binding Update
   message sent from the MAG1 to MAG2.  The source and destination
   address of the outer IPv4 header are the IPv4 Proxy CoAs assigned to
   MAG1 and MAG2, respectively.  The source and destination address in
   the inner IPv6 headers are set to the IPv6 Proxy CoAs of MAGs.  The
   mobility options carry IPv6 or IPv4 address of the MN and the CN.
   UDP header exists in case that NAT traversal is required.  Other
   parameters and processing of Proxy Binding Update follows [I-D.ietf-
   netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support].

3.  Mobile Access Gateway Considerations

   In order to support route optimization in PMIPv6, MAG supports all
   the considerations explained in PMIPv6 base protocol [I-D.ietf-
   netlmm-proxymip6] and IPv4 extension specification [I-D.ietf-netlmm-
   pmip6-ipv4-support].  Also, return routability procedures in MIPv6
   [RFC3775] need to be supported.  In addition to that, followings are
   to be considered.

   o  When MAG initiates route optimization, it should generate
      different home init/care-of init cookies for each MN during return
      routability procedures.

   o  Discovering IP addresses of other MAGs is out of scope of this
      document.

   o  MAG needs to investigate incoming packets to MN/CN whether
      messages for route optimization are encapsulated or not.

   o  If transport network between MAGs is IPv4 and NAT is detected on
      the path, MAG should encapsulate outgoing packets in UDP and
      transmit them to LMA or CN.

   o  When MAG receives a packet destined to a CN whose address is
      anchored at LMA, MAG forwards the packet to LMA through IP tunnel.

4.  Correspondent Node Considerations

   In order to perform route optimization with a MN, a CN should support
   CN cooperation in Section 9 of MIPv6 [RFC3775] and return routability
   procedures described in this document.  In addition to that, the CN
   needs to support following considerations.

   o  After route optimization between a MN (i.e., MAG) and a CN is
      done, MAG transport the MN's packets to the CN via IPv6-in-IPv6
      tunnel.  The source and destination address of outer IPv6 header
      are MAG's IPv6 Proxy CoA and the CN's IPv6 address.  Thus, the CN
      should decapsulate tunneled IPv6 packet and accept the inner
      packet for further processing.


5.  Message Format

   This document introduces several new mobility options.  The format of
   new mobility options will be defined in the later version of this
   document.


6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD


7.  Security Considerations

   This document extends the route optimization scheme in MIPv6 so as to
   apply the scheme in PMIPv6.  So, it does not introduce additional
   security vulnerability other than security considerations related to
   route optimization in MIPv6.  However, since MAG performs mobility
   signaling on behalf of MN, security considerations specified in
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6] are also applied to this document.

   When MAGs exchange binding information without return routability
   procedures, MAGs pre-establish security association by using
   bootstrapping.  So, secure bootstrapping mechanism is required.
   Also, signaling messages should be protected by IPsec ESP.
