1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 protocol as described in [MIPv6] introduces a new mode
   called route optimization (RO), which enables direct communication
   between the MN and the CN.

   However, the RO mode requires a considerable amount of redundant
   signaling messages, which in turn create a significant latency
   problem and raises many security concerns.  These problems are
   seriously undermining the possibility of any wide deployment of the
   RO mode in its current design.

   This document describes an optimization to the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)
   protocol, which uses the crypto-based identifier [CBID] technology to
   securely establish a long lifetime bidirectional SA between the MN
   and the CN and to reduce the IP handoff latency as well as the amount
   of signaling messages.

3.  Problem Statement

   MIPv6 RO mode security is based on the return routability (RR)
   procedure.  The RR allows the CN to check the reachability of the
   MN's home address (HoA) and its new care-of address (CoA), and to
   enable both endpoints to share a secret, (Kbm), in order to
   authenticate the binding update and acknowledgment (BU/BA) messages
   exchanged between them.

   The RR consists on exchanging four signaling messages, i.e., the
   HoTI/HoT and CoTI/CoT, between the MN and the CN, prior to sending a
   BU message to the CN.  However, the CoTI/CoT messages are exchanged
   in clear on the direct path between the MN and the CN, and the HoTI/
   HoT messages are exchanged in clear between the MN's home agent (HA)
   and the CN.  Consequently, such exchange raises many security
   concerns as it is open to many attacks.

   In addition, it is required according to [MIPv6-Sec] to repeat the RR
   procedure during each IP handoff and/or during a maximum of 420
   seconds, even if the MN does not move.  Such requirement boost
   significantly the amount of signaling messages as well as the handoff
   latency and makes the HA a single point of failure.

Internet-Draft                   OMIPv6                    February 2006


   In order to address the RR issues, a new proposal based on using the
   cryptographically generated address [CGA] is under design.  The new
   proposal, i.e., [OMIPv6-CGA], allows the MN to provide the CN with a
   proof of ownership of its HoA's Interface Identifier (IID) and
   enables both endpoints to share a long lifetime shared secret.
   However, the suggested proposal does not allow the MN to provide any
   proof of ownership of its CoA's IID and is open to session hijacking
   and DoS attacks at some critical stage.  It should be noted that
   these attacks don't require the malicious node to be located
   simultaneously on the HA-CN path and on the direct path between the
   two endpoints.  In fact, launching these attacks require the
   malicious node to be located only on the path between the MN's HA and
   the CN (i.e., HA-CN).

   OMIPv6-CGA requires the MN to perform one RR procedure (as defined in
   MIPv6) prior to establishing a long lifetime bidirectional security
   association (SA).  For this purpose, when the MN moves for the first
   time to a foreign network or decide to switch to the RO mode from a
   foreign network, it MUST send a HoTI and CoTI messages to the CN.
   However, the fact that the (HoTI, HoT) pair of messages goes in clear
   between the HA-CN makes them visible to a malicious node located on
   the same path.  Consequently, the malicious node can easily discover
   the home keygen token sent by the CN to the MN in the HoT message.
   In order to launch a successful attack against a MN using the OMIPv6-
   CGA procedure, the malicious node has to send the first BU message to
   the CN on behalf of the MN, i.e., before the MN sends its own BU
   message.  For this purpose, the malicious node has to always keep at
   hand a fresh care-of keygen token.  This can be easily done by using,
   for example its own IPv6 address to exchange at anytime a CoTI/CoT
   messages with the CN, in order to get a new care-of keygen token.

   Sending a first and valid BU message to the CN, on behalf of the MN,
   allows the malicious node to hijack the MN's ongoing session and
   prevents it from establishing a long lifetime bidirectional SA with
   the CN.  OMIPv6-CGA protocol requires that the first BU message
   received by the CN from the MN be authenticated with the Kbm and
   signed with the MN's CGA public key.

   In this memo, we introduce an alternative solution to the CGA
   technology, which offers the same features described in [OMIPv6-CGA]
   and also prevents the attack described above.


4.  Quick Overview of Crypto-based Identifiers (CBID)

   A CBID is a 128-bit opaque identifier, which has a strong
   cryptographic binding with its components, i.e., generated from the
   MN's key pair.  Consequently, using identifiers that satisfy the CBID



Dupont & Haddad          Expires August 21, 2006                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                   OMIPv6                    February 2006


   structure offers the advantage that other nodes, e.g., CNs, can
   safely trust the node when it claims ownership of that identifier.

   A CBID is generated as follows:

   CBID = First(128,SHA1 (imprint | PK))

   where:
   imprint is a 128-bit field, which is a random value.
   PK is the MN's public key formatted as a DER encoding of the
      SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure.
   SHA1 is a one way hash function.
   |  denotes a concatenation.
   First(x,y) means that only the high order x bits are considered from
      the resulting hash value.

   This memo introduces some changes to the procedure used to generate a
   CBID, in order to further reduce the possibility of having a
   collision.  The new suggested method to generate a CBID consists of
   the three following steps:
   1.  Input = 128-bit imprint | Public Key
   2.  Hash = SHA256 (Input)
   3.  CBID = Encode_128 (Hash)
   where Encode_128 is an extraction function, which output is obtained
   by extracting the first most significant 128-bit from the resulting
   hash, i.e., Encode_128 (Hash) = First (128, Hash).


5.  Protocol Description

   The following diagram shows the mobility signaling exchange between
   the MN and the CN for the initial contact:

   1.  MN to CN (via HA): Pre-Binding Update (PBU)
   2a. CN to MN (via HA): Pre-Binding Acknowledgment (PBA)
   2b. CN to MN (directly): Pre-Binding Test (PBT)
   3.  MN to CN (directly): Binding Update (BU)
   4.  CN to MN (directly): Binding Acknowledgment (BA)

   The suggested protocol is described in the following steps:
   -  When the MN moves for the first time to a foreign network, it
      sends a Pre-Binding Update (PBU) message to the CN via its HA,
      i.e., the PBU message is encrypted between the MN and the HA.  The
      PBU message contains the MN's HoA and CoA.  In addition, the 64-
      bit HoA and CoA's IIDs MUST be configured from equally splitting
      the 128-bit crypto-based identifier.  For example, the HoA's IID
      SHOULD be equal to the 64 rightmost significant bits and the CoA's
      IID should be equal to the remaining 64 bits.

Internet-Draft                   OMIPv6                    February 2006


   -  After receiving a PBU message, the CN computes two keygen tokens
      and sends them in two different messages, i.e., the Pre-Binding
      Acknowledgment (PBA) is sent via the MN's HA and MUST carry the
      home keygen token, and the Pre-Binding Test (PBT) is sent on the
      direct path and MUST carry the care-of keygen token.
      In order to prevent a malicious node located on the path between
      the MN's HA and the CN from hijacking the MN's ongoing session, by
      exploiting the discovery of the home keygen token sent in clear in
      the HoT message (as described earlier), this memo suggests that
      the CN MUST compute the two keygen tokens by using the MN's CoA
      and the 128-bit CBID.  For this purpose, the home keygen token
      MUST be computed in the following way:
         Home Keygen Token :=
         First (64, HMAC_SHA1 (Kcn, (CBID | nonce | 0)))
      and the care-of Keygen token MUST be computed in the following
      way:
         Care-of Keygen Token:=
         First (64, HMAC_SHA1 (Kcn, (CoA | nonce | 1)))
      where HMAC_SHA1 is detailed in [HMAC], and Kcn and nonce are
      detailed in [MIPv6].
   -  When the MN gets the PBA and PBT messages, it combines the two
      tokens in the same way as described in [MIPv6], and uses the
      result to authenticate the BU message, which is sent on the direct
      path to the CN.  In addition, the BU message MUST be signed with
      the MN's private key and MUST carry the 128-bit imprint and the
      MN's corresponding public key.  For this purpose, this document
      defines a new option in the BU message to carry the imprint and
      use the same option defined in [OMIPv6-CGA] to carry the public
      key in the BU message.
   -  When the CN gets the BU message, it starts by checking the
      validity of the CBID.  This is done by repeating the three steps
      described above, and comparing the resulting value with the one
      obtained from combining the two IIDs used in configuring the HoA
      and CoA.  If the two values are identical, then the CN re-computes
      the two tokens and checks the authenticity of the the BU message.
      After that, the CN checks the RSA signature.
      If the signature is valid, then the CN creates a Binding Cache
      Entry (BCE) for the MN, computes a shared secret (SK) and encrypts
      it with the MN's public key.  The CN inserts the encrypted SK in
      the BA message and sends it to the MN.  The BA message MUST be
      authenticated with the shared secret.
   -  After checking the authenticity of the BA message, the MN decrypts
      SK with its private key and establishes the bidirectional SA.
      Note that the SA lifetime is by default 24 hours, after which the
      two nodes should re-key by repeating steps described above.
   -  After establishing the SA, all subsequent BU/BA exchange MUST be
      authenticated only with SK until the expiration of the SA.  The RR
      procedure SHOULD NOT be repeated before the SK lifetime expires.

Internet-Draft                   OMIPv6                    February 2006


   -  For any subsequent IP handoff, the MN MAY autoconfigure its CoA by
      using as IID the first 64 bits resulting from hashing SK, the new
      network prefix and the previous CoA (pCoA), i.e.,
         CoA's IID:= First (64, SHA1 (SK | new network prefix | pCoA))


6.  New Messages and Option Formats

   Our proposal introduces 3 new messages and one new option, which are
   described in the following:

6.1.  The Pre-Binding Update Message

   This message is similar to a Binding Update message, but does not yet
   establish any state at the correspondent node.  The purpose of this
   operation is to initiate the sending of two address reachability
   tests.

   This message uses MH Type <To Be Assigned By IANA>.  The format of
   the message is the following:

   Reserved 16-bit field reserved for future use.  This value MUST be
      initialized to zero by the sender, and MUST be ignored by the
      receiver.

   Care-of Address
      The current care-of address of the mobile node.

   Pre-Binding Update Cookie
      64-bit field which contains a random value, a cookie used to
      ensure that the responses match to requests.

   Mobility Options
      Variable-length field of such length that the complete Mobility
      Header is an integer multiple of 8 octets long.  This field
      contains zero or more TLV-encoded mobility options.  The receiver
      MUST ignore and skip any options which it does not understand.
      This specification does not define any options valid for this
      message.

      If no actual options are present in this message, no padding is
      necessary and the Header Length field will be set to 3.

      This message is tunneled through the home agent when the mobile
      node is away from home.  Such tunneling SHOULD employ IPsec ESP in
      tunnel mode between the home agent and the mobile node.  This
      protection is indicated by the IPsec security policy database,
      similarly to the protection provided for Home Test Init messages.

6.2.  The Pre-Binding Acknowledgment (PBA) Message

   This message acknowledges a Pre-Binding Update message.  The purpose
   of this acknowledgment is to provide a part of the key Kbm required
   in the initial phase of our mechanism.

   This message uses MH Type <To Be Assigned By IANA>.  The format of
   the message is the following:

   Care-of Keygen Token
      This 64-bit field contains a Care-of Keygen Token, calculated as
      specified in RFC3775.

   Mobility Options
      Variable-length field of such length that the complete Mobility
      Header is an integer multiple of 8 octets long.  This field
      contains zero or more TLV-encoded mobility options.  The receiver
      MUST ignore and skip any options which it does not understand.

6.4.  The Imprint Option

   This option is carried by the first BU message sent by the MN to the
   CN.  The Imprint option allows the CN to check the ownership of the
   two IPv6 addresses, i.e., HoA and CoA, used in the BU message.

   This option is used in the BU message structure described in [OMIPv6-
   CGA].

   The option format is as follows:



       0                   1                   2                   3

7.  Security Considerations

   This memo describes a solution, which addresses a particular security
   threat related to the presence of a static malicious node on the path
   between the HA and the CN.  As described earlier, such threat can
   easily prevent the mobile node from establishing a long lifetime
   shared secret with the CN, and severely disrupts the other
   alternatives, which are limited to using the classic RO mode as
   defined in [MIPv6].  For this purpose, the suggested solution allows
   the MN to provide the CN with a double proof of ownership of its HoA
   and CoA IIDs and introduces a new way to compute the first home
   keygen token.  Note that this document considers only the case of
   establishing a long lifetime security association.

   The suggested solution offers a simple protection against this
   particular threat, and hence increases the overall security of the
   return routability procedure.

   Finally, the suggested solution does not introduce nor enhance any
   new or existing threats to the return routability.
