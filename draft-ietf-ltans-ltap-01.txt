1.  Introduction

   In all contexts of documents, conservation plays an important role;
   one can often say that appropriate conservation rules are a
   prerequisite for data to be come a document.  Conservation has
   several aspects, e.g. duration or accessibility, that vary based on
   the nature of the document.  For example, a document may be conserved
   for a certain period and may be destroyed after that.  A document may
   be accessible on a public or restricted basis to a set of potentially
   interested or authorized entities.

   The protocol described in this document enables the use of a
   specialized service for conservation of electronic documents.  The
   service creates and delivers enough information to demonstrate the
   existence, integrity and authenticity of electronic data over any
   period of time.  In other words, the service assumes the
   responsibility to retrieve and, optionally, store data for
   conservation, create and store evidence to guarantee data integrity
   and completeness, and to maintain accessibility of data and evidence
   created.

   This document describes a protocol for interacting with a long-term
   archive service (LTA).  The document contains only description of a
   general request and response structure, and a detailed protocol
   description concerning access to an LTA.  Other specifications and
   descriptions, e.g. a framework protocol containing mappings to
   transport and security services, are addressed elsewhere.  The
   protocol is intended to be used in client-server architecture, where
   client is simply an end user (a physical user or another service) and
   the server as an LTA.

   The process of replacing paper based workflow and document handling
   is known as 'dematerialization', ignoring to a certain degree the
   requirements for long term stability of documents.  Document
   conservation is generally performed by specialized services.  For
   electronic formats it is proposed to use similar approaches, while
   maintaining the distance of technical characteristics (paper versus
   electronic).  Conservation might be taken out from other workflow
   activities, while the same procedures (evidence creation) might be
   used for any milestone in electronic document lifecycle (e.g. version
   marking).

   Since conservation of documents created by one entity is only
   necessary if there is a potential entity to which the document may be
   presented at some time, the conservation service (LTA) acts as a
   trusted third party for those two entities.  The main role of an LTA
   is to generate and provide enough information for archived data
   existence in time, integrity and authenticity demonstration over long

   periods of time.  Provision of data storage services is optional and
   may be assured by supportive infrastructure (e.g. database or
   document storage/management system).

2.  Background

   A conservation service or long term archive (LTA) consists of several
   functional blocks.  Some of these blocks are not considered by LTANS
   as they present the basic infrastructure, such as the communication
   network, storage device, data management, etc.  Instead, an LTA
   implements the archive interaction protocol as defined by this
   specification (LTAP) and manages archive objects (logically
   interpreted as packages of archive data and conservation attributes)
   and evidence records [I-D.ietf-ltans-ers].  An LTA is a part of a
   general archive service that provides evidence used to demonstrate
   the existence of an archived data object at a given time and the
   integrity of the archived data object since that time.  The LTA is
   the primary part tasked with creating and delivering conservation
   attributes for archived data.

   [I-D.ietf-ltans-reqs] defines the services that must be provided by
   an LTA.  A pricipal function of the LTA is to generate or obtain
   evidence information for (archive) data submited.  It may accept data
   and generate (or acquire from another service) evidence inforamtion
   or it may simply act as an evidence and demonstration information
   servce without data storage capabilities (it only handles evidence
   and demonstration information).  Evidence generated and maintained by
   an LTA addresses the problems of long-term integrity and temporal
   existence.

   Archive objects are the central logical structures defined by the LTA
   and maintained on a long-term basis.  They are atomic elements of an
   LTA service consisting of three logical elements.  The logical
   structure of an archive object consists of:

   o  Archive data (including meta-data or other related data) entering
      the LTA using the interaction protocol,

   o  Archive process related meta or binding information and

   o  Evidence information

   The archive data may contain any data type, e.g., raw data, signed
   data, encrypted data or time stamped data as defined by [I-D.ietf-
   ltans-reqs].  Archive data may be associated with additional data or
   attributes, e.g. meta information or digital signatures.

   Data generated or collected by the LTA are archive process related
   meta or binding information including demonstration information and
   evidence information.  Archive meta data is needed to provide enough
   information for e.g. special (legal) purposes or validity
   demonstration purposes (e.g. complementary information to digital

Internet-Draft                    LTAP                     February 2006


   signatures).  The LTA collects meta or binding information directly
   from a user or some other entity (e.g.  Certificate Authority).  Such
   information may contain the data owner name, organization, location,
   etc.  Meta or binding information may be submitted by the LTAP
   protocol.

   Demonstration information is collected to demonstrate facts on the
   archive data.  Such information may be digital signature reference
   information.  The LTA may use external resources to collect such
   information usually without user intervention.  Evidence data is
   generated by the LTA or collected from an external resource, e.g. a
   time stamping authority.  Evidence information is provided for all
   data: archive data submitted by a client and archive process related
   data (including binding and demonstration information) collected by
   the LTA from the client or alternative resource.

   The LTA performs perpetual maintenance of generated archive objects
   for the main purpose of demonstrating archive data existence in time
   and providing integrity information for the complete archiving time.
   Archive objects are periodically processed to provide long term
   stability (e.g. by proof-reading, copying to new material, or
   performing time stamp renewal).

   The LTAP protocol interprets the logical data structure to hold all
   needed information (including references) to build an archive object
   including archive data itself (or reference to archive data).  The
   logical structure of the LTAP messages includes archive data,
   archiving process related information and references together with
   request and processing information.  Using LTAP, the LTA should have
   enough information to build and perform operations on an archive
   object(s).

3.  Operation of LTA

   An LTA, as defined by LTANS working group in [I-D.ietf-ltans-reqs],
   is a service that is responsible for preserving evidence data and/or
   data for long periods of time.  The LTA interface enables clients to
   perform the following operations:

   o  submit data to an LTA and request creation of evidence information
      for data - the ARCHIVE service

   o  check the status of submitted data - the STATUS function

   o  transfer or retrieve data (including archive data, meta
      information and evidence information) from an LTA - the EXPORT
      service

   o  delete data and/or evidence information from an LTA - the DELETE
      function

   o  verify the integrity and validity of LTA archived data - the
      VERIFY function

   The primary aim of this protocol is to enable a formal interaction
   between a user and an LTA.  The result of the interaction is a
   verifiable attestation of procedures performed by an LTA (e.g.
   archive data plus evidence record).  The format for data structures
   used to demonstrate integrity, i.e. to demonstrate that data has not
   undergone any transformations while in the care of the archive, is
   partially defined in other documents, namely in [I-D.ietf-ltans-ers].
   This specification does not place any requirements on the structure
   of archived data objects.  However, it operates on elements that are
   derived from archive data objects (e.g. message imprints).

4.  Framework

   This chapter describes a general framework for secure exchange of
   request and response messages between an archive client and archive
   server, e.g. an LTA.  It provides a high level outline and identifies
   common and external aspects from the concrete protocol data units.

4.1.  Functional Overview

   The requirements for LTAP are defined in [I-D.ietf-ltans-reqs].  The
   protocol consists of two layers that are largely distinct but share
   some common features, for example, identificaton and authentication.
   It is assumed that an LTA ensures the long term availability of
   stored data and created evidence information, as necessary, and uses
   appropriate means to manage data and access rights.  These important
   features of an LTA are outside the scope of this specification.

   The common high-level architecture consists of a protocol used to
   exchange requests and responses securely, potentially over different
   types of transport connections, to ensure the long term validity of
   responses.

   Clients and servers use one of several object types to build requests
   and responses.  Data objects include raw (archive) data, request
   information, meta information, identification information and
   attestations.

   Requests and responses are exchanged in a secure way responding to
   different security requirements, which may concern the security of
   the transport as well as the long term validity of the data being
   exchanged.

   The LTA is not a method for implementing something like a secure file
   system.  In general, archived data are rarely accessed, restored or
   transferred.  Thus, the archive operation is the most important one
   and performance is an important concern.

4.2.  Transactions

   The model for the exchange of LTAP requests and responses is borrowed
   from ebXML.  The exchanges for LTAP are conceptually asynchronous.
   An LTAP exchange consists of sending a request and retrieving one of
   two different types of responses.  A client initiates an archive
   service by submiting a request.  This LTAP request consists of data
   to be archived and information related to the archive process.  The
   process information may include client authorization, archive policy,
   service parameters, etc.  The first type of response is a technical
   acknowledgement from the LTA that the request has been received and



Jerman Blazic, et al.    Expires August 5, 2006                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                    LTAP                     February 2006


   the process information has been accepted (or rejected).  The second
   type of response is a statement from an LTA containing an indication
   of the outcome of the requested operation.  This result (called an
   attestation) is, in general, a document with long term validity
   allowing the client to reference the operation, and, in particular,
   to reference the data that has been preserved by the LTA.

   The asynchronous nature of the LTAP protocol is required by LTA
   operations, which may require a specific amount of time to perform,
   e.g. the archive operatyion needs to safely store the data and to
   produce evidence information.

   Not all operations require the use of an asynchronous response.  The
   LTA therefore responds with either the first category or second
   category information, as appropriate.  The first category includes
   response information regarding process information (e.g., receipt of
   the request) while second category adds response information
   regarding operation(s) performed by the LTA.  For some operations, an
   LTA may initally deliver a complete (second category) information
   (e.g.  STATUS request).

   A LTA is assumed to perform an operation with a best effort.
   Nevertheless, it is allowed that an operation can fail or get totally
   lost.  The possibility to deliver the result attestation in a
   asynchronous way is to allow cost effective implementations of the
   LTA.  A client SHOULD be able to recover from lost requests, i.e.,
   avoid deleting data until an attestation has been received.

   Until the receipt of the technical acknowledgement, a client can
   repeat an operation (or use a status request), since the request or
   the response might have been lost.  The client can provide a unique
   identification for the request that SHOULD be used by the LTA to
   ensure idempotence of transactions.

   After receipt of the technical acknowledgement (first category
   information), the client can use a STATUS operation to determine the
   progress of the transaction.  Depending on the lower layer bindings,
   sending a status request (polling) may be the only way to determine
   the outcome of an archive operation.

4.3.  Life cycles of objects

   Using the defined transactions and the operations on object, the life
   cycle is as follows defined.

   There are two levels in the lifecycle.  One is directly derived from
   the operation of a single transaction.  The other is related to the
   long term situation when several operations (MODIFY, DELETE) occur



Jerman Blazic, et al.    Expires August 5, 2006                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                    LTAP                     February 2006


   for the an object.

4.3.1.  Life cycle of one transaction

   T1: Client has not initiated an archive operation.  The TAS does not
   know anything about an object.

   T2; Client has initiated an archive operation.  Client cannot assume
   that TAS has knowledge of the object.  TAS may have received the
   object.  Client may retry the operation after a timeout.

   T3: TAS has received the request and has generated an initial
   response.  On multiple occurences of the request, TAS resends the
   acknowledge.  TAS has initiated the background processing and is able
   to receive STATUS operations.  TAS may still forget about the
   operation.

   T4: Client has received the initial response.  Client should not
   retry the initial operation but rather send STATUS operations. in
   case of negetive response to a STATUS operation, client falls back to
   T1.

   T5: Server has send a definitive answer to a STATUS operation
   assuming the responsible of the initial operation.

   T6: Server has received a definitive answer and can consider the
   operation as terminated.

4.3.2.  Long term life cycle.

   T1: A TAS has archived an object.  A TAS can accept other operations,
   in particular READ operations.

   T2: After a MODIFY operation or a DELETE operation prior to the
   initially defined lifetime of the operation, the TAS keeps an
   information about the actual status of the object (e.g. deletd,
   moved) until the end of the lifetime.  In the case when a transfer
   has occured.  The TAS returns an information of the new TAS usable by
   a client to access to it.

   T3: When the end of a lifetime occurs during executing of a MODIFY
   operation, the object (or its reference) is not delayed until the end
   of the transaction.

   T4: After the lifetime of an object, an object or the reference to it
   is deleted.  When an object is moved to another service to prolong
   its lifetime, the initial reference may be deleted after the end of
   the initial lifetime.

4.4.  Roles, Service Types, Policies and Configurations

   The protocol assumes a number of different actors playing different
   roles.  The basic roles are a client and a server.  These roles are
   simply defined by the types of protocol data units, i.e., requests
   and responses.  Several other roles may exist, which are currently
   not in the scope of the protocol specification.  An example of an
   additional role is a relay or a proxy using both the basic roles of
   client and server.  In general two entities are distinguished, based
   on different characteristics: an entity that requests its data to be
   archived or to be acted upon, and an entity that accepts data and
   assures responsibility of archived data, or acts on the data.  Other
   entities serving as a lower layer transport services, data storage
   services or security services are out of the scope of protocol
   definition.

   Clients may occur in different roles.  Besides users that archive
   data, there may be relying or controlling entities like a judge who
   must be able to get access to it.  Or, there are entities like
   auditors that may access to some data.  The protocol distinguish such
   roles by the definition of the following service types and service
   policy information.

   The LTA interface must therefore enable clients to perform the
   following service types.

   o  submit data to the LTA (and request creation of evidence records
      for data) - the ARCHIVE operation

   o  check status of submitted data to the LTA - the STATUS operation

   o  extract or transfer (archive data and evidence data) from the LTA
      - the EXPORT operation

   o  modify or configure archive process related to data archived by
      the LTA - the MODIFY operation

   o  verify the integrity, authenticity and validity of data archived
      by the LTA - the VERIFY operation

   o  delete data and/or evidence records from the LTA - the DELETE
      operation

   A client implementation MAY only support a subset of the service
   types in order to have a small footprint.  This is motivated from the
   fact that different operations are generally invoked by different
   entities in totally different environments, e.g., a client may only
   submit data and never verify an evidence record.



Jerman Blazic, et al.    Expires August 5, 2006                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                    LTAP                     February 2006


   As mentioned above, depending on the lower layer transport bindings,
   a client may be required to have implemented the STATUS operation in
   order to retrieve the outcome of another operation.

   The way a particular operation is performed is only defined at the
   LTA server side implementation and can be influenced by policy
   information parameters.  A client MAY indicate one or more service
   policy identifiers associated to a service type in order to select
   different features to be performed by the LTA.  The goal of policy
   identifiers is to have client configurations simple.

   An LTA service may provide additional features, which may be
   identified by clients, that govern how services are performed.  An
   LTA might offer a series of features based on quality
   characteristics, e.g. number of timestamps used, refresh period, etc.
   The protocol specification builds on the assumption that features are
   clearly identifiable and are included in the protocol elements.
   Features enable clients to request specific handling by the LTA, such
   as requesting a premium service that assures prompt and immediate
   archiving vs. a standard service that handles queues and generates
   evidence data periodically based on data collections, i.e., one
   timestamp per a document bundle.  Also, services may differ according
   to data storage characteristics (e.g. client may request full
   evidence and storage capacity or only evidence creation service),
   redundancy characteristics (single timestamp versus multiple time
   stamping), etc.  Service characteristics are defined by archive or
   operation policies.

   An LTA may use external services, like validation and evidence
   creation services.  Another service is provision of physical
   infrastructure or data storage and management systems.  Such entities
   can also be referenced by service policy identifiers.

   In general, for each client, in particular those that are archiving,
   a default or single possible configuration is defined at the server
   in order to group features and policies into defined sets.  A server
   may operate different configurations and from the protocol
   standpoint, general configuration is selected by the policy
   identificator.

   As a last mechanism to provide parameters to the archive server, LTA
   clients MAY use specific configuration parameters in their requests.
   The definition of such parameters is not in the scope of this
   protocol.  Configuration parameters allow clients to transfer
   arbitary key/value pairs from the client to the server.

   In principle, a single sequence of policy information is sufficient
   to indicate both the service type and the configuration parameters.

Internet-Draft                    LTAP                     February 2006


   A multi-dimensional approach with configuration and service types
   rounds up the requirements for LTA and scenarios of archiving
   processes.

   Often, an extension of the initial lifetime of an object has to be
   forseen by an LTA service.  To extend the lifetime of an object, an
   EXPORT operation is used to transfer or copy the object to an LTA
   service having the required lifetime policy/configuration.

   This document defines no particular policy or configuration.

4.5.  Entities

   Entities that participate in protocol exchanges are represented by
   identifiers and may possess attributes.  It is outside the scope of
   this definition to define an organisation of identifiers and
   attributes, in particular the way how entity identifiers are related
   to identifiers used for authentication, or what attributes are
   associated to data.

   As the current LTAP specification assumes end-to-end communication
   only, there is no distinction between technical roles like 'client,
   'server', 'relay', 'proxy' or 'authorized agent'.  For LTAP, only
   client and server roles are defined.

   The explicit usage of identifiers and attributes enables decisions to
   be traceable, i.e., the participating entities can indicate to a
   certain degree why they want a service or why it has been provided.

   Furthermore, entity identifiers and attributes MAY be provided by the
   transport or security layer information.  These information can be
   added to protocol elements as trace attributes.

4.5.1.  Entity Identifiers

   Entity identifiers are used in the protocol to indicate the
   participating entities.  A client can indicate one or more
   identifiers indicating who is making the request or participating in
   its creation and one or more identifiers indicating who should
   perform the service.  A server can indidate who has provided the
   service and who is the indented client.

   It MUST be ensured in some way that in an actual context of a client/
   server network names are scalable and global both in terms of actual
   community space and time to live of the treated data objects.

   Identifiers are labeled in some way, i.e. string representations are
   typed and can be derived from various external layers.  Identifiers



Jerman Blazic, et al.    Expires August 5, 2006                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                    LTAP                     February 2006


   SHOULD use an appropriate structure such as ASN.1 definition of
   GeneralName.

4.5.2.  Attributes

   Entities may possess additional attributes like roles, scopes or
   capabilities.  Entities MAY indicate attribute values in protocol
   exchanges so that they can be used for authentication purposes or
   billing.

   Attributes may be related to attributes of data, for example, an
   entity may acts as a judge or arbitrator for a particular
   jurisdiction.  The attribute jurisdiction is associated to the entity
   and to data treated by the service, and thus, can be used for
   authorisation control.

4.6.  Data Model

   The data fields of a LTAP request are as follows:

   o  request information or status information

   o  raw data to archive, or references to data to archive

   o  metadata providing additional information about the data to
      archive

   o  authorisation and authentication information of the entities
      paticipating in the procedure

   o  other information, required for supporting functions like billing

4.6.1.  Data objects

   The data to be archived are arbitrary binary data and, minimally, an
   associated type that must be either available as part of a server
   configuration policy or explicitly indicated by the client.

   Data can be referenced by identifiers.  Data identifiers are used to
   uniquely identify data objects.  Data identifiers SHOULD have an
   additional local structure (e.g., like an EAN with a checksum, in
   order to avoid client copying errors).  An additional measure to
   enhance the redundancy of identifiers is the usage of time values
   which can be used in combination with data identifiers.

   Servers MUST create a server-wide unique identifier for each data
   object managed by the LTA.  The identifier MUST be global during the
   intended lifetime of an object at least.  It is recommended to



Jerman Blazic, et al.    Expires August 5, 2006                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                    LTAP                     February 2006


   include some time based portion in this identifier.

   Clients may provide their own data identifiers in requests.  Whether
   the client provided identifiers are unique is outside the scope of
   the protocol.  LTAs treat these identifiers as opaque information.

   In order to identify data for the short lifespan of a transaction,
   artifacts can be used to reference data or transactions.

4.6.2.  Collection objects

   Data grouping can occur for various reasons, i.e. logical,
   contextual, semantic, operational, etc.  It is out of the scope of
   the LTA to perform grouping for other reasons than operational, e.g.
   reducing costs or improving performance or scalability.  Grouping is
   performed on the level of evidence creation by building hash trees as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ltans-ers].  Grouping characteristics are
   defined by service policies, e.g. per user or on a daily or volume
   basis.  The global parameters for selecting appropriate collection
   strategies are entity and policy identfiers.

   Collections of data can be defined explicitly or implicitly.  A
   document is added to a collection using policy and entity identifiers
   to request a specific collection strategy (e.g. a collection of data
   that is processed on a daily basis for a specific user).  A
   collection identifier may be presented as an extension to an object
   identifier and is intially local to one object.  Adding another
   object to a collection requires the identification of the initial
   object and the identification of one object in the collection.

4.6.3.  MetaData

   Meta information is associated with archive data and can be included
   implicitly, i.e. be a part of a document, or explicitly, i.e. as a
   document attachment.  An LTA does not enable clients to express
   logical relation among documents in the archive nor meta any
   information that is submitted selectively using two ore more
   requests.  For LTAs, the client is only in control of selecting and
   enclosing meta information, which is logically, contextually or for
   any other reason related to a document.

   Meta inforamtion may occur in various forms and may be an intergral
   part of archive data, e.g. security attributes in form of digital
   signatures.  To process such information, the LTA MUST retrieve
   enough information on the type and purpose of information enclosed,
   which may simply be defined with the use of an apropriate archive
   service policy, e.g. archive service for digitally signed documents.




Jerman Blazic, et al.    Expires August 5, 2006                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                    LTAP                     February 2006


   An LTA may perform specific actions related to meta information
   processing (and preservation, such as complementary data collection
   in form of digital certificates).  This can also be done by an
   external service, e.g.  DVCS or SVCP.

   In some scenarios, a specific set of meta information must be
   preserved together with archive data, e.g. information identifying
   the document owner/author, location or time.  The LTAP protocol does
   not define constraints on information type and structure.  The LTAP
   request structure is defined to accept any type of data.

4.6.4.  Binding Information

   Clients and servers MAY include additional information in their
   requests and responses concerning the lower layer binding to a
   transport like SOAP, HTTP or S/MIME, i.e. end-point addresses etc.
   This category may also include things like billing/accounting
   information, i.e. whatever a business transaction needs but which is
   not part of metadata, i.e. outside the scope of the archived data.

   Note: This section needs further discussion.

4.6.5.  Evidence Data

   Evidence information demonstrates the integrity and existence of
   archived data.  The LTA accepts data for the single purpose of
   generating or obtaining evidence information for data submitted by a
   client.  The evidence information structure is defined in [I-D.ietf-
   ltans-ers].

   In case the LTA accepts data only for the purpose of generating
   evidence information (without storage capabilites to avoid, e.g.
   confidentiality issues), the archivation process is limited in time.
   When an LTA performs a renewal of evidence, archived data may be
   required to be available, e.g. when renewing a hash tree.  In such
   scenarios, the LTA requires availability of archived data for hash
   re-computation.  The LTAP protocol does not support function for data
   re-submission.

5.  Data Types

   A number of data types are common to both requests and responses.  We
   give definitions of data as well in XML schema notation as well as in
   ASN.1.  It is intended that an encoding using XML encoding rules of
   the ASN.1 defined data give the same encoding as the XML Schema
   defined type.  We note that the ASN.1 definitions are not
   automatically derived from the XSD definitions (but almost).

   To be discussed: current some data definitions are not equivalent.

   NOTE: Data structures are still not complete!  The following
   desription only outlines the characteristics of the protocol.  ASN.1
   and XML representation needs rework.  To be done in the next version.

5.1.  Artifacts

   Artificats are identifiers used to reference a transaction, or a
   result of a transaction.  They can be returned as a protocol answer
   instead of a response, and allow to retrieve a response or progress
   of a transaction later by the initial client or another authorised
   entity.

   Artifacts are represented by artifacts from SAML.

5.2.  Message Imprint

   A Message Imprint is a short representation of data which can be used
   in evidences to link to some data.  This is just another way of
   saying that they are the result of a one way hash function applied to
   some data.

   We do not assume that a message imprint will always identify some
   data in a unique way (which is not the case by definition of a hash
   function), neither do we assume that collisions may not exist now or
   in the future.  We only assume that within a bounded collection of
   data objects (in time and number), which are stored phyically safe,
   message imprints uniquely designate other data.

   Nevertheless, it is assumed that for the lifetime of protocol
   exchanges, hash functions used to create message imprints are
   crytographically safe.

   The structure of a message imprint is a sequence of an globally
   defined identification of a hash function and an representation of an
   octet string encoding a value of the hash function.

   Message Digests have two components, a description of the hash

5.3.  MetaData

   Metadata are key/value pairs giving addtional information about
   entities or data and are related to preservation process.

   Metadata may be encolsed in any format, e.g. as xml constructs and
   oid/value pairs or as simple data type using a key and a string
   value.  A client MAY select metadata type.

   archive data type (e.g. signed or unsigned).  If type is not
   included, it is assumed that data retrived must be processed as
   binary string (e.g signatures are not verifed and artifacts
   collected).

   Version is used in requests and responses to indicate the protocol
   version used.  This specification is provided for two values:

   o  v0 - This version should be used by implementation that want to

6.  Service Operations

   This section describes in detail the different oerations that a
   client can initiate with a request and their outcomes.  All
   operations

6.1.  ARCHIVE operation

   The major operation of the archive service is the ARCHIVE operation.
   A client prepares the data and associated metadata, adds
   authentication information and transfers the request to the archive
   service.  The archive service acknowledges the receipt of the
   request.  Depending on the service characteristics and binding
   information the service returns two types of responses:

   o  acknowledgement (or rejection) - request is retrieved and accteped
      (or rejceted) for processing

   o  acknowledgement (or rejection) and service result - request is
      retrieved and accteped (or rejceted) and data is archived (or
      rejected)

   When service returns acknowledgement only as an asynchronous
   notification, either the client has to perform a STATUS operation to
   determine the final outcome, or service pools client with service
   result status

6.1.1.  Request

   Client builds request with request information including service
   policy interpreting service characteristics and service configuration
   parameters.  Data to be archived and meta data are enclosed.

6.1.2.  Response

   As a result server responds with acknowledgement including service
   identification and data identification (data reference and/or message
   imprint is included) or service error.  Server may also include
   service result.

6.2.  STATUS operation

   A client can request the status of an operation or a data object.

6.2.1.  Request

   Client builds status request with request information including
   service policy and data identification.  Data identification may

Internet-Draft                    LTAP                     February 2006


   include data itself or data reference or message imprint.

6.2.2.  Response

   Server responds with data status information (e.g. in process or
   archived).

6.3.  MODIFY operation

   This operation allows a client to change the archival status of an
   object.  The new status must be predefined by the server and
   represeented by a policy and configuration.  Examples are the
   transfer to another service provider or to another archival storage
   to extend the lifetime, or to return data to the requestor.  In case
   of a transfer to another server, or when the lifetime is shortened,
   the server remembers the change until the end of the initial
   lifetime, and can redirect a client to the new storage.  This
   operation may also have asynchronous nature (e.g. data shredding
   which may require a timeframe to perform.

6.3.1.  Request

   Client builds modify request with request information including
   service policy, data identification and modify instructions.  Data
   identification must include data itself or data reference or message
   imprint.

6.3.2.  Response

   Server perofrms requested operation and returns service information.

6.4.  VERIFY operation

   This operation allows a client to verify the authenticity of
   information stored in the archive.

6.4.1.  Request

   Client builds verify request with request information including
   service policy and data identification.  Data identification may
   include data itself or data reference or message imprint.

6.4.2.  Response

   Server perofrms requested operation and returns service response.
   The response may include data structures of supporting services
   responses (e.g. signature validation response delivered by DVCS
   service.

6.5.  DELETE operation

   This operation allows a client to delete data or request data
   shredding.  After a successful operation, the the server does not
   maintain any status information about the object.  Note that this
   does not mean that the server does not maintain a trace record of the
   delete operation.

6.5.1.  Request

   Client builds delete request with request information including
   service policy and data identification.  Data identification must
   include data itself or data reference or message imprint.

6.5.2.  Response

   Server perofrms requested operation and returns service response.
   The response must include data represenataion (message imprint at
   least).

6.5.3.  Delete

7.  Presentation and Bindings

   In the previous chapters we have presented all basic data types as
   well as XSD schema as in with ASN.1.  This is done in order to allow
   implentations work on both data syntaxes and to be able to present
   and transform messages in a defined way.

   TBD: Complete data structures.

8.  Security and Transport

   TBD: This chapter needs rework.

   TBD: LTAP requests may include security parameters in meta
   information section.

   TBD: Security may be provided using lower layers, e.g.  XML Security
   for XML syntax based requests/responses.

   The protocol consists of the exchange of data objects encoded as
   different CMS content types, i.e. requests and responses.  These data
   are optionally encapsulated by CMS content types that provide for
   authentication and/or confidentiality, e.g.  SignedData or
   EnvelopedData.

   This document describes the usage of a SignedData construct of
   [RFC3852], where the content type indicated in the eContentType of
   the encapContentInfo is one of the LTAP content types and the
   eContent of the encapContentInfo, carried as an octet string
   containing an encoded request or response structure.

   When using a SignedData structure for authentication, an LTAP request
   and response MAY contain one or more SignerInfo structures, each of
   which may contain countersignature attributes depending on
   operational environments.  When an end user client creates a request,
   there is one SignerInfo.  A relaying LTA MAY add an additional
   signature or a countersignature attribute.

   Clients and relays MUST ensure authenticity of a server when
   submitting data.  In order to do so, they MAY add another
   encapsulation from [RFC3852] that provides for confidentiality,
   and/or MAY use a secure transport layer, e.g., TLS to perform server
   authentication and to ensure confidentiality of the transport.

   Responses are generally protected in similar way by using a
   SignedData encapsulation with one or more SignerInfos, and
   CounterSignatures, depending on the number of participating servers.
   The number of signatures is not related to the number of
   participating servers but rather to the number of entities that may
   be used to authenticate a response or part of it.

   In some circumstances, a client/server communication may be secured
   only by lower layer transport mechanism, e.g.  SSL/TLS.

   A client MUST NOT trust a response that cannot be authenticated.

   Archive clients and servers MUST always create requests and responses



Jerman Blazic, et al.    Expires August 5, 2006                [Page 31]

Internet-Draft                    LTAP                     February 2006


   that can be authenticated with the explicit exception of a global
   error status, which may be returned as a non-signed response.

   There is no mandatory transport mechanism in this document.  All
   mechanisms are optional.  Two examples of transport protocols are
   given that allow online exchange of request and a response, and
   asynchronous communication between a client and an LTA.  A LTA MAY
   use a combination of protocols, for example in order to return
   additional responses.

   Protocol via HTTP or HTTPS: This subsection specifies means for
   conveying ASN.1-encoded messages for the LTAP protocol exchanges via
   the HyperText Transfer Protocol.  The DER encoded LTAP requests and
   responses are encapsulated using a simple MIME object with Content-
   Type application/ltans (and with the default binary encoding).  This
   MIME object can be sent and received using common HTTP or HTTPS
   processing engines over WWW links and provides a simple client-server
   transport for ltans requests and responses.

   A server MUST understand an HTTP 1.1 request together with chunked
   input of a POST request.  A server SHOULD understand a Content-
   Encoding value of gzip.  In case of a HTTP 1.0 request and response,
   a positive value Content-Length indicating the total size of the data
   MUST be used.  A clienst SHOULD send a Host header in the request.  A
   client MUST be able to react to the following status codes: TBC

   Protocol using Email: This section specifies a means for conveying
   ASN.1-encoded messages for the protocol exchanges described via
   Internet mail.  The DER encoded LTAP requests and responses are
   encapsulated using a simple MIME object with Content-Type
   application/ltans with an appropriate Content-Transfer-Encoding.
   This MIME object can be sent and received using MIME processing
   engines and provides a simple Internet mail transport for LTAP
   responses.

   In order to be able to associate a possible error response with a
   request, the requester SHOULD use the field 'transactionIdentifier'.
   The requester SHOULD not make any assumption about the usage of
   message header fields by the responding service, in particular the
   usage of fields like Subject, Message-ID or References.

9.  Security Considerations

   This section discusses addition security considerations of the
   framework.

   When designing an LTA service, the following considerations have been
   identified that have an impact upon the validity or "trust" in the
   ltans server responses.

   The protocol assumes that data is preserved via periodic execution of
   operations, i.e. timestamp refresh, intended to ensure data with
   demonstrable integrity is available throughout the lifetime of an
   archived data object.  The rate of refresh will be driven by a number
   of factors, some of which have a direct impact of demonstration of
   integrity.  For example, the confidence in the strength of
   cryptographic algorithms is a factor in determining when a refresh
   operation should be performed.

   Depending on the lifetime and the quality of data, relying on
   cryptographic protection of data object may not be a sufficient means
   to determine authenticity in time may be required, e.g. physical
   protection of dated staorage material.

   It is imperative that keys used to sign responses are guarded with
   proper security and controls in order to minimize the possibility of
   compromise.  Nevertheless, in case the private key does become
   compromised, an audit trail of all the response generated by the
   service SHOULD be kept as a means to help discriminate between
   genuine and false responses.  A LTA MAY provide for a service to
   validate responses created by this service or another one solely
   based on the audit trail.

   As already indicated, when confidentiality and server authentication
   is required, requests and responses MAY be protected using
   appropriate mechanisms (e.g., CMS encapsulation [RFC 2630] or TLS
   [RFC2246]).

   Server authentication is highly recommended for all service which
   transfer data to a server.

   Client identification and authentication MAY use services defined by
   TLS [RFC2246]) instead of, or in addition to, using a document or
   message protection format, e.g.  CMS.
