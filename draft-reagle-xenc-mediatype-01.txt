Internet-Draft           XML Encryption Media-Type              June 2002 



2. Introduction

   As excerpted from [XENC] (section 8.1):

     "XML Encryption Syntax and Processing [XML-Encryption] specifies a
     process for encrypting data and representing the result in XML. The
     data may be arbitrary data (including an XML document), an XML
     element, or XML element content. The result of encrypting data is
     an XML Encryption element which contains or references the cipher
     data.

     The application/xenc+xml media type allows XML Encryption
     applications to identify encrypted documents. Additionally it
     allows applications cognizant of this media-type (even if they are
     not XML Encryption implementations) to note that the media type of
     the decrypted (original) object might be a type other than XML."

   Please see the XML Encryption Media Type specified in [XENC].
