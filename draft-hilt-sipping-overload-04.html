<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when
    SIP servers have insufficient resources to handle all SIP messages
    they receive. Even though the SIP protocol provides a limited
    overload control mechanism through its 503 (Service Unavailable)
    response code, SIP servers are still vulnerable to overload. This
    document proposes new overload control mechanisms for SIP.

Introduction</h3>

<p>As with any network element, a Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> server can suffer from overload
    when the number of SIP messages it receives exceeds the number of
    messages it can process. Overload can pose a serious problem for a
    network of SIP servers. During periods of overload, the throughput
    of a network of SIP servers can be significantly degraded. In
    fact, overload may lead to a situation in which the throughput
    drops down to a small fraction of the original processing
    capacity. This is often called congestion collapse.
</p>
<p>Overload is said to occur if a SIP server does not have
    sufficient resources to process all incoming SIP messages. These
    resources may include CPU processing capacity, memory,
    network bandwidth, input/output, or disk resources.
</p>
<p>For overload control, we only consider failure cases where SIP
    servers are unable to process all SIP requests. There are other
    cases where a SIP server can successfully process incoming
    requests but has to reject them due to other failure
    conditions. For example, a PSTN gateway that runs out of trunk
    lines but still has plenty of capacity to process SIP messages
    should reject incoming INVITEs using a 488 (Not Acceptable Here)
    response <a class='info' href='#RFC4412'>[RFC4412]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H. and J. Polk, &ldquo;Communications Resource Priority for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. Similarly, a SIP registrar
    that has lost connectivity to its registration database but is
    still capable of processing SIP messages should reject REGISTER
    requests with a 500 (Server Error) response <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>. Overload control does not apply to these cases and SIP
    provides appropriate response codes for them.
</p>
<p>The SIP protocol provides a limited mechanism for overload
    control through its 503 (Service Unavailable) response
    code. However, this mechanism cannot prevent overload of a SIP
    server and it cannot prevent congestion collapse. In fact, the use
    of the 503 (Service Unavailable) response code may cause traffic
    to oscillate and to shift between SIP servers and thereby worsen
    an overload condition. A detailed discussion of the SIP overload
    problem, the problems with the 503 (Service Unavailable) response
    code and the requirements for a SIP overload control mechanism can
    be found in <a class='info' href='#I-D.rosenberg-sipping-overload-reqs'>[I&#8209;D.rosenberg&#8209;sipping&#8209;overload&#8209;reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Requirements for Management of Overload in the Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Design Considerations</h3>

<p>This section discusses key design considerations for a SIP
    overload control mechanism. The goal for this mechanism is to
    enable a SIP server to control the amount of traffic it receives
    from its upstream neighbors.

System Model</h3>

<p>The model shown in <a class='info' href='#fig:archa'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>System Model for Overload Control</span><span>)</span></a> identifies
    fundamental components of an SIP overload control system:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>SIP Processor:</dt>
<dd>The SIP Processor processes SIP
      messages and is the component that is protected by overload
      control.
</dd>
<dt>Monitor:</dt>
<dd>The Monitor measures the current load of
      the SIP processor on the receiving entity. It implements the
      mechanisms needed to determine the current usage of resources
      relevant for the SIP processor and reports load samples (S) to
      the Control Function.
</dd>
<dt>Control Function:</dt>
<dd>The Control Function implements
      the overload control algorithm. The control function uses the
      load samples (S) and determines if overload has occurred and a
      throttle (T) needs to be set to adjust the load sent to the SIP
      processor on the receiving entity. The control function on the
      receiving entity sends load feedback (F) to the sending
      entity.
</dd>
<dt>Actuator:</dt>
<dd>The Actuator implements the algorithms
      needed to act on the throttles (T) and to adjust the amount of
      traffic forwarded to the receiving entity. For example, a
      throttle may instruct the Actuator to reduce the traffic
      destined to the receiving entity by 10%. The algorithms in the
      Actuator then determine how the traffic reduction is achieved,
      e.g., by selecting the messages that will be affected and
      determining whether they are rejected or redirected.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>The type of feedback (F) conveyed from the receiving to the

Degree of Cooperation</h3>

<p>A SIP request is often processed by more than one SIP
    server on its path to the destination. Thus, a design choice for
    overload control is where to place the components of overload
    control along the path of a request and, in particular, where to place the
    Monitor and Actuator. This design choice determines the degree of
    cooperation between the SIP servers on the path. Overload control
    can be implemented locally on a SIP server if Monitor and Actuator
    reside on the same server. Overload control can be implemented
    hop-by-hop with the Monitor on one server and the Actuator on its 
    direct upstream neighbor. Finally, overload control can be
    implemented end-to-end with Monitors on all SIP servers along the
    path of a request and one Actuator on the sender. In this case,
    Monitors have to cooperate to jointly determine the current
    resource usage on this path. These three configurations are shown
    in <a class='info' href='#fig:hbh-e2e'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Degree of Cooperation between Servers</span><span>)</span></a>.

Local Overload Control</h3>

<p>Servers can implement SIP overload control locally. This does
      not require any cooperation with neighboring SIP servers. All
      overload control components (Monitor, Control Function,
      Actuator) reside on the same SIP element. The idea of local
      overload control is to determine when a SIP server reaches a 
      high load and to start rejecting requests with as little effort
      as possible, i.e., early in the processing, if overload
      occurs. Since rejecting these messages requires less processing
      capacity than fully processing them, a server is able to
      gracefully reject excess messages instead of simply dropping
      them. However, once the number of incoming requests exceeds the
      server's capacity to reject them, the server will still become
      overloaded.
</p>
<p>Local overload control does not require protocol support and
      is out of scope for this document.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.2"></a><h3>3.2.2.&nbsp;
Hop-by-Hop</h3>

<p>The idea of hop-by-hop overload control is to instantiate a
      separate control loop between all neighboring SIP servers that
      directly exchange traffic. I.e., the Actuator is located on the
      SIP server that is the direct upstream neighbor of the SIP
      server that has the corresponding Monitor. Each control loop
      between two servers is completely independent of the control
      loop with other servers further up- or downstream. In the
      example in <a class='info' href='#fig:hbh-e2e'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Degree of Cooperation between Servers</span><span>)</span></a>(b), three independent
      overload control loops are instantiated: A - B, B - C and B -
      D. Each loop only controls a single hop. Overload feedback
      received from a downstream neighbor is not forwarded further
      upstream. Instead, a SIP server acts on this feedback, for 
      example, by re-routing or rejecting traffic if needed. If the
      upstream neighbor of a server also becomes overloaded, it will
      report this problem to its upstream neighbors, which again take
      action based on the reported feedback. Thus, in hop-by-hop
      overload control, overload is always resolved by the direct
      upstream neighbors of the overloaded server without the need to
      involve entities that are located multiple SIP hops away.
</p>
<p>Hop-by-hop overload control reduces the impact of overload on
      a SIP network and, in particular, can avoid congestion
      collapse. In addition, hop-by-hop overload control is simple and
      scales well to networks with many SIP entities. It does not
      require a SIP entity to aggregate a large number of overload
      status values or keep track of the overload status of SIP
      servers it is not communicating with.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.3"></a><h3>3.2.3.&nbsp;
End-to-End</h3>

<p>End-to-end overload control implements an overload control
      loop along the entire path of a SIP request, from UAC to UAS. An 
      end-to-end overload control mechanism consolidates overload
      information from all SIP servers on the way including all 
      proxies and the UAS and uses this information to throttle
      traffic as far upstream as possible. An end-to-end overload
      control mechanism has to be able to frequently collect the
      overload status of all servers on the potential path(s) to a
      destination and combine this data into meaningful overload
      feedback.
</p>
<p>A UA or SIP server only needs to throttle requests if it
      knows that these requests will eventually be forwarded to an
      overloaded server. For example, if D is overloaded in <a class='info' href='#fig:hbh-e2e'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Degree of Cooperation between Servers</span><span>)</span></a>(c), A should only throttle requests it
      forwards to B when it knows that they will be forwarded to D. It
      should not throttle requests that will eventually be forwarded
      to C, since server C is not overloaded. In many cases, it is
      difficult for A to determine which requests will be routed to C
      and D since this depends on the local routing decision made by
      B.
</p>
<p>The main problem of end-to-end path overload control is its
      inherent complexity since UAC or SIP servers need to monitor
      all potential paths to a destination in order to determine which
      requests should be throttled and which requests may be sent. In
      addition, the routing decisions of a SIP server depend on local
      policy, which can be difficult to infer for an upstream
      neighbor. Therefore, end-to-end overload control is likely to
      only work well in simple, well-known topologies (e.g., a server
      that is known to only have one downstream neighbor) or if a
      UA/server sends many requests to the exact same destination.

<a name="rfc.section.3.3"></a><h3>3.3.&nbsp;
Topologies</h3>

<p>The following topologies describe four generic SIP server 
    configurations, which each poses specific challenges for an
    overload control mechanism.
</p>
<p>In the "load balancer" configuration shown in <a class='info' href='#fig:multiple'>Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Topologies</span><span>)</span></a>(a) a set of SIP servers (D, E and F)
    receives traffic from a single source A. A load balancer is a
    typical example for such a configuration. In this configuration,
    overload control needs to prevent server A (i.e., the load
    balancer) from sending too much traffic to any of its downstream
    neighbors D, E and F. If one of the downstream neighbors becomes
    overloaded, A can direct traffic to the servers that still have
    capacity. If one of the servers serves as a backup, it can be
    activated once one of the primary servers reaches overload.
</p>
<p>If A can reliably determine that D, E and F are its only
    downstream neighbors and all of them are in overload, it may
    choose to report overload upstream on behalf of D, E and
    F. However, if the set of downstream neighbors is not fixed or
    only some of them are in overload then A should not use overload 
    control since A can still forward the requests destined to
    non-overloaded downstream neighbors. These requests would be
    throttled as well if A would use overload control towards its
    upstream neighbors.
</p>
<p>In the "multiple sources" configuration shown in <a class='info' href='#fig:multiple'>Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Topologies</span><span>)</span></a>(b), a SIP server D receives traffic from  
    multiple upstream sources A, B and C. Each of these sources can
    contribute a different amount of traffic, which can vary over
    time. The set of active upstream neighbors of D can change as
    servers may become inactive and previously inactive servers may
    start contributing traffic to D.
</p>
<p>If D becomes overloaded, it needs to generate feedback to
    reduce the amount of traffic it receives from its upstream
    neighbors. D needs to decide by how much each upstream neighbor
    should reduce traffic. This decision can require the consideration
    of the amount of traffic sent by each upstream neighbor and it may
    need to be re-adjusted as the traffic contributed by each upstream
    neighbor varies over time. 
</p>
<p>An important goal for overload control is to achieve fairness
    across upstream neighbors. I.e., no upstream neighbor should be
    required to throttle more than another neighbor. In a fair system,
    each request that is routed to D has an equal chance of being
    processed, independent of the upstream neighbor it is coming
    from. A SIP server may have local policies that prefers some
    sources over others. For example, it can throttle a less preferred
    upstream neighbor more or earlier than a preferred neighbor.
</p>
<p>In many configurations, SIP servers form a "mesh" as shown in <a class='info' href='#fig:multiple'>Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Topologies</span><span>)</span></a>(c). Here, multiple upstream servers A, B
    and C forward traffic to multiple alternative servers D and
    E. This configuration is a combination of the "load balancer" and
    "multiple sources" scenario.

<p>Overload control that is based on reducing the number of
    messages a sender is allowed to send is not suited for servers
    that receive requests from a very large population of senders, each of
    which only infrequently sends a request. This scenario is shown in 
    <a class='info' href='#fig:multiple'>Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Topologies</span><span>)</span></a>(d). An edge proxy that is connected
    to many UAs is a typical example for such a configuration.
</p>
<p>Since each UA typically only contributes a few requests, which
    are often related to the same call, it can't decrease its message
    rate to resolve the overload. In such a configuration, a SIP
    server can resort to local overload control by rejecting a
    percentage of the requests it receives with 503 (Service Unavailable)
    responses. Since there are many upstream neighbors that contribute  
    to the overall load, sending 503 (Service Unavailable) to a
    fraction of them can gradually reduce load without entirely
    stopping all incoming traffic. Using 503 (Service Unavailable)
    towards individual sources can, however, not prevent overload if a
    large number of users places calls at the same time.

Overload Control Method</h3>

<p>The method used by an overload control mechanism to limit the
    amount of traffic forwarded to an element is an important aspect
    of the design. We discuss the following three different types of
    overload control: rate-based, loss-based and window-based overload
    control.

<a name="rfc.section.3.4.1"></a><h3>3.4.1.&nbsp;
Rate-based Overload Control</h3>

<p>The key idea of rate-based overload control is to limit the
      request rate at which an upstream element is allowed to forward
      to the downstream neighbor. If overload occurs, a SIP server
      instructs each upstream neighbor to send at most X requests per 
      second. Each upstream neighbor can be assigned a different rate
      cap. 
</p>
<p>The rate cap ensures that the number of requests received by 
      a SIP server never increases beyond the sum of all rate caps
      granted to upstream neighbors. It can protect a SIP server
      against overload even during load spikes if no new upstream
      neighbors start sending traffic. New upstream neighbors need to
      be factored into the rate caps assigned as soon as they
      appear. The current overall rate cap used by a SIP server is 
      determined by an overload control algorithm, e.g., based on
      system load.
</p>
<p>An algorithm for the sending entity to implement a rate cap
      of a given number of requests per second X is request 
      gapping. After transmitting a request to a downstream neighbor,
      a server waits for 1/X seconds before it transmits the next
      request to the same neighbor. Requests that arrive during the
      waiting period are not forwarded and are either redirected, 
      rejected or buffered.
</p>
<p>The main drawback of this mechanism is that it requires a SIP
      server to assign a certain rate cap to each of its upstream
      neighbors based on its overall capacity. Effectively, a server
      assigns a share of its capacity to each upstream neighbor. The
      server needs to ensure that the sum of all rate caps assigned to
      upstream neighbors is not (significantly) higher than its actual
      processing capacity. This requires a SIP server to continuously
      evaluate the amount of load it receives from each upstream
      neighbor and assign a rate cap that is suitable for this
      neighbor without limiting it too much. For example, in a
      non-overloaded situation, it could assign a rate cap that is 10%
      higher than the current number of requests received from this
      neighbor. This rate cap needs to be adjusted if the number of
      requests generated by the upstream neighbor changes (e.g., the
      server wants to contribute a higher amount of traffic). The cap
      also needs to be adjusted if a new upstream neighbors appears or
      an existing neighbor stops transmitting. If the cap assigned to
      an upstream neighbor is too high, the server may still
      experience overload. However, if the cap is too low, the
      upstream neighbors will reject requests even though they could
      be processed by the server.

<a name="rfc.section.3.4.2"></a><h3>3.4.2.&nbsp;
Loss-based Overload Control</h3>

<p>A loss percentage enables a SIP server to ask an upstream
      neighbor to reduce the number of requests it would normally
      forward to this server by a percentage X. For example, a SIP
      server can ask an upstream neighbor to reduce the number of
      requests this neighbor would normally send by 10%. The upstream
      neighbor then redirects or rejects X percent of the traffic that
      is destined for this server. The loss percentage is determined
      by an overload control algorithm, e.g., based on current system
      load.
</p>
<p>An algorithm for the sending entity to implement a loss
      percentage is to draw a random number between 1 and 100 for each
      request to be forwarded. The request is not forwarded to the
      server if the random number is less than or equal to X. 
</p>
<p>An advantage of loss-based overload control is that, the
      receiving entity does not need to track the request rate it
      receives from each upstream neighbor. It is sufficient to
      monitor the overall system utilization. To reduce load, a server
      can ask its upstream neighbors to lower the traffic forwarded by
      a certain percentage. The server calculates this percentage by
      combining the loss percentage that is currently in use (i.e.,
      the loss percentage the upstream neighbors are currently using
      when forwarding traffic), the current system utilization and the
      desired system utilization. For example, if the server load
      approaches 90% and the current loss percentage is set to a 50%
      traffic reduction, then the server can decide to increase the loss
      percentage to 55% in order to get to a system utilization of 
      80%. Similarly, the server can lower the loss percentage if
      permitted by the system utilization. This requires that system
      utilization can be accurately measured and that these
      measurements are reasonably stable. Loss-based overload control
      achieves fairness among incoming requests if all upstream
      neighbors are throttled by the same percentage. In this case,
      each request destined for an overloaded server has the same
      chance of being rejected by overload control.
</p>
<p>The main drawback of percentage throttling is that the
      throttle percentage needs to be adjusted to the current number
      of requests received by the server. This is in particular
      important if the number of requests received fluctuates
      quickly. For example, if a SIP server sets a throttle value of
      10% at time t1 and the number of requests increases by 20%
      between time t1 and t2 (t1&lt;t2), then the server will see an
      increase in traffic by 10% between time t1 and t2. This is even
      though all upstream neighbors have reduced traffic by 10% as
      told. Thus, percentage throttling requires an adjustment of the
      throttling percentage in response to the traffic received and
      may not always be able to prevent a server from encountering
      brief periods of overload in extreme cases.

Window-based Overload Control</h3>

<p>The key idea of window-based overload control is to allow an
      entity to transmit a certain number of messages before it needs
      to receive a confirmation for the messages in transit. Each
      sender maintains an overload window that limits the number of
      messages that can be in transit without being confirmed.
</p>
<p>Each sender maintains an unconfirmed message counter for each
      downstream neighbor it is communicating with. For each message
      sent to the downstream neighbor, the counter is increased by
      one. For each confirmation received, the counter is decreased by
      one. The sender stops transmitting messages to the downstream
      neighbor when the unconfirmed message counter has reached the
      current window size.
</p>
<p>A crucial parameter for the performance of window-based
      overload control is the window size. The windows size together
      with the round-trip time between sender and receiver determines
      the effective message rate that can be achieved. Each sender has
      an initial window size it uses when first sending a
      request. This window size can be changed based on the feedback
      it receives from the receiver. The receiver can require a
      decrease in window size to throttle the sender or allow an
      increase to allow an increasing message rate. 
</p>
<p>The sender adjusts its window size as soon as it receives the
      corresponding feedback from the receiver. If the new window size
      is smaller than the current unconfirmed message counter, the
      sender stops transmitting messages until more messages are
      confirmed and the current unconfirmed message counter is less
      than the window size.
</p>
<p>A sender should not treat the reception of a 100 Trying
      response as an implicit confirmation for a message. 100 Trying
      responses are often created by a SIP server very early in 
      processing and do not indicate that a message has been successfully
      processed and cleared from the input buffer. If the downstream
      neighbor is a stateless proxy, it will not create 100 Trying
      responses at all and instead pass through 100 Trying responses
      created by the next stateful server. Also, 100 Trying responses
      are typically only created for INVITE requests. Explicit message
      confirmations via an overload feedback mechanism do not have
      these problems.
</p>
<p>The behavior and issues of window-based overload control are
      similar to rate-based overload control, in that the total
      available receiver buffer space needs to be divided among all
      upstream neighbors. However, unlike rate-based overload control,
      window-based overload control can ensure that the receiver
      buffer does not overflow under normal conditions. The
      transmission of messages by senders is effectively clocked by
      message confirmations received from the receiver. A buffer
      overflow can occur if a large number of new upstream neighbors
      arrives at the same time.

Overload Control Algorithms</h3>

<p>An important aspect of the design of overload control mechanism
    is the overload control algorithm. The control algorithm
    determines when the amount of traffic a SIP server receives needs
    to be decreased and when it can be increased.
</p>
<p>Overload control algorithms have been studied to a large extent
    and many different overload control algorithms exist. This

Self-Limiting</h3>

<p>An important design aspect for an overload control mechanism
    is that it is self limiting. I.e., an overload control mechanism
    should stop a sender if the sender does not receive any feedback
    from the receiver. This avoids that an overloaded server, which
    has become unable to generate overload control feedback, will be
    overwhelmed with requests.
</p>
<p>Window-based overload control is inherently self-limiting since
    a sender cannot continue without receiving confirmations. Servers
    using Rate- or Loss-based overload control need to be configured
    to stop transmitting if they do not receive any feedback from the
    receiver.

SIP Response Header</h3>

<p>Overload control information can be transmitted using a new
      Via header field parameter for overload control. A SIP server
      can add this header parameter to the responses it is
      sending upstream to inform its upstream neighbors about the
      current overload status. A detailed description of this header
      is provided in <a class='info' href='#sec:header'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Via Header Parameters for Overload Control</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>This approach has the following characteristics:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A Via header parameter is light-weight and creates very
        little overhead. It does not require the transmission of
        additional messages for overload control and does not increase
        traffic or processing burdens in an overload situation. 
</li>
<li>Overload control status can frequently be reported to
        upstream neighbors since it is a part of a SIP response. This
        enables the use of this mechanism if overload feedback is
        needed frequently, e.g., for loss- or window-based overload
        control.
</li>
<li>With a Via header parameter, overload control status is inherent
	in SIP signaling and is automatically conveyed to all relevant
	upstream neighbors, i.e., neighbors that are currently
	contributing traffic. There is no need for a SIP server to
	specifically track the set of current upstream or downstream
	neighbors with which it should exchange overload feedback.
</li>
<li>Overload status is not conveyed to inactive senders. This
        avoids the transmission of overload feedback to inactive
        senders, which do not contribute traffic. If an inactive
        sender starts to transmit while the receiver is in overload it
        will receive overload feedback in the first response and can
        adjust the amount of traffic forwarded accordingly. 
</li>
<li>A SIP server can limit the distribution of overload control
	information by only inserting it into responses to known
	upstream neighbors. A SIP server can use transport level

SIP Event Package</h3>

<p>Overload control information can also be conveyed from a
      receiver to a sender using a new event package. This event
      package enables a sending entity to subscribe to the overload
      status of its downstream neighbors and receive notifications of
      overload control status changes in NOTIFY requests. A detailed
      description of this event package is provided in <a class='info' href='#sec:event'>Section&nbsp;6<span> (</span><span class='info'>'Overload-Control' Event Package</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>This approach has the following characteristics:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Overload control information is conveyed outside of the SIP
        signaling flow and can be decoupled from SIP signaling. For
        example, a separate overload control manager can be
        responsible for monitoring the load on all servers in a server
        farm and provide overload control feedback to all SIP servers
        that have set up subscriptions to this controller.
</li>
<li>With an event package, a receiver can send updates to
        senders that are currently inactive. Inactive senders will
        receive a notification about the overload and can refrain from
        sending traffic to this neighbor until the overload condition
        is resolved. The receiver can also notify all potential
        senders once they are permitted to send traffic
        again. However, these notifications do generate additional
        traffic, which adds to the overall load.
</li>
<li>A SIP entity needs to set up and maintain overload control
        subscriptions with all upstream and downstream neighbors. A
        new subscription needs to be set up before/while a request is
        transmitted to a new downstream neighbor. Servers can be
        configured to subscribe at boot time. However, this would
        require additional protection to avoid the avalanche restart 
        problem for overload control. Subscriptions need to be
        terminated when they are not needed any more, which can be
        done, for example, using a timeout mechanism. 
</li>
<li>A receiver needs to send NOTIFY messages to all subscribed
	upstream neighbors in a timely manner when the control algorithm
	requires a change in the control variable (e.g., when a SIP
	server is in an overload condition). This includes active as
	well as inactive neighbors. Depending on the number of
	neighbors, these NOTIFYs add to the amount of traffic that 
	needs to be processed. To ensure that these requests will not
	be dropped due to overload, a priority mechanism needs to be
	implemented in all servers these request will pass
	through.
</li>
<li>A SIP server can limit the set of senders that can receive
        overload control information by authenticating subscriptions
        to this event package.

Backwards Compatibility</h3>

<p>An new overload control mechanism needs to be backwards
    compatible so that it can be gradually introduced into a network
    and functions properly if only a fraction of the servers support
    it.
</p>
<p>Hop-by-hop overload control does not require that all SIP
    entities in a network support it. It can be used effectively
    between two adjacent SIP servers if both servers support overload
    control and does not depend on the support from any other server
    or user agent. The more SIP servers in a network support
    hop-by-hop overload control, the better protected the network is
    against occurrences of overload.
</p>
<p>In topologies such as the ones depicted in <a class='info' href='#fig:multiple'>Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Topologies</span><span>)</span></a>(b) and (c), a SIP server has multiple
    neighbors from which only some may support overload control. If a
    server would simply use this overload control mechanism, only
    those that support it would reduce traffic. Others would keep
    sending at the full rate and benefit from the throttling by the
    servers that support overload control. In other words, upstream
    neighbors that do not support overload control would be better off 
    than those that do.
</p>
<p>A SIP server should therefore use 5xx responses towards
    upstream neighbors that do not support overload control. The
    server should reject the same amount of requests with 5xx
    responses that would be otherwise be rejected/redirected by the

<p>It should be noted that changing overload control feedback
      can have a significant adverse effect on the overload control
      mechanism. For example, the policy in a border device might be to
      remove overload control feedback until the feedback reaches a
      certain threshold. However, this intervention in the overload
      control feedback loop can cause an overload control algorithm to
      overreact, since the algorithm would not see any effects of the
      feedback generated. Once the feedback passes through the filter, it
      would likely reduce traffic too much and causing the control
      algorithm to again steer into the opposite direction. For this
      reason, it is NOT RECOMMENDED that a border device changes or
      partially removes overload control feedback.

<p>A SIP service provider may choose to remove all overload

<a name="rfc.section.5.2"></a><h3>5.2.&nbsp;
Creating the 'oc' Parameter</h3>

<p>A SIP server can provide overload control feedback to its
      upstream neighbors by adding the 'oc' parameter to the topmost
      Via header field of a SIP response. The 'oc' parameter is a new 
      Via header parameter defined in this specification. When an 'oc'
      parameter is added to a response, it MUST be inserted into the
      topmost Via header. It MUST NOT be added to any other Via header
      in the response. The topmost Via header is determined after the
      SIP server has removed its own Via header. It is the Via header
      that was generated by the next upstream neighbor.
</p>
<p>Since the topmost Via header of a response will be removed by
      an upstream neighbor after processing it, overload control
      feedback contained in the 'oc' parameter will not travel beyond
      the next SIP server. A Via header parameter therefore provides
      hop-by-hop semantics for overload control feedback even if the 
      next hop neighbor does not support this specification. 
</p>
<p>A SIP server SHOULD add an 'oc' parameter to those responses,
      that contain an 'oc_accept' parameter in the topmost Via
      header. In this case, the SIP server MUST remove the 'oc_accept'
      parameter from the Via header and replace it with an 'oc'
      parameter.
</p>
<p>The 'oc' parameter can be used in all response types,
      including provisional, success and failure responses. A SIP
      server MAY generally add the 'oc' parameter to all responses it
      is sending. A SIP server MUST add an 'oc' parameter to responses
      when the transmission of overload control feedback is required
      by the overload control algorithm to limit the traffic received
      by the server. I.e., a SIP server MUST insert the 'oc' parameter
      when the overload control algorithm sets the 'oc' parameter to a
      value different from the default value.
</p>
<p>A SIP server that has added an 'oc' parameter to Via header
      SHOULD also add a 'oc_validity' parameter to the same Via
      header. The 'oc_validity' parameter defines the time in
      milliseconds during which the content (i.e., the overload
      control feedback) of the 'oc' parameter is valid. The default
      value of the 'oc_validity' parameter is 500. A SIP server SHOULD 
      use a shorter 'oc_validity' time if its overload status varies
      quickly and MAY use a longer 'oc_validity' time if this status
      is more stable. If the 'oc_validity' parameter is not present,
      its default value is used. The 'oc_validity' parameter MUST NOT
      be used in a Via header without an 'oc' parameter and MUST be
      ignored if it appears in a Via header without 'oc' parameter.
</p>
<p>A SIP server MAY forward the content of an 'oc' parameter it
      has received from a downstream neighbor on to its upstream
      neighbor. However, forwarding the content of the 'oc' parameter
      is generally NOT RECOMMENDED and should only be performed if
      permitted by the configuration of SIP servers. For example, a
      SIP server that only relays messages between exactly two SIP
      servers could forward an 'oc' parameter. The 'oc' parameter is
      forwarded by copying it from the Via in which it was received
      into the next Via header (i.e., the Via header that will be on
      top after processing the response). If an 'oc_validity'
      parameter is present, MUST be copied along with the 'oc'
      parameter.
</p>
<p>The 'oc' and 'oc_validity' Via header parameters are only
      defined in SIP responses and MUST NOT be used in SIP
      requests. These parameters are only useful to the upstream
      neighbor of a SIP server (i.e., the entity that is sending
      requests to the SIP server) since this is the entity that can
      offload traffic by redirecting/rejecting new requests. If
      requests are forwarded in both directions between two SIP
      servers (i.e., the roles of upstream/downstream neighbors
      change), there are also responses flowing in both
      directions. Thus, both two SIP servers can exchange overload
      information. While adding 'oc' and 'oc_validity' parameters to
      requests may increase the frequency with which overload
      information is exchanged in these scenarios, this increase will
      rarely provide benefits and does not justify the added overhead 
      and complexity needed.
</p>
<p>A SIP server MAY decide to add 'oc' and 'oc_validity'
      parameters only to responses that are sent via a secured
      transport channel such as TLS. The SIP server can use transport
      level authentication to identify the SIP servers, to which
      responses with these parameters are sent. This enables a SIP
      server to protect overload control information and ensure that
      it is only visible to trusted parties. Since overload control
      protects a SIP server from overload, it is RECOMMENDED that a
      SIP server generally inserts 'oc' and 'oc_validity' parameters
      into responses to all SIP servers.

Determining the 'oc' Parameter Value</h3>

<p>The value of the 'oc' parameter is determined by an overload

      specification does not mandate the use of a specific overload
      control algorithm. However, the output of an overload control
      algorithm MUST be compliant to the semantics of this header.
</p>
<p>The 'oc' parameter value specifies the percentage by which
      the load forwarded to this SIP server should be
      reduced. Possible values range from 0 (the traffic forwarded is 
      reduced by 0%, i.e., all traffic is forwarded) to 100 (the 
      traffic forwarded is reduced by 100%, i.e., no traffic
      forwarded). The default value of this parameter is 0. The 'oc'
      parameter value is determined by the overload control algorithm
      of the SIP server generating the 'oc' parameter.
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>OPEN ISSUE: the semantics of the 'oc' parameter depends on

        window-based overload control. It might be possible to allow
        multiple mechanisms to co-exist (e.g., by defining different
        parameters for the different feedback types). However, for
        interoperability purposes it seems preferable to agree on one

Processing the 'oc' Parameter</h3>

<p>A SIP entity compliant to this specification SHOULD remove
      'oc' and 'oc_validity' parameters in all Via headers of a

      from traveling upstream.

<p>A SIP server maintains the 'oc' parameter values received
      along with the address of the SIP servers from which they were
      received for the duration specified in the 'oc_validity'
      parameter or the default duration. Each time a SIP server
      receives a response with an 'oc' parameter from a SIP server, it
      overwrites the 'oc' value it has currently stored for this
      server with the new value received. The SIP server restarts the
      validity period of an 'oc' parameter each time a response with an
      'oc' parameter is received from this server. A stored 'oc'
      parameter value MUST be discarded once it has reached the end of
      its validity.

Using the 'oc' Parameter Value</h3>

<p>A SIP server compliant to this specification MUST honor 'oc'

      allowed by the current 'oc' parameter value from this server.
</p>
<p>When forwarding a SIP request, a SIP entity uses the SIP

      described in <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E.

      this value is non-zero, the SIP server MUST determine if it can
      or cannot forward the current request within the current throttle

</p>
<p>The SIP server MAY use the following algorithm to determine
      if it can forward the request. The SIP server draws a random
      number between 1 and 100 for the current request. If the random
      number is less than or equal to the 'oc' parameter value, the
      request is not forwarded. Otherwise, the request is forwarded as
      usual. Another algorithm for SIP entities that processes a large
      number of requests is to reject/redirect the first X of every
      100 requests processed. Other algorithms that lead to the same
      result may be used as well.

Rejecting Requests</h3>

<p>A SIP server that rejects a request because of overload MUST
      reject this request with the 5xx response code defined for
      overload control (e.g., 503 (Service Unavailable) or 507 (Server
      Overload) <a class='info' href='#I-D.hilt-sip-correction-503'>[I&#8209;D.hilt&#8209;sip&#8209;correction&#8209;503]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hilt, V. and I. Widjaja, &ldquo;Essential Correction to the       Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) 503 (Service Unavailable)       Response,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>). This
      response code indicates that the request did not succeed because
      the SIP servers processing the request are under overload.
</p>
<p>A SIP server that is under overload and has started to
      throttle incoming traffic SHOULD use 5xx response to reject a
      fraction of requests from upstream neighbors that do not include
      the 'oc_accept' parameter in their Via headers. These neighbors
      do not support this specification and will not respond to
      overload control feedback in the 'oc' parameter. The fraction of
      requests rejected SHOULD be equivalent to the fraction of
      requests the upstream server would reject/redirect if it did
      support this specification. This is to ensure that SIP servers,
      which do not support this specification, don't receive an unfair
      advantage over those that do. 
</p>
<p>A SIP server that has reached overload (i.e., a load close to   
      100) SHOULD start using 5xx responses in addition to using the
      'oc' parameter for all upstream neighbors. If the proxy has
      reached a load close to 100, it needs to protect itself against
      overload. Also, it is likely that upstream proxies have ignored
      overload feedback and do not support this specification.

Self-Limiting</h3>

<p>In some cases, a SIP server may not receive a response from a

      MUST be treated as a 503 (Service Unavailable) status code.
</p>
<p>In these cases, a SIP server SHOULD stop sending requests to
      this server. The SIP server SHOULD occasionally forward a single
      request to probe if the downstream neighbor is alive. Once a SIP

    parameters are used to implement an overload control feedback loop 
    between neighboring SIP servers.
</p>
<p>The 'oc' and 'oc_validity' parameters are only defined in
    the topmost Via header of a response. They MUST NOT be used in the
    Via headers of requests and MUST NOT be used in other Via headers
    of a response.  The 'oc' and 'oc_validity' parameters MUST be
    ignored if received outside of the topmost Via header of a
    response. The 'oc_accept' parameter MAY appear in all Via
    headers.
</p>
<p>The 'oc' Via header parameter contains a number between 0 and
    100. It describes the percentage by which the traffic to the SIP
    server from which the response has been received should be
    reduced. The default value for this parameter is 0.
</p>
<p>The 'oc_validity' Via header parameter contains the time during
    which the corresponding 'oc' Via header parameter is valid. The
    'oc_validity' parameter can only be present in a Via header in
    conjunction with an 'oc' parameter.
</p>
<p>The 'oc_accept' Via header parameter indicates that the SIP
    server, which has created this Via header, supports overload
    control.

Subscription Duration</h3>

<p>A subscription to the overload control event package is
      usually established when a SIP server first sends a request to
      another SIP server and terminated when this server stops sending
      requests and overload control is not needed any more.
</p>
<p>The duration of a subscription is related to the time a
      signaling relationship exists between two servers. In a static
      SIP server configuration (e.g., two SIP servers are configured
      to exchange messages in a service provider's network) this
      relationship can last for days or weeks as long as both servers
      are running. In this scenario, the subscription duration is
      largely irrelevant.
</p>
<p>In a dynamic configuration (e.g., two SIP servers in
      different domains) the duration of the signaling relationship 
      can be in the range of minutes or hours and might only last for
      the duration of a single session. Since it is unknown a priori
      when the next SIP request will be transmitted from the
      subscriber to the notifier, subscriber and notifier MAY
      terminate a subscription to overload control after a period of
      inactivity.
</p>
<p>The duration of a subscription to the overload control event
      package SHOULD be longer than the duration of a typical
      session. The default subscription duration for this event
      package is set to two hours.

<p>In this event package, the body of a notification contains

Notifier processing of SUBSCRIBE requests</h3>

<p>It is RECOMMENDED that a notifier provides overload control
      status information to all subscribers and that the notifier
      accepts all subscriptions to this event package. By denying a
      subscription to overload control, a notifier would disable
      overload control to this subscriber. Since this subscriber would
      not know the current overload status of the notifier, it would
      not reduce the traffic forwarded when the notifier enters an
      overload condition. Thus, denying a subscription to this event
      package can leave the notifier vulnerable to SIP overload. 
</p>
<p>A notifier MAY authenticate and authorize subscriptions to
      this event package. This is useful if the notifier wants to
      provide extended overload status information to certain
      subscribers. For example, a notifier can provide detailed
      resource usage information to authenticated subscribers and only
      provide the current throttle status to all other subscribers. The
      details of the authorization policy are at the discretion of the
      administrator.

Notifier generation of NOTIFY requests</h3>

<p>A notifier sends a notification in response to SUBSCRIBE

      any time during the subscription. Typically, the notifier will
      send a notification every time the overload control status has
      changed. For example, the notifier can create a notify every
      time the overload control value (e.g., the rate limit)
      changes.
</p>
<p>Overload status information is expressed in the format
      negotiated for the NOTIFY body (e.g.,
      "application/overload-info+xml"). The overload status in a
      NOTIFY body MUST be complete. Notifications that contain the
      deltas to previous overload status or a partial overload status
      are not supported in this event package.
</p>
<p>It is RECOMMENDED that the notifier returns an initial NOTIFY
      that contains at least the current overload control value immediately
      after receiving a SUBSCRIBE request. It is RECOMMENDED that the
      notifier returns such an initial NOTIFY even if the notifier is
      still waiting for an authorization decision. Once the
      subscription is authorized, the notifier MAY send another
      notification that then contains all information the subscriber
      is authorized to receive. It is RECOMMENDED that the notifier
      accepts a subscription and creates a NOTIFY with at least the
      current overload control value even if the subscriber is not authorized
      to receive more information.
</p>
<p>The timely delivery of overload control notifications is
      important for overload control. It is therefore RECOMMENDED that
      NOTIFY messages for this event package are sent with highest
      priority. I.e., the transmission of NOTIFY messages for this
      event package ought not to be delayed by other tasks.

      discussed in <a class='info' href='#sec:method'>Section&nbsp;3.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Overload Control Method</span><span>)</span></a> 
</p>
<p>A subscriber MUST use the overload state it has received
      for a SIP server until the subscriber receives another NOTIFY
      with an updated state or until the subscription is
      terminated. The subscriber SHOULD stop using the reported
      overload state once the subscription is terminated.
</p>
<p>It is RECOMMENDED that the subscriber processes incoming
      NOTIFY messages for this event package with highest
      priority. I.e., NOTIFY messages for this event package ought to
      be processed before other messages are processed. This is to
      ensure that a subscriber can react quickly to changes in the
      overload control status even if the subscriber is currently
      receiving a high volume of messages.

Handling of forked requests</h3>

<p>This event package allows the creation of only one dialog as
      a result of an initial SUBSCRIBE request. The techniques to
      achieve this behavior are described in <a class='info' href='#RFC3265'>[RFC3265]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Roach, A., &ldquo;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.6.11"></a><h3>6.11.&nbsp;
Rate of notifications</h3>

<p>Keeping the rate of notifications low is important for an
      overload control mechanism to avoid creating additional traffic in
      an overload condition. However, it is also important that an
      overload control algorithm can quickly adjust the overload
      control value as needed. Ideally, the overload control algorithm
      would generate a stable control value that rarely needs to be
      adjusted.
</p>
<p>The notifier SHOULD NOT generate NOTIFY messages at a rate
      faster once every 1 second for notifications that are triggered
      by a change in the control value. The notifier SHOULD NOT
      generate a NOTIFY message at a rate faster than once every 5
      seconds for all other notifications (i.e., for any additional
      information included in the subscription).

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>Overload control mechanisms can be used by an attacker to
    conduct a denial-of-service attack on a SIP entity if the attacker
    can pretend that the SIP entity is overloaded. When such a forged
    overload indication is received by an upstream SIP entity, it will
    stop sending traffic to the victim. Thus, the victim is 
    subject to a denial-of-service attack.
</p>
<p>An attacker can create forged overload feedback by inserting
    itself into the communication between the victim and its 
    upstream neighbors. The attacker would need to add overload
    feedback indicating a high load to the responses passed from the
    victim to its upstream neighbor. Proxies can prevent this attack by
    communicating via TLS. Since overload feedback has no meaning
    beyond the next hop, there is no need to secure the communication 
    over multiple hops.
</p>
<p>Another way to conduct an attack is to send a message
    containing a high overload feedback value through a proxy that does not
    support this extension. If this feedback is added to the second Via
    headers (or all Via headers), it will reach the next upstream
    proxy. If the attacker can make the recipient believe that the
    overload status was created by its direct downstream neighbor (and
    not by the attacker further downstream) the recipient stops
    sending traffic to the victim. A precondition for this attack is
    that the victim proxy does not support this extension since it
    would not pass through overload control feedback otherwise.
</p>
<p>A malicious SIP entity could gain an advantage by pretending to
    support this specification but never reducing the amount of
    traffic it forwards to the downstream neighbor. If its downstream
    neighbor receives traffic from multiple sources which correctly
    implement overload control, the malicious SIP entity would benefit
    since all other sources to its downstream neighbor would reduce
    load. 
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>OPEN ISSUE: the solution to this problem depends on the
      overload control algorithm. For a fixed message rate and
      window-based overload control, it is very easy for a downstream
      entity to monitor if the upstream neighbor throttles traffic
      forwarded as directed. For percentage throttling this is not
      always obvious since the load forwarded depends on the load
      received by the upstream neighbor.
