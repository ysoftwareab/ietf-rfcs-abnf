Abstract

  This document describes the LDAP/X.500 'entryUUID' operational
  attribute and associated matching rules and syntax.  The attribute
  holds a server-assigned Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for the
  object.  Directory clients may use this attribute to distinguish
  objects identified by a distinguished name or to locate an object
  after renaming.

INTERNET-DRAFT               LDAP entryUUID              25 October 2003


1. Background and Intended Use

  In X.500 Directory Services [X.501], such as those accessible using
  the the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC3377], an
  object is identified by its distinguished name (DN).  However, DNs are
  not stable identifiers.  That is, a new object may be identified by a
  DN which previously identified another (now renamed or deleted)
  object.

  This document describes the 'entryUUID' operational attribute which
  holds the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) [ISO11578] assigned to
  the object by the server.  Clients may use this attribute to
  distinguish objects identified by a distinguished name or to locate an
  object after renaming.

  This document defines the UUID syntax, the 'uuidMatch' and
  'uuidOrderingMatch' matching rules, the 'entryUUID' attribute type.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

  Schema definitions are provided using LDAP description formats
  [RFC2252].  Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped) for
  readability.


2. UUID Schema Elements

2.1 UUID Syntax

  A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) [ISO11578] is a 16-octet
  (128-bit) value which identifies an object.  The ASN.1 [X.690] type
  UUID is defined to represent UUIDs.

      UUID ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE(16))
            -- constrained to an UUID [ISO 11578]

  In LDAP, values of the UUID type are encoded using the [ASCII]
  character string representation described in [ISO11578].  For example,
  "597ae2f6-16a6-1027-98f4-d28b5365dc14".

  The following is a LDAP syntax description [RFC2252] suitable for
  publication in the subschema.

      ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1 DESC 'UUID' )

2.2 'uuidMatch' Matching Rule

  The 'uuidMatch' matching rule compares an asserted UUID with a stored
  UUID for equality.  Its semantics are same as the octetStringMatch
  [X.520][RFC2252] matching rule.   The rule differs from
  octetStringMatch in that the assertion value is encoded using the UUID
  string representation instead of the normal OCTET STRING string
  representation.

  The following is a LDAP matching rule description [RFC2252] suitable
  for publication in the subschema.

      ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2 NAME 'uuidMatch'
          SYNTAX IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1 )


2.3 'uuidOrderingMatch' Matching Rule

  The 'uuidOrderingMatch' matching rule compares an asserted UUID
  with a stored UUID for ordering.  Its semantics are the same as the
  octetStringOrderingMatch [X.520][RFC2252] matching rule.  The rule
  differs from octetStringOrderingMatch in that the assertion value
  is encoded using the UUID string representation instead of the
  normal OCTET STRING string representation.

  The following is a LDAP matching rule description [RFC2252] suitable
  for publication in the subschema.

      ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.3 NAME 'uuidMatch'
          SYNTAX IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1 )

  It is noted that not all UUID variants have a defined ordering and,
  even where so, servers are not obligated to assign UUIDs in any
  particular order.  This matching rule is provided for completeness.


2.4. 'entryUUID' attribute

  The 'entryUUID' operational attribute provides the Universally Unique
  Identifier (UUID) [ISO11578] assigned to the entry.

  The following is a LDAP attribute type description [RFC2252] suitable
  for publication in the subschema.

      ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.4 NAME 'entryUUID'
          DESC 'UUID of the entry'
          EQUALITY uuidMatch
          ORDERING uuidOrderingMatch

INTERNET-DRAFT               LDAP entryUUID              25 October 2003


          SYNTAX IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1
          SINGLE-VALUE
          NO-USER-MODIFICATION
          USAGE directoryOperation )

  Servers SHALL assign a UUID to each entry upon its addition to the
  directory  and provide the entry's UUID as the value of the
  'entryUUID' operational attribute.  An entry's UUID is immutable.


3. Security Considerations

  Servers should ensure that components of UUID values are publicly
  disclosable.

  General LDAP security considerations [RFC3377] apply.


4. IANA Considerations
