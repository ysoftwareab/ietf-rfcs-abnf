     2  Abstract 

        iSCSI is a SCSI transport protocol that maps the SCSI family of 
        protocols onto TCP/IP [iSCSI].  This document defines an additional 
        iSCSI node name type format to enable use of the NAA world wide naming 
        format used by ANSI T11 Fibre Channel protocols.  It is hoped that this 
        definition would enable storage devices containing both iSCSI and FC 
        ports to use the same NAA-based SCSI device name.

     3  Introduction 

        This document discusses the motivation for adding an NAA type format as 
        an iSCSI node name format and defines this format in accordance with the 
        iSCSI naming conventions. 

     4  Motivation 

        To date, there are a number of networked transports providing port 
        services to SCSI.  These transports all incorporate some form of world-
        wide unique name construction format.   

                             EUI-64  NAA  IQN 

            iSCSI              X           X 

            FC                        X      

            SAS                       X      

            Infiniband(SRP)    X            

         

        The NAA format is used by the Fibre Channel transport, the SAS protocol 
        made a recent decision to use NAA identifier formats.  This makes the 
        NAA format the most commonly used identifier format for SCSI transports.  
        Although one of the FC-defined NAA formats contains a mapping of EUI-64

        numbers, it requires some mathematical manipulation to extract the EUI-
        64 identifier out of this format, and the NAA EUI-64 mapping reserves 2 
        bits in the EUI-64 identifier, therefore reducing the EUI-64 namespace.  
        If iSCSI included a naming format that allowed direct representation of 
        an NAA-format name, it would facilitate ease of construction of a target 
        device name that translates easily across multiple namespaces for a 
        storage device containing ports served by different transports. 

        This document proposes adding an NAA type to the iSCSI naming formats in 
        order to enable economy of worldwide-unique identifier assignment for 
        multi-transport-enabled target devices: One NAA-type SCSI device name 
        can be chosen for a target having SAS SCSI ports, FC SCSI ports and 
        iSCSI SCSI ports.  [Note: Today, FCP-2 does not have a dependable notion 
        of SCSI device name.  It is however expected that FCP-3 is likely to 
        incorporate the idea of a device name, or platform name, subject to 
        T10Æs decisions. If it does embrace the device name notion, the same NAA 
        format could then form the basis for targets with SAS/FCP-3/iSCSI 
        ports.] 

        In addition, there is a movement afoot in T10 to define and report a 
        single SCSI target device name (based on iSCSI's naming formats), 
        especially when the SCSI device has multiple transports attached.  This 
        discussion arose as a result of a proposed change to SPC-3 (T10/02-
        419r0: SPC-3 iSCSI device identifiers) that adds a device name to VPD 
        page 83 device identifier page. Addition of the ANSI T11-defined NAA 
        format as an allowed type for iSCSI name creation would make the iSCSI 
        device naming format more palatable across all current SCSI networked 
        transports, allowing the creation of SCSI device names that are 
        transport-independent.  A single SCSI device name would allow creation 
        of LU names based on the SCSI device name - a converged string naming 
        architecture across transports helps to build LU names that are in turn 
        uniform. 

        The FC NAA formatted as an ASCII-hexidecimal representation has a 
        maximum size of 32 characters (128 bit formats) - as a result there is 
        no issue with this name format exceeding the maximimum size for iSCSI 
        node names.

     5  iSCSI Name Structure 

        In addition to the iSCSI name types of "iqn." and "eui." 

             type "naa." - the remainder of the string is an ANSI T10 defined 
             Network Address Authority identifier in ASCII-encoded hexadecimal. 

     5.1  Type "naa." - Network Address Authority 

        The ANSI T10 FC-FS specification defines a format for constructing 
        globally unique identifiers [FC-FS].  

        The iSCSI name format is "naa." followed by an NAA identifier (ASCII-
        encoded hexadecimal digits). 

           Example iSCSI name:  

              Type  NAA identifier (ASCII-encoded hexadecimal) 
              +--++--------------+  
              |  ||              |  

              naa.02004567BA64678D  

        The NAA iSCSI name format might be used in an implementation where the 
        structure for generating FC NAA worldwide unique names is already in 
        place because the device contains both Fibre Channel and iSCSI SCSI 
        ports. 

     6  Terminology 

     6.1  IQN 

        iSCSI qualified name, an identifier format defined by the iSCSI protocol 
        [iSCSI]. 

     6.2  SRP 

        SCSI RDMA Protocol.  SRP defines a SCSI protocol mapping onto the 
        InfiniBand (tm) Architecture and/or functionally similar cluster 
        protocols. [SRP] 

     6.3  SAS 

        Serial Attached SCSI. The Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) draft standard 
        contains both a physical Layer that is compatible with Serial ATA and 
        protocols for transporting SCSI commands to SAS devices and for 
        transporting ATA commands to SATA devices. [SAS]

     6.4  NAA 

        Network Address Authority - a naming format defined by the ANSI T11 
        Fibre Channel protocols [FC-FS]. 

     6.5  Infiniband 

        An I/O architecture intended to replace PCI and address high performance 
        server interconnect. [IB] 

         

     7  Security Considerations 

        Because this document does not define any new wire protocol, there are 
        no additional security considerations from that of using the iSCSI 
        protocol.
