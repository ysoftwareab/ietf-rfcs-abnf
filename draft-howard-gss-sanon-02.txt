1.  Introduction

   The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   [RFC2743] provides a framework for authentication and message
   protection services through a common programming interface.

   The Simple Anonymous mechanism described in this document (hereafter
   SAnon) is a simple protocol based on the X25519 elliptic curve
   Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement scheme defined in [RFC7748].  No
   authentication of initiator or acceptor is provided.  A potential use
   of SAnon is to provide a degree of privacy when bootstrapping unkeyed
   entities.

Internet-Draft                SAnon GSS-API                   April 2020


1.1.  Authentication

   The GSS-API protocol involves a client, known as the initiator,
   sending an initial security context token of a chosen GSS-API
   security mechanism to a peer, known as the acceptor.  The two peers
   subsequently exchange, synchronously, as many security context tokens
   as necessary to complete the authentication or fail.  The specific
   number of context tokens exchanged varies by security mechanism: in
   the case of the SAnon mechanism, it is two (i.e. a single round
   trip).  Once authentication is complete, the initiator and acceptor
   share a security context which can be used for integrity or
   confidentiality, protecting subsequent application messages.

1.2.  Application Services

   GSS-API provides a number of a services to the calling application:

   GSS_Wrap()  integrity and optional confidentiality for a message

   GSS_GetMIC()  integrity for a message sent separately

   GSS_Pseudo_random()  shared key derivation (e.g., for keying external
      confidentiality and integrity layers)

   These services are used with security contexts having a shared
   session key to protect application-layer messages.

2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Discovery and Negotiation

   The means of discovering GSS-API peers and their supported mechanisms
   is out of this specification's scope.  Mechanisms are typically
   explicitly selected by the initiator, or selected from a set of
   common mechanisms using the Simple and Protected Negotiation
   mechanism (SPNEGO) defined in [RFC4178].  An initiator that that
   supports the [I-D.zhu-negoex] protocol MUST negotiate SAnon using
   NegoEx rather than using SPNEGO directly.  Initiators that do not
   support NegoEx MAY negotiate SAnon directly under SPNEGO.

   To avoid multiple negotiation layers and implementation complexity,
   this specification is deliberately not crypto-agile.  A future
   variant using a different key exchange algorithm would be assigned a
   different mechanism OID and authentication scheme identifier.

   If anonymity is not desired then SAnon MUST NOT be used.  Either
   party can test for the presence of GSS_C_ANON_FLAG to check if
   anonymous authentication was performed.

4.  Naming

   The GSS-API provides a rich security principal naming model.  At its
   most basic the query forms of names consist of a user-entered/
   displayable string and a "name-type".  Name-types are constants with
   names prefixed with "GSS_C_NT_" in the GSS-API.

4.1.  GSS Name Types

4.1.1.  GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME

   This name type is supported when the input name string is the well
   known anonymous name string, WELLKNOWN/ANONYMOUS@WELLKNOWN:ANONYMOUS.
   In all other cases, importing the name MUST fail.

4.1.2.  GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE

   This name type identifies a host-based service and is generally used
   by acceptors.  To allow existing applications to work unmodified with
   SAnon, it is useful to allow anonymous acceptor credentials to be
   acquired regardless of the service name.  (It follows from SAnon not
   performing mutual authentication that the acceptor identity is
   meaningless.)  When importing a name of this type the name string
   SHOULD be ignored.

4.1.3.  GSS_C_NT_DOMAINBASED_SERVICE

   The [RFC5179] name type, along with all other acceptor name types,
   are treated identically to GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE.

4.1.4.  GSS_C_NT_ANONYMOUS

   When importing a name of this type the name string MUST be ignored.
   Functions that return a name type to the caller MUST always return
   this name type.  The display form is the well known anonymous name
   string, WELLKNOWN/ANONYMOUS@WELLKNOWN:ANONYMOUS.  This is always the
   name observed by a SAnon peer.

4.2.  Canonicalization

   The SAnon GSS-API mechanism has a single anonymous identity, the well
   known anonymous name.  The canonical form is the well known anonymous
   name string with the GSS_C_NT_ANONYMOUS name type.

4.3.  Mechanism Selection Hints

   Many deployed applications do not have explicit support for anonymous
   authentication.  To ease deployment, we recommend allowing anonymous
   authentication to be requested by the initiator acquiring a
   credential with a well known anonymous name.  This may allow the end-
   user to request anonymous authentication directly, without requiring
   the application be modified to support GSS_C_ANON_FLAG.  The well
   known anonymous name has the same display form as in Kerberos
   [RFC8062], allowing acceptors to perform name-based authorization in
   a mechanism-agnostic manner.

   This approach may, however, disadvantage applications that wish to
   use GSS_C_ANON_FLAG to select anonymous authentication, as importing
   a non-anonymous initiator name would fail with this approach.  We
   consider this an acceptable compromise given the limited deployment
   of GSS_C_ANON_FLAG in existing implementations.

5.  Mechanism Attributes

   The [RFC5587] mechanism attributes for this mechanism are:

      GSS_C_MA_MECH_CONCRETE

      GSS_C_MA_ITOK_FRAMED

      GSS_C_MA_AUTH_INIT_ANON

      GSS_C_MA_AUTH_TARG_ANON

      GSS_C_MA_INTEG_PROT

      GSS_C_MA_CONF_PROT

      GSS_C_MA_MIC

      GSS_C_MA_WRAP

      GSS_C_MA_REPLAY_DET

      GSS_C_MA_OOS_DET

      GSS_C_MA_CBINDINGS

      GSS_C_MA_PFS

      GSS_C_MA_CTX_TRANS

6.  Definitions and Token Formats

6.1.  Context Establishment Tokens

6.1.1.  Initial context token

   The initial context token is framed per Section 1 of [RFC2743]:

   GSS-API DEFINITIONS ::=
        BEGIN

        MechType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER
        -- representing SAnon mechanism
        GSSAPI-Token ::=
        [APPLICATION 0] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE {
            thisMech MechType,
            innerToken ANY DEFINED BY thisMech
                -- 32 byte initiator public key
        }
        END

   On the first call to GSS_Init_sec_context(), the mechanism checks for
   one of the following:

      The caller set anon_req_flag (GSS_C_ANON_FLAG); or

      The claimant_cred_handle identity is the well known anonymous
      name; or

      The claimant_cred_handle is the default credential and targ_name
      an anonymous name.

   If none of the above are the case, the call MUST fail with
   GSS_S_UNAVAILABLE.

   If proceeding, the initiator generates a fresh secret and public key
   pair per Section 6.1 of [RFC7748] and returns GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED
   indicating that a subsequent context token from the acceptor is
   expected.  The innerToken field of the output_token contains the
   initiator's 32 byte public key.

6.1.2.  Acceptor context token

   Upon receiving a context token from the initiator, the acceptor
   validates that the token is well formed and contains a public key of
   the requisite length.  The acceptor generates a fresh secret and
   public key pair.  A session key is computed as specified in
   Section 7.

Internet-Draft                SAnon GSS-API                   April 2020


   The acceptor constructs an output_token by concatenating its public
   key with the token emitted by calling GSS_GetMIC() with the default
   QOP and zero-length octet string.  The output token is sent to the
   initiator without additional framing.

   The acceptor then returns GSS_S_COMPLETE, setting src_name to the
   well known anonymous name.  The reply_det_state (GSS_C_REPLAY_FLAG),
   sequence_state (GSS_C_SEQUENCE_FLAG), conf_avail (GSS_C_CONF_FLAG),
   integ_avail (GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG) and anon_state (GSS_C_ANON_FLAG)
   security context flags are set to TRUE.  The context is ready to use.

6.1.3.  Initiator context completion

   Upon receiving the acceptor context token and verifying it is well
   formed, the initiator extracts the acceptor's public key (being the
   first 32 bytes of the input token) and computes the session key per
   Section 7.  The initiator then calls GSS_VerifyMIC() with the default
   QOP and zero-length octet string.  If successful, the initiator
   returns GSS_S_COMPLETE to the caller, to indicate the initiator is
   authenticated and the context is ready for use.  No output token is
   emitted.  Security context flags are set as for the acceptor context.

6.2.  Per-Message Tokens

   The per-message tokens definitions are imported from [RFC4121]
   Section 4.2.  The base key used to derive specific keys for signing
   and sealing messages is the session key defined in Section 7.  The
   [RFC3961] encryption and checksum algorithms use the aes128-cts-hmac-
   sha256-128 encryption type defined in [RFC8009].  The AcceptorSubkey
   flag as defined in [RFC4121] Section 4.2.2 MUST be set.

6.3.  Context Deletion Tokens

   Context deletion tokens are empty in this mechanism.  The behavior of
   GSS_Delete_sec_context() [RFC2743] is as specified in [RFC4121]
   Section 4.3.

6.4.  Exported Name Tokens

   The exported name token format for the SAnon GSS-API mechanism is the
   same as the display form, plus the standard exported name token
   format header mandated by the GSS-API [RFC2743].

7.  Key derivation

   The ECDH shared secret k is computed by calling the X25519 function
   with the local secret key and the peer's public key, as specified in
   Section 6.1 of [RFC7748].  The context session key (K1) is computed

   using a key derivation function from Section 5.1 of [SP800-108] with
   HMAC as the PRF:

      K1 = HMAC-SHA-256(key, 0x00000001 | label | 0x00 | context | k)

   where:

   k             the X25519 shared secret computed above

   0x00000001    the iteration count from Section 5.1 of [SP800-108]

   label         the string "sanon-x25519" (without quotation marks)

   context       the concatenation of the initiator and acceptor public
                 keys, along with the channel binding application data
                 (if present), in that order

   The inclusion of channel bindings in the key derivation function
   means that the acceptor cannot ignore initiator channel bindings;
   this differs from some other mechanisms.

   This session key is equivalent to the acceptor-asserted subkey
   defined in [RFC4121] Section 2 and is used as the base key for
   generating keys for per-message tokens and the GSS-API PRF.

   The session key encryption type is aes128-cts-hmac-sha256-128 as
   defined in [RFC8009].  The [RFC3961] algorithm protocol parameters
   are as given in [RFC8009] Section 5.

8.  Pseudo-Random Function

   The [RFC4401] GSS-API pseudo-random function for this mechanism
   imports the definitions from [RFC8009], using the context session key
   as the base key for both GSS_C_PRF_KEY_FULL and GSS_C_PRF_KEY_PARTIAL
   usages.

9.  NegoEx

   The NegoEx authentication scheme identifier for this mechanism is
   DEE384FF-1086-4E86-BE78-B94170BFD376.

   The initiator and acceptor keys for NegoEx checksum generation and
   verification are derived using the PRF from the previous section,
   with the input data "sanon-x25519-initiator-negoex-key" and "sanon-
   x25519-acceptor-negoex-key" respectively (without quotation marks).

   No NegoEx metadata is specified.  Any metadata present MUST be
   ignored.

11.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a GSS-API security mechanism, and therefore
   deals in security and has security considerations text embedded
   throughout.  This section only addresses security considerations
   associated with the SAnon mechanism described in this document.  It
   does not address security considerations associated with the GSS-API
   itself.

   This mechanism provides only for key agreement.  It does not
   authenticate or identify either party.  It MUST not be selected if
   either party requires identification of its peer.

12.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an OID for this GSS-API mechanism in the
   SMI numbers registry, with the prefix of
   iso.org.dod.internet.security.mechanisms (1.3.6.1.5.5) and to
   reference this specification in the registry.
