<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
   This memo documents a process intended to organize the future development of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and related work in the Real-Time Applications and Infrastructure (RAI) Area. 
As the environments in which SIP is deployed grow more numerous and diverse, modifying or extending SIP in certain ways may threaten the interoperability and security of the protocol; however, the IETF process must also cater to the realities of existing deployments and serve the needs of the implementers working with SIP.
This document therefore defines the functions of two long-lived working groups in the RAI Area which are, respectively, responsible for the maintenance of the core SIP specifications and development of new efforts to extend and apply work in this space. This document obsoletes RFC3427.

History and Development</h3>

<p>
	The <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3261] has grown well beyond its origins in
 Internet-based
   multimedia sessions, and now enjoys widespread popularity in Voice over IP or IP telephony applications, both inside IETF and within other standards groups.  One result of this popularity has
   been a continual flood of proposals for SIP modifications and
   extensions.  The challenge for IETF management of SIP has been to preserve baseline interoperability across its many implementations
        
</p>
<p>
In order to defend SIP against changes that might reduce interoperability, the working group chairs and Area Directors responsible for its management authored the <a class='info' href='#RFC3427'>SIP change process<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mankin, A., Bradner, S., Mahy, R., Willis, D., Ott, J., and B. Rosen, &ldquo;Change Process for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3427]. SIP change defined the role of the SIP and SIPPING working groups in shepherding ongoing work on the SIP standard. It also defined ways that external working groups or bodies could define extensions intended for limited usage, especially through the "P-" header field mechanism.
        
</p>
<p>
Over time, however, the management structure of RFC3427 has demonstrated some limitations. The first and most significant of these concerns "P-" header fields. While "P-" header fields require expert review and IESG shepherding, in practice IETF oversight of these header fields is quite limited, and the value added by the IETF supervising their development remains unclear. More importantly, the presence of a "P-" in front of a header field name does nothing to prevent a popular header field from seeing deployment outside of the original "limited usage" it envisioned; a prominent example of this today is the P-Asserted-Identity (PAID) header field, described in <a class='info' href='#RFC3325'>RFC3325<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jennings, C., Peterson, J., and M. Watson, &ldquo;Private Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Asserted Identity within Trusted Networks,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3325].
        
</p>
<p>
Consequently, this document obsoletes RFC3427 and describes a new structure for the management of deliverables in the Real-time Applications and Infrastructure Area.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
The IETF SIPCORE Working Group</h3>

<p>
   Historically, the IETF SIP Working Group (sip) was chartered to be the "owner"
   of the <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>SIP protocol<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3261] for the duration of the working group.  All
   changes or extensions to SIP were first required to exist as SIP Working Group
   documents.  The SIP working group was charged with being the guardian
   of the SIP protocol for the Internet, and therefore was mandated only
   to extend or change the SIP protocol when there are compelling reasons
   to do so.
        
</p>
<p>
The SIPCORE working group replaces the function of the SIP working group in the original RFC3427 account.
   Documents that must be handled by the SIPCORE working group include all documents which update or obsolete RFC3261 through RFC3265 or their successors.  All SIP extensions considered in SIPCORE must be standards track. They may be based upon requirements developed externally in other IETF working groups.
        
</p>
<p>
Typical IETF working groups do not live forever; SIPCORE's charter is however open-ended in order to allow it to remain the place where core SIP development will continue.  In the event that the SIPCORE working
   group has closed and no suitable replacement or follow-on working
   group is active (and this specification also has not been superseded), then when modifications to the core SIP protocol are proposed the RAI Area Directors will use the non-working
   group standards track document process (described in Section 6.1.2 of
   <a class='info' href='#RFC2026'>RFC 2026<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2026]) using the SIPCORE
   mailing list and designated experts from the SIP community for
   review.
        
</p>
<p>
   It is appropriate for any IETF working group to develop <a class='info' href='#RFC3265'>SIP event packages<span> (</span><span class='info'>Roach, A., &ldquo;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3265], but the working group must have charter approval to do so.  The
   IETF will also require RFC5226 IETF Review for the registration of
   event packages developed outside the scope of an IETF working group.
   Instructions for event package registrations are provided in
   <a class='info' href='#event'>Section&nbsp;4.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>SIP Event Packages</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
The IETF DISPATCH Working Group</h3>

<p>
   Historically, the IETF Session Initiation Protocol Proposal Investigation (sipping)
   Working Group was chartered to be a filter in front of the SIP Working
   Group.  This working group investigated requirements for
   applications of SIP, some of which led to requests for
   extensions to SIP.  These requirements may come from the community at
   large, or from individuals who are reporting the requirements as
   determined by another standards body.
        
</p>
<p>
The DISPATCH working group replaces the function of the SIPPING WG, although with several important changes to its functionality, the most notable being that its scope expands beyond just SIP to the entire work of the RAI Area. Like SIPPING, DISPATCH considers new proposals for work in the RAI Area, but rather than taking on specification deliverables as charter items itself, DISPATCH identifies the proper venue for work. If no such venue yet exists in the RAI Area, DISPATCH will develop charters and consensus for a BoF, working group, or <a class='info' href='#RFC5111'>exploratory group<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aboba, B. and L. Dondeti, &ldquo;Experiment in Exploratory Group Formation within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),&rdquo; January&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5111] as appropriate. Unlike the previous change structure, a DISPATCH review of any proposed change to core SIP is not required before it progresses to SIPCORE; however, any new proposed work which does not clearly fall within the charter of an existing RAI Area effort should be examined by DISPATCH.
        
</p>
<p>
In reaction to a proposal, the DISPATCH Working Group may determine: that these requirements justify a change to the core SIP specifications (RFC3261 through RFC3265) and thus any resulting work must transpire in SIPCORE, that the requirements do not change the SIP core specifications but require a new effort in the RAI area (be that a working group, a BoF, or what have you), that the requirements fall within the scope of existing chartered work in the RAI Area, or that the proposal should not be acted upon at this time.  Because the SIP protocol gets so much attention, some application
   designers may want to use it just because it is there, such as for
   controlling household appliances.  DISPATCH should act as a filter,
   accepting only proposals which play to the strengths of SIP, not those that confuse its applicability or ultimately reduce its usefulness as a means for immediate personal communications on the Internet.
        
</p>
<p>
In practice, it is expected that the DISPATCH WG behaves as a RAI "Open Area" working group, similar to those employed in other areas of the IETF. While it does not have the traditional deliverables of a working group, DISPATCH may at the discretion of its chairs and Area Directors adopt milestones, in accordance with standard working group milestone adoption procedures, such as the production of charter text for a BoF or working group, a "-00" problem statement document that explicates a proposed work effort, or a document explaining why a particular direction for standards development was not pursued.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Introducing New Work to RAI</h3>

<p>
When proposals arise for modifications or extensions to SIP outside the scope of existing chartered RAI Area work, they must be written up as a problem statement
(preferably as an Internet-Draft) explaining the problem they are trying to
   solve, why SIP is the applicable protocol, and why the existing SIP
   protocol will not work.  The problem statement must include a detailed
   set of requirements (distinct from solutions) that SIP would need to
   meet to solve the particular problem.  The problem statement must also
   describe in detail any security issues that arise from meeting those
   requirements.  After the problem statement is published, the authors
   should send a note to the DISPATCH Working Group mailing list to start
   discussion on the problem.

        
</p>
<p>
 The DISPATCH working group chairs, in conjunction with the RAI Area
   Directors, will determine if the particular problems raised in the
   requirements problem statement are indeed outside the charter of existing efforts, and if so, if they warrant a DISPATCH milestone for the definition of a new effort; this DISPATCH deliverable may take the form of a problem statement Internet-Draft, charter or similar milestone that provides
enough information to make a decision, but must not include protocol development.  The DISPATCH working
   group should consider whether the requirements can be merged with
   other requirements from other applications, and refine the problem statement
   accordingly.
        
</p>
<p>
   Once a new effort has been defined in DISPATCH and there is working group consensus that it should go forward, if the new effort will take the form of a working group or BoF, then the ADs
   will present the proposed new effort charter to the IESG
   and IAB, in accordance with the usual chartering process. If the new effort involves the rechartering of an existing working group, then similarly the existing working group rechartering functions will be performed by the appropriate WG chairs and ADs.
   If the IESG (with IAB advice) approves of the new charter or BoF, the
   DISPATCH working group has completed its deliverable and the new effort becomes autonomous.
        
</p>
<p>
 Anyone proposing requirements for new work is welcome to jointly develop, in a separate Internet-Draft, a mechanism that would meet the requirements.  No working group is required to adopt the
   proposed solution from this additional Internet-Draft.
        
</p>
<p>
  Work overseen by the SIPCORE Working Group is required to protect the architectural
   integrity of SIP and must not add features that do not have general
   use beyond the specific case.  Also, SIPCORE must not add features just
   to make a particular function more efficient at the expense of
   simplicity or robustness.
        
</p>
<p>
   Some working groups generate requirements for SIP
   solutions and/or extensions.  At the time this document was
   written, some groups with such chartered deliverables include SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence
   Leveraging Extensions (simple), Basic Level of Interoperability for
   SIP Services (bliss) and Session Peering for Multimedia Interconnect
   (speermint).
        
</p>
<p>
   The RAI ADs may, on an exceptional, case by case basis, support a process in which
   the requirements analysis is implicit and a RAI area working group handling extensions to SIP
   requests the addition of a charter item for an extension without a
   full DISPATCH process as described.

Extensibility and Architecture</h3>

<p>
   In an idealized protocol model, extensible design would be self-
   contained, and it would be inherent that new extensions and new
   header fields would naturally have an architectural coherence with the
   original protocol.
        
</p>
<p>
  However, this idealized vision has not been attained in the world of
   standards track protocols.  While interoperability implications can
   be addressed by capabilities negotiation rules, the effects of adding
   features that overlap, or that deal with a point solution and are
   not general, are much harder to control with rules.  Therefore, the RAI Area
   calls for architectural guardianship and application of Occam's Razor
   by the SIPCORE and DISPATCH Working Groups.
        
</p>
<p>
   In keeping with the IETF tradition of "running code and rough
   consensus", it is valid to allow for the development of SIP
   extensions that are either not ready for standards track, but might
   be understood for that role after some running code, or are private
   or proprietary in nature, because a characteristic motivating them is
   usage that is known not to fit the Internet architecture for SIP. In the past, header fields associated with those extensions were called "P-" header fields, for "preliminary", "private", or
   "proprietary".
        
</p>
<p>
However, the "P-" header field process has not served the purpose for which it was designed - namely, to restrict to closed environments the usage of mechanisms the IETF would not (yet) endorse for general usage. In fact, some "P-" header fields have enjoyed widespread implementation; because of the "P-" prefix, however, there seems to be no plausible migration path to designate these as general-usage header fields without trying to force implausible changes on large installed bases. 
        
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, this specification deprecates the previous RFC3427 guidance on the creation of "P-" header fields. Existing "P-" header fields are to be handled by user agents and proxy servers as the "P-" header field specifications describe; the deprecation of the change process mechanism entails no change in protocol behavior. New proposals to document SIP header fields of an experimental or private nature, however, shall not use the 'P-" prefix (unless existing deployments or standards use the prefix already, in which case they may be admitted as grandfathered cases at the discretion of the Designated Expert).
        
</p>
<p>
Instead, the registration of SIP header fields in Informational RFCs, or in documents outside the IETF, is now permitted under the Designated Expert (per RFC5226) criteria. The future use of any header field field name prefix ("P-" or "X-" or what have you) to designate SIP header fields of limited applicability is discouraged. Experts are advised to review documents for overlap with existing chartered work in the RAI Area, and are furthermore instructed to ensure the following two criteria are met:
        
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
    The proposed header field MUST be of a purely informational nature, and
       MUST NOT significantly change the behavior of SIP entities which
       support it.  Header fields which merely provide additional information
       pertinent to a request or a response are acceptable; these header fields are thus expected to have few, if any, implications for interoperability and backwards compatibility. Similarly, header fields which provide data consumed by applications at the ends of SIP's rendez-vous function, rather than changing the behavior of the rendez-vous function, are likely to be information in this sense.  If the
       header fields redefine or contradict normative behavior defined in
       standards track SIP specifications, that is what is meant by
       significantly different behavior. Ultimately, the significance of differences in behavior is a judgment call that must be made by the expert reviewer. 
        
</li>
<li>
The proposed header field MUST NOT undermine SIP security in any sense.
       The Internet Draft proposing the new header field MUST address security
       issues in detail as if it were a Standards Track document.  Note
       that, if the intended application scenario makes certain
       assumptions regarding security, the security considerations only
       need to meet the intended application scenario rather than the
       general Internet case.  In any case, security issues need to be
       discussed for arbitrary usage scenarios (including the general
       Internet case).
        
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that the deprecation of the "P-" header field process does not alter processes for the registration of SIP methods, URI parameters, response codes, or option tags.

SIP Event Packages</h3>

<p>
   SIP events <a class='info' href='#RFC3265'>[RFC3265]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Roach, A., &ldquo;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> defines two different types of event packages: normal
   event packages, and event template-packages.  Event template-packages
   can only be created and registered by the publication of a Standards
   Track RFC (from an IETF Working Group). Note that the guidance in RFC3265
   states that the IANA registration policy for normal event packages is
   "First Come First Serve"; this document replaces that policy with the
   following:
        
</p>
<p>
   Individuals may wish to publish SIP Event packages that they believe fall outside the scope of any chartered work currently in RAI.  Individual
   proposals for registration of a SIP event package MUST first be
   published as Internet-drafts for review by the DISPATCH Working Group,
   or the working group, mailing list, or expert designated by the RAI
   Area Directors if the DISPATCH Working Group has closed.  Proposals
   should include a strong motivational section, a thorough description
   of the proposed syntax and semantics, event package considerations,
   security considerations, and examples of usage.  Authors should
   submit their proposals as individual Internet- Drafts, and post
   an announcement to the working group mailing list to begin
   discussion.  The DISPATCH Working Group will determine if a proposed
   package is a) an appropriate usage of SIP which should be spun into a new effort, b) applicable to SIP but
   not sufficiently interesting, general, or in-scope to adopt as a
   working group effort, c) contrary to similar work chartered in an existing effort, or d) recommended to be adopted as or merged with chartered
   work elsewhere in RAI.
      
</p>
<p>
  "RFC Required" in conjunction with "Designated Expert" (both as defined in RFC5226) is the procedure for registration of event
   packages developed outside the scope of an IETF working group,
   according to the following guidelines:
      </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
    A Designated Expert (as defined in RFC5226) must review
       the proposal for applicability to SIP and conformance with these
       guidelines.  The Designated Expert will send email to the IESG on
       this determination.  The expert reviewer can cite one or more of
       the guidelines that have not been followed in his/her opinion.
      
</li>
<li>
   The proposed extension MUST NOT define an event template-package.
      
</li>
<li>
     The function of the proposed package MUST NOT overlap with
       current or planned chartered packages.
      
</li>
<li>
     The event package MUST NOT redefine or contradict the normative
       behavior of SIP events <a class='info' href='#RFC3265'>[RFC3265]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Roach, A., &ldquo;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, SIP <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E.

       extensions. (See <a class='info' href='#extend'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Extensibility and Architecture</span><span>)</span></a>)
      
</li>
<li>
    The proposed package MUST NOT undermine SIP security in any
       sense.  The Internet Draft proposing the new package MUST address
       security issues in detail as if it were a Standards Track
       document.  Security issues need to be discussed for arbitrary
       usage scenarios (including the general Internet case).
      
</li>
<li>
  The proposed package MUST be clearly documented in an
       (Individual) Informational RFC, and registered with IANA.  The
       package MUST document all the package considerations required in
       Section 5 of SIP events <a class='info' href='#RFC3265'>[RFC3265]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Roach, A., &ldquo;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>.
      
</li>
<li>
 If determined by the Designated Expert or the chairs or ADs of
       the DISPATCH WG, an applicability statement in the Informational
       RFC MUST clearly document the useful scope of the proposal, and
       explain its limitations and why it is not suitable for the
       general use of SIP in the Internet.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>
   Complex and indeterminate and hard-to-define protocol behavior,
   depending on the interaction of many optional extensions, is a fine breeding
   ground for security flaws.
        
</p>
<p>
All Internet-Drafts that present new requirements for SIP must
   include a discussion of the security requirements and implications
   inherent in the proposal.  All RFCs that modify or extend SIP must
   show that they have adequate security, must consider the security implications of feature interactions, and most of all must not worsen SIP's
   existing security considerations.

IANA Considerations</h3>

Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3261]  directs the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
   to establish a registry for SIP method names, a registry for SIP
   option tags, and a registry for SIP response codes, and to amend the
   practices used for the existing registry for SIP header fields.
   Reiterating the guidance of RFC3261, method names, option tags and
 SIP response codes require a Standards Action for inclusion in the
   IANA registry. Authors of specifications should also be aware that the SIP parameter registry is further elaborated in <a class='info' href='#RFC3968'>RFC3968<span> (</span><span class='info'>Camarillo, G., &ldquo;The Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA) Header Field Parameter Registry for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; December&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3968].
        
</p>
<p>
Previously in RFC3427, all new SIP header field registrations required a Standards Action (per RFC5226) with the exception of "P-" header fields; now, Informational registration of non-"P-" header fields is permitted if approved by a Designated Expert, as described in <a class='info' href='#extend'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Extensibility and Architecture</span><span>)</span></a>.
        
</p>
<p>
   Each RFC shall include an IANA Considerations section which directs
   IANA to create appropriate registrations.  Registration shall be done
   at the time the IESG announces its approval of the draft containing
   the registration requests.
        
</p>
<p>
Standard header fields and messages MUST NOT begin with the leading
   characters "P-". Existing "P-" header field registrations are considered grandfathered, but new registrations of Informational header fields should not begin with the leading characters "P-" (unless the "P-" would preserve compatibility with an pre-existing unregistered usage of the header field, at the discretion the Designated Expert). Short forms of header fields MUST only be assigned to standards track
   header fields. 
        
</p>
<p>
   Similarly, <a class='info' href='#RFC3265'>RFC 3265<span> (</span><span class='info'>Roach, A., &ldquo;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3265] directs the IANA to establish a registry for
   SIP event packages and SIP event template packages.  For event
   template packages, registrations must follow the RFC5226 processes
   for Standards Action within an IETF working group.  For normal event packages, as stated
   previously registrations minimally require RFC5226 "RFC Required" with "Designated Expert".  In either
   case, the IESG announcement of RFC approval authorizes IANA to make the
   registration.

Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>
 The credit for the notion that SIP required careful management belongs to the original authors: Allison
   Mankin, Scott Bradner, Rohan Mahy, Dean Willis, Joerg Ott, and Brian
   Rosen.  The current editors have provided only an update
   to reflect lessons learned from running the code, the changing situation of the IETF and the IANA
   registration procedures. Gonzalo Camarillo was instrumental to the development of the concept of SIPCORE and DISPATCH. Useful comments were provided by Jonathan Rosenberg, Mary Barnes, Dan York, John Elwell, Alan Johnston, Spencer Dawkins, Alfred Hines, Russ Housley and Dean Willis. The thorough review from Stephen Hanna of the Security Directorate proved enormously valuable. The authors also appreciaed IESG feedback from Alexey Melnikov, Adrian Farrel, Dan Romascanu and Magnus Westerlund.
        
</p>
<p>
   The original authors thanked their IESG and IAB colleagues
   (especially Randy Bush, Harald Alvestrand, John Klensin, Leslie
   Daigle, Patrik Faltstrom, and Ned Freed) for valuable discussions of
   extensibility issues in a wide range of protocols, including those
   that our area brings forward and others.  Thanks to the many members
   of the SIP community engaged in interesting dialogue about this
   document as well; including and especially Jonathan Rosenberg,
   Henning Schulzrinne and William Marshall.
