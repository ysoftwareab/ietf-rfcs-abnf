                                Abstract


   RFC 2418 outlines the procedures for IETF Session operation. However,
   it contains little information about post-IETF meeting working group
   chair responsibilities. In particular, it gives little guidance with
   respect to either form or submission deadlines for the artifacts of
   the meeting, namely, session minutes and presentation materials. This
   document addresses those issues.

1.  Introduction


   Section 3.1 of RFC 2418 [RFC2418] outlines the procedures for IETF
   Working Group operation. However, it contains little information
   about post-IETF meeting working group chair responsibilities. In
   particular, it gives little guidance with respect to either form or
   submission deadlines for the artifacts of the session, namely,
   working group minutes and presentation slides. The remainder of this
   document focus on the format, submission procedure, and deadlines for
   both session (e.g., Working Group) minutes and presentation
   materials.

   The key words "MUST"", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC 2119].



1.1.  Minutes


   Section 3.1 of RFC 2418 mandates that "All working group sessions
   (including those held outside of the IETF meetings) shall be reported
   by making minutes available". And while there a brief discussion of
   the desired content (note that this is not required content),
   including the session agenda, an account of the discussion including
   any decisions made, and the list of attendees, it gives little other
   guidance. Further, while the IETF secretariat maintains
   "instructions" web pages [MINUTES], they provide only vague
   guidelines, and note that the format and content of the minutes is to
   be "is defined by the chair and minute-taker". As a result, IETF
   session minutes are of widely varying content and quality. In the
   following sections we outline a standard format for IETF session
   minutes, and a process for their submission.



1.2.  The Purpose of Session Minutes


   RFC 2418 states that "It is also good practice to note important
   decisions/consensus reached by email in the minutes of the next
   'live' session, and to summarize briefly the decision-making history
   in the final documents the WG produces."

   The suggestion here is that the purpose of the minutes is to
   summarize and document the history and activity (and in particular,



D. Meyer                                          Section 1.2.  [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: September 2004              March 2004


   any decision making activity) of the live meeting, both for those who
   could not attend, and for archival purposes.  Thus timely submission
   of minutes, along with standardized format and quality, are essential
   to the operation of the IETF process.

   The guiding principle behind the minutes, then, is that they must
   convey to a non-attending reader enough information to review the
   meeting activity and understand the meeting outcome. In general, the
   minutes must be of sufficient detail and accuracy such that if an
   event cannot be understood to have happened from the minutes, then
   the event in question "did not happen" at the meeting.




1.3.  Format


   Minutes should be submitted in the following format:

   <Working Group Name> (<gw abbreviation>) Minutes -- IETF<number>

   <Date>                <Time>
   =============================

   CHAIRS: <chair name> <chair email address>
           <co-chair1 name> <co-chair1 email address>
           ...

   Minutes recorded by <name> <email address>

   Agenda
   <agenda>

   Document Status
   <document status>
   #############################

   <Minutes>


   The following table expands on the above template:

    <Working Group Name>           Full working group name
    <gw abbreviation>              Working group abbreviation
    <number>                       Number of this IETF (e.g. 58)
    <Date>                         Date of the meeting, in MM DD, YYYY format
    <Time>                         Time of the meeting, in 24 hour time

1.3.1.  <Minutes> Format


   In general, session minutes serve two main functions. First, they
   provide a record of the issues discussed during the meeting, and
   those participating in the discussions for those who weren't in
   attendance. Second, they provide a record that can be used to review
   decisions that were made (such as those items on which the WG has
   reached consensus, etc). As such, standardized format, as well as
   quality and completeness, are essential to the operation of the IETF
   process. In particular, as noted in [MINUTES], "Minutes should
   provide a thorough summary of the issues discussed during the working
   group/BOF sessions".

   The main body of the <Minutes> section must be a prose description of
   the issues discussed at the meeting and any apparent conclusions
   reached in the room.  Other material may be included as supporting
   documentation from the meeting -- for example, transcript-style notes
   ("A said," then   "B said," then "C said"), or a detailed list of
   changes to a document.  These should be included as attachments to,
   and not replacements for, the <Minutes>.

   Finally, the minutes may include any other additional information
   that the working group chair deems appropriate as as  appendices or
   attachments.



1.3.2.  Length of Submitted Minutes


   Minutes should provide a thorough summary of the issues discussed
   during the working group/BOF sessions, and should BE limited to a
   maximum of six pages of text.



1.4.  Encoding


   While [MINUTES] states that "Minutes for the IETF proceedings must be
   submitted in ASCII form", the trend is towards allowing HTML format
   minutes for those cases in which the working group chair wants to
   emphasize flow or other formatting. To that end, those working group
   chairs concerned about preserving the formatting of minutes may
   submit minutes in HTML format.

   In summary, the minutes for the IETF proceedings must be submitted in



D. Meyer                                          Section 1.4.  [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: September 2004              March 2004


   ASCII form, and formatted either in either plain text format or in
   HTML. That is, non-ASCII binary formats such as JPEG [JPEG] or
   executable code such as Java [JAVA] must not be included in submitted
   minutes.

1.5.  Submission Procedure and Deadlines


   There are at least three places in IETF literature where the
   disposition of session minutes are discussed:

    o Section 3.1 of RFC 2418 states that "The minutes shall be
      submitted in printable ASCII text for publication in the
      IETF Proceedings, and for posting in the IETF Directories
      and are to be sent to: minutes@ietf.org".

    o The IETF Secretariat "minutes page" [MINUTES], which states
      that "Minutes for the IETF proceedings must be submitted in
      ASCII form by the end of two weeks following the meeting".

    o The IETF Secretariat "proceedings page" [PROCEEDINGS], which
      states that "The deadline for submission of minutes and
      presentation slides for inclusion in the IETF meeting
      proceedings is four weeks from the Friday of the meeting
      week."

   While RFC 2418 is silent on deadlines, and there is a discrepancy
   between the minutes page and the proceedings page. To resolve this
   ambiguity, the proceedings page takes precedent and the final form of
   meeting minutes must be submitted in ASCII form by the forth Friday
   following the meeting week. For example, in the case of the 59th IETF
   Meeting (March 01, 2004 - March 05, 2004), minutes are required to be
   received by the IETF Secretariat (minutes@ietf.org) by April 02, 2004
   (i.e., the forth Friday following the meeting week).

   Finally, note that draft minutes must not be submitted to
   minutes@ietf.org, and only final versions of session minutes will be
   accepted.



1.6.  Minutes Errata -- Correcting Mistakes


   Corrections to minutes will be accepted until the Friday six weeks
   from the Friday of the meeting week. Such corrections should be sent
   to minutes@ietf.org. In general, the rule can be stated as follows:

     The Working Group Chair can make changes to submitted minutes
     or presentation materials for six weeks from the Friday of
     meeting week; However, the chair must have submitted some form
     of the materials to the IETF Secretariat by the forth Friday
     following the meeting week.

2.  Presentation Materials


   IETF secretariat also maintains a "slides" web page[SLIDES] which
   outlines acceptable encodings (outlined below), and layout guidelines
   for session presentation materials. However, these guidelines are
   (possibly necessarily) vague, and provide no procedures for working
   group chairs to ensure consistent cross-working group presentation
   quality. As a result, IETF session presentation materials are of
   widely varying content and quality. In the following sections we
   outline a standard format for IETF session materials, and a process
   for their submission.

   In general, in order to have presentation materials included in the
   meeting proceedings, an on-line copy set of the slides in an approved
   format, must be submitted within two weeks following the meeting (see
   discussion of formats and deadlines below). Presentation slides
   covering information reported in the minutes need not be submitted.



2.1.  Format: General Layout Guidelines


   [SLIDES] outlines the general layout guidelines for presentation
   materials to be included in IETF proceedings. In particular:

    o Paper size: Letter (all other sizes will be modified to fit)
    o Avoid unnecessary detail in slides, they will be difficult to
      read in the reduced hardcopy version
    o Avoid using color schemes which wash out information when
      printed in black-and-white
    o Landscape layout will be printed 6 horizontal frames per page
      - use at least an 16-point font
    o Portrait layout will be printed 4 vertical frames per page -
      use at least an 14-point font



2.2.  Encoding


   [SLIDES] lays out the accepted presentation formats. In particular,
   the presentation materials must be provided one following encodings
   in order to be accepted for publication in the meeting proceedings:

      File Name                    Encoding
      =============================================

   Many presenters are currently use MagicPoint [MGP] as a presentation
   tool, MagicPoint format documents must be converted to one of the
   above formats for submission to proceedings@ietf.org.



2.3.  Submission Procedure and Deadlines


   While submission of minutes is mandatory, submission of slides is
   optional. Again, there is a discrepancy between the IETF secretariat
   "slides" page[SLIDES] and the proceedings page [PROCEEDINGS]. To
   resolve this ambiguity, the proceedings page takes precedent and the
   final form of meeting presentation set must be submitted in an
   approved form by the forth Friday following the meeting week. For
   example, in the case of the 59th IETF Meeting (March 01, 2004 - March
   05, 2004), presentation materials are required to be received by the
   IETF Secretariat (proceedings@ietf.org) by April 02, 2004 (i.e., the
   forth Friday following the meeting week).

   Presenters must provide presentation materials in one of the
   acceptable formats described above to the working group chair by the
   first Friday following the meeting. This gives the chair or chairs
   time to organize their submission to proceedings@ietf.org. If a
   presenter fails to to provide the working group chair with
   presentation materials in a timely fashion or in standard format, the
   materials may not appear in the meeting proceedings.

   Once the working group chair has received presentation materials, the
   chair must fill out the form on [PROCSUB], and submit it with the
   presentation materials. Hard copies must not be submitted, as they
   will not be used. Finally, slides should not be submitted for the
   proceedings if they contain information included in the minutes.

   Note: The materials must be in electronic form, but the form is pdf
   (not amenable to editing, etc).

2.4.  Presentation Errata -- Correcting Mistakes


   Corrections to minutes will be accepted until the Friday six weeks
   from the Friday of the meeting week. Such corrections should be sent
   to proceedings@ietf.org. In general, the rule can be stated as
   follows:


     The Working Group Chair can make changes to submitted minutes
     or presentation materials for six weeks from the Friday of
     meeting week; However, the chair must have submitted some form
     of the materials to the IETF Secretariat by the forth Friday
     following the meeting week.



3.  Recommendations


   As outlined in Section 1.1 above, minutes serve to "note important
   decisions/consensus reached by email in the minutes of the next
   'live' session, and to summarize briefly the decision-making history
   in the final documents the WG produces."  However, the highly
   variable format, quality and content of the minutes makes this goal
   difficult if not impossible to achieve.

   Since the  purpose of the minutes is to summarize and document the
   history and activity (and in particular, any decision making
   activity) of the live meeting, both for those who could not attend,
   and for archival purposes, they are of critical importance. One
   relatively straight forward way to address this problem is described
   in the next section.



3.1.  Audio-only recordings


   One relatively straight forward way to improve the accuracy and
   completeness of the IETF minutes mechanism is to have, in addition to
   the minutes described above, audio-only recordings of all sessions
   available. Such recordings would not only serve to improve the
   precision of them minutes (alleviating the "collective bad memory"
   problem), but the would also serve the documentary of meeting
   minutes.

   Finally, it is worth noting that the IETF already has this mechanism

   in place. However, it is only used for those sessions that are also
   have video recording.
