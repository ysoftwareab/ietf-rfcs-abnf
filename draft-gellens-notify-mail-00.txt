1.  Introduction
    
    There is a long-standing technique supported by a large number of
    mail servers which allows users to be notified of new mail.  In
    addition to server support, there are a number of clients which
    support this, ranging from full email clients to specialized clients
    whose only purpose is to receive new mail notifications and alert a
    mail client.  This technique is sometimes known as "notify mail"
    (after a shareware client of the same name), sometimes called
    "biff", and sometimes the "finger hack".
    
    
2.  Conventions Used in this Document
    
    In examples, "C:" is used to indicate lines sent by the client, and
    "S:" indicates those sent by the server.  Line breaks within a
    command example are for editorial purposes only.
    
    Examples use the 'example.net' domain.
    
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
    in this document are to be interpreted as defined in [KEYWORDS].
    
    
3.  Simple Mail Notification
    
    The technique is for the server to send the string "nm_notifyuser"
    to the finger port on the IP address for the user who has received
    new mail.

    The IP address to use may be configured, or the server may use the
    IP address that was last used to check mail by the user.  Typically
    this is a per-account configuration option.
    
    To be useful, on the client system a process must be listening to
    the finger port.  When it received the "nm_notifyuser" string, it
    takes a configured action, typically instructing a mail client to
    fetch mail.
    
    Normally, the a TCP connection to the target computer is opened, the
    "nm_notifyuser" string is sent, and the connection is closed without
    waiting for any response.
    
    In some cases UDP is used instead of TCP.
    
    
4.  Security Considerations
    
    There is of course no assurance that in general the "nm_notifyuser"
    message is being sent to the correct IP address.  Nor does the
    listening agent on the client system have any assurance that a
    "nm_notifyuser" string was sent by a mail server which has received
    new mail for the user.  It would be trivial for an attacker to send
    large numbers of "nm_notifyuser" messages to any targeted system.
    Client systems listening for this message SHOULD implement
    protections against being flooded with notifications.  Many server
    systems already implement protections against users logging in and
    checking mail too frequently.
    
    
5.  IANA Considerations
    
    None at this time.
