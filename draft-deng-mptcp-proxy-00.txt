1  Introduction

   Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are challenged by the data
   explosion occurring in their Fixed and/or Mobile networks. This data
   explosion is triggered by new usages with the advent for resource-
   demanding services. The emergence of these services is facilitated by
   the emergence of new access technologies (FTTx in the Fixed or LTE in
   the Mobile networks). Typical resource-demanding services are (HD)
   video streaming or catchup IP-TV which are boosting more and more
   every day the customers appetite for more IP bandwidth. 

   This pressure on continuous increase of network capacity poses a
   challenge on the ISPs to appropriately plan, dimension and
   dynamically provision their networks to satisfy customers
   expectations.  This problem is encountered by both Fixed and Mobile
   Providers that have to cope with the scarcity of the radio frequency
   resources, the limits of the already widely deployed DSL
   infrastructure, or any in-place access technology.

   The traditional trend that consist in upgrading the access technology
   to a new generation technology may show some limits because of the
   required upgrade cycles. Alternate deployment options to satisfy
   customers' expectations and react rapidly to competition are of
   interest of ISPs. A promising track, discussed in this document, is
   to aggregate several connectivity links while eliminating risks to
   experience application failures.

   Indeed, a direction to answer to this problem is to make use of the
   multiple interfaces that one terminal host maintains. For smartphones
   or mobile dongles, these interfaces are typically a 3G/4G radio
   access and a WLAN access, while for a residential CPE these
   interfaces are typically a DSL line and a 3G/4G radio access. 

   3GPP initiated an effort to aggregate several radio resources for the
   sake of increasing bitrates (denoted as Carrier Aggregation (CA)).
   Aggregation is achieved at the radio level by combining the set of
   allocated contiguous or non-contiguous component carriers. This
   extension requires modification at the radio interface level of the
   UE (User Equipment), as well as some tuning on the network side.
   Carrier Aggregation is specific to radio-based environments and, as
   such, it is not convenient for other deployment cases, such as wired
   networks.

   Both 3GPP and IETF standard bodies have investigated different
   solutions to make the best interface used for one application, with
   potential use of multiple interfaces at the same time by
   multitasking-enable terminals. As of today, none of them really did
   meet a wide deployment and successful adoption.

   The IETF released MPTCP specification [RFC6824], an experimental set
   of TCP options allowing the use of parallel TCP connections, each
   with different set of IP addresses and/or port numbers, to serve at
   least one application. MPTCP is already available on some widely
   adopted mobile handsets and on some Linux implementations. However,
   MPTCP connections are pretty rare since the servers hosting the
   applications are too few to offer MPTCP capability.

   Because resources are scarce at the access segment, a solution to
   enhance the quality of experience is to enable MPTCP at the access
   segment without requiring MPTCP support at the server side (i.e., the
   end-to-end MPTCP support is not required). Concretely, this can be
   implemented owing to the deployment a dedicated function called MPTCP
   Proxy at the ISP network side and/or in the CPE device. Note that
   enabling an MPTCP Proxy in the CPE has the advantage to not require
   MPTCP stack at the terminal side.

   By this mean, an ISP can offer a higher bandwidth to its customers
   when possible while not waiting for massive MPTCP adoption by the
   Internet ecosystem. Furthermore, this technique would allow the ISP
   and the customer to control the parts of the networks where potential
   QoE degradation may be experienced and where the traffic can be
   handled appropriately by means of traffic engineering tweaking for
   instance. Since MPTCP requires a load-sharing algorithm to schedule
   the TCP subflow to which the traffic is forwarded, the selection of
   the proper algorithm could help for instance to offload the IP
   traffic towards the legacy Fixed networks while taking advantage of
   the complementary bandwidth only when needed/selected by the
   customers, application, or the ISP.

   Note that the use of MPTCP at customer side can be of different
   natures as defined in MTPCP base specification:

     o Native MPTCP: Two MPTCP endpoints establish and make use of all
   subflows that correspond to the available addresses/port numbers.
   This mode is enabled to optimize data throughput. 

     o Active/Backup MPTCP: Two MPTCP endpoints enable multiple
   subflows, but only a subset of these subflows is actually in use for
   data transfer. MPTCP endpoints can use the MP_PRIO signal to change
   the priority for each subflow.

     o Single subflow MPTCP: Two MPTCP endpoints use one single subflow
   and when a failure is observed, an additional subflow is enabled so
   that traffic is forwarded along the newly established subflow. 

   Based on the basic capabilities of an MPTCP-enabled host, various
   deployment use cases can be considered by an ISP. Examples of such

   use cases include: traffic handover among multiple WLAN hotspots,
   traffic offload from a mobile network to WLAN or vice visa, and
   access link aggregation.

   In general, two flavors of MPTCP Proxy can be envisaged , see Figure
   1:

     o A MPTCP Proxy that relays a UE originated TCP connection into an
   MPTCP connection. An example would be an MPTCP-enabled CPE, which
   makes use of its own multiple local interfaces to maximize the
   experience of bandwidth consuming applications for Non-MPTCP UEs.

     o A MPTCP Proxy that relays an UE originated MPTCP connection into
   a TCP connection. This is the case for most mobile terminals with
   multiple interfaces and built-in MPTCP capability.

2  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document makes use of the following terms: (For definitions of
   other terms such as "(MPTCP) Connection", "Host" and "Subflow", refer
   to [RFC6824].)

   M-session: a MPTCP connection between a M-UE and a M-Server.

   M-Server: a server with MPTCP capability enabled for the current TCP
   session, or simply a serving MPTCP host.  M-Server may be connected
   to the network using one or multiple network interfaces.

   M-UE: a user equipment with MPTCP capability enabled for the current
   TCP session, or simply a requesting MPTCP host. Unless it is
   explicated, an M-UE can be a host or a CPE.

   N-Server: a server without MPTCP capability enabled for the current
   TCP session.

   N-UE: a user equipment without MP-TCP capability enabled for the
   current TCP session.

   MPTCP Proxy: proxy located between a M-UE and a N-Server, which
   enables a M-session with the M-UE and maps it into a legacy TCP
   connection with the N-Server.

   Natural Path: a "natural path" of a subflow is the original path it
   would traverse end-to-end if there is no explicit traffic steering
   function is enabled for MPTCP Proxy.

   Small Cell: generally refers to the cells with less than 1 watt
   output power, e.g. picocell, femtocell, etc.

   Nanocell: a type of base station integrated with both a small cell
   and a WLAN access point.


3 Use-cases for ISP MPTCP Proxy

3.1 Boosting MPTCP Utilization for M-UEs and Multi-Interface CPEs

   On the one hand, user equipment (esp. mobile terminals) nowadays have
   multiple interfaces and could benefit from these interfaces if they
   were using MPTCP. 

   On the other hand, servers often only support regular TCP and
   upgrading them to support MPTCP will take more time than on the
   clients.

   Therefore, it is expected that an ISP deployed MPTCP Proxy would
   benefit the M-UEs with better user-experience for almost all the
   legacy applications by exploiting MPTCP capability at least for the
   most resource-limited channel on the air, without relying on
   pervasive MPTCP deployment at the server side.

   The same approach can be followed for CPE-based deployment models.
   These models can be refreshed to integrate CPEs that are able to
   mount multiple interfaces.

3.2 Resource Pooling from Multiple Networks
 


<Deng, et al.>         Expires December 29, 2014                [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT  <MPTCP Proxy Usecases and Requirements>     May 29, 2014


   For an ISP providing multiple access networks to its subscribers, a
   locally deployed MPTCP Proxy would enable use-cases where the M-
   UE/ISP is trying to pool access network resources from multiple
   networks concurrently, e.g., among multiple WLAN hotspots, a fixed
   and a WLAN connection, a cellular and a WLAN, a cellular and a Fixed
   access, etc.

   However, the specific pooling strategy can differ for various
   scenarios, depending on the type of subscriber and the current status
   of different networks, etc. 

   For example, from the user's perspective, business customers would
   have perfect pooling while other users would get the cheaper network
   whenever possible. 

   On the other hand, from the ISP's perspective, it would encourage
   more efficient usage of network resource by dynamic charging policy
   for rush hours, has a static preference for a specific network over
   another one, or even desires traffic offloading to proactively
   migrate less sensitive or more demanding traffic between multiple
   networks it controls.

   Criteria to invoke an MPTCP Proxy in a communication paths will be
   the results of these policies (i.e., subscribers, applications, and
   ISPs).

3.3 Multiple Connections and Seamless Handover between Multiple Networks

   For cellular ISPs, the radio access networks are the dominating part
   of their network construction investment. With the rapid development
   of cellular technology and the imbalance of subscriber/traffic
   distribution geographically, it is common practice to deploy leading-
   edge technology in traffic boosting hot spots (e.g., downtown areas
   in big cities) first while enabling seamless handover for legacy
   cellular/wireless networks to guarantee service continuity for a
   moving terminal. 

   A device can discover multiple networks, including multiple
   attachment points to the same ISPs. This is the typical example of a
   device that can be serviced with multiple WLAN hotspots. Instead of
   selecting only one attachment point, the device can select multiple
   ones when more resources are required. Maintaining simultaneous
   attachment to these attachment points will also allow for seamless
   handover and, therefore, allow for session continuity. 

   Implementing this feature may require an explicit signal to the
   connecting device to drive its network attachment procedure. It is
   out of scope of this document to discuss such signals nor elaborate

   on potential impact on battery consumption on mobile devices mounting
   multiple interfaces in parallel.

3.4 Assist MTPCP Connection Establishment

   The MPTCP Proxy does not know in advance whether a remote server is
   MPTCP-enabled. As such, the MPTCP Proxy can be provided with various
   policies such as (but not limited to):

   o Strip any MPTCP signal systematically when relaying TCP messages to
   a remote server: This mode assumes servers are not widely MPTCP-
   enabled. It has the advantage to not suffer from MPTCP fallback delay
   when the remote server is not MPTCP-enabled.

   o Allow MPTCP signals to be passed to systematically to remote
   servers: This mode has the advantage to optimize MPTCP Proxy
   resources and favor direct communications between an MPTCP-enabled UE
   and an MTPCP-enabled server without invoking the MPTCP Proxy when
   both the server and client are MPTCP-enabled.

4 Deployment Considerations

   For a MPTCP Proxy to correctly manage a M-session with the M-UE, it
   is necessary for it to receive each subflow coming from the M-UE and
   heading for the N-Server it is acting on behalf of. It is hence
   straightforward to consider an on-path deployment strategy, where the
   MPTCP Proxy is directly located on the common link of every subflow
   from the M-UE. 

   However, for other cases where a common link is absent within the
   local ISP's domain or resource pooling is desired from networks of
   different ISP domains, the MPTCP Proxy has to steer off-path subflow
   to traverse the selected MPTCP Proxy explicitly. Note that steering
   functions should work for both directions over all the subflows, i.e.
   including both uplink and downlink traffic from/to the M-UE.

   Therefore, two types of MPTCP Proxy are considered in this document:
   on-path MPTCP Proxy and off-path MPTCP Proxy.

4.1 On-path MPTCP Proxy


   For different access networks provided by a single ISP, it is fairly
   easy to locate a common link and deploy an on-path MPTCP Proxy
   accordingly.

   As depicted in Figure 2, the on-path MPTCP Proxy is located on each
   potential path from a M-UE for both MPTCP traffic and legacy TCP

4.2 Off-Path Proxy

   On the one hand, it is not viable to assume for instance a common
   link from a cellular ISP to deploy an on-path proxy on each potential
   MPTCP subflow originating from its M-UE via third-party WLAN networks
   for instance. 

   On the other hand, even for resource pooling from a single ISP's own
   WLAN networks, it is not always feasible to find such a common link
   for on-path MPTCP Proxy before corresponding traffic hitting the
   public Internet.

   As depicted in Figure 3, the off-path MPTCP Proxy is located on the
   "natural path" of only a partial subset of potential subflow of a
   given M-session, and relies on extra mechanism to explicitly steering
   other subflows to deviate from their "natural path" and go through
   it.

5 Deployment Scenarios

5.1 MPTCP Proxy at the ISP IP Gateway

   For Fixed networks, MPTCP Proxy can be located in various segments
   with a network (e.g., co-located with a CGN [RFC6888], a DS-Lite AFTR
   [RFC6333], or a NAT64 device [RFC6146] if already present in the
   network, co-located with a TCP acceleration and optimizer if any,
   etc.).

   As the anchoring point for 3GPP mobile UE originated IP traffic
   within the cellular network, the IP gateway of 3GPP network (e.g.,
   GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node) or PDN Gateway (PGW) [RFC7066])
   would be a natural spot for MPTCP Proxy deployment. It is also
   possible for the gateway to reuse existing interfaces with other 3GPP
   network elements for information/policy acquisition. Alternatively,
   another location for MPTCP Proxy deployment would be the (s)Gi
   Interface(i.e., between the GGSN/PGW and an external PDN (Packet
   Domain Network)).

5.2 On-Path MPTCP Proxy at the ISP Data Center

   It is common practice for local ISPs to build up local data center
   facilities within its domain for large Internet content providers in
   order to feed user's requests locally, resulting in both enhanced
   user experience for cut-short end-to-end delay and reduced expenses
   for unnecessary cross-ISP peering traffic.

   It is believed that by deploying an on-path MPTCP Proxy at the
   entrance of the ISP's local data center, it would help various
   Internet Content Provider residing within the data center to gain
   enhanced user-experience for local subscribers with M-UEs without the
   need to upgrade their servers manually.

5.3 On-Path MPTCP Proxy at Nanocell

   Nanocell is a box integrating small cell (low-powered radio access
   nodes) and carrier WLAN. Nanocell is expected to be a cost-effective
   and green way for cellular network deployment for both home and
   enterprise subscribers. For instance, it can be integrated with the
   home gateway for a broadband subscriber.

   Figure 4. Nanocell System Architecture

   As a combined access node for both cellular and WLAN traffic,
   nanocell represents a spot for an on-path MPTCP Proxy. 

   Note that by applying local breakout scheme, where the small cell
   doing IP-layer forwarding itself rather than relying on other 3GPP
   routing devices, it is expected that no extensions to existing 3GPP
   specs are needed for its integration with an MPTCP Proxy.

5.4 MPTCP Proxy at CPE/CGN for Fixed Access Networks

   A first deployment model assumes MPTCP Proxy is enabled in a CPE.
   This proxy aims to offer MPTCP service to non-MPTCP hosts located
   behind the CPE. This model can be deployed with or without an MPTCP
   Proxy at the ISP's network. 

   In early deployment stages, this model is likely to require an MPTCP
   Proxy be also deployed at the ISP's network side. This is mainly to
   shorten delays induced by TCP fall back when the remote server is not
   MPTCP compliant.

   Hosts located behind the CPE are not aware of the activation of the
   MPTCP at the CPE side. MPTCP can be used for both bandwidth
   aggregation and also ensure session continuity during failure
   events.


6  Requirements for MPTCP Proxy

   This section identifies requirements derived from the above use-cases
   for an ISP MPTCP Proxy.

6.1  Protocol Proxying between MPTCP and TCP

   In the on-path MPTCP Proxy use-case, the proxy is assured to be
   deployed on the path of each potential subflow of a given MPTCP
   session from the M-UE to the N-Server. 

 


<Deng, et al.>         Expires December 29, 2014               [Page 11]

INTERNET DRAFT  <MPTCP Proxy Usecases and Requirements>     May 29, 2014


   To allow a MPCTP-enabled UE to make full use of the multiple
   interfaces even if it is interacting with an N-server, the on-path
   MPTCP Proxy MUST satisfy the following requirements.

   (a) Compatibility: An on-path MPTCP Proxy supports detection of M-
   UE/N-server combinations for further proxying while leaving M-UE/M-
   server and N-UE/N-server sessions intact.

   (b) Transparency: An on-path MPTCP Proxy supports negotiation with
   and acting towards the M-UE like a M-server on behalf of N-Server,
   while acting towards the N-Server like a N-UE on behalf of the M-UE.

6.2  Explicit Traffic Steering for Off-Path Proxying

   As we discussed earlier in the off-path MPTCP Proxy use-case, it is
   required that subflows whose "natural path" does not include the
   MPTCP Proxy be redirected explicitly to go through the proxy.

   (c) Explicit Traffic Steering: an off-path MPTCP Proxy that enables
   resource pooling from third-party WLAN networks MUST support explicit
   traffic steering, to allow all the subsequent subflow traffic go
   through the exactly the same MPTCP Proxy used in the correspondent M-
   session establishment for both directions (including uplink and
   downlink traffic from/to the M-UE).

   (d) Globally Routable Address: an off-path MPTCP Proxy that enables
   resource pooling from the same ISP's networks SHOULD expose a
   globally routable address to allow explicit steering of subsequent
   subflow traffic after they hit the public Internet.

6.3  Flexible Resource Policy within a Single ISP

   Different from the end-to-end MPTCP solution, ISP deployed MPTCP
   Proxy is a potential point for centralized cross-network flow control
   over service/RAT preference for a given subscriber's M-UEs, which is
   considered to be essential for better operation and service provision
   in 3GPP networks.

   However, to enable such fine-grained resource pooling policy from the
   network side, it is essential that the MPTCP proxy knows for each
   subflow its specific Network Access Type information. 

   (e) Network Access Type Information: an MPTCP proxy SHOULD be able to
   make use of a reliable information sharing/reporting mechanism to
   acquire a subflow's Network Access Type information/update on a real-
   time basis.

   (f) Resource Policy: an MPTCP Proxy MUST support flexible control to

INTERNET DRAFT  <MPTCP Proxy Usecases and Requirements>     May 29, 2014


   set limits to both the number of concurrent subflows running in a M-
   session and the number of concurrent M-sessions from an M-UE/to an N-
   Server, according to the type and/or identity of relevant subscriber
   and/or application.

6.4 Protection against third-party traffic

   Apart from the traditional private network deployment practice, an
   off-path MPTCP proxy exposes itself as publicly accessible from any
   third-party traffic, where traditional access authorization or
   admission control mechanisms from 3GPP network would not work. It is
   therefore envisioned that an off-path MPTCP Proxy open for third-
   party WiFi resource pooling MUST support minimal protection/policy
   against potentially malicious traffic from third-party network.

   (g) Provision Negotiation: an MPTCP Proxy SHOULD support both
   subscriber/M-session/subflow level resource reservation negotiation
   with a M-UE.

   (h) Origin Authentication: an off-path MPTCP Proxy MUST support
   subflow authentication for traffic from an unauthorized third-party
   WiFi, in order to serve subflows belong to its intended M-sessions
   coming from authorized subscribers or NAT, while turning down others
   with least overhead.

   (i) Admission Control: an off-path MPTCP Proxy MUST support admission
   control to set limits to both the number of concurrent subflows on a
   given M-session and the number of concurrent M-sessions for a given
   subscriber/application.

6.5 MPTCP Proxy Selection from Multiple Candidates

   When multiple MPTCP Proxies exist on an end-to-end path from the M-UE
   to the N-Server, a natural question arises that "which MPTCP Proxy
   should be chosen and how". There may be different considerations
   depending on the location and types of MPTCP Proxy involved in
   addition to the expectation of the application.

   For example, assume an ISP deploys on-path MPTCP Proxy at nanocell as
   well as an off-path MPTCP Proxy at the IP gateway of its cellular
   network. The following considerations may apply.

   On one hand, a straightforward policy would be to choose the nearest
   MPTCP Proxy to the M-UE, i.e. the on-path MPTCP Proxy at nanocell
   which would lead to more efficiency from less traffic convergence
   pressure. Another policy would be to prefer the on-path MPTCP Proxy
   to the off-path one, which would cause unnecessary traffic
   roundabout.

INTERNET DRAFT  <MPTCP Proxy Usecases and Requirements>     May 29, 2014


   However, on the other hand, if a M-session is established with the
   on-path MPTCP Proxy at nanocell and when the M-UE moves out of the
   coverage of the cell, the connection will be broken. Therefore, it is
   reasonable to choose off-path MPTCP Proxy for applications with
   strict service continuity expectations, while favor on-path MPTCP
   Proxy for bulk data transfer with application-level re-connection
   mechanisms.

   In summary, regarding the MPTCP Proxy selection from multiple
   candidates, the following requirement apply. 

   (j) Flexible Selection: when multiple M-Proxies are deployed on the
   end-to-end path for a M-session establishment within the domain a
   single ISP, it SHOULD be possible for the ISP to enforce flexible
   selection policy regarding which MPTCP Proxy to serve which M-
   session, based on the MPTCP Proxy's location, the MPTCP Proxy's type
   (on-path/off-path) in addition to the application's expectation.

6.6 Load Balancing Algorithm for Multiple Networks

   When multiple networks are available to service a subscriber, the
   traffic may be balanced among those available paths for the sake of
   QoE. The logic for balancing the traffic among those multiple paths
   can be driven by application needs, customer's preferences, and/or
   ISP traffic engineering guidelines. 

   From a traffic engineering perspective, the ISP may enforce policies
   that would optimize various parameters such as:

   o Network resources usage as a whole.

   o Optimized invocation of available MPTCP Proxies (i.e., MPTCP Proxy
   selection).

   o Optimized MPTCP Proxy local performances (e.g., avoid overload
   phenomena).

   o Enhanced QoE (including increase both upstream and downstream
   throughputs)

   In summary, regarding the load balancing algorithm for multiple
   networks, the following requirement apply.

   (k) The MPTCP Proxy SHOULD be configurable with the load balancing
   ratio per each available path.

6.7 Misc

INTERNET DRAFT  <MPTCP Proxy Usecases and Requirements>     May 29, 2014


   Below are listed some additional requirements:

   o Including an MPTCP Proxy in the communication may be seen as a
   single point of failure. Means to protect against such failures
   should be enabled.

   o If TCP flows handled by the MPTCP Proxy are sourced with the
   external IP address(es) that belong to the MPTCP Proxy, all hosts
   serviced by the same MPTCP Proxy will be seen with the same IP
   address(es). Means to mitigate the side effects documented in
   [RFC6269] SHOULD be enabled in such deployment case.  

   o The MPTCP Proxy SHOULD NOT alter non-MPTCP signals included in a
   TCP segment.

   o The MPTCP Proxy MUST NOT inject MPTCP signals if the TCP option
   size is consumed.

   o The MPTCP Proxy SHOULD NOT inject MPTCP signals if this leads to
   local fragmentation. MTU tuning may be required to avoid
   fragmentation. MPTCP Proxy SHOULD be configurable to enable/disable
   this feature.

   o The MPTCP Proxy MUST take proper measure to avoid errors caused by
   careless MPTCP signal modification to segments with other TCP
   options. For instance, TCP-AO (TCP Authentication Option) [RFC5925],
   which includes TCP options in the MAC computation, when present, MUST
   be the first processed by the MPTCP Proxy.

   o The MPTCP Proxy SHOULD be easy to scale to cope with growing
   demand.    

7  Security Considerations

   As an MPTCP Proxy is playing N-UE and M-Server at the same time, the
   security considerations that concerns a TCP client and a MPTCP-
   enabled server are applicable to a MPTCP Proxy in general [RFC6181].

   Forcing the traffic to cross an MPTCP Proxy that would not be
   involved if legacy routing and forwarding actions are enforced raises
   some security concerns. In particular, inserting an illegitimate
   MPTCP Proxy can be used to hijack connections. Traffic inspected by
   third party MPTCP Proxy may be used as a vector to reveal privacy-
   related information. 

   These security concerns can be mitigated if the MPTCP Proxy is
   managed by the same ISP offering connectivity to a customer.
   Otherwise, specific mechanisms to be used are expected to be an
