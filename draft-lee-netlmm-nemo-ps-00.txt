Abstract

   The NetLMM protocol provides local mobility to the mobile node
   without requiring any modification of mobile node.  The NetLMM domain
   provides this service by maintaining forwarding state for the mobile
   node's prefix.  In case that the mobile node is a mobile router in
   the home network the NetLMM domain may not have the forwarding state
   for the mobile network prefix, so it can't forward packets from nodes
   within the mobile network, that is to say, existing NetLMM protocols
   do not consider mobile routers enough.

2.  Introduction

   The NetLMM (Network-based Localized Mobility Management) protocol
   provides local mobility to the mobile nodes without requiring any
   involvement of a mobile node stack.  From the perspective of the
   mobile node, the entire NetLMM domain appears as a single link, the
   network ensures the mobile node believes it is always on its home
   link.  So the mobile node in a NetLMM domain may operate as if it
   were still in the same subnet while it is moving in the NetLMM
   domain.

   The NetLMM protocol has two principal functional entities, which are
   called MAG (Mobile Access Gateway) and LMA (Local Mobility Anchor).
   The LMA maintains a collection of routes for individual mobile nodes
   while the mobile nodes moves around in the NetLMM domain.  The route
   information that the LMA keeps is, however, only for the packets
   based on the subnet prefix allocated to the mobile node itself.

   So if a mobile router (MR) implementing the NEMO protocol [RFC3963]
   joins the NetLMM domain as a home network and moves around among MAGs
   in the NetLMM domain, the MAG may not know how to handle the packets
   from nodes attached to the mobile router.

3.  Terminology

   Localized Mobility Management Protocol

         Same as defined in [netlmm-ps].

   NetLMM protocol

         This term does not mean "NetLMM design team protocol" but
         assumes a network-based localized mobility management protocol
         that supports the NetLMM functional architecture described in
         [netlmm-goals].  So this term includes "netlmm dt protocol" and
         "proxy MIPv6 protocol".

   NetLMM domain

         This term is defined in [netlmm-dt-protocol] but the meaning of
         "the NetLMM protocol" follows the term "NetLMM protocol"
         previously defined.

4.  Assumptions

   In general, the localized/global mobility management scheme follows
   the assumptions below, which this draft is based on.

4.1.  The Granularity of Mobility Management

   Mobility management is broken down into localized mobility management
   and global mobility management.  Local mobility involves movements
   across some administratively and geographically contiguous set of
   subnets.  The mobile node that implements a global mobility protocol
   moves across broader administrative, geographical, and topological
   domains and these domains could be localized mobility management
   domain or not.

4.2.  The Requirements for NetLMM protocol

   o  The NetLMM protocol should be able to support unmodified mobile
      nodes (goal #7 of [netlmm-goals]).  In this goal the mobile node
      can be a normal host or a node that has some kind of global
      mobility protocol.

   o  Localized mobility management is independent of global mobility
      management (goal #10 of [netlmm-goals]).  This goal says that the
      implementation and deployment of the localized mobility management
      protocol should not restrict, or be restricted by, the choice of
      global mobility management protocol.  This means that the mobile
      node which has a global mobility protocol can move freely across
      NetLMM domains or any ordinary subnet; and from the mobile node's
      point of view both appear as the same, that is to say, single
      subnet.  In other words, the mobile node does not know and does
      not need to know whether the domain that it just entered is a
      NetLMM domain or not

4.3.  NetLMM protocol

   Currently there are two NetLMM protocol candidates; the design team
   protocol and the proxy mobile IPv6 protocol [netlmm-pmipv6].  This
   draft considers both of them.

5.  Problem Statement for NEMO in NetLMM domain

   [netlmm-goals] describes the goals (or requirements) for NetLMM.
   Section 3.7 "Support for Unmodified Mobile Nodes (Goal #7)" of
   [netlmm-goals] says that the NetLMM solution should be able to
   support any mobile node without requiring localized mobility
   management software on the mobile node.  In this context, the mobile
   node can be an ordinary host or a node that has some kind of global
   mobility protocol.

   Since the entire NetLMM domain appears as a single link to the mobile
   node, the mobile node that has a global mobility protocol will not
   trigger the global mobility protocol while moving into (or inside of)
   the NetLMM domain.  In this situation most of the mobile nodes that
   have a host-based global mobility protocol may work well, but if the
   mobile node is a mobile router that implements NEMO protocol there
   may be problems in forwarding packets from the nodes attached to the
   mobile router.

   The NetLMM protocol has two principal functional entities, which are
   called MAG (Mobile Access Gateway) and LMA (Local Mobility Anchor).
   The LMA maintains a collection of routes for individual mobile nodes
   and it will be used while the mobile node moves around in the NetLMM
   domain.  The route information that the LMA keeps is, however, only
   for the packets based on the subnet prefix allocated to the mobile
   node itself.  Thus, if a mobile router joins the NetLMM domain as a
   home network and moves around among MAGs that belong to the NetLMM
   domain a MAG may not know how to handle the packets from nodes
   attached to the mobile router because there is no way to inform the
   MAG and LMA of the mobile network prefix.

   If the mobile router boots up in a normal access network and then
   moves into a NetLMM domain this problem does not occur because in the
   foreign network the mobile router will make a tunnel to the home
   agent and forward all packets from its mobile network through this
   tunnel to the home agent.  In this case the source address of packet
   is the CoA of the mobile router and the MAG that the mobile router is
   attached to can handle this packet.

   So, This problem statement might have an impact on the NetLMM
   protocol specification itself.

6.  Packet Forwarding Scenario for NEMO in NetLMM domain

   We consider two scenarios in that a mobile router joins NetLMM
   domain.

6.1.  Mobile Router is "at home"

   The MR will obtain a prefix by attaching to the NetLMM domain.  But
   all the nodes within the mobile network attached to the MR will keep
   their prefix.  Because the MR is "at home", it will not encapsulate
   packets from attached nodes, but forward them to a MAG.  The MAG only
   knows the prefix of the MR, but not the prefix of any attached node.
   This situation might cause the combination of NEMO and NetLMM to
   fail.

6.2.  Mobile Router is "away"

   The MR will also receive a prefix during NetLMM domain attachment.
   But the NEMO protocol which is implemented at the MR will encapsulate
   packets from nodes attached to the MR.  Therefore, the mobile network
   will appear to the MAG as if it is a single node.  It is assumed that
   in this case, no problems will occur.
