1.  Introduction

   Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV) [ETSI-NFV-WHITE] offers a new
   way to design, deploy and manage network services.  The network
   service can be composed of one or more network functions and NFV
   relocates the network functions from dedicated hardware appliances to
   generic servers, so they can run in software.  Using these
   virtualized network functions (VNFs), the network service can be
   described by a service chain (or VNF forwarding graph; VNF-FG) which
   defines an ordered sequence of VNFs for the composed service.  The
   VNF-FG can be instantiated by creating or selecting VNF instances and
   virtual links (VLs) among them, which results in a network forwarding
   path (NFP).

   The performance or state of the NFP depends on the ones of VNF
   instances and underlying NFVI resources.  For example, if one of the
   VNF instances in a NFP gets failed, the whole network service using
   the NFP also gets failed.  Thus, the VNF instances per NFP need to be
   carefully selected at VNF-FG instantiation or dynamically replaced by
   other VNF instances at run-time for better performance and
   resilience.

   This document specifies problem definition and use cases for dynamic
   service chain adaptation for traffic optimization, failover, load
   balancing, etc.  It further describes design considerations and

   relevant framework for the resource management capability that
   dynamically creates and updates NFPs considering resource state of
   VNF instances.

   This document mainly focuses on the resource capability in the ETSI
   NFV framework [ETSI-NFV-ARCH] but also studies its applicability to
   the control plane of SFC architecture [I-D.ietf-sfc-architecture].


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms and most of them were
   reproduced from [ETSI-NFV-TERM].

   o  Network Functions (NF): A functional building block within a
      network infrastructure, which has well-defined external interfaces
      and a well-defined functional behavior.

   o  Network service: A composition of network functions and defined by
      its functional and behavioural specification.

   o  NFV Framework: The totality of all entities, reference points,
      information models and other constructs defined by the
      specifications published by the ETSI ISG NFV.

   o  Virtualised Network Function (VNF): An implementation of an NF
      that can be deployed on a Network Function Virtualisation
      Infrastructure (NFVI).

   o  NFV Infrastructure (NFVI): The NFV-Infrastructure is the totality
      of all hardware and software components which build up the
      environment in which VNFs are deployed.

   o  NF Forwarding Graph: A graph of logical links connecting NF nodes
      for the purpose of describing traffic flow between these network
      functions.

   o  VNF Forwarding Graph (VNF-FG): A NF forwarding graph where at
      least one node is a VNF.

   o  Virtual Link: A set of connection points along with the
      connectivity relationship between them and any associated target
      performance metrics (e.g. bandwidth, latency, QoS).  The Virtual
      Link can interconnect two or more entities (VNF components, VNFs,
      or PNFs).

   o  Scaling: Ability to dynamically extend/reduce resources granted to
      the Virtual Network Function (VNF) as needed.

3.  Dynamic service chain adaptation

   The goal of dynamic service chain adaptation is to optimize the
   performance of network services.  To meet this goal, NFPs of the
   network services need to consider the state of NFV resources (such as
   VNF instances or virtual links) at construction.  The NFPs also need
   to dynamically adapt to the changes of the resource state at run-
   time, such as availability, load, and topological locations of VNF
   instances.  The adaptation of NFPs can be executed by monitoring the
   resource state of VNF instances and VLs and replacing the original
   VNF instances of the NFP with new VNF instances that constitute a NFP
   with better performance.  This functionality can be a part of
   Orchestrator functional building block in the NFV framework
   [ETSI-NFV-MANO] but it needs further study.

3.1.  Use cases

   There are several use cases of dynamic service chain adaptation:
   fail-over, end-to-end service optimization, traffic optimization,
   load balancing, energy efficiency, and so on.

   Fail-over

   When one of VNF instances in a NFP gets failed to run due to failure
   of its VM or underlying network, the whole chain of network service
   also gets failed.  For service continuity, the failure of VNF
   instance needs to be detected and the failed one needs to be replaced
   with the other one which is available to use.  Figure 1 presents an
   example of the fail-over use case.  A network service is defined as a
   chain of VNF-A and VNF-B; and the service chain is instantiated with
   VNF-A1 and VNF-B1 which are instances of VNF-A and VNF-B
   respectively.  In the meantime, failure of VNF-B1 is detected so that
   VNF-B2 replaces the failed one for fail-over of the NFP.

   ### NFP


                      Figure 1: A fail-over use case

   End-to-end service optimization

   Traffic for a network service traverses all of the VNF instances
   given by a NFP before reaching a target end point.  Thus, stretch of
   the traffic route along a NFP may vary according to topological
   locations of VNF instances and such stretch needs to be kept low to
   make topological distance of two end points of the network service
   short.  This stretch can be managed by constructing or adapting the
   NFP considering topological locations of the VNF instances.

   Traffic optimization

   A network operator may provide multiple network services with
   different VNF-FGs and different flows of traffic traverse between
   source and destination end-points along the VNF-FGs.  For efficiency
   of network management resource usage, the NFPs need to be built as to
   localize the traffic flows or as to avoid bottleneck links shared by
   multiple traffic flows.  In this case, multiple NFV instances of
   different NFPs need to be considered together at constructing a new
   NFP or adapting one.

   Load balancing

   A single VNF instances may be shared by multiple traffic flows of the
   same of different network services.  In order to avoid bottleneck
   points due to overloaded NFV instances, NFPs need to be constructed
   or maintained to distribute workloads of the shared VNF instances.

   Energy efficiency

Internet-Draft    Resource Management for Service Chain     October 2014


   Energy efficiency in the network is getting important to reduce
   impact on the environment so that energy consumption of VNF instances
   using VNFI resources (e.g., compute, storage, I/O) needs to be
   considered at NFP construction or adaptation.  For example, a NFP can
   be constructed as to make traffic flows aggregated into a limited
   number of VNF instances as much as its performance is preserved in a
   certain level.

3.2.  Design considerations

   To support the aforementioned use cases, it is required to support
   resource management capability which provides service chain (or NFP)
   construction and adaptation by considering resource state or
   attributes of VNF instances and virtual links among them.  The
   resource management operations for service chain construction and
   adaptation can be divided into several sub-actions:

   o  Select a VNF instance

   o  Evaluate a VNF instance and a virtual link

   o  Replace a VNF instance to update a NFP

   o  Monitor attributes of a VNF instance and a virtual link

   o  Migrate a VNF instance to a different topological location

   Note: While scaling-in/out or -up/down of VNF instances is an
   essential action for NFV resource management, sub-actions with
   scaling for service chain adaptation are still under study.

   As listed above, VNF instances are selected or replaced according to
   monitoring or evaluation results of performance metrics of the VNF
   instances and virtual links.  Studies about evaluation methodologies
   and performance metrics for VNF instances and NFVI resources can be
   found at [ETSI-NFV-PER001] [I-D.liu-bmwg-virtual-network-benchmark]
   [I-D.morton-bmwg-virtual-net].  The performance metrics of VNF
   instances and virtual links specific to service chain construction
   and adaptation can be defined as follows:

   o  availability (or failure) of a VNF instance and a virtual link

   o  a topological location of a VNF instance

   o  a utilization rate of a VNF instance

   o  a throughput of a VNF instance

   o  energy consumption of VNF instance

   o  bandwidth of a virtual link

   o  latency of a virtual link

3.3.  Framework

   The resource management functionality for dynamic service chain
   adaptation takes role of NFV orchestration with support of VNF
   manager and Virtualised Infrastructure Manager (VIM) in the NFV
   framework [ETSI-NFV-ARCH].  Detailed functional building block and
   interfaces are still under study.

4.  Related works in IETF SFC WG

   IETF SFC WG provides a new service deployment model that delivers the
   traffic along the predefined logical paths of service functions
   (SFs), called service function chains (SFCs) with no regard of
   network topologies or transport mechanisms.  Basic concept of the
   service function chaining is similar to VNF-FG where a network
   service is composed of SFs and deployed by making traffic flows
   traversed instances of the SFs in a pre-defined order.

   There are several works in progress in IETF SFC WG for resource
   management of service chaining.  [I-D.ietf-sfc-architecture] defines
   SFC control plane that selects specific SFs for a requested SFC,
   either statically or dynamically but details are currently outside
   the scope of the document.  There are other works
   [I-D.ww-sfc-control-plane] [I-D.lee-sfc-dynamic-instantiation]
   [I-D.krishnan-sfc-oam-req-framework] [I-D.aldrin-sfc-oam-framework]
   which define the control plane functionality for service function
   chain construction and adaptation but details are still under study.
   While [I-D.dunbar-sfc-fun-instances-restoration] and
   [I-D.meng-sfc-chain-redundancy] provide detailed mechanisms of
   service chain adaptation, they focus only on resilience or fail-over
   of service function chains.
