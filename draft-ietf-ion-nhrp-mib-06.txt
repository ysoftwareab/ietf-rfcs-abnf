1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for the Next Hop
   Resolution Protocol (NHRP) as defined in RFC 2332 [16].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [20].


2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
        called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC
        1904 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
        called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
        The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
        described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
        and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
        [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically

   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.


3.  Structure of the MIB

   The NHRP MIB contains three groups: the General Group, the Client
   Group, and the Server Group.


3.1.  The NHRP General Group

   The General Group contains objects that apply to both clients and
   servers -- in particular the nhrpNextIndex scalar object,  the NHRP
   Next Hop Resolution Cache Table and the NHRP Purge Request Table.

   The nhrpNextIndex scalar object is used to provide unique indices for
   the nhprClientIndex in the nhrpClientTable and the nhrpServerIndex in
   the nhrpServerTable.  If used, this object should reduce or eliminate
   multiple managers creating rows simultaneously in the same table.


3.1.1.  The NHRP Next Hop Resolution Cache Table

   The NHRP Next Hop Resolution Cache Table represents the internetwork
   layer address to NBMA address cache that is maintained by both NHRP
   clients and NHRP servers.

   The NHRP Next Hop Resolution Cache Table contains an ifIndex as part
   of the Index Clause.  This ifIndex represents the use of a generic
   ifIndex, such that the value of this ifIndex SHOULD reflect a
   specific NBMA subnetwork related interface as determined by an
   implementation. For example, assuming that the NBMA subnetwork is
   ATM, then it is up to the implementors of this MIB to determine their
   own ATM interface layering (assuming compliance with the IF-MIB, RFC
   2233 [17] and the ATM-MIB, RFC 2515 [18].  In other words, assuming
   that the NBMA subnetwork is ATM, the ifIndex in the NHRP Cache Table
   would represent the ifIndex containing or consisting of the VC (or
   shortcut) denoted by this Table entry.


3.1.2.  The NHRP Purge Request Table

   The NHRP Purge Request Table is a way to track Purge Request
   Information.

3.2.  The NHRP Client Group

   The Client Group contains objects that only apply to NHRP clients
   (NHCs).


3.2.1.  The NHRP Client Table

   The NHRP Client Table contains entries for NHRP Next Hop Clients
   (NHCs) associated with this agent.  Each row in the table represents
   a single NHC.  The RequestID used in Registration requests needs to
   be saved to non-volatile storage.  Depending upon the implementation,
   this may or may not impact how the StorageType is used.  For a
   complete description of how the Registration RequestID is used, see
   Section 5.2.3 of [16].


3.2.2.  The NHRP Client Registration Table

   The NHRP Client Registration Table contains information on
   registration requests which need to be maintained by the Clients.
   Each entry in this table represents a single registration request.
   Note:  since the NHRP specification does not mandate a refresh
   algorithm, this table omits refresh information, however, this table
   does contain information for all the registration requests which need
   to be maintained by the NHRP Clients.


3.2.3.  The NHRP Client NHS Table

   The NHRP Client NHS Table contains the NBMA subnetwork addresses of
   servers configured for use by the client.  By default, the agent will
   add an entry to this table which corresponds to the client's default
   router.


3.2.4.  The NHRP Client Statistics Table

   The NHRP Client Statistics Table contains NHRP statistics maintained
   by a client.  These statistics include counters on requests and
   replies, as well as counters for errors which are encountered by the
   Clients.


3.3.  The NHRP Server Group

   The Server Group contains objects that only apply to NHRP servers
   (NHSes).

3.3.1.  The NHRP Server Table

   The NHRP Server Table contains entries for each server associated
   with this agent.


3.3.2.  The NHRP Server Next Hop Resolution Cache Table

   The NHRP Server Next Hop Resolution Cache Table contains additional
   objects that a server keeps for each entry in its cache. This table
   extends the NHRP Next Hop Resolution Cache Table defined in the
   General Group.


3.3.3.  The NHRP Server NHC Table

   This table contains information about all the Clients known to the
   Servers.


3.3.4.  The NHRP Server Statistics Table

   The NHRP Server Statistics Table contains NHRP statistics maintained
   by a server.  These statistics include counters on requests and
   replies, as well as counters for errors which are encountered by the
   Servers.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has been and continues
   to be responsible for maintaining the ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS
   (http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/address-family-numbers)
   name space assignments. The request made here is for the IANA to
   place this list in a MIB module, such that it may be imported into
   other MIBs.  The motivation for doing this is to allow MIBs to not
   have to change when a new assignment is made to the ADDRESS FAMILY
   NUMBERS.  This is very similar to the motivation behind the
   IANAifType-MIB.

   An example of what the MIB would look like is included in this
   document.

   Any additions or changes to the list of ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS
   registered via IANA will be done as they have in the past and this
   document does not propose any changes to the ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS
   other than to place them into a MIB, of which an example is given in
   this document (see IANA Address Family Numbers MIB).


6.  Security

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   The NHRP Protocol, RFC 2332 [16], Section 5.2.4.4 discusses security.
   There is an authentication option which should be utilized to
   authenticate the source and also provide data integrity to the NHRP
   payload.  This MIB does not contain any managed objects which
   configure or expose security information such as that needed for NHRP
   authentication or data integrity.

   The following items were deemed to jeopardize security and thus, were
   NOT added to this MIB. Items denoted as (configurable) are those
   which would need values.  Items denoted as (read-only) are those
   which would provide information. Although the NHRP Protocol [16],
   requires or has this information, exposing it in a MIB would
   jeopardize the entire NBMA domain where NHRP was being used.
   Therefore, these items have been omitted from the MIB.

     1. (configurable) enable/disable security
     2. (configurable) SPI (security parameter index).
        Depending upon the implementation,
        there may be multiple SPIs, and these would

        be configurable also.  For example, if the
        implementation switched to a different SPI
        after a given time.
     3. (configurable) algorithm.
        The HMAC-MD5-128 is the default hash algorithm.
     4. (configurable) lifetime value in seconds.
     5. (read-only) key.
     6. (read-only) list of users who have access
        to the above information.
