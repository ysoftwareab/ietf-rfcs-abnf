               draft-ietf-urnbis-semantics-clarif-02.txt

Abstract

   Experience has shown that identifiers associated with persistent
   names have properties and requirements that may be somewhat different
   from identifiers associated with the locations of objects.  This is
   especially true when such names are expected to be stable for a very
   long time or when they identify large and complex entities.  In order
   to allow Uniform Resource Names (URNs) to evolve to meet the needs of
   the Library, Museum, Publisher, and Information Science communities
   and other users, this specification separates URNs from the semantic
   constraints that many people believe are part of the specification
   for Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) in RFC 3986, updating that
   document accordingly.  The syntax of URNs is still constrained to
   that of RFC 3986, so generic URI parsers are unaffected by this
   change.

1.  Introduction

   The Generic URI Syntax specification [RFC3986] covers both locators
   and names and mixtures of the two (See its Section 1.1.3) and
   describes Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) -- first documented in the
   IETF in RFC 1738 [RFC1738] -- as an embodiment of the locator concept
   and Uniform Resource Names (URNs), specifically those using the "urn"
   scheme [RFC2141], as an embodiment of the names that do not directly
   provide for resource location.  This specification is concerned only
   about URNs of the variety described in RFC 2141 [RFC2141] and its
   successors [RFC2141bis] (i.e., those that use the "urn" scheme).
   URLs, other types of names, and any URI types that may not fall into

   one of the above categories are out of its scope and unaffected by
   it.

   Experience with URNs since the publication of RFC 3986 has identified
   several ways in which their inclusion under its scope has hampered
   understanding, adoption, and especially extension (specifically
   extensions of types that were anticipated in RFC 2141).  The need for
   extensions to the URN concept is now being felt in some communities,
   especially those that include libraries, museums, publishers, and
   other information scientists.

   In particular, the Generic URI Syntax specification goes beyond
   syntax to specify the meaning and interpretation of various fields,
   especially the "query" and "fragment" ones and the various syntax
   forms and interpretations it allows for <hier-part>.  This
   specification excludes URNs from those definitions of meaning and
   interpretation so that RFC 3986 applies to their syntax only.  The
   meaning --and any more specific syntax rules-- for those fields for
   URNs are now defined in a URN-specific document [RFC2141bis].  URNs
   remain members of the URI family and parsers for generic URI syntax
   are not affected by this specification although parsers that make
   assumptions based on other URI schemes obviously might be.

   This specification does not discuss DDDS [RFC3401] resolution or
   conversion to (and interpretation of) URCs [RFC2483] or URN
   "resolution" more generally.  Any of those topics that do need to be
   addressed should be covered in other documents.  The document also
   does not discuss alternatives to URNs, either those that might use a
   different scheme name within the RFC 3986 URI framework or those that
   might use a different framework entirely.  In particular, some
   externally-defined content or object identification systems could be
   represented either by a URN namespace or through separate URI
   schemes.  This specification does not offer advice on that choice
   other than to suggest that the two options not be confused (or both
   used in a way that would be confusing).

   This document updates RFC 3986 to make the distinction between syntax
   and semantics clear for URNs and to isolate URNs from presumed URI
   semantic requiremnts.  It is important to note that some readers of
   RFC 3986 are convinced that the separation is clear in that
   specification and therefore that no changes to that document are
   needed.  For them, this specification is only a confirming
   clarification.

   In the long term, as the expanded syntax and uses of URNs become
   commonplace and RFC 3986 is updated, this specification is likely to
   become of historical interest only, providing an extended rationale

Internet-Draft                URN Semantics                  August 2015


   for decisions made and adjustment of the boundary between URN
   specifications and generic URI ones.

2.  Pragmatic Goals

   Despite the important background and rationale in the sections that
   follow, the change made (or clarification provided) by this
   specification is driven by a desire to avoid philosophical debates
   about terminology or ultimate truths.  Instead, it is motivated by
   three very pragmatic principles and goals:

   1.  Accommodate all of those who think URNs are necessary, i.e., that
       they can and should be usefully distinguished from other URIs, at
       least location-oriented ones including URI schemes defined prior
       to the time work started on this document in August 2014.  In
       particular, provide a foundation for extensions to the URN syntax
       (as allowed by and defined in RFC 2141) to support requirements
       encountered by some of those communities.

   2.  Provide a path to avoid getting bogged down in declarative
       statements about definitions and debates about what is and is not
       correct in the abstract.

   3.  Avoid a fork in the standard that would be likely to lead to
       multiple, conflicting, definitions or criteria for URNs.

   In addition, this document is intended to move past debates about
   whether or not URNs are intended to be parsed at all (i.e., whether a
   "urn"-scheme URI is simply opaque to a URI parser once the scheme
   name is identified) and, if not, how much of it is actually expected
   to be understood and broken into identifiable parts by such a parser.
   It establishes a principle that, for the "urn" scheme, parsing into
   the components identified in RFC 3986 will be performed but that any
   meanings or interpretation assigned to those components (including
   that applicability of the normal English meanings of such terms as
   "query" or "fragment" are a matter for URN-specific specifications.
   It helps lay the foundarion for the distinguishing terms
   "p-component", "q-component", and "f-component" in the accompanying
   URN definition specification [RFC2141bis].

3.  The role of queries and fragments in URNs

   Part of the concern that led to this document was a desire to
   accommodate URN components that would be analogous to the query and
   fragment components of generalized URNs but that might have different
   properties.  For many cases, the analogy cannot be exact.  For
   example, RFC 3986 ties the interpretation of fragments to media
   types.  Since media type is a function of specific content, URNs that

Internet-Draft                URN Semantics                  August 2015


   are never resolved cannot have an associated media type, nor can URNs
   that resolve to, for example, other URIs that may then not be
   resolved further.  Similarly, while the RFC 3986 syntax for queries
   (and fragments) may be entirely appropriate for URN use, terminology
   like "Service Request" (see Appendix B of the predecessor "URNs are
   not..." draft [ServiceRequests] for additional discussion) may be
   more suitable to the URN context than "query" (if, indeed, the
   portion of the URN that is syntactically equivalent to a URI query is
   where those requests belong).

4.  Changes to RFC 3986

   This specification removes URN semantics from the scope of RFC 3896.
   It makes no changes to the generic URI syntax.  That syntax still
   applies to URNs as well as to other URI types.  Even as regard to
   semantics, it has no practical effect for URNs defined in strict
   conformance to the prior URN specification [RFC2141] or the
   associated registration specification [RFC3406].

   In particular, the generic URI syntax for path segments that appear
   after the NID and NSS of a URN, i.e., after an initial "/", for
   "queries" (strings starting with "?" and continuing to the end of the
   URI or to a "#"), and for "fragments" (strings starting with "#" and
   continuing to the end of the URI) is unchanged, but the terms for
   those path segments, "query" and "fragment" become, for URNs, terms
   of convenience that are defined in URN-specific ways as p-components,
   q-components, and f-components [RFC2141bis].

5.  Actions Occurring in Parallel with this Specification

   The basic URN syntax specification [RFC2141] was published well
   before RFC 3986 and therefore does not depend on it.  The successor
   to that specification [RFC2141bis], fully spells out, or references
   documents that spell out, the semantics and any required within-field
   syntax of URNs.  It uses great care about generic or implicit
   reference to any URI specification and delegates further details to
   specific namespaces.

   [[CREF1: Note in Draft: Perhaps this section can be dropped
   entirely.]]

6.  Acknowledgments

   This specification was inspired by a search in the IETF URNBIS WG for
   an approach that would both satisfy the needs of persistent name-type
   identifiers and still fully conform to the specifications and intent
   of RFC 3986.  That search lasted several years and considered many
   alternatives.  Discussions with Leslie Daigle, Juha Hakala, Barry

   Leiba, Keith Moore, Andrew Newton, and Peter Saint-Andre during the
   last quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 were particularly
   helpful in arriving at the conclusion that a conceptual separation of
   notions of location-based identifiers (e.g., URLs) and the types of
   persistent identifiers represented by URNs was necessary.  Juha
   Hakala provided useful explanations and significant working text
   about the needs of the library community and their perception of
   identifiers and consequent implications for URN structure.  Peter
   Saint-Andre provided significant text in a pre-publication review.
   The author also appreciates the efforts of several people, notably
   Tim Berners-Lee, Leslie Daigle, Larry Masinter, Keith Moore, Juha
   Hakala, Julian Reschke, Lars Svensson, Henry S.  Thompson, and Dale
   Worely, to challenge text and ideas and demand answers to hard
   questions.  Whether they agree with the results or not, their
   insights have contributed significantly to whatever clarity and
   precision appears in the present document.

   The specification was changed considerably and its focus narrowed
   after an extended discussion at the WG meeting during IETF 90 in July
   2014 [IETF90-URNBISWG] and subsequent comments and clarifications on
   the mailing list [URNBIS-MailingList].  The contributions of all of
   the participants in those discussions, only some of whose names
   appear above, are gratefully acknowledged.

8.  IANA Considerations

   [[CREF2: RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.]]

   This memo is not believed to require any action on IANA's part.  In
   particular, we note that there is a collection of "Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) Schemes" that does not include URNs and a series of
   URN-specific registries that do not rely on the URI specificstions.

9.  Security Considerations

   This specification changes the semantics of URNs to make them self-
   contained (as specified in other documents), relying on the generic
   URI syntax specification for syntax only.  It should have no effect
   on Internet security unless the use of a definition, syntax, and
   semantics that are more clear reduces the potential for confusion and
   consequent vulnerabilities.

Appendix A.  Background on the URN - URI relationship

   The Internet community now has many years of experience with both
   name-type identifiers and location-based identifiers (or "references"
   for those who are sensitive to the term "identifier" such as many
   members of the library and information science communities..  The
   primary examples of these two categories are Uniform Resource Names
   (URNs [RFC2141] [RFC2141bis]) and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)
   [RFC1738]).  That experience leads to the conclusion that it is
   impractical to constrain URNs to the high-level semantics of URLs.
   The generic syntax for URIs [RFC3986] is adequately flexible to
   accommodate the perceived needs of URNs, but the specific semantics
   associated with the URI syntax definition -- what particular
   constructions "mean" and how and where they are interpreted -- appear
   to not be.  Generalization from URLs to generic Uniform Resource
   Identifiers (URIs) [RFC3986], especially to name-based, high-
   stability, long-persistence, identifiers such as many URNs, has
   failed because the assumed similarities do not adequately extend to
   all forms of URNs.  Ultimately, locators, which typically depend on
   particular accessing protocols and a specification relative to some
   physical space or network topology, are simply different creatures
   from long-persistence, location-independent, object identifiers.  The
   syntax and semantic constraints that are appropriate for locators are

   either irrelevant to or interfere with the needs of resource names as
   a class.  That was tolerable as long as the URN system didn't need
   additional capabilities (over those specified in RFC 2141) but
   experience since RFC 2141 was published has shown that they are, in
   fact, needed.

Appendix B.  Change Log

   [[CREF3: RFC Editor: Please remove this appendix before
   publication.]]

B.1.  Changes from draft-ietf-urnbis-urns-are-not-uris-00 (2014-04-07)
      to -01 (2014-07-03)

   o  Revised Section 1 slightly and added some new material to try to
      address questions raised on the mailing list.

   o  Added Section 2, reflecting an email exchange.

   o  Added a Security Considerations section, replacing the placeholder
      in the previous version.

   o  Added later-deleted Appendix B and inserted a note in the material
      titled "A Perspective on Locations and Names" pointing to it (that
      material was removed from draft-ietf-urnbis-semantics-clarif-01,
      but was Section 2 and then Section 3 in earlier versions).

   o  Added temporary Appendix B for this version only.

   o  Enhanced and updated the Acknowledgments section.

   o  The usual small clarifications and editorial changes.

B.2.  Changes from draft-ietf-urnbis-urns-are-not-uris-01 to draft-ietf-
      urnbis-semantics-clarif-00 (2014-08-25)

   o  Changed title and file name to better reflect changes summarized
      below.  Note that the predecessor of this document was draft-ietf-
      urnbis-urns-are-not-uris-01.

   o  Revised considerably as discussed on the mailing list and at IETF
      90.  In particular, the document has been narrowed to change
      semantics only without affecting the relationship to URI syntax
      and the document title and other details changed to match.

   o  Dropped much of the original Introduction (moving it temporarily
      to an appendix) and trimmed the abstract to be consistent with the
      new, more limited. scope.

      appendix text.

   o  Added new material to discuss the next round of decisions the WG
      will have to make, assuming this provisions of this specification
      are approved.  That material was removed from draft-ietf-urnbis-
      semantics-clarif-01.

B.3.  Changes from draft-ietf-urnbis-semantics-clarif-00 (2014-08-25) to
      -01

   o  Removed some appendices and the topic discussion material, as
      discused in the previous draft.

   o  Aligned the document and its terminology somewhat better with
      draft-ietf-urnbis-rfc2141bis-urn-09 including providing for
      p-components and using the p-/q-/f-component terminology.

   o  Made several clarifying changes to reflect mailing list
      discussions (mostly of 2141bis) since the earlier version was
      posted.

   o  Revised earlier portions of this change tracking appendix to
      remove referenced to deleted material.  It is not possible to
      reconstruct what earlier versions of this document contained by
      examining these change summaries.

   o  Moved specific comments about the IETF 90 discussions to
      Acknowledgments and removed or edited some material that was only
      appropriate for a discussion piece.

   o  Made several small editorial changes as usual.

B.4.  Changes from draft-ietf-urnbis-semantics-clarif-01 (2015-02-14) to
      -02

   o  Reissued to keep draft alive; no substantive changes.

   o  Updated references, including some that were already outdated in
      -01.
