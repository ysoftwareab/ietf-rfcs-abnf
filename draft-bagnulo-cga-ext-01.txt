Internet-Draft         CGA Extension Field Format             March 2006


1.  Introduction

   Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) specification [1] defines
   Extension Fields that allow including additional information into the
   CGA Parameter Data Structure.  So far there seems to be enough
   interest in including additional data items into the CGA Parameter
   Data Structure through these Extension Fields that it seems
   reasonable to expect that more than one mechanism will require its
   usage.  In order to simplify the addition of multiple data items,
   this document defines a Type-Length-Value format for the Extension
   Fields.


2.  CGA Extension Field Format

   Data items to be included in Extension Fields of the CGA Parameter
   Data Structure MUST be encoded using the following Type-Length-Value
   (TLV) format:



      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Extension Type        |   Extension Data Length       |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                                                               |
     ~                       Extension Data                          ~
     |                                                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                                                    .


   Extension Type: 16-bit identifier of the type of the Extension Field.

   Extension Data Length: 16-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the
      Extension Data field of this option, in octets.

   Extension Data: Variable-length field.  Extension-Type-specific data.


3.  IANA considerations

   This document defines a Extension Type field for which IANA is to
   create and maintain a registry entitled "CGA Extension Type".  The
   values in this name space are 16-bit unsigned integers.  Initial
   values for the CGA Extension Type field are given below; future
   assignments are to be made through RFC Required, Expert Review or

   IESG approval [2].  Assignments consist of a name and the value.

   As recommended in [3], this document makes the following assignments
   for experimental and testing use: the value 0xFFFD with name
   Exp_FFFD, the value 0xFFFE with name Exp_FFFE and the value 0xFFFF
   with name Exp_FFFF.


4.  Security considerations

   No security concerns are raised by the adoption of the CGA Extension
   format described in this document.
