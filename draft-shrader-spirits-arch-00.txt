Abstract

   This document defines an architecture framework and functional
   requirements for Service in the PSTN/IN Requesting Internet Service
   (SPIRITS). The framework describes relationships between
   functional entities for interactions between the PSTN and SPIRITS Server
   and provides requirements for the SPIRITS protocol.

   This document is submitted to the IETF SPIRITS working group for discussion
   and comment. Discussion on this topic should be sent to the SPIRITS
   mailing list (spirits@lists.research.bell-labs.com).


1. Introduction

This document defines an architecture framework and functional requirements for 
Service in the PSTN/IN Requesting Internet Service. The architecture addresses 
how services supported by IP network entities can be started from IN 
(Intelligent Network) can request actions to be carried out in the IP network 
in response to events occurring in the PSTN/IN. The architecture and protocol 
should support secure transport of IN requests for actions, as well as plain 
event notifications and parameters from the PSTN/IN to the IP network, and 
optional responses from the IP network back to the PSTN/IN.

Based on this architecture, basic requirements for the methodology for 
constructing the building blocks of the SPIRITS protocol.

   The rest of this Internet Draft is as follows:

      Section II describes the functional architecture;

      Section III describes applicable physical architectures;

      Section IV provides requirements for the protocol to be defined;

      Section V addresses management of the SPIRITS system;

      Section VI contains security considerations;

      Section VII contains abbreviations

      Section VIII contains the acknowledgements;

      Section IX contains references; and


2. Functional Architecture

The SPIRITS functional architecture includes three potentially independent 
entities:

- the PSTN/IN requesting system

- the SPIRITS client

- the SPIRITS server


                 ------------
    ------      | PSTN/IN    |      ---------       ---------       ------
   | User |-----| Requesting |-----| SPIRITS |-----| SPIRITS |-----| Opt. |
    ------      | System     |     | Client  |     | Server  |     | User |
                 -------------      ---------       ---------       ------

The following elements compose the SPIRITS functional architecture:

User - the originating call participant on a call that is served by the PSTN 
system.

PSTN/IN Requesting System - the element (or network of elements) involved in 
detecting that SPIRITS service invocation is required.

SPIRITS Client - the entity that notifies an IP server or requests some actions 
to be performed in the IP network.

SPIRITS Server - the entity that receives notifications or requests and returns 
optional responses.

Opt. User - a user that is optionally consulted by the SPIRITS server in the 
process or handling the request

The interactions between the SPIRITS Client and the SPIRITS Server is the 
subject of the SPIRITS protocol. The other interfaces are assumed but not 
specifically addressed by the SPIRITS protocol.

3. Physical Architecture

The SPIRITS functional model is flexible to allow for application of the 
SPIRITS mechanism to be used to support the many different forms of PSTN/IN 
systems currently in use. As such, several physical architectures are presented 
that SPIRITS is intended to support.

The following architectures are defined:

1. PSTN/IN based on Intelligent Network
   The SPIRITS Client can be collocated with the IN Service Switching Point, IN
   Services Node, or IN Service Control Point.
2. Wireless Intelligent Network
   The SPIRITS Client can be collocated with the WIN Service Control Point, 
   HLR, VLR, or MSC.
3. Private Enterprise System
   The Private Enterprise System can be a SPIRITS Client.
4. Decomposed system utilizing Megaco/H.248
   The Media Gateway Controller can perform SPIRITS Client functions directly
   or via an IN Service Control Point.
5. H.323 System
   The H.323 Gatekeeper can perform SPIRITS Client functions directly.
6. SIP System
   The SIP Server can perform SPIRITS Client functionality (and SPIRITS Server
   functionality when a call processing script is involved?)

Figures for these architectures to be provided in an Appendix.


4. Protocol Requirements

My first thoughts on protocol requirements...

The SPIRITS protocol SHOULD support forwarding to subsequent servers via proxy.

The SPIRITS protocol SHOULD support forwarding to subsequent servers via 
redirect.

The SPIRITS protocol MUST support dynamic arming of events.

The SPIRITS protocol SHOULD support requests for subsequent information from 
the originating user.

The SPIRITS protocol MUST be extensible.
