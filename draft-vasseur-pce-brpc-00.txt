1.  History

   The aim of this document is to specify a Backward Recursive PCE-based
   Computation (BRPC) procedure to compute shortest constrained inter-
   domain (G)MPLS TE LSP.  Such procedure had been initially documented
   in draft-vasseur-ccamp-inter-domain-path-comp (Scenario 2) and is now
   moved to a separated ID in the light of the progress made by the PCE
   Working Group.


2.  Terminology

   ABR Routers: routers used to connect two IGP areas (areas in OSPF or
   levels in IS-IS).

   ASBR Routers: routers used to connect together ASs of a different or
   the same Service Provider via one or more Inter-AS links.

   Boundary LSR: a boundary LSR is either an ABR in the context of
   inter- area TE or an ASBR in the context of inter-AS TE.

   Inter-AS TE LSP: A TE LSP that crosses an AS boundary.

   Inter-area TE LSP: A TE LSP that crosses an IGP area.

   LSR: Label Switch Router.

   LSP: Label Switched Path.

   PCE (Path Computation Element): an entity (component, application or
   network node) that is capable of computing a network path or route
   based on a network graph and applying computational constraints.

   TED: Traffic Engineering Database.

   VSPT: Virtual Shortest Path Tree.

   The notion of contiguous, stitched and nested TE LSPs is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-rsvp-te] and will not be repeated here.


3.  Introduction

   The requirements for inter-area and inter-AS MPLS Traffic Engineering
   have been developed by the Traffic Engineering Working Group (TE WG)
   and have been stated in [RFC4105] and [RFC4216], respectively.

   The framework for inter-domain MPLS Traffic Engineering has been



Vasseur, et al.         Expires November 5, 2006                [Page 3]

   provided in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-framework].

   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-pd-path-comp] proposes a path
   computation technique for computing inter-domain (G)MPLS TE LSP
   whereby the path is computed on a per-domain basis by the entry
   border node of each domain (each node in charge of computing a
   section of an inter-domain TE LSP path is always along the path of
   such TE LSP).  Such path computation technique fulfills some of the
   requirements stated in [RFC4105] and [RFC4216] but not all of them.
   In particular, it cannot guarantee to find an optimal (shortest)
   inter-domain constrained path.  Furthermore, it cannot be efficiently
   used to compute a set of inter-domain diversely routed TE LSPs.

   The aim of this document is to describe a PCE-based TE LSP
   computation procedure to compute optimal inter-domain constrained
   (G)MPLS TE LSPs.  Although one model consists of making the boundary
   routers act as PCE, the Backward Recursive PCE-based Computation
   (BRPC) procedure is not limited to that model.

   Qualifying a path as optimal requires some clarification.  Indeed, a
   globally optimal TE LSP placement usually refers to a set of TE LSPs
   whose placements optimize the network resources with regards to a
   specified objective function (e.g. a placement that reduces the
   maximum or average network load while satisfying the TE LSP
   constraints).  In this document, an optimal inter-domain constrained
   TE LSP is defined as the shortest path, satisfying the set of
   required constraints, that would be obtained in the absence of
   multiple domains (in other words, in a totally flat network between
   the source and destination of the TE LSP).  The mechanisms proposed
   in this document are also applicable to (G)MPLS TE domains other than
   areas and ASs.


4.  General assumptions

   In the rest of this document, we make the following set of
   assumptions common to inter-area and inter-AS TE:

   - Each area or AS is assumed to be Traffic Engineering enabled (i.e.
   running OSPF-TE or ISIS-TE and RSVP-TE).

   - No topology or resource information is distributed between domains
   (as mandated per [RFC4105] and [RFC4216]), which is critical to
   preserve IGP/BGP scalability and confidentiality in the case of TE
   LSPs spanning multiple domains.

   - While certain constraints like bandwidth can be used across
   different domains, certain other TE constraints like resource



Vasseur, et al.         Expires November 5, 2006                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        draft-vasseur-pce-brpc-00.txt             May 2006


   affinity, color, metric, etc. as listed in [RFC2702] could be
   translated at domain boundaries.  If required, it is assumed that, at
   the domain boundary LSRs, there will exist some sort of local mapping
   based on offline policy agreement, in order to translate such
   constraints across domain boundaries during the inter-PCE
   communication process.

   - The various ASBRs are BGP peers, without any IGP running on the
   inter-ASBR links.

   - RSVP-TE is assumed to be enabled on the Inter-ASBR links.

   - Each AS can be made of several IGP areas.  The path computation
   procedure described in this document applies to the case of a single
   AS made of multiple IGP areas, multiples ASs made of a single IGP
   area or any combination of the above.  For the sake of simplicity,
   each AS will be considered to be comprised of a single area in this
   document.  The case of an Inter-AS TE LSP spanning multiple ASs where
   some of those ASs are themselves made of multiple IGP areas can be
   easily derived from this case by applying the BRPC procedure
   described in this document, recursively.

   - The domain path (set of domains traversed to reach the destination
   domain) is either administratively pre-determined or discovered by
   some means (outside of the scope of this document).


5.  BRPC Procedure

   The BRPC procedure is a Multiple-PCE path computation technique as
   described in [I-D.ietf-pce-architecture].  A possible model consists
   of hosting the PCE function on boundary routers (e.g., ABR or ASBR)
   but this is not mandated by the BRPC path computation procedure.

   BRPC does not make any assumptions with regards to the nature of the
   inter-domain TE LSP that could be contiguous, nested or stitched.

   No assumption is made on the actual path computation algorithm in use
   by a PCE (it can be any variant of CSPF, algorithm based on linear-
   programming to solve multi-constraints optimization problems and so
   on).

5.1.  Domain path selection

   The PCE based BRPC path computation procedure applies to the
   computation of an optimal constrained inter-domain TE LSP.  The
   sequence of domains to be traversed can either be determined a priori
   or during the path computation procedure.

Internet-Draft        draft-vasseur-pce-brpc-00.txt             May 2006


5.2.  Elements of procedure

   Terminology

   - PCE(i) is a PCE with the scope of domain(i).

   - Boundary Router (BR): ABR or ASBR.

   - Entry BR of domain(n): a BR connecting domain(n-1) to domain(n).

   - Exit BR of domain(n): a BR connecting domain(n) to domain(n+1).

   - In each domain i:

   * a set of X-en(i) entry BRs noted BR-en(k,i) where BR-en(k,i) is the
   kth entry BR of domain(i).

   * a set of X-ex(i) exit BR noted BR-ex(k,i) where BR-ex(k,i) is the
   kth exit BR of domain(i).

   Definition of VSPT(i)

   A virtual shortest path tree VSPT(i) returned by PCE(i) to PCE(i-1)
   has the following form:


               Root (TE LSP destination)
               /         I            \
         BR-en(1,i)   BR-en(2,i) ... BR-en((j), i).

   Where j<= [X-en(i)]



   Each link of VSPT(i) represents the shortest path between the
   destination and BR-en(j,i) that satisfies the set of required
   constraints for the TE LSP (bandwidth, affinities, ...).  These are
   path segments to reach the destination from BR-en(j,i).

   Note that PCE(i) would only consider BRs having connectivity with
   BR(s) of domain(i-1) in the VSPT(i).  Furthermore, some BRs may be
   excluded according to policy constraints (either due to local policy
   or policies signaled in the path computation request).

   Step 1: the PCC needs to first determine the PCE capable of serving
   its path computation request.  The path computation request is then
   relayed until reaching a PCE(n) such that the TE LSP destination
   resides in the domain(n).  At each step of the process, the next PCE



Vasseur, et al.         Expires November 5, 2006                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        draft-vasseur-pce-brpc-00.txt             May 2006


   can either be statically configured or dynamically discovered via
   IGP/BGP extensions.  If no next PCE can be found or the next hop PCE
   of choice is unavailable, the procedure stops and a path computation
   error is returned (see section Section 7).  If multiple PCEs are
   discovered, the PCE may select a subset of these PCEs based on some
   local policies/heuristics.  Note also that a sequence of PCEs might
   be enforced by policy on the PCC and this constraint can be either
   carried in the PCEP path computation request (defined in [I-D.ietf-
   pce-pcep].

   Step 2: PCE(n) computes VSPT(n) made of the list of shortest
   constrained path(s) between every BR-en(j,n) and the TE LSP
   destination using a suitable path computation algorithm (e.g.  CSPF)
   and returns the computed VSPT(n) to PCE(n-1).

   Step i:

   - For i=n-1 to 2:

   PCE(i) concatenates the ASi topology (using its TED) with the
   received VSPT(i+1) and computes VSPT(i).

   In the case of Inter-AS TE, this operation also includes the links
   connecting ASBRs of ASi and ASi+1.

   End

   Each branch of the VSPT tree (path) may be returned in the form of an
   explicit path (in which case all the hops along the path segment are
   listed) or a loose path (in which case only the BR is specified) so
   as to preserve confidentiality along with the respective cost.

   Note: in term of computation of an inter-AS TE LSP path, an
   interesting optimization for the computation of unidirectional TE LSP
   consists of allowing the ASBRs to flood the TE information related to
   the inter-ASBR link(s) although no IGP TE is enabled over those links
   (and so there is no IGP adjacency over the inter-ASBR links).  This
   of course implies for the inter-ASBR links to be TE-enabled although
   no IGP is running on those links.  This allows the PCE of a domain to
   get entire TE visibility up to the set of entry ASBRs in the
   downstream domain.

   BRPC guarantees to find the optimal (shortest) constrained inter-
   domain TE LSP according to a set of defined domains to be traversed.
   Note that other variants of the BRPC procedure relying on the same
   principles are also possible.  Note also that in case of ECMP paths,
   more than one path could be returned to the requesting LSR.  The BRPC
   procedure may be used to compute path segments and could be used in

   conjunction with other path computation techniques (such as the per-
   domain path computation technique defined in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-inter-
   domain-pd-path-comp]) to compute the end-to-end path.  In this case
   end-to-end path optimality can no longer be guaranteed.


6.  PCEP Protocol Extensions

   The BRPC path computation procedure requires the specification of a
   new flag of the RP object carried within the PCReq message (defined
   in [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep]), the aim of which is to specify that the
   shortest path(s) satisfying the constraints from the destination to
   the set of entry boundary routers are requested (such set of path(s)
   forms the downstream VSPT as specified in Section 5.2).

   The following new flag is defined: VSPT (V) flag: 0x20.  When set,
   this indicates that the PCC requests the computation of an inter-
   domain TE LSP using the BRPC procedure.

   Because path segment(s) computed by a downstream PCE in the context
   of the BRPC procedure must be provided along with their respective
   path cost(s), the C flag of the RP object carried within the PCReq
   message MUST be set.  It is the choice of the requester to
   appropriately set the O bit of the RP object.

   The destination IP address of the VSPT object corresponds to the VSPT
   root (TE LSP's destination) and is provided by the PCC originating
   the path computation request.


7.  BRPC procedure completion failure

   If the BRPC procedure cannot be completed because a PCE along the
   domain path does not support the procedure, a PCErr message is
   returned by the upstream PCE with a Error-Type "BRPC procedure
   completion failure".  The PCErr message MUST be relayed to the
   requesting PCC.

   PCEP-ERROR objects are used to report a PCEP protocol error and are
   characterized by an Error-Type which specifies the type of error and
   an Error-value that provides additional information about the error
   type.  Both the Error-Type and the Error-Value are managed by IANA.
   A new Error-Type is defined that relates to the BRPC path computation
   procedure.

                                along the domain path


8.  Metric normalization

   In the case of inter-area TE, the same IGP/TE metric scheme is
   usually adopted for all the IGP areas (e.g. based on the link-speed,
   propagation delay or some other combination of link attributes).
   Hence, the proposed set of mechanisms always computes the shortest
   path across multiple areas obeying the required set of constraints
   with respect to a well-specified objective function.  Conversely, in
   the case of Inter-AS TE, in order for this path computation to be
   meaningful, a metric normalization between ASs may be required.  One
   solution to avoid IGP metric modification would be for the SPs to
   agree on a TE metric normalization scheme and use the TE metric for
   TE LSP path computation (in that case, this must be requested in the
   PCEP Path computation request) thanks to the COST object.


9.  Diverse end-to-end path computation

   The PCEP protocol allows an LSR to request the computation of a set
   of diversely routed TE LSPs.  In the context of the BRPC procedure, a
   set of diversely routed TE LSP between two LSRs can be computed since
   the paths segment(s) of the VSPT are simultaneously computed by a
   given PCE.  Such a PCE-based path computation method allows for the
   computation of diverse paths under various objective functions (such
   as minimizing the sum of the costs of the N diverse paths, etc) in a
   very efficient manner, thus avoiding the well-known "trapping"
   problem: Indeed, with a 2-step approach consisting of computing the
   first path followed by the computation of the second path after
   having removed the set of network elements traversed by the first
   path (if that does not violate confidentiality preservation), one
   cannot guarantee that a solution will be found even if such solution
   exists.  Furthermore, even if a solution is found, it may not be the
   most optimal one with respect to objective function such as
   minimizing the sum of the paths costs, bounding the path delays of
   both paths and so on.  Finally, it must be noted that such a 2-step
   path computation approach is usually less efficient in term of
   signalling delays since it requires two serialized TE LSP set up.


10.  Path optimality

   BRPC guarantees that the optimal (shortest) constrained inter-domain
   path will always be found subject to policy constraints.  It must be
   noted that although the BRPC procedure applies to any type of inter-
   domain TE LSP (e.g. contiguous, stitched or nested), the use of local
   reoptimization with a stitched TE LSP may no longer guarantee to
   preserve the path optimality of the end-to-end path should the BRPC
   procedure be used in the first place.


11.  Reoptimization of an inter-domain TE LSP

   The ability to reoptimize an existing inter-domain TE LSP path has
   been explicitly listed as a requirement in [RFC4105] and [RFC4216].
   In the case of a TE LSP reoptimization request, regular procedures
   apply as defined in PCEP where the path in use (if available on the
   head-end) is provided within the path computation request in order
   for the PCEs involved in the reoptimization request to avoid double
   bandwidth accounting.


12.  IANA Considerations

   A new flag of the RP object (specified in [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep]) is
   defined in this document.

   Name: VSPT (V)

   Value: 0x20.

   When set, this indicates that the PCC requests the computation of an
   inter-domain TE LSP using the BRPC procedure.

   A new Error-Type is defined in this document (Error-Type and Error-
   value to be assigned by IANA).

    Error-type          Meaning
        10              BRPC procedure completion failure
                         Error-value

                                along the domain path


13.  Security Considerations

   The BRPC procedure does not introduce any additional security issues
   beyond the ones related to inter-PCE communication.
