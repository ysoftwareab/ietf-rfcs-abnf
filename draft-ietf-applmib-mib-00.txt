Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet Community.  In particular, it defines objects used for
   the management of applications.  This MIB complements the System
   Application MIB, providing for the management of applications' common
   aspects which could not typically be observed without the cooperation
   of the software being managed.


1. Introduction

   This draft seeks to further the work begun in the systems application
   mib [11].  In its current form, it identifies far more issues and
   capabilities than can reasonably be addressed in one MIB.  It is
   hoped that the first round of discussion of this document will trim

   this feature set to an essential core that will provide the most
   "bang for the buck" in making applications manageable.

   The development of [1], [2], [3], [4], [8] and [9] provides us with a
   base of experience in making a variety of applications visible to
   management; this specification abstracts out the common aspects of
   applications management and provides a generic base usable for the
   management of almost any application.

2. Overview

   Key topics not handled in system application MIB [11] that must be
   identified as either being inside or outside the scope of this work
   include:


        -    Do we want to provide support for generic application
             throughput measurements?

        -    Do we want to provide MIB definitions that allow management
             to define what is to be considered a unit of work?

        -    Do we want to provide support for generic application
             response time monitoring capabilities?

        -    Do we want to support the management of distributed appli-
             cations as such?  (The indexing structure and semantics of
             the system application MIB [11] are not sufficient for this
             task.)

        -    Do we want to address issues of backup and recovery?

        -    Do we want to address issues of software request, delivery,
             installation, activation, patching, version update, rever-
             sion, and removal?

        -    Do we want to address issues of software validation and
             integrity checks?

        -    Do we want to address issues of software licensing?

        -    Do we want to address generic resource management issues,
             such as:

             -    files in use?

             -    I/O statistics?

             -    other resources?

             -    dependency information?

        -    Do we want to provide a generic error logging (stderr)
             capability?

             -    What categories of application errors are of interest?

             -    Do we want to provide MIB definitions that allow man-
                  agement to define what is to be considerred an error?

             -    How manageable should the log itself be?  (And perhaps
                  whether this should really be pursued in disman)

   Note that these issues are addressed at least in part by other stan-
   dards work, including [12] and [13].

   Topics specifically out of scope:

3. Architecture

   To emulate the object-oriented modeling techniques of subclassing and
   multiple inheritance, the SNMP information model provides for the use
   of tables with common indexes.  The challenge for the developer of
   management applications is to recognize those situations in which
   various aspects of a single logical resource are represented in sev-
   eral different tables, possibly defined in different MIBs.

   Most of the management information defined here may pertain to any
   number of applications in a managed system.  The simplest way of sup-
   porting this requirement within the SNMP information model is to use
   tables.  This means that the management information for a particular
   resource may be found in one or more rows of one or more tables; the
   fact that this information pertains to a single resource may be
   deduced from the index values used, possibly with the support of map-
   ping tables.  This also means that a single table may contain manage-
   ment information relevant to a number of applications.  This has sig-
   nificant implementation implications; see the implementation issues
   section below for more information.

   Relationships to other MIBs

   This section will outline the relationships of the components of this
   MIB (usually in the form of common indexing structures) to:

     -    the systems applications MIB [11]

     -    the host resources MIB [1]

     -    the entity MIB [8]

     -    the network services monitoring MIB [2]

   Relationship to NSM

   The Network Services Monitoring MIB is defined as the base set of
   attributes for managing network applications.  This MIB extends that
   set of attributes to include information normally obtainable only
   from the managed resource itself, rather than the supporting system.

   The nsmToSysApplElmtRunTable is defined to provide the relationship
   between the NSM and sysApplMIB frameworks.

   Relationship to sysAppl

   The sysApplMIB defines attributes for management of applications
   which can be realized without instrumenting an application.  This
   sepcification extends that framework to include additional attributes
   which will typically require instrumentation within the managed
   resource.


4. MIB Structure

   The open files table

   The open files table contains one entry for file in use by the man-
   aged application.  If multiple applications open the same file, it
   will appear as many times in this table as there are applications
   opening that file.  Entries in this table are indexed by the applica-
   tion run index and an arbitrary integer, chosen so that taken
   together the application run index and this integer yield a unique
   key for each open file.  The following information is available in
   this table:

     -    file name

     -    number of read requests

     -    number of bytes read

     -    timestamp of last read operation

Internet Draft         Application Management MIB       25 November 1996


     -    number of write requests

     -    number of bytes written

     -    timestamp of last write operation

     -    number of seek operations

     -    file size
   Special cases to consider: stdin, stdout, stderr, etc.

   The open connections table

   This table extends the capabilities provided by the network services
   monitoring MIB [2].  It includes:

     -

     -

   The transaction statistics table

   Entries in the transaction statistics table are indexed by the appli-
   cation run index and an arbitrary integer, chosen so that taken
   together the application run index and this integer yield a unique
   key for each transaction stream.  A transaction stream may be a file
   or a connection; a column in this table contains the OBJECT IDENTI-
   FIER of the instance in the open files table or open connections
   table.  The information recorded in the entries of this table
   includes:

     -    Transactions received / read

     -    Transactions transmitted / written

     -    Transaction response time (definition gets tricky...)

     The application component details table

     This table provides time stamps, current size, ownership, and other
     information as it extends the sysApplInstallElmt table.

6. Implementation Issues

   Unlike the system application MIB [11], in many environments support
   for much of this MIB requires instrumentation built into the managed
   resource.  Some tables may be implemented by a single monitor pro-
   cess; for others, the implementation may be distributed within the
   managed system with the resources being managed.

   As a practical matter, this means that the management infrastructure
   of the managed system must support different subagents taking respon-
   sibility for different rows of a single table.  This can be supported
   by Agentx [14] as well as other subagent protocols [15].

7. Security Considerations

   By making potentially sensitive information externally accessible,
   the capabilities supported by the MIB have the potential of becoming
   security problems.

   The capabilities supported by this MIB include several that may be of
   value to a security administrator.  These include the ability to

   monitor the level of usage of a given application, to verify
   licenses, and to check the integrity of application components.

11. List of Things Left To Be Done



        -    Split wish list of features into things in-scope and out-
             of-scope

        -    Put in real MIB definitions, verify compilability.
