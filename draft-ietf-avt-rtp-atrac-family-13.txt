1.  Introduction

   The ATRAC family of perceptual audio codecs are designed to address
   numerous needs for high-quality, low bit-rate audio transfer.  ATRAC
   technology can be found in many consumer and professional products
   and applications, including MD players, CD players, voice recorders,
   and mobile phones.  The need for real-time streaming of audio data
   has grown, and this document details our efforts in increasing the
   product and application space for the ATRAC family of codecs.

   Recent advances in ATRAC technology allow for multiple channels of
   audio to be encoded in customizable groupings.  This should allow 
   for future expansions in scaled streaming.  To provide the greatest
   flexibility in streaming any one of the ATRAC family member codecs
   however, this payload format does not distinguish between the codecs
   on a packet level.

   This simplified payload format contains only the basic information
   needed to disassemble a packet of ATRAC audio in order to decode it.
   There is also basic support for fragmentation and redundancy.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [4].

3.  Codec Specific Details

   Early versions of the ATRAC codec handled only two channels of audio
   at 44.1kHz sampling frequency, with typical bit-rates between 66kbps
   and 132kbps.  The latest version allows for a maximum 8 channels of
   audio, up to 96kHz in sampling frequency, and a lossless encoding
   option which can be transmitted in either a scalable (also known as
   High-Speed Transfer mode) or standard (aka Standard mode) format.
   The feasible bit-rate range has also expanded, allowing from a low of
   8kbps up to 1400kbps in lossy encoding modes.

   Depending on the version of ATRAC used, the sample-frame size is
   either 512, 1024 or 2048 samples.  While the lossy and Standard mode
   lossless formats are encoded as sequential single audio frames, 
   High-Speed Transfer mode lossless data comprises two layers -- a 
   lossy base layer and an enhancement layer.
   Although streaming of multi-channel audio is supported depending on
   the ATRAC version used, all encoded audio for a given time period is
   contained within a single frame.  Therefore, there is no interleaving
   nor splitting of audio data on a per-channel basis to be concerned
   with.

4.  RTP Packetization and Transport of ATRAC-Family Streams

4.1  ATRAC Frames

   For transportation of compressed audio data, ATRAC uses the concept
   of frames.  ATRAC frames are the smallest data unit for which timing
   information is attributed.  Frames are octect-aligned by definition.

4.2  Concatenation of Frames

   It is often possible to carry multiple frames in one RTP packet.
   This can be useful in audio, where on a LAN with a 1500 byte MTU, an
   average of 7 complete 64kbps ATRAC frames could be carried in a
   single RTP packet, as each ATRAC frame would be approximately 200
   bytes.  ATRAC frames may be of fixed or variable length.  To
   facilitate parsing in the case of multiple frames in one RTP packet,
   the size of each frame is made known to the receiver by carrying "in
   band" the frame size for each contained frame in an RTP packet.
   However, to simplify the implementation of RTP receivers, it is
   required that when multiple frames are carried in an RTP packet, each
   frame MUST be complete, i.e., the number of frames in an RTP packet
   MUST be integral.

4.3  Frame Fragmentation

   The ATRAC codec can handle very large frames.  As most IP networks
   have significantly smaller MTU sizes than the frame sizes ATRAC can
   handle, this payload format allows for the fragmentation of an ATRAC
   frame over multiple RTP packets.  However, to simplify the
   implementation of RTP receivers, an RTP packet SHALL either carry one
   or more complete ATRAC frames or a single fragment of one ATRAC
   frame.  In other words, RTP packets MUST NOT contain fragments of
   multiple ATRAC frames and MUST NOT contain a mix of complete and
   fragmented frames.

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-ietf-avt-rtp-atrac-family-13.txt    January, 2008


4.4  Transmission of Redundant Frames

   As RTP does not guarantee reliable transmission, receipt of data is
   not assured.  Loss of a packet can result in a "decoding gap" by the
   receiver.  One method to remedy this problem is to allow time-shifted
   copies of ATRAC frames to be sent along with current data.  For a
   modest cost in latency and implementation complexity, error
   resiliency to packet loss can be achieved.

4.5  Scalable Lossless Streaming (High-Speed Transfer mode)

   As ATRAC supports a variation on scalable encoding, this payload
   format provides a mechanism for transmitting essential data (also
   referred to as the base layer) with its enhancement data in two ways
   -- multiplexed through one session or separated over two sessions.
   In either method, only the base layer is essential in producing audio
   data.  The enhancement layer carries the remaining audio data needed
   to decode lossless audio data.  So in situations of limited
   bandwidth, the sender may choose not to transmit enhancement data yet
   still provide a client with enough data to generate lossily-encoded
   audio through the base layer.

4.5.1  Scalable Multiplexed Streaming

   In multiplexed streaming, the base layer and enhancement layer are
   coupled together in each packet, utilizing only one session as 
   illustrated in Figure 1.
   While the packet may begin with either layer type, the two layer 
   types MUST interleave.

   +----------------+  +----------------+  +----------------+
   |Base|Enhancement|--|Base|Enhancement|--|Base|Enhancement| ...
   +----------------+  +----------------+  +----------------+
           N                   N+1                 N+2        : Packet

                Figure 1. Multiplexed strcture

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-ietf-avt-rtp-atrac-family-13.txt    January, 2008


4.5.2  Scalable Multi-Session Streaming

   In multi-session streaming, the base layer and enhancement layer are
   sent over two seperate sessions, allowing clients with certain
   bandwidth limitations to receive just the base layer for decoding as
   illustrated in Figure 2.
   While there may be alternative methods for synchronization of the
   layers, it is RECOMMENDED that the timestamp will be used for
   synchronizing the base layer with its enhancement. Applications can
   determine which sessions are paired together through use of the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) (RFC 4566) [2].  Further details
   are discussed in the section titled "Usage of declarative SDP".
   The two sessions must be synchronised using the information  
   in RTCP SR packets to align the RTP timestamps.
   If the enhancement layer's session data can not arrive until 
   the presentation time, the decoder SHALL decode the Base layer 
   session's data only with ignoring the enhancement layer's data. 


   Session 1:
   +------+  +------+  +------+  +------+
   | Base |--| Base |--| Base |--| Base | ...
   +------+  +------+  +------+  +------+
      N         N+1       N+2       N+3     : Packet


   Session 2:
   +-------------+  +-------------+  +-------------+
   | Enhancement |--| Enhancement |--| Enhancement | ...
   +-------------+  +-------------+  +-------------+
         N                N+1              N+2         : Packet

5.  Payload Format

5.1  Global Structure of Payload Format

   The structure of ATRAC Payload is illustrated in Figure 3.
   The RTP payload following the RTP header contains three 
   octet-aligned data sections, of which the second i.e ATRAC Header 
   Section MAY be empty:

   +------+--------------+-----------------------------+
   |RTP   | ATRAC Header |   ATRAC Frames Section      |
   |Header| Section      | (including redundant data)  |
   +------+--------------+-----------------------------+
   < ---------------- RTP Packet Payload ------------- >

     Figure 3. Structure of RTP Payload of ATRAC family

   The first data section is the ATRAC Header, containing just one
   header with information for the whole packet. The second
   section is where the encoded ATRAC frames are stored.  This may
   contain either a single fragment of one ATRAC frame, or one or more
   complete ATRAC frames. The ATRAC Frames Section MUST NOT be empty.
   In case of using redundant mechanism, the redundant frame data can 
   be included in this section and time stamp MUST be set to the oldest 
   redundant frame's time stamp.

   To benefit from ATRAC's High-Speed Transfer mode lossless encoding
   capability, the RTP payload can be split across two sessions, with
   one transmitting an essential base layer and the other transmitting
   enhancement data.  However in either case, the above structure still
   applies.

   The structure of RTP Standard Header Part is illustrated in Figure 4.

   Version(V): 2 bits
   Set to 2.

   Padding(P): 1 bit
   If the padding bit is set, the packet contains one or more
   additional padding octets at the end which are not part of the
   payload.  The last octet of the padding contains a count of how
   many padding octets should be ignored, including itself.  Padding
   may be needed by some encryption algorithms with fixed block sizes
   or for carrying several RTP packets in a lower-layer protocol data
   unit (see [1]). 

   Extention(X): 1 bit
   Defined by the RTP profile used.

   CSRC count(CC): 4bits
   see RFC 3550[1].

   Marker (M): 1 bit
   Set to 1 if the packet is the first packet after a silence period,
   otherwise it MUST be set to 0. 

   Payload Type (PT): 7 bits
   The assignment of an RTP payload type for this packet format is
   outside the scope of this document; it is specified by the RTP
   profile under which this payload format is used, or signaled
   dynamically out-of-band (e.g., using SDP).

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-ietf-avt-rtp-atrac-family-13.txt    January, 2008


   sequence number: 16bits
   A sequential number for RTP packet. It ranges from 0 to 65535 and
   repeats itself periodically.

   Timestamp: 32 bits
   A timestamp representing the sampling time of the first sample of 
   the first ATRAC frame in the current RTP packet.  
   When using SDP, the clock rate of the RTP timestamp MUST be 
   expressed using the "rtpmap" attribute. 
   For ATRAC3 and ATRAC Advanced Lossless, the RTP timestamp rate
   MUST be 44100Hz.  For ATRAC-X the RTP timestamp rate is 44100Hz or 
   48000Hz, and it will be selected by out-of-band sigalling.

   SSRC: 32bits
   see RFC 3550[1].
   
   CSRC list: 0 to 15 items, 32bits each

5.3 RTP Payload Structure

5.3.1 Usage of ATRAC Header Section

   The ATRAC header section has the fixed length of one byte as 
   illustrated in Figure 5.

   Continuous Flag (C) : 1bit
   The packet which corresponds to the last part of the audio frame data
   in a fragmentaion, SHALL have this bit to 0, otherwise set to 1.

   Fragment Number (FrgNo): 3 bits
   In the event of data fragmentation, this value is 0 for the first
   packet, and increases sequentially for the remaining fragmented data
   packets.

   Number of Frames (NFrames): 4 bits
   The number of audio frames in this packet. This allows for a maximum
   of 16 ATRAC-encoded audio frames per packet, with 0 indicating one 
   audio frame. Each audio frame MUST be complete in the packet if 
   fragmentation is not applied. In case of fragmentation, the data for
   only one audio frame is allowed to be fragmented, and this value MUST
   be 0.

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-ietf-avt-rtp-atrac-family-13.txt    January, 2008


5.3.2  Usage of ATRAC Frames Section

   The ATRAC Frames Section contains an integer number of complete
   ATRAC frames or a single fragment of one ATRAC frame as 
   illustrated in Figure 6. Each ATRAC frame is preceeded by a one-bit 
   flag indicating the layer type and a Block Length field indicating 
   the size in bytes of the ATRAC frame. If more than one ATRAC frame 
   is present, then the frames are concatenated into a contiguous 
   string of bit-flag, Block Length, and ATRAC frame. This section 
   MUST NOT be empty.

   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
             Figure 6. ATRAC Frame Section Format

   Layer Type Flag (E): 1 bit
   Set to 1 if the corresponding ATRAC frame is from an enhancement
   layer. 0 indicates a base layer encoded frame.

   Block length: 15 bits
   The byte length of encoded audio data for the following frame. This
   is so that in the case of fragmentation, if only a subsequent packet
   is received, decoding can still occur. 15 bits allows for a maximum
   block length of 32,767 bytes.  If there are multiple frames in a
   packet, a block-length field exists before each frame data.

   ATRAC frame: The encoded ATRAC audio data.

5.3.2.1 Support of redundancy

   This payload format provides a rudimentary scheme to compensate 
   for occasional packet loss. As every packet's timestamp corresponds
   to the first audio frame regardless of whether it is redundant or
   not, and because we know how many frames of audio each packet 
   encapsulates, if two successive packets are successfully transmitted,
   we can calculate the number of redundant frames being sent.  The
   result gives the client a sense of how the server is responding to
   RTCP reports and to expand its buffer size if necessary.
   As an example of using the Redundant Data, refer to Figure 7 and 8.

   In this example, the server has determined that for the next few
   number of packets, it should send the last two frames from the
   previous packet due to recent RTCP reports.  Thus, between packets 
   N and N+1, there is a redundancy of two frames (which the client

   and N+3 do not arrive at all, after which eventually packet N+4 
   arrives with successive necessary audio frame data.

5.3.2.2  Frame Fragmentation

   Each RTP packet SHALL contain either an integer number of ATRAC
   encoded audio frames (with a maximum of 16), or one ATRAC frame
   fragment.  In the former case, as many complete ATRAC frames as can
   fit in a single path-MTU SHOULD be placed in an RTP packet.  However,
   if even a single ATRAC frame will not fit into a complete RTP packet,
   the ATRAC frame SHOULD be fragmented.

   The start of a fragmented frame gets placed in its own RTP packet,
   its Continuous bit (C) set to one, and its Fragment Number (FragNo)
   set to one.  As the frame must be the only one in the packet, the
   Number of Frames field is zero.  Subsequent packets are to contain
   the remaining fragmented frame data, with the Fragment Number
   increasing sequentially and the Continuous bit (C) consistently set
   to one.  As subsequent packets do not contain any new frames, the
   Number of Frames field SHOULD be ignored.  The last packet of
   fragmented data MUST have the Continuous bit (C) set to zero.

   In addition to the Continuous bit and Fragment Number fields
   indicating fragmentation and a means to reorder the packets, the
   timestamp can be used to determine which packets go together.  Thus,
   packets containing related fragmented frames MUST have identical
   timestamps.
   In the event of fragmentation, the basic redundancy measures MUST 
   NOT be used.

7.  Payload Format Parameters

   Certain parameters will need to be defined before ATRAC family
   encoded content can be streamed.  Other optional parameters may also
   be defined to take advantage of specific features relevant to certain
   ATRAC versions.  Parameters for ATRAC3, ATRAC-X, and ATRAC Advanced
   Lossless are defined here as part of the media subtype registration
   process.  A mapping of these parameters into the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) (RFC 4566) [2] is also provided for applications that
   utilize SDP. These registrations use the template defined in RFC 
   4288 [5] and follow RFC 4855 [6].

   The data format and parameters are specified for real-time transport
   in RTP.

   data to be streamed.  Permissible values are 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 
   160, 192, 256, 320 and 352.

   channelID:  Indicates the number of channels and channel layout
   according to the table1 in Section 7.4.  Note that this layout is
   different from that proposed in RFC 3551 [3].  However, as 
   channelID = 0 defines an ambiguous channel layout, the channel 
   mapping defined in Section 4.1 of [3] could be used. Permissible 
   values are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

   Optional parameters:

   ptime:    see RFC4566[2]

   maxptime: see RFC4566[2]

   parameter is 44100, and 42.6(ms) when rate parameter is 48000. 
   If this parameter is not present, the sender MAY encapsulate a 
   maximum of 16 encoded frames into one RTP packet, in streaming 
   of ATRAC-X.

   maxRedundantFrames:  The maximum number of redundant frames that 
   may be sent during a session in any given packet under the redundant
   framing mechanism detailed in the draft. Allowed values are integers
   in the range 0 to 15, inclusive.  If this parameter is not used, a
   default of 15 MUST be assumed.

   delayMode:  Indicates a desire to use low-delay features, in which
   case the decoder will process received data accordingly based on 
   this value. Permissible values are 2 and 4.

   Encoding considerations:  This media type is framed and contains 
   binary data.

7.3  ATRAC Advanced Lossless Media type Registration

   The media subtype for the Adaptive TRansform Codec Lossless version
   (ATRAC Advanced Lossless) uses the template defined in RFC 4855 [6].

   Note, any unknown parameter MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Type name:  audio

   Subtype name:  atrac-advanced-lossless

   different from that proposed in RFC 3551 [3].  However, as channelID
   = 0 defines an ambiguous channel layout, the channel mapping defined
   in Section 4.1 of [3] could be used.  Permissible values are 0, 1, 2,
   3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

   ptime:    see RFC4566[2]

   maxptime: see RFC4566[2]
   In streaming of ATRAC Advanced Lossless, a multiple frames can 
   not be transmitted in a single RTP packet, as the frame size 
   is large. So it SHOULD be regarded as the time of one encoded 
   frame in both of the sender and the reciever side. 
   The value of the parameter MUST be 11.5, 23.2 or 46.4(ms).

   Encoding considerations: This media type is framed and contains 
   binary data.

   Security considerations:  See Section 9 of this document.

   Interoperability considerations: none

7.5  Mapping Media type Parameters into SDP

   The information carried in the Media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [2], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is
   used to specify sessions employing the ATRAC family of codecs, the
   following mapping rules according to the ATRAC codec apply:

7.5.1  For Media subtype ATRAC3

   o  The Media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name

   o  The Media subtype (payload format name) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as
      the encoding name.  ATRAC3 supports only mono or stereo signals,
      so a corresponding number of channels SHALL also be included in
      this attribute.

   o  The "baseLayer" parameter goes in SDP "a=fmtp".  This parameter
      MUST be present. "maxRedundantFrames" may follow, but if no value
      is transmitted, the receiver SHOULD assume a default value of
      "15".

   o  The parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP "a=ptime" and
      "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.

7.5.2  For Media subtype ATRAC-X

   o  The Media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name

   o  The Media subtype (payload format name) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as
      the encoding name.  This should be followed by the "sampleRate"
      (as the RTP clock rate), and then the actual number of channels
      regardless of the channelID parameter.

   o  The parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP "a=ptime" and
      "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.

   o  Any remaining parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by
      copying them directly from the Media type string as a
      semicolon separated list of parameter=value pairs.  The
      "baseLayer" parameter must be the first entry on this line.  It is
      recommened that the "channelID" parameter be the next entry.  The
      receiver MUST assume a default value of "15" for
      "maxRedundantFrames".

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-ietf-avt-rtp-atrac-family-13.txt    January, 2008


7.5.3  For Media subtype ATRAC Advanced Lossless

   o  The Media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name

   o  The Media subtype (payload format name) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as
      the encoding name.  This should be followed by the "sampleRate"
      (as the RTP clock rate), and then the actual number of channels
      regardless of the channelID parameter.

   o  The parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP "a=ptime" and
      "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.

   o  Any remaining parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by
      copying them directly from the Media type string as a
      semicolon separated list of parameter=value pairs. 
      On this line, the parameters "baseLayer" and "blockLength" 
      MUST be existing in this order.
      The value of "blockLength" MUST be one of 1024 and 2048, for
      using ATRAC3 and ATRAC-X as baselayer, respectively.
      If "baseLayer=0" (means standard mode), "blockLength" MUST be one
      of either 512, 1024, or 2048. It is recommended that the
      "channelID" parameter be the next entry.  The receiver MUST assume
      a default value of "15" for "maxRedundantFrames".

7.6  Offer-Answer Model Considerations

   Some options for encoding and decoding ATRAC audio data will require
   either or both the sender and receiver to comply with certain
   specifications.  In order to establish an interoperable transmission
   framework, an Offer-Answer negotiation in SDP should observe the
   following considerations. (See reference [10].):

7.6.1  For All Three Media Subtypes

   o  Each combination of the RTP payload transport format configuration
      parameters (baseLayer and blockLength, sampleRate, channelID) is
      unique in its bit-pattern and not compatible with any other
      combination.  When creating an offer in an application desiring to
      use the more advanced features (sample rates above 44100kHz, more
      than two channels), the offerer is RECOMMENDED to also offer a
      payload type containing only the lowest set of necessary
      requirements.  If multiple configurations are of interest to the
      application they may all be offered, however care should be taken
      not to offer too many payload types.

   o  The parameters "maxptime" and "ptime" will in most cases not
      affect interoperability, however the setting of the parameters can
      affect the performance of the application.  The SDP offer-answer
      handling of the "ptime" parameter is described in RFC3264.  The
      "maxptime" parameter MUST be handled in the same way.

7.6.2  For Media subtype ATRAC3

   o  In response to an offer, downgraded subsets of "baseLayer" are
      possible.  However for best performance, we suggest the answer
      contain the highest possible values offered.





















Hatanaka, et al.                                               [Page 26]

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-ietf-avt-rtp-atrac-family-13.txt    January, 2008


7.6.3  For Media subtype ATRAC-X

   o  When creating an offer with considerably high requirements (such
      as 8 channels at 96kHz), it is RECOMMENDED that the offer also
      contain a configuration with lower requirements (such as a stereo
      only option).  Although multiple alternative configurations may be
      offered, care should be taken not to offer too many payload types.

   o  In response to an offer, downgraded subsets of "sampleRate",
      "baseLayer", and "channelID" are possible.  For best performance,
      we suggest an answer SHALL NOT contain any values requiring
      further capabilities than the offer contains, but is RECOMMENDED
      to provide values as close as possible to those in the offer.

   o  The "maxRedundantFrames" is a suggested minimum.  This value MAY
      be increased in an answer (with a maximum of 15), but SHALL NOT be
      reduced.

   o  The optional parameter "delayMode" is non-negotiable.  If the
      Answerer cannot comply with the offered value, the session must be
      deemed inoperable.

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-ietf-avt-rtp-atrac-family-13.txt    January, 2008


7.6.4  For Media subtype ATRAC Advanced Lossless

   o  When creating an offer with considerably high requirements (such
      as 8 channels at 96kHz), it is RECOMMENDED that the offer also
      contain a configuration with lower requirements (such as a stereo
      only option).  Although multiple alternative configurations may be
      offered, care should be taken not to offer too many payload types.

   o  In response to an offer, downgraded subsets of "sampleRate",
      "baseLayer", and "channelID" are possible.  For best performance,
      we suggest an answer SHALL NOT contain any values requiring
      further capabilities than the offer contains, but is RECOMMENDED
      to provide values as close as possible to those in the offer.

   o  There are no requirements when negotiating "blockLength", other
      than that both parties must be in agreement.

   o  The "maxRedundantFrames" is a suggested minimum.  This value MAY
      be increased in an answer (with a maximum of 15), but SHALL NOT be
      reduced.

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-ietf-avt-rtp-atrac-family-13.txt    January, 2008


7.7  Usage of declarative SDP

   In declarative usage, like SDP in RTSP [11] or SAP [12], the
   parameters SHALL be interpreted as follows:

   o  The payload format configuration parameters (baseLayer,
      sampleRate, channelID) are all declarative and a participant MUST
      use the configuration(s) that is provided for the session.  More
      than one configuration may be provided if necessary by declaring
      multiple RTP payload types, however the number of types should be
      kept small.

   o  Any "maxptime" and "ptime" values should be selected with care to
      ensure that the session's participants can achieve reasonable
      performance.

   For transmission of scaleble multi-session streaming of ATRAC 
   ADVANCED LOSSLESS content,the attribute of media stream 
   identification, group information and decoding dependency between
   baselayer stream and enhancement layer stream MUST be signalled in
   SDP. In this case, the attribute of "mid", "group" and "depend"
   followed by appropriate parameter SHALL be used in SDP[7][8].

7.8  Example SDP Session Descriptions

7.9  Example Offer-Answer Exchange

   The following Offer/Answer example shows how a desire to stream
   multi-channel content is turned down by the receiver, who answers
   with only the ability to receive stereo content:

   Offer:

   m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 98 99
   a=rtpmap:98 ATRAC-X/44100/6
   a=fmtp:98 baseLayer=320; channelID=5
   a=rtpmap:99 ATRAC-X/44100/6
   a=fmtp:99 baseLayer=160; channelID=5

   Answer:

   m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 99
   a=rtpmap:99 ATRAC-X/44100/2
   a=fmtp:99 baseLayer=160; channelID=2

   The following Offer/Answer example shows the receiver answering with
   a selection of supported parameters:

   Offer:

   m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 97 98 99
   a=rtpmap:97 ATRAC-X/44100/2
   a=fmtp:97 baseLayer=128; channelID=2
   a=rtpmap:98 ATRAC-X/44100/6
   a=fmtp:98 baseLayer=128; channelID=5
   a=rtpmap:99 ATRAC-X/48000/6
   a=fmtp:99 baseLayer=320; channelID=5

   Answer:

   m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 97 98
   a=rtpmap:97 ATRAC-X/44100/2
   a=fmtp:97 baseLayer=128; channelID=2
   a=rtpmap:98 ATRAC-X/44100/6
   a=fmtp:98 baseLayer=128; channelID=5

   The following Offer/Answer example shows an exchange in trying to
   resolve using ATRAC-Advanced-Lossless.  The offer contains three
   options: multi-session High-Speed Transfer mode, multiplexed High-
   Speed Transfer mode, and Standard mode.

   Note that payload format (encoding) names are commonly shown in 
   upper case.  Media subtypes are commonly shown in lower case.  
   These names are case-insensitive in both places.  Similarly, 
   parameter names are case-insensitive both in Media types and in 
   the default mapping to the SDP a=fmtp attribute.

   Certain security precautions may be desired to protect copyrighted
   material.  The payload format as described in this document is
   subject to the security considerations defined in RFC3550 [1] and 
   any applicable profile, for example RFC 3551 [3]. Also the security 
   of media type registration MUST be taken into account as described 
   in section 5 of RFC 4855[6]. This payload format however does not 
   implement any security mechanisms of its own. External means, 
   such as SRTP [9], MAY be used since the audio compression scheme 
   follows an end-to-end model.  Since the data transported is audio 
   that is already encoded, the main security issues are 
   confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of the actual audio.

9.1  Confidentiality

   To ensure confidentiality of ATRAC encoded audio, the audio frames
   will have to be encrypted.  Encryption of the payload header,
   however, is not as neccessary, and in fact may not be preferrable if
   the information could be useful to some third party application.

   Because the audio compression scheme follows an end-to-end model,
   encryption may be performed after packet encapsulation.  As multi-
   channel transmissions are contained in single encoded audio frames,
   there is no concern for encryption affecting interleaving data.

9.2  Authentication

   Transmitted data may be tampered or altered due malicious attempts,
   such as man-in-the-middle attacks.  Such attacks may result in
   depacketization and/or decoding errors that could decimate audio
   quality.

   As this payload format does not include its own means for sender
   authentication and integrity protection, an external mechanism must
   be used.  It is RECOMMENDED, however, that the chosen mechanism
   protect more than just the audio data bits.  For example, to 
   protect against a man-in-the-middle attack, the payload header and 
   RTP header SHOULD be protected.

9.3  Decoding Validation

   Verification of the received encoded audio packets should be
   performed so as to ensure a minimal level of audio quality.  As a
   most primitive implementation, if the receiver calculates a packet
   size differing from the payload length based on data in the payload
   header fields, the receiver SHOULD discard the packet.
