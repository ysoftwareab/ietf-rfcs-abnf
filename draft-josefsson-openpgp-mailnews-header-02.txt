Internet-Draft      The OpenPGP mail and news header      September 2005


1.  Preface

   This document is intended to define the "OpenPGP" message header.
   This header should be considered "informational" (and "optional"),
   and be suitable for both mail [8] and netnews [1] messages.  This
   header should be used to provide information about the sender's
   OpenPGP [7] key.  This header MAY be used in any message.

   This document should be interpreted within the context of RFC 2822.
   In the event of a discrepancy, refer to that document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].


2.  Background and Motivation

   There are quite a few PGP and GnuPG users who add headers with
   information about the sender's OpenPGP key.  Headers in current use
   include "X-PGP:", "X-PGP-Key:", "X-Request-PGP:", "X-PGP-KeyID:", and
   "X-PGP-Fingerprint:".  The headers lack standardization, which
   prevent them from being reliably parsed automatically by
   applications, rather than manually parsed by humans.

   Since both PGP and GnuPG rely on the OpenPGP protocol, it appear
   preferable to use the term "OpenPGP" rather than "PGP", or "GPG", in
   the header name.  The latter forms appear as underhanded attempts to
   advocate specific applications, rather than the open standard they
   both share.  The header specified here is named "OpenPGP".

   The OpenPGP header is not a required part of successful use of
   OpenPGP in e-mail.  It is intended as a convenience, in those
   situations where the user experience may be enhanced by using the
   information in this header.  Consequently, the information in this
   header should not disrupt the normal OpenPGP key retrieval and web of
   trust mechanism.  Neither the integrity nor the authenticity of the
   information in this header should be assumed to be correct or be
   trust-worthy.

   No specific scenario when the header should be used, nor how it
   should be used in that scenario, are suggested by this document.  It
   is acknowledged that the dominant use of the information in this
   header may be by humans and not applications.

   To promote good use of this header, care should be taken so that
   applications do not trigger error messages that may annoy the user,
   when an error condition arise during handling of the OpenPGP header.

Internet-Draft      The OpenPGP mail and news header      September 2005


   It is generally recommended that an implementation ignore the
   presence of the OpenPGP header if an error condition occur.  Since
   the header is optional, this approach should not be difficult to
   implement.  The philosophy here is to enable an enhanced user
   experience.  Error messages rarely contribute to that goal.


3.  OpenPGP Header Field

   This header is intended to present characteristics of the sender's
   OpenPGP key.  It may contain the Key ID and the URL where the key can
   be retrieved.

   This header is of a "structured" type (see section 2.2.2 of RFC
   2822).  In general, the structure consist of one or more parameters,
   each consisting of one attribute and one value.  The terminology and
   format of the header was inspired by MIME [2].  The various
   provisions of RFC 2045 apply.  In particular, the value part of all
   parameters may be quoted; whitespace, foldoing and comments may occur
   in the middle of parameters.  The provisions of MIME [3] also apply;
   in particular it deals with handling parameters of excessive length.

   In the Augmented BNF [5] notation, an OpenPGP header field is defined
   as below.  By itself, however, this grammar is incomplete.  It refers
   by name to several syntax rules that are defined by RFC 2822 and the
   URI syntax document [6].  Rather than reproduce those definitions
   here, and risk unintentional differences between the two, this
   document refer the reader to RFC 2822 and RFC 2396 for the definition
   of non-terminals.

   Unrecognized parameters MUST be ignored.  The grammar permit them to
   allow for future extensions.  This header SHOULD NOT appear more than
   once within a message.  A given parameter type (i.e., "id", "url" or
   "preference") MUST NOT occur more than once.

   openpgp    :=  "OpenPGP:"
                  (openpgp-parameter *(";" openpgp-parameter))
                  CRLF

   id         := *HEXDIG

   url        := absoluteURI  ; Defined in RFC 2396.

   preference := "sign" / "encrypt" / "signencrypt" / "unprotected"

   openpgp-parameter
              := ("id" "=" id) /
                 ("url" "=" url) /
                 ("preference" "=" preference) /
                 parameter   ; See RFC 2045 for definition of parameter.

3.1.  Primary Key ID field: id

   The "id" attribute=value pair, if present, MUST define the primary
   key ID.  The value MUST identify the key ID (in either short or long
   form) or the fingerprint, all using the hexadecimal [14] notation.

   The length of the field imply the kind of key id, i.e., short or long
   form, or a v3 or v4 key.

   Note that each of the following examples includes a comment, which is
   optional.

       id=12345678 (short key ID)
       id=1234567890ABCDEF (long key ID)
       id=1234567890abcdef01234567890ABCDEF0123456 (v4 fingerprint)
       id=1234567890ABCDEF01234567890ABCDE (v3 fingerprint, deprecated)

3.2.  Key URL field: url

   The "url" attribute=value pair, if present, MUST specify a URL where
   the public key can be found.  It is RECOMMENDED to use a common URL
   family, such as HTTP [12] or FTP [9].  The URL MUST be fully
   qualified, MUST explicitly specify a protocol and SHOULD be
   accessible on the public Internet.

   For example:

       url=http://example.org/pgp.txt

Internet-Draft      The OpenPGP mail and news header      September 2005


3.3.  Protection Preference Field: preference

   The "preference" attribute=value pair, if present, specify the
   quality of protection preferred by the sender.  The available choices
   are "unprotected" which means that the sender prefer not to receive
   OpenPGP protected e-mails.  A "sign" token means that the sender
   prefer to receive digitally signed e-mails.  A "encrypt" token means
   that the sender prefer to receive digitally encrypted e-mails.  A
   "signencrypt" token means that the sender prefer to receive digitally
   encrypted and signed e-mails.  Note that there is no technical
   requirement on the receiver to follow the stated preference.

   For example:

       preference=sign
       preference="unprotected"
       preference=ENCRYPT


4.  Comments

   As discussed in section 3.2.3 of RFC 2822, comments may appear in
   header field bodies.  Comments are not intended to be interpreted by
   any application, but to provide additional information for humans.

   The following are examples of header field bodies with comments:

     id=B565716F (key stored on non-networked laptop)
     id=12345678 (1024 bit RSA Key for Encrypt or Sign)
     id=ABCD0123 (created Sun Jan  2 02:25:15 CET 2005)


5.  Examples

   These are valid examples of ways in which this header may be used.
   This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but do reflect expected
   typical usages.

     OpenPGP: id=12345678
     OpenPGP: url=http://example.com/key.txt
     OpenPGP: preference=unprotected
     OpenPGP: url=http://example.com/key.txt; id=12345678
     OpenPGP: id=12345678; url=http://example.com/key.txt;
              preference=signencrypt
     OpenPGP: url=http://example.com/key.txt (down 2-3pm UTC);
              id=12345678 (this key is only used at the office);
              preference=sign (unsigned emails are filtered away)

6.  Open Issues

   Should there be a "supports" field, that signal whether the sender
   support inline PGP or PGP/MIME?  As in supports="inline, mime" or
   similar.  Should it be in preferred priority order?  This draft
   tentatively closes this issue by ignoring the matter, until someone
   proposes text.

   The ABNF definition is known to be under-specified.


7.  Acknowledgements

   The content of this document builds on discussions with (in
   alphabetical order) Christian Biere, Patrick Brunschwig, Jon Callas,

   Lindsey, Aleksandar Milivojevic, Xavier Maillard, Greg Sabino
   Mullane, Thomas Roessler, Moritz Schulte, Olav Seyfarth, Thomas
   Sjogren, Paul Walker, and Steve Youngs.  No doubt the list is
   incomplete.  We apologize to anyone we left out.


8.  Security Considerations

   These headers are intended to be a convenience in locating public
   keys: They are neither secure nor intended to be.  Since header
   information is easy to spoof, information contained in headers should
   not be trusted: The information must be verified.  How the
   information is verified is left as an exercise for the reader.

   Applications that interpret the data within this header MUST NOT
   assume that the data is correct, and MUST NOT present the data to the
   user in any way that would cause the user to assume that it is
   correct.  Applications that interpret the data within this header
   SHOULD alert the user that this information is not a substitute for
   personally verifying keys and being a part of the web of trust.

   If an application receives a signed message and uses the information
   in this header to retrieve a key, the application MAY ignore the
   retrieved key if it is not the same key used to sign the message.
   This SHOULD be done before the newly retrieved key is imported into
   the user's keyring.

   The use of HTTPS [13], DNSSEC [10], SMTP STARTTLS [11], and other
   secure protocols, may enhance the security of information conveyed
   through this header, but does not guarantee any level of security or
   authenticity.  Developers and users must remain aware of this.

   Version 3 OpenPGP keys can be created with a chosen key id (aka "the
   0xDEADBEEF attack").  Verifying the Key ID of a retrived key against
   the one provided in this header is thus not sufficient to protect
   against a man-in-the-middle attack.  Instead, the web-of-trust
   mechanism should be used.

   If an attacker wants to check the validity of Email addresses, he
   might send out junk email to arbitrary addresses and collect those
   that report back to the crafted OpenPGP URL.  To protect against
   this, implementations MUST inform the user of that potential privacy
   issue when retrieving keys from an URL provided by the mail headers
   of an inbound email message: either when the feature is enabled or to
   be used for the first time or every time the MUA detects an unknown
   key.

   Given the flexibility of the syntax of the header, slightly varying
   the content between messages can be used as a covert channel.


9.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is asked to register the OpenPGP header, using the template
   as follows, in accordance with RFC 3864 [15].

   Header field name: OpenPGP

   Applicable protocol: mail, netnews

   Status: informational

   Author/Change controller: IETF

   Specification document(s): This document.

   Related information: None
