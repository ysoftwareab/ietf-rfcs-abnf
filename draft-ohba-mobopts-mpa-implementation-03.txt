Internet-Draft             MPA Implementation               October 2006


1.  Introduction

   Media-independent Pre-Authentication (MPA), is a new handover
   optimization mechanism that provides mobility optimization that is
   decoupled from existing mobility management schemes.  It is designed
   to support a mobile terminal with one or more interfaces and is
   capable of securely crossing administrative domains.  It also easily
   integrates with existing mobility management protocols.  The MPA
   architecture is described in [I-D.ohba-mobopts-mpa-framework].

   This document accompanies MPA architectural document [I-D.ohba-
   mobopts-mpa-framework] and it provides practical methods of
   implementing MPA.  It also describes performace results gathered from
   these implementations and can clearly show how one can use existing
   protocols to provide MPA functionality.  The succeeding sections also
   describe specific scenarios where both MPA and non-MPA approaches are
   evaluated and results of their comparison are described.

2.  Network Topology of MPA Testbed

   For the MPA evaluation, two(2) testbeds where developed each using a
   different mobility management protocol (MMP).  The first
   implementation uses Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) and the second uses SIP
   Mobility (SIP-M).  The results of the test from both testbeds are
   described in the succeeding chapters.  These results are also
   compared against a non-MPA scenario and describes the advantages of
   using MPA.

2.1.  MPA Testbed using Mobile IPv6

   The initial MPA testbed uses Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) to facilitate
   mobility management functions between Mobile Node (MN) and the
   Correspondent Node (CN).  Figure 1 describes the basic topology for
   the MPA testbed using MIPv6.

   There are four networks.  Network 1 is the old point of attachment
   (oPoA) where the mobile node (MN) intially resides prior to handover,
   Network 2 is new point of attachment (nPoA) where the MN is moving
   towards, Network 3 is where the correspondent node (CN) resides and

   finally Network 4 is where the Home Agent (HA) resides.  All networks
   need not be adjacent.  However, in the testbed each network is one IP
   hope away from each other.  IPv6 addressing schemes are used in all
   networks and prefixes are statically configured to reduce complexity.
   As an initial state, the CN starts communicating with the MN while
   the MN is in Network 1 by sending streaming (RTP) traffic towrds the
   MN via HA within the MIPv6 tunnel.  During handoff, the MIPv6 takes
   care of the IP continuity of the RTP traffic.  Details of the
   topology of is as follows.

   1.  Network 1

       *  Router 1 (R1) - IPv6 Gateway to Network 1 and reachable via
          Network 2 and Network 4.

       *  Access Point 1 (AP1) - 802.11 WLAN Access Point acting as oPoA
          of the MN

   2.  Network 2

       *  Router 2 (R2) - IPv6 Gateway to Network 2 and reachable via
          Network 1 and Network 3.  It has a co-located Authentication
          Agent (AA) using PANA PAA (PAA), [I-D.ietf-pana-pana].  Packet
          buffering is also available in R2 to assist during handover.
          When packet buffering is used during handover, packet loss is
          averted.

       *  Access Point 2 (AP2) - 802.11 WLAN Access Point acting as nPoA
          for the MN

   3.  Network 3

       *  Correspondent Node (CN) - IPv6 source of voice/ streaming
          traffic via RTP/UDP using the RAT (Robust Audio Tool) media
          agent.

   4.  Network 4

       *  Mobile IPv6 Home Agent (HA) - MIPv6 Home Agent (HA)
          responsible for IPv6 source of voice/ streaming traffic via
          RTP/UDP using the RAT (Robust Audio Tool) media agent.

   5.  MN

       *  MIPv6 mobile node (MN) - MN that binds with the HA in Network
          3.It uses an 802.11 WLAN optimized interface driver for
          handover.  There is also an optinal kernel based network
          buffer for packet loss protection.

   In MIPv6, the MN creates an IPv6-IPv6 tunnel with the HA as part of
   the mobility management.  With the addition of MPA, a proactive
   handover tunnel is additionally created between the MN and R2 in
   Network 2.  In the testbed, this tunnel is based on IPsec tunnel mode
   ESP and PANA is used for dynamically establishing and terminating the
   IPsec tunnel.  Note that for simplicity, the required cipher keys for
   IPsec tunnel mode ESP are pre-configured on the MN and R2.  Though
   IKE was not used for establishing the IPsec tunnel mode ESP in the
   test scenario, use of IKE before the handover will not impact on the
   overall scheme.  As part of the MPA scheme, the MIPv6 tunnel traffic
   between the MN and HA goes through the IPsec tunnel created by MPA
   with appropriate IPsec policy settings.  In the testbed, the required
   IPsec policy parameters including nCoA are also carried in PANA
   messages.  Details of the MPA message flows is shown in Figure 2.

   Figure 2: MPA Communication Flow in the Test Environment with MIPv6

   As an initial state the MN associates itself with AP 1.  It
   configures based on a statically configure prefix.  This IP address
   is the old Care of Address (oCoA) that is sent to the HA via the
   initial Binding Update (BU).  Voice traffic then initiated from CN to
   MN via the HA (inside the MIPv6 tunnel).  The voice traffic is
   carried over RTP/UDP using the RAT (Robust Audio Tool) media agent.

   MPA process starts when the MN pre-authenticates with Network 2.
   This step is similar to SIP-Mobility Section 2.2 and shows the
   generic application of pre-authentication with any mobility
   management scheme.  Pre-authentication can be triggered by some
   localized policy that includes monitoring the MN's signal strength or



Fajardo (Ed.), et al.    Expires April 25, 2007                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             MPA Implementation               October 2006


   maybe an indication of "link going down" event [802.21].  In the pre-
   authentication procedure (Step 1 of Figure 2, the MN prepares for
   link-layer handover and obtains all relevant information about the
   target network.  After successful completion of the pre-
   authentication procedure, an MPA SA is established between the MN and
   AA in Network 2.  In the MIPv6 tested, information about the target
   network is also obtained in Step 1.  Note that in the testbed these
   information are locally stored on the MN before starting the pre-
   authentication procedure.

   In step 2, the pre-configuration procedure is executed to configure
   parameters required for communicating via Network 2.  Such parameters
   include nCoA and are communicated back via PANA messaging.  As part
   of the MIPv6 functions, the MN sends a BU to HA to update the
   mobility binding.  Once HA is updated, MIPv6 will use nCoA and
   traffic will flow via Network 2.  Since the MN and R2 are aware of
   nCoA, it is also used during the establishment of the IPsec tunnel.
   The IPsec policies established between the MN and R2 will allow MIPv6
   traffic to be forwared through the IPsec tunnel.  This process is
   step 3 of Figure 2.

   When MPA setup is completed, the MN can perform proactive secure
   handover.  The MN and R2 tear down the IPsec tunnel as part of this
   process and MN associates with AP 2.  Since the HA is already
   configured with the nCoA, the MN does not need to send a BU to the HA
   after handover.  R2 should naturally forwards traffic for the MN as
   it is managed by the HA.  The signalling of the movement between MN
   and R2 are also similar to the SIP-mobility scenario in that it uses
   PANA-Update-Request messages.

   As shown in Figure 2, there is potential packet loss during 'X'.  In
   the testbed, an optional packet buffering mechanism has been
   implemented to assist during handover.  Prior to handover, setp 4 in
   Figure 2, the MN signals R2 so that buffering of packets that is
   destined for the MN can begin.  So during the handover, R2 buffers
   all packets that is already in transit and has a destination of oCoA
   of the MN.  Once handover has successfully completed, the MN again
   signals R2 that it can end buffering of packets and forward any
   buffered packets to the MN at nCoA.  This mechanism guarantees no
   packet loss for incoming packet to the MN during the handover.  The
   results of MPA with and without buffering is shown in Section 4.  As
   shown in the results, adding buffering has a side effect of
   increasing overall delay because of additional signaling as well as
   delay caused by the act of buffering itself.  A source of delay can
   also be attributed to the fact that the packet sequence has to be
   maintained during forwarding of buffered packets so newly arrived
   packets has to wait until all buffered packets has been forwarded.

2.2.  MPA Testbed using SIP Mobility

   The second MPA testbed uses SIP Mobility (SIP-M) to facilitate
   mobility management functions between Mobile Node (MN) and the
   Correspondent Node (CN).  Figure 3 describes the basic topology for
   the MPA testbed using SIP-M.

   Figure 3: MPA Test Network using SIP Mobility

   The topology for the SIP Mobility (SIP-M) testbed is very similar to
   Figure 1.  The first three (3) networks have the same configuration
   except that IPv4 addressing is used and mobility management is done
   via SIP.  Also, IP addressing is based on DHCP Server assignments
   instead of static configurations.  In addition, Network 4 is not
   required since Home Agent (HA) is not present in the SIP-M tests.

       *  Router 2 (R2) - IPv4 Gateway to Network 2 and reachable via
          Network 1 and Network 3.  It has a co-located Authentication
          Agent (AA) using PANA PAA (PAA), [I-D.ietf-pana-pana] and a
          co-located DHCP relay-agent acting as Configuration Agent
          (CA), [RFC3046].  Packet buffering is also available in R2 to
          assist during handover.  When packet buffering is used during
          handover, packet loss is averted.

       *  DHCP Server 2 (DHCPs2) - IP addressing needs for Network 2.
          It's reachability is extended by the DHCP relay-agent in R2

       *  Access Point 2 (AP2) - 802.11 WLAN Access Point acting as nPoA
          for the MN

   3.  Network 3

       *  Correspondent Node (CN) - Co-located SIP Mobility Client and
          source of voice/streaming traffic via RTP/UDP using the RAT
          (Robust Audio Tool) media agent.

   4.  MN

       *  Co-located SIP Mobility Client that binds with the CN.  It
          uses an 802.11 WLAN optimized interface driver for handover.
          There is also an optinal kernel based network buffer for
          packet loss protection.

   To simplify the scenario, SIP proxies are not involved to set up the
   initial communication between the CN and MN.  Router 2 provides IP-
   in-IP tunneling [RFC1853] to facilitate routing to the MN while the
   MN is still in Network 1.  This is part of the MPA handover
   procedure.  The IP-in-IP tunnel will make it appear as though the MN
   is already in Network 2 and the streaming traffic will be forwarded
   via the tunnel.  Details of the MPA message flows is shown in
   Figure 4.

   Figure 4: MPA Communication Flow in the Test Environment with SIP-M

   As an initial state the MN associates itself with AP1 and obtains the
   IP address from DHCP Server 1 in Network 1.  The IP address obtained
   in Network 1 is the old Care of Address (oCoA).  To setup streaming
   traffic, the CN's SIP user agent attempts to connect with the MN's
   SIP user agent.  After a successful SIP connection, voice traffic is
   initiated from CN to MN.  The voice traffic is carried over RTP/UDP
   using the RAT (Robust Audio Tool) media agent.

Internet-Draft             MPA Implementation               October 2006


   MPA test starts when the MN pre-authenticates with Network 2.  This
   step can be triggered by some localized policy that includes
   monitoring the MN's signal strength or maybe an indication of "link
   going down" event [802.21].  In anycase, pre-authentication prepares
   the MN for the handover process by obtaining information about the
   target network.  Obtaining this information can be done via
   information servers that maybe present in a reachable network
   [802.21].  In the case of the testbed, information servers are not
   present to simplify the network topology.  Target network information
   are pre-defined within the MN to simulate a successful information
   server query.  Since the relevant information is available, the MN
   authenticates to the PAA and derives proper security keys and
   establishes a security association (SA) with the MN.  The pre-
   authentication process is step 1 of Figure 4.

   In step 2, the MN pre-configures with Network 2.  The MN performs
   pre-configuration by communicating with DHCP Proxy to obtain an IP
   address for Network 2.  Other implementation may require more than
   just the IP address.  In such a case, more information can pre-
   provisioned and can be communicated to the MN during this phase.  In
   the testbed, the DHCP proxy and Authentication Agent (AA) are co-
   located and the DHCP proxy provides IP assignment services to pre-
   authenticated MN's via DHCP Server 2.  The new IP address is relayed
   back to the MN as part of the PANA exchanges.  The newly obtained IP
   address is the new Care of Address (nCoA) and is usable in Network 2.
   Once the MN gets the nCoA, it can create an IP-in-IP tunnel with
   Router 2 of Network 2 and assign the nCoA as a virtual interface
   address of this tunnel.

   Once a tunnel is created, the MN performs proactive secure handover.
   Since the MN is configured with the nCoA, the MN can send a SIP Re-
   invite to CN with nCoA as its new contact address via the tunnel.  In
   the testbed, all traffic between CN and MN will be carried within the
   tunnel once SIP Re-invite completes.  This traffic includes the voice
   traffic initiated in the initial step.

   The remaining steps allow the MN to perform the actual secure
   proactive handover.  As the mobile detects the nPoA and makes a
   decision to switch over to Network 2 it starts association with AP 2.
   Once association completes successfully, the MN configures itself by
   tearing down the local tunnel end-point and re-assign the nCoA to the
   physical interface associated with AP 2.  In addition, it also
   updates its local default route information with that of Network 2.
   The MN then sends a PANA-Update-Request message to the access router
   R2.  The purpose of this message is to notify Router 2 to tear down
   its tunnel end-point.  The MN's ARP entry for nCoA is also be updated
   in R2 upon receipt of this message.  This reduces the delay due to
   ARP exchanges that usually happens when a new IP address is first

   used in a network.

   Similar to MIPv6 with MPA, a optional packet buffering exists in R2
   to assist with packet loss during handover.  The mechanism for
   buffering remains the same as with MIPv6 with MPA as described in
   Section 2.1.  The results of MIPv6 MPA with buffering is also shown
   in Section 4 and is consistent with MIPv6 results with buffering.

3.  Non-MPA Assisted Handover Scenario

   For the comparison purposes, non-MPA assisted handover is also
   described in this section.  The non-MPA scheme were tested using
   Figure 3.  Note that the expected behavior described in this section
   would be similar if the testbed used was Figure 1.  The non-MPA
   scheme does not provide any proactive handover mechanism and
   therefore follow a typical procedure for handover.  To make a good
   comparison with the MPA scenario, the MN boostraps itself in Network
   1 and obtains an oCoA from DHCP Server 1 in the non-MPA scenario.  In
   addition, it uses the same handover policy to decide when actual
   handover process should begin, i.e. signal strength or link layer
   down event.

   Once the policy indicates that handover should begin, the MN
   disassociates with AP 1 and associates with AP 2.  On successful
   association, it obtains an IP address (nCoA) from DHCP Server 2, then
   assigns that address to its physical interface.  During this period,
   no data can reach the MN.  Even after associating with AP 2, traffic
   towards the MN through Router 2 may not be allowed since the MN is
   not yet authenticated in Network 2.  So the authentication process
   becomes part of the overall handover and hence the additional delay.
   Only when the authentication is successful can packets be forwarded
   to the MN via Network 2.

   An additional requirement before packet forwarding can happen is to
   send binding updates to inform the CN of the MN's nCoA.  In the
   testbed, the MN sends SIP Re-invite with the nCoA and causes voice
   traffic to be forwarded via Network 2.  This process also adds delay
   and could have potentially taken an even longer amount of time if the
   MB's target network and the CN are far apart.

4.  Evaluation and Performance Results

   We have experimented MPA techniques for two types of heterogeneous
   handovers as defined in [I-D.ohba-mobopts-heterogeneous-requirement].
   We provide the details of two of these: I)Intra-technology, Inter-
   domain, II) Inter-technology, Inter-domain.  Section 4.1 discusses
   the results of case I whereas Section 4.2 discusses the results of
   case II.  We have also experimented with MPA to bootstrap layer 2
   security for both roaming and non-roaming cases.  In non-roaming case
   the mobile does not need to communicate with home AAA server during
   the EAP authentication, but in case of roaming mobile needs to
   communciate with AAA server.  Section 4.3 discusses the results
   obtained from MPA assisted layer 2 pre-authentication and compares
   these with EAP authentication and IEEE 802.11i's pre-authentication
   techniques.

4.1.  Intra-technology, Inter-domain

   Measurements taken from testbed Figure 1 are shown in Figure 6 and
   testbed Figure 3 are shown in Figure 7.  Measurements are based on
   the following common scenarios for both testbed and the values are
   mean values taken from three (3) test samples.

   o  AP 1 and AP 2 are 802.11b access points operating on separate
      channels.

   o  L2 handoff measurements are based on complete open mode
      association sequence.  Measurement is a mean value in millisecond.

   o  L3 handoff measurements are based on linux network layer
      configuration including routing table updates, neighbhor cache or
      ARP table updates and interface address assignment.  Measurement
      is a mean value in millisecond.

   o  Avg. packet loss is number of packets that failed to reach the MN
      during L2 and L3 handoff periods.  Measurement is a mean value.

   o  Avg. inter-packet arrival interval is the average time interval
      between each RTP packets as they arrive in the MN.  The
      measurement is taken from the MN.  This value mostly reflects the
      RTP packet generation rate in the CN where RTP traffic comes from.
      However, it should also include the propagation time from CN to MN
      including tunneling (MIPv6 and IPsec) but this propagation time is
      orders of magnitude smaller than the packet generation rate.  The
      measured value of this is 16 msec.

   o  Avg. inter-packet arrival time during handover is the amount of
      time in msec between the last RTP packet received by the MN before



Fajardo (Ed.), et al.    Expires April 25, 2007                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft             MPA Implementation               October 2006


      handover and the first RTP packet received by the MN after
      handover.  This will include the binding update signaling (SIP and
      MIPv6) as well as any buffer signaling.  Measurement is a mean
      value in millisecond.

   o  Avg. packet jitter is the avg. inter-packet arrival time during
      handover minus the expected avg. inter-packet arrival interval.
      This provides a measurement of the avg. additional delay incurred
      because of the handover process.

   o  R2 Buffering is an optional mechanism in the router to perform IP
      packet buffering on behalf of the MN during handoff period.  It is
      a measure of the length of the buffering period.  Measurement is a
      mean value in millisecond.

   o  Buffered packets is the number of packets buffered and eventually
      forwarded to the MN after handoff.  This is available only if
      buffering is enabled.

   o  Non-critical portions of the process is omitted such as pre-
      authorization.  Such process can be implemented in any network
      infrastructure though it is not critical for the purpose of
      handover measurements.

   o  Pre-athentication protocol used is PANA to establish SA between MN
      and Network 2.  Also, handover signaling information is carried by
      PANA messages after successful pre-authentication.

   o  RO is MIPv6 route optimiziation where the CN sends RTP packets
      directly to the MN's nCoA bypassing the HA.

   o  All IP nodes in both testbed uses linux 2.6.x with Helsinkin
      University of Technology (HUT) implementation of Mobile IPv6.

   The results for MIPv6 and SIP mobility are shown in Figure 6 and
   Figure 7, respectively.

   Figure 7: SIP Mobility with MPA Results

   For all measurement, we did not experience any performance
   degradation during handover in terms of the audio quality of the
   voice traffic.

   With the use of buffering during handover, packet loss during the
   actual L2 and L3 handover is eliminated with an appropriate and
   reasonable settings of buffering period for both MIP6 and SIP
   mobility.  In the case of MIP6, there is not a significant difference
   in results with and without route optimization.  It should be noted
   that results with more samples would be necessary to do more detailed
   analysis.

   In case of non-MPA assisted handover, handover delay and associated
   packet loss occurs from the moment the link-layer handover procedure
   begins up to successful processing of the binding update.  During
   this process, IP address acquisitions via DHCP incurs the longest
   delay.  This is due to the detection of duplicate of IP address in
   the network before DHCP request completes.  Binding update exchange
   also experiences long delay if the CN is too far from the MN.  As a
   result, the Non-MPA assisted handover took an average of 4 seconds to

   complete with an approximate packet loss of about 200 packets.  The
   measurement is based on the same traffic rate and traffic source as
   the MPA assisted handover.

4.2.  Inter-technology, Inter-domain

   Handoff involving heterogeneous access can take place in many
   different ways.  We limit the experiment to two interface and
   therefore results in several possible setup scenarios depending upon
   the activity of the second interface.  In one scenario, the second
   interface comes up when the link to the first interface goes down.
   This is a reactive scenario usually gives rise to undesirable packet
   loss and handoff delay.  In a second scenario, the second interface
   is being prepared while the mobile still communicates using the old
   interface (Sec 5.8.2 of accompanying document).  Preparation of the
   second interface should include setup of all the required state and
   security associations (e.g., PPP state, LCP, CHAP).  Such lengthly
   process is established ahead of time, it reduces the time taken for
   the secondary interface to be attached to the network.  After
   preparation, the mobile can decides to use the second interface as
   the active interface.  This results in less packet loss as it uses
   make-before-break techniques.  This is a proactive scenario and can
   have two(2) flavors.  The first is where both interfaces are up and
   the second is when only the old interface is up the prepared
   interface is brougth up only when handoff is about to occur.  This
   scenario may be beneficial from a battery management standpoint.
   Devices that operate two interfaces simultaneously can rapidly
   deplete their batteries.  However, by activating the second interface
   only after an appropriate network has been selected may utilize
   battery effectively.  Information discovery and MPA remain the same
   as in Section 5.1 with intra-technology handover.  In this experiment
   we add new optimization techniques such as faster link down detection
   mechanism and a copy-forwarding technique at the access router to
   help reduce transient packet loss during the handover.  Detailed
   discussion of faster link down detection and copy-forwarding
   mechanisms are out of scope for the current document.

   As compared to non-optimized handover that may result in delay up to
   18 sec and 1000 packet loss during handover from WLAN to CDMA, we
   were able to achieve 0 packet loss, and 50 ms handoff delay between
   the last pre-handoff pa We have experimented iwtcket and first in-
   handoff packet.  This handoffelay includes the time due to link down
   detection and time needed to delete the tunnel after the mobile has
   moved.  However we observed about 10 duplicate packets because of the
   copy-forwarding mechanism at the access routers.  But these duplicate
   packets are usually handled easily by the upper layer protocols.

4.3.  MPA-assisted Layer 2 pre-authentication

   MPA framework draft [xref target=I.D.ohba-mobopts-mpa-framework'/>
   discusses about the mechanism of bootstrapping layer two
   authentication in the neighboring access networks where the mobile is
   impending to move.  We describe the mechanism briefly here.
   Initially, during the discovery phase, MN discovers through some
   means the target AP and PAA's IP address that manages the target AP.
   Then MN pre-establishes a PANA Security Association (SA) (pre-
   authentication phase) with the candidate access network (CTN) via its
   existing network by performing an EAP exchange between MN and PAA.
   PAA could rely on a backend AAA server to carry out an EAP
   authentication method.  Then MN obtains configuration information
   that allows it to participate in the new network.  From MSK (used as
   a root key), PAA can derive a distinct PSK per AP.  PAA installs
   these keys in those APs (pre-configuration phase), and provide MN
   with the required information (APs MAC addresses) to generate the
   same PSKs.  Then MN moves to the AP and, after association, runs a
   4-way handshake by using the PSKap generated during PANA pre-
   authentication.  At this point the handoff is complete.  Thus, by
   pre-authenticating and pre-configuring the link, the security
   association establishment during handoff reduces to 4-way handshake
   only.  We then provide the details of the experimental setup and
   compare these results with IEEE 802.11i pre-authentication.  Figure 8
   shows the experimental testbed where we have conducted the MPA-
   assisted pre-auth experiment.

   Figure 8: Experimental Testbed for MPA-assisted L2 Pre-authentication

   We have experimented with three types of movement scenarios involving
   both roaming and non-roaming cases using the testbed shown in figure
   8.  In roaming case, MN is visiting in a domain different than its
   home domain.  Consequently, the AAAh needs to be contacted which is
   placed in a far from the visiting domain.  For the non-roaming case,
   we assume the MN is moving within its home domain and only local AAA
   server (AAAv) is contacted.  First scenario does not involve any pre-

   authentication.  MN is initially connected to AP0 and moves to AP1.
   Because neither network-layer authentication is enabled nor IEEE
   802.11i pre-authentication is used, MN needs to engage in a full EAP
   authentication with AP1 to gain access to the network after the move
   (post-authentication).  This experiment shows the effect of absence
   of any kind of pre-authentication.  Second scenario involves 802.11i
   pre-authentication and involves movement between AP1 and AP2.  MN is
   initially connected to AP2, and starts IEEE 802.11i pre-
   authentication with AP1.  This is an ideal scenario to compare the
   values obtained from 802.11i pre-authentication with that of network-
   layer assisted pre-authentication.  Both first and this second
   scenarios use RADIUS as AAA protocol (APs implements a RADIUS
   client).  Third scenario takes advantage of network layer assisted
   link-layer pre-authentication.  It involves movement between two APs
   (e.g., between AP0 and AP1) that belong to two different subnets
   where 802.11i pre-authentication is not possible.  Here, Diameter is
   used as AAA protocol (PAA implements a Diameter client).  In this
   third movement scenario, MN is initially connected to AP0.  MN starts
   PANA pre-authentication with the PAA which is co-located on the AR in
   the new candidate target network (nAR in network A) from the current
   associated network (network B).  After authentication, PAA installs
   two keys, PSKap1 and PSKap2 in both AP1 and AP2 respectively by using
   a pre-emptive key installation method.  Finally because PSKap1 is
   already installed, AP1 starts immediately the 4-way handshake.  We
   have used measurement tools such as ethereal and kismet to analyze
   the measurements for the 4-way handshake and PANA authentication.
   These measurements reflect different operations involved during
   network-layer pre-authentication.  In our experiment, as part of the
   discovery phase, we assume that the MN is able to retrieve PAAs IP
   address and all required information about AP1 and AP2 (e.g. channel,
   security-related parameters, etc.) at some point before the handover.
   This avoids the scanning during link-layer handoff.  We have applied
   this assumption to all three scenarios.  Because our focus is on
   reducing the time spent on authentication part during handoff, we do
   not discuss the details of how we avoid the scanning.

   Figure 9: Results of MPA-assisted Layer 2 results

   Figure 9 shows the timing (rounded off to the most significant
   number) associated with some of the handoff operations we have
   measured in the testbed.  We describe each of the timing below.
   Tauth refers to the execution of EAP-TLS authentication.  This time
   does not distinguish whether this authentication was performed during
   pre-authentication or a typical post-authentication.

   Tconf refers to time spent during PSK generation and installation
   after EAP authentication is complete.  In case of network-layer pre-
   authentication is not used, this time is not considered.

   Tassociation+4way refers to the time dedicated to the completion of
   association and the 4-way handshake with the target AP after the
   handoff.

4.4.  FMIPv6 and MPA performance comparison

   MPA and proactive FMIPv6 provide fast-handover techniques in
   different fashion.  However an initial experimental analysis
   demonstrates that proactive handoff of FMIPv6 [RFC4068] and MPA over
   IPv6 do exhibit similar performance characteristics.  Both of these
   approaches limit the handoff delay to layer 2 delay only.  Some of
   the performance results for proactive FMIPv6 [FMIP-results]

   demonstrate the fact that handoff delay is bounded by the layer 2
   handoff delay.  Without any layer 2 optimization and information
   discovery techniques, experimental results from MPA also demonstrate
   that the delay is bounded by layer 2 delay.  However our experimental
   results presented in this document are derived from an MPA prototype
   augmented by the information discovery scheme proposed by IEEE
   802.21.  The information about the neighboring network elements helps
   to reduce the layer 2 handoff delay contributed due to scanning and
   layer 2 authentication.  Besides optimizing layer 2 handoff
   attributed due to scanning and authentication, MPA can also provide
   pre-authentication support at layer 3 in case of inter-domain handoff
   thereby reducing the delay due to layer 3 authentication during
   handoff.  MPA's optimized handoff techniques is not limited to MIPv6
   only, but can also be used for other mobility protocols such as MIPv4
   and SIP as well.  In addition pre-authentication technique and
   stateful pre-configuration technique associated with MPA can also be
   used with FMIPV6 to enhance its operation in certain deployment
   scenarios.
