   1.  Abstract 

     This document is an overview of proposals for various extensions to 
     IMAP to meet the requirements of voice mail systems.  The topics 
     included are 
     - Binary Attachment transfer
     - External Reference 
     - Alternate Codec Request
     - Streaming audio attachments
     - Message length Indicator
     - Body part read indicator

   2.  Introduction

     This Internet Draft summarizes the proposed extensions as discussed 
     at the IMAP-VOICE informal BOF at IETF, Orlando, December 1998.

     IMAP-VOICE is a BOF for discussion of extensions to IMAP4 in 
     support of voice messaging applications, and the standardization of 
     these in the IETF. For more information see 
     http://www.imc.org/ietf-imap-voice/

     Voice messaging transport over Internet Mail is defined by VPIM v2 
     (RFC 2421)[1].  The VPIM effort is led by the VPIM Working Group  
     within the Electronic Messaging Association. For more information 
     see http://www.ema.org/vpim/.

   3.  Conventions Used in this Document

     In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
     server respectively. 

     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
     in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for
     use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [2].

   4.  Binary Attachment Header

     Since VPIM optionally supports binary attachments, and since it may 
     be beneficial for the client not to decode base64 encoded audio, it 
     is desirable to have a method of retrieving binary body parts in 
     IMAP.  Note that this would be nice to have, however it is 
     not needed for voice messaging.  One suggestion for accomplishing 
     this is:

   4.1  A DATA suffix inside a FETCH BODY[] construct

     Its syntax would be similar to that of HEADER.FIELDS as described 
     in IMAP4rev1 [3].

     The DATA part specifier MUST be prefixed by one or more numeric 
     part specifiers.

     C: abc FETCH 1 (BODY[1.2.DATA(ENCODING BINARY)])

     The keyword ENCODING selects encoding as defined in the MIME 
     Content-Transfer-Encoding Header Field. [4]

     Servers that support the DATA part specifier SHOULD list the DATA 
     capability in response to the CAPABILITY command.

   5.  External Reference

     To meet the requirements of voicemail systems, there is a need to 
     support external reference, such as using a telephone for playback 
     of voice messages.  Three suggestions of how this can be 
     accomplished are:

   5.1  Use of an external reference mechanism requires split client 
     support for Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) as well as IMAP.

     If using an external mechanism for playback, implementations may 
     use RTSP as described in RFC 2326 [5], as the control protocol from 
     the client to a proxy server. (Which could make the outcall to the 
     phone)

     Internet Draft               IMAP Voice           February 26, 1999

   5.2  A new optional keyword TO in the DATA part specifier, as 
     described in 4.1, is accompanied by URL for which to send the data. 
     The URL  begins with a protocol.

     C: abc FETCH 1 (BODY[1.2.DATA(TO "rtp:155.5.1.23:4567")])

   5.3  IMAP URLs can be used to reference the message on the IMAP 
     server as 	described in the IMAP URL Scheme [6].

     The IMAP URL for a specific message or message part has the 
     following form:

     imap://<iserver>/<enc_mailbox>[uidvalidity]<iuid>[isection]

   6.  Alternate Codec Request 

     Clients today are using many different types of codecs.  Because of 
     this, there is a desire to have the server transcode and present 
     the message in the appropriate codec for that client.  There are 
     two suggestions for accomplishing this:

   6.1  The receiving IMAP Server should create multipart/alternative on 
     reception 	with support for  'n codecs' where 'n codecs' are the 
     codecs supported at that server.  The client would then have the 
     option of choosing the codec that it supports.

   6.2  Optional keyword TYPE in the DATA suffix (as described in 4.1), 
     if present, requests conversion of the content into the specified 
     type.

     C: abc FETCH 1 (BODY[DATA(ENCODING BINARY TYPE("AUDIO" "GSM"))])

     If the server can't accomplish the conversion, the FETCH fails.

   7.  Streaming Audio Attachments

     Streaming is needed in such cases of large audio attachments, small 
     clients, slow links to allow the user to listen to the message as 
     it is being downloaded, rather than having to download the whole 
     message first.  One suggestion for accomplishing this is:

   7.1  The streaming of audio attachments can be done using windowing. 

     FETCH BODY[]<<partial>>

     Some issues concerning streaming by windowing are 
     - latency 
     - no set window size.

   8.  Message Length Indicator

     In the cases of large attachments, small clients and slow links 
     there is also a need for the client to see the length of the 
     message in a suitable format before opening it. 

     A message length indicator suitable for voicemail and fax should 
     indicate the length of the message using number of seconds for a 
     voice message and using number of pages for a fax message.  The 
     client MUST support the chosen method.  There are three suggested 
     methods:

   8.1  MIME Header Content-Duration as described in RFC 2424 [7]

     For fax messages a new MIME Header, Content-Page-Length, would be 
     defined, similar to Content-Duration with the exception that number 
     of pages would be specified, rather than number of seconds. (e.g. 
     Content-Page-Length:3).  This would be created at originator.

   8.2  FETCH item USERSIZE similar to FETCH items described in 
     IMAP4rev1 [3].  This would be created at reception.

   8.2.1  USERSIZE is a non-negative number.  Its meaning depends on 
     document type.

     C: abc FETCH 1:2 (USERSIZE)
     S: *1 FETCH (12)
     S: *2 FETCH (57)
     S: abc FETCH completed.

   8.2.2  USERSIZE is a pair of number and unit.  There is a small set 
     of unit tokens.

     C: abc FETCH 1:2 (USERSIZE)
     S: *1 FETCH (12 pages)
     S: *2 FETCH (57 seconds)
     S: abc FETCH completed.

   8.2.3  USERSIZE is a sequence of pairs, in case something extends in
     more than 	one unit.

     C: abc FETCH 1:2 (USERSIZE)
     S: *1 FETCH (12 lines)
     S: *1 FETCH (57 pages 6 hours)
     S: abc FETCH completed.

     Servers that support USERSIZE SHOULD list the USERSIZE capability 
     in response to the CAPABILITY command.

   8.3  Message length indicated as a parameter of the Content-Type 
     Header Field [4].  This would be created at the source.  This 
     method would allow the message length to be passed to the client by 
     default. 

     Content-Type=audio/*; length=50
     Content-Type=image/tiff; pages=3

   9.  Body Part Read Indicator

     With the use of multipart messages there should be a separate BODY 
     PART READ indicator for each body part or, at least, to only 
     indicate READ when the primary body part has been read. There are 
     two suggested methods:

   9.1  \SEEN per BODY PART
     For example, if a client retrieves the text part of a message 
     without looking at the audio attachment, the indicator would show 
     that only the text part had been read and not the entire message.

   9.2  \SEEN only after Primary Message Type has been opened. 
     Primary Message Type is discussed in VPIM Unified Message [8]
