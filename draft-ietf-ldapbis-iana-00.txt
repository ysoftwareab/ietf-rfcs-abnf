1. Introduction

  The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [RFC2251] (LDAP) is an
  extensible protocol.  LDAP supports:
    - addition of new operations,
    - extension of existing operations, and
    - extensible schema.

  This document details procedures for registering values of used to
  unambiguously identify extensible elements of the protocol with IANA
  including:
    - LDAP message types,
    - LDAP result codes,
    - LDAP authentication methods,
    - LDAP attribute description options, and
    - Object Identifiers descriptive names

  This document also provides guidelines to IANA describing the
  conditions under which new values can be assigned.


2. Terms and Conventions

  This section details terms and conventions are used in this document.


2.1. Policy terms

  The terms "IESG Approval", "Standards Action", "IETF Consensus",
  "Specification Required", "First Come First Served", "Expert Review",
  and "Private Use" are used as defined in [RFC2434].


2.2. Requirement terms

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.3. Common ABNF productions

  A number of syntaxes in this document are described using ABNF
  [RFC2324].  These syntaxes rely on the following common productions:

       a = %x41-5A / %61-7A  ; A-Z / a-z

       ld = %x31-39          ; 1-9

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ldapbis-iana-00.txt         1 April 2001


       d = %x30 / ld         ; 0-9

       hyphen = %x2D         ; "-"

       period = %x2E         ; "."

       keychar = ( a / d / hyphen )
       leadkeychar = ( a / d )

       keystring = leadkeychar *keychar

  A keyword is case-insensitive UTF-8 [RFC2279] string restricted to the
  keystring production.


3.  IANA Considerations for LDAP

  This section details each of the types of protocol values which can be
  registered and provides IANA guidelines on how to assign new values.


3.1. Object Identifiers Descriptive Names

  LDAP allows short descriptive names to be used instead of an numeric
  Object Identifier to identify protocol extensions [RFC2251], schema
  elements [RFC2252], protocol extensions, LDAP URL [RFC2255]
  extensions, and other objects.  These names SHALL be restricted to
  case-insensitive UTF-8 strings limited by the following ABNF:

       name = keystring

  Multiple names MAY be assigned to a given OID.  For purposes of
  registration, an OID SHALL be represented in numeric OID form
  conforming to the ABNF:

       numericoid = number *( period number ) ; e.g. 1.1.23.4

       number = d / ( ld 1*d )

  While the protocol places no maximum length restriction upon
  descriptive names, they SHOULD be short.  IANA MAY refuse to register
  any name over 48 characters in length.  IANA MAY reject obviously
  bogus registrations.

  Names beginning with "x-" are for Private Use.  IANA SHALL NOT
  register any name beginning with "x-".

  Names beginning with "e-" are reserved for experiments.  IANA SHALL



Zeilenga                        LDAPv3 DN                       [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ldapbis-iana-00.txt         1 April 2001


  register any name beginning with "e-" on a First Come First Served
  basis.

  Expert Review is REQUIRED before accepting registration of all other
  names.

  IANA SHALL NOT verify the registrant "owns" the OID being named.

  The OID namespace is managed by The ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee
  1 - Subcommittee 6.


3.2. AttributeDescription Options

  An AttributeDescription [RFC2251, Section 4.1.5] can contain zero or
  options specifying additional semantics.  An option SHALL be
  restricted to case-insensitive UTF-8 string limited by the following
  ABNF:

       option = keystring

  While the protocol places no maximum length restriction upon option
  strings, they SHOULD be short.  IANA MAY refuse to register any option
  over 16 characters in length.  IANA MAY reject obviously bogus
  registrations.

  Values ending with a hyphen ("-") reserve all option names which start
  with the name.  For example, the registration of the option
  "optionFamily-" reserves all options which start with "optionFamily-"
  for some related purpose.

  Options beginning with "x-" are for Private Use.  IANA SHALL NOT
  register any option beginning with "x-".

  Options beginning with "e-" are reserved for experiments.  IANA SHALL
  register any option beginning with "e-" on a First Come First Served
  basis.

  IANA SHALL register other options by either Standards Action or Expert
  Review with Specification Required.


3.3. LDAP Message Types

  Each protocol message is encapsulated in an LDAPMessage envelope
  [RFC2251, Section 4.1.1].  The protocolOp CHOICE indicates the type of
  message encapsulated.  Each message type consists of a keyword and a
  non-negative choice number is combined with the class (APPLICATION)



Zeilenga                        LDAPv3 DN                       [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ldapbis-iana-00.txt         1 April 2001


  and data type (CONSTRUCTED or PRIMITIVE) to construct the BER tag in
  the message's encoding.  The choice numbers for existing protocol
  messages are implicit in the protocol's ASN.1 defined in [RFC2251].

  New values SHALL only be registered by Standards Track action.

  Note: LDAP provides extensible messages which reduces, but does not
        eliminate, the need to add new message types.


3.4. LDAP Result Codes

  LDAP result messages carry an resultCode enumerated value to indicate
  the outcome of the operation [RFC2251, Section 4.1.10].  Each result
  code consists of a keyword and a non-negative integer.

  IANA SHALL register resultCode integers from 0-255 upon Standards
  Action, 256-1023 with Expert Review, and 1024-8191 on a First Come
  First Served basis.  Keywords associated with integers in the range
  1024-8191 SHALL start with "e-".  IANA MAY reject obviously bogus
  registrations.

  Values greater than or equal to 8192 are for Private Use.


3.5. LDAP Authentication Method

  The LDAP Bind operation supports multiple authentication methods
  [RFC2251, Section 4.2].  Each authentication choice consists of a
  keyword and a non-negative integer.

  Authentication methods usage SHALL be classified using one of the
  following terms:

    COMMON - method is appropriate for common use on the Internet,
    LIMITED USE - method is appropriate for limited uses.
    OBSOLETE - method has been deprecated or other found to be
        inappropriate for any use.

  IANA SHALL NOT register new OBSOLETE mechanisms.  Methods without
  publicly available specifications SHALL NOT be classified as COMMON.

  IANA SHALL register authentication method integers from 0-255 upon
  Standards Action, 256-1023 with Expert Review with Specification
  Required, and 1024-8191 on a First Come First Served basis.  Keywords
  associated with integers in the range 1024-8191 SHALL start with "e-".
  IANA MAY reject obviously bogus registrations.

  Values greater than or equal to 8192 are for Private Use.

  Note: LDAP supports SASL [RFC2222] as an Authentication CHOICE.  SASL
  is an extensible LDAP authentication method.

  Developers of new authentication methods are SHOULD seek appropriate
  review.


3.6. Other values?

  Other LDAP name spaces?


4. Registration Procedure

  The procedure given here MUST be used by anyone who to use a new value
  of a type described in Section 3 of this document which is not
  currently registered with IANA.

  The first step is for the request to fill out the appropriate form.
  Templates are provided in Appendix A.

  If the policy is Standards Action, the completed form SHOULD be
  provided to the IESG with the request for Standards Action.  Upon
  approval of the Standards Action, the IESG SHALL forward the request
  (possibly revised) to IANA.

  If the policy is Expert Review, the requester SHALL post the completed
  form to the <directory@apps.ietf.org> mailing list for public review.
  The review period is two (2) weeks.  If a revised form is later
  submitted, the review period is restarted.  Anyone may subscribe to
  this list my sending a request to <directory-request@apps.ietf.org>.
  During the review, objections may be raised by anyone (including the
  Expert) on the list.  After completion of the review, the Expert,
  based upon public comments, SHALL either approve the request and
  forward it to the IESG OR deny the request.  In either case, the
  Expert SHALL promptly notify the requester of the action .  Actions of
  the Expert may be appealed [RFC2026].  The Expert is appointed by
  Applications Area Director(s).

  If the policy is First Come First Served, the requester SHALL submit
  the completed form directly to the IESG <iesg@iesg.org>.
