MaxBC-1 = 7.

UNRESERVED_BWk = MAX_RESERVABLE_BWk - sum
PROPORTIONAL_BWck = TRAF_LOAD_BWck/[sum {TRAF_LOAD_BWck, c=0, MaxCT-1}]
                    X MAX_RESERVABLE_BWk

BCck = PROPORTIONAL_BWck

   For a high priority CT, the bandwidth constraint BCck is set to a
   multiple of the proportional bandwidth.  That is:

   For high priority CTc:
BCck = FACTOR X PROPORTIONAL_BWck

BCck = 0

MAX-RESERVABLE_BW = 100

BC0 = 30
BC1 = 20
BC2 = 20

RBW_THRES = 10

RESERVED_BW0 = 50
RESERVED_BW1 = 30
RESERVED_BW2 = 10

UNRESERVED_BW = 100 - 50 - 30 - 10 = 10

DBW = 5).  We need to decide, based on Table 1, whether to admit this
UNRESERVED_BWck = MAX_RESERVABLE_BWk - UNRESERVED_BWk -
                     delta0/1(CTck) * RBW-THRESk

RBW_THRESk = RBW_% * MAX_RESERVABLE_BWk,
