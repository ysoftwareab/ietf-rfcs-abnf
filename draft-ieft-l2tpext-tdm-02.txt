1. Introduction 
    
   This document defines extensions to the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol 
   (L2TP) for support of structure-agnostic [PWE3-SATOP] and structure-
   aware [PWE3-CESoPSN], [PWE3-TDMoIP] pseudowires.  
    
2. L2TP Extension 
    
   The L2TP Control Connection is responsible for 3 main operations: 
   1. Establishment and validation of session. 
   2. Ending (tearing down) of session. 
   3. Transferring of End Point status.  
    
   Tearing down of session is identical to [RFC3931]. 
    
   [PWE3-CESoPSN] and [PWE3-SATOP] describe how to transfer the END 
   Point status via the Data Plane. This is therefore RECOMMENDED to not 
   use the Set-Link-Info (SLI) described in [RFC3931]. 
    
   The next sections describe the extensions to the L2TP for 
   establishment and validation of TDM Pseudowire sessions. 
    
   There are 2 new AVPs for the Session Connection Messages. One AVP 
   describe the TDM Pseudowire attributes. The second AVP describe the 
   RTP attributes for this TDM Pseudowire.

   This AVP MAY be hidden (the H bit MAY be 0 or 1).  The M bit for this 
   AVP SHOULD be set to 0.  The Length (before hiding) of this AVP is 
   12. 
    
   Bit Rate is defined in [PWE3-IANA]. Its usage for all types of TDM 
   PWs assumes the following semantics: 
   1. This interface parameter MAY be omitted, if the attachment circuit 
      bit-rate is unambiguously derived from the PW Type.  
   2. Only the following values MUST be specified for structure-agnostic 
      emulation (see [PWE3-SATOP]: 
      a. Structure-agnostic E1 emulation  - 32 
      b. Structure-agnostic T1 emulation: 
         1. MUST be set to 24 for the basic emulation mode  
         2. MUST be set to 25 for the "Octet-aligned T1" emulation mode 
      c. Structure-agnostic E3 emulation  - 535 
      d. Structure-agnostic T3 emulation  - 699 
   3. For all kinds of structure-aware emulation, this parameter MUST be 
      set to the number of DS0 channels in the corresponding attachment 
      circuit. 
    
   Note: for Structure-agnostic T1 emulation the value 24 does not 
   indicate the exact bit rate, and is used for convenience only.  
    
   Payload Bytes has been initially defined for CEP [PWE3-SONET] PWs. 
   It can be used for setup of all types of TDM PWs without any changes 
   in its encoding (see [PWE3-IANA]) with the following semantics: 
    
   1. For Structure-agnostic emulation the payload type can be any 
      value. 
   2. For CESoPSN PWs: 
      a. The specified value MUST be an integer multiple of number of 
         DS0 channels in the corresponding attachment circuit. 
      b. For trunk-specific NxDS0 with CAS, (Payload Bytes/number of DS0 
         channels) must be an integer factor of the number of frames per 
         corresponding trunk multiframe 
   3. For TDMoIP the Payload Bytes must be an integer multiple of 48

   The R bit defines the present of the RTP header.  If the R bit is 1 
   then the RTP header is present and the RTP AVP MUST appear.  If the R 
   bit is zero then the RTP header is not used. 
    
   The T bit is ignored and MUST be set to zero. 
    
   The F bit indicates fragmentation when sending multiframe. The F bit 
   MUST be zero for all TDM PWs Types excluding trunk-specific NxDS0 
   services with CAS using the CESoPSN encapsulation. In case of these 
   services, the F bit MUST be set if the payload size specified value 
   differs from the number of frames per trunk multiframe.

   This AVP MUST appear only if the RTP header is used. 
   This AVP MAY be hidden (the H bit MAY be 0 or 1).  The M bit for this 
   AVP SHOULD be set to 0.  The Length (before hiding) of this AVP is 
   16. 
    
   The D bit indicates differential time stamping in the RTP header.  If 
   the D bit is set to 1 then the time stamping is differential. 
   Otherwise absolute time stamping is used.  Differential mode can be 
   used only if both sides use RTP and use differential time stamping. 
    
   The C bit indicates the ordering of the RTP header and the control 
   word: 
    If the C bit is set to 1 the RTP header appears after the control 
    word.  This mode is described as SAToP/CESoPSN encapsulation over 
    IPv4/IPv6 PSN with L2TPv3 demultiplexing in [PWE3-SATOP] and [PWE3-
    CESoPSN] respectively.  
    If the C bit is set to 0 the RTP header appears before the control 
    word.  This mode described as the old mode of the SAToP/CESoPSN 
    encapsulation over L2TPv3 in [PWE3-SATOP] and [PWE3-CESoPSN] 
    respectively.

   PT is the payload type expected in the RTP header.  Value of zero 
   indicates that the payload type is ignored and will not be used to 
   detect malformed packets. 
   Timestamp Clock Frequency is the clock frequency used for the time 
   stamping in 8 KHz. 
    
   SSRC indicates the expected value of SSRC ID in the RTP header.  A 
   zero in this field means that SSRC ID will not be used for detecting 
   misconnections. Since L2TP provides an alternative security mechanism 
   via the cookies, if the cookie length is larger then zero the SSRC 
   SHOULD be zero. 
    
2.3 Changes in the Control Connection AVPs 
    
   Control Connection that support TDM MUST add the appropriate PW Type 
   value to the list in the Pseudowire Capabilities List AVP. The exact 
   value is TBD by IANA and is listed in the next section. 
    
2.4 Changes in the Session Connection AVPs 
    
   PW Type AVP should be set to one of the following values: 
   1. Structure-agnostic emulation [PWE3-SATOP] of: 
      a. E1 circuits - TBA by IANA 
      b. T1 circuits - TBA by IANA 
      c. E3 circuits - TBA by IANA 
      d. T3 circuits - TBA by IANA 
   2. Structure-aware emulation [PWE3-CESoPSN], [PWE3-TDMoIP] of: 
      a. CESoPSN basic mode - TBA by IANA  
      b. TDMoIP basic mode - TBA by IANA  
      c. CESoPSN service with CAS - TBA by IANA  
      d. TDMoIP with CAS - TBA by IANA 
    
                                        
   TDM pseudowires use their own control word.  Therefore the L2-
   Specific Sublayer AVP MUST either be omitted or set to zero. 
    
   TDM pseudowires use their own sequencing.  Therefore the Data 
   Sequencing AVP MUST either be omitted or set to zero. 
    
3. Creation of the TDM Pseudowire Session 
    
   When LCCE wants to open a Session for TDM PW it should include the 
   TDM PW AVP and the RTP AVP (if needed) in the ICRQ or OCRQ message.  
   The LCCE peer must validate that TDM PW AVP and make sure it can 
   supply the requirements derived from the RTP AVP (if any exist).  If 
   the peer agrees with the CESoPSN AVP it will send an appropriate ICRP 
   or OCRP message with RTP AVP (if needed). The Initiator need to 
   validate that it can supply the requirements derived from the 
   received RTP AVP.

                                L2TP TDM                   October 2005 
 
 
    
   The two peers MUST agree on the values in the TDM PW AVP: 
    
   1. Bit Rate values MUST be equal on both sides. If they are 
      different, the connection will be rejected with return code RC-
      TBD-1 and error code EC-TBD-1.  
   2. If one side does not support the payload bytes value proposed by 
      the other one, the connection will be rejected with return code 
      RC-TBD-1 and error code EC-TBD-2. 
   3. If one side cannot send RTP header requested by the other side, 
      the connection will be rejected with return code RC-TBD-1 and 
      error code EC-TBD-3. 
   4. If one side can send RTP header but not with the requested 
      timestamp clock frequency, the connection will be rejected with 
      return code RC-TBD-1 and error code EC-TBD-4. 
    
4. IANA Considerations 
 
   This draft requires assignment of the following values by IANA: 
    
   PW types listed in Section 2.1 above. 
       
   New attribute value pair IDs: 
    
   1. AVP-TBD-1 - TDM Pseudo-wire AVP 
   2. AVP-TBD-2 - RTP AVP 
    
   New return codes and error codes: 
    
   1. RC-TBD-1 - return code to indicate connection refused because of 
      TDM PW parameters. The exact error code is as follows.  
   2. EC-TBD-1 - indicate Bit Rate values disagree. 
   3. EC-TBD-2 - requested payload size too big or too small. 
   4. EC-TBD-3 - RTP header cannot be generated. 
   5. EC-TBD-4 - requested timestamp clock frequency cannot be 
      generated. 
    
    
Security Considerations 
    
   There are no additional security considerations on top of the ones 
   discussed in [RFC3931]
