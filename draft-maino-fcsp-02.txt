Abstract

   This document describes the use of IKEv2 to negotiate security
   protocols and transforms for Fibre Channel as part of the Fibre
   Channel Security Association Management Protocol.  This usage
   requires that IKEv2 be extended with Fibre-Channel-specific security
   protocols, transforms and name types.  This document specifies these
   IKEv2 extensions and allocates identifiers for them.  Using new IKEv2

   identifiers for Fibre Channel security protocols avoids any possible
   confusion between IKEv2 negotiation for IP networks and IKEv2
   negotiation for Fibre Channel.

2.  Introduction

   Fibre Channel (FC) is a gigabit speed network technology primarily
   used for Storage Networking.  Fibre Channel is standardized in the
   T11 [T11] Technical Committee of the InterNational Committee for
   Information Technology Standards (INCITS), an American National
   Standard Institute (ANSI) accredited standards committee.

   FC-SP (Fibre Channel Security Protocols) is a working group of the
   T11 Technical Committee that is developing the "Fibre Channel
   Security Protocols" standard [FC-SP], a security architecture for
   Fibre Channel networks.

   The FC-SP standard defines a set of protocols for fibre channel
   networks that provides:

   1.  device to device (hosts, disks, switches) authentication;

   2.  management and establishment of secrets and security
       associations;

   3.  data origin authentication, integrity, anti-replay protection,
       confidentiality;

   4.  security policies distribution.

   Within this framework a fibre channel device can verify the identity
   of another fibre channel device, establish a shared secret that will
   be used to negotiate security associations for security protocols
   applied to fibre channel frames and information unit.  The same
   framework allows for distributions within a fibre channel fabric of
   policies that will be enforced by the fabric.

   FC-SP is adapting the IKEv2 protocol [I-D.ietf-ipsec-ikev2-17] to
   provide authentication of Fibre Channel entities and setup of
   security associations.

3.  Overview

   Fibre Channel defines two security protocols that provide security
   services for different portions of Fibre Channel traffic: ESP_Header
   is defined in [FC-FS], while CT_Authentication is defined in [FC-GS].

   The ESP_Header protocol is a transform applied to FC-2 fibre channel
   frames, and is based on the IP Encapsulation Security Payload
   [RFC2406], to provide origin authentication, integrity, anti-replay
   protection and optionally confidentiality to generic fibre channel
   frames.  The CT_Authentication protocol is a transform that provides
   the same set of security services, but is applied to Common Transport
   Information Units, a protocol used for control information.  The
   separation of Fibre Channel data traffic from control traffic results
   in only one protocol (either ESP_Header or CT_Authentication) being
   applicable to any FC Security Associaton.

   Security associations for the ESP_Header and CT_Authentication
   protocols between two fibre channel entities (hosts, disks, or
   switches) are negotiated by the Fibre Channel Security Association
   Management Protocol, a generic protocol based on IKEv2 [I-D.ietf-
   ipsec-ikev2-17].

   Since IP is transported over Fibre Channel [RFC2625] and Fibre
   Channel/SCSI are transported over IP [RFC3643], [RFC3821] there is
   the potential for confusion when IKEv2 is used for both IP and FC
   traffic.  This document specifies identifiers for IKEv2 over FC in a
   fashion that ensures that any mistaken usage of IKEv2/FC over IP will
   result in a negotiation failure due to absence of an acceptable
   proposal (and likewise for IKEv2/IP over FC).  This document gives an
   overview of the security architecture defined by the FC-SP standard,
   including the security protocols used to protect frames and to
   negotiate SAs, and specifies the entities for which new identifiers
   are to be assigned.

4.  Fibre Channel Security Protocols

   The Fibre Channel protocol is described in [FC-FS] as a network
   architecture organized in 5 levels.  The FC-2 level defines the FC
   frame format (shown in Figure 1), the transport services, and control
   functions required for information transfer.

   +-----+-----------+-----------+--------//-------+-----+-----+
   |     |           |         Data Field          |     |     |
   | SOF | FC Header |<--------------------------->| CRC | EOF |
   |     |           | Optional  | Frame           |     |     |
   |     |           | Header(s) | Payload         |     |     |
   +-----+-----------+-----------+--------//-------+-----+-----+

   Figure 1: Fibre Channel Frame Format

   Fibre Channel Generic Services share a Common Transport (CT) at the
   FC-4 level defined in [FC-GS].  The CT provides access to a Service
   (e.g.  Directory Service) with a set of service parameters that
   facilitates the usage of Fibre Channel constructs.

   A Common Transport IU (CT_IU) is the common Fibre Channel Sequence
   used to transfer all information between a Client and a Server.  The
   first part of the CT_IU, shown in Figure 2, contains a preamble with
   information common to all CT_IUs.  An optional Extended CT_IU
   Preamble carries the CT_Authentication protocol that provides
   authentication and optionally confidentiality to CT_IUs.  The CT_IU
   is completed by an optional Vendor Specific Preambol, and by
   additional information as defined by the preamble.

   Figure 2: CT_IU

   Two security protocols are defined for Fibre Channel: the ESP_Header
   protocol that protects the FC-2 level, and the CT_Authentication
   protocol that protects the Common Transport at the FC-4 level.

   Security Association for the ESP_Header and CT_Authentication
   protocols are negotiated by the Fibre Channel Security Association
   Management Protocol.

4.1.  ESP_Header Protocol

   ESP_header is a security protocol for FC-2 Fibre Channel frames that
   provides origin authentication, integrity, anti-replay protection,
   and confidentiality.  ESP_Header is carried as the first optional
   header in the FC-2 frame, and its presence is signaled by a flag in
   the DF_CTL field of the FC-2 header.

   Figure 3 shows the format of an FC-2 frame encapsulated with an
   ESP_Header.  The encapsulation format is equivalent to the IP
   Encapsulating Security Payload [RFC2406], but the scope of the
   authentication covers the entire FC-2 header.  The Destination and
   Source fibre channel addresses (D_ID and S_ID) and the CS_CTL/
   Priority field are normalized before computation of the Integrity
   Check value to allow for address translation.

   Figure 3: ESP_Header Encapsulation

   All the security transforms that are defined for the IP Encapsulating
   Security Payload, such as AES-CBC [RFC3602], can be applied to the
   ESP_Header protocol.

4.2.  CT_Authentication Protocol

   CT_Authentication is a security protocol for Common Transport FC-4
   Information Units that provides origin authentication, integrity,
   anti-replay protection.  The CT_Authentication protocol is carried in
   the optional extended CT_IU preamble

   The extended CT_IU preamble, shown in Figure 4, includes an
   Authentication Security Association Identifier (SAID), a transaction

   The Authentication Hash Block is computed as an HMAC keyed hashing,
   as defined in [RFC2104], of the CT_IU.  The entire output of the HMAC
   computation is included in the Authentication Hash Block, without any
   truncation.  Two transforms are defined: HMAC-SHA1-160 based on the
   cryptographic hash function SHA1[NIST.180-1.1995], and HMAC-MD5-128
   based on the cryptographic hash function MD5 [RFC1321].

5.  The FC SA Management Protocol

   Fibre Channel entities negotiate security associations for the
   protocols described above using the Fibre Channel Security
   Association Management protocol, as defined in [FC-SP].  The protocol
   is a modified subset of the IKEv2 protocol [I-D.ietf-ipsec-ikev2-17]
   that performs the same core operations, and uses the Fibre Channel
   AUTH protocol to transport IKEv2 messages.

   The protocol supports only the basic features of IKEv2: initial
   exchange to create an IKE SA and the first child SA, the
   CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange to negotiate additional SAs, and the
   INFORMATIONAL exchange including notification, delete and vendor ID
   payloads.  IKEv2 features that are not supported for Fibre Channels
   include: negotiation of multiple protocols within the same proposal,
   capability to handle multiple outstanding requests, cookies,
   configuration payload, and the Extended Authentication Protocol (EAP)
   payload.

   The following subsections describe the additional IANA assigned
   values required by the Fibre Channel Security Association Management
   protocol, as defined in [FC-SP].  All the values are to be allocated
   from the new registries created for the IKEv2 protocol [I-D.ietf-
   ipsec-ikev2-17].

5.1.  Fibre Channel Name Identifier

   Fibre Channels entities that negotiate security associations are
   identified by an 8-byte Name.  Support for this name format has been
   added to the IKEv2 Identification Payload, introducing a new ID type
   beyond the ones already defined in section 3.5 of [I-D.ietf-ipsec-
   ikev2-17].  This ID Type MUST be supported by any implementation of
   the Fibre Channel Security Association Management Protocol.

   The FC_Name_Identifier is then defined as a single eight (8) octets
   Fibre Channel Name:

           ID Type                       value
           -------                       -----
           ID_FC_NAME                    To be assigned by IANA

5.2.  ESP_Header and CT_AUthentication Protocol ID

   Security protocols negotiated by IKEv2 are identified by the Protocol
   ID field contained in the proposal substructure of a Security
   Association Payload, as defined in section 3.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-ipsec-
   ikev2-17].

Internet-Draft               IKEv2 in FC-SP               September 2005


   The following protocol ID have been defined to identify the Fibre
   Channel ESP_Header and the CT_Authentication security protocols:

           Protocol ID             value
           -----------             -----
           FC_ESP_HEADER           To be assigned by IANA

           FC_CT_AUTHENTICATION    To be assigned by IANA

   The existing IKEv2 value for ESP (3) is deliberately not reused to
   avoid any possibility of confusion between IKEv2 proposals for IP
   security associations and IKEv2 proposals for FC security
   associations.

   The number and type of transforms that accompany an SA payload are
   dependent on the protocol in the SA itself.  An SA payload proposing
   the establishment of a Fibre Channel SA has the following mandatory
   and optional transform types.

           Protocol              Mandatory Types   Optional Types
           --------              ---------------   --------------
           FC_ESP_HEADER            Encryption     Integrity, DH Groups

           FC_CT_AUTHENTICATION     Integrity      Encryption, DH Groups

5.3.  CT_Authentication Protocol Transform Identifiers

   The CT_Authentication transform ID defined for Transform Type 3
   (Integrity Algorithm), are:

           Name                   Number                    Defined in
           ----                   ------                    ----------
           AUTH_HMAC_MD5_128      To be assigned by IANA    FC-SP

           AUTH_HMAC_SHA1_160     To be assigned by IANA    FC-SP

   These transforms differ from the corresponding _96 transforms used in
   IPsec solely in the omission of the truncation of the HMAC output to
   96 bits; instead the entire output (128 bits for MD5, 160 bits for
   SHA-1) is transmitted.  MD5 support is required due to existing usage
   of MD5 in CT_Authentication; SHA-1 is RECOMMENDED in all new
   implementations.

5.4.  Fibre Channel Traffic Selectors

   Fibre Channel Traffic Selectors allow peers to identify packet flows
   for processing by Fibre Channel security services.  A new Traffic
   Selector Type has been added to the IKEv2 Traffic Selector Types

   Registry defined in section 3.13.1 of [I-D.ietf-ipsec-ikev2-17].
   This Traffic Selector Type MUST be supported by any implementation of
   the Fibre Channel Security Association Management Protocol.

   Fibre Channel traffic selectors are defined in [FC-SP] as a list of
   FC address and protocol ranges, as shown in Figure 9.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   |    TS TYPE    |   Reserved    |       Selector Length         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    Reserved   |               Starting Address                |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    Reserved   |                Ending Address                 |

   | Starting R_CTL| Ending R_CTL  | Starting Type | Ending Type   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Figure 9: Fibre Channel Traffic Selector

   The following table lists the assigned value for the Fibre Channel
   Traffic Selector Type field:

           TS Type                value
           -------                -----
           TS_FC_ADDR_RANGE       To be assigned by IANA

   The Starting and Ending Address fields are 24 bit addresses assigned
   to Fibre Channel names as part of initializing Fibre Channel
   communications (e.g., for a switched Fibre Channel Fabric, end nodes
   aquire these identifiers from Fabric Login, FLOGI).

   The Starting and Ending R_CTL fields are the 8-bit Routing Control
   identifiers that define the category and in some cases he function of
   the FC frame; see [FC-FS] for details.

   The separation of Fibre Channel data traffic from control traffic
   results in only one protocol (either ESP_Header or CT_Authentication)
   being applicable to any FC Security Associaton.  When the Fibre
   Channel Traffic Selector is defined for the ESP_Header protocol, the
   Starting Type and Ending Type fields identify the range of FC-2
   protocols to be selected.  When the Fibre Channel Traffic Selector is
   defined for the CT_Authentication protocol, the FC-2 Type is
   implicitly set to the value '20h' that idenitifies CT_Authentication
   information units, and the Starting Type and Ending Type fields
   identify the range of Generic Service subtypes (GS_Subtype) to be

   selected.  See [FC-FS] and [FC-GS] for details.

5.5.  Negotiating Security Associations for FC and IP

   The ESP_header and CT_Authentication protocols are Fibre-Channel-
   specific security protocols that applies to Fibre Channel frames
   only.  The values identifying security protocols, transforms,
   selectors and name types defined in this document MUST NOT be used
   during IKEv2 negotiation for IPsec protocols.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in IKEv2 [I-D.ietf-ipsec-ikev2-17] apply
   with the exception of those related to NAT traversal, EAP, and IP
   fragmentation.  NAT traversal and EAP, in fact, are not supported by
   the Fibre Channel Security Association Management Protocol (based on
   IKEv2), and IP fragmentation cannot occur because IP is not used to
   carry the Fibre Channel Security Association Management Protocol
   messages.

   Fibre Channel Security Association Management Protocol messages are
   mapped over Fibre Channel Sequences.  A Sequence is able to carry up
   to 4 GB of data, then there are no theoretical limitations to the
   size of IKEv2 messages.  However, some Fibre Channel end point
   implementations have limited sequencing capabilities for the
   particular frames used to map IKEv2 messages over Fibre Channel.  To
   address these limitations the Fibre Channel Security Association
   Management Protocol supports fragmentation of IKEv2 messages (see
   section 5.9 of [FC-SP]).  In those cases where the IKEv2 messages are
   long enough to trigger fragmentation it is possible that attackers
   could prevent the IKEv2 exchange from completing by exhausting the
   reassembly buffers.  The chances of this can be minimized by using
   the Hash and URL encodings instead of sending certificates (see
   section 3.6 of [I-D.ietf-ipsec-ikev2-17]).
