                TRILL Multilevel Using Unique Nicknames
           draft-ietf-trill-multilevel-unique-nickname-00.txt

Abstract

   TRILL routing can be extended to support multiple levels by building
   on the multilevel feature of IS-IS routing. Depending on how
   nicknames are managed, there are two primary alternatives to realize
   TRILL multilevel: the unique nickname approach and the aggregated
   nickname approach as discussed in [MultiL]. This document specifies
   the unique nickname approach. This approach gives unique nicknames to
   all TRILL switches across the multilevel TRILL campus.

1. Introduction

   The multiple level feature of [IS-IS] can increase the scalability of
   TRILL as discussed in [MultiL]. However, multilevel IS-IS needs some
   extensions to support the TRILL multilevel feature. The two most
   significant extensions are how TRILL switch nicknames are managed and
   how distribution trees are handled [MultiL].

   There are two primary alternatives to realize TRILL multilevel

   [MultiL]. One approach, which is referred as the "aggregated
   nickname" approach, involves assigning nicknames to the areas, and
   allowing nicknames to be reused in different areas, by having the
   border TRILL switches rewrite nickname fields when entering or
   leaving an area. For more description about the aggregated nickname
   approach, one can refer to [MultiL] and [SingleN]. The other
   approach, which is referred as the "unique nickname" approach, is
   specified in this document. Unique nickname approach gives unique
   nicknames to all the TRILL switches in the multilevel campus, by
   having the Level-1/Level-2 border TRILL switches advertise into the
   Level 1 area which nicknames are not available for assignment in the
   area, and insert into Level 2 area which nicknames are used by this
   area so that other areas cannot use them anymore, as well as
   informing the rest of the campus how to reach the nicknames residing
   in this area. In the document, protocol extensions that support such
   advertisement are specified. 

   Each RBridge in a unique nickname area calculates two types of trees:
   local distribution trees and global distributions trees. For multi-
   destination traffic that is limited to an area, the packets will be
   flooded on the local distribution tree. Otherwise, the multi-
   destination packets will be flooded along the global distribution
   tree.

   In the unique nickname approach, nicknames are globally valid so that
   border RBridges do not rewrite the nickname field of TRILL data
   packets that are transitions between Level 1 and Level 2, as border
   RBrides do in the aggregated nickname approach. If a border RBridge
   is a transit node on a forwarding path, it does not learn MAC
   addresses of the TRILL data packets forwarded along this path.
   Testing and maintenance operations that originate in one area and
   terminate in a different area are also simplified [MultiL]. For these
   reasons, unique nickname approach might realize simpler border
   RBridges than the aggregated nickname approach. However, the unique
   nickname approach is less scalable and may be less well suited for
   very large campuses.

          Figure 3.1: An example topology for TRILL multilevel

   Figure 3.1 is adapted from the example topology of [MultiL]. 

   The routing processes are described in the following two subsections.

3.1. Unicast Routing

   The plain RBridge RB27 has a different view of the topology of the
   TRILL campus than its border RBridge RB2. For an outward path that
   reaches an RBridge not in the same area (say RB44), RB27 calculates
   the segment of the path in Area X, the border RBridge RB2 calculates
   the segment in Level 2, while the border RBridge to the destination
   area, RBridge RB3, calculates the segment from itself to RB44. 

   Let's say that S transmits a frame to destination D and let's say
   that D's location is learned by the relevant TRILL switches already.
   These relevant switches have learned the following:

   1) RB27 has learned that D is connected to nickname 44.

   The following sequence of events will occur:

   -  S transmits an Ethernet frame with source MAC = S and destination
      MAC = D.

   -  RB27 encapsulates with a TRILL header with ingress RBridge = 27,
      and egress RBridge = 44 producing a TRILL Data packet.

   -  RB2 has announced in the Level 1 IS-IS instance in Area X, that it
      owns all nicknames of other areas, including 44. Therefore, IS-IS
      routes the packet to RB2.

INTERNET-DRAFT      TRILL Multilevel Unique Nickname        May 27, 2016


   -  The packet is forwarded through Level 2, from RB2 to RB3, which
      has advertised, in Level 2, it owns the nickname 44.

   -  RB3, when forwarding into Area Y, does not change the ingress
      nickname 27 or the egress nickname 44.

   -  RB44, when decapsulating, learns that S is attached to nickname
      27.

3.2. Multicast Routing

   The scope of multicast routing is defined by the tree root nickname.
   A tree with a Level 2 tree root nickname is global and a tree with
   Level 1 tree root nickname is local. See Section 4.2 for the Level 1
   and Level 2 nickname allocation.

   Border RBridges announce the global trees to be calculated only for
   those Data Labels that span across areas. APPsub-TLVs as specified in
   Section 3.2 of [TreeSel] will be advertised for this purpose. Based
   on the Data Label, an ingress RBridge can determine whether a global
   tree or a local tree is to be used for a TRILL multi-destination Data
   packet.

   If there are legacy TRILL switches that do not understand the APPsub-
   TLVs for tree selection, configuration MUST guarantee that global
   Data Labels are disabled on these legacy TRILL switches (Otherwise,
   the legacy TRILL switches might use local trees for multi-destination
   traffic with a global scope.). These legacy TRILL switches may use
   global trees to flood multi-destination packets with a scope of the
   local area. Those global trees MUST be pruned at the border TRILL
   switches based on Data Labels.

3.2.1. Local Distribution Trees

   The root RBridge RB1 of a local distribution tree resides in the
   area. RBridges in this area calculate this local tree based on the
   link state information of this area, using RB1's nickname as the
   root. Protocol behaviors for local distribution trees have been
   specified in 4.5 of [RFC6325]. The only different is that the local
   distribution tree spans this area only. A multi-destination packet
   with an egress nickname of the root RBridge of a local tree MUST NOT
   be leaked into Level 2 at the border RBridge. 

3.2.2. Global Distribution Trees

   Within Level 2, the RBridge with the highest tree root priority
   advertises the set of global trees by providing a list of Level 2
   RBridge nicknames just as defined in Section 4.5 of [RFC6325].

INTERNET-DRAFT      TRILL Multilevel Unique Nickname        May 27, 2016


   According to [RFC6325], the RBridge with the highest root priority
   advertises the tree roots for a Level 1 area. There has to be a
   border RBridge with the highest root tree priority in each area so
   that it can advertises the global tree root nicknames into the area.
   Also, this border RBridge needs to advertise the set of local
   distribution trees by providing another set of nicknames. Since
   nicknames of global tree roots and local tree roots indicate
   different flooding scopes, these two set MUST NOT overlap. If a
   border RBridge has been assigned both as a global tree root and a
   local tree root, it has to acquire both a global tree root
   nickname(s) and local tree root nickname(s). However, non-border
   RBridges in an area do not differentiate between a global tree root
   nickname and a local tree root nickname. 

   Suppose RB3 is the RBridge with the highest tree root priority within
   Level 2, and RB2 is the highest tree root priority in Area X. RB2
   advertises in Area X that nickname RB3 is the root of a distribution
   tree. Figure 3.2 through Figure 3.5 illustrate how different RBridges
   view the global distribution tree.

   -  RB27 produces a multi-destination (M bit is one) TRILL Data packet
      with ingress RBridge = 27 and egress RBridge = 3. RB27 floods this
      packet using the segment of the global distribution tree that
      resides in Area X.

   -  RB2, when flooding the packet in Level 2, uses the segment of the
      global distribution tree that resides in Level 2.

   -  RB3, when flooding the packet into Area Y, uses the segment of the
      global distribution tree that resides in Area Y.

   -  The multicast listener RB44, when decapsulating the received
      packet, learns that S is attached to nickname 27.

4. Protocol Basics and Extensions


4.1. Multilevel TRILL Basics

   Multilevel TRILL builds on the multilevel feature of [IS-IS]. Border
   RBridges are in both a Level 1 area and in Level 2. They establish
   adjacency with Level 1 RBridges as specified in [RFC7177] and
   [RFC6325]. They establish adjacency with Level 2 RBridges in exactly
   the same way except that (1) for a LAN link the IS-IS Hellos used are
   Level 2 Hello PDUs [IS-IS] and (2) for a point-to-point link the
   Level is configured and indicated in flags in the point-to-point
   Hello. The state machines for Level 1 and Level 2 adjacency are
   independent and two RBridges on the same LAN link can have any
   adjacency state for Level 1 and, separately, any adjacency state for
   Level 2. Level 1 and Level 2 link state flooding are independent
   using Level 1 and Level 2 versions of the relevant IS-IS PDUs (LSP,
   CSNP, PSNP, FS-LSP, FS-CSNP and FS-PSNP). Thus Level 1 link state
   information stays within a Level 1 area and Level 2 link state
   information stays in Level 2 unless there are specific provisions for
   leaking (copying) information between levels. This is why multilevel
   can address the TRILL scalability issues as specified in Section 2 of
   [MultiL].

   The former "campus wide" minimum acceptable link size Sz is
   calculated as before by Level 1 RBridges (including border RBridges)
   using the originatingLSPBufferSize advertised in Level 1 LSP so it is
   area local in multilevel TRILL. A minimum acceptable link size in
   Level 2, called Sz2, is calculated by the RBridges participating in
   Level 2 in the same way as Sz is calculated but using the
   originatingLSPBufferSize distributed in Level 2 LSPs. 

4.2. Nickname Allocation

INTERNET-DRAFT      TRILL Multilevel Unique Nickname        May 27, 2016


   Level 2 RBridges contend for nicknames in the range from 0xF000
   through 0xFBFF the same way as specified in [RFC6325], using Level 2
   LSPs. The highest priority border router for a Level 1 area should
   contend with others in Level 2 for smallish blocks of nicknames for
   the range from 0x0001 to 0xEFFF. Blocks of 64 aligned on multiple of
   64 boundaries are RECOMMENDED in this document. 

   The nickname contention in Level 2 will figure out which blocks of
   nicknames are available for an area and which blocks of nicknames are
   used else where. The NickBlockFlags APPsub-TLV as specified in
   Section 4.3 will be used by the border RBridge(s) to announce the
   nickname availability. 

4.3. Nickname Announcements

   Border RBridges need to exchange nickname information between Level 1
   and Level 2, otherwise forwarding paths inward/outward will not be
   calculated. For this purpose, border RBridges need to fabricate
   nickname announcements. Sub-TLVs used for such artificial
   announcements are specified as follows. 

   Besides its own nickname(s), a border RBridge needs to announce, in
   its area, the ownership of all external nicknames that are reachable
   from this border RBridge. These external nicknames include nicknames
   used in other unique nickname areas and nicknames in Level 2. Non-
   border RBridge nicknames within aggregated nickname areas are
   excluded. Also, a border RBridge needs to announce, in Level 2, the
   ownership of all nicknames within its area. From listening to these
   Level 2 announcements, border RBridges can figure out the nicknames
   used by other areas. 

   RBridges in the TRILL base protocol use the Nickname Sub-TLV as
   specified in Section 2.3.2 of [RFC7176] to announce the ownership of
   nicknames. However, it becomes uneconomic to use this Sub-TLV to
   announce a mass of internal/external nicknames. To address this
   issue, border RBridges should make use of the NickBlockFlags APPsub-
   TLV to advertise into the Level 1 area the inclusive range of
   nicknames that are available or not for self allocation by the Level
   1 RBridges in that area. Its structure is as follows:

INTERNET-DRAFT      TRILL Multilevel Unique Nickname        May 27, 2016


             |     Nickname Block 1                          |

             +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

      o  Type: tbd2 (TRILL NickBlockFlags)

      o  Length: 2 + 2*K where K is the number of nickname blocks. 

      o  OK: 

         - When this bit is set to 1, the blocks of nicknames in this
           APPsub-TLV are available for Level 1 use of the area. The
           APPsub-TLV will be advertised in both Level 1 and Level 2.
           For nicknames that fall in the ranges or the nickname blocks,
           RBridges of Level 2 always route to the originating border
           RBridge, just as if this border RBridge owns these
           nicknames.

         - When this bit is set to 0, it indicates that the nicknames
           covered by the nickname blocks are being used in Level 2 or
           other areas so that they are not available for Level 1 use of
           the area. The APPsub-TLV will be advertised into Level 1
           only. For nicknames that fall in the ranges of the nickname
           blocks, RBridges of the area always route to the originating
           border RBridge, just as if this border RBridge owns these
           nicknames.

      o  RESV: reserved for future flag allocation. MUST be sent as zero
         and ignored on receipt.

      o  Nickname Block: a starting and ending nickname as follows:

             +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
             |     starting nickname                         |
             +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
             |     ending nickname                           |
             +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   For nicknames in these ranges, other RBridges will deem that they are
   owned by the originating border RBridge. The paths to nicknames that
   fall in these ranges will be calculated to reach the originating
   border RBridge. TRILL Data packets with egress nicknames that are
   neither in these ranges nor announced by any RBridge in the area MUST
   be discarded.

   There might be multiple border RBridges connected to the same area.
   Each border RBridges may advertise a subset of the entire
   internal/external nickname space in order to realize load balance.
   However, optimization of such load balance is an implementation issue
   and is out the scope of this document.

   As specified in Section 4.2.6 of [RFC6325], multiple border RBridges
   may claim the same nicknames outward and/or inward. Other RBridges
   add those nicknames as if they are attached to all of those border
   RBridges.

4.4. Capability Indication

   All border RBridge MUST understand the NickBlockFlags APPsub-TLV. Non
   border RBridges in an area SHOULD understand the NickBlockFlags
   APPsub-TLV. If an RBridge within an area understands the
   NickBlockFlags APPsub-TLV, it MUST indicate this capability by
   announcing it in its TRILL-VER Sub-TLV. (See Section 7). 

   If there are RBridges that do not understand the NickBlockFlags
   APPsub-TLV, border RBridges of the area will also use the traditional
   Nickname Sub-TLV [RFC7176] to announce into the area those nicknames
   covered by the nickname blocks of the NickBlockFlags APPsub-TLV whose
   OK is 0. The available range of nicknames for this area should be
   configure on these traditional RBridges.

5. Mix with Aggregated nickname Areas

   The design of TRILL multilevel allows a mixture of unique nickname
   areas and aggregated nickname areas (see Section 1.2 of [MultiL]).
   Usage of nickname space must be planed so that nicknames used in any
   one unique nickname area and Level 2 are never used in any other
   areas which includes unique nickname areas as well as aggregated
   nickname areas. In other words, nickname re-usage is merely allowed
   among aggregated nickname areas. 

   Border RBridges of an aggregated area need to announce nicknames
   heard from Level 2 into their area like just like an unique nickname
   border RBridge. But these RBridges do not announce nicknames of their
   area into Level 2.

   Each border RBridge of the aggregated areas will appear on the global
   tree, as specified in Section 4.1, as a single node. The global trees
   for unique nickname areas span unique nickname areas and Level 2 but
   never reach the inside of aggregated areas. 

6. Security Considerations

   With TRILL multilevel, flooding of control traffic for link state
   information of Level 1 and Level 2 is separated. This addresses the
   TRILL scalability issues as specified in Section 2 of [MultiL] and
   also confines the effective scope of possible malicious events.
   However, due to the nature that unique nickname areas share a unique
   nickname space, border RBridges still have to leak nickname
   information between levels. For this purpose, border RBridges need to
   fabricate the nickname announcements as specified in Section 4.3.
   Malicious devices may also fake the NickBlockFlags APPsub-TLV to
   announce a range of nicknames. By doing this, the attacker can
   attract TRILL data packets that are originally to reach a bunch of
   other RBridges. For this reason, RBridges SHOULD be configured to
   include the IS-IS Authentication TLV (10) in the IS-IS PDUs that
   contains the NickBlockFlags APPsub-TLV, so that IS-IS security
   ([RFC5304] [RFC5310]) can be used to secure the network.

   If border RBridges do not prune multi-destination distribution tree
   traffic in Data Labels that are configured to be area local, then
   traffic that should have been contained within an area might be
   wrongly delivered to end stations in that Data Label in other areas.
   This would generally violate security constraints.

   For general TRILL Security Considerations, see [RFC6325].

7. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register a new flag bit with mnemonic "B" (Block
   of Nicknames) under the TRILL-VER Sub-TLV Capabilities registry.

         Bit       Mnemonic  Description             Reference
         ---       --------  -----------             ---------
         tbd1      B         Able to handle the      [This document]
                             NickBlockFlags
                             APPsub-TLV

   IANA is requested to assign a new type for the NickBlockFlags APPsub-
   TLV from the range available below 256 and add the following entry to
   the "TRILL APPsub-TLV Types under IS-IS TLV 251 Application
   Identifier 1" registry as follows:

         Type    Name            Reference
         ----    ------          ---------
         tbd2    NickBlockFlags  [This document]
