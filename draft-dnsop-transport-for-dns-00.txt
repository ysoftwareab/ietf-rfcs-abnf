Abstract

   DNS queries and responses are available over a variety of transports
   (UDP/TCP) and may be ported to use other transports in the future.
   Current use profiles show that most user generated DNS traffic

Internet-Draft                DNS-TRANSPORT                  August 2009


1.  Introduction

   Familiarity with the DNS [RFC1034], [RFC1035], EDNS0 [RFC2671], and
   Security Extensions [RFC4033], [RFC4034] and [RFC4035] is assumed.

   DNS queries and responses are available over a variety of transports
   (UDP/TCP) and may be ported to use other transports in the future.
   Current use profiles show that most user generated DNS traffic
   prefers one transport over another.  This historical usage pattern
   has or may lead to the presumption that any DNS traffic, regardless
   of transport, should be considered on equal footing.

   However, not all choices for transport share an equal cost to the DNS
   operator.  This note is intended to inform and educate - that while
   all transport options MUST/need to be supported, because of the
   different cost and risk profiles of some transports, an operator may
   chose to apply different processing criteria to different transports,
   prefering some transport options over others.


2.  Motivating Factors

2.1.  UDP vs TCP for DNS messages

   TCP requires more/longer-living state on both parties of a
   transaction.  For high volume DNS servers even small states per each
   query that need to be kept for "long" time is a potential DoS vector.
   Number of DNS servers are answering 50-100 Kq/s thus any state will
   consume significant memory resources.  UDP requires no state past the
   lifetime of the query.


3.  Security Considerations

   Some transport options have different risk profiles and as their use
   increases, their use may be curtailed by the operator as a means of
   protecting their infrastructure.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA consideration.
