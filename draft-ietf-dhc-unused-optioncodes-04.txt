Abstract

   Prior to the publication of RFC2489 (which was updated by RFC2939),
   several option codes were assigned to proposed DHCP options that were
   subsequently never used.  This document lists those unused option
   codes and will be used to confirm that these option codes can be
   reused for other DHCP options in the future.

1. Introduction

   This document lists the unused DHCP option codes from the IANA list
   of BOOTP and DHCP option codes [1].  Each option code includes any
   known documentation and contact information from the IANA list.

3. Option codes used in PXE Specification

   The following option codes are used in the "Preboot Execution
   Environment (PXE) Specification, Version 2.1" [2].  However, although
   these options are in widespread use by devices that use PXE, none of
   these option codes have been described in a published RFC.

   The dhc WG will endeavor to have specifications for these options
   published.

   Contact:           Dan Harrington, Michael Johnston


4. Option Code Extensions

   Note that these option codes are identified in draft-volz-dhc-
   extended-optioncodes-00 [3] as part of a mechanism for extending the
   set of option codes available to DHCP.  If these option codes are not
   used for DHCP option code extension, they will be returned to IANA
   for reassignment to other DHCP options.

   Codes:             126, 127

   Name:              Option Code Extensions

   Defined in:        (expired Internet-Draft)

   Contact:           Ralph Droms

   Reason to recover: Never published as standard; note that these
      option codes are mentioned in "Extending DHCP Options Codes" [3].


5. Already Returned for Reassignment

   The option codes 99, 102-107, 109 and 111 have already been returned
   for reassignment to future DHCP options.

6. IANA Considerations

   When this document has been published as an Informational RFC, IANA
   will be requested to return the unused DHCP option codes to the list
   of available option codes.  These option codes may be reassigned to
   new DHCP options, according to the procedures in RFC 2939 [6].
