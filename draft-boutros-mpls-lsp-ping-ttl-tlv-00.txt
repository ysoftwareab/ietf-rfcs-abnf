Abstract 

   LSP-Ping is a widely deployed Operation, Administration, and 
   Maintenance (OAM) mechanism in MPLS networks. However, in the present 
   form, this mechanism is inadequate to verify connectivity of a 
   segment of a Multi-Segment PseudoWire (MS-PW) from any node on the 
   path of the MS-PW. This document defines a TLV to address this 
   shortcomming.

1. Introduction 

      A MS-PW [4] can span across multiple service provider networks. In 
   order to allow Service Providers (SP) to verify segments of such MS-
   PW from any node on the path of the MS-PW, any node along the path of 
   the MS-PW, should be able to originate an LSP-Ping [2][3] echo 
   request packet to any another node along the path of the MS-PW and 
   receive the corresponding echo reply. If the originator of the echo 
   request is at the end of a MS-PW, the receiver of the request can 
   send the reply back to the sender without knowing the hop-count 
   distance  of  the  originator.  For  example,  the  reply  will  be 
   intercepted by the originator regardless of the TTL value on the 
   reply packet. But, if the originator is not at the end of the MS-PW, 
   the receiver of the echo request MAY need to know how many hops away 
   the originator of the echo request is so that it can set the TTL 
   value on the MPLS header for the echo reply to be intercepted at the 
   originator node. 

   A new optional TTL TLV is being proposed in this document this TLV 
   will be added by the originator of the echo request to inform the 
   receiver how many hops away the originator is on the path of the MS-
   PW.

2. Terminology 

   LSR: Label Switching Router 

   MPLS-OAM: MPLS Operations, Administration and Maintenance 

   MS-PW: Multi-Segment PseudoWire 

   PW: PseudoWire 

   TLV: Type Length Value 

   TTL: Time To Live 

    

3. Time To Live TLV

                  Figure 1: Time To Live TLV format 

   
   The TTL TLV has the format shown in Figure 1. This TLV shall be 
   included in the echo request by the originator of request. If a TTL 
   TLV is present in the echo request, the LSR processing the echo 
   request MUST use the TTL value specified in TLV in the MPLS header of 
   the echo reply. 

   The use of this TLV is optional. If the value field is zero, the LSP 
   Ping Echo request packet will be dropped.  

   If a receiver does not understand the TTL TLV, it can simply ignore 
   the TLV. In the absence of TTL TLV or if TTL TLV is ignored by a 
   receiver, the determination of the TTL value used in the MPLS label 
   on the echo reply is beyond the scope of this document.  

4. Operation 

   In this section, we explain a use case for the TTL TLV with an MPLS 
   MS-PW.

                <------------------MS-PW ---------------------> 

                A          B          C           D           E 
                o -------- o -------- o --------- o --------- o 
                           ------Echo Request-----> 
                           <-----Echo Reply-------- 
    

                 Figure 2: Use-case with MS-PWs 

   Let us assume a MS-PW going through LSRs A, B, C, D, and E. 
   Furthermore, assume that an operator wants to perform a connectivity 
   check between B and D from B. Thus, an LSP-Ping request with the TTL 
   TLV is originated from B and sent towards D. The echo request packet 
   contains the FEC of the PW Segment between C and D. The value field 
   of the TTL TLV and the TTL field of the MPLS label are set to 2. The 
   echo request is intercepted at D because of TTL expiry. D detects the 
   TTL TLV in the request, and use the TTL value (i.e., 2) specified in 
   the TLV on the MPLS label of the echo reply. The echo reply will be 
   intercepted by B because of TTL expiry.  

5. Security Considerations 

   TBD 

6. IANA Considerations 

   IANA maintains the registry for the Type field of top-level TLVs as 
   well as any associated sub-TLVs. IANA is requested to assign a new 
   Type value for the TTL TLV defined in this document. The suggested 
   value is 11.
