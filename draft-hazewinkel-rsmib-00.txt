1.  Abstract

   This memo defines a MIB for use with managing information services.
   The term "information services" is construed to mean any information
   providing application, such as World Wide Web (WWW), File Transfer 
   Protocol (FTP), and Gopher. The retrieval service is an abstraction 
   for the information transport protocol. The retrieval service which 
   is a connection-less service can by instantiate by, for instance, the  
   Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, or the File Transfer Protocol.

2.  The	SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework	consists of four major
components.  They are:

o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
     objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

o    RFC 1901 Introduction to Community-based SNMPv2

o    RFC 1902 Structure	of Management Information for Version 2	of
     the Simple	Network	Management Protocol (SNMPv2)

o    RFC 1903 Textual Conventions for Version 2	of the Simple
     Network Management	Protocol (SNMPv2)

o    RFC 1904 Conformance Statements for Version 2 of the Simple
     Network Management	Protocol (SNMPv2)

o    RFC 1907 Management Information Base for Version 2	of the
     Simple Network Management Protocol	(SNMPv2)

o    RFC 1908 Coexistence between Version 1 and	Version	2 of the
     Internet-standard Network Management Framework


The Framework permits new objects to be	defined	for the	purpose	of
experimentation	and evaluation.


2.1.  Object Definitions

Managed	objects	are accessed via a virtual information store,
termed the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB
are defined using the subset of	Abstract Syntax	Notation One
(ASN.1)	defined	in the SMI[1]. In particular, each object type is
named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type	together with an object	instance serves	to
uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object. For
human convenience, we often use	a textual string, termed the
object descriptor, to refer to the object type.

3.  Introduction.

   The Retrieval Service is a connection-less service providing 
   transport of information between a client and a server. The service 
   is an abstraction of the information transport protocol used. 
   The Retrieval Service MIB module contains network management 
   information about a provided service. Because the Retrieval Service
   is an abstraction of the information transport service used in, for
   instance, the World Wide Web, details of the transport protocol 
   providing this service are of no importance to the users of the 
   Retrieval Service.

   The work performed for this MIB is a result of a project executed for
   the Centre of Earth Observations. It is not seen as complete, but it 
   should be a first step in an effort to manage the WWW application. 
   An implementation of this MIB already exists. Due to the use of a 
   commercial development package it cannot be distributed. However, a 
   public domain version is now developed.

4.  Retrieval Service MIB structure

   The Retrieval Service module contains the following groups:
   1.	service primitives/ statistics,
   2.	quality of service.

4.1. Statistics group

   Communication via the Retrieval Service takes place by means of
   service primitives used by the connection-less service. The statistics
   group contains statistical information concerning the service 
   primitives passed over the Service Access Point (SAP). The variables
   of this group count the number of service primitives executed on the 
   retrieval service.

   Two possible solutions were seen to define these counters:
   1.	The total numbers of service primitives are counted by type.
        For each service primitive type used by the retrieval service 
        a managed object has to be defined.
   2.	The total number of service primitives related to a remote host 
        and service primitive-type are counted. This results in a 
        conceptual table; for each service primitive type used by the 
        retrieval service a table has to be defined, indexed with the 
        IpAddress of the remote host. The remote host is a parameter of 
        the service primitive. 

   It was decided that the simplicity of the first solution outweighed 
   the increased information present in the second.

4.2. Quality of Service group

   The Quality of Service QoS group contains network management 
   information about the quality of the retrieval service. The 
   information in this group provides the network manager with 
   visibility of the performance of the underlying network.

   The recognized QoS parameters are:

    -	The transport delay is defined as a table. The table is indexed 
        with the source and destination addresses of the delay.

        The total round trip delay can be computed by the Network 
        Management System user. 

    -	The number of errors variable provides information on errors 
        which have occurred in the retrieval service.
    -	The number of timeouts variable provides information on timeouts 
        which have occurred in the retrieval service.
    -	The throughput table provides information on the speed of the 
        network with a given client. The address of the client is used 
        to index the table.
