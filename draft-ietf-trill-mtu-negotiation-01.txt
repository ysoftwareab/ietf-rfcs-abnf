                      TRILL IS-IS MTU Negotiation
                draft-ietf-trill-mtu-negotiation-01.txt

Abstract

   The base IETF TRILL protocol has a TRILL campus wide MTU feature,
   specified in RFC 6325 and RFC 7177, that assures that link status
   changes can be successfully flooded throughout the campus while being
   able to take advantage of a campus wide capability to support jumbo
   packets. This document specifies optional updates to that MTU feature
   to take advantage, for appropriate link local packets, of link local
   MTUs that exceed the TRILL campus MTU. In addition, it specifies an
   efficient algorithm for local MTU testing. It updates RFC 7177.

INTERNET-DRAFT              MTU Negotiation            September 2, 2015


1. Introduction

   [RFC6325] describes the way RBridges agree on the campus-wide minimum
   acceptable inter-RBridge MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) size - the
   campus-wide "Sz" to ensure that link state flooding operates properly
   and all RBridges converge to the same link state. For the proper
   operation of TRILL IS-IS, all RBridges MUST format their LSPs not
   greater than the campus-wide Sz. [RFC7177] defines the diagram of
   state transitions of an adjacency. "Link MTU size is successfully
   tested" is part of an event (A6) causing the transition from "2-way"
   state to "Report" state for an adjacency. If MTU testing is enabled,
   this part means the link MTU testing of size X succeeds, and X is
   greater than or equal to the campus-wide Sz [RFC6325]. In other
   words, if this link cannot support an MTU of the campus-wide Sz, it
   will not be reported as part of the campus topology.

   This document specifies a new value, link-wide "Lz" to represent the
   link-wide minimum acceptable inter-RBridge MTU size for a specific
   link. There are PDUs which are valid only to a local link, such as
   CSNPs and PSNPs. These PDUs should be formatted not greater than the
   link-wide Lz. Since link-wide Lz is frequently greater than the
   campus-wide Sz, link scope PDUs can, in such cases, be optionally
   formatted greater than the campus-wide Sz up to Lz.

   An optional TRILL IS-IS MTU size testing algorithm is specified in
   Section 3 to detail the MTU testing method described in Section 4.3.2
   of [RFC6325] and in [RFC7177]. Multicasting the MTU-probes is
   recommended when there are multiple RBridges on a link responding to
   the probing with MTU-ack [RFC7177]. The testing method and rules of
   this document are devised in a way to minimize the number of MTU
   probes for testing, which therefore reduces the number of multicast
   packets for MTU testing.

1.1. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Link-Wide TRILL IS-IS MTU Size

   This document specifies a new value "Lz" to represent the acceptable
   inter-RBridge link MTU size on the local link. Link-wide Lz is the
   minimum Lz supported by all RBridges on a specific link. If the link
   is usable, Lz will be greater than or equal to the campus wide Sz
   MTU. Some TRILL IS-IS PDUs are exchanged only between neighbors
   instead of the whole campus. They should be confined by the link-wide
   Lz instead of the campus-wide Sz. CSNPs and PSNPs are examples of
 


Mingui Zhang, et al      Expires March 5, 2016                  [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT              MTU Negotiation            September 2, 2015


   such PDUs. They are exchanged just on the link as part of LSP
   synchronization.

   [RFC7356] defines the PDUs which support flooding scopes in addition
   to area wide scope and domain wide scope. RBridges on a local link
   that support Lz greater than Sz MUST support the Extended L1 Circuit
   Scoped (E-L1CS) flooding. They use that flooding to exchange their
   maximally supportable value of "Lz". The smallest value of the Lz
   collected on a link, but not less than Sz, is the link-wide Lz.
   RBridge on a local link will be able to tell which other RBridges on
   that link support E-L1CS FS-LSPs because, as required by [RFC7180bis]
   all RBridges are required to include the Scoped Flooding Support TLV
   [RFC7356] in their TRILL Hellos.

   The maximum sized level 1 link-local PDU, such as PSNP or CSNP, which
   may be generated by a system is controlled by the value of the
   management parameter originatingL1SNPBufferSize. This value
   determines Lz. The TRILL APPsub-TLV shown in Figure 2.1 SHOULD be
   included in a GENINFO TLV [RFC6823] in an E-L1CS-LSP number zero. If
   it is missing from a fragment zero E-L1CS-LSP or there is no fragment
   zero E-L1CS FS-LSP, it is assumed that its originating IS is
   implicitly advertising its originatingSNPBufferSize value as Sz
   octets.

   E-L1CS FS-LSPs are link local and can also be sent up to Lz in size
   but, for robustness, E-L1CS fragment zero MUST NOT exceed 1470 bytes.

   Figure 2.2: Link-wide Lz = 1800 v.s. tested link MTU size = 1700 

   Even if all RBridges on a specific link have reached consensus on the
   value of link-wide Lz, it does not mean that these RBridges can
   safely exchange PDUs between each other. Figure 2.2 shows such a
   corner case. RB1, RB2 and RB3 are three RBridges on the same link and
   their Lz is 1800, so the link-wide Lz of this link is 1800. There is
   an intermediate bridge (say B1) between RB2 and RB3 whose port MTU
   size is 1700. If RB2 sends PDUs formatted in chunk of size 1800, it
   will be discarded by B1.

   Therefore the link MTU size should be tested. After the link MTU size
   of an adjacency is successfully tested, those link local PDUs such as
   CSNP, PSNP and also E-L1CS FS-LSP will be formatted no greater than
   the tested link MTU size and will be safely transmitted on this link.

   As for campus-wide Sz, RBridges continue to propagate their
   originatingL1LSPBufferSize across the campus through the
   advertisement of LSPs as defined in Section 4.3.2 of [RFC6325]. The
   smallest value of Sz advertised by any RBridge, but not less than
   1470, will be deemed as the campus-wide Sz. Each RBridge should
   format their "campus-wide" PDUs, for example LSPs, not greater than
   what they believe to be the campus-wide Sz.

3. Link MTU Size Testing

   [RFC7177] defines the event A6 as including "MTU test is successful"
   if the MTU testing is enabled. As described in Section 4.3.2 of
   [RFC6325], this is a combination of the following event and
   condition.

   Event: The link MTU size has been tested.

   Condition: The link can support the campus-wide Sz.

   This condition can be efficiently tested by the following "Binary
   Search Algorithm" and rules. The MTU-probe and MTU-ack PDUs are

INTERNET-DRAFT              MTU Negotiation            September 2, 2015


   specified in Section 3 of [RFC7176].

   X, X1, and X2 are local integer variables.

   Step 0: RB1 sends an MTU-probe padded to the size of link-wide Lz. 

   1) If RB1 successfully receives the MTU-ack from RB2 to the probe of
      the value of link-wide Lz within k tries (where k is a
      configurable parameter whose default is 3), then link MTU size is
      set to the size of link-wide Lz and stop. 

   2) RB1 tries to send an MTU-probe padded to the size 1470. 

      a) If RB1 fails to receive an MTU-ack from RB2 after k tries, RB1
         sets the "failed minimum MTU test" flag for RB2 in RB1's Hello
         and stop. 

      b) Link MTU size <-- 1470, X1 <-- 1470, X2 <-- link-wide Lz, X <--
         [(X1 + X2)/2] (Operation "[...]" returns the fraction-rounded-
         up integer.). Repeat Step 1.  

   Step 1: RB1 tries to send an MTU-probe padded to the size X.   

   1) If RB1 fails to receive an MTU-ack from RB2 after k tries, then: 

         X2 <-- X and X <-- [(X1 + X2)/2]

   2) If RB1 receives an MTU-ack to a probe of size X from RB2 then: 

         link MTU size <-- X, X1 <-- X and X <-- [(X1 + X2)/2]

   3) If X1 >= X2 or Step 1 has been repeated n times (where n is a
      configurable parameter whose default value is 5), stop. Else
      repeat Step 1.

   MTU testing is only done in the Designated VLAN [RFC7177]. Since the
   execution of the above algorithm can be resource consuming, it is
   recommended that the DRB take the responsibility to do the testing. 
   Multicast should be used instead of unicast when multiple RBridges
   are desired to respond with MTU-ack on the link. The Binary Search
   Algorithm is proposed here to minimize the probing attempts;
   therefore it reduces the number of multicast packets for MTU-probing.

   The following rules are designed to determine whether the
   aforementioned "Condition" holds.

   RBridges have figured out the upper bound (X2) and lower bound (X1)
   for the link MTU size from the execution of the above algorithm. If
 


Mingui Zhang, et al      Expires March 5, 2016                  [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT              MTU Negotiation            September 2, 2015


   the campus-wide Sz is smaller than the lower bound or greater than
   the upper bound, RBridges can directly judge whether the link
   supports the campus-wide Sz without MTU-probing.

   (a) If X1 >= campus-wide Sz. This link can support campus-wide Sz.

   (b) Else if X2 <= campus-wide Sz. This link cannot support campus-
       wide Sz.

   Otherwise, RBridges need to test whether the link can support campus-
   wide Sz:

   (c) X1 < campus-wide Sz < X2. RBridges need probe the link with MTU-
       probe messages padded to campus-wide Sz. If an MTU-ack is
       received within k tries, this link can support campus-wide Sz.
       Otherwise, this link cannot support campus-wide Sz. Through this
       test, the lower bound and upper bound of link MTU size can be
       updated accordingly.

4. Refreshing Campus-Wide Sz

   RBridges may join or leave the campus, which may change the campus-
   wide Sz. The following recommendations are specified for refreshing
   the campus-wide Sz.

   1) When a new RBridge joins the campus and its
      originatingL1LSPBufferSize is smaller than current campus-wide Sz,
      reporting its originatingL1LSPBufferSize in its LSPs will cause
      other RBridges decrease their campus-wide Sz. Then the LSPs in the
      campus MUST be re-sized to be no greater than the new campus-wide
      Sz.

   2) When an RBrige leaves the campus and its
      originatingL1LSPBufferSize is equal to the campus-wide Sz, its
      LSPs are purged from the remaining campus after reaching MaxAge
      [ISIS]. The campus-wide Sz MAY be recalculated and MAY increase.
      In other words, while RB1 normally ignores link state information
      for any IS-IS unreachable [RFC7180bis] RBridge RB2,
      originatingL1LSPBufferSize is an exception. Its value, even from
      IS-IS unreachable RBridges, is used in determining Sz. 

   Frequent LSP "re-sizing" is harmful to the stability of the TRILL
   campus, so it should be dampened. Within the two kinds of resizing
   actions, only the upward resizing will be dampened. When an upward
   resizing event happens, a timer is set (this is a configurable
   parameter whose default value is 300 seconds). Before this timer
   expires, all subsequent upward resizing will be dampened. Of course,
   in a well-configured campus with all RBridges configured to have the
 


Mingui Zhang, et al      Expires March 5, 2016                  [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT              MTU Negotiation            September 2, 2015


   same originatingL1LSPBufferSize, no resizing will be necessary. It
   does not matter if different RBridges have different dampening timers
   or some RBridges re-size upward more quickly than others.

   If the refreshed campus-wide Sz is smaller than the lower bound or
   greater than the upper bound of the tested link MTU size, the
   resource consuming link MTU size testing can be avoided according to
   rule (a) or (b) specified in Section 3. Otherwise, RBridges need to
   test the link MTU size according to rule (c). But it's unnecessary to
   perform the link MTU size testing algorithm all over again.

5. Relationship between Port MTU, Lz and Sz

   When port MTU size is smaller than the local
   originatingL1SNPBufferSize of an RBridge (sort of a wrong
   configuration), this port should be explicitly disabled from the
   TRILL campus. On the other hand, when an RBridge receives an LSP or
   E-L1CS FS-LSP with size greater than the link-wide Lz or the campus-
   wide Sz but not greater than its port MTU size, this LSP should be
   processed normally and not discarded. If the size of an LSP is
   greater than the MTU size of a port over which it is to be
   propagated, no attempt shall be made to propagate this LSP over the
   port and an LSPTooLargeToPropagate alarm shall be generated [ISIS].

6. LSP Synchronization

   An RBridge participates in LSP synchronization on a link as soon as
   it has at least one adjacency on that link that has advanced to at
   least the 2-Way state [RFC7177]. On a LAN link, CSNP and PSNP PDUs
   are used for synchronization. On a point-to-point link, only PSNP are
   used.

   The CSNPs and PSNPs MUST be formatted in chunks of size at most the
   link-wide Lz but are processed normally if received larger than that.
   Since the link MTU size may not have been tested in the 2-Way state,
   link-wide Lz may be greater than the supported link MTU size. In that
   case, a CSNP or PSNP may be discarded. After the link MTU size is
   successfully tested, RBridges will begin to format these PDUs in the
   size no greater than it, therefore these PDUs will eventually get
   through.

   Note that the link MTU size is frequently greater than the campus-
   wide Sz. Link local PDUs are formatted in the size of link MTU size
   rather than the campus-wide Sz, which promises a reduction in the
   number of PDUs and a faster LSP synchronization process.

7. Recommendations for Traffic Link MTU Size Testing

 


Mingui Zhang, et al      Expires March 5, 2016                  [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT              MTU Negotiation            September 2, 2015


   Campus-wide Sz and link-wide Lz are used to limit the size of most
   TRILL IS-IS PDUs. They are different from the MTU size restricting
   the size of TRILL data packets. The size of a TRILL data packet is
   restricted by the physical MTU of the ports and links the packet
   traverses. It is possible that a TRILL data packet successfully gets
   through the campus but its size is greater than the campus-wide Sz or
   link-wide Lz values. 

   The algorithm defined in link MTU size testing can also be used in
   TRILL traffic MTU size testing; in that case the link-wide Lz used in
   that algorithm should be replaced by the port MTU of the RBridge
   sending MTU probes. The successfully tested size X can be advertised
   as an attribute of this link using MTU sub-TLV defined in [RFC7176]. 

   Unlike RBridges, end stations do not participate in the exchange of
   ISIS PDUs of TRILL, therefore they cannot grasp the traffic link MTU
   size from a TRILL campus automatically. An operator may collect these
   values using network management tools such as TRILL ping or
   TraceRoute. Then the path MTU is set as the smallest tested link MTU
   on this path and end stations should not generate frames that, when
   encapsulated as TRILL Data packets, exceed this path MTU.

8. Backwards Compatibility

   There can be a mixture of Lz-ignorant and Lz-aware RBridges on a
   link. This will act properly although it will not be as efficient as
   it would be if all RBridges on the link are Lz-aware.

   At the side of an Lz-aware RBridge, in case that link-wide Lz is
   greater than campus-wide Sz, larger link-local TRILL IS-IS PDUs can
   be sent out to gain efficiencies. Lz-ignorant RBridges as receivers
   will have no problem handling them since the
   originatingL1LSPBufferSize value of these RBridges had been reported
   and the link-wide Lz is not greater than that value.

   At the side of an Lz-ignorant RBridge, TRILL IS-IS PDUs are always
   formatted not greater than the campus-wide Sz. Lz-aware RBridges as
   receivers can handle these PDUs since they cannot be greater than the
   link-wide Lz.

   An Lz-ignorant RBridge does not support the link MTU testing
   algorithm defined in Section 3 but may be using some algorithm just
   to test for Sz MTU on the link. In any case, if an RBridge per
   [RFC6325] receives an MTU-probe, it MUST respond with an MTU-ack
   padded to the same size as the MTU-probe. So the extension of TRILL
