Abstract 
    
   iSCSI is a SCSI transport protocol that maps the SCSI family of 
   protocols onto TCP/IP.  This document defines an additional iSCSI 
   node name type format to enable use of the "Network Address 
   Authority" (NAA) world wide naming format used by ANSI T11 Fibre 
   Channel (FC) protocols.

1. Introduction 
    
   This document discusses the motivation for adding an NAA type format 
   as an iSCSI node name format and defines this format in accordance 
   with the iSCSI naming conventions conventions [iSCSI]. It is hoped 
   that defining this format would enable storage devices containing 
   both iSCSI and FC ports to use the same NAA-based SCSI device name.. 

    
2. Motivation 
    
   To date, there are a number of networked transports providing port 
   services to SCSI.  These transports all incorporate some form of 
   world-wide unique name construction format. 
    
       SCSI transport protocol      Name Format   
    -----------------------------------------------
   |                            | EUI-64| NAA |IQN |
   |----------------------------|-------|-----|----|
   |    iSCSI (Internet SCSI)   |   X   |     | X  |
   |----------------------------|-------|-----|----|
   |     FCP (Fibre Channel)    |       |  X  |    |
   |----------------------------|-------|-----|----|
   | SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) |       |  X  |    |
   |----------------------------|-------|-----|----|
   |    SRP (for InfiniBand)    |   X   |     |    |
    -----------------------------------------------


   The NAA format is used by the Fibre Channel transport and the SAS 
   protocol made a recent decision to use NAA identifier formats.  This 
   makes the NAA format the most commonly used identifier format for 
   SCSI transports.  Although one of the FC-defined NAA formats contains 
   a mapping of EUI-64 numbers, it requires some mathematical

   manipulation to extract the EUI-64 identifier out of this format, and 
   the NAA EUI-64 mapping reserves 2 bits in the EUI-64 identifier, 
   thereby reducing the EUI-64 namespace.  If iSCSI included a naming 
   format that allowed direct representation of an NAA-format name, it 
   would facilitate construction of a target device name that translates 
   easily across multiple namespaces for a storage device containing 
   ports served by different transports. 
    
   This document proposes adding an NAA type to the iSCSI naming formats 
   in order to enable economy of worldwide-unique identifier assignment 
   for multi-transport-enabled target devices: One NAA-type SCSI device 
   name can be chosen for a target having SAS SCSI ports, FC SCSI ports 
   and iSCSI SCSI ports.  [Note: Today, FCP-2 does not have a dependable 
   notion of SCSI device name.  It is however expected that FCP-3 is 
   likely to incorporate the idea of a device name, or platform name, 
   subject to T10's decisions. If it does embrace the device name 
   notion, the same NAA format could then form the basis for targets 
   with SAS/FCP-3/iSCSI ports.] 
    
   In addition, there is a currently a movement in T10 to define and 
   report a single SCSI target device name (based on iSCSI's naming 
   formats), especially when the SCSI device has multiple transports 
   attached.  This discussion arose as a result of a proposed change to 
   SPC-3 (T10/02-419r0: SPC-3 iSCSI device identifiers) that adds a 
   device name to VPD page 83 device identifier page. Addition of the 
   ANSI T11-defined NAA format as an allowed type for iSCSI name 
   creation would make the iSCSI device naming format more palatable 
   across all current SCSI networked transports, allowing the creation 
   of SCSI device names that are transport-independent.  Additionally, a 
   single SCSI device name (regardless of transport) would allow 
   creation of LU names based on this SCSI device name. 
    
   The FC NAA formatted as an ASCII-hexadecimal representation has a 
   maximum size of 32 characters (128 bit formats) - as a result there 
   is no issue with this name format exceeding the maximum size for 
   iSCSI node names. 
    
3. iSCSI Name Structure  
    
   In addition to the iSCSI name types of "iqn." and "eui." 
    
     type "naa." - the remainder of the string is an ANSI T10 defined 
                  Network Address Authority identifier in ASCII-encoded 
                  hexadecimal.  
    
3.1  Type "naa." - Network Address Authority

                      iSCSI NAA Naming Format          February 2003 


   The ANSI T10 FC-FS specification defines a format for constructing 
   globally unique identifiers [FC-FS] referred to as an Network Address 
   Authority (NAA) format.  
   The iSCSI name format is "naa." followed by an NAA identifier (ASCII-
   encoded hexadecimal digits). 
    
      Example iSCSI name with a 64-bit NAA value:  

         Type  NAA identifier (ASCII-encoded hexadecimal) 
         +--++--------------+  
         |  ||              |  

         naa.52004567BA64678D  

      Example iSCSI name with a 128-bit NAA value:  

         Type  NAA identifier (ASCII-encoded hexadecimal) 
         +--++------------------------------+  
         |  ||                              |  

         naa.62004567BA64678D0123456789ABCDEF  

   The NAA iSCSI name format might be used in an implementation where 
   the structure for generating FC NAA worldwide unique names is already 
   in place because the device contains both Fibre Channel and iSCSI 
   SCSI ports. 
    
4. Terminology 
4.1 IQN 
   iSCSI qualified name, an identifier format defined by the iSCSI 
   protocol [iSCSI]. 
    
4.2 SRP 
   SCSI RDMA Protocol.  SRP defines a SCSI protocol mapping onto the 
   InfiniBand (tm) Architecture and/or functionally similar cluster 
   protocols [SRP]. 
    
4.3 SAS 
   Serial Attached SCSI. The Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) draft standard 
   contains both a physical Layer that is compatible with Serial ATA and 
   protocols for transporting SCSI commands to SAS devices and for 
   transporting ATA commands to SATA devices [SAS]. 
    
4.4 NAA 
   Network Address Authority - a naming format defined by the ANSI T11 
   Fibre Channel protocols [FC-FS].

4.5 InfiniBand 
   An I/O architecture intended to replace PCI and address high 
   performance server interconnect [IB]. 
    
Security Considerations 
    
   Because this document does not define any new wire protocol, there 
   are no additional security considerations for the iSCSI protocol.
