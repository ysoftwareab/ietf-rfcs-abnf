Internet-Draft   IP option for Sip to decide the destination  July,2007


Abstract

   Today,a MN has so many address can be used to be connected in a sip
[1]communication. Which one is better for the use in the specific 
environment?This draft provide a mechnism to do this by introducing a 
new sdp[2] suboption.

Internet-Draft   IP option for Sip to decide the destination  July,2007


1.  Introduction

   Today,a MN maybe have many address. Some of them is used in one 
   network,but others are used in another network.
   Focus on the Mip technology,it provide two addresses to MN at least.
   One is for visit network,named care-of-address,and another is for 
   home network,named home address.
   To IPv6 terminal,that care-of-address is just the co-located address.
   Meanwhile,if we use some other technology,such as the dual anchor 
   technology,then there is maybe another home address or a simple IP
   address is available to this termial.
   So much addresses are used in difference network scope.For example,
   care-of-address is used in visited network and home address is used
   in home network,and so on.
   So considering the MN's location,then it is the best if we can use 
   difference address to difference service in difference network scope.
   This will bring a significant advance in the receiving of service.



1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 RFC 2119
   [STANDARDS].

2.  Overview

   To the two parties in a sip communication,we can specify the address
   of each other in sdp to let the other know where the communication 
   should to be established.
   Faced to so many difference IP address of a MN,we can design a 
   mechanism to let the parties in a sip communication can find and 
   decide which address is more fit the environment of that 
   communication. And then to use it.
   Generally,this mechanism need the transport of those ip address 
   informations, the decision of which ip address to be used,and others
   need to be considered.
   In this draft,we introduce a mechanism to achieve this goal.

3.  The IP address Suboption

   To make a decision among those difference IP address of a MN for a 
   specific sip communication,we can define a IP address suboption in 
   sdp to describe these information.
   In this suboption,there will include the necessary information here.
   Generally, the combination of ip address,port,location infomation 
   will be included.

4.  Application scenarios
   
   In the following,we discuss some typical application scenario to
   explain the use of this suboption.

   4.1 In mip scenario
   In the mip scenario,this suboption will just like the following:
   
  	id: The index of this item in the suboption.
        ip address:the ip address ,that format can be digital or FQDN.
        port:The communication can be used in this ip address.
        address type:the type of this ip address.Such as:HoA or CoA.

   
   To the specific format of this suboption and it's TLV can be defined
   more exactly later.
  
   4.2 In dual anchor scenario
   In dual anchor scenario,this suboption can very similiar with that 
   above.
   
   But to the detail explanation of the difference field in that 
   suboption,we can define the address type to specific the specific 
   network scope.
   
   For example, we can use the network domain name to describe it.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations to this mechanism follow what we have 
   had to use for sip&sdp protocol at now.Of course,when we need to 
   provide seperatelly a specific security protection,we can do that
   in the future.

6.  Conclusions

   At now MN have some many difference ip addresses are used to be 
   communicated in difference scope.In difference environment,diffenerce
   ip address can be apply to make the communication more efficency.So 
   we can use this mechanism to interactive between the peers of a sip
   communication to share their ip addresses information and make a 
   decision to use the best one to communicate each other.
