1.  Introduction

   This document describes a YANG [RFC7950] data model for the BGP
   [RFC4271] protocol, including various protocol extensions, policy
   configuration, as well as defining key operational state data,
   including Routing Information Base (RIB).  The model is intended to
   be vendor-neutral, in order to allow operators to manage BGP
   configuration in heterogeneous environments with routers supplied by
   multiple vendors.  The model is also intended to be readily mapped to

   existing implementations to facilitate support from as large a set of
   routing hardware and software vendors as possible.

1.1.  Goals and approach

   The model covers the base BGP features that are deployed across major
   implementations and the common BGP configurations in use across a
   number of operator network deployments.  In particular, this model
   attempts to cover BGP features defined in BGP [RFC4271], BGP
   Communities Attribute [RFC1997], BGP Route Reflection [RFC4456],
   Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4 [RFC4760], Autonomous System
   Confederations for BGP [RFC5065], BGP Route Flap Damping [RFC2439],
   Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP [RFC4724], and BGP Prefix Origin
   Validation [RFC6811].

   Along with configuration of base BGP features, this model also
   addresses policy configuration, by providing "hooks" for applying
   policies, and also defining BGP-specific policy features.  The BGP
   policy features are intended to be used with the general routing
   policy model defined in A YANG Data Model for Routing Policy
   Management [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model].  The model conforms to the
   NMDA [RFC8342] architecture and has support for configuring
   Bidirectional Forward Detection (BFD) [RFC5880] for fast next hop
   liveliness check.

   For the base BGP features, the focus of the model described in this
   document is on providing configuration and operational state
   information relating to:

   o  The global BGP instance, and neighbors whose configuration is
      specified individually, or templated with the use of peer-groups.

   o  The address families that are supported by peers, and the global
      configuration which relates to them.

   o  The policy configuration "hooks" and BGP-specific policy features
      that relate to a neighbor - controlling the import and export of
      NLRIs.

   o  RIB contents.

   As mentioned earlier, any configuration items that are deemed to be
   widely available in existing major BGP implementations are included
   in the model.  Additional, more esoteric, configuration items that
   are not commonly used, or only available from a single
   implementation, are omitted from the model with an expectation that
   they will be available in companion modules that augment or extend

   the current model.  This allows clarity in identifying data that is
   part of the vendor-neutral base model.

   Where possible, naming in the model follows conventions used in
   available standards documents, and otherwise tries to be self-
   explanatory with sufficient descriptions of the intended behavior.
   Similarly, configuration data value constraints and default values,
   where used, are based on recommendations in current standards
   documentation, or those commonly used in multiple implementations.
   Since implementations can vary widely in this respect, this version
   of the model specifies only a limited set of defaults and ranges with
   the expectation of being more prescriptive in future versions based
   on actual operator use.

2.  Model overview

   The BGP model is defined across several YANG modules and submodules,
   but at a high level is organized into six elements:

   o  base protocol configuration -- configuration affecting BGP
      protocol-related operations, defined at various levels of
      hierarchy.

   o  multiprotocol configuration -- configuration affecting individual
      address-families within BGP Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4
      [RFC4760].

   o  neighbor configuration -- configuration affecting an individual
      neighbor within BGP.

   o  neighbor multiprotocol configuration -- configuration affecting
      individual address-families for a neighbor within BGP.

   o  policy configuration -- hooks for application of the policies
      defined in A YANG Data Model for Routing Policy Management
      [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model] that act on routes sent (received)
      to (from) peers or other routing protocols and BGP-specific policy
      features.

   o  operational state -- variables used for monitoring and management
      of BGP operations.

   These modules also make use of standard Internet types, such as IP
   addresses and prefixes, autonomous system numbers, etc., defined in
   Common YANG Data Types [RFC6991].

2.1.  BGP protocol configuration

   The BGP protocol configuration model is organized hierarchically,
   much like the majority of router implementations.  That is,
   configuration items can be specified at multiple levels, as shown
   below.

   Users may specify configuration at a higher level and have it apply
   to all lower-level items, or provide overriding configuration at a
   lower level of the hierarchy.  Overriding configuration items are
   optional, with neighbor specific configuration being the most
   specific or lowest level, followed by peer-group, and finally global.

Internet-Draft               BGP YANG Model                   March 2019


   Global configuration options reflect a subset of the peer-group or
   neighbor specific configuration options which are relevant to the
   entire BGP instance.

   The model makes the simplifying assumption that most of the
   configuration items are available at all levels of the hierarchy.
   That is, very little configuration is specific to a particular level
   in the hierarchy, other than obvious items such as "group-name" only
   being available for the peer group-level config.  A notable exception
   is for sub-address family configuration where some items are only
   applicable for a given AFI-SAFI combination.

   In order to allow common configuration to be applied to a set of
   neighbors, all neighbor configuration options are available within a
   peer-group.  A neighbor is associated to a particular peer-group
   through the use of a peer-group leaf (which provides a reference to a
   configured item in the peer-group list).

   Address-family configuration is made available in multiple points
   within the model - primarily within the global container, where
   instance-wide configuration can be set (for example, global protocol
   parameters, the BGP best path route selection options, or global
   policies relating to the address-family); and on a per-neighbor or
   per-peer-group basis, where address-families can be enabled or
   disabled, and policy associated with the parent entity applied.
   Within the afi-safi container, generic configuration that applies to
   all address-families (e.g., whether the AFI-SAFI is enabled) is
   presented at the top-level, with address-family specific containers
   made available for options relating to only that AFI-SAFI.  Within
   the current revision of the model a generic set of address-families,
   and common configuration and state options are included - further
   work is expected to add additional parameters to this area of the
   model.

   The following address-families are currently supported by the model:

2.2.  Policy configuration overview

   The BGP policy configuration model augments the generic YANG routing
   policy model described in A YANG Data Model for Routing Policy
   Management [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model], which represents a
   condition-action policy framework for routing.  This model adds BGP-
   specific conditions (e.g., matching on the community attribute), and
   actions (e.g., setting local preference) to the generic policy
   framework.

   Policies that are defined in the routing-policy model are referenced
   in multiple places within the model:

   o  within the global instance, where a policy applies to all address-
      families for all peers.

   o  on a global AFI-SAFI basis, where policies apply to all peers for
      a particular address-family.

   o  on a per-peer-group or per-neighbor basis - where the policy
      applies to all address-families for the particular group or
      neighbor.

   o  on a per-afi-safi basis within a neighbor or peer-group context,
      where the policy is specific to the AFI-SAFI for a a specific
      neighbor or group.

2.3.1.  Local Routing

   The loc-rib is the main BGP routing table for the local routing
   instance, containing best-path selections for each prefix.  The loc-
   rib table may contain multiple routes for a given prefix, with an
   attribute to indicate which was selected as the best path.  Note that
   multiple paths may be used or advertised even if only one path is
   marked as best, e.g., when using BGP add-paths.  An implementation
   may choose to mark multiple paths in the RIB as best path by setting
   the flag to true for multiple entries.

2.3.2.  Pre updates per-neighbor

   The adj-rib-in-pre table is a per-neighbor table containing the NLRI
   updates received from the neighbor before any local input policy
   rules or filters have been applied.  This can be considered the 'raw'
   updates from a given neighbor.

2.3.3.  Post updates per-neighbor

   The adj-rib-in-post table is a per-neighbor table containing the
   routes received from the neighbor that are eligible for best-path
   selection after local input policy rules have been applied.

2.3.4.  Pre route advertisements per-neighbor

   The adj-rib-out-pre table is a per-neighbor table containing routes
   eligible for sending (advertising) to the neighbor before output
   policy rules have been applied.

2.3.5.  Post route advertisements per-neighbor

   The adj-rib-out-post table is a per-neighbor table containing routes
   eligible for sending (advertising) to the neighbor after output
   policy rules have been applied

3.  Relation to other YANG data models

   The BGP model augments the Routing Management model A YANG Data Model
   for Routing Management [RFC8349] which defines the notion of routing,
   routing protocols, routing instances, or VRFs, and RIBs.

4.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].  The NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers three URIs and three YANG modules.

5.1.  URI Registration

   in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688] [RFC3688].  Following the format
   in RFC 3688, the following registration is requested to be made:

   Registrant Contact: The IESG.  XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML
   namespace.

5.2.  YANG Module Name Registration

   This document registers three YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry YANG [RFC6020].

   name: ietf-bgp
   namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-bgp
   prefix: bgp
   reference: RFC XXXX

   name: ietf-bgp-policy

   name: ietf-bgp-types
   namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-bgp-types
   prefix: bt
   reference: RFC XXXX

6.  YANG modules

   The modules comprising the BGP configuration and operational model
   are described by the YANG modules and submodules in the sections
   below.

   The main module, ietf-bgp.yang, includes the following submodules:

   o  ietf-bgp-common - defines the groupings that are common across
      more than one context (where contexts are neighbor, group, global)

   o  ietf-bgp-common-multiprotocol - defines the groupings that are
      common across more than one context, and relate to multiprotocol
      BGP

   o  ietf-bgp-common-structure - defines groupings that are shared by
      multiple contexts, but are used only to create structural
      elements, i.e., containers (leaf nodes are defined in separate
      groupings)

Internet-Draft               BGP YANG Model                   March 2019


   o  ietf-bgp-global - groupings with data specific to the global
      context

   o  ietf-bgp-peer-group - groupings with data specific to the peer
      group context

   o  ietf-bgp-neighbor - groupings with data specific to the neighbor
      context

   o  ietf-bgp-rib - grouping for representing BGP RIB.

   Additionally, modules include:

   o  ietf-bgp-types - common type and identity definitions for BGP,
      including BGP policy

   o  ietf-bgp-policy - BGP-specific policy data definitions for use
      with [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model] (described in more detail
      Section 2.2)

7.  Structure of the YANG modules

   The YANG model can be subdivided between the main module for base
   items, types, policy data, and the RIB module.

    description
      "Defines a submodule for representing BGP routing table (RIB)
       contents.  The submodule supports 5 logical RIBs per address
       family:

       loc-rib: This is the main BGP routing table for the local routing
       instance, containing best-path selections for each prefix. The
       loc-rib table may contain multiple routes for a given prefix,
       with an attribute to indicate which was selected as the best
       path.  Note that multiple paths may be used or advertised even if
       only one path is marked as best, e.g., when using BGP
       add-paths.  An implementation may choose to mark multiple
       paths in the RIB as best path by setting the flag to true for
       multiple entries.

       adj-rib-in-pre: This is a per-neighbor table containing the NLRI
       updates received from the neighbor before any local input policy
       rules or filters have been applied.  This can be considered the
       'raw' updates from a given neighbor.

       adj-rib-in-post: This is a per-neighbor table containing the
       routes received from the neighbor that are eligible for
       best-path selection after local input policy rules have been
       applied.

       adj-rib-out-pre: This is a per-neighbor table containing routes
       eligible for sending (advertising) to the neighbor before output
       policy rules have been applied.

       adj-rib-out-post: This is a per-neighbor table containing routes
       eligible for sending (advertising) to the neighbor after output

8.  Examples

   This section tries to show some examples in how the model can be
   used.

8.1.  Creating BGP Instance

   This example shows how to enable BGP with the IPv4 unicast address
   family, while adding one network to advertise.
