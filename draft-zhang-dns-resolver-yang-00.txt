1. Introduction

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] data model for the management
   of DNS protocol.

   This data model includes configuration data and state data (status
   information and counters for the collection of statistics).

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119].

   The following terms are used within this document:

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  client

   o  configuration data

   o  server

   o  state data

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6020] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

   o  presence container

1.2. Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
   (read-write), and "ro" means state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
   means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
   marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
   shown.

2. Design of Data Model

   The goal of this document is to define a data model that provides a
   common user interface to the DNS Resolver protocol.  There is very
   information that is designated as "mandatory", providing freedom for
   vendors to adapt this data model to their respective product
   implementations.

2.1. Overview

   The DNS Resolver YANG module defined in this document is augmented to
   the DNS resolver, which is defined in RFC7317.

2.2. Resource Record

   In general, we expect a resolver to cache all static hostname-to-
   IpAddress mapping data. Each static mapping data is one resource
   record, it contains the hostname and the corresponding IP address.

   module: ietf-system-dns-resolver
   augment /sys:system/sys:dns-resolver:
      +--rw resource-record* [name]
         +--rw name       string
         +--rw address    inet:ip-address

4. Security Considerations

   The data model defined does not create any security implications.



5. IANA Considerations

   This draft does not request any IANA action.
