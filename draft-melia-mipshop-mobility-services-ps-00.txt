Abstract

   There are on-going activities in the networking community to develop
   solutions that aid in IP handover mechanisms between heterogeneous
   wired and wireless access systems including, but not limited to, IEEE
   802.21.  Intelligent access selection, taking into account link layer
   attributes, requires the delivery of a variety of different
   information types to the terminal from different sources within the
   network and vice-versa.  The protocol requirements for this
   signalling have both transport and security issues that must be
   considered.  The signalling must not be constrained to specific link
   types, so there is at least a common component to the signalling
   problem which is within the scope of the IETF.  This draft presents a
   problem statement for this core problem.

Internet-Draft              Mobility Services             September 2006


1.  Introduction

   This Internet Draft provides a problem statement for the exchange of
   information to support handover in heterogeneous link environments.
   This mobility support service allows more sophisticated handover
   operations by making available information about network
   characteristics, neighboring networks and associated characteristics,
   indications that a handover should take place, and suggestions for
   suitable target networks to which to handover.  The mobility support
   services work complementarily with IP mobility mechanisms to enhance
   the overall performance and usability perception.

   There are two key attributes to the handover support service problem
   for inter-technology handovers:

   1.  The Information and Information Exchange mechanism: this includes
       the information elements that describe the information, and any
       signalling exchanges that are required to support the transfer of
       these Information Elements.

   2.  The Underlying Transport: this supports the above Information
       Exchange between devices in the network.  The requirements on
       this transfer mechanism include transport issues, because of the
       volume of data to be sent, as well as discovery and security
       issues for this transport, as the signalling may cross
       administrative boundaries and is interdependent with AAA aspects.

   This draft has been motivated by on-going work within IEEE 802.21,
   but the following description intentionally describes the problem
   from a more general perspective.  This document represents the views
   of the authors, and does not represent the official view of IEEE
   802.21.

   The structure of this document is as follows.  Section 2 defines
   mobility services.  Section 3 introduces the protocol entities.
   Section 4 provides a simple model for the protocol entities involved
   in the signalling and their possible relationships.  Section 5
   describes a decomposition of the signalling problem into service
   specific parts and a generic transport part.  Section 5.2 describes
   more detailed requirements for the transport component.  Section 6
   provides security considerations, and Section 7 summarizes the
   conclusions and open issues.  The appendixes describe some
   applications of the mobility services.


2.  Definition of Mobility Services

   As mentioned in the introduction mobility (handover) support in

Internet-Draft              Mobility Services             September 2006


   heterogeneous wireless environments requires functional components
   located either in the mobile terminal or in the (access) network to
   exchange information and eventually to take decisions upon this
   information exchange.  For instance traditional host-based handover
   solutions could be complemented with more sophisticated network-
   centric solutions reducing terminal complexity.  Also, neighborhood
   discovery, potentially a complex operation in heterogeneous wireless
   scenarios, can result in a more simple step if implemented with an
   unified interface towards the access network.

   In this document the different supporting functions for handover
   management are generally referred as Mobility Services (MoS) having
   in common different requirements for the transport protocol.  These
   requirements and associated functionalities are the focus of this
   document


3.  Protocol Entities

   The following section provides an overview of the network entities
   that is expected to be involved in the signalling exchanges to
   support the handover operation.  The following abbreviations are used
   in this section:

   o  MN: mobile node

   o  NN: network node, intended to represent some device in the network
      (the location of the node e.g. in the access network, home network
      is not specified, and for the moment it is assumed that they can
      reside anywhere).

   o  EP: endpoint, intended to represent the terminating endpoints of
      the transport protocol used to support the signalling exchanges
      between nodes.

   o  MME: A Mobility Management Entity implements network selection and
      handover decision algorithms and utilizes mobility signaling
      protocols and other protocols that aid in mobility functions.
      Generalizing, we call this functional entity Policy Decision Point
      which acts upon events and combines required actions with user
      profiles.  The MME is able to collect information either from
      other network nodes or from the MN.


4.  Deployment Scenarios

   The deployment scenarios are outlined in the following sections.
   Note: while MN-to-MN signalling exchanges are theoretically possible,

   these are not currently being considered, and are out-of-scope.

   The following scenarios are discussed for understanding the overall
   problem of transporting MIH protocol and is not intended to show the
   scenarios are part of the requirements in the transport design.

4.1.  End-to-End Signalling and Transport over IP

   In this case, the end-to-end signalling used to exchange the handover
   information elements (the Information Exchange) runs end-to-end
   between MN and NN.  The underlying transport is also end-to-end

           +------+                              +------+
           |  MN  |                              |  NN  |
           | (EP) |                              | (EP) |
           +------+                              +------+
                        Information Exchange
               <------------------------------------>

               /------------------------------------\
              <          Transport over IP           >
               \------------------------------------/

               Figure 1: End-to-end Signalling and Transport

4.2.  End-to-End Signalling and Partial Transport over IP

   As before, the Information Exchange runs end-to-end between the MN
   and the second NN.  However, in this scenario, some other transport
   means is used from the MN to the first NN, and the transport over IP
   is used only between NNs.  This is analogous to the use of EAP end-
   to-end between Supplicant and Authentication Server, with an upper-
   layer multihop protocol such as RADIUS used as a backhaul transport
   protocol between an Access Point and the Authentication Server.

                        Figure 2: Partial Transport

4.3.  End-to-End Signalling with a Proxy

   In the final case, a number of proxies are inserted along the path
   between the two transport endpoints.  The use of proxies is possible
   in both cases 1 and 2 above, but distinguished here as there are a
   number of options as to how the proxy may behave with regard to the
   transport and end-to-end signalling exchange.

   In this case, the proxy performs some processing on the Information
   Exchange before forwarding the information on.  This can be viewed as
   concatenating signalling exchanges between a number of EPs.

              \---------------/     \----------------/

                  Figure 3: Information Exchange Approach

   The Proxy NN processes all layers of the protocol suite in the same
   way as an ordinary EP.

   There is a possibility for realizing other proxy scenarios.

4.4.  End-to-End Network-to-Network Signalling

   In this case NN to NN signalling is envisioned.  Such model should
   allow different network components to gather information from each
   other.  This is useful for instance in conditions where network
   components need to take decisions and instruct mobile terminals of
   operation to be executed.

   Network nodes exchange information about connected terminals status.


5.  Solution Components

   Figure 5 shows a model where the Information Exchanges are
   implemented by a signalling protocol specific to a particular
   mobility service, and these are relayed over a generic transport
   layer (the Mobility Service Transport Layer).

   The Mobility Service Transport Layer provides certain functionality
   (outlined in Section 5.2) to the higher layer mobility support
   services in order to support the exchange of information between
   communicating mobility service functions.  The transport layer
   effectively provides a container capability to mobility support
   services, as well as any required transport and security operations
   required to provide communication without regard to the protocol
   semantics and data carried in the specific mobility services.

   The Mobility Support Services themselves may also define certain
   protocol exchanges to support the exchange of service specific
   Information Elements.  It is likely that the responsibility for
   defining the contents and significance of the Information Elements is
   the responsibility of other standards bodies other than the IETF.
   Example mobility services include the Information Services, Event and
   Command services.

5.1.  Payload Formats and Extensibility Considerations

Internet-Draft              Mobility Services             September 2006


   The format of the Mobility Service Transport Protocol is as follows:

   +----------------+----------------------------------------+
   |Mobility Service|           Opaque Payload               |
   |Transport Header|     (Mobility Support Service)         |
   +----------------+----------------------------------------+

                       Figure 6: Protocol Structure

   The opaque payload encompasses the Mobility Support Service
   information that is to be transported.  The definition of the
   Mobility Service Transport Header is something that is best addressed
   within the IETF.

   There are a number of issues with regard to the Mobility Support
   Service header and payload definition.  These include:

   1.  Responsibility for defining the header: where should the contents
       of the Mobility Support Service header be defined, and should
       there be one or multiple header definitions (i.e. will a common
       header definition for all mobility support services be
       adequate?).  Where there are commonalities, it may indicate that
       these aspects should actually be included in the Mobility Service
       Transport Header.

   2.  Payload Format: the format or the Mobility Support Service Data
       payload could be represented in a number of formats, e.g.  TLV,
       ASN/1, XML or text.  Ideally, a single payload representation
       should be defined, as support for multiple formats leads to
       unnecessary complexity.  It is expected that a set of Data
       Objects will be defined for the Mobility Support Services to
       exchange.

   3.  Sharing of Data Objects: which refers to sharing the definitions
       of Data Objects between Mobility Support Services, e.g. if a
       Capabilities object is defined that is used by multiple Mobility
       Support Services, should the same definition be used by all of
       them.  If this is the case, then a common identifier space is
       needed to identify the different Data Objects.  There is a
       question about where the definition of Data Objects and the
       management of the identifier space should take place.

   The answers to some of the above issues may in part depend on how
   many standards groups are interested in defining their own Mobility
   Support Services.

5.2.  Requirements on the Mobility Service Transport Layer

   The following section outlines some of the general transport
   requirements that should be supported by the Mobility Service
   Transport Protocol.  Analysis has suggested that at least the
   following need to be taken into account:

   Discovery  MNs need the ability to locate nodes that support
      particular mobility services in the network.  There are no
      assumptions about the location of these mobility services within
      the network, therefore the discovery mechanism needs to operate
      across administrative boundaries.  Issues such as speed of
      discovery, protection against spoofing, when discovery needs to
      take place, and the length of time over which the discovery
      information may remain valid all need to be considered.
      Approaches include:

      *  Hard coding information into the MN, indicating either the IP
         address of the NN, or information about the NN that can be
         resolved onto an IP address.  The configuration information
         could be managed dynamically, but assumes that the NN is
         independent of the access network to which the MN is currently
         attached.

      *  Pushing information to the MN, where the information is
         delivered to the MN as part of other configuration operations,
         for example, in a Router Discovery exchange.  The benefit of
         this approach is that no additional exchanges with the network
         would be required, but the limitations associated with
         modifying these protocols may limit applicability of the
         solution.

      *  MN dynamically requesting information about a service, which
         may require both MN and NN support for a particular service
         discovery mechanism.  This may require additional support by
         the access network (e.g. multicast or anycast) even when it may
         not be supporting the service directly itself.

      Numerous directory and configuration services already exist, and
      reuse of these mechanisms may be appropriate.  There is an open
      question about whether multiple methods of discovery would be
      needed, and whether NNs would also need to discover other NNs.
      The definition of a service also needs to be determined, including
      the granularity of the description (for example, should the MN
      look for an "IS" service, or "IS-local information", and "IS-home
      network information" services.

Internet-Draft              Mobility Services             September 2006


   Information from a trusted source:  The MN uses the Mobility Service
      information to make decisions about what steps to take next.  It
      is essential that there is some way to ensure that the information
      received is from a trustworthy source.  This includes cases where
      trusted proxies along the path have access to, and may modify,
      parts of the Mobility Service information.  This requirement
      should reuse trust relationships that have already been
      established in the network, for example, on the relationships
      established by the AAA infrastructure after a mutual
      authentication, or on the certificate infrastructure required to
      support SEND.

   Low latency:  Some of the Mobility Services generate time sensitive
      information.  Therefore, there is a need to deliver the
      information over quite short timescales, and the required lifetime
      of a connection might be quite short lived.  For reliable
      delivery, short-lived connections could be set up as and when
      needed, although there is a connection setup latency associated
      with this approach.  Alternatively, a long-lived connection could
      be used, but this requires advanced warning of being needed and
      some way to maintain the state associated with the connection.  It
      also assumes that the relationships between devices supporting the
      mobility service are fairly stable.  Another alternative is
      connectionless operation, but this has interactions with other
      requirements such as reliable delivery.

   Reliability:  Reliable delivery for some of the mobility services may
      be essential, but it is difficult to trade this off against the
      low latency requirement.  It is also quite difficult to design a
      robust, high performance mechanism that can operate in
      heterogeneous environments, especially one where the link
      characteristics can vary quite dramatically.  There are two main
      approaches that could be adopted:

      1.  Assume the transport cannot be guaranteed to support reliable
          delivery.  In this case, the Mobility Support Service itself
          will have to provide some sort of reliability mechanism to
          allow communicating endpoints to acknowledge receipt of
          information.

      2.  Assume the underlying transport will deal with most error
          situations, and provide a very basic acknowledgement mechanism
          that (if no acknowledgement is received) will indicate that
          something more serious has occurred than a packet drop (since
          these other types of error conditions are dealt with at the
          transport layer).

      Option 1 has a number of disadvantages associated with it, namely



Hepworth, et al.         Expires March 15, 2007                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft              Mobility Services             September 2006


      that ultimately the protocol design ends up re-inventing a lot of
      the functionality already available in lower layers at a higher
      layer where access to information about what is going on in the
      network is restricted.  For example, how will the higher layer
      determine the cause of the error, if a message is lost due to
      network congestion, it is pointless sending the message again.  It
      also adds to the complexity of the higher layer protocol, and
      makes successful deployment less certain (the protocol will have
      to be trialed in a number of network situations instead of re-
      using a protocol that has already been tested).

   Congestion Control:  A Mobility Service may wish to transfer large
      amounts of data, placing a requirement for congestion control in
      the transport.  There is an interaction between this requirement
      and that of the requirement for low latency since ways to deal
      with timely delivery of smaller asynchronous messages around the
      larger datagrams is required (mitigation of head of line blocking
      etc.).

   Secure delivery:  The Mobility Service information must be delivered
      securely between trusted peers, where the transport may pass
      though untrusted intermediate nodes and networks.  Design
      considerations include whether session based or host based
      security associations are required along the chain of NNs, and
      what the rate limitation requirements of requests/responses might
      be.

   Multiplexing:  The transport service needs to be able to support
      different mobility services.  This may require multiplexing and
      the ability to manage multiple discovery operations and peering
      relationships in parallel.

   Multihoming:  For some information services exchanged with the MN,
      there is a possibility that the request and response messages can
      be carried over two different links e.g. a handover command
      request is on the current link while the response could be
      delivered on the new link.  Depending on the IP mobility
      mechanism, there is some impact on the transport option for the
      mobility information services.  This may potentially have some
      associated latency and security issues, for example, if the
      transport is over IP there is some transparency but Mobile IP may
      introduce additional delay and both TCP and UDP must use the
      permanent address of the MN.

   In addition to the above, it may be necessary for the transport to
   support multiple applications (or modes of operation) to support the
   particular requirements of the Information Exchange being carried out
   between nodes.  This may require the ability to multiplex multiple

Internet-Draft              Mobility Services             September 2006


   information exchanges into a single transport exchange.

   Further information about transport requirements related to specific
   Mobility Services can be found in the different appendixes.


6.  Security Considerations

   Network supported mobility services aim at improving decision making
   and management of dynamically connected hosts.  The control and
   maintenance of mobile nodes becomes challenging where authentication
   and authorization credentials used to access a network are
   unavailable for the purpose of bootstrapping a security association
   for handover services.

   Information Services may not require authorization of the client, but
   both event and command services must authenticate message sources,
   particularly if they are mobile.  Network side service entities will
   typically need to provide proof of authority to serve visiting
   devices.  Where signalling or radio operations can result from
   received messages, significant disruption may result from processing
   bogus or modified messages.  The effect of processing bogus messages
   depends largely upon the content of the message payload, which is
   handled by the handover services application.  Regardless of the
   variation in effect, message delivery mechanisms need to provide
   protection against tampering, and spoofing.

   Sensitive and identifying information about a mobile device may be
   exchanged during handover service message exchange.  Since handover
   decisions are to be made based upon message exchanges, it may be
   possible to trace an user's movement between cells, or predict future
   movements, by inspecting handover service messages.  In order to
   prevent such tracking, message confidentiality should be available.
   This is particularly important since many mobile devices are
   associated with only one user, as divulgence of such information may
   violate the user's privacy.  Additionally, identifying information
   may be exchanged during security association construction.  As this
   information may be used to trace users across cell boundaries,
   identity protection should be available if possible, when
   establishing SAs.

   In addition, the user should not have to disclose its identity to the
   network (any more than it needed to during authentication) in order
   to access the Mobility Support Services.  For example, if the local
   network is just aware that an anonymous user with a subscription to
   operatorXYX.com is accessing the network, the user should not have to
   divulge their true identity in order to access the Mobility Support
   Services available locally.

Internet-Draft              Mobility Services             September 2006


   Finally, the network nodes themselves will potentially be subject to
   denial of service attacks from MNs and these problems will be
   exacerbated if operation of the mobility service protocols imposes a
   heavy computational load on the NNs.  The overall design has to
   consider at what stage (e.g. discovery, transport layer
   establishment, service specific protocol exchange) denial of service
   prevention or mitigation should be built in.


7.  Conclusions and Open Issues

   This Internet draft outlined a broad problem statement for the
   signalling of information elements across a network to support media
   independent handover services.  In order to enable this type of
   signalling service, a need for a generic transport solution with
   certain transport and security properties were outlined.  Whilst the
   motivation for considering this problem has come from work within
   IEEE 802.21, a desirable goal is to ensure that solutions to this
   problem are applicable to a wider range of mobility services.

   It would be valuable to establish realistic performance goals for the
   solution to this common problem (i.e. transport and security aspects)
   using experience from previous IETF work in this area and knowledge
   about feasible deployment scenarios.  This information could then be
   used as an input to other standards bodies in assisting them to
   design mobility services with feasible performance requirements.

   Much of the functionality required for this problem is available from
   existing IETF protocols or combination thereof.  This document takes
   no position on whether an existing protocol can be adapted for the
   solution or whether new protocol development is required.  In either
   case, we believe that the appropriate skills for development of
   protocols in this area lie in the IETF.

Appendix A.  Introduction to IEEE 802.21

   At this time, three broad classes of services for handover
   assistance, particularly aiming at improving the inter-technology,
   are under consideration within the IEEE 802.21 Working Group [1].
   They require passing of information within hosts, locally and between
   different hosts, remotely.  The services are Information Services
   (IS), Event Services (ES) and Command Services (CS).

A.1.  Information Services

   Information Services (IS) are one part of handover services used to
   provide network related information about the current or neighboring
   networks with same or different access link technology.  This allows
   the network or host to make informed decisions of which network to
   handover to or handover operations to undertake either in response to
   certain events, or when planning controlled or commanded handovers.
   The IS work complementary to the mobility management protocols in the
   capacity that they are utilized before making decisions for handovers
   in the aspect of network selection.

A.2.  Event Services

   Event Services (ES) provide indications from one layer or one
   functionality to another about status changes in the connectivity
   state.  This is particularly relevant to wireless interfaces.  It
   should be noted that the events of one link technology can be carried
   over current or another link technology.  Remote event service is a
   protocol exchange mechanism between two different network nodes to
   inform of ES.  The event notification can originate either from a
   mobile node or a node in the network.  Receipt and processing of an
   event belonging to the ES may generate a reaction in the receiving

Internet-Draft              Mobility Services             September 2006


   node (e.g. trigger IP layer mobility).

A.3.  Command Services

   Command Services (CS) provide mechanisms for controlling handovers or
   functions aiding handovers either locally or between two functions.
   They provide mechanisms to establish, redirect, or remove state in
   either the network or mobile node, so that handovers occur smoothly.
   Remote command service is a protocol exchange mechanism between
   network nodes to instruct the recipient network nodes to execute a
   specific function.  Execution of a command service at the mobile node
   or a node in the network may result in loss of current link
   connectivity and/or change in the network point of attachment.
   Receipt and processing of a command belonging to the CS generates an
   expected response in the receiving node (e.g. create a new link layer
   connection, disconnect a link layer connection, etc).


Appendix B.  Official IEEE 802.21 Requirements for IP-based transport

   o  The transport protocol must work regardless of the network
      location of the MIH Protocol Entity e.g. on the same subnet, or

   o  The discovery protocol must enable Firewall pass-through for IPv4
      and IPv6 networks.

   o  The security mechanism must provide a common security association
      (SA) negotiation method regardless of the network location of the

      reestablishment the SA due to host mobility.


Appendix C.  Enabling Event and Command Services

   This section analyzes the feasibility of remote events and commands,
   and describes a set of requirements to enable remote ES and CS.  The
   section discusses some potential solutions to solve some issues
   typically associated with remote events and explicit signaling.
   However, such solutions are discussed just to provide example of how
   drawbacks and limitations identified e.g. in [2] can be overcome.
   This section does not propose any specific solutions.

   [2] contains a set of observations on requirements that solutions
   need to fulfill to justify and enable transport of events between
   peer entities over the media (e.g. wireless link).  This section
   addresses these observations in order to assess the feasibility of

Internet-Draft              Mobility Services             September 2006


   remote ES and CS.

C.1.  Explicit Signaling for Remote Event/Command Services

   [2] indicates that alternatives not requiring explicit signaling are
   preferred, and that explicit signaling proposals must prove that
   existing implicit signaling mechanisms are inadequate.

   Implicit signaling (e.g. path change processing and link-aware
   routing metrics) has been considered for the scenarios described in
   this draft.  However, implicit signaling may not work in several
   cases of inter-technology handover.  As an example, in certain
   scenarios the handover is executed but the mobile node does not move
   between subnets (e.g. in 3GPP networks where the GGSN and the Packet
   Data Gateway (for WLAN interworking) are located in the same subnet).
   In other scenarios, explicit signaling is required between the mobile
   node and a network node to report events related to an access link
   different from the one currently being used by the mobile node (e.g.
   a mobile node using a 3GPP link detects the availability of a WLAN
   link).  Such events would not be visible to the network node without
   explicit signaling.

   Various wireless technologies already have defined mobility
   management solutions that deploy explicit signaling to support
   handover (e.g. 3GPP, 3GPP2, IEEE 802.16, etc.), or are at present
   developing new solutions (e.g.  IEEE 802.11 Fast BSS Transition).
   However, such solutions are clearly defined for intra-technology
   handover (e.g. 3GPP solutions apply to handover between 3GPP
   technologies).  However, none of these wireless technologies has
   defined a solution that is applicable to inter-technology handover
   (e.g. between different IEEE 802 access links, or between a 3GPP
   access link and an IEEE 802 access link).

C.2.  Mitigation of Security Issues and Validation of  Transported
      Indications

   The validity of the information delivered through explicit signaling
   in the Remote Event Service and the Remote Command Service is
   essential to guarantee that the mobile node or the network node make
   handover decision and perform handover based on valid conditions.  In
   [2] the issue of validity of the indications is correctly raised,
   since in a generic model the receiver of the indication (e.g. the
   mobile node) may not have the ability to verify if the indication has
   e.g. been sent by a host off the actual path in use, and therefore
   possibly not capable of providing accurate indications.

   With the specific model for Remote Event Services and Remote Command
   Services briefly described in this document and IEEE 802.21 [1], a

   "relationship" is generated between the mobile node and an MME
   through a process of discovery and registration.  Authentication can
   be part of such process (possibly mutual authentication), as
   described in the security considerations.  Considering this specific
   model, information in Remote Event Service and Remote Command Service
   are generated by a node with which the recipient of the Remote Event
   Service and Remote Command Service has setup a relationship before
   hand.  It is up to the recipient to ensure during the discovery and
   registration process that the source of Remote Event Service and
   Remote Command Service is reputable and can provide accurate
   information.  An example of how this can be achieved is based on
   authentication mechanisms and the adoption of a trust model similar
   to those adopted in current networks for authentication of roaming
   users.  The mobile node can authenticate with a home domain/network
   based on a subscription with such domain/network.  If the MME is
   located e.g. in the home realm, the MME can authenticate with the MME
   based on credentials the mobile node possesses as a result of the
   subscription.  If the MME is e.g. in the visited domain, a transitive
   trust model can be adopted, where the mobile node authenticates with
   the home domain/network based on a subscription and through the
   visited domain.  As a result, a security association is established
   between the mobile node and the MME.  A model similar to the one
   adopted in AAA can be adopted.

C.3.  Mapping of Identifiers

   [2] raises a legitimate issue regarding the fact that typically the
   IP layer, the link layer, the transport layer and the application
   layer use different identifiers, and therefore reporting of
   information regarding these layers to a remote node may require
   matching the various identifiers.




Hepworth, et al.         Expires March 15, 2007                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft              Mobility Services             September 2006


   When local event services generate indications within a host (e.g.
   the mobile node), the host has detailed knowledge of the various
   identifiers used at the different layers (e.g. the IP address, the
   MAC addresses for the various IEEE 802 accesses, etc.).  As depicted
   in Figure 7, an MIHF located in the mobile node can maintain a local
   mapping of the various identifiers.  When the mobile node discovers
   and registers with another network node (e.g. an MME), an identifier
   specific to Remote Event Services and Remote Command Services can be
   adopted to uniquely identify the mobile node , e.g. a Media
   Independent Host Identifier.  The Media Independent Host Identifier
   can be e.g. assigned to the mobile node by the home network as part
   of a set of subscription credentials.  The Media Independent Host
   Identifier could be a new identifier, or an existing identifier could
   be reused (e.g.  NAI).  Subsequently, all the remote even
   notifications and remote command exchanges can be based on the Media
   Independent Host Identifier, therefore limiting the need to maintain
   the mapping between different identifiers at different layers local
   to the host.


Appendix D.  Introduction to Network Initiated Handovers (NIHO)

   This section presents scenarios, functionalities and requirements for
   helping the handover procedure in heterogeneous environments.  The
   mobility services enable mobile terminals to collect a large variety
   of information as well as the network to instruct mobile devices to
   perform specific actions, such as handover.  Standards based IP
   mobility enabling protocols such as Mobile IP [3] [4], HIP [5],
   MOBIKE [6] are however all mobile node centric: the handover related
   decision making is mostly done in the mobile node only.  The goal of
   this section is to motivate the development of advanced procedures
   for network initiated handovers being part of the defined MoS.

   Public mobile network access is gaining increased diversity, both in
   terms of the types of access technologies, in terms of the diversity
   of the offer (with clear separation of roles between access and
   service providers), and in terms of the size of that offer.  This
   diversity has been compounded by increasing number of multi-access
   capable terminals equipped with IP technologies, and of operator-
   provided multi-technology mobile connection software.  Overall, this
   creates a complex environment, where the mobile terminal might not
   have enough information or even the possibility to make an
   intelligent handover decision (as is often the case of operator-
   provided software).  In fact, handover decisions and inherent target
   network selection is not necessarily anymore based on access
   availability but further depends on policies and commercial roaming
   arrangements on access network level, access provider level and
   service provider level.  Furthermore, the information required for an



Hepworth, et al.         Expires March 15, 2007                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft              Mobility Services             September 2006


   intelligent target network selection might change periodically with
   such a frequency that maintaining all knowledge (and intelligence) in
   the mobile node might not be viable anymore.  Some of this
   information is only available for network elements.  However, none of
   the mobility protocols above referred have capabilities or procedures
   to significantly involve network side entities in intelligent
   handover decision making.

   A good example of the type of information only available at network
   entities is radio resource usage.  It is expected that radio resource
   usage optimization will be a task of major relevance in future
   wireless network environments, with millions of users roaming between
   access routers across multiple technologies (i.e. 802.11, 802.16).
   This task can resort to mechanisms and algorithms able to gather
   measurements and force terminal handovers between cells.  The
   handover can be issued according to predefined mobility patterns,
   mechanisms for intelligent flow balancing, mechanisms for optimized
   resource re-allocation, mechanisms for user-traffic performance
   optimization, or mechanisms for user profiling (e.g. access rights) -
   all of them ultimately leading to better service to be provided to
   the users, with additional increased resource usage for the network
   operator.  For these expectations to be realized, network control
   capabilities are required to instruct specific terminals to perform
   handovers, either between access points or between different
   technologies.

   Going even further, handovers over administrative domains i.e. inter-
   domain handovers are not explicitly prohibited with the existing IP
   mobility enabling protocols, but at the same time these protocols are
   not designed or optimized for such cases in any way.  Also a general
   network controlled triggering mechanism for a handover from an
   administrative domain to another does not currently exists.

   This document describes various scenarios where handovers could be
   network initiated, even over administrative domains, presenting some
   ideas on functional components and protocol operations required to
   fulfill the above requirements.  This, however, will further require
   a new handover triggering mechanism that originates from entities
   located in the network side, and is acted upon by entities on the
   mobile node.  These network side entities may also be located in
   other administrative domains than the one the mobile node is
   currently visiting.  In Appendix E an example is provided on how IEEE
   802.21 can implement the required signalling.

D.1.  Definition of Network Initiated Handover

   As mentioned above, available solutions rely on the existence of
   triggers generated in the mobile terminal and conveyed to respective



Hepworth, et al.         Expires March 15, 2007                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft              Mobility Services             September 2006


   network components which then will take adequate actions.  However,
   recently we have been assisting to new different trends [7] where the
   serving radio access network issue handover preparation/execution by
   means of different events gathered at different levels (e.g. radio
   conditions, QoS requirements).  We therefore are required to define
   use cases in which the network takes active decisions without
   requiring the terminal to perform expensive operations.

   In this section by network initiated handover we identify the action
   taken in the network to initiate the handover based on:

   o  Link events originated in the mobile node.  In this case the
      terminal sends link events to the network.  The event might be
      generated because of radio variations, powering on of new network
      devices or new service requirements.  In all cases the measurement
      action is required to be performed also in critical conditions.
      For instance speed dynamic effects on terminal mobility have to be
      taken into account as well as variable round trip time.
      Positioning of the decision function is a critical issue.

   o  Events generated in the network for e.g. resource management
      reasons.  It should be noted that the Mobile Operator can initiate
      an handover procedure also based on location and current services.
      Multihoming scenarios can also be considered as part of the
      overall optimization problem.

   The action described is similar to exiting behavior of current GSM/3G
   systems.  Measurements are requested by the network and performed by
   the mobile terminal.  The results of these measurements, combined
   with current QoS conditions and other user profile requirements,
   could result in the execution of an handover.  Measurements are a key
   issue, for instance, in indoor wireless LANs environments, affected
   also by different user mobility patterns.

D.2.  Assumptions

   This document has some few fundamental assumptions concerning the
   general networking environment and network initiated handovers.  The
   rest of the document makes use of the following assumptions:

   o  Reusing existing security mechanisms -- The mobile node should
      reuse the existing security associations it created while
      establishing the initial access to the network and its mobility
      service provider (MSP).







Hepworth, et al.         Expires March 15, 2007                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft              Mobility Services             September 2006


   o  All mobile nodes within the scope of this document are expected to
      support at least one (potentially modified) existing or future IP
      mobility enabling protocol.  However, if a MN does not support
      network initiated handover functionality, the network might refuse
      to give service to that MN.

   o  All mobile nodes, correspondent nodes and mobility management
      nodes are not expected to understand or support network initiated
      and assisted handovers.  When either peer lacks support for
      network initiated and assisted handover triggering and signaling
      the peer supporting these features must fall back to the base IP
      mobility protocol mechanisms.

   o  The network initiated handover concept relies on the presence of a
      centralized functional entity.  This entity controls the network
      side and implement the intelligence to select nodes and targets
      access routers.  It is not in the scope of this document to
      specify the policies that will be implemented.

   o  To provide adequate scalable support, distributed functions are
      required to support the above functional entity.  This gives more
      flexibility to the overall architecture and protocol operation.

   o  It is envisioned the presence of multi wireless access, such as
      802.11, 802.16, UMTS, forming an heterogeneous composition of
      macro and micro cells.  The network support SHOULD leverage user
      mobility focusing on vertical handovers.  Hence, the terminal does
      not need to apply filtering criteria to select a target network
      (which could be an expensive operation in heterogeneous
      environments).  Solutions similar to the 3GPP interface between
      the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) and any application server, for
      downloading of filtering criteria at registration time, could be
      applied here - being the HSS a AAA backend, and the application
      server the MME.

   o  Performing network initiated handover has the main implication
      that the network has first to assess the terminal view of the
      network.  Signal level evaluation is a important matter when
      considering user mobility.  This is typically very well handled
      with terminal initiated handovers and automatic evaluation of
      signal level.  Different methods apply to different technologies.

   o  Neighborhood discovery relates to the above assumption when
      neighborhood scanning is requested from the network.  It is
      expected these functions to be available on the terminal side.

D.3.  NIHO Application Areas

   We foresee three possible application areas that are listed and
   briefly described in the following section.  Each application area
   uses the NIHO triggering and signaling as part of their tasks.

   o  Application for Mobility Reasons

      In this context user mobility is handled from the network side
      assisted by the mobile terminal.  This particular application
      requires network capabilities to request measurements and evaluate
      technologies specific link conditions.  The approach can be
      considered similar to what current mobile networks do.  The most
      challenging aspect is the freshness of the reported information.
      Particular scenarios, such as WLAN, could impose stringent
      requirements.

   o  Application for Resource Optimization Reasons

      As mentioned before, network optimization is a delicate issue when
      resources are scarce, especially in the wireless access network.
      Standards that able to support natively quality of services
      capabilities are becoming mature to be sold on the market
      (802.11e).  A cross layer design is therefore required to convey
      link layer specific information to decision points located in the
      access network.

      These decision points can combine standard admission control
      mechanisms with advanced NIHO functionalities, resulting in a new
      dimension of mobility management (i.e. more terminals can be
      granted with network access).

   o  Application for inter-domain handover

      Handovers that cause the mobile to cross administrative domain
      borders involve inter-domain signaling.  One example of this kind
      of scenario is when the mobile node moves between different NAPs
      under the same ISP or when even the ISP changes as a result of the
      movement.  In both of these scenarios the NIHO signaling could be
      used to prepare the new target domain (either ISP and/or NAP) for
      the arriving mobile node.  Especially if the handover was
      initiated from the network side, the handover initiating network
      could help distributing all security, policies, billing and
      service related material cross administrative domains before the
      mobile node arrives.

Appendix E.  NIHO with IEEE 802.21

   IS, ES and CS as defined in IEEE 802.21 WG can be used as enablers
   for network initiated and assisted handover scenarios between
   different access technologies.  The discussion of such scenarios in
   IP networks can easily raise a long list of questions regarding the
   feasibility of e.g. sending information in real-time between the
   mobile node and the MME, and of sending commands between the MME and
   the mobile node.  The issue considered in these cases is typically
   the delay that can be introduced by the transport and that may make
   the overall handover delay quite considerable.  This document does
   not discuss these specific issues, and does not argue in favor or
   against such issues.  However, in order to identify some of the
   scenarios of applicability for IS, ES and CS for network-controlled
   handover, we need to consider the following classification of
   handovers.  There are two main reasons to perform a handover:

   1.  degradation of current link/connection quality: the quality of
       the link is degrading and it is necessary to perform a handover
       to avoid losing the current connection;

   2.  "opportunistic" handover: due to a set of events and based on
       specific policies, it is preferable to move the communication to
       another link.

   In order to support inter-technology network-controlled handovers the
   first case, the delay between the moment the handover decision is
   made and the moment the command to perform the handover is received
   by the mobile node needs to be considered carefully.  However, for
   "opportunistic" handover the impact of such delay is less
   significant, since the mobile node is not having any degradation over
   the current link, and the handover will be performed because the
   network has policies indicating that it is preferable to move to the
   new link.

   One motivation for performing opportunistic network-controlled
   handover is load sharing, in scenarios where a network exercises
   tight control of various wireless link technologies to distribute the
   load of communications according to network policies.

   The network may perform a network-controlled handover decision in at
   least two steps.

   1.  Network selection, and

   2.  Handover control.

   The two steps are described in the following sections

E.1.  Network Selection

   Network selection is a process of selecting a favorable network for a
   mobile node to transfer or handover the ongoing services to the
   selected network.  The selected network may be a different link
   technology from the previous one.  It may also be possible that the
   mobile node, after handover, may not experience exactly the same
   level of QoS as the current link due to this network selection.  But,
   in general, it may result in some user benefit in one way or another
   e.g. cost savings, higher bandwidth etc.  MME in the network may have
   access to subscriber profile, contracts, and device capabilities to
   make use of the network selection algorithms for a certain subscriber
   or mobile node.

   Figure 8 shows a simple network selection procedure with the help of
   the mobile node.  This example call flow diagram employs remote event
   services and information services.  Remote command services are not
   used in this particular example, however, they can also be useful in
   the network selection mechanisms under certain scenarios.  E.g.
   depending on user geographical location, the network may command the
   mobile node to perform a scan for a specific 802.11 network and
   report the results that can be used in the network selection process.

   In the scenario shown, the mobile node initially performs a
   registration or attachment to the network on any link, e.g. 3GPP
   network.  The MME and the mobile node are able to discover each other
   in the same or following step.  MME may then register for specific
   remote event services, e.g.  ES-link-detect by sending a registration
   request and filter information for both 802.16 and 802.11 networks.
   The mobile node accepts the request with a positive reply.  From time
   to time, the mobile node may receive broadcast information from
   802.11 and 802.16 networks.  In this scenario, the 802.16 broadcast
   is received and a link-detect is sent by the 802.16 MAC layer to the
   MIHF.  The MIHF translates this to an ES-link-detect message to the
   MIHF implementing ES in the network (collocated in the MME) with the
   basic network information received in the broadcast.

   The MME requests for more information about the network via the IS
   query to another MIHF implementing IS to check the suitability of the
   detected network due to roaming agreements.  The MME decides that
   this particular 802.16 network is not a favorable network and takes
   no action.  The mobile node also takes no action and does not report
   the detection of same network more than once.  At a later time, the
   mobile node may receive beacon information from 802.11 AP and the MAC
   layer in the mobile node reports the to the MIHF along with the SSID
   information.  The MIHF provides this information to the MME in the
   network.  The MME may perform an IS query based on the SSID
   information and determines that this SSID belongs to a favorable

   handover signaling [8].  Here, the MME in the network utilizes MIHF
   implementing CS and generates a link switch command with CS-switch-
   req to the mobile node.  The parameters in the message may include
   that a make-before-break mechanism is to be performed along with the
   target link information e.g. 802.11 network as shown from the network
   selection procedure earlier.

   The MIHF indicates the Mobile IP function of the impending link
   switch along with new link information.  The Mobile IP functionality,
   If necessary, i.e., it does not have a valid Access Router Tuple-Info
   [RFC4068], it sends a Proxy Router Solicitation (PrRtrSol) with the
   new link information (e.g.  MAC address of AP) and the Proxy Router
   Advertisement (PrRtrAdv) provides the relevant L3 information for the
   mobile node to use on the new link.  The MIHF in the mobile node
   executes the command by sending an "associate" request to the 802.11
   MAC which will perform all necessary L2 association and
   authentication procedures for the new link.  For completeness, steps
   3 and 4 in Figure 9 can take place in parallel to steps 3 and 4.

   A link-up indication is sent to the interested parties including
   Mobile IP functionality.  Mobile IP sends a Fast Binding Update (FBU)
   to the old FA over the old link so that old FA could switch (tunnel)
   the packets to the new FA.  The mobile node now is able to receive
   packets from new FA that are tunneled from old FA.  At a later time,
   the mobile node performs an Mobile IP update procedure to update the
   binding in the HA and reroute the tunnels directly from HA to the new
   FA in the new network corresponding to the 802.11 link.  Once the
   traffic uses the new link, the MIHF releases the old link by sending
   a request to that MAC layer, here the 3GPP radio link.  A CS-switch-
   resp is sent back to the MME upon completion of the command.

   The following signaling flow shows how the network controlled handoff
   can work with fast MIP handover signaling [RFC4068].  It shows a
   make-before-break mechanism, so that the mobile node sends the FBU on
   the old link after the setup of the new link to minimize the latency
   due to L2 association and authentication procedures.  For
   completeness, steps 3 and 4 in Figure 9 can take place in parallel to
   steps 2 and 3.

Appendix F.  MIH services and (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples

   There are two kinds of handover modes in [8], which are classified
   based on whether mobile node has finished the IP layer related
   configuration before attaching to the new link of access router.  One
   kind of mode is called "Predictive Mode" at which IP layer
   configuration is finished before handover, and the other is called
   "Reactive mode".

   For both of the two handover modes, it is necessary for mobile node

   to know the information of neighboring access routers abbreviated as
   "AR-Info" in [8].  The "AR-Info" is comprised of router's L2 address,
   router's IP address and router's IP prefix.  Apart from "AR- Info",
   mobile node has to know the "AP-ID", the L2 link address of the
   imminent access point, which can be gotten during scanning
   processing.  As for mobile node, the key knowledge is the (AP-ID, AR-
   Info) tuple which contains an access router's L2 address and IP
   address, and the prefix valid on the interface to which the access
   point (identified by AP-ID) is attached.

   This section discusses the construction scenarios fo (AP-ID, AR-Info)
   tuples and how MIH services are applied to these construction
   scenarios.

F.1.  Construction Scenarios of (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples

   Three different deployment scenarios are outlined in this section as
   the following.  These scenarios are intended to specify functionality
   requirements for the candidate solutions, not to specify the
   architecture of solutions.

F.1.1.  Distributed application scenario for construction

     Figure 10: Reference model for distributed construction scenario

   Figure 10 depicts the reference model for heterogeneous network
   application scenario working at the distributed construction mode of
   (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples.  In this figure, three access routers with
   different functionalities are presented.  AR1 is an access router for
   802.11 WLAN, to which two access points are attach.  AR2 has two
   802.16 base stations attaching to its different down link, which
   plays a role of ASN Gateway.  AR3 is an access router running in the
   3G telecom networks, whose role may be PDSN in CDMA2000 network.  AR3
   has two Base Transceiver Stations attaching to its access link (in
   this figure, Base Station Controller connecting BTS and AR is
   omitted).

   When Fast Mobile IPv6 Protocol is applied in this heterogeneous
   network scenario, there are many factors implementing the
   construction of (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples, which should be considered
   carefully.  Detailed discussion is as the following.

F.1.1.1.  Construction of the AP-ID knowledge

   When access router is integrated with wireless interfaces (such as
   802.11 interfaces and 802.16 interfaces), it is very easy for access
   router to get to know L2 address of wireless interfaces.

   But, for AR1 and AR2 in figure1, the access points and base stations
   work independently of access router.  The access router can not get
   to know the L2 address of AP/BS's wireless interface easily.  In the
   simpler case, manual configuration can be used to construct the L2
   address knowledge of AP/BS for the access router.  More sophisticated
   solution is to run a dynamic discovering protocol by which access
   router and AP/BS can interwork and deliver useful information to each
   other.  If there is an existing protocol having this kind of ability,
   it can be used; otherwise new solution needs to be developed.  For
   different networks, the dynamic protocol is different; and the
   designing of the dynamic protocol is outside the scope of MIPSHOP
   working group.

   AR3 is a network node in 3G networks.  And BTS in 3G network works
   differently with that in 802 series network.  The great difference is
   that BTS has no L2 address while AP/BS in 802 series network does
   have (see [3GFH]).  To identify an access network in CDMA2000, the
   Access Network Identifier (ANID), which is composed of the System ID
   (SID), Network ID (NID) and Packet Zone ID (PZID) can be used,
   instead of using L2 address of AP/BS in 802 series wireless network.
   Because there are many BTSes attaching to the same access router, it
   is not easy for access router to get the knowledge about ANID.
   Similarly, both manual configuration and automatic discovering
   mechanism can be used to construct the ANID knowledge for the access
   router.

F.1.1.2.  Construction of (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples

   Having gotten to know the information about AP-IDs, the access router
   has to construct the associations used in Proxy Router Advertisement
   between AP-IDs and AR-Info.

   In nature, it's not difficult for access router to construct the
   associations.  No matter what construction mode of AP-IDs is used,
   AP- ID can be bound to a L3 interface which has its own information
   absolutely.

Internet-Draft              Mobility Services             September 2006


F.1.1.3.  Discovery of neighboring network access routers

   As for construction of (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples, Figure1 is a
   distributed reference model.  Different access router has to
   construct the repository of (AP-ID, AR-Info)s independently and
   serves for the mobile nodes attaching to its link.  Before access
   routers can exchange neighboring network information, they have to
   know each other.

   It is very difficult for access router to determine the neighboring
   network access routers.  For different deployment applications, the
   difference is great.  Maybe the access routers at the same
   geographical location are not neighboring network access routers even
   though there is a direct link between them (i.e. neighboring
   routers).  And maybe the access routers far from each other are
   neighboring network access routers even though there are many hops
   between them.

   In the simpler case, manual configuration can help access router
   determine neighboring network access routers.  But for the large
   scale telecom networks, the neighboring network relationship is very
   complicated.  And manual configuration can't be competent with this
   situation.

   More sophisticated solution is to use dynamic discovering protocol.
   There are many factors deserved to be considered carefully, which are
   outside the scope of this document.

F.1.1.4.  Selection of (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples to be exchanged

   In figure1, AR2 has four access sub-networks and AR3 has two.  In the
   real world, maybe there are more sub-networks attaching to the same
   access router.  So it's not necessary for neighboring network access
   routers to exchange all of the (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples.  More
   effective way is only to exchange overlay/neighboring sub-network
   information.  How to determine overlay/neighboring sub-networks is
   outside the scope of this document.

F.1.1.5.  Transportation of messages

   Transportation is performed between neighboring network access
   routers.  Different kinds of messages require kinds of service level
   agreement for transportation.  For example, management and control
   messages should be transported at reliability channel while (AP-ID,
   AR-Info) bearing messages require a fast and no guaranteed
   reliability one.  Besides, many general transportation functionality
   should be consider carefully, such as congestion avoidance,
   reliability, security, fragmentation as well as reordering etc.

     Figure 11: Reference model for centralized construction scenario

   Figure 11 depicts a reference model for centralized construction
   scenario of (AP-ID, AR-Info).  In contrast with Figure1, there is no
   great difference except that a new node called Information Centre
   Entity (ICE) is added.

   The Information Centre is a central repository of (AP-ID, AR-Info)
   tuples, which aggregates (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples from every access
   router and delivers them to the requesting access router.

   For the centralized construction scenario, there are no new
   requirements about construction of AP-ID knowledge and (AP-ID, AR-
   Info) tuples compared with the distributed construction scenario.

   Introduction of Information Centre makes it unnecessary to run a
   dynamic discovering protocol of neighboring network access router
   because access router works together with ICE, instead of with
   neighboring network access routers.

   It is very important and useful to determine the (AP-ID, AR-Info)
   tuples to be exchanged between access router and ICE.  Having
   constructed the (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples, access router has to select
   the suitable tuples to be delivered to ICE.  Access router can
   request (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples from ICE based on AP-IDs; and ICE
   maybe push the suitable (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples to a specific access
   router base on some polices.

   The transportation requirements for centralized construction scenario
   are the same as for distributed construction scenario.

        Figure 12: Reference model for mixed construction scenario

   Figure 12 depicts a reference model for mixed (distributed and
   centralized) construction scenario.  From functional component
   perspective, Figure 12 is the same as Figure 11.  In Figure 12, only
   AR2 has established association with ICE while both AR1 and AR2
   interwork with AR2.

   For the mixed construction scenario in Figure 12, AR1 and AR3 get
   neighboring network information from AR2.  And AR2 exchanges
   information with AR1, AR2 and ICE at the same time.  In this
   scenario, AR2 maybe acts as a proxy for AR1 and AR3 to exchange
   information with ICE.

   There are no special requirements for the mixed construction scenario
   compared with the above mentioned two scenarios.

F.2.  Interactions between MIH services and (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples

   The Information Service of [1] can be used to transport and construct
   (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples of neighboring access network.  [MIH] has
   defined three kinds of information elements for Information Service.
   One kind is Link Layer Information Element, which can be used to
   transport (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples between two access routers as well
   as between access router and Information Centre Entity.

       Figure 13: Using MIH IS in distributed construction scenario

   Figure4 depicts the transportation and construction procedure for
   (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples of neighboring network using Information
   Service.  After two neighboring network access routers discover each
   other, one access router can query the other for specific (AP-ID, AR-
   Info) tuples; and the other can send the response to the querying
   access router.  Besides the query and response messages, MIH
   Information service should support the other type of messages, such
   as "report message" which can be used to transport a bulk of (AP-ID,
   AR-Info) tuples without active query when access routers discover
   each other firstly.

   Figure5 depicts the transportation and construction procedure of (AP-
   ID, AR-Info) tuples in centralized construction scenario.  In this
   figure, after AR1 and AR2 have discovered the ICE supporting MIH
   Information Service, both access routers send the report of own (AP-
   ID, AR-Info) tuples to ICE.  And then, both of them query the (AP-ID,
   AR-Info) tuples of neighboring networks from ICE.  For this scenario,
   ICE is an central repository of (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuples.
