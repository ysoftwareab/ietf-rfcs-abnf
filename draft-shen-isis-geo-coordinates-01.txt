1.  Introduction

   The IS-IS routing protocol defined by [ISO10589] has been widely
   deployed in various networks.  The Geo Coordinates information can be
   useful, particularly within the wide area networks for numerous
   applications.  Similar to the Dynamic Hostname defined in [RFC5301],
   the Geo Coordinates can also be used for network management purposes.

   In the case of BGP speakers setting the outbound "MED" value in route
   advertisement to neighbors, a local policy can be defined to evaluate
   the physical location or physical region of the BGP nexthops.

   In the case of IGP point-to-multiple operations
   [I-D.lamparter-isis-p2mp], [RFC6845], the local system configuration
   can be greatly simplified if the outbound metric to remote neighbors
   can be generated automatically based on this Geo Location of the IGP
   neighbors.

   In the application where IS-IS neighbors are on the same "sub-net"
   but over the WAN network, this Geo Location information may be used
   for equal-cost or unequal-cost load sharing on the local system.
   This enables location based operation on anycast IP prefixes and DMZ
   gateways across the WAN environment.

   For the traffic matrix using the Geo Coordinates within the routing
   domain, instead of a collection of IP nexthops which might be
   translated into locations, this enables automatic region to region
   traffic pattern aggregation.

   This document describes the IS-IS protocol carrying the Geo
   Coordinates information in a new TLV.  This TLV can be distributed

   within the node's LSP or inside the IIH PDU.  The exact mechanism
   each application uses this information is outside the scope of this
   document.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Packet Encoding

   This Geo Coordinates extension introduces one TLV for IS-IS LSP PDU
   and for Hello (IIH) PDU.  The code of the TLV is described in the
   IANA Considerations section of the document.  The fields specify the
   location of the system using WGS-84 (World Geodetic System) reference
   coordinate system [WGS84].  The value of the Geo Coordinates TLV
   consists of the following fields:

       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-....

   Type:    TBD. 8 bits value, to be assigned by IANA.

   Length:  Variable. 8 bits value.  The mandatory part is 16 octets.

   U-bit:   If the U-bit is set, it indicates that the "Location
            Uncertainty" field is specified.  If the U-bit is clear, it
            indicates the "Location Uncertainty" field is unspecified.

   N-bit:   If the N-bit is set, it indicates the Latitude is north
            relative to the Equator.  If the N-bit is clear, it
            indicates the Latitude is south of the Equator.

   E-bit:   If the E-bit is set, it indicates the Longitude is east of
            the Prime Meridian.  If the E-bit is clear, it indicates the
            Longitude is west of the Prime Meridian.

   A-bit:   If the A-bit is set, it indicates the "Altitude" field is
            specified.  If the A-bit is clear, it indicates the
            "Altitude" field is unspecified.

   M-bit:   If the M-bit is set, it indicates the "Altitude" is
            specified in meters.  If the M-bit is clear, it indicates
            the "Altitude" is in centimeters.

   Reserved:  These bits are reserved.  They SHOULD be set to 0 when
            sending protocol packets and MUST be ignored when receiving
            protocol packets.

   Location Uncertainty:  Unsigned 16-bit integer indicating the number
            of centimeters of uncertainty for the location.

   Latitude Degrees:  Unsigned 8-bit integer with a range of 0 - 90
            degrees north or south of the Equator (northern or southern
            hemisphere, respectively).

   Latitude Milliseconds:  Unsigned 24-bit integer with a range of 0 -
            3,599,999 (i.e., less than 60 minutes).

   Longitude Degrees:  Unsigned 8-bit integer with a range of 0 - 180
            degrees east or west of the Prime Meridian.

   Longitude Milliseconds:  Unsigned 24-bit integer with a range of 0 -
            3,599,999 (i.e., less than 60 minutes).

   Altitude:  Signed 32-bit integer containing the Height relative to
            sea level in centimeters or meters.  A negative height
            indicates that the location is below sea level.

   Optional Sub-TLV:  Not defined in this document, for future extension
            related to the Geo Coordinates information.

3.  Operations

   This IS-IS Geo Coordinates TLV can be optionally included in the
   node's LSP, and it is recommended to be in the LSP fragment zero.
   This TLV can also be optionally included in the IIH PDU.  This can be
   useful when the application is setting the outbound p2mp circuit
   metric based on the neighbor's location.  This can also be used in
   the Spine-Leaf extension [I-D.shen-isis-spine-leaf-ext] where there
   is no LSP being flooded into the leaf nodes.

   The Geo location information can be statically provisioned on the
   system, or it can be dynamically acquired from the GPS capable device
   on the system.

4.  IANA Considerations

   A new TLV codepoint is defined in this document and needs to be
   assigned by IANA from the "IS-IS TLV Codepoints" registry.  It is
   referred to as the Geo Coordinates TLV.  This TLV is only to be
   optionally inserted in the LSP PDU and the IIH PDU.  This document
   does not propose any sub-TLV out of this Geo Coordinates TLV.

      Value  Name                   IIH  LSP  SNP  Purge
      -----  ---------------------  ---  ---  ---  -----
      TBD    Geo Coordinates         y    y    n    n

5.  Security Considerations

   Since the Geo Location coordinates provide the exact location of the
   routing devices, disclosure may make the IS-IS devices more
   susceptible to physical attacks.  In situations where this is a
   concern (e.g., in military applications, or the topology of the
   network is considered proprietary information), the implementation
   MUST allow the Geo Location extension to be removed from the IS-IS
   advertisement.

   Security concerns for the base IS-IS are addressed in [ISO10589],
   [RFC5304], [RFC5310], and [RFC7602].

6.  Acknowledgments

   The encoding of the Geo location is adapted from the "Geo Coordinate
   LISP Canonical Address Format" specified in the "LISP Canonical
   Address Format (LCAF)".  We would like to thank the authors of that
   Document and particularly Dino Farinacci for subsequent discussions.

   Thanks to Les Ginsberg, Yi Yang, and Joe Hildebrand for commenting
   and discussions of Geo Coordinates precision encoding.  Thanks to
   David Ward for commenting on attack vector in relation to this new
   capability of IS-IS.
