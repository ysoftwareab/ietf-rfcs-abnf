1. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].

2. Introduction

   SIMPLE defines a set of extensions to the existing protocols (e.g.
   SIP [2]) and some new technologies (e.g. XCAP [3]) in order to
   implement presence and instant messaging (IM) systems. The basic
   SIMPLE architecture relies completely on a peer-to-peer Internet
   model for exchanging both presence and IM data. This open system
   architecture remains an important part of the core SIMPLE
   functionality.

   As SIMPLE has matured and became an important technology for
   implementing presence and IM, different deployment models have been
   contributing to SIMPLE architecture.  The most obvious example is the
   3GPP requirements [4] for wireless mobile access. We expect that with
   growing SIMPLE popularity, more architectural needs will be
   identified.

   At this point of time it is important to identify existing deployment
   architectures and explicitly define a set of requirements for each.
   It will allow achieving both interoperability and efficiency for each
   identified interface.

   Our experience shows that the requirements (and their SIMPLE
   realization) may differ between the interfaces based on the nature of
   the deployments. As a result, it is equally important that the SIMPLE
   realization allows for a straightforward mapping between the
   interfaces concepts and data models.

   This document defines the inter-domain SIMPLE interface and
   identifies the requirements particular to this interface for secure
   and scalable exchange of presence information.

   The IM protocol inter-domain requirements [6] are identified and
   presented in a separate document.

3. Existing Topologies

   Several main types of presence and IM system deployments can be
   identified today:
   o  Enterprise (Single Domains of Trust): A presence and IM system
      that is built for an enterprise use. The enterprise employees are
      usually authenticated using the same credentials that they use for

Internet-Draft    Inter-domain Requirements for SIMPLE          Feb 2004


      other operations within the enterprise. The system is usually
      located within the secured enterprise network.
   o  Federated Systems: Several networks that have created a federation
      between them. In these systems a user is able to inter-operate
      with users in other systems. Usually, there is no need for each
      user of being authenticated since the authentication is achieved
      on system level (i.e. is done at the level of each system).
   o  Public Systems Interconnecting: A public system that enables
      registered users to use the services of the system (such as AOL,
      MSN, and Yahoo). The users in each public system do not belong to
      the same organization and therefore can not be trusted as a whole
      as in enterprise systems.
   o  Open Systems: Users do not belong to an organization and are not
      registered to use the services of a public system. The services
      that the users will use will be freely available on the network
      while peer to peer operations between users will be very common in
      these systems.

4. Inter-domain SIMPLE Interface Definition

   In this document the "inter-domain SIMPLE interface" û is defined as
   the  interface between two presence servers (PS) (per SIMPLE presence
   [5] definitions) that are responsible for all aspects of presence
   information on behalf of their users and under their consent on
   federated or/and open public interconnection links.

   The picture below shows two separately administered networks A and B
   interconnected by Public Internet potentially with a chain of SIP
   proxies for application level routing in-between.  The components
   shown in the picture are only the logical SIMPLE entities that are
   participating in different aspects of presence application. It
   includes Presence Servers (PS-A and PS-B) and PUAs (A1, A2, A3, B1,
   B2, and B3). Examples of administered networks include enterprises,
   public services, etc.

   The exchange of information between the PS servers doesnÆt rely on
   shared database because of existing security regulations and/or
   concerns associated with inter-domain communications.

   The inter-domain presence solution needs to result in both reasonably
   minimized presence information traffic volume and, in the same time,
   being able to address very different security models (from
   multi-branch enterprises with trusted presence servers to public
   deployments with non-trusted foreign presence servers). It is
   important both to be able to address all the hard requirements and in
   the same time to be able to deploy interoperable systems that entail
   only a subset of the identified requirements.

5. PS to PS Logical Connection Requirements
   o  The servers MUST be able to announce or negotiate their
      capabilities.
   o  The servers MUST be able to authenticate each other.
   o  The servers MUST be able to sign (and where possible encrypt) the
      information exchanged between each other (e.g. in the headers).
   o  The servers MUST be able to encrypt payload information exchanged
      between each other.
   o  It MUST be possible to originate the connection by either server.
   o  The connection MUST enable multiplexing of data from multiple
      users and domains.
   o  It MUST be possible to detect PS to PS connection failure (and
      report it to the applications) by both sides in real time.
   o  It SHOULD be possible to allow compression between PS servers.
   o  It MUST be possible to implement periodic refresh of information
      (such as the presence information) between servers independently
      of the periodic refresh of users clients because access/local
      networks differ in their physical characteristics (e.g. bandwidth,
      resilience, packet loss ratio) from backbone/WAN networks.
   o  It SHOULD be possible to support throttling/congestion control
      between PS servers. Examples include negotiation of a maximum
      message rate and resolving the HOL blocking issues with TCP.
   o  It MAY be possible to re-establish a connection without losing
      data (buffering).

   o  Connections between servers MAY be transitive. That is when server
      A is connected to server B and server C is connected to server B;
      it will be possible to send data between server A and server C
      through server B. Note: In order to meet this requirement
      authorization/security model for this case MUST be defined.

6. User-to-User Requirements
   o  Explicit Domain Identifier: It MUST be possible to unambiguously
      determine which domain the user belongs to from the userÆs
      identifier (without requiring complicated lookups).
   o  Meaningful User Identifier: The user name MUST be meaningful to
      the end-users (e.g. not a random global identifier).
   o  A user to all users in other domain: A user in one domain MUST be
      able to allow and disallow its presence visibility to all users in
      a specific other domain.
   o  Per user granularity: A user in one domain MUST be able to allow
      and disallow its presence visibility to a specific user in a
      remote domain.
   o  Asymmetric user relationships: Users in different domains MUST be
      able to allow or disallow their presence visibility to each other
      independently for each direction.
   o  Peer-to-peer authentication in federation scenario: Users MAY be
      able to authenticate each other.
   o  Peer-to-peer authentication in open public interconnection
      scenario:  Users SHOULD be able to authenticate each other.
   o  Peer-to-peer presence info encryption: In open public
      interconnection scenarios it SHOULD be possible to encrypt the
      presence information end-to-end.

7. Information Optimization Model

7.1 New Functionality
   o  Presence access: It MUST be possible to request continuous access
      to the status of a remote presentity without "subscribing" to it.
   o  Presence query: It MUST be possible to retrieve the status of a
      remote presentity in present time only (i.e. without "subscribing"
      to it).
   o  Users search: It MAY be possible to search for a list of
      presence-enabled users by regular expression.

7.2 Batching of REQUESTS for Presence Information Retrieval
   o  Present access: It MUST be possible to perform a request for
      presence access from a single watcher to an arbitrary ad-hoc list
      of presentities in a single operation.
   o  Presence query: It MUST be possible to perform a query request
      from a single watcher to an arbitrary ad-hoc list of presentities
      in a single operation.

Internet-Draft    Inter-domain Requirements for SIMPLE          Feb 2004


   o  Subscription/Unsubscription to presence state: It MUST be possible
      to perform a subscription/unsubscription request from a single
      watcher to an arbitrary ad-hoc list of presentities in a single
      operation.

7.3 Grouping of Watchers for SHARING of Presence Info

   This document introduces an expanded concept of "a group of
   watchers". In the basic form of the concept, a presentity can locally
   arrange its buddies in a number of groups. The watchers in the same
   group get the same level of exposure to the presentityÆs information.
   The presentity can assign a different set and/or level of its
   presence information for each group of watchers.

   In order to minimize the amount of presence traffic on the
   inter-domain link, the real-time presence information is being
   communicated for a pre-defined group of watchers (that are getting
   the same presence information) in addition to or instead of the
   peer-to-peer basic mode.

   In order to accomplish this, PS-B (on behalf of B1) for each B1Æs
   watcher group constructs a sub-group for domain B (as a subset of
   watchers belonging to domain A). Each group can contain zero or more
   B1Æs watchers in domain A.

   The watcher groups are being maintained in domain B and communicated
   to domain A. PS-B notifies PS-A about both the changes in the groupÆs
   membership and the changes in presence state per group.

   PS-B MUST mark the watchers group whether the changes in the presence
   information need to be pushed to PS-A (i.e. there is at least one A
   watcher had "subscribed" to B1Æs presence) or (alternatively) all the
   current watchers in the group had enquired for access rights (and
   momentary info) only.

   PS-A MAY hold the information about the preferred local mode for
   presence information distribution (e.g. push, pull, none) per its
   local watcher in the watchers list.

   The presence information of B1 is distributed by PS-A to the groupÆs
   current members (potentially according to their local preferences in
   either push or pull mode) and is also cached by PS-A in order to
   quickly accommodate newly added group members (without reusing the
   inter-domain link).

7.3.1 A Single Watchers Group per Presentity

   In this simplest case, domain A MAY support "a single watchers group



Levin & Houri            Expires August 1, 2004                 [Page 7]


Internet-Draft    Inter-domain Requirements for SIMPLE          Feb 2004


   per remote presentity". Note, that this allows for most efficient
   inter-domain link usage because each piece of presence information is
   being transmitted only once.

   If the neighboring (to A) domain B supports multiple watchers group
   concept, PS-B MUST NOT allow for watchers from domain A being
   assigned in different groups of presentity B1. The easiest way to
   present this constraint to user B1 would be to restrict all his "A"
   buddies to their own dedicated group.

7.3.2 Trusted vs. Non-trusted Presence Servers

   In a single enterprise deployment with its branches using separate
   presence systems, a presentity of domain B (B1) trusts the presence
   server of domain A (PS-A) to distribute and cache B1Æs presence
   information in open format. In this case no end-to-end keys for
   encrypting the presence information are required.

   In other deployments, presentities of domain B donÆt trust a foreign
   presence server (e.g. of domain A) to have access to their presence
   information in open format. That is especially crucial in combination
   with multiple watchers group approach, where the presence information
   MUST reach the right group of people only. In this type of
   deployments, the Presence information MUST be encrypted end-to-end
   and 1-to-N key distribution mechanisms MUST be applied per a group of
   watchers with more than a single member.

   In order to allow for encrypted 1-to-1 type of connection, both
   servers (on behalf of their users) MUST be able to request 1-to-1
   encrypted mode of operation (resulting in a "single member" group
   establishment).

   It MUST be possible to deploy a combination of open presence
   information approach and a "single member" group with 1-to-1 presence
   encryption mechanism for sensitive presence information, thus
   avoiding the need for using the 1-to-N encryption mechanisms.
