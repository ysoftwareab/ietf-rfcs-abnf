                Integration of Bonding Tunnels and MPTCP
               draft-zuo-banana-mptcp-integration-00.txt

Abstract

   BANdwidth Aggregation for interNet Access (BANANA) based on tunnel
   bonding protocols and Multipath TCP (MPTCP) are two different
   technology suites that offer subscribers with higher bandwidth and
   reliability. MPTCP excels at conducting TCP traffic since its
   flow/congestion control scheme has been well developed while tunnel
   bonding protocols support not only TCP traffic but also UDP traffic.
   The integration of the two kinds of technologies can be considered to
   make use of advantages of both. Moreover, extensions made to the
   tunnel bonding protocols can simplify the MPTCP stack and keep it
   intact. This document specifies the extensions for tunnel bonding
   protocols to realize integrative deployment of tunnel bonding
   solutions and MPTCP.

1. Introduction

   BANdwidth Aggregation for interNet Access (BANANA) offers subscribers
   with higher bandwidth and resilience than they can get from a single
   access. MPTCP proxy based solutions and tunnel based solutions have
   been developed to realize BANANA.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Bonding Tunnels & MPTCP Integration       June 8, 2017


   Multipath TCP (MPTCP) enables a transport connection to operate
   across multiple paths simultaneously [RFC6824]. A flow/congestion
   control scheme has been developed by MPTCP to let subscribers with
   MPTCP endpoints efficiently utilize the bandwidth of the multiple
   paths. Recently, MPTCP WG proposed the network-based MPTCP proxy
   solution [PlainProxy] so that TCP endpoints can utilize the
   aggregated bandwidth between the two MPTCP proxies while they need
   not be upgraded to MPTCP endpoints.

   As enabling technologies of BANANA, tunnel bonding solutions have
   been deployed by multiple Service Providers. In a tunnel bonding
   system, one tunnel is established per-connection between the two
   tunnel bonding boxes. These tunnels are bonded together as if there
   is a single IP link provided between the two boxes for the subscriber
   who buys the tunnel bonding box. Different from MPTCP which is a
   transport layer technology, tunnel bonding protocols operate under
   the transport layer and support both TCP and UDP. 

   MPTCP and a tunnel bonding protocol may coexist in one network. There
   are two types of such coexistence. For the first type, the tunnel
   endpoint and the MPTCP stack can either be collocated in a host, in a
   network device or on a site. For the second type, subscribers'
   endpoints support MPTCP. These MPTCP endpoints are distributing MPTCP
   traffic among the tunnels according to the MPTCP stack. The MPTCP
   traffic should be recognized and avoid being re-distributed by the
   BANANA box's load balancer. This document specifies how a tunnel
   bonding solution and MPTCP can be integrated in a single system in
   order to make use of advantages of both technologies. 

   In this document, message types of the bonding tunnel protocol are
   specified to deliver characteristics of tunnels to the MPTCP stack.
   MPTCP stack uses these tunnels that are setup in advance as its
   network paths. In this way, the time on the discovery of these
   network paths and the time on learning those characteristics can be
   saved. Hence, this kind of integration will help to accelerate the
   deployment of MPTCP.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3. Integration of Tunnel Bonding and MPTCP 

   Tunnel bonding and MPTCP can be integrated as follows. MPTCP stack
   and the tunnel bonding protocol endpoints can collocate in one host,
   one network device or one site. MPTCP stack uses the bonding tunnels
   as its multiple paths so that the time on path discovery can be
   saved. Meanwhile, the bonding tunnels do not need consider the
   flow/congestion control and reliability issues for the TCP traffic.  

   In either ways, the tunnel bonding protocol notifies the MPTCP stack
   about the characteristics of the tunnels, such as the priority, the
   available bandwidth and the Round-Trip Time (RTT). The MPTCP stack
   sorts the paths according to their priorities and allocates subflows
   according to their bandwidth demands and the available bandwidth of
   the tunnels or even RTT.

3.1. Collocated Scenarios

   The following three scenarios explains how a tunnel bonding protocol
   and MPTCP are collocated in one host or one network device.

      Figure 3.1: BANANA endpoints collocate with MPTCP endpoints

   As shown in Figure 3.1, BANANA endpoints HG and HAAP collocate with
   the two MPTCP endpoints respectively. The two endpoints act as tunnel
   endpoints which used to be done by network based devices.

          Figure 3.2: HAAP collocates with one-end MPTCP proxy
                      HG collocates with the MPTCP endpoint

   As shown in Figure 3.2, HAAP acts as the proxy of TCP endpoint2 and
   speaks MPTCP with MPTCP endpoint1. MPTCP proxy2 SHOULD use IPe as the
   source IP address for the TCP session between itself and the TCP
   endpoint2. MPTCP proxy2 locally maintains the mapping between the
   subflows and the normal TCP session.

        Figure 3.3: HG and HAAP collocate with two MPTCP proxies

   As shown in Figure 3.3, HG and HAAP act as MPTCP proxies of TCP
   endpoint1 and TCP endpoint2 respectively. HG and HAAP need to learn
   the source and destination IP address being used by the normal TCP
   session and act as MPTCP proxies of the TCP endpoint1 and TCP
   endpoint2 from each end respectively. 

   The two MPTCP proxies need to exchange the mapping between the TCP
   connection and the MPTCP connection to ensure that a specific TCP
   connection is mapped to the same MPTCP connection on both proxies.
   This mapping is exchanged using the TLV as specified in Section 4.2.

       Figure 3.4: Bonding tunnels discriminate the MPTCP traffic

   Suppose endpoints support the MPTCP stack. The MPTCP traffic (e.g.,
   subflows) will be recognized by the HG/HAAP boxes and locally
   bypassed by the traffic distribution method of the bonding tunnel
   protocol. For this scenario, HG and HAAP need not to deliver the
   tunnel characteristics or connection mapping information of the two
   tunnels to the two MPTCP endpoints. 

3.3. Bypassing and Pre-coloring

   The bypass feature of bonding tunnels allows operators to configure
   traffic types not to be carried through the bonding tunnels. That is
   an "outer" bypass. This memo additionally enables an "inner" (inside
   the bonding tunnels) bypass of MPTCP traffic. 

   Suppose a packet of size B bytes arrives at time t. 

     o If the packet is of the traffic type that is configured to bypass
       the bonding tunnels, it is pre-colored as green; the Single Rate
       Three Color Marker (srTCM) of [RFC2697] MUST operate in the
       Color-Aware mode with a minor change: pre-colored green packet
       will remain in green than be re-colored as yellow; else 

     o if the packet is an MPTCP packet, this packet will be pre-colored
       depends on the load balancer of the MPTCP stack: it is pre-
       colored as green if it is to be delivered through the first
       tunnel or yellow if it is to be delivered through the second
       tunnel; the packet size B is incremented by the size of the
       tunnel header; the srTCM MUST operate in the Color-Aware mode
       with a minor change: pre-colored green packet will remain in
       green than be re-colored as yellow; else 

     o the packet size B is incremented by the size of the tunnel header

INTERNET-DRAFT    Bonding Tunnels & MPTCP Integration       June 8, 2017


       and the srTCM MUST operate in the Color-Blind mode.

   Green packets of the traffic types that are configured to bypass the
   bonding tunnels are carried using the first raw connection of the HG.
   Within the bonding tunnels, green packets are carried using the first
   tunnel while yellow or red packets are carried using the second
   tunnel.  

3.4. The Anycast Mechanism

   When a MPTCP proxy box and a BANANA box are collocated in a site
   rather than one host or one network device (Scenario 2 and Scenario
   3), a box can be put in front of them to achieve anycast. Service
   discovery of BANANA will be handled by the front box while the tunnel
   endpoints will be either the BANANA box or the MPTCP proxy. Hence,
   two pairs of tunnels will be set up. One pair of them are terminated
   by the BANANA box while the other pair of tunnels are terminated by
   the MPTCP proxy box. Hence, MPTCP and non-MPTCP traffic is delivered
   in different tunnels. 

   The two pairs of tunnels share the same pair of paths. Different from
   the scenarios where BANANA box and MPTCP proxy are in the same
   network device, traffic for the MPTCP proxy and the BANANA box is
   distributed onto the paths separately. Bonding tunnels will still
   conduct MPTCP traffic as bypass traffic. BANANA boxes need to measure
   the amount of the bypass traffic periodically in order to subtract
   this amount from the Committed Information Rate (CIR) for the
   coloring mechanism [RFC2697].

4. Message Types

   Two TLVs are defined by the tunnel bonding protocol to facilitate the
   MPTCP stack.

4.1. Tunnel Characteristics

   The follow TLV carries tunnel characteristics and IP addresses of a
   tunnel which will be used as paths by MPTCP stack for its subflows.

      Tunnel Characteristics (TBD), the characteristics of the tunnel.

   Length
      Set to 17 or 41. Source IP address and destination IP address MUST
      be either IPv4 or IPv6.

   Priority
      An unsigned integer. The bonding tunnels will determine the

      notify the Available Downstream Bandwidth and the measured bypass
      traffic rate to the HAAP.

   Available Upstream Bandwidth
      An unsigned integer measured in kbps. There is no bypass traffic
      rate to be substracted from the Committed Upstream Bandwidth. The
      HAAP notify the Available Upstream Bandwidth to the HG.

      destination endpoint IP address of a tunnel between the two MPTCP
      proxies.

4.2. Connection Mapping

   The following Connection Mapping TLV is specified by the tunnel
   bonding protocol for the purpose of exchanging between the pair of
   MPTCP proxies about the mapping between MPTCP connection and TCP
   connection.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Type          |                    (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Length                        |    (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-...-+
   | MPTCP Connection ID                (4 bytes)  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...+-+
   | Source IP address of TCP       (4 or 16 bytes)|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...+-+
   | Destination IP address of TCP  (4 or 16 bytes)|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...+-+

   Type
      Connection Mapping (TBD), the mapping between MPTCP connection and
      TCP connection.

   MPTCP Connection ID
      An unique identifier given to a multipath connection by the MPTCP
      proxy, which is the Token defined in [RFC6824].

   Source IP address of TCP 
      The source IPv4/IPv6 address of the TCP connection.

   Destination IP address of TCP
      The destination IPv4/IPv6 address of the TCP connection.

5. MPTCP Path Selection using Bonding Tunnels

   Based on the tunnel characteristics like bandwidth, latency, etc., of
   the bonding tunnels, MPTCP may select the set of paths for providing
   higher throughput or resilience against path failures.

5.1 Subflow Policy

   As mentioned in [RFC6824], the MPTCP endpoint may use any local
   policy to decide how to send the traffic over the available paths.
   the MPTCP endpoint requires the knowledge of the path 'cost' to make
   effective choices, where the path 'cost' may be obtained from the TLV
   carried by the Tunnel Characteristics TLV. Moreover, in the event
   that the available set of paths changes, the MPTCP endpoint may wish
   to signal a change in priority of subflows to the other MPTCP
   endpoint, where the subflow has the same meaning of physical path.
   Therefore, the priority information may also be obtained from the
   TLV. If the multiple subflows are differentiated from port numbers
   while with the same IP addresses, the priority of subflows are deemed
   to be the same, as obtained from the TLV of the same physical path.

5.2. Address Knowledge Exchange (Path Management)

   As mentioned in [RFC6824], the "path management" is responsible for
   the exchange of additional addresses between the two MPTCP endpoints,
   where the Add Address (ADD_ADDR) MPTCP option is used to inform the
   other MPTCP endpoint of the IP addresses. If the previously informed
   address becomes invalid, a Remove Address (REMOVE_ADDR) option is
   used to announce the peer to remove the subflows related to this
   address. The ADD_ADDR and REMOVE_ADDR options are carried in the
   duplicate ACK packets and to be sent periodically. However, with the
   help of the IP addresses carried in Connection Mapping TLV, the MPTCP
   stack does not need extra signal to manage the paths.   

6. Security Considerations

   TBD.

7. IANA Considerations

   Codepoints of the TLV defined in Section 5 need to be registered by a
   specific tunnel bonding protocol.
