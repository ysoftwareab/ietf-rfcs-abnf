1.  Introduction

   RFC XXX {URI List Conferencing} [2] defines a mechanism for UAC to
   provide a conference server with the initial set of participants to
   address the specific need as follow: 'some environments have tough
   requirements regarding conference establishment time'.  This
   specification respects this consideration and further defines a
   mechanism for UAC to be able to provide the Conference Server with
   the initial conference information and simple policy.

   This specification further provides a mechanism for Conference Server
   to distribute the conference infromation and policy generated from ad
   hoc conference creation request as the history information to
   invitees.

   The mechanism defined in this specification can be used either
   standalone or together with other mechanisms, e.g.  URI-List
   conferencing mechanism defined in RFC XXX {URI List Conferencing} [2]

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3]

   This document uses the conferencing terminology defined in RFC 4353
   [8] "conferencing Framework".

3.  Requirements Analysis

   Some environments have tough requirements regarding conference
   establishment time.  This is true especially when a user wants to
   create a conference in ad hoc manner.  In addition user may only want
   very simple conference information and policy, for example the
   subject and maximum numbers of participants, to be provided for an ad
   hoc conference via only one operation.  In this case they rarely
   desire to manipulate the conference policy before the conference is
   created or during the conference.

   If URI-List conferencing mechanism is used, the Conference Server
   will provide URI-List history to invitees by including a 'recipient-
   list-history' body which contains the manipulated list of invitees.
   The same principal could be applied here.  When Conference Server
   sends INVITE to invitees, e.g. triggered by REFER request or URI-List
   conference creation, the Conference Server can provide the them with
   the conference info and policy as history information.  This will
   help invitees to deterime whether to join this conference which may
   or may not fall into their interest.

   In current art when the invitees get an INVITE request with 'isfocus'
   feature tag he may subscribe to the conference event package as
   defined in RFC 4575 [4] and get notification before joining.
   Consider the fact that the main criteria for invitees to determin
   whether to join a conference may be some simple information, e.g.
   subject, it is more efficient and convenient for invitees to get
   information from the incoming INVITE rather than using subscription
   to the conference event package.  This mechanism could be considered
   as complementary to conference event package subscription mechanism.

   The requirements to support invitation with conference info may be
   summarized as follows:

      REQ 1: The conference mechanism MUST allow the invoker to provide
      the Conference Server with the initial conference information and
      policy in order to create an ad-hoc conference via one operation.

      REQ 2: The conference mechanism MUST allow the Conference Server
      to distribute the conference information and policy to invitees
      contained in the URI-List.

4.  INVITE: Sending conference info to Conference Server

   RFC 4575 [4] defines a conference event package for tightly coupled
   conferences using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events
   framework, along with a data format used in notifications for SIP
   specific conferencing.  RFC XXX {XCON Data Model} [5] extends the
   data format to support more call signaling protocols besides SIP and
   cover the functionality defined in the XCON conferencing framework.
   A sub-set of both data formats can be used to represent conference
   information and policy, e.g. <conference-description> and <maximum-
   user-count>.

   The conference information and policy can be included in the body of
   initial SIP INVITE request to create an ad-hoc conference.  Hence it
   can be included in the follow-up SIP INVITE requests to allow
   invitees to be aware of.

4.1.  Conference Info Format

   The sub set of data format defined in RFC 4575 [4] and extended in
   RFC XXX {XCON Data Model} [5] can be used to represent the conference
   info and policy which could be carried in SIP INVITE method.  The
   amount of data MUST be limited to avoid overload of SIP messages.

4.1.1.  Conference Info Format derived from Conference State Package

   Following is the sub set of data format defined in RFC 4575 [4]
   representing the conference information and policy.

   The 'state' and 'version' attributes SHOULD NOT be used.  Other
   elements defined in RFC 4575 [4] SHOULD NOT be included in initial
   INVITE request and subsequent INVITE requests to invitees.

4.1.2.  Conference Info Format derived from XCON Data Model

   Following is the sub set of data format defined in RFC XXX {XCON Data
   Model} [5] representing the conference information and policy.

   included in initial INVITE request and subsequent INVITE requests to
   invitees.

4.2.  UAC Procedures

   A UAC that wants to include the initial conference information and
   policy in its initial INVITE request MUST add a body whose
   disposition type is 'conference-info' as defined in section xxx of
   this specification.  Additionally, the UAC MUST include the
   'conference-info-invite' option-tag, which is registered with the
   IANA in Section xxx in a Require header field.  The UAC sends this
   INVITE request to the conference factory URI.

   A 200 (OK) response means that the conference was created
   successfully, that the UAC that generated the INVITE request is in
   the conference, and that the server understood the conference
   information.

4.2.1.  re-INVITE Request Generation

   The previous section has specified how to include the conference
   information in an initial INVITE request to a conference server.
   Once the INVITE-initiated dialog between the UAC and the Conference
   Server has been established, the UAC can send re-INVITE requests to
   the conference server to, modify the characteristics of the media
   exchanged with the server.

   There are no semantics associated with conference info bodies in re-
   INVITE requests.  Therefore, UACs SHOULD NOT include conference info
   bodies in re-INVITE requests sent to a conference server.

4.3.  Conference Server Procedures

   Conference Server that is able to receive and process INVITE requests
   with a 'conference-info' body MUST include a 'conference-info-invite'
   option-tag in a Supported header field when responding to OPTIONS
   requests.

   On reception of an INVITE request containing a 'conference-info' body
   as described in Section 3, a conference server MUST follow the rules
   described in RFC 4579 [1] to create ad-hoc conference.

   If <maximum-user-count> element presents, the conference server MUST
   reject the requests to add new participants to the conference when
   the number of participants has reached the number specified in this
   element.

   The Conference Server SHOULD include the same conference info from

Internet-Draft         invite with conference info              May 2007


   incoming INVITE request to the invitees as the history information
   using an INVITE-contained conference info request.  If some values of
   initial conference information are changed, the Conference Server
   SHOULD include history information with updated values in outgoing
   INVITE requests.  The Conference Server SHOULD NOT add new elements
   to history information.

   If the Conference Server includes conference info history in an
   outgoing INVITE request, it MUST include a Content-Disposition header
   field (which is specified in RFC 2183 [6] ) with the value set to
   'conference-info-history' and a 'handling' parameter (as specified in
   RFC 3204 [7] ) set to "optional".

4.3.1.  re-INVITE Request Handling

   There are no semantics associated with conference info bodies in re-
   INVITE requests.  Therefore, a Conference Server receiving a re-
   INVITE request with a conference info body and, consequently, a
   'conference-info-invite' option-tag, following standard SIP
   procedures, rejects it with a 420 (Bad Extension), which carries an
   Unsupported header field listing the 'conference-info-invite' option-
   tag.

      This is because the resource identified by the conference URI does
      not actually support this extension.  On the other hand, the
      resource identified by the conference factory URI does support
      this extension and, consequently, would include the 'conference-
      info-invite' option-tag in, for example, responses to OPTIONS
      requests.

5.  INVITE: Sending URI-List with conference info to Conference Server

   The mechanism defined in section 4 of this specification can be used
   together with other mechanisms, e.g.  URI-List conferencing mechanism
   defined in RFC XXX {URI List Conferencing} [2] .  The initial INVITE
   request can carry a 'multipart/mixed' body composed of three bodies:

   o  'application/sdp' body: describes the session;

   o  'application/resource-lists+xml' body: describes the list of
      target URIs;

   o  'application/conference-info+xml' body: contains the conference
      information.

   The UAC and Conference Server MUST follow the procedures defined in
   RFC XXX {URI List Conferencing} [2] and section 4 of this
   specification respectively.  In addition, the UAC MUST ensure the
   number of URIs in the URI-List will not exceed the number specified
   in <maximum-user-count> element if it presents.  A Conference Server
   receiving a INVITE request with a URI-List body and a conference info
   body while the number of URIs exceed maximum user count,
   consequently, rejects it with a 403 (Forbidden).

6.  Example

6.1.  Creation of Conference with initial Conference Info

   Figure 3 shows an example of ad-hoc conference creation with initial
   conference information and policy.  A UAC sends an INVITE request F1
   that contains SDP body and conference info to the Conference Server.
   The Conference Server answers with a 200 (OK) response.  Then
   Conference Server is requested to add new participant Bob to the
   specified conference using REFER method.  The UAC sends a REFER
   request F3 to the conference URI with a Refer-To containing the URI
   of Bob. The Conference Server sends an INVITE request F7 to Bob
   containing the conference info history.  Then Bob can know the
   information of this specific conference directly when he receives the
   request F7, such as subject, and decides to join it.

6.2.  Creation of a Conference with initial URI-List and Conference Info

   Figure 6 shows an example of ad-hoc conference creation with initial
   URI-List and conference info.  A UAC sends an INVITE request F1 that
   contains initial participants list and conference info to the
   Conference Server.  The Conference Server answers with a 200 (OK)
   response.  Then Conference Server generates an INVITE request to each
   of the participants identifies by the URIs included in the URI-list.
   The Conference Server includes a manipulated URI-list and conference
   info history in each of the outgoing INVITE requests.
