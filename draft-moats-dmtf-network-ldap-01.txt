Abstract

   This draft presents a LDAP schema for the DMTF CIM Network model
   version 2.2 [4].

1. Introduction

   This draft presents a LDAPv3 [1,2] schema for the DMTF CIM Network
   model.  Associations are mapped using a combination of auxiliary
   classes and DIT structure rules.  Where auxiliary classes are used,
   name form and DIT content rules are specified.

   This document is not a product of the DMTF, and represents the view
   of the authors.

2. LDAP Mapping Considerations

2.1 Differences Between this Mapping and the CIM Device Model

   There are some differences between the classes and associations
   specified in the CIM model and the schema here.  First, because the
   core model requires services to be contained by systems the
   NetworkServicesInAdminDomain association doesn't add any new
   information.  Second, there are a couple of classes that don't have
   structural rules specified for them as they don't specify any new
   RDNs.  There are a couple of namespace collisions between this model
   and and other models, a couple of attributes in this model have been
   renamed.  Finaly, the classes TransparentBridgingStatistics,
   SpanningTreeStatistics, SwitchPortStatistics,
   SwitchPortTransparentBridingStatistics,
   SwitchPortSpanningTreeStatistics, SwitchPortSourceRoutingStatisitcs,
   BGPStatistics, and BGPServiceStatistics aren't included as they
   contain counter information that is considered too dynamic for
   directory storage.

2.2 Changes to cimAssociationInstance

   The core mapping [3] defined cimAssociationInstance as a helper
   class.  To support the auxiliary classes, the following classes
   should be added to cimAssociationInstance's content rule:


   Also, the following structure rules defined here need to be added to
   the structure rule for cimAssociationInstance:

3. Class Definitions

   For efficiency in the LDAP representation, associations are specified
   as a combination of auxiliary classes and DIT structure rules.
   Attribute definitions for each class are presented with the object
   class.  Other definitions are also provided when necessary.

   This approach minimizes the number of DN pointers stored in the
   schema, but some pointer dereferencing is necessary.  While not
   explicitly stated in the definitions below, we assume that all
   attributes with DN support the matching rule defined in [3].
   Attribute names for DN pointers also follow the convention that a
   single pointer's name ends in "Ref", while an array of pointers' name
   ends in "Refs".

   Note: all attribute, object class, and name form OIDs are place
   holders, and syntax OIDs in definitions have been replaced by names
   for clarity.

3.1 cim22AdminDomain

   This is a special grouping of cim22ManagedSystemElement objects that
   are all administered by the same user or group of users. It serves as
   an aggregation point to associate one or more of the following
   elements: network devices, such as routers and switches, servers, and
   other resources that can be accessed by end systems. This grouping of
   devices plays an essential role in ensuring that the same
   administrative POLICY is applied to all the devices in the grouping.

3.2 cim22NetworkService

   This base class is derived from the cim22Service class. It serves as
   the root of the network service hierarchy. Network services represent
   generic functions that are available from the network that configure
   and/or change the traffic being sent. For example, FTP is not a
   network service, as it simply passes data unchanged from source to
   destination. On the other hand, services that provide quality of
   service (e.g., DiffServ) and security (e.g., IPSec) do affect the
   traffic stream. Quality of service, IPSec, and other services are
   subclasses of this class. This class hierarchy enables developers to
   match services to users, groups, and other objects in the network.

   This class represents the forwarding of network traffic by receiving
   data from one or more protocol endpoints and sending that data via
   other protocol endpoints. This class is different from the
   cim22RouteCalculationService class in that it represents a way to
   forward traffic independent of calculating routing information (e.g.,
   using static routing). Generally, the endpoints a forwarding service
   routes data among are at the same protocol layer and are usually of
   similar types or of the same type. Examples of this service include

3.4 cim22AutonomousSystem

   This class provides a structured view of routing by segregating the
   system that is using routing (e.g., the Internet, or an extranet)
   into a set of separately administered domains that each have their
   own independent routing policies. These domains are called autonomous
   systems.  The classic definition of an AS, from RFC1771, is

       ...a set of routers under a single technical administration,
      using an interior gateway protocol and common metrics to route
      packets within the AS, and using an exterior gateway protocol to
      route packets to other ASs

   The RFC continues

      Since this classic definition was developed, it has become common
      for a single AS to use several interior gateway protocols and
      sometimes several sets of metrics within an AS. The use of the
      term Autonomous System here stresses that, even when multiple IGPs
      and metrics are used, the administration of an AS appears to other
      ASs to have a single coherent interior routing plan and presents a
      consistent picture of what destinations are reachable through it.

   This class represents the VLAN aspects of the function performed by a
   switch. Some VLAN-aware devices participate in protocols where VLAN
   information is propagated among switches, e.g., GVRP in 802.1Q
   switches and VTP in Cisco Catalyst switches. VLANService also
   represents the function performed by the switch as a participant in
   such a protocol.  VLANService must be subclassed so that instances
   can be distinguished by their class. If there is a name assigned to a
   set of VLAN-aware switches, e.g., the VTP domain name in Cisco
   Catalyst switches, use the Name attribute inherited from cim22Service
   to store the name. A VLANService should be instantiated in a VLAN-
   aware switch even if there is no GVRP-like protocol.
