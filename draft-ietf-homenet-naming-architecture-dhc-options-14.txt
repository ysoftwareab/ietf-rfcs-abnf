            DHCPv6 Options for Home Network Naming Authority
         draft-ietf-homenet-naming-architecture-dhc-options-14

Abstract

   This document defines DHCPv6 options so an agnostic Homenet Naming
   Authority (HNA) can automatically proceed to the appropriate
   configuration and outsource the authoritative naming service for the
   home network.  In most cases, the outsourcing mechanism is
   transparent for the end user.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The reader should be familiar with
   [I-D.ietf-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation].

2.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation] specifies how an
   entity designated as the Homenet Naming Authority (HNA) outsources a
   Public Homenet Zone to an Outsourcing DNS Infrastructure (DOI).

Internet-Draft           DHCPv6 Options for HNA                 May 2021


   This document describes how a network can provision the HNA with a
   specific DOI.  This could be particularly useful for a DOI partly
   managed by an ISP, or to make home networks resilient to HNA
   replacement.  The ISP delegates an IP prefix to the home network as
   well as the associated reverse zone.  The ISP is thus aware of the
   owner of that IP prefix, and as such becomes a natural candidate for
   hosting the Homenet Reverse Zone - that is the Reverse Distribution
   Manager (RDM) and potentially the Reverse Public Authoritative
   Servers.

   In addition, ISPs often identify the line of the home network with a
   name.  Such name is used for their internal network management
   operations and is not a name the home network owner has registered
   to.  ISPs may leverage such infrastructure and provide the homenet
   with a specific domain name designated as per
   [I-D.ietf-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation] a Homenet Registered
   Domain.  Similarly to the reverse zone, ISPs are aware of who owns
   that domain name and may become a natural candidate for hosting the
   Homenet Zone - that is the Distribution Manager (DM) and the Public
   Authoritative Servers.

   This document describes DHCPv6 options that enable an ISP to provide
   the necessary parameters to the HNA, to proceed.  More specifically,
   the ISP provides the Registered Homenet Domain, necessary information
   on the DM and the RDM so the HNA can manage and upload the Public
   Homenet Zone and the Reverse Public Homenet Zone as described in
   [I-D.ietf-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation].

   The use of DHCPv6 options may make the configuration completely
   transparent to the end user and provides a similar level of trust as
   the one used to provide the IP prefix - when provisioned via DHCP.

3.  Procedure Overview

   This section illustrates how a HNA receives the necessary information
   via DHCPv6 options to outsource its authoritative naming service to
   the DOI.  For the sake of simplicity, and similarly to
   [I-D.ietf-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation], this section assumes
   that the HNA and the home network DHCPv6 client are collocated on the
   Customer Edge (CE) router [RFC7368].  Note also that this is not
   mandatory and the DHCPv6 client may instruct remotely the HNA and the
   DHCPv6 either with a proprietary protocol or a protocol that will be
   defined in the future.  In addition, this section assumes the
   responsible entity for the DHCPv6 server is configured with the DM
   and RDM.  This means a Registered Homenet Domain can be associated to
   the DHCPv6 client.

Internet-Draft           DHCPv6 Options for HNA                 May 2021


   This scenario is believed to be the most popular scenario.  This
   document does not ignore scenarios where the DHCPv6 server does not
   have privileged relations with the DM or RDM.  These cases are
   discussed in Appendix A.  Such scenarios do not necessarily require
   configuration for the end user and can also be zero-config.

   The scenario considered in this section is as follows:

   1.  The HNA is willing to outsource the Public Homenet Zone or
       Homenet Reverse Zone.  The DHCPv6 client is configured to include
       in its Option Request Option (ORO) the Registered Homenet Domain
       Option (OPTION_REGISTERED_DOMAIN), the Distribution Manager
       Option (OPTION_DIST_MANAGER) and the Reverse Distribution Manager
       Option (OPTION_REVERSE_DIST_MANAGER) option codes.

   2.  The DHCPv6 server responds to the HNA with the requested DHCPv6
       options based on the identified homenet.  The DHCPv6 client
       passes the information to the HNA.

   3.  The HNA is authenticated (eventually by a self signed
       certificate) by the DM and the RDM.  The HNA builds the Homenet
       Zone (or the Homenet Reverse Zone) and proceed as described in
       [I-D.ietf-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation].  The DHCPv6
       options provide the necessary non optional parameters described
       in Section 14 of [I-D.ietf-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation].
       The HNA may complement the configurations with additional
       parameters via means not yet defined.  Section 14 of
       [I-D.ietf-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation] describes such
       parameters that MAY take some specific non default value.

4.  DHCPv6 Option

   This section details the payload of the DHCPv6 options.

4.1.  Registered Homenet Domain Option

   The Registered Domain Option (OPTION_REGISTERED_DOMAIN) indicates the
   FQDN associated to the home network.

      code for the Reverse Distribution Manager Option (TBD3).

   o  option-len (16 bits): length in octets of the option-data field as
      described in [RFC8415].

   o  Supported Transport (16 bits): defines the supported transport by

   o  Reverse Distribution Manager FQDN (variable): the FQDN of the RDM
      encoded as described in section 10 of [RFC8415].

5.  DHCPv6 Behavior

5.1.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   Sections 17.2.2 and 18.2 of [RFC8415] govern server operation in
   regards to option assignment.  As a convenience to the reader, we
   mention here that the server will send option foo only if configured
   with specific values for foo and if the client requested it.  In
   particular, when configured the DHCPv6 server sends the Registered
   Homenet Domain Option, Distribution Manager Option, the Reverse
   Distribution Manager Option when requested by the DHCPv6 client by
   including necessary option codes in its ORO.

5.2.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   The DHCPv6 client includes Registered Homenet Domain Option,
   Distribution Manager Option, the Reverse Distribution Manager Option
   in an ORO as specified in Sections 18.2.1, 18.2.2, 18.2.4, 18.2.5,
   18.2.6, and 21.7 of [RFC8415].

   Upon receiving a DHCPv6 option described in this document in the
   Reply message, the HNA SHOULD proceed as described in
   [I-D.ietf-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation].

5.3.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behavior

   There are no additional requirements for the DHCPv6 Relay agents.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign the following new DHCPv6 Option Codes in
   the registry maintained in: https://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-
   parameters/dhcpv6-parameters.xhtml#dhcpv6-parameters-2.

   Value Description                   Client ORO     Singleton Option
   TBD1  OPTION_REGISTERED_DOMAIN       Yes            No
   TBD2  OPTION_DIST_MANAGER            Yes            Yes
   TBD3  OPTION_REVERSE_DIST_MANAGER    Yes            Yes

   IANA is requested to maintain a new number space of Supported
   Transport parameter in the Distributed Manager Option
   (OPTION_DIST_MANAGER) or the Reverse Distribution Manager Option
   (OPTION_REVERSE_DIST_MANAGER).  The different parameters are defined
   in Figure 3 in Section 4.2.1.  Future code points are assigned under
   Specification Required as per [RFC8126].

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC8415] are to be considered.  The
   use of DHCPv6 options provides a similar level of trust as the one
   used to provide the IP prefix.  The link between the HNA and the
   DHCPv6 server may benefit from additional security for example by
   using [I-D.ietf-dhc-sedhcpv6].

8.  Acknowledgments

   We would like to thank Marcin Siodelski, Bernie Volz and Ted Lemon
   for their comments on the design of the DHCPv6 options.  We would
   also like to thank Mark Andrews, Andrew Sullivan and Lorenzo Colliti
   for their remarks on the architecture design.  The designed solution
   has been largely been inspired by Mark Andrews's document
   [I-D.andrews-dnsop-pd-reverse] as well as discussions with Mark.  We
   also thank Ray Hunter for its reviews, its comments and for
   suggesting an appropriated terminology.

Appendix A.  Scenarios and impact on the End User

   This section details various scenarios and discuss their impact on
   the end user.  This section is not normative and limits the
   description of a limited scope of scenarios that are assumed to be
   representative.  Many other scenarios may be derived from these.

Appendix B.  Base Scenario

   The base scenario is the one described in Section 3 in which an ISP
   manages the DHCPv6 server, the DM and RDM.

   The end user subscribes to the ISP (foo), and at subscription time
   registers for example.foo as its Registered Homenet Domain
   example.foo.

   In this scenario, the DHCPv6 server, DM and RDM are managed by the
   ISP so the DHCPv6 server and as such can provide authentication
   credentials of the HNA to enable secure authenticated transaction
   with the DM and the Reverse DM.

   The main advantage of this scenario is that the naming architecture
   is configured automatically and transparently for the end user.  The
   drawbacks are that the end user uses a Registered Homenet Domain
   managed by the ISP and that it relies on the ISP naming
   infrastructure.

B.1.  Third Party Registered Homenet Domain

   This section considers the case when the end user wants its home
   network to use example.com not managed by her ISP (foo) as a
   Registered Homenet Domain.  This section still consider the ISP
   manages the home network and still provides example.foo as a
   Registered Homenet Domain.

   When the end user buys the domain name example.com, it may request to
   redirect the name example.com to example.foo using static redirection
   with CNAME [RFC2181], [RFC1034], DNAME [RFC6672] or CNAME+DNAME
   [I-D.sury-dnsext-cname-dname].

   This configuration is performed once when the domain name example.com
   is registered.  The only information the end user needs to know is
   the domain name assigned by the ISP.  Once this configuration is done
   no additional configuration is needed anymore.  More specifically,
   the HNA may be changed, the zone can be updated as in Appendix B
   without any additional configuration from the end user.

   The main advantage of this scenario is that the end user benefits
   from the Zero Configuration of the Base Scenario Appendix B.  Then,
   the end user is able to register for its home network an unlimited
   number of domain names provided by an unlimited number of different
   third party providers.  The drawback of this scenario may be that the
   end user still rely on the ISP naming infrastructure.  Note that the
   only case this may be inconvenient is when the DNS servers provided
   by the ISPs results in high latency.

B.2.  Third Party DNS Infrastructure

   This scenario considers that the end user uses example.com as a
   Registered Homenet Domain, and does not want to rely on the
   authoritative servers provided by the ISP.

   In this section we limit the outsourcing to the DM and Public
   Authoritative Server(s) to a third party.  The Reverse Public
   Authoritative Server(s) and the RDM remain managed by the ISP as the
   IP prefix is managed by the ISP.

   Outsourcing to a third party DM can be performed in the following
   ways:

   1.  Updating the DHCPv6 server Information.  One can imagine a GUI
       interface that enables the end user to modify its profile
       parameters.  Again, this configuration update is done once-for-
       ever.

   2.  Upload the configuration of the DM to the HNA.  In some cases,
       the provider of the CE router hosting the HNA may be the
       registrar and provide the CE router already configured.  In other
       cases, the CE router may request the end user to log into the
       registrar to validate the ownership of the Registered Homenet
       Domain and agree on the necessary credentials to secure the
       communication between the HNA and the DM.  As described in
       [I-D.ietf-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation], such settings
       could be performed in an almost automatic way as to limit the
       necessary interactions with the end user.

B.3.  Multiple ISPs

   This scenario considers a HNA connected to multiple ISPs.

   Suppose the HNA has been configured each of its interfaces
   independently with each ISPS as described in Appendix B.  Each ISP
   provides a different Registered Homenet Domain.

Internet-Draft           DHCPv6 Options for HNA                 May 2021


   The protocol and DHCPv6 options described in this document are fully
   compatible with a HNA connected to multiple ISPs with multiple
   Registered Homenet Domains.  However, the HNA should be able to
   handle different Registered Homenet Domains.  This is an
   implementation issue which is outside the scope of the current
   document.

   If a HNA is not able to handle multiple Registered Homenet Domains,
   the HNA may remain connected to multiple ISP with a single Registered
   Homenet Domain.  In this case, one entity is chosen to host the
   Registered Homenet Domain.  This entity may be one of the ISP or a
   third party.  Note that having multiple ISPs can be motivated for
   bandwidth aggregation, or connectivity fail-over.  In the case of
   connectivity fail-over, the fail-over concerns the access network and
   a failure of the access network may not impact the core network where
   the DM and Public Authoritative Primaries are hosted.  In that sense,
   choosing one of the ISP even in a scenario of multiple ISPs may make
   sense.  However, for sake of simplicity, this scenario assumes that a
   third party has been chosen to host the Registered Homenet Domain.
   Configuration is performed as described in Appendix B.1 and
   Appendix B.2.

   With the configuration described in Appendix B.1, the HNA is expect
   to be able to handle multiple Homenet Registered Domain, as the third
   party redirect to one of the ISPs servers.  With the configuration
   described in Appendix B.2, DNS zone are hosted and maintained by the
   third party.  A single DNS(SEC) Homenet Zone is built and maintained
   by the HNA.  This latter configuration is likely to match most HNA
   implementations.

   The protocol and DHCPv6 options described in this document are fully
   compatible with a HNA connected to multiple ISPs.  To configure or
   not and how to configure the HNA depends on the HNA facilities.
   Appendix B and Appendix B.1 require the HNA to handle multiple
   Registered Homenet Domain, whereas Appendix B.2 does not have such
   requirement.
