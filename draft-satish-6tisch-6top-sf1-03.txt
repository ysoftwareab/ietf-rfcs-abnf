                    draft-satish-6tisch-6top-sf1-03

Abstract

   This document defines a 6top Scheduling Function called "Scheduling
   Function One" (SF1) to reserve, label and schedule the end-to-end
   resources hop-by-hop through the Distributed Resource Reservation
   Protocol(RSVP).  SF1 uses the 6P signaling messages with a global
   TrackID to add or delete the cells in L2-bundles of isolated traffic
   flows.

1.  Introduction

   Scheduling Function Zero (SF0) [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-sf0] enables on-
   the-fly cell scheduling (ADD/DELETE) between 1-hop neighbors for
   aggregated (best-effort) traffic flows.  In other words, all the
   instances from nodeA to nodeB in Figure 1 are scheduled in a single
   L3-bundle (IP link).

                  L3-bundle (Instance-1,Instance-2,...Instance-n)
               ------------------------------------------------->
         nodeA<-------------------------------------------------  nodeB
                  L3-bundle (Instance-1,Instance-2,...Instance-n)

   Figure 1: L3-bundle for aggregated traffic flows over 1-hop with SF0.

   Some applications (e.g.  Industrial M2M) require end-to-end dedicated
   L2-bundles to support control/data streams for time-critical
   applications [I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases].  For such applications,
   per-instance L2-bundles need to be scheduled hop-by-hop in between
   sender and receiver [I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture].  In addition,
   cells in the scheduled end-to-end L2-bundles of each instance may

   have to be dynamically adapted for bursty time-critical traffic
   flows.  To achieve this, an end-to-end track has to be installed with
   a global TrackID for each isolated instance.  With 1-hop based SF0
   cell scheduling, it is difficult to schedule dedicated end-to-end
   cells for isolated traffic flows.  Moreover, global bandwidth
   estimation through Resource Reservation protocol is required for
   bandwidth allocation in multi-hop cell scheduling.  This draft
   specifies a Scheduling Function One (SF1) to schedule end-to-end
   dedicated L2-bundles for each instance, and to dynamically adapt the
   cells in already scheduled L2-bundles through the RSVP protocol (see
   Figure 2).

2.  Operation of Scheduling Function One (SF1)

   With SF1, the Sender determines when to reserve end-to-end resources,
   support implicit label switching (GMPLS), schedule the labeled
   L2-bundles hop-by-hop, associate the global TrackID for labeled
   L2-bundles, and dynamically adapt the cells in an existing instance
   through RSVP(Resource Reservation Protocol).  The following events
   may trigger the use of SF1:

   1.  If Sender has a outgoing bandwidth requirement for a new instance
       to transmit data to Receiver.

   2.  If Sender has a new outgoing bandwidth requirement for an
       existing instance to transmit data to Receiver.

   In both cases, distributed RSVP(explained in Section 2.1) is
   triggered to provide end-to-end resource reservations along with
   scheduling operations.

2.1.  Resource Reservation Protocol(RSVP)

   In this specification, an end-to-end route path is assumed to be
   available, for instance by using reactive P2P-RPL (Storing or non-
   storing mode) routing.  GMPLS signaling Resource Reservation Protocol
   (RSVP) with 6tisch scheduling capability is designed to label,
   reserve and schedule the resources hop-by-hop for isolated traffic
   flows.  SF1 of the application sender will trigger the RSVP
   operation, whenever it has time critical traffic.  RSVP has two
   messages, namely (1)RSVP-PATH message (Sender to Receiver) and (2)
   RSVP-RESV message (Receiver to Sender).

2.2.  RSVP-PATH message

   The basic RSVP-PATH message [RFC2205] is used to carry the "Sender
   Traffic Specification" along with "characterization parameters" from
   sender to receiver.  Since RSVP treat objects as opaque data, it is
   permissible to use another protocol element (e.g.,GMPLS, 6P, SF1) as
   an object in a RSVP-PATH message.

   The format of the PATH message that supports 6tisch scheduling
   capabilities (6P and SF1) is as follows:

   <Path Message> ::=    <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ]
                         [ [<MESSAGE_ID_ACK> | <MESSAGE_ID_NACK> ] ... ]
                         [ <MESSAGE_ID> ]
                         <SESSION> <RSVP_HOP>
                         <TIME_VALUES>
                         [ <EXPLICIT_ROUTE> ]
                         <LABEL_REQUEST>
                         [ <SF1 OPERATION REQUEST> ]
                         [ <6P OPERATION REQUEST> ]
                         [ <SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> ]
                         [ <NOTIFY_REQUEST> ]
                         [ <ADMIN_STATUS> ]
                         [ <POLICY_DATA> ... ]
                         <sender descriptor>

     <sender descriptor> ::=  <SENDER_TEMPLATE> <SENDER_TSPEC>
                              [ <ADSPEC> ]
                              [ <RECORD_ROUTE> ]

   The format of the Generalized Label Request Object in PATH message
   is:

   The Generalized Label Request describes the requirement of
   communication characteristics to support the 6TiSCH-LSP being
   requested.  Generalized Label Request object is set by the ingress
   node (6LR), transparently passed by transit nodes, and used by the
   egress node(6LR).

   1.  LSP Encoding Type (8 bits): Indicates the encoding of the LSP
       being requested.

        -----         ----
         TBD        Timeslot

   2.  Switching Type (8 bits):Indicates the type of switching that
       should be performed on a particular link.

        Value               Type
        -----               ----
         100    Time-Division-Multiplex Capable (TDM)

   3.  G-PID (8 bits): An identifier of the payload carried by an LSP,
       i.e., an identifier of the client layer of that LSP.

        Value             Type                     Technology

         TBD     Wireless Ethernet(802.15.4)         6TiSCH

   "SF1 OPERATION REQUEST" and "6P OPERATION REQUEST" are added in the
   PATH message to check for 6tisch scheduling capabilities within the
   intermediate nodes from sender to receiver.  The "Timeslot Switching
   Capability" (TSC) is used as an implicit label to switch the cell at
   intermediate nodes [RFC3473].  "LABEL_REQUEST" in path message should
   be set to "Timeslot Switching Capability".  The "RPLInstanceID" is
   added in the "SENDER_TEMPLATE" to create the Global TrackID during 6P
   transactions of RSVP-RESV messages.  If an intermediate node does not
   support the TSC or "6P transactions" or "SF1 operation" then it MUST
   send a "PathErr" message back to application.

2.3.  RSVP-RESV message

   The basic RSVP-RESV messages [RFC2205] are transmitted upstream from
   receiver to sender to provide resource reservation as well as "Label
   Distribution".  In this specification, hop-by-hop scheduling is
   extended to support both resource reservation and label distribution.
   The current specification is only defined for unicast point-to-point
   traffic flows, i.e., Fixed Filter (FF) reservation style.

   The format of the RESV message that supports 6tisch scheduling
   capabilities (6P and SF1) is as follows:

<Resv Message> ::= <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ]
                         [ [<MESSAGE_ID_ACK> | <MESSAGE_ID_NACK> ] ... ]
                         [ <MESSAGE_ID> ]
                         <SESSION> <RSVP_HOP>
                         <TIME_VALUES>
                         <LABEL>
                         [ <SF1 OPERATION> ]
                         [ <6P OPERATION> ]
                         [ <RESV_CONFIRM> ]  [ <SCOPE> ]
                         [ <NOTIFY_REQUEST> ]
                         [ <ADMIN_STATUS> ]
                         [ <POLICY_DATA> ... ]
                         <STYLE> <flow descriptor list>

     <flow descriptor list> ::= <FF flow descriptor>
     <FF flow descriptor> ::= [ <FLOWSPEC> ] <FILTER_SPEC> <LABEL>
     [ <RECORD_ROUTE> ]

   The format of the Generalized Label Object in RESV message is:

     0                   1                   2                   3

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   1.  Slotframe ID (1 octet): It represents the specific slotframe of
   the SlotOffset.  A slotframe is defined as the collection of
   timeslots repeating in time.  It is characterized by a slotframe_ID,
   and a slotframe_size.

Internet-Draft        draft-satish-6tisch-6top-sf1         February 2017


   2. slotOffset(3 octets): It identifies a column in the TSCH schedule.
   SlotOffset is used as an implicit lable to switch the packet through
   "Track Forwarding".

   Upon arrival of the PATH message at an application receiver, the
   SENDER_TSPEC and ADSPEC objects are interpreted to select the
   resource reservation parameters.  Since RSVP provides receiver
   initiated resource reservation setup, the scheduling operation has to
   proceed upstream from receiver to sender.  Subsequently, the reserved
   resources (bandwidth) are mapped into 6tisch cells through Scheduling
   Function and a corresponding L2-bundle is created.  An aggregation of
   cells is called a "bundle" (the directional link to a next-hop
   neighbor).  Every L2-bundle is associated with a global trackID to
   dynamically adapt the cells "hop-by-hop" to an scheduled instance.
   In addition, the TrackID is used as a "packet filter" to switch the
   incoming tracks to outgoing tracks.  The receiver will generate the
   TrackID with the combination of "Source/Destination IP address" and
   "RPLInstanceID" that is obtained from "SENDER_TEMPLATE/FILTER_SPEC".

      Figure 3: Operation of RSVP-RESV message with 6P transactions.

   From [RFC6997], the application node that initiates the point-to-
   point (P2P) traffic is called the "Parent node" and the application
   receiver that receives the data is called the "Child node".  Since
   the child node targets the Scheduling operation upstream towards the
   sender, the "3-step transaction" of the 6P protocol needs to be
   triggered at each hop to schedule the reserved resources (see
   Figure 3).  Hence, "6P Request" with an associated TrackID in the
   metadata field is transmitted in "RESV" message from Receiver to the

   next-hop node.  The "NumCells" field in the 6P Request is set to the
   required number of cells, and "CellList" should be empty.  Once the
   next-hop node receives the "RESV" message, it checks the service
   request specification(Rspec) and performs the resource reservation.
   Subsequently, the Scheduling Function of next-hop neighbor maps the
   reserved resources into transmit cells.  Later, "6P Response" with
   "CellList" (slotOffset, channelOffset) is transmitted downstream to
   receiver.  When the receiver has cells (to receive data) available
   with the "CellList" in the "6P Response" then "6P Confirmation" with
   "IANA_6TOP_RC_SUCCESS" is upstream towards next-hop node.  Otherwise,
   "ResvErr" message SHOULD be sent back to the receiver with the
   specific error.  Since the cell information
   (slotOffset,channelOffset) is available in the 6P transactions, the
   next-hop node will store the "SlotOffset(Timeslot)" as a label to
   switch the traffic flow to receiver.  For multiple cells (i.e., a
   bundle), a generalized label set is created where each label
   represents one cell to forward data to receiver.  Once the 6P
   transaction is successful between a next-hop node and receiver, a
   labeled L2-bundle is created with the associated TrackID.
   Subsequently, "cell label set" is stored in the Resv state block at
   the next-hop node.  Later, SF1 of "next-hop node" maps the reserved
   bandwidth to the "receiving cells" to receive the data from its
   upstream node.  The "RESV" message with "6P Request" along with
   TrackID is transmitted upstream towards sender node.  In this way, an
   end-to-end Track is installed with a succession of paired L2-bundles
   (a receive bundle from the previous hop and a transmit bundle to the
   next hop) for a specific instance from sender to receiver (See
   Figure 4).

         Figure 4: End-to-end cell scheduling with SF1 Scheduling

   During data transmission, SF1 of sender at 6top identifies the
   TrackID based on "Sender/Receiver IP address, RPLInstanceID" from the
   received packet.  Subsequently, an associated L2-bundle is scheduled
   to forward the data to the next-hop neighbor (nodeB in Figure 4).

   Later, SF1 of the next-hop neighbor identifies the TrackID based on
   the "Sender/Receiver IP address, RPLInstanceID" of the received data
   to switch the track towards receiver.  In this way, end-to-end data
   transmission is achieved through "Track forwarding" at the 6top sub-
   layer (see Figure 4).  Using TSC of RSVP-GMPLS [RFC3473], cells in
   paired L2-bundles are used as implicit labels to switch the data from
   Sender to Receiver at the 6top sub-layer.

2.4.  Reroute and Bandwidth Increase mechanism

   Whenever the sender needs to establish a new tunnel that can maintain
   resource reservations without double counting (at any particular
   intermediate node) the resources with an existing tunnel, then the
   "RSVP reroute mechanism" is initiated [RFC3209].  With this
   operation, bandwidth can be increased or decreased end-to-end in the
   tunnel.  The detailed explanation of the reroute mechanism is
   explained in [RFC3209].

2.5.  Error Codes

   The detailed explanation of PathErr and ResvErr with different
   ERROR_SPEC to handle Scheduling and 6P operation errors will be
   described in later specification.

3.  Scheduling Function Identifier

   The Scheduling Function Identifier (SFID) of SF1 is
   IANA_SFID_SF1(TBD).

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new Scheduling Function
   (IANA_SFID_SF1) from the SF space of Scheduling Functions defined in
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-sf0]
