1.  Introduction

   In 2004-2005, work was initiated on a Modular Cable Modem Termination
   System (M-CMTS) architecture at CableLabs.  A number of
   specifications were published including the Edge Resource Manager
   Interface Specification [ERMI].

   A block diagram of the architecture relevant to the ERMI
   specification and its use of the RTSP protocol is shown on Figure 1.
   DOCSIS stands for Data-Over-Cable-Service-Interface Specifications.
   The cable head-end architecture centers on DOCSIS CMTS systems that
   send Video and Internet data to subscribers.
   An Edge QAM (EQAM) is a head-end or hub device that receives packets
   of digital video or data from the operator network.  It re-packetizes
   the video or data into an MPEG transport stream and digitally
   modulates the transport stream onto a downstream RF carrier using
   Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM).
   A CMTS requires resources (such as EQAMs) to relay this data to
   subscriber modems.  These resources are allocated by an Edge Resource
   Manager (ERM).

   The CMTS and EQAMs use the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP,
   [RFC2326]), as defined in section 5.2.3. of the CableLabs Edge
   Resource Manager Interface Specification ([ERMI]) during the resource
   allocation process.  The CMTS asks the Edge Resource Manager for an
   EQAM, the ERM confers with the EQAMs, and then gives the CMTS the
   appropriate EQAM resource.

        RTSP Usage in Edge Resource Manager Interface Specification

                                 Figure 1

   The M-CMTS core, the ERM, and the EQAM use TCP as the transport-layer
   protocol and listen on TCP port 554 for incoming RTSP connections.
   The M-CMTS core acts as an RTSP client.  The ERM plays the role of an
   RTSP client and an RTSP server.  The EQAM acts as an RTSP server.
   The RTSP SETUP, TEARDOWN, PING and GET PARAMETER methods must at a
   minimum be supported by M-CMTS, ERM and EQAM.  In addition, the
   M-CMTS core and the ERM must also support the ANNOUNCE method.
   A session keepalive method named PING has been added as part of the
   ERMI specification.  The authors note that the OPTIONS method could
   have been used to act as a PING mechanism as it is the case with some
   SIP implementations.

                  PING rtsp://172.22.10.3 RTSP/1.0
                  CSeq: 123
                  Session: 1234567
                  Require: ermi

        A corresponding response from the RTSP server to the client:
                  RTSP/1.0 200 OK
                  CSeq: 123
                  Session: 1234567


   The ERMI specification makes extensions to RTSP [RFC2326] to add
   EQAM-specific parameters; the applicability of ERMI messages is
   within the internal system architecture of a DOCSIS M-CMTS system and
   within a DOCSIS cable network.  These extensions are briefly
   discussed Section 2.1.

2.  ERMI extensions to RTSP

2.1.  List of ERMI extensions

   Section 7.1.5 "RTSP Extensions" of the [ERMI] specification outlines
   the relevant extensions.  These extensions are briefly summarized
   here; the specification should be examined directly for more details.

   The following extensions to RTSP have been used in ERMI:

   o    New parameters for the Transport header:
        Section 12.39 of [RFC2326] specifies the Transport header.  ERMI
        Extensions to the Transport header identify parameters
        associated with the transport of the media stream through an
        EQAM.
        Transport headers take the form of:
        Transport: <channel> [, <channel>].
        Each <channel> field takes the form: DOCSIS/QAM; unicast.  The
        bit rate, QAM ID and DEPI mode are passed as part of the
        transport header with additional optional values.

   o    New DOCSIS-Notice header:
        The DOCSIS-Notice header header provides information sent from
        an RTSP server to a client in an ANNOUNCE request, specifically
        to reclaim an ERMI session.
        The syntax of the DOCSIS-Notice header is:
        DOCSIS-Notice: <notice-code>
        The RTSP client and server must support the values of notice-
        code and code-description defined in the ERMI specification.
        Currently, only the value of '5701' is define to reclaim a
        session.

   o    New RTSP option tag in the Require header:
        The Require: header must be present in RTSP requests methods,
        with the newly defined 'ermi' tag (see IANA consideration
        section).

   o    New parameters for GET_PARAMETER method:
        The RTSP GET_PARAMETER method is used by the client to obtain
        the list of active RTSP sessions that were initiated by the
        client before the current TCP connection was established.  It is
        used by a client as a mechanism to synchronize its session state
        with the RTSP server following a client reboot.

2.2.  Limited Applicability of RTSP ERMI extensions

   There are several considerations to the ERMI RTSP extensions.

   First, the ERMI specification is intended to be used within a single
   cable administrative domain, a 'closed' cable system head-end with
   controlled network and administrative domains.  It is unlikely that
   the [ERMI] protocols will escape these domains as the ERMI traffic is
   considered as a service control and management.

   Secondly, the ERMI specification requires that RTSP requests include
   the Require Header with the 'ermi' option tag.  Section 12.32 of
   [RFC2326] requires a non-ERMI server to reject this ERMI option tag
   header as Unsupported.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document also reuses the terminology defined in [ERMI] and it is
   recommended for the reader to read the ERMI specification.

Internet-Draft         mmusic-rtsp-ermi-extensions         February 2008


4.  IANA Considerations

   The CableLabs ERMI specification currently makes use of a new option
   tag indicating support for the ERMI RTSP requirements; this option
   tag means that the various extensions (PING Method, Transport header,
   etc.) are supported.

   Depending on the feedback from the IETF MMUSIC working group, this
   section should properly register the extensions that are deemed
   necessary.

   For example, a new option tag should be defined as described in
   section 3.8.1 of [RFC2326]:

   o    Name and description of option:
        The name of this new option is 'ermi' (or may be
        com.cablelabs.ermi).  This text should explicitly define what is
        required to be supposed to claim compliance with this new option
        tag.

   o    Change of control: CableLabs?

   o    Reference: [ERMI]
