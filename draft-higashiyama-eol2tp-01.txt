1. Introduction

   L2TP [RFC2661] defines the procedures for tunneling PPP [RFC1661]
   sessions between a so-called L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) and a
   L2TP Network Server (LNS).

   BCP [RFC2878] defines the procedures for carrying Ethernet Frames on
   PPP connections.

   The combination of the two standards allows users to make a remote
   connection from a host to a LAN or from a LAN to a LAN transparently.
   This technology is used to tunnel Ethernet and IEEE 802.3 media
   access control (MAC) frames (including [IEEE 802.1Q] VLAN datagrams)
   with L2TP. In this document, we define this technology as Ethernet
   over L2TP or EoL2TP.

   The issues, requirements, architecture and network model of EoL2TP
   are different from those of L2TP. This document intends to provide a
   framework for EoL2TP and documents its issues, requirements,
   architecture and network model.

2. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. Motivation

   In an intranet, many kind of protocols are used such as DECNET, XNS,
   AppleTalk, and Banyan. Some of these may be non-routed protocols, or
   they may be protocols that users do not want to route for some
   reason.  In this situation, they want to bridge these protocols. If
   the users's sites are in two different locations, the technology for
   tunneling Ethernet frames is applied to connect two or more remote
   sites.  Tunneling Ethernet frames MAY provide one kind of Virtual
   Private Network.  But this motivation, usage, requirement,
   architecture and network model are different from traditional VPNs.

   Users often want to use Virtual LANs as defined in [IEEE 802.1Q]
   because VLANs are widely used today and useful to multiplex traffic
   from different LANs on one connection.

   For this purpose, many tunneling technologies are described in IETF
   documents, including "BCP: Bridge Control Protocol over PPP"
   [RFC2878] and "Ethernet over ATM" [RFC1483].  Several others have
   been proposed in IETF working groups.

   Tunneling Ethernet frames over L2TP is usefull because L2TP is well-
   designed to Tunneling multi-protocols over Internet or ATM network.

4. EoL2TP framework

4.1 What is EoL2TP?

   EoL2TP is a technology that transports Ethernet Frame on L2TP
   tunnels.  The goal of EoL2TP is to make a connecteion between a
   remote site or system and an LNS located at a local LAN via L2TP
   tunnels. EoL2TP bridges packets between two different LANs
   transparently and safely.

4.2 Why use L2TP tunnels?

   L2TP is the standard protocol that provides a mechanism for
   aggregation of multiple Layer 2 connections across packet oriented
   data networks. It is widely used to build Remote VPNs. EoL2TP works
   on L2TP to provide mechanisms for security, aggregation, and a
   multi-service framework.

4.3 Why use PPP?

   There are many benefits from using PPP. PPP has LQM (Link Quality
   Management) that allows the user to check the health of the path. PPP
   has authentication, encryption and compression.

   These PPP benefits bring flexibility and reliability to users.

5. Models for network configuration

   This section describes some types of models of EoL2TP that we will
   consider.  The first model is a LAN to LAN connection. A LAN to LAN
   connection provides connectivity for many-to-many communication. The
   second model is a HOST to LAN connection. A HOST to LAN connection
   provides connectivity for one-to-many communication.

5.1 LAN to LAN connection

   A LAN to LAN connection assumes the scenario of connecting a remote
   LAN to a central LAN. It MAY use a dial connection or a leased line
   connection.

     ---------                -------------               ---------

   In this model, we can consider two different types of scenarios.  One
   is compulsory tunneling and the other is voluntary tunneling.

5.1.1 LAN to LAN: Compulsory tunnel model

   Compulsory tunneling refers to the model in which a network node or
   gateway connects to a network access server acting as a LAC via a
   dial connection or leased-line. The LAC entity in the access server
   extends a PPP session across a backbone using L2TP to a remote LNS.
   This operation is transparent to the user initiating the PPP session
   to the LAC.

   In the Compulsory tunneling model, there are a number of different
   deployment scenarios possible. In one example, the remote bridge with
   PPP is located at the customer edge. The customer edge device may be
   a gateway that can act as a router and/or bridge. The PPP and BCP
   entity is required on the gateway at the remote LAN in this case.

   In the example shown in Fig 3, the gateway at the remote LAN is a MAC
   bridge defined by [IEEE 802.1D]. The protocol stack of the gateway is
   shown below:

5.1.2 LAN to LAN: Voluntary tunnel model

   The L2TP specification has support for voluntary tunneling. In the
   voluntary tunneling model, the LAC entity can be located on a host,
   as well as on a network node. Note that such a host MAY have two IP
   addresses: one for the LAC-LNS IP tunnel, and the other for the
   network to which the host is connecting. If the user isn't running IP
   over that tunneled PPP session,  then he has no IP address there.

5.3 Consideration for xDSL networks

   xDSL access networks are popular today. PPP is used in xDSL access.
   The configuration and protocol stack are different from dial-up lines
   and leased lines as we discussed in section 5.1 and 5.2. An xDSL
   modem or xDSL router is used at the edge of the customer network.
   Usually, hosts in the customer network connect with the xDSL modem or
   xDSL router via Ethernet using PPPoE (Note: PPPoE is not standards-
   track protocol).  The xDSL line from the customer site is terminated
   by DSL access multiplexers (DSLAM) at the provider edge. The DSLAM
   forwards traffic to the ISP router.  We assume several situations for
   how the ISP router deals with traffic:

    - ISP router terminates the PPP session.
    - ISP router acts as L2TP LAC and tunnels traffic to the central
   network.

   The protocol stack architecture and a L2TP usage example are below:

   We have many options to implement EoL2TP in the xDSL model.  One
   example shown in below expecting PPPoE will implement on xDSL router
   and it function as a Bridge.

6. Requirements for EoL2TP

6.1 Scaling

   The device interconnecting LAN and tunneled network using BCP in
   EoL2TP framework MUST act as a MAC Bridge defined in [IEEE 802.1D].
   To achieve connection of several tens or hundred of LANs, scalability
   SHOULD be considered. Especially for Layer 2 connections, the
   implementation SHOULD support efficiency for traffic. The learning
   and filtering is required for implementation to avoid flooding
   unnecessary forwarding traffic across the Internet.

6.2 Redundancy and avoiding broadcast loops

   The device interconnecting LAN and tunneled network using BCP in
   EoL2TP framework SHOULD act as a MAC Bridge defined in [IEEE 802.1D].
   The Spanning Tree Protocol allows the administrator to configure the
   network with redundant links while avoiding accidental forwarding
   loops.

6.3 Compatibility

   The device interconnecting a LAN and a tunneled network using BCP in
   EoL2TP framework MUST support 802.1Q.  And EoL2TP SHOULD be
   independent from future changes to the IEEE 802.1 standards.  For
   this reason, existing protocols that already track the IEEE standards
   are preferred.

   The compatibility to the IEEE 802.1 standards allow many
   administrators understand it and know how to use it.

6.4 Reliability

   EoL2TP implementation is RECOMMENDED to support PPP LQM.  The LQM
   allows EoL2TP to fail over in the case where there are redundant
   paths with Spanning Tree Protocol or Link Aggregation.

7. BCP/L2TP versus Direct encapsulation

   There was an alternate idea that allowed binding an Ethernet frame on
   a L2TP message field directly without a PPP header. It is in a work-
   in-progress.  We call this "Direct encapsulation".

7.1 Header Overhead in frames

   0) looks like this:

   EoL2TP has an added overhead of three octets compared to "Direct
   Encapsulation".  In the case of a 64 byte minimum packet size, EoL2TP
   adds at most 3.8 percent overhead, which is very small. In addition,
   if it is not necessary to carry the LAN FCS end to end, the LAN FCS
   field in the BCP of EoL2TP is optional. This option can remove the
   four octets of LAN FCS, so the result is one octet shorter than
   "Direct Encapsulation".

   In addition, BCP allows Tinygram compression. This means that EoL2TP
   packets with Tinygram compression are more efficient than "Direct
   encapsulation" packets.

   The many PPP and BCP options that are available bring many benefits
   to EoL2TP.

7.2 Reliability

   EoL2TP uses a PPP framework, so the PPP LQM is available in EoL2TP.
   The LQM allows EoL2TP to fail over in the case where there are
   redundant paths with Spanning Tree Protocol or Link Aggregation.

8. Security Considerations

   EoL2TP does not define any specific security mechanism but instead
   relies PPP and L2TP. This means security mechanisms in PPP such as
   PAP/CHAP/ECP are applicable on EoL2TP. Tunnel authentication of L2TP
   is also applicable. Data encryption can be established by IPsec in
   the case of L2TP over UDP/IP.
