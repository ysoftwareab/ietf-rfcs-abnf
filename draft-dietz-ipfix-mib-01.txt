1.  Open Issues/TODOs
   o  Agree on the fact that only the main configuration objects are
      writeable by this MIB.
   o  Method Table Figure -- The figure must be adjusted to not show any
      particular OID since we don't define the methods right here.  Also
      substitute OID by name!
   o  Need to achieve a common layout and naming on the different MIB
      parts.
   o  Need to decide how to structure the MIB (which one is the basic
      one, which one imports the root from the basic one).
   o  Elaborate security considerations, particularly concerning SET
      operations.
   o  Check the definitions once IPFIX-PROTO is a RFC.
   o  Capitalize all terms defined in the terminology
   o  How to integrate multiple templates for one metering process.
   o  Check usage of process id in instance table.
   o  Check if we need the new definition of session at the exporter and
      rework the whole description of that tables.
   o  How to integrate the following table into the exporter MIB:

   ipfixTemplateManagementTable
     *ipfixObdomainId
     *ipfixTemplateId
      ipfixTemplateScopeCount <- It is used option template.
      ipfixMaximumLength      <- This value means max size of variable field.

      The table should be linked to the current objects somehow.
   o  Include the following tables for IPFIX (* indicated index)

   ipfixFlowCreatParameterTable
    *ipfixMeteringProcessId
     ipfixActiveTimeOut
     ipfixInactiveTimeOut
     ipfixStoreFlowEntryNumber
     ipfixCurrentFlowEntryNumber

   ipfixFlowKeyTable
     *ipfixMeteringProcessId
     *ipfixFlowKeyIndex
      ipfixFlowKeyFieldId


2.  Introduction

   This document defines MIB modules for monitoring IP Flow Information
   Export (IPFIX) Devices including Exporters and Collectors.  The full
   configuration of the IPFIX Metering Process is out of the scope this
   MIB.  However, some configuration of the Exporting Process is

   integrated into this document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  IPFIX Documents Overview

   The IPFIX protocol provides network administrators with access to IP
   flow information.  The architecture for the export of measured IP
   flow information out of an IPFIX exporting process to a collecting
   process is defined in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture], per the
   requirements defined in [RFC3917].  The protocol document [I-D.ietf-
   ipfix-protocol] specifies how IPFIX data record and templates are
   carried via a congestion-aware transport protocol from IPFIX
   exporting processes to IPFIX collecting process.  IPFIX has a formal
   description of IPFIX information elements, their name, type and
   additional semantic information, as specified in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-
   info].  Finally [I-D.ietf-ipfix-as] describes what type of
   applications can use the IPFIX protocol and how they can use the
   information provided.  It furthermore shows how the IPFIX framework
   relates to other architectures and frameworks.

   It is assumed that flow metering, export and collection is performed
   according to the IPFIX architecture defined in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-
   architecture].  Configuration of the export and collection of flow
   information templates and records is modeled according to [I-D.ietf-
   ipfix-protocol].  Packet selection and filtering methods that may be
   optionally used by the IPFIX metering processare not considered in
   this MIB module.  They are defined in the Packet Sampling (PSAMP)
   working group by the [I-D.ietf-psamp-framework], [I-D.ietf-psamp-
   sample-tech] documents.  Nevertheless the entry point for those
   methods [I-D.ietf-psamp-mib] is given within this MIB module since
   PSAMP export protocol [I-D.ietf-psamp-protocol] is based on the IPFIX
   protocol.


4.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the

Internet-Draft                  IPFIX MIB                   October 2006


   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


5.  Terminology

   The definitions of the basic terms like IP Traffic Flow, Exporting
   Process, Collecting Process, Observation Points, etc. are
   semantically identical with those found in the IPFIX protocol
   document [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol].  Some of the terms have been
   expanded for more clarity when defining the protocol.  Additional
   terms required for the protocol has also been defined.  Definitions
   in this document and in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture] are equivalent,
   except that definitions which are only relevant to the IPFIX protocol
   only appear here.

   Observation Point

      An Observation Point is a location in the network where IP packets
      can be observed.  Examples include: a line to which a probe is
      attached, a shared medium, such as an Ethernet-based LAN, a single
      port of a router, or a set of interfaces (physical or logical) of
      a router.
      Note that every Observation Point is associated with an
      Observation Domain (defined below), and that one Observation Point
      may be a superset of several other Observation Points.  For
      example one Observation Point can be an entire line card.  That
      would be the superset of the individual Observation Points at the
      line card's interfaces.

   Observation Domain

      An Observation Domain is the largest set of Observation Points for
      which Flow information can be aggregated by a Metering Process.
      For example, a router line card may be an Observation Domain if it
      is composed of several interfaces, each of which is an Observation
      Point.  In the IPFIX Message it generates, the Observation Domain
      includes its Observation Domain ID, which is unique per Exporting
      Process.  That way, the Collecting Process can identify the
      specific Observation Domain from the Exporter that sends the IPFIX
      Messages.  Every Observation Point is associated with an
      Observation Domain.  It is RECOMMENDED that Observation Domain IDs
      are also unique per IPFIX Device.

   IP Traffic Flow or Flow

      There are several definitions of the term 'flow' being used by the
      Internet community.  Within the context of IPFIX we use the
      following definition:

      A Flow is defined as a set of IP packets passing an Observation
      Point in the network during a certain time interval.  All packets
      belonging to a particular Flow have a set of common properties.
      Each property is defined as the result of applying a function to
      the values of:

      1.  one or more packet header field (e.g. destination IP address),
          transport header field (e.g. destination port number), or
          application header field (e.g.  RTP header fields [RFC1889])
      2.  one or more characteristics of the packet itself (e.g. number
          of MPLS labels, etc...)
      3.  one or more of fields derived from packet treatment (e.g. next
          hop IP address, the output interface, etc...)

      A packet is defined to belong to a Flow if it completely satisfies
      all the defined properties of the Flow.
      This definition covers the range from a Flow containing all
      packets observed at a network interface to a Flow consisting of
      just a single packet between two applications.  It includes
      packets selected by a sampling mechanism.

   Flow Record

      A Flow Record contains information about a specific Flow that was
      observed at an Observation Point.  A Flow Record contains measured
      properties of the Flow (e.g. the total number of bytes for all the
      Flow's packets) and usually characteristic properties of the Flow
      (e.g. source IP address).

   Metering Process

      The Metering Process generates Flow Records.  Inputs to the
      process are packet headers and characteristics observed at an
      Observation Point, and packet treatment at the Observation Point
      (for example the selected output interface).
      The Metering Process consists of a set of functions that includes
      packet header capturing, timestamping, sampling, classifying, and
      maintaining Flow Records.






Dietz, et al.         draft-dietz-ipfix-mib-01.txt              [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  IPFIX MIB                   October 2006


      The maintenance of Flow Records may include creating new records,
      updating existing ones, computing Flow statistics, deriving
      further Flow properties, detecting Flow expiration, passing Flow
      Records to the Exporting Process, and deleting Flow Records.

   Exporting Process

      The Exporting Process sends Flow Records to one or more Collecting
      Processes.  The Flow Records are generated by one or more Metering
      Processes.

   Exporter

      A device which hosts one or more Exporting Processes is termed an
      Exporter.

   IPFIX Device

      An IPFIX Device hosts at least one Exporting Process.  It may host
      further Exporting processes and arbitrary numbers of Observation
      Points and Metering Process.

   Collecting Process

      A Collecting Process receives Flow Records from one or more
      Exporting Processes.  The Collecting Process might process or
      store received Flow Records, but such actions are out of scope for
      this document.

   Collector

      A device which hosts one or more Collecting Processes is termed a
      Collector.

   Template

      Template is an ordered sequence of <type, length> pairs, used to
      completely specify the structure and semantics of a particular set
      of information that needs to be communicated from an IPFIX Device
      to a Collector.  Each Template is uniquely identifiable by means
      of a Template ID.

   Template Record








Dietz, et al.         draft-dietz-ipfix-mib-01.txt              [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                  IPFIX MIB                   October 2006


      A Template Record defines the structure and interpretation of
      fields in a Data Record.

   Data Record

      A Data Record is a record that contains values of the parameters
      corresponding to a Template Record.

   Options Template Record

      An Options Template Record is a Template Record that defines the
      structure and interpretation of fields in a Data Record, including
      defining how to scope the applicability of the Data Record.

   Information Element

      An Information Element is a protocol and encoding independent
      description of an attribute which may appear in an IPFIX Record.
      The IPFIX information model [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] defines the base
      set of Information Elements for IPFIX.  The type associated with
      an Information Element indicates constraints on what it may
      contain and also determines the valid encoding mechanisms for use
      in IPFIX.

   Method

      A sampling or filtering function used by a Metering Process.
      Methods can be combined by passing the results from one function
      as the input to the next function.

   Instance

      An Instance groups the different parts together.  It references
      the Methods used by the Metering Process, the Templates used to
      export the resulting Records of the Metering Process and the
      Collectors to which those Records are exported.



6.  Structure of the IPFIX MIB

   The IPFIX MIB is divided into three more or less independent modules:
   The IPFIX Exporter MIB module used to be applied by IPFIX Exporters,
   the IPFIX Collector MIB module to be applied by IPFIX Collectors and
   the PSAMP MIB module that extends the IPFIX Exporter MIB module by
   managed objects concerning packet filtering and sampling.  While the
   first two MIB modules are defined in this document, the PSAMP MIB
   module is defined in [I-D.ietf-psamp-mib].

Internet-Draft                  IPFIX MIB                   October 2006


   o  The IPFIX Exporter MIB module contains objects related to
      exporting flow information with the IPFIX protocol to one or more
      IPFIX Collectors.  It contains detailed information on each
      Collector to which information is exported and on each Template
      that is used for this purpose by the IPFIX protocol.  It also
      contains some basic structures for describing the chain of
      sampling or filtering Methods that optionally can be applied to
      the flow Metering Process.  Finally this MIB module provides
      statistics on the Metering Process(es) and Exporting Process(es).
   o  The IPFIX Collector MIB contains objects related to collecting
      flow information sent by IPFIX Exporters.  It contains detailed
      information on each Exporters from which information has been
      received and on the Templates received from the Exporters.  In
      addition, statistics information is provided.
   o  The PSAMP MIB module part contains objects related to packet
      filtering and sampling before they are used for creating flow
      records.  Sampling and filtering functions can be optionally
      applied by a Metering Process.  The PSAMP MIB module contains
      objects providing statistics for sampling and filtering functions.

   The following subsections describe all object groups in the IPFIX
   Exproter MIB module and the IPFIX Collector MIB module.

6.1.  IPFIX Exporter MIB module

6.1.1.  The Reporting Group

   The reporting group of managed objects provides information on
   Collectors to which flow information is exported.  The group contains
   two tables, the ipfixCollectorTable and the ipfixCollectorGroupTable.

   Each entry in the ipfixCollectorTable specifies a collector by its IP
   address, used transport protocol and port number.  Also it contains
   the number of reports sent to this collector.  The default transport
   protocol is SCTP.

   The ipfixCollectorGroupTable groups one or more collectors to a set
   of collectors where flow information is sent to.  Thus reporting to
   more than one collector at the same time is possible.  The
   ipfixCollectorGroupTable contains only indexes but nevertheless it is
   usefull since it is referenced in the ipfixInstanceTable.  This table
   groups single collectors referenced by the second index
   (ipfixCollectorIndex) to a group of collectors that can be
   subsequently be referenced by the first index
   (ipfixCollectorGroupIndex).

Internet-Draft                  IPFIX MIB                   October 2006


6.1.2.  The Instance Group

   The instance group of managed objects provides information about
   active Instances at the IPFIX exporter.  It also allows to create new
   instances and to terminate them.  Furthermore in the instance group
   every part from observation point to reporting is put together.

   The group contains three tables, the ipfixInstanceTable, the
   ipfixMethodChainTable and the ipfixTemplateTable.  Each entry of the
   ipfixInstanceTable describes an instance.  The observation point is
   given as a pointer to another object in
   ipfixInstanceObservationPoint.  This other object could be an entry
   in the mib-II interface table or any other interface point where you
   can observe packets.  The start and stop time is stored in that table
   and shows the time when the metering method should run.  The
   ipfixInstanceTemplateId gives the template id used to link the data
   gathered in the metering process to an export format described in the
   information model of the IPFIX architecture.  The collectors where
   the data packets should be sent are specified by their index in the
   ipfixCollectorGroupTable.  In addition the process id of the metering
   process and the process id of the exporting process used for this
   instance is saved in the instance table.  Last but not least
   statistical values about the packets observed at the observation
   point, packets dropped during the metering process and the reports
   sent to the collectors are maintained.

   The ipfixMethodChainTable describes the concatenation of methods for
   a given instance.  If concatenation of methods is not supported on
   the IPFIX device the table will hold exactly one entry per instance.

   The methods used for the metering process of an instance can be
   retrieved through the index given in the ipfixInstanceTable.  The
   index of the instance table is also the first index in the
   ipfixMethodChainTable.  So each method entry with the same (first)
   index as the instance is used to produce the data record for the
   instance.  The second index is the running index for the method.  The
   method itself is represented by a pointer (OID) to a parameter set.
   The methods are applied in the order given by this second index
   ipfixMethodChainIndex.  Assume the following table:

   1.2.4.1.2.5.1 = 1 (second index)
   1.2.4.1.2.5.2 = 2 (second index)
   1.2.4.1.3.5.1 = 1.3.6.1.2.1.999.3.a.b.c.d.e
     (pointer to a parameter set in the IPFIX PAMP extension MIB)
   1.2.4.1.3.5.2 = 1.3.6.1.2.1.999.3.a.b.c.f.g
     (pointer to another parameter set in the IPFIX PAMP extension MIB)
   1.2.4.1.4.5.1 = xxx (status of the row)
   1.2.4.1.4.5.2 = xxx (status of the row)



Dietz, et al.         draft-dietz-ipfix-mib-01.txt             [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                  IPFIX MIB                   October 2006


   This would mean that the method and parameter set specified by
   1.3.6.1.2.1.999.3.a.b.c.d.e is applied prior to the method and
   parameter set specified by 1.3.6.1.2.1.999.3.a.b.c.f.g for the
   instance with index 5.

   In addition every entry in the method chain table contains two
   statistical values: the packets observed at the entry point of the
   method and the packets dropped by the method.

   The ipfixTemplateTable lists all data templates that are used by the
   IPFIX exporter.  It has two indices.  The first one is the template
   id and the second one is just a running index for the field ids
   listed in the table.  So the ipfixTemplateEntry.4.x will list all
   field ids used for template id 4 in the order given by x.

6.1.3.  The Statistics Group

   The objects of contained in the statistics conformance group are
   spread all over the MIB.  They are gathered in their own conformace
   group to better to easily distinguish them from the vital objects.

6.1.4.  Textual Convention

   The IPFIX Exporter MIB defines a textual convention, the
   PsampMethodAvailability.  It is used as SYNTAX of all those objects
   that may or may not be available in a specific implementation of the
   MIB.  This especially holds true for the sampling and filtering
   methods specified by [I-D.ietf-psamp-mib].

6.2.  IPFIX Collector MIB module

6.2.1.  The Exporter Group

   The objects defined in the exporter group are used in the collector
   MIB to define the exporters from which the collector receives data.

6.2.2.  The Received Template Group

   The received template group identifies all the templates the
   collector has received from the exporter.  It additionally links the
   template to an exporter.

6.2.3.  The Template Statistics Group

   The template statistics group gathers all the objects that contain
   statistical information about the templates a collector has received.

7.  MIB Definitions

   This section contains the definitions of the IPFIX-EXPORTER-MIB and
   the IPFIX-COLLECTOR-MIB modules.  Exporter-realted and Collector-
   realted objects are defined in two separate MIB modules, because
   commonly, a device will implement only one of them.  Then either the
   IPFIX-EXPORTER-MIB modules or the IPFIX-COLLECTOR-MIB module needs to
   be implemented.

           "The IPFIX MIB defines managed objects for IP flow
            information export.  These objects provide information about
            managed nodes supporting IP flow information export,
            including flow information export capabilities,
            configuration and statistics.  They also allow to configure
            IP flow information export concerning the IP interface at
            which flow information is gathered, the flow selections
            methods used, and the collector to which flow information is
            exported.

8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires an OID assignment to be made by IANA:
