 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
 1.    Introduction 
  
 1.1.     The H.264 codec 
  
   This memo specifies an RTP payload specification for the video 
   coding standard known as ITU-T Recommendation H.264 [1] and ISO/IEC 
   International Standard 14496 Part 10 (also known as MPEG-4 Advanced 
   Video Coding) [2].  Recommendation H.264 was approved by ITU-T on 
   May 2003, and the approved draft specification is available for 
   public review [8].  In this memo the H.264 acronym is used for the 
   codec and the standard, but the memo is equally applicable to the 
   ISO/IEC counterpart of the coding standard. 
  
   The H.264 video codec has a very broad application range that 
   covers all forms of digital compressed video from low bit rate 
   Internet Streaming applications to HDTV broadcast and Digital 
   Cinema applications with near loss-less coding.  Most, if not all, 
   relevant companies in all of these fields (including Video-
   Conferencing, Streaming, TV broadcast, and Digital Cinema) have 
   participated in the standardization, which gives hope that this 
   wide application range is more than an illusion and may 
   materialize, probably in a relatively short time frame.  The 
   overall performance of H.264 is as such that bit rate savings of 
   50% or more, compared to the current state of technology, are 
   reported.  Digital Satellite TV quality, for example, was reported 
   to be achievable at 1.5 Mbit/s, compared to the current operation 
   point of MPEG 2 video at around 3.5 Mbit/s [9]. 
    
   The codec specification [1] itself distinguishes conceptually 
   between a video coding layer (VCL), and a network abstraction layer 
   (NAL).  The VCL contains the signal processing functionality of the 
   codec, things such as transform, quantization, motion 
   search/compensation, and the loop filter.  It follows the general 
   concept of most of today's video codecs, a macroblock-based coder 
   that utilizes inter picture prediction with motion compensation, 
   and transform coding of the residual signal.  The VCL encoder 
   outputs slices: a bit string that contains the macroblock data of 
   an integer number of macroblocks, and the information of the slice 
   header (containing the spatial address of the first macroblock in 
   the slice, the initial quantization parameter, and similar).  
   Macroblocks in slices are ordered in scan order unless a different

 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
   macroblock allocation is specified, using the so-called Flexible 
   Macroblock Ordering syntax.  In-picture prediction is used only 
   within a slice.  More information is provided in [8].  
    
   The NAL encoder encapsulates the slice output of the VCL encoder 
   into Network Abstraction Layer Units (NAL units), which are 
   suitable for the transmission over packet networks or the use in 
   packet oriented multiplex environments.  Annex B of H.264 defines 
   an encapsulation process to transmit such NAL units over byte-
   stream oriented networks.  In the scope of this memo Annex B is not 
   relevant. 
    
   Internally, the NAL uses NAL units.  A NAL unit consists of a one-
   byte header and the payload byte string.  The header co-serves as 
   the RTP payload header and indicates the type of the NAL unit, the 
   (potential) presence of bit errors or syntax violations in the NAL 
   unit payload, and information regarding the relative importance of 
   the NAL unit for the decoding process.  This RTP payload 
   specification is designed to be unaware of the bit string in the 
   NAL unit payload. 
    
   One of the main properties of H.264 is the complete decoupling of 
   the transmission time, the decoding time, and the sampling or 
   presentation time of slices and pictures.  The decoding process 
   specified in H.264 is unaware of time, and the H.264 syntax does 
   not carry information such as the number of skipped frames (as 
   common in the form of the Temporal Reference in earlier video 
   compression standards).  Also, there are NAL units that are 
   affecting many pictures and are, hence, inherently time-less.  For 
   this reason, the handling of the RTP timestamp requires some 
   special considerations for those NAL units for which the sampling 
   or presentation time is not defined, or, at transmission time, 
   unknown. 
    
    
 1.2.     Parameter Set Concept 
    
     One very fundamental design concept of H.264 is to generate self-
   contained packets, to make mechanisms such as the header 
   duplication of RFC 2429 [11] or MPEG-4's HEC [12] unnecessary.  The 
 Wenger et. al.    Expires December 2003              [Page 6] 

 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
   way how this was achieved is to decouple information that is 
   relevant to more than one slice from the media stream.  This higher 
   layer meta information should be sent reliably, asynchronously and 
   in advance from the RTP packet stream that contains the slice 
   packets.  (Provisions for sending this information in-band are also 
   available for such applications that do not have an out-of-band 
   transport channel appropriate for the purpose).  The combination of 
   the higher-level parameters is called a parameter set.  The H.264 
   specification includes two types of parameter sets: sequence 
   parameter set and picture parameter set.  An active sequence 
   parameter set remains unchanged throughout a coded video sequence, 
   and an active picture parameter set remains unchanged within a 
   coded picture.  The sequence and picture parameter set structures 
   contain information such as picture size, optional coding modes 
   employed, and macroblock to slice group map. 
      
   In order to be able to change picture parameters (such as the 
   picture size), without having the need to transmit parameter set 
   updates synchronously to the slice packet stream, the encoder and 
   decoder can maintain a list of more than one sequence and picture 
   parameter set.  Each slice header contains a codeword that 
   indicates the sequence and picture parameter set to be used.   
    
   This mechanism allows to decouple the transmission of parameter 
   sets from the packet stream, and transmit them by external means, 
   e.g. as a side effect of the capability exchange, or through a 
   (reliable or unreliable) control protocol.  It may even be possible 
   that they get never transmitted but are fixed by an application 
   design specification. 
    
    
 1.3.     Network Abstraction Layer Unit Types 
  
   Tutorial information on the NAL design can be found in [13], 
   [14] and [15].   
    
   All NAL units consist of a single NAL unit type octet, which also 
   co-serves as the payload header.  The payload of a NAL unit follows 
   immediately.

 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
   The syntax and semantics of the NAL unit type octet are specified 
   in [1], but the essential properties of the NAL unit type octet are 
   summarized below.  The NAL unit type octet has the following 
   format: 
    
   +---------------+ 
   |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7| 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |F|NRI|  Type   | 
   +---------------+ 
    
   The semantics of the components of the NAL unit type octet, as 
   specified in the H.264 specification, are described briefly below. 
    
   F: 1 bit 
      forbidden_zero_bit.  The H.264 specification declares a value of 
      1 as a syntax violation.   
       
   NRI: 2 bits 
      nal_ref_idc.  A value of 00 indicates that the content of the 
      NAL unit is not used to reconstruct reference pictures for inter 
      picture prediction.  Such NAL units can be discarded without 
      risking the integrity of the reference pictures.  Values greater 
      than 00 indicate that the decoding of the NAL unit is required 
      to maintain the integrity of the reference pictures.   
    
   Type: 5 bits 
      nal_unit_type.  The NAL unit payload type as defined in table 7-
      1 of [1], and later within this memo.  For a reference of all 
      currently defined NAL unit types and their semantics please 
      refer to section 7.4.1 in [1].   
    
   This memo introduces new NAL unit types, which are introduced in 
   Section 5.2.  Note that the NAL unit types defined in this memo are 
   marked as unspecified in [1].  Moreover, this specification extends 
   the semantics of F and NRI as described in section 5.3.

 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3]. 
    
   This specification uses the notion of setting and clearing a bit 
   when handling bit fields.  Setting a bit is the same as assigning 
   that bit the value of 1 (On).  Clearing a bit is the same as 
   assigning that bit the value of 0 (Off). 
    
  
 3.    Scope 
  
   This payload specification can only be used to carry the "naked" 
   H.264 NAL unit stream over RTP.  Likely, the first applications of 
   this specification will be in the conversational multimedia field, 
   video telephone or video conference.  The draft is not intended for 
   the use in conjunction with the byte stream format of Annex B of 
   H.264. 
    
    
 4.    Definitions and Abbreviations 
    
 4.1.     Definitions 
  
   This document uses the definitions of [1].  The following terms 
   defined in [1] are summed up below for convenience: 
    
      access unit: A set of NAL units always containing a primary 
      coded picture.  In addition to the primary coded picture, an 
      access unit may also contain one or more redundant coded 
      pictures or other NAL units not containing slices or slice data 
      partitions of a coded picture.  The decoding of an access unit 
      always results in a decoded picture. 
    
      coded video sequence: A sequence of access units that consists, 
      in decoding order, of an IDR access unit followed zero or more 
      non-IDR access units including all subsequent access units up to 
      but not including any subsequent IDR access unit. 
       
      instantaneous decoding refresh (IDR) access unit: An access unit 
      in which the primary coded picture is an IDR picture.

 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
       
      instantaneous decoding refresh (IDR) picture: A coded picture 
      containing only slices with I or SI slice types that causes a 
      "reset" in the decoding process.  After the decoding of an IDR 
      picture all following coded pictures in decoding order can be 
      decoded without inter prediction from any picture decoded prior 
      to the IDR picture. 
    
      primary coded picture: The coded representation of a picture to 
      be used by the decoding process for a bitstream conforming to 
      H.264.  The primary coded picture contains all macroblocks of 
      the picture. 
    
      redundant coded picture: A coded representation of a picture or 
      a part of a picture.  The content of a redundant coded picture 
      shall not be used by the decoding process for a bitstream 
      conforming to H.264.  The content of a redundant coded picture 
      may be used by the decoding process for a bitstream that 
      contains errors or losses. 
       
      VCL NAL unit: A collective term used to refer to coded slice and 
      coded data partition NAL units. 
    
   In addition, the following definitions apply: 
    
      decoding order number (DON): A field in the payload structure or 
      a derived variable indicating NAL unit decoding order.  Values 
      of DON are in the range of 0 to 65535, inclusive.  After 
      reaching the maximum value, the value of DON wraps around to 0. 
       
      NAL unit decoding order: A NAL unit order that conforms to the 
      constraints on NAL unit order given in section 7.4.1.2 in [1].   
    
      transmission order: The order of packets in ascending RTP 
      sequence number order (in modulo arithmetic).  Within an 
      aggregation packet, the NAL unit transmission order is the same 
      as the order of appearance of NAL units in the packet.

 5.    RTP Payload Format 
    
 5.1.     RTP Header Usage 
  
   The format of the RTP header is specified in RFC 3550 [4] and 
   reprinted in Figure 1 for convenience.  This payload format uses 
   the fields of the header in a manner consistent with that 
   specification. 
    
   When encapsulating one NAL unit per RTP packet, the RECOMMENDED RTP 
   payload format is specified in section 5.6.  The RTP payload (and 
   the settings for some RTP header bits) for aggregation packets and 
   fragmentation units are specified in sections 5.7 and 5.8, 
   respectively.

   Figure 1: RTP header according RFC 3550. 
    
   The RTP header information is set as follows:  
    
   Version (V): 2 bits 
      Set to 2 according to RFC 3550. 
    
   Padding (P): 1 bit 
      Used according to RFC 3550. 
    
   Extension (X): 1 bit 
      Used according to RFC 3550 and profile definitions. 
    
   CSRC count (CC): 4 bits 
      Used according to RFC 3550. 
    
   Marker bit (M): 1 bit 
      Set for the very last packet of the access unit indicated by the 
      RTP timestamp, in line with the normal use of the M bit in video 
      formats and to allow an efficient playout buffer handling.  
      Decoders MAY use this bit as an early indication of the last 
      packet of an access unit, but MUST NOT rely on this property. 
      Informative note: Only one M bit is associated with an 
      aggregation packet carrying multiple NAL units, and thus if a

   Payload type (PT): 7 bits 
      The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new packet format 
      is outside the scope of this document, and will not be specified 
      here.  The assignment of a payload type needs to be performed 
      either through the profile used or in a dynamic way. 
    
   Sequence number (SN): 16 bits 
      Increased by one for each sent packet.  Set to a random value 
      during startup as per RFC 3550 
    
   Timestamp: 32 bits 
      The RTP timestamp is set to the sampling timestamp of the 
      content.  A 90 kHz clock rate MUST be used.   
       
      If the NAL unit has no own timing properties (e.g. parameter set 
      and SEI NAL units), the RTP timestamp is set to the RTP 
      timestamp of the primary coded picture of the access unit to 
      which the NAL unit is included according to section 7.4.1.2 of 
      [1].   
       
      The setting of the RTP Timestamp for MTAPs is defined in section 
      5.7.2. 
       
      If the content is a part of a coded frame that was sampled as 
      two fields having distinct sampling times and that is supposed 
      to be displayed as fields having distinct display times, the RTP 
      timestamp MUST be set to the sampling timestamp of the latest 
      sampled field.  In addition, the picture timing supplemental 
      enhancement information (SEI) message (subclauses D.1.2 and 
      D.2.2 of [1]) SHOULD be used to convey the timestamps for 
      display, and the last clock timestamp in decoding order conveyed 
      in a picture timing SEI message MUST correspond to the RTP 
      timestamp of the primary coded picture of the same access unit.   
       
      Informative note: Displaying coded frames as fields is needed 
      commonly in an operation known as 3:2 pulldown where film 
      content that consists of coded frames is displayed on an display 
      using interlaced scanning.  The picture timing SEI message 
      enables carriage of multiple timestamps for the same coded

      picture, and therefore the 3:2 pulldown process is perfectly 
      controlled.  The picture timing SEI message mechanism is 
      necessary, because only one timestamp per coded frame can be 
      conveyed in the RTP timestamp.  
       
      Receivers SHOULD ignore any picture timing SEI messages included 
      in access units that have only one display timestamp.  Instead, 
      receivers SHOULD use the RTP timestamp for synchronizing the 
      display process. 
       
      RTP senders SHOULD NOT transmit picture timing SEI messages for 
      pictures that are not supposed to be displayed as multiple 
      fields. 
    
   Synchronization source (SSRC) identifier: 32 bits 
      Used according to RFC 3550. 
    
   Contributing source (CSRC) identifiers: 0 to 15 items, 32 bits each

 5.2.     Common structure of the RTP payload format 
    
   The payload format is defined as a number of different payload 
   structures depending on need.  However, which structure a received 
   RTP packet contains is evident from the first byte of the payload.  
   This byte will always be structured as a NAL unit header.  The NAL 
   unit type field indicates which structure is present.  The possible 
   structures are: 
    
   Single NAL Unit Packet: Contains only a single NAL unit in the 
   payload.  The NAL header type field will be equal to the original 
   NAL unit type, i.e., in the range of 1 to 23, inclusive.  Specified 
   in section 5.6. 
    
   Aggregation packet: Packet type used to aggregate multiple NAL 
   units into a single RTP payload.  This packet exists in four 
   versions, the Single-Time Aggregation Packet type A (STAP-A), the 
   Single-Time Aggregation Packet type B (STAP-B), Multi-Time 
   Aggregation Packet (MTAP) with 16 bit offset (MTAP16), and Multi-

   Time Aggregation Packet (MTAP) with 24 bit offset (MTAP24).  The 
   NAL unit type numbers assigned for STAP-A, STAP-B, MTAP16, and 
   MTAP24 are 24, 25, 26, and 27 respectively.  Specified in section 
   5.7. 
    
   Fragmentation unit: Used to fragment a single NAL unit over 
   multiple RTP packets.  Exists with two versions identified with the 
   NAL unit type numbers 28 and 29.  Specified in section 5.8.

 5.3.     NAL Unit Octet Usage 
    
   The structure and semantics of the NAL unit octet were introduced 
   in section 1.3.  For convenience, the format of the NAL unit type 
   octet is reprinted below:

   |F|NRI|  Type   | 
   +---------------+ 
    
   This section specifies the semantics of F and NRI according to this 
   specification.   
    
   F: 1 bit 
      forbidden_zero_bit.  A value of 0 indicates that the NAL unit 
      type octet and payload SHOULD not contain bit errors or other 
 Wenger et. al.    Expires December 2003             [Page 15]

      syntax violations.  A value of 1 indicates that the NAL unit 
      type octet and payload MAY contain bit errors or other syntax 
      violations. 
       
      Network elements, such as gateways, MAY set the F bit to 
      indicate detected bit errors in the NAL unit.  The H.264 
      specification requires that the F bit is equal to 0.  Thus, 
      receivers MUST NOT pass NAL units in which the F bit is equal to 
      1 to the decoder, when the decoder is incapable of handling 
      erroneous bitstreams.  Otherwise, when the decoder is capable of 
      handling erroneous bitstreams, receivers SHOULD pass NAL unit in 
      which the F bit is equal to 1 to the decoder.  When the F bit is 
      set, the decoder is advised that bit errors or any other syntax 
      violation may be present in the payload or in the NAL unit type 
      octet.  The simplest decoder reaction to respond to a NAL unit 
      in which the F bit is equal to 1 is to discard such a NAL unit 
      and to conceal the lost data in the discarded NAL unit. 
       
   NRI: 2 bits 
      nal_ref_idc.  The semantics of value 00 and a non-zero value 
      remain unchanged compared to the H.264 specification.  In other 
      words, a value of 00 indicates that the content of the NAL unit 
      is not used to reconstruct reference pictures for inter picture 
      prediction.  Such NAL units can be discarded without risking the 
      integrity of the reference pictures.  Values above 00 indicate 
      that the decoding of the NAL unit is required to maintain the 
      integrity of the reference pictures.   
       
      In addition to the specification above, according to this RTP 
      payload specification, values of NRI greater than 00 indicate 
      the relative transport priority, as determined by the encoder.  
      Intelligent network elements can use this information to protect 
      more important NAL units better than less important NAL units.  
      11 is the highest transport priority, followed by 10, then by 01 
      and, finally, 00 is the lowest. 
       
      Informative note: Any non-zero value of NRI is handled 
      identically in H.264 decoders.  Therefore, receivers need not 
      manipulate the value of NRI when passing NAL units to the 
      decoder.

 5.4.     Packetization Modes 
    
   This memo specifies three cases of packetization modes: 
   o Single NAL unit mode 
   o Non-interleaved mode 
   o Interleaved mode 
    
   The single NAL unit mode is targeted for conversational systems 
   that comply with ITU-T Recommendation H.241 [16] (see section 
   10.1).  The non-interleaved mode is targeted for conversational 
   systems that may not comply with ITU-T Recommendation H.241.  In 
   the non-interleaved mode NAL units are transmitted in NAL unit 
   decoding order.  The interleaved mode is targeted for systems that 
   do not require very low end-to-end latency.  The interleaved mode 
   allows transmission of NAL units out of NAL unit decoding order. 
    
   The packetization mode in use MAY be signaled by the value of the 
   optional packetization-mode MIME parameter or by external means.  
   The used packetization mode governs which NAL unit types are 
   allowed in RTP payloads.  Table 2 summarizes the allowed NAL unit 
   types for each packetization mode.  "No" in the "type 1-23" row 
   indicates that an RTP payload cannot contain a single NAL unit 
   whose type is in the range of 1 to 23, inclusive.  Packetization 
   modes are explained in detail in section 6.

 5.5.     Decoding Order Number (DON) 
    
   In the interleaved packetization mode, the transmission order of 
   NAL units is allowed to differ from the decoding order of the NAL 
   units.  Decoding order number (DON) is a field in the payload 
   structure or a derived variable that indicates the NAL unit 
   decoding order.  Rationale and example use cases for transmission 
   out of decoding order and for the use of DON are given in section 
   11. 
    
   The coupling of transmission and decoding order is controlled by 
   the optional interleaving-depth MIME parameter as follows.  When 
   the value of the optional interleaving-depth MIME parameter is 
   equal to 0 and transmission of NAL units out of their decoding 
   order is disallowed by external means, the transmission order of 
   NAL units MUST conform to the NAL unit decoding order.  When the 
   value of the optional interleaving-depth MIME parameter is greater 
   than 0 or transmission of NAL units out of their decoding order is 
   allowed by external means, 
   o the order of NAL units in an MTAP16 and an MTAP24 is NOT REQUIRED 
     to be the NAL unit decoding order, and 
   o the order of NAL units composed by decapsulating STAP-Bs, MTAPs, 
     and FUs in two consecutive packets is NOT REQUIRED to be the NAL 
     unit decoding order. 
    
   The RTP payload structures for a single NAL unit packet, an STAP-A, 
   and an FU-A do not include DON.  STAP-B and FU-B structures include 
   DON, and the structure of MTAPs enables derivation of DON as 
   specified in section 5.7.2. 
    
   Informative note: If a transmitter wants to encapsulate one NAL 
   unit per packet and transmit packets out of their decoding order, 
   STAP-B packet type can be used. 
    
   In the single NAL unit packetization mode, the transmission order 
   of NAL units MUST be the same as their NAL unit decoding order.  In 
   the non-interleaved packetization mode, the transmission order of 
   NAL units in single NAL unit packets and STAP-As, and FU-As MUST be

 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
   the same as their NAL unit decoding order.  The NAL units within an 
   STAP MUST appear in the NAL unit decoding order.   
    
   Informative note: Due to the fact that H.264 allows the decoding 
   order to be different from the display order, values of RTP 
   timestamps may not be monotonically non-decreasing as a function of 
   RTP sequence numbers. 
    
   Signaling of the value of DON for NAL units carried in STAP-B, 
   MTAP, and a series of fragmentation units starting with an FU-B is 
   specified in sections 5.7.1, 5.7.2, and 5.8 respectively.  The DON 
   value of the first NAL unit in transmission order MAY be set to any 
   value.  Values of DON are in the range of 0 to 65535, inclusive.  
   After reaching the maximum value, the value of DON wraps around to 
   0.   
    
   The decoding order of two NAL units contained in any STAP-B, MTAP, 
   or a series of fragmentation units starting with an FU-B is 
   determined as follows.  Let the value of DON of one NAL unit be D1 
   and the value of DON of another NAL unit be D2.  If D1 equals to 
   D2, then the NAL unit decoding order of the two NAL units can be 
   whichever.  If D1 < D2 and D2 - D1 < 32768, or if D1 > D2 and D1 -
    D2 >= 32768, then the NAL unit having a value of DON equal to D1 
   precedes the NAL unit having a value of DON equal to D2 in NAL unit 
   decoding order.  If D1 < D2 and D2 - D1 >= 32768, or if D1 > D2 and 
   D1 - D2 < 32768, then the NAL unit having a value of DON equal to 
   D2 precedes the NAL unit having a value of DON equal to D1 in NAL 
   unit decoding order.   
    
   Values of DON related fields (DON, DONB, and DOND, see section 5.7) 
   MUST be such that the decoding order determined by the values of 
   DON as specified above conforms to the NAL unit decoding order.  If 
   the order of two consecutive NAL units in the NAL unit stream is 
   switched and the new order still conforms to the NAL unit decoding 
   order, the NAL units MAY have the same value of DON.  For example, 
   when arbitrary slice order is allowed by the video coding profile 
   in use, all the coded slice NAL units of a coded picture are 
   allowed to have the same value of DON.  Consequently, NAL units 
   having the same value of DON can be decoded in any order, and two 
   NAL units having a different value of DON should be passed to the

 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
   decoder in the order specified above.  When two consecutive NAL 
   units in the NAL unit decoding order have a different value of DON, 
   the value of DON for the second NAL unit in decoding order SHOULD 
   be the value of DON for the first NAL unit in decoding order 
   incremented by one. 
    
   An example decapsulation process to recover the NAL unit decoding 
   order is given in section 7.   
    
   Informative note: Receivers SHOULD not expect that the absolute 
   difference of values of DON for two consecutive NAL units in the 
   NAL unit decoding order is equal to one even in case of error-free 
   transmission.  An increment by one is not required, because at the 
   time of associating values of DON to NAL units, it may not be 
   known, whether all NAL units are delivered to the receiver.  For 
   example, a gateway may not forward coded slice NAL units of non-
   reference pictures or SEI NAL units, when there is a shortage of 
   bitrate in the network to which the packets are forwarded.  In 
   another example a live broadcast is interrupted by pre-encoded 
   content such as commercials from time to time.  The first intra 
   picture of a pre-encoded clip is transmitted in advance to ensure 
   that it is readily available in the receiver.  At the time of 
   transmitting the first intra picture, the originator does not 
   exactly know how many NAL units are going to be encoded before the 
   first intra picture of the pre-encoded clip follows in decoding 
   order.  Thus, the values of DON for the NAL units of the first 
   intra picture of the pre-encoded clip have to be estimated at the 
   time of transmitting them and gaps in values of DON may occur. 
    
    
 5.6.     Single NAL Unit Packet 
    
   The single NAL unit packet defined here MUST contain one and only 
   one NAL unit of the types defined in [1].  This means that neither 
   an aggregation packet nor a fragmentation unit can be used within a 
   single NAL unit packet.  A NAL unit stream composed by 
   decapsulating single NAL unit packets in RTP sequence number order 
   MUST conform to the NAL unit decoding order.  The structure of the 
   single NAL unit packet is shown in Figure 2.

 5.7.     Aggregation Packets 
    
   Aggregation packets are the NAL unit aggregation scheme of this 
   payload specification.  The scheme is introduced to reflect the 
   dramatically different MTU sizes of two key target networks -- 
   wireline IP networks (with an MTU size that is often limited by the 
   Ethernet MTU size -- roughly 1500 bytes), and IP or non-IP (e.g. 
   ITU-T H.324/M) based wireless communication systems with preferred 
   transmission unit sizes of 254 bytes or less.  In order to prevent 
   media transcoding between the two worlds, and to avoid undesirable 
   packetization overhead, a NAL unit aggregation scheme is 
   introduced. 
    
   Two types of aggregation packets are defined by this specification: 
    
   o Single-time aggregation packet (STAP) aggregates NAL units with 
     identical NALU-time.  Two types of STAPs are defined, one without 
     DON (STAP-A) and another one including DON (STAP-B). 
   o Multi-time aggregation packet (MTAP) aggregates NAL units with 
     potentially differing NALU-time.  Two different MTAPs are defined 
     that differ in the length of the NAL unit timestamp offset.

 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
   The term NALU-time is defined as the value that the RTP timestamp 
   would have if that NAL unit would be transported in its own RTP 
   packet.  
    
   Each NAL unit to be carried in an aggregation packet is 
   encapsulated in an aggregation unit.  Please see below for the 
   three different aggregation units and their characteristics.

   MTAPs and STAPs share the following packetization rules:  The RTP 
   timestamp MUST be set to the earliest of the NALU times of all the 
   NAL units to be aggregated.  The type field of the NAL unit type 
   octet MUST be set to the appropriate value as indicated in Table 3.  
   The F bit MUST be cleared if all F bits of the aggregated NAL units 
   are zero, otherwise it MUST be set.  The value of NRI MUST be the 
   maximum of all the NAL units carried in the aggregation packet.

   The payload of an aggregation packet consists of one or more 
   aggregation units.  See section 5.7.1 and 5.7.2 for the three 
   different types of aggregation units.  An aggregation packet can 
   carry as many aggregation units as necessary, however the total 
   amount of data in an aggregation packet obviously MUST fit into an 
   IP packet, and the size SHOULD be chosen such that the resulting IP 
   packet is smaller than the MTU size.  An aggregation packet MUST 
   NOT contain fragmentation units specified in section 5.8. 
  
  
 5.7.1.       Single-Time Aggregation Packet 
  
   Single-time aggregation packet (STAP) SHOULD be used whenever 
   aggregating NAL units that share the same NALU-time.  The payload 
   of an STAP-A does not include DON and consists of at least one 
   single-time aggregation unit as presented in Figure 4.  The payload 
   of an STAP-B consists of a 16-bit unsigned decoding order number 
   (DON) followed by at least one single-time aggregation unit as 
   presented in Figure 5.

   A single-time aggregation unit consists of 16-bit unsigned size 
   information that indicates the size of the following NAL unit in 
   bytes (excluding these two octets, but including the NAL unit type 
   octet of the NAL unit), followed by the NAL unit itself including 
   its NAL unit type byte.  A single-time aggregation unit is byte-
   aligned within the RTP payload but it may not be aligned on a 32-
   bit word boundary.  Figure 6 presents the structure of the single-
   time aggregation unit.

 5.7.2.       Multi-Time Aggregation Packets (MTAPs) 
    
   The NAL unit payload of MTAPs consists of a 16-bit unsigned 
   decoding order number base (DONB) and one or more multi-time 
   aggregation units as presented in Figure 8.  DONB MUST contain the 
   value of DON for the first NAL unit in the NAL unit decoding order 
   among the NAL units of the MTAP.   
    
   Informative note: The first NAL unit in the NAL unit decoding order 
   is not necessarily the first NAL unit in the order the NAL units 
   are encapsulated in an MTAP. 
    
   The choice between the different MTAP types (MTAP16 and MTAP24) is 
   application dependent -- the larger the timestamp offset is, the 
   higher is the flexibility of the MTAP, but the higher is also the 
   overhead.

   Figure 8. NAL unit payload format for MTAPs. 
    
   Two different multi-time aggregation units are defined in this 
   specification.  Both of them consist of 16 bits unsigned size 
   information of the following NAL unit, an 8-bit unsigned decoding 
   order number delta (DOND), and n bits of timestamp offset (TS 
   offset) for this NAL unit, whereby n can be 16 or 24.  The 
   structure of the multi-time aggregation units for MTAP16 and MTAP24 
   are presented in Figure 9 and Figure 10 respectively.  Note that 
   the starting or ending position of an aggregation unit within a 
   packet is NOT REQUIRED to be on a 32-bit word boundary.  DON of the 
   following NAL unit is equal to (DONB + DOND) % 65536, in which % 
   denotes the modulo operation.  This memo does not specify how the 
   NAL units within an MTAP are ordered, but, in most cases, NAL unit 
   decoding order SHOULD be used.  The timestamp offset field MUST be 
   set to a value equal to the value of the following formula: (the 
   NALU-time of the NAL unit - the RTP timestamp of the packet).

   For the "earliest" multi-time aggregation unit in an MTAP the 
   timing offset MUST be zero.  Hence, the RTP timestamp of the MTAP 
   itself is identical to the earliest NALU-time. 
    
   Informative note: The "earliest" multi-time aggregation unit is 
   such that has the smallest RTP timestamp among all the aggregation 
   units of an MTAP if the aggregation units were encapsulated in 
   single NAL unit packets.  Such an "earliest" aggregation unit may 
   not be the first one in the order the aggregation units are 
   encapsulated in an MTAP.  The "earliest" NAL unit need not be the 
   same as the first NAL unit in the NAL unit decoding order either.

 5.8.     Fragmentation Units (FUs) 
    
   This payload type allows fragmenting a NAL unit into several RTP 
   packets.  Doing so on the application layer instead of relying on 
   lower layer fragmentation (e.g. by IP) has the following 
   advantages:

   o The payload format is capable of transporting NAL units bigger 
     than 64 kbytes over an IPv4 network that may be present in pre-
     recorded video, particularly in High Definition formats (there is 
     a limit of the number of slices per picture, which results in a 
     limit of NAL units per picture, which may result in big NAL 
     units) 
   o The fragmentation mechanism allows fragmenting a single picture 
     and applying generic forward error correction as described in 
     section 10.5. 
    
   Fragmentation is defined only for a single NAL unit, and not for 
   any aggregation packets.  A fragment of a NAL unit consists of an 
   integer number of consecutive octets of that NAL unit.  Each octet 
   of the NAL unit MUST be part of exactly one fragment of that NAL 
   unit.  Fragments of the same NAL unit MUST be sent in consecutive 
   order with ascending RTP sequence numbers (with no other RTP 
   packets within the same RTP packet stream being sent between the 
   first and last fragment).  Similarly, a NAL unit MUST be 
   reassembled in RTP sequence number order. 
    
   When a NAL unit is fragmented and conveyed within fragmentation 
   units (FUs), it is referred to as fragmented NAL unit.  STAPs and 
   MTAPs MUST NOT be fragmented.  FUs MUST NOT be nested, i.e., an FU 
   MUST NOT contain another FU. 
  
   The RTP timestamp of an RTP packet carrying an FU is set to the 
   NALU time of the fragmented NAL unit.   
    
   Figure 12 presents the RTP payload format for FU-As.  An FU-A 
   consists of a fragmentation unit indicator of one octet, a 
   fragmentation unit header of one octet, and a fragmentation unit 
   payload.

   The value of DON in FU-Bs is selected as described in section 5.5.   
    
   Informative note: The DON field in FU-Bs allows gateways to 
   fragment NAL units to FU-Bs without organizing the incoming NAL 
   units to the NAL unit decoding order.  
    
   A fragmented NAL unit MUST NOT be transmitted in one FU, i.e., 
   Start bit and End bit MUST NOT both be set to one in the same FU 
   header.   
    
   The FU payload consists of fragments of the payload of the 
   fragmented NAL unit such that if the fragmentation unit payloads of 
   consecutive FUs are sequentially concatenated, the payload of the 
   fragmented NAL unit is reconstructed.  Note that the NAL unit type 
   octet of the fragmented NAL unit is not included as such in the 
   fragmentation unit payload, but rather the information of the NAL 
   unit type octet of the fragmented NAL unit is conveyed in F and NRI 
   fields of the FU indicator octet of the fragmentation unit and in 
   the type field of the FU header.  A FU payload MAY have any number 
   of octets and MAY be empty. 
    
   If a fragmentation unit is lost, the receiver SHOULD discard all 
   following fragmentation units in transmission order corresponding 
   to the same fragmented NAL unit. 
  
  
 6.    Packetization Rules 
  
   The packetization modes are introduced in section 5.2.  The 
   packetization rules that are common to more than one of the 
   packetization modes are specified in section 6.1.  The 
   packetization rules for the single NAL unit mode, the non-
   interleaved mode, and the interleaved mode are specified in 
   sections 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4 respectively.

   All senders MUST enforce the following packetization rules 
   regardless of the packetization mode in use: 
    
   o Coded slice NAL units or coded slice data partition NAL units 
     belonging to the same coded picture (and hence sharing the same 
     RTP timestamp value) MAY be sent in any order permitted by the 
     applicable profile defined in [1], although, for delay-critical 
     systems, they SHOULD be sent in their original coding order to 
     minimize the delay.  Note that the coding order is not 
     necessarily the scan order, but the order the NAL packets become 
     available to the RTP stack.  
    
   o Sequence and picture parameter set NAL units MUST NOT be sent in 
     an RTP session whose parameter sets were already changed by 
     control protocol messages during the lifetime of the RTP session. 
    
   o Network elements such as gateways MUST NOT duplicate any NAL unit 
     except for sequence or picture parameter set NAL units, because 
     neither this memo nor the H.264 specification provides means to 
     identify duplicated NAL units.  Sequence and picture parameter 
     set NAL units MAY be duplicated to make their correct reception 
     more probable, but any such duplication MUST NOT affect the 
     contents of any active sequence or picture parameter set. 
    
   Senders according to the non-interleaved mode and the interleaved 
   mode MUST enforce the following packetization rule: 
    
   o Network elements such as gateways MAY convert single NAL unit 
     packets into one aggregation packet, convert an aggregation 
     packet into several single NAL unit packets, or mix both 
     concepts.  However, when doing so they SHOULD take into account 
     at least the following parameters: path MTU size, unequal 
     protection mechanisms (e.g. through packet-based FEC according to 
     RFC 2733 [21], carried by RFC 2198 [20], especially for sequence 
     and picture parameter set NAL units and coded slice data 
     partition A NAL units), bearable latency of the system, and 
     buffering capabilities of the receiver.

 6.2.     Single NAL Unit Mode 
  
   This mode is in use when the value of the optional packetization-
   mode MIME parameter is equal to 0 or packetization-mode is not 
   present or no other packetization mode is signaled by external 
   means.  All receivers MUST support this mode.  It is primarily 
   intended for low-delay applications that are compatible with 
   systems using ITU-T Recommendation H.241 [16] (see section 10.1).  
   Only single NAL unit packets MAY be used in this mode.  STAPs, 
   MTAPs, and FUs MUST NOT be used.  The transmission order of single 
   NAL unit packets MUST comply with the NAL unit decoding order.  
    
  
 6.3.     Non-Interleaved Mode  
    
   This mode is in use when the value of the optional packetization-
   mode MIME parameter is equal to 1 or the mode is turned on by 
   external means.  This mode SHOULD be supported.  It is primarily 
   intended for low-delay applications.  Only single NAL unit packets, 
   STAP-As and FU-As MAY be used in this mode.  STAP-Bs, MTAPs, and 
   FU-Bs MUST NOT be used.  The transmission order of NAL units MUST 
   comply with the NAL unit decoding order.  
    
    
 6.4.     Interleaved Mode 
  
   This mode is in use when the value of the optional packetization-
   mode MIME parameter is equal to 2 or the mode is turned on by 
   external means.  Some receivers MAY support this mode.  STAP-Bs, 
   MTAPs, FU-As, and FU-Bs MAY be used.  STAP-As and single NAL unit 
   packets MUST NOT be used.  The transmission order of packets and 
   NAL units is constrained as specified in section 5.5. 
    
    
 7.    De-Packetization Process (Informative) 
  
   The de-packetization process is implementation dependent.  Hence, 
   the following description should be seen as an example of a 
   suitable implementation.  Other schemes may be used as well.  
   Optimizations relative to the described algorithms are likely 
   possible.  Section 7.1 presents the de-packetization process for

   the single NAL unit and non-interleaved packetization modes, 
   whereas section 7.2 describes the process for the interleaved mode.  
   Section 7.3 includes additional decapsulation guidelines for 
   intelligent receivers. 
    
    
 7.1.     Single NAL Unit and Non-Interleaved Mode 
  
   The receiver includes a receiver buffer to compensate transmission 
   delay jitter.  The receiver stores incoming packets in reception 
   order into the receiver buffer.  Packets are decapsulated in RTP 
   sequence number order.  If a decapsulated packet is a single NAL 
   unit packet, the NAL unit contained in the packet is passed to the 
   decoder immediately after decapsulation.  If a decapsulated packet 
   is an STAP-A, the NAL units contained in the packet are passed to 
   the decoder in the order they are encapsulated in the packet 
   immediately after decapsulation.  If a decapsulated packet is an 
   FU-A, all the fragments of the fragmented NAL unit are concatenated 
   and passed to the decoder.  Note: If the decoder supports Arbitrary 
   Slice Order, coded slices of a picture can be passed to the decoder 
   in any order regardless of their reception and transmission order. 
    
    
 7.2.     Interleaved Mode 
  
   The general concept behind these de-packetization rules is to 
   reorder NAL units from transmission order to the NAL unit decoding 
   order.   
    
   The receiver includes a receiver buffer, which is used to reorder 
   packets from transmission order to the NAL unit decoding order.  
   The receiver may use the following guidelines when determining the 
   size of the receiver buffer.  The optional interleaving-depth MIME 
   parameter indicates the size of the receiver buffer as the number 
   of VCL NAL units.  The size of the receiver buffer in bytes may be 
   estimated by multiplying the optional init-buf-time MIME parameter 
   with the bandwidth-value of the corresponding media level SDP 
   description parameter, if available (and taking into account the 
   necessary conversions between the units of init-buf-time and 
   bandwidth-value).  The receiver should also take buffering for

 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
   transmission delay jitter into account and either reserve a 
   separate buffer for transmission delay jitter buffering or combine 
   the buffer for transmission delay jitter with the receiver buffer. 
    
   The receiver stores incoming NAL units in reception order into the 
   receiver buffer as follows.  NAL units of aggregation packets are 
   stored into the receiver buffer individually.  The value of DON is 
   calculated and stored for all NAL units. 
    
   Hereinafter, let N be the value of the optional interleaving-depth 
   MIME type parameter (see section 8.1) incremented by 1.  
   Furthermore, let function AbsDON be the same as specified in 
   section 8.1 and function don_diff(m,n) be specified as follows: 
    
   If DON(m) == DON(n), don_diff(m,n) = 0 
    
   If (DON(m) < DON(n) and DON(n) - DON(m) < 32768),  
   don_diff(m,n) = DON(n) - DON(m) 
    
   If (DON(m) > DON(n) and DON(m) - DON(n) >= 32768),  
   don_diff(m,n) = 65536 - DON(m) + DON(n) 
    
   If (DON(m) < DON(n) and DON(n) - DON(m) >= 32768), 
   don_diff(m,n) = - (DON(m) + 65536 - DON(n))  
    
   If (DON(m) > DON(n) and DON(m) - DON(n) < 32768),  
   don_diff(m,n) = - (DON(m) - DON(n)) 
    
   where DON(i) is the decoding order number of the NAL unit having 
   index i in the transmission order.  The decoding order number is 
   specified in section 5.5 of this RTP payload specification. 
    
   A positive value of don_diff(m,n) indicates that the NAL unit 
   having transmission order index n follows, in decoding order, the 
   NAL unit having transmission order index m. 
    
   There are two buffering states in the receiver: initial buffering 
   and buffering while playing.  Initial buffering occurs when the RTP 
   session is initialized.  After initial buffering, decoding and 
   playback is started and the buffering-while-playing mode is used.

 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
    
   Initial buffering lasts until one of the following conditions is 
   fulfilled:  
   o There are N VCL NAL units in the receiver buffer. 
   o If max-don-diff is present, don_diff(m,n) is greater than the 
     value of max-don-diff, in which n corresponds to the NAL unit 
     having the greatest value of AbsDON among the received NAL units 
     and m corresponds to the NAL unit having the smallest value of 
     AbsDON among the received NAL units. 
   o Initial buffering has lasted for the duration equal to or greater 
     than the value of the optional init-buf-time MIME parameter. 
    
   The NAL units to be removed from the receiver buffer are determined 
   as follows: 
   o If the receiver buffer contains at least N VCL NAL units, NAL 
     units are removed from the receiver buffer and passed to the 
     decoder in the order specified below until the buffer contains N-
     1 VCL NAL units.   
   o If max-don-diff is present, all NAL units m for which 
     don_diff(m,n) is greater than max-don-diff are removed from the 
     receiver buffer and passed to the decoder in the order specified 
     below.  Herein, n corresponds to the NAL unit having the greatest 
     value of AbsDON among the received NAL units. 
   o Variable ts is set to the value of system timer that was 
     initialized to 0 when the first packet of the NAL unit stream was 
     received.  If the receiver buffer contains a NAL unit whose 
     reception time tr fulfills the condition that ts - tr > init-buf-
     time, NAL units are passed to the decoder (and removed from the 
     receiver buffer) in the order specified below until the receiver 
     buffer contains no NAL unit whose reception time tr fulfills the 
     specified condition.  Note that transmission delay jitter should 
     be taken into account in the calculations with timestamps. 
    
   The order that NAL units are passed to the decoder is specified as 
   follows: 
    
   o Let PDON be a variable that is initialized to 0 at the beginning 
     of the an RTP session.

   o For each NAL unit associated with a value of DON, a DON distance 
     is calculated as follows.  If the value of DON of the NAL unit is 
     larger than the value of PDON, the DON distance is equal to DON - 
     PDON.  Otherwise, the DON distance is equal to 65535 - PDON + DON 
     + 1.   
    
   o NAL units are delivered to the decoder in ascending order of DON 
     distance.  If several NAL units share the same value of DON 
     distance, they can be passed to the decoder in any order. 
    
   o When a desired number of NAL units have been passed to the 
     decoder, the value of PDON is set to the value of DON for the 
     last NAL unit passed to the decoder.   
    
    
 7.3.     Additional De-Packetization Guidelines 
    
   The following additional de-packetization rules may be used to 
   implement an operational H.264 de-packetizer: 
    
   o Intelligent RTP receivers (e.g. in gateways) may identify lost 
     coded slice data partitions A (DPAs).  If a lost DPA is found, a 
     gateway may decide not to send the corresponding coded slice data 
     partitions B and C, as their information is meaningless for H.264 
     decoders.  In this way a network element can reduce network load 
     by discarding useless packets, without parsing a complex 
     bitstream. 
    
   o Intelligent RTP receivers (e.g. in gateways) may identify lost 
     FUs.  If a lost FU is found, a gateway may decide not to send the 
     following FUs of the same NAL unit, as their information is 
     meaningless for H.264 decoders.  In this way a network element 
     can reduce network load by discarding useless packets, without 
     parsing a complex bitstream. 
    
   o Intelligent receivers may discard all packets in which the value 
     of the NRI field of the NAL unit type octet is equal to 0.  
     However, they process those packets if possible, because the user 
     experience may suffer if the packets are discarded.

 8.    Payload Format Parameters 
  
   This section specifies the parameters that MAY be used to select 
   optional features of the payload format.  The parameters are 
   specified here as part of the MIME subtype registration for the 
   ITU-T H.264 | ISO/IEC 14496-10 codec.  A mapping of the parameters 
   into the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [5] is also provided 
   for those applications that use SDP.  Equivalent parameters could 
   be defined elsewhere for use with control protocols that do not use 
   MIME or SDP.

                     specified in the future by ITU-T or ISO/IEC.  
                     If the profile-level-id parameter is used for 
                     indicating properties of a NAL unit stream, it 
                     indicates the profiles that are in use in the 
                     stream and the highest level that is in use 
                     for each signaled profile.  The profile-iop 
                     byte for each signaled profile indicates 
                     whether the NAL unit stream also obeys all 
                     constraints of the indicated profiles as 
                     follows.  If bit 7 (the most significant bit), 
                     bit 6, or bit 5 of profile-iop is equal to 1, 
                     all constraints of the Baseline profile, the 
                     Main profile, or the Extended profile, 
                     respectively, are obeyed in the NAL unit 
                     stream.  If the profile-level-id parameter is 
                     used for capability exchange or session setup 
                     procedure, it indicates the profiles that the 
                     codec supports and the highest level that is 
                     supported for each signaled profile.  The 
                     profile-iop byte for each signaled profile 
                     indicates whether the codec has such 
                     additional limitations that only the common 
                     subset of the algorithmic features and 
                     limitations of the profiles signaled with the 
                     profile-iop byte and the profile indicated by 
                     profile_idc is supported by the codec.  For 
                     example, if a codec supports the Baseline 
                     Profile at level 3 and below and the Main 
                     Profile at level 2.1 and below without any 
                     additional limitations, the profile-level-id 
                     becomes 42A01E4D4015.  If a codec supports 
                     only the common subset of the coding tools of 
                     the Baseline profile and the Main profile at 
                     level 2.1 and below, the profile-level-id 
                     becomes 42E015.  If no profile-level-id is 
                     present, the Baseline Profile without 
                     additional constraints at Level 1 MUST be 
                     implied.

                     sequence and picture parameter set NAL units, 
                     herein referred to as the initial parameter 
                     set NAL units, that MUST precede any other NAL

                     of the parameter is the base64 [6] 
                     representation of the initial parameter set

                     conveyed in decoding order and no framing of 
                     the parameter set NAL units takes place.  A 
                     comma is used to separate any pair of 
                     parameter sets in the list.  Note that the 
                     number of bytes in a parameter set NAL unit is 
                     typically less than 10 bytes, but a picture 
                     parameter set NAL unit can contain several 
                     hundreds of bytes.

                     present in the stream, but STAPs, MTAPs, and 
                     FUs MUST NOT be present in the stream.  This

                     Recommendation H.241 [16] (see section 10.1).  
                     When the value of packetization-mode is equal

      interleaving-depth: This parameter MUST NOT be present when 
                     packetization-mode is not present or the value 
                     of packetization-mode is equal to 0 or 1.  
                     This parameter MUST be present when the value 
                     of packetization-mode is equal to 2.   
       
                     This parameter signals the properties of a NAL 
                     unit stream or the capabilities of a receiver 
                     implementation.  When the parameter is used to 
                     signal the properties of a NAL unit stream, it 
                     specifies the maximum number of VCL NAL units 
                     that precede any VCL NAL unit in the NAL unit 
                     stream in transmission order and follow the 
                     VCL NAL unit in decoding order.  Consequently, 
                     it is guaranteed that receivers can 
                     reconstruct NAL unit decoding order, when the 
                     buffer size for NAL unit decoding order 
                     recovery is at least the value of 
                     interleaving-depth + 1 in terms of VCL NAL 
                     units.  When the parameter is used to signal 
                     the capabilities of a receiver implementation, 
                     the receiver is able to correctly reconstruct 
                     the NAL unit decoding order of NAL unit 
                     streams that are characterized by the same 
                     value of interleaving-depth.  When the 
                     receiver buffers such number of VCL NAL units 
                     that equals to or is greater than the value of 
                     interleaving-depth, it is able to reconstruct 
                     NAL unit decoding order from the transmission 
                     order. 
                      
                     If the parameter is not present, then a value 
                     of 0 MUST be used for interleaving-depth.  The 
                     value of interleaving-depth MUST be an integer 
                     in the range of 0 to 32767, inclusive. 
 
      init-buf-time:    This parameter MAY be used to signal the

                     When the parameter is used to signal the 
                     properties of a NAL unit steam, it signals the 
                     initial buffering time that a receiver MUST 
                     buffer before starting decoding to recover the 
                     NAL unit decoding order from the transmission 
                     order.  The parameter is the maximum value of 
                     (transmission time of a NAL unit - decoding 
                     time of the NAL unit) assuming reliable and 
                     instantaneous transmission, the same timeline 
                     for transmission and decoding, and starting of 
                     decoding when the first packet arrives.   
                      
                     An example of specifying the value of init-
                     buf-time follows: A NAL unit stream is sent in 
                     the following interleaved order, in which the 
                     value corresponds to the decoding time and the 
                     transmission order is from left to right: 
                      
                     0  2  1  3  5  4  6  8  7 ... 
                      
                     Assuming a steady transmission rate of NAL 
                     units, the transmission times are: 
                     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 ... 
                      
                     Subtracting the decoding time from the 
                     transmission time column-wise results into the 
                     following series: 
                     0 -1  1  0 -1  1  0 -1 1 ... 
                      
                     Thus, the value of init-buf-time in this 
                     example is 1 in terms of intervals of NAL unit 
                     transmission times. 
                      
                     When the parameter is used to signal the 
                     capabilities of a receiver implementation, it 
                     signals the duration of initial buffering that 
                     the receiver is capable of handling in any 
                     circumstances.

                     representation in clock ticks of a 90-kHz 
                     clock.  If the parameter is not present, then 
                     a value of 0 MUST be used for init-buf-time.  
                     The value of initial-init-buf-time MUST be an

                     receiver or codec capabilities.  The parameter 
                     MUST NOT be present, if the value of 
                     packetization-mode is equal to 0 or 1.  max-
                     don-diff is an integer in the range of 0 to 
                     32767, inclusive.  If max-don-diff is not 
                     present, the value of the parameter is 
                     unspecified.  max-don-diff is calculated as 
                     follows: 
       
                     max-don-diff = max{AbsDON(i) - AbsDON(j)},  
                     for any i and any j>i, 
       
                     where i and j indicate the index of the NAL 
                     unit in the transmission order and AbsDON 
                     denotes such decoding order number of the NAL 
                     unit that does not wrap around to 0 after 
                     65535.  In other words, AbsDON is calculated 
                     as follows: Let m and n are consecutive NAL 
                     units in transmission order.  For the very 
                     first NAL unit in transmission order (whose 
                     index is 0), AbsDON(0) = DON(0).  For other 
                     NAL units, AbsDON is calculated as follows:

 8.2.     SDP Parameters 
    
   The MIME media type video/H264 string is mapped to fields in the 
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [5] as follows: 
    
   o The media name in the "m=" line of SDP MUST be video. 
    
   o The encoding name in the "a=rtpmap" line of SDP MUST be H264 (the 
     MIME subtype). 
    
   o The clock rate in the "a=rtpmap" line MUST be 90000. 
    
   o The optional parameters "profile-level-id", "parameter-sets", 
     "packetization-mode", "interleaving-depth", "init-buf-time", and 
     "max-don-diff", if any, SHALL be included in the "a=fmtp" line of 
     SDP.  These parameters are expressed as a MIME media type string, 
     in the form of as a semicolon separated list of parameter=value 
     pairs.

   An example of media representation in SDP is as follows (Baseline 
   Profile, Level 3.0, more than one slice group, arbitrary slice 
   ordering, and redundant slices are in use): 
    
   m=video 49170/2 RTP/AVP 98

   a=fmtp:98 profile-level-id=42A01E 
    
    
 9.    Security Considerations 
  
   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification 
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP 
   specification [4], and any appropriate RTP profile (for example 
   [17]).  This implies that confidentiality of the media streams is 
   achieved by encryption.  Because the data compression used with 
   this payload format is applied end-to-end, encryption may be 
   performed after compression so there is no conflict between the two 
   operations.  
    
   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encodings 
   using compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end 
   computational load.  The attacker can inject such pathological 
   datagrams into the stream that are complex to decode and cause the 
   receiver to be overloaded.  H.264 is particularly vulnerable to 
   such attacks because it is extremely simple to generate datagrams 
   containing NAL units that affect the decoding process of many 
   future NAL units. 
    
   As with any IP-based protocol, in some circumstances a receiver may 
   be overloaded simply by the receipt of too many packets, either 
   desired or undesired.  Network-layer authentication may be used to 
   discard packets from undesired sources, but the processing cost of 
   the authentication itself may be too high.  In a multicast 
   environment, pruning of specific sources may be implemented in 
   future versions of IGMP [18] and in multicast routing protocols to 
   allow a receiver to select which sources are allowed to reach it.

   Decoders MUST exercise caution with respect to the handling of user 
   data SEI messages, particularly if they contain active elements, 
   and MUST restrict their domain of applicability to the presentation 
   containing the stream. 
    
    
 10.     Informative Appendix: Application Examples 
  
   This payload specification is very flexible in its use, to cover 
   the extremely wide application space that is anticipated for the 
   H.264.  However, such a great flexibility also makes it difficult 
   for an implementer to decide on a reasonable packetization scheme.  
   Some information how to apply this specification to real-world 
   scenarios is likely to appear in the form of academic publications 
   and a test model software and description in the near future.  
   However, some preliminary usage scenarios are described here as 
   well.   
    
    
 10.1.      Video Telephony according to ITU-T Recommendation H.241  
      Annex A 
    
   H.323-based video telephony systems that use H.264 as an optional 
   video compression scheme are required to support H.241 Annex A [16] 
   as a packetization scheme.  The packetization mechanism defined in 
   this Annex is technically identical with a small subset of this 
   specification. 
   When operating according to H.241 Annex A, parameter sets NAL units 
   are sent in-band.  Only Single NAL unit packets are used.  A 
   typical packet stream generated by such a system consists of all 
   sequence and picture parameter sets used for the future video 
   sequence, possibly sent in more than one copy to raise the 
   likeliness of their arrival at the receiver, followed by the 
   packets carrying the NAL units of the IDR picture, and followed by 
   packets carrying the subsequent pictures.  Many such systems are 
   not sending IDR pictures regularly, but only when required by user 
   interaction or by control protocol means, e.g. when switching 
   between video channels in an Multipoint Control Unit.

 10.2.      Video Telephony, No Slice Data Partitioning, No NAL Unit  
      Aggregation 
  
   The RTP part of this scheme is implemented and tested (though not 
   the control-protocol part, see below). 
    
   In most real-world video telephony applications, the picture 
   parameters such as picture size or optional modes never change 
   during the lifetime of a connection.  Hence, all necessary 
   parameter sets (usually only one) are sent as a side effect of the 
   capability exchange/announcement process e.g. according to the SDP 
   syntax specified in section 8.2 of this document.  Since all 
   necessary parameter set information is established before the RTP 
   session starts, there is no need for sending any parameter set NAL 
   units.  Slice data partitioning is not used either.  Hence, the RTP 
   packet stream consists basically of NAL units that carry single 
   coded slices. 
    
   The encoder chooses the size of coded slice NAL units such that 
   they offer the best performance.  Often, this is done by adapting 
   the coded slice size to the MTU size of the IP network.  For small 
   picture sizes this may result in a one-picture-per-one-packet 
   strategy.  Intra refresh algorithms clean up the loss of packets 
   and the resulting drift-related artifacts. 
    
    
 10.3.      Video Telephony, Interleaved Packetization Using NAL Unit 
      Aggregation 
  
   This scheme allows better error concealment and is widely used in 
   H.263 based designed using RFC 2429 packetization [11].  It is also 
   implemented and good results were reported [13].  
    
   The VCL encoder codes the source picture such that all macroblocks 
   (MBs) of one MB line are assigned to one slice.  All slices with 
   even MB row addresses are combined into one STAP, and all slices 
   with odd MB row addresses into another STAP.  Those STAPs are 
   transmitted as RTP packets.  The establishment of the parameter 
   sets is performed as discussed above. 
    
 Wenger et. al.    Expires December 2003             [Page 50] 

 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
   Note that the use of STAPs is essential here, because the high 
   number of individual slices (18 for a CIF picture) would lead to 
   unacceptably high IP/UDP/RTP header overhead (unless the source 
   coding tool FMO is used, which is not assumed in this scenario).  
   Furthermore, some wireless video transmission systems, such as 
   H.324M and the IP-based video telephony specified in 3GPP, are 
   likely to use relatively small transport packet size.  For example, 
   a typical MTU size of H.223 AL3 SDU is around 100 bytes [19].  
   Coding individual slices according to this packetization scheme 
   provides a further advantage in communication between wired and 
   wireless networks, as individual slices are likely to be smaller 
   than the preferred maximum packet size of wireless systems.  
   Consequently, a gateway can convert the STAPs used in a wired 
   network to several RTP packets with only one NAL unit that are 
   preferred in a wireless network and vice versa.  
    
    
 10.4.      Video Telephony, with Data Partitioning 
  
   This scheme is implemented and was shown to offer good performance 
   especially at higher packet loss rates [13]. 
    
   Data Partitioning is known to be useful only when some form of 
   unequal error protection is available.  Normally, in single-session 
   RTP environments, even error characteristics are assumed, i.e., the 
   packet loss probability of all packets of the session is the same 
   statistically.  However, there are means to reduce the packet loss 
   probability of individual packets in an RTP session.  RFC 2198 
   [20], for example, allows carrying a redundant copy of an essential 
   packet in the next RTP packet.  Packet-based Forward Error 
   Correction [21] carried in RFC 2198 is also an appropriate means to 
   protect high priority information. 
    
   In all cases, the incurred overhead is substantial, but in the same 
   order of magnitude as the number of bits that have otherwise be 
   spent for intra information.  However, this mechanism is not adding 
   any delay to the system.   
    
   Again, the complete parameter set establishment is performed 
   through control protocol means.

 10.5.      Video Telephony or Streaming, with FUs and Forward Error 
 Correction 
    
   This scheme is implemented and was shown to provide good 
   performance especially at higher packet loss rates [22]. 
    
   The most efficient means to combat packet-losses for scenarios 
   where retransmissions are not applicable is forward error 
   correction (FEC).  Although end-to-end solutions are usually not 
   preferable, they are unavoidable in some scenarios.  For example, 
   RFC2733 [21] provides means to use generic FEC in packet-loss 
   environments.  A binary forward error correcting code is generated 
   by applying the XOR operation to the bits at the same bit position 
   in different packets.  The binary code can be specified by the 
   parameters (n,k) in which k is the number of information packets 
   used in the connection and n is the total number of packets 
   generated for k information packets, i.e., n-k parity packets are 
   generated for k information packets. 
    
   When using a code with parameters (n,k) within the RFC2733 
   framework, the following properties are well-known: 
   a) RFC2733 can only be applied over a sequence of RTP packets, not 
      over one RTP packet. 
   b) RFC2733 is most bit-rate efficient if XOR-connected packets have 
      equal length.  
   c) At the same packet loss probability p and for a fixed k, the 
      greater the value of n is, the smaller the residual error 
      probability becomes.  For example, for packet loss probability 
      10%, k=1, and n=2, the residual error probability is about 1%, 
      whereas for n=3, the residual error probability is about 0.1%. 
   d) At the same packet loss probability p and for a fixed code rate 
      k/n, the greater the value of n is, the smaller the residual 
      error probability becomes.  For example, at a packet loss 
      probability of p=10%, k=1 and n=2, the residual error rate is 
      about 1%, whereas for an extended Golay code with k=12 and n=24, 
      the residual error rate is about 0.01%.

   For applying RFC2733 in combination with H.264 baseline coded video 
   without using FUs several options might be considered: 
   1) The video encoder produces NAL units where each video frame is 
      coded in a single slice.  Applying FEC, one could use a simple 
      code, e.g. (n=2, k=1), i.e., each NAL unit would basically just 
      be repeated.  The disadvantage is obviously the bad code 
      performance according to (d) and the low flexibility as only (n, 
      k=1) codes can be used. 
   2) The video encoder produces NAL units where each video frame is 
      encoded in a single slice.  Applying FEC, one could use a better 
      code, e.g. (n=24, k=12), over a sequence of NAL units.  The 
      disadvantage is obviously that in case of losses a significant 
      delay is introduced and packets of completely different length 
      might be connected, which decreases bit-rate efficiency 
      according to (b) 
   3) The video encoder produces NAL units, where a certain frame 
      contains k slices of possibly almost equal length.  Then, 
      applying FEC, a better code, e.g. (n=24, k=12), over the 
      sequence of NAL units for each frame can be used.  The delay 
      compared to (2) is reduced, but several disadvantages are 
      obvious.  Firstly, the coding efficiency of the encoded video is 
      lowered significantly as slice-structured coding reduces intra-
      frame prediction and additional slice overhead is necessary.  
      Secondly, pre-encoded content or, when operating over a gateway, 
      the video is usually not appropriately coded with k slices such 
      that FEC can be applied.  Finally, the encoding of video 
      producing k slices of equal length is not straightforward and 
      might require more than one encoding pass. 
    
   Many of the mentioned disadvantages can be avoided by applying FUs 
   in combination with FEC.  Each NAL unit can be split into any 
   number of FUs of basically equal length, and therefore FEC with a 
   reasonable k and n can be applied even if the encoder made no 
   effort of producing slices of equal length.  For example, a coded 
   slice NAL unit containing an entire frame can be split to k FUs and 
   a parity check code (n=k+1, k) can be applied.   
    
   The presented technique makes it possible to achieve good 
   transmission error tolerance even if no additional source coding 
   layer redundancy, such as periodic intra frames, is present.  
 Wenger et. al.    Expires December 2003             [Page 53] 

 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
   Consequently, the same coded video sequence can be used for 
   achieving the maximum compression efficiency and quality over 
   error-free transmission and for transmission over error-prone 
   networks.  Furthermore, the technique allows the application of FEC 
   to pre-encoded sequences without adding delay.  In addition, in 
   this case pre-encoded sequences that are not encoded for error-
   prone networks can still be transmitted almost reliably without 
   adding extensive delays.  In addition, FUs of equal length result 
   in a bit-rate efficient use of RFC2733.  
    
   In case that the error probability depends on the length of the 
   transmitted packet, e.g. in case of mobile transmission [15], the 
   benefits of applying FUs with FEC are even more obvious.  
   Basically, the flexibility of the size of FUs allows applying 
   appropriate FEC for each NAL unit and even unequal error protection 
   of NAL units. 
    
   The incurred overhead when using FUs and FEC is substantial, but in 
   the same order of magnitude as the number of bits that have to be 
   spent for intra coded macroblocks if no FEC is applied.  In [22] it 
   was shown that the overall performance at the same error rate and 
   the same overall bit-rate including the overhead, the FEC-based 
   approach can enhance the quality.   
    
    
 10.6.      Low-Bit-Rate Streaming 
  
   This scheme has been implemented with H.263 and non-standard RTP 
   packetization and gave good results [23].  There is no technical 
   reason why similarly good results could not be achievable with 
   H.264.  
    
   In today's Internet streaming, some of the offered bit-rates are 
   relatively low in order to allow terminals with dial-up modems to 
   access the content.  In wired IP networks, relatively large 
   packets, say 500 - 1500 bytes, are preferred to smaller and more 
   frequently occurring packets in order to reduce network congestion.  
   Moreover, use of large packets decreases the amount of RTP/UDP/IP 
   header overhead.  For low-bit-rate video, the use of large packets

 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
   means that sometimes up to few pictures should be encapsulated in 
   one packet.  
    
   However, loss of a packet including many coded pictures would have 
   drastic consequences in visual quality, as there is practically no 
   other way to conceal a loss of an entire picture than to repeat the 
   previous one.  One way to construct relatively large packets and 
   maintain possibilities for successful loss concealment is to 
   construct MTAPs that contain slices from several pictures in an 
   interleaved manner.  An MTAP should not contain spatially adjacent 
   slices from the same picture or spatially overlapping slices from 
   any picture.  If a packet is lost, it is likely that a lost slice 
   is surrounded by spatially adjacent slices of the same picture and 
   spatially corresponding slices of the temporally previous and 
   succeeding pictures.  Consequently, concealment of the lost slice 
   is likely to succeed relatively well. 
    
    
 10.7.      Robust Packet Scheduling in Video Streaming 
    
   This scheme has been implemented with MPEG-4 Part 2 and simulated 
   in a wireless streaming environment [24].  There is no technical 
   reason why similar or better results could not be achievable with 
   H.264. 
    
   Streaming clients typically have a receiver buffer that is capable 
   of storing a relatively large amount of data.  Initially, when a 
   streaming session is established, a client does not start playing 
   the stream back immediately, but rather it typically buffers the 
   incoming data for a few seconds.  This buffering helps to maintain 
   continuous playback, because, in case of occasional increased 
   transmission delays or network throughput drops, the client can 
   decode and play buffered data.  Otherwise, without initial 
   buffering, the client has to freeze the display, stop decoding, and 
   wait for incoming data.  The buffering is also necessary for either 
   automatic or selective retransmission in any protocol level.  If 
   any part of a picture is lost, a retransmission mechanism may be 
   used to resend the lost data.  If the retransmitted data is 
   received before its scheduled decoding or playback time, the loss 
   is perfectly recovered.  Coded pictures can be ranked according to 
 Wenger et. al.    Expires December 2003             [Page 55] 

 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
   their importance in the subjective quality of the decoded sequence.  
   For example, non-reference pictures, such as conventional B 
   pictures, are subjectively least important, because their absence 
   does not affect decoding of any other pictures.  In addition to 
   non-reference pictures, the ITU-T H.264 | ISO/IEC 14496-10 standard 
   includes a temporal scalability method called sub-sequences [25].  
   Subjective ranking can also be made on coded slice data partition 
   or slice group basis.  Coded slices and coded slice data partitions 
   that are subjectively the most important can be sent earlier than 
   their decoding order indicates, whereas coded slices and coded 
   slice data partitions that are subjectively the least important can 
   be sent later than their natural coding order indicates.  
   Consequently, any retransmitted parts of the most important slices 
   and coded slice data partitions are more likely to be received 
   before their scheduled decoding or playback time compared to the 
   least important slices and slice data partitions. 
    
    
 11.     Informative Appendix: Rationale for Decoding Order Number 
    
 11.1.      Introduction 
  
   The Decoding Order Number (DON) concept was introduced mainly to 
   enable efficient multi-picture slice interleaving (see section 
   10.6) and robust packet scheduling (see section 10.7).  In both of 
   these applications NAL units are transmitted out of decoding order.  
   DON indicates the decoding order of NAL units and should be used in 
   the receiver to recover the decoding order.  Example use cases for 
   efficient multi-picture slice interleaving and for robust packet 
   scheduling are given in sections 11.2 and 11.3 respectively.  
   Section 11.4 describes the benefits of the DON concept in error 
   resiliency achieved by redundant coded pictures.  Section 11.5 
   summarizes considered alternatives to DON and justifies why DON was 
   chosen to this RTP payload specification. 
    
    
 11.2.      Example of Multi-Picture Slice Interleaving 
  
   An example of multi-picture slice interleaving follows.  A subset 
   of a coded video sequence is depicted below in output order.  R

   denotes a reference picture, N denotes a non-reference picture, and 
   the number indicates a relative output time. 
    
   ... R1 N2 R3 N4 R5 ... 
    
   The decoding order of these pictures is from left to right as 
   follows: 
   ... R1 R3 N2 R5 N4 ... 
    
   The NAL units of pictures R1, R3, N2, R5, and N4 are marked with a 
   DON equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. 
    
   Each reference picture consists of three slice groups that are 
   scattered as follows (a number denotes the slice group number for 
   each macroblock in a QCIF frame): 
    
   0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 
   2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 
   1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 
   0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 
   2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 
   1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 
   0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 
   2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0

   For the sake of simplicity, we assume that all the macroblocks of a 
   slice group are included in one slice.  Three MTAPs are constructed 
   from three consecutive reference pictures so that each MTAP 
   contains three aggregation units, each of which contains all the 
   macroblocks from one slice group.  The first MTAP contains slice 
   group 0 of picture R1, slice group 1 of picture R2, and slice group 
   2 of picture R3.  The second MTAP contains slice group 1 of picture 
   R1, slice group 2 of picture R2, and slice group 0 of picture R3.  
   The third MTAP contains slice group 2 of picture R1, slice group 0 
   of picture R2, and slice group 1 of picture R3.  Each non-reference 
   picture is encapsulated into an STAP-B. 
    
   Consequently, the transmission order of NAL units is the following: 
     R1, slice group 0, DON 1, carried in MTAP,   RTP SN: N

     N4,                DON 5, carried in STAP-B, RTP SN: N+4 
    
   The receiver is able to organize the NAL units back in decoding 
   order based on the value of DON associated with each NAL unit. 
    
   If one the MTAPs is lost, the spatially adjacent and temporally co-
   located macroblocks are received and can be used to conceal the 
   loss efficiently.  If one of the STAPs is lost, the effect of the 
   loss does not propagate temporally. 
    
    
 11.3.      Example of Robust Packet Scheduling 
    
   An example of robust packet scheduling follows.  The communication 
   system used in the example consists of the following components in 
   the order that the video is processed from source to sink: 
   o camera and capturing 
   o pre-encoding buffer 
   o encoder 
   o encoded picture buffer 
   o transmitter 
   o transmission channel 
   o receiver 
   o receiver buffer 
   o decoder 
   o decoded picture buffer 
   o display 
    
   The video communication system used in the example operates as 
   follows.  Note that processing of the video stream happens 
   gradually and at the same time in all components of the system.

   The source video sequence is shot and captured to a pre-encoding 
   buffer.  The pre-encoding buffer can be used to order pictures from 
   sampling order to encoding order or to analyze multiple 
   uncompressed frames for bitrate rate control purposes, for  
   example.  In some cases the pre-encoding buffer may not exist, but 
   rather the sampled pictures are encoded right away.  The encoder 
   encodes pictures from the pre-encoding buffer and stores the 
   output, i.e., coded pictures, to the encoded picture buffer.  The 
   transmitter encapsulates the coded pictures from the encoded 
   picture buffer to transmission packets and sends them to a receiver 
   through a transmission channel.  The receiver stores the received 
   packets to the receiver buffer.  The receiver buffering process 
   typically includes buffering for transmission delay jitter.  The 
   receiver buffer can also be used to recover correct decoding order 
   of coded data.  The decoder reads coded data from the receiver 
   buffer and produces decoded pictures as output into the decoded 
   picture buffer.  The decoded picture buffer is used to recover the 
   output (or display) order of pictures.  Finally, pictures are 
   displayed. 
    
   In the following example figures, I denotes an IDR picture, R 
   denotes a reference picture, N denotes a non-reference picture, and 
   the number after I, R, or N indicates a relative sampling time 
   proportional to the previous IDR picture in decoding order.  Values 
   below the sequence of pictures indicate scaled system clock 
   timestamps.  The system clock is initialized arbitrarily in this 
   example, and time runs from left to right.  Each I, R, and N 
   picture is mapped into the same timeline compared to the previous 
   processing step, if any, assuming that encoding, transmission, and 
   decoding take no time.  Thus, events happening at the same time are 
   located in the same column throughout all example figures. 
    
   A subset of a sequence of coded pictures is depicted below in 
   sampling order.

   The sampled pictures are buffered in the pre-encoding buffer to 
   arrange them in encoding order.  In this example, we assume that 
   the non-reference pictures are predicted from both the previous and 
   the next reference picture in output order.  Thus, the pre-encoding 
   buffer has to contain at least two pictures and the buffering 
   causes a delay of two picture intervals.  The output of the pre-
   encoding buffering process and the encoding (and decoding) order of 
   the pictures are as follows: 
    
            ... N58 N59 I00 R03 N01 N02 R06 N04 N05 ...  
            ... -|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-  ...  
            ... 60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  ... 
    
   The encoder or the transmitter can set the value of DON for each 
   picture to a value of DON for the previous picture in decoding 
   order plus one. 
    
   For the sake of simplicity, let us assume that: 
   o the frame rate of the sequence is constant, 
   o each picture consists of only one slice, 
   o each slice is encapsulated in a single NAL unit packet, 
   o pictures are transmitted in decoding order, and 
   o pictures are transmitted at constant intervals (that is equal to 
   1 / frame rate). 
    
   Thus, pictures are received in decoding order: 
    
            ... N58 N59 I00 R03 N01 N02 R06 N04 N05 ...  
            ... -|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|- ...  
            ... 60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  ... 
    
   The optional interleaving-depth MIME type parameter is set to 0, 
   because the transmission (or reception) order is identical to the 
   decoding order. 
    
   The decoder has to buffer for one picture interval initially in its 
   decoded picture buffer to organize pictures from decoding order to 
   output order as depicted below: 
    
                ... N58 N59 I00 N01 N02 R03 N04 N05 R06 ...

                ... 61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  ... 
    
   The amount of required initial buffering in the decoded picture 
   buffer can be signaled in the buffering period SEI message or with 
   the num_reorder_frames syntax element of H.264 video usability 
   information.  num_reorder_frames indicates the maximum number of 
   frames, complementary field pairs, or non-paired fields that 
   precede any frame, complementary field pair, or non-paired field in 
   the sequence in decoding order and follow it in output order.  For 
   the sake of simplicity, we assume that num_reorder_frames is used 
   to indicate the initial buffer in the decoded picture buffer.  In 
   this example, num_reorder_frames is equal to 1. 
    
   It can be observed that if the IDR picture I00 is lost during 
   transmission and a retransmission request is issued when the value 
   of the system clock is 62, there is one picture interval of time 
   (until the system clock reaches timestamp 63) to receive the 
   retransmitted IDR picture I00. 
    
   Let us then assume that IDR pictures are transmitted two frame 
   intervals earlier than their decoding position, i.e., the pictures 
   are transmitted as follows: 
    
                   ...  I00 N58 N59 R03 N01 N02 R06 N04 N05 ...  
                   ... --|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|- ...  
                   ...  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  ...  
    
   The optional interleaving-depth MIME type parameter is set equal to 
   1 according to its definition.  (The value of interleaving-depth in 
   this example can be derived as follows:  Picture I00 is the only 
   picture preceding picture N58 or N59 in transmission order and 
   following it in decoding order.  Except for pictures I00, N58, and 
   N59, the transmission order is the same as the decoding order of 
   pictures.  Since a coded picture is encapsulated into exactly one 
   NAL unit, the value of interleaving-depth is equal to the maximum 
   number of pictures preceding any picture in transmission order and 
   following the picture in decoding order.)

   The receiver buffering process contains two pictures at a time 
   according to the value of the interleaving-depth parameter and 
   orders pictures from the reception order to the correct decoding 
   order based on the value of DON associated with each picture.  The 
   output of the receiver buffering process is the following: 
    
                        ... N58 N59 I00 R03 N01 N02 R06 N04 N05 ...  
                        ... -|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|- ...  
                        ... 63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  ... 
    
   Again, an initial buffering delay of one picture interval is needed 
   to organize pictures from decoding order to output order as 
   depicted below: 
    
                            ... N58 N59 I00 N01 N02 R03 N04 N05 ... 
                            ... -|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|- ... 
                            ... 64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  ... 
    
   It can be observed that the maximum delay that IDR pictures can 
   undergo during transmission, including possible application, 
   transport, or link layer retransmission, is equal to three picture 
   intervals.  Thus, the loss resiliency of IDR pictures is improved 
   in systems supporting retransmission compared to the case in which 
   pictures were transmitted in their decoding order. 
    
    
 11.4.      Robust Transmission Scheduling of Redundant Coded Slices 
    
   A redundant coded picture is a coded representation of a picture or 
   a part of a picture that is not used in the decoding process if the 
   corresponding primary coded picture is correctly decoded.  There 
   should be no noticeable difference between any area of the decoded 
   primary picture and a corresponding area that would result from 
   application of the H.264 decoding process for any redundant picture 
   in the same access unit.  A redundant coded slice is a coded slice 
   that is a part of a redundant coded picture. 
    
   Redundant coded pictures can be used to provide unequal error 
   protection in error-prone video transmission.  If a primary coded 
   representation of a picture is decoded incorrectly, a corresponding

 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
   redundant coded picture can be decoded.  Examples of applications 
   and coding techniques utilizing the redundant codec picture feature 
   include the video redundancy coding [26] and protection of "key 
   pictures" in multicast streaming [27]. 
    
   One property of many error-prone video communications systems is 
   that transmission errors are often bursty and therefore they may 
   affect more than one consecutive transmission packets in 
   transmission order.  In low bitrate video communication it is 
   relatively common that an entire coded picture can be encapsulated 
   into one transmission packet.  Consequently, a primary coded 
   picture and the corresponding redundant coded pictures may be 
   transmitted in consecutive packets in transmission order.  In order 
   to make the transmission scheme more tolerant of bursty 
   transmission errors, it is beneficial to transmit a primary coded 
   picture apart from the corresponding redundant coded pictures.  The 
   DON concept enables this. 
    
    
 11.5.      Remarks on Other Design Possibilities 
    
   The slice header syntax structure of the H.264 coding standard 
   contains the frame_num syntax element that can indicate the 
   decoding order of coded frames.  However, the usage of the 
   frame_num syntax element is not feasible or desirable to recover 
   the decoding order due to the following reasons: 
   o The receiver is required to parse at least one slice header per 
     coded picture (before passing the coded data to the decoder). 
   o Coded slices from multiple coded video sequences cannot be 
     interleaved, because the frame number syntax element is reset to 
     0 in each IDR picture. 
   o The coded fields of a complementary field pair share the same 
     value of the frame_num syntax element.  Thus, the decoding order 
     of the coded fields of a complementary field pair cannot be 
     recovered based on the frame_num syntax element or any other 
     syntax element of the H.264 coding syntax. 
    
   The RTP payload format for transport of MPEG-4 elementary streams 
   [28] enables interleaving of access units and transmission of 
   multiple access units in the same RTP packet.  An access unit is

 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
   specified in the H.264 coding standard to consist of all NAL units 
   that are associated with a primary coded picture according to 
   subclause 7.4.1.2 of [1].  Consequently, slices of different 
   pictures cannot be interleaved and the multi-picture slice 
   interleaving technique (see section 10.6) for improved error 
   resilience cannot be used. 
    
    
 12.     Open Issues 
    
   o Security section needs review. 
   o Is max-don-diff necessary? 
   o ITU-T H.241 provides a way for decoders to signal capability for 
     greater processing speed or memory amount than required in the 
     profile and level that is used.  H.241 specifies CustomMaxMBPS, 
     CustomMaxFS, CustomMaxDPB, and CustomMaxBRandCPB.  Should similar 
     parameters be specified as optional MIME/SDP parameters to 
     enhance the capability exchange procedure of SIP-based video 
     conferencing?

 Internet Draft                                    26 June, 2003 
   This memo contains the following technical changes relative to the 
   previous I-D: 
    
   o Assignment of DON values for NAL units in an STAP-B and decoding 
     order of NAL units in an STAP-B corrected and clarified.  De-
     packetization process changed accordingly. 
    
   o Derivation of DON for MTAPs changed to allow wraparound of DON 
     values within one MTAP. 
    
   o The use of RTP timestamp and picture timing SEI message is 
     clarified. 
    
   o Single NAL unit packetization mode introduced for compatibility 
     with ITU-T Recommendation H.241. 
    
   o Packetization modes simplified.  Single-picture and multi-picture 
     mode changed to non-interleaved and interleaved modes.  Packets 
     including DON cannot be mixed with packets not including DON 
     anymore, and therefore the derivation of the decoding order 
     becomes easier and more tolerant to transmission delay jitter. 
    
   o The optional packetization-mode MIME parameter introduced to 
     reflect the new packetization modes.  The previous parameter for 
     selecting the packetization mode, i.e., mtap-allowed, was 
     deleted. 
    
   o Created two types of fragmentation units, FU-A (not including 
     DON) and FU-B (including DON). 
    
   o Base64 encoding used in the optional parameter-sets MIME 
     parameter instead of hexadecimal encoding to improve compression 
     efficiency. 
    
   o Added an informative note clarifying why values of DON in 
     consecutive NAL units in decoding order are not required to be 
     incremented by one. 
    
   o Section 1.3 ("Network Abstraction Layer Unit Types") appeared in 
     the introduction section but actually specified such semantics of

     F and NRI that are specific only to the RTP payload format.  
     These semantics are now specified in section 5.3. 
    
   o A third option, max-don-diff, was added as an option to control 
     the receiver buffering in the interleaved packetization mode.  
     max-don-diff is specified similarly to the maximum displacement 
     parameter in the draft-ietf-avt-mpeg4-simple Internet Draft, but 
     instead of using a maximum difference in terms of RTP timestamps 
     a maximum difference in terms of decoding order numbers is used.  
     This design decision was made due to the following facts: 
     1) RTP timestamp indicates the capture/display timestamp.  
     2) H.264/AVC allows decoding order different from output order. 
     3) The receiver buffer is used to reorder packets from 
     transmission/reception order to decoding order. 
     4) Thus, displacement specified between differences in RTP 
     timestamps cannot be used to reception-to-decoding-order 
     reorganization. 
    
   o Editorial changes and new informative notes.
