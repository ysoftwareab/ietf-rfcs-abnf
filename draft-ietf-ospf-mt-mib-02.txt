1.  Introduction

   This memo defines an extension to the Open Shortest Path First
   version 2 Management Information Base (OSPFv2 MIB) for use with
   network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
   particular it describes objects and lists considerations for the
   management of OSPFv2 Multi-Topology routing.

1.1.  Change Log

   This section to be deleted when the document becomes approved.

1.1.1.  Initial version

   The initial version was submitted to the OSPF working group as a
   working group document on January 12, 2007.

1.1.2.  August 2007 version

   The following changes were made for the version submitted to the IETF
   as draft-ietf-ospf-mt-mib-01.txt:

   Revised issue date.

   Changed references to internet draft draft-ietf-ospf-mt-07 to
   references to RFC4915.

1.1.3.  April 2008 version

   The following changes were made for the version submitted to the IETF
   as draft-ietf-ospf-mt-mib-02.txt:

   Revised issue date.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Short Overview of Multi-topology routing.

   The multi-topology extensions to OSPFv2 are changes to the base
   version 2 specification enabling the construction of multiple routing
   topologies through a network of routing nodes participating in the
   protocol (through the use of these extensions).  Multi-topology
   routing (MT routing) is most useful in conjunction with class-based
   packet forwarding.  An individual routing topology may be associated
   with a packet classifier; packets belonging to some defined class are
   routed according to its associated routing topology.

   Fundamentally, MT routing engenders a routing node with the ability
   to automatically construct orthogonal routing topologies that provide
   a node with the means to forward distinct IP packets having identical
   destination IP addresses to different nexthop routers.  A routing
   node may, through packet inspection, associate a packet to a class; a
   class may be associated with a distinct topology.  For example, a
   packet classifier may be defined that associates TCP traffic with
   topology A and UDP traffic with topology B. It may be the case, for
   example, that at any single instant of time, an IP packet bearing a
   TCP payload destined for IP address Y is routed out interface I1
   whereas an IP packet bearing a UDP payload destined for IP address Y
   is routed out interface I2.  This because I1 leads to the nexthop
   router for topology A and I2 leads to the nexthop router for B; the
   exemplified nexthop routers being distinct.

   MT routing is essentially a reincarnation of TOS-based routing, the
   principal difference being that packet classification decisions are
   decoupled from the routing protocol itself -- any criteria may be
   used to associate a packet with a topology, not simply the policy
   implied by the encoded TOS byte definitions.

4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   The OSPFv2 MIB [RFC1850][RFC4750] defines basic information for the
   management of OSPFv2.

   This MIB extends [RFC1850][RFC4750] to enable the management of MT
   capable routing nodes.  This MIB module introduces a scalar used to
   determine a routing node's Multi-topology routing capabilities and a
   set of tables that are used instead of, or in addition to, their
   named equivalents contained within [RFC1850][RFC4750], in order to
   manage Multi-topology routing.

   It is envisaged that the value of the scalar 'ospfMtSupport', or the
   absence of an instance of this object in a router's MIB, will be used
   by applications to discover MT-capable routing nodes and hence used
   to select an appropriate set of objects from within this MIB and

Appendix A.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to make a MIB OID assignment for the OSPFv2-MT-MIB
   module under the appropriate subtree.

Appendix B.  Security Considerations

   There are many management objects defined in these MIB modules with a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may
   be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without

   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
