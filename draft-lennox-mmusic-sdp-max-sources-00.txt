Abstract

   The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a multi-point protocol,
   supporting multiple simultaneous sending sources in an RTP session.

   However, many existing RTP endpoints cannot usefully receive more
   than one simultaneous source.  This document provides a Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) attribute that allows endpoints to
   indicate the maximum number of sources they can usefully receive.

Internet-Draft  Max Media Source Count Indication in SDP       July 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] is a multi-point
   protocol.  It supports multiple simultaneous media senders, and, as
   documented in RTP Topologies [RFC5117], scales from two-party point-
   to-point sessions to large, wide-area sessions.

   However, many existing systems do not make use of this capability.
   Especially for Voice-over-IP and multimedia conferencing systems
   using SIP [RFC3261], many existing terminals will not decode more
   than a single RTP stream at a time per RTP session.  Indeed, many
   deployed systems are known to misbehave badly upon receiving more
   than one simultaneous RTP stream in an RTP session.

   Thus, even if endpoints can receive, decode, and usefully present
   multiple sources in an RTP session, there is no portable way for
   their peers to know this and take advantage of it.

   To remedy this situation, this document defines a new SDP attribute,
   "max-sources", which specifies the maximum number of sources that an
   endpoint in an RTP session can usefully process.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.


3.  The "max-sources" Media Attribute

   This section defines a new SDP media-level attribute, "max-sources",
   which indicates the maximum number of sources supported in an RTP
   session.


   a=max-sources:<source count>
   a=max-sources:unlimited


   The SDP media attribute "max-sources" indicates the maximum number of
   RTP sources that an RTP receiver supports within an RTP session.
   <source count> is the maximum number of sources that can usefully be
   decoded, expressed as a positive decimal integer or the string
   "unlimited".  Thus, it indicates the maximum number of RTP senders
   that should be present in the session, other than those that the SDP

   author itself will send.

   The "max-sources" media attribute MAY be used for any RTP-based media
   transport.  It is not defined for other transports.

   The "max-sources" attribute is only defined for SDP Offer/Answer
   [RFC3264] messages, not declarative SDP.  A receiver of a "max-
   sources" attribute in an offer or answer SHOULD restrict the number
   of sources that it transmits on the RTP session to the number of
   sources mentioned in the SDP message.

   The "max-sources" attribute does not support the value of "0".  If no
   sources are supported on a session, an appropriate SDP sendrecv
   attribute (e.g. "sendonly") SHOULD be used instead.

   The "max-sources" attribute SHOULD NOT be used with RTP sessions sent
   over any-source multicast (those that RTP Topologies [RFC5117]
   describes as "Topo-Multicast", or the multicast side of "Topo-
   Translator"), because new participants cannot immediately determine
   how many existing senders are present in the RTP session.

   For the unicast portion of translator-based topologies, it is the
   translator's responsibility to forward only the appropriate number of
   sources along the unicast path.

   Figure 1 in Section 5 gives a formal Augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) [RFC5234] grammar for the "max-sources" attribute.

   The "max-sources" media attribute is not dependent on charset.


4.  Backward Compatibility

   As mentioned in the introduction, it is unclear with existing
   endpoints whether they can usefully support multiple sources on an
   RTP session.  In most circumstances, therefore, existing endpoints
   will default to sending only a single source per session.  This will
   be compatible with any requested value of "max-sources" even if the
   receiver of the SDP does not support the attribute.


5.  Formal Grammar

   This section gives a formal Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234] grammar for each the "max-sources" media attribute.

   max-sources-attr = "max-sources:" ( 1*DIGIT / "unlimited" )

   attribute =/ max-sources-attr

6.  Security Considerations

   All the security implications of RTP [RFC3550] and of SDP [RFC4566]
   apply.  Explicitly indicating the number of RTP sources supported in
   an RTP media stream does not appear to add further security issues.


7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  New SDP Media-Level Attribute

   This document defines a new SDP media-level attribute, "max-sources".
   This attribute should be registered by IANA under "Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" under "att-field (media level
   only)".  Its format is defined in Section 3
