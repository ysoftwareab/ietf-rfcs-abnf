   I2NSF Network Security Functions Facing Interface YANG Data Model
           draft-kim-i2nsf-nsf-facing-interface-data-model-01

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model corresponding to the
   information model for Network Security Functions (NSF) facing
   interface in Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF).  It
   describes a data model for three security capabilities (i.e., network
   security functions), such as network security control, content
   security control, and attack mitigation control, as defined in the
   information model for the I2NSF NSF capabilities.

Internet-Draft    NSF Facing Interface YANG Data Model        March 2017


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] data model for security
   services with the information model for Network Security Functions
   (NSF) facing interface in Interface to Network Security Functions
   (I2NSF).  It provides a specific information model and the
   corresponding data models for three security capabilities (i.e.,
   network security functions), such as network security control,
   content security control, and attack mitigation control, as defined
   in [i2nsf-cap-interface-im].  With these data model, I2NSF controller
   can control the capabilities of NSFs.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology described in
   [i2nsf-cap-interface-im][i2rs-rib-data-model]
   [supa-policy-info-model].  Especially, the following terms are from
   [supa-policy-info-model]:

   o  Data Model: A data model is a representation of concepts of
      interest to an environment in a form that is dependent on data
      repository, data definition language, query language,
      implementation language, and protocol.

   o  Information Model: An information model is a representation of
      concepts of interest to an environment in a form that is
      independent of data repository, data definition language, query
      language, implementation language, and protocol.

3.1.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams
   [i2rs-rib-data-model] is as follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node and "*"
      denotes a "list" and "leaf-list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

4.  Information Model Structure

   Figure 1 shows an overview of a structure tree of network security
   control, content security control, and attack mitigation control, as
   defined in the [i2nsf-cap-interface-im].

   The following changes are made from

   o  Rules for network security (e.g., iptables) and contents security
      (e.g., Suricata) are added.

   o  Some lists are replaced with containers, and also some leafs are
      correspondingly replaced with leaf-lists.
