1 Abstract

   This document specifies a payload format for generic forward error 
   correction to achieve uneven level protection (ULP) of media 
   encapsulated in RTP. It is an extension to the forward error correction 
   scheme specified in RFC 2733 [1], and it is also based on the 
   exclusive-or (parity) operation. The payload format allows end systems 
   to transmit using arbitrary protection length and levels, in additional 
   to using arbitrary block lengths. It also allows for the both complete 
   recovery of the critical payload and RTP header fields, and partial 
   recovery when complete recovery is not possible due to the packet lost 
   situation. This scheme is backward compatible with non-FEC capable 
   hosts, and hosts that are only capable of FEC schemes specified in 
   RFC2733 [1], so that receivers which do not wish to implement ULP 
   forward error correction can just ignore the extensions.

2 Introduction

   Because of the real time nature of many applications, they have more 
   strict delay requirement than a pure data transmission. As a result, 
   retransmission of the lost packets is generally not a valid option for 
   such applications. A better way to attempt to recover information about 
   a lost packet in this case is FEC. Thus forward error correction (FEC) 
   has been used to compensate for packet loss in the Internet [2]. In 
   particular, the error correction has to be on the packet level, because 
   any correction within the packet will be useless if the whole packet is 
   lost.

   In many cases for the network connections, the bandwidth is a very 
   limited resource. However, many traditional FEC schemes are not designed 
   for optimal usage of the limited bandwidth resource. A more efficient 
   way is to provide different protection levels for different parts of the 
   data stream of different importance. These unequal error protection 
   schemes make more efficient use of the bandwidth to provide overall 
   better protection of the data stream against the losts. To support these 
   mechanisms, protocol support is required. However, most of the unequal 
   error protection schemes require the knowledge of the importance level 
   or class of data stream. As a result, most of such schemes depend on the 
   nature and structure of the media being protected, and are not generic.

   In many cases for multimedia streams, we have some very important 
   knowledge about the stream. In general, the more important parts of the 
   data are always at the beginning of the data packet. This is the common 
   practice for most codecs, since the beginning of the packet is closer to 
   the re-synchronization marker at the header and thus is more likely to 
   be correctly decoded if the data is variable length coded. Also, almost 
   all media formats have the frame headers at the beginning of the packet.

   For video streams, most modern formats have optional data patitioning 
   modes to improve error resilience, where the video macroblock header 
   data, the motion vector data and DCT coefficient data are seperated in 
   their individual partitions. In ITU-T H.263 version 3, when the optional 
   data partitioned syntax of Annex V is enabled, when the optional data 
   partioning mode is enabled in MPEG-4 Visual Simple Profile, the video 
   macroblock (MB) header and motion vector partitions (which are much more 
   important to the quality of video reconstruction) transmitted in the 
   partition at the beginning of the video packet while residue DCT 
   coefficient partitions (which are less important) are transmitted in the 
   partition close to the end of the packet. Because the data is arranged 
   in the order of more important data to less important data, it would 
   help to provide more protection to the beginning part of the packet.

   In case of audio stream, many new audio codecs do encode into bitstream 
   data of different importance classes and transmit them in the order of 
   more important to less important. Applying more protection to the 
   beginning of the packet would benifit. Even for uniform-significance 
   audio streams, special stretching techniques can be applied the 
   partially recovered audio data packets. Also, if there is audio 
   redundancy coding, it makes sense to have more protection applied to the 
   original data which is at the first half of the packet, while with no 
   protections for the redundant copies which is at the trailing half of 
   the packet.

   So the application should benefit from unequal error protections scheme 
   with more emphasis on the beginning part of the packets. This document 
   defines a payload format for RTP [3] which allows for generic forward 
   error correction with unequal error protection for real time media. The 
   payload data is protected by one or more protection levels. The lower 
   protection level provides more protection by using smaller group size 
   (compare to higher protection levels) to generate the FEC packet. The 
   data that is closer to the beginning of the packet is protected by lower 
   protection levels because these data are in general more important and 
   carrying more information than those further behind.

   In this context, generic means that the FEC protocol is (1)    
   independent of the nature of the media being protected, be it audio, 
   video, or otherwise, (2) flexible enough to support a wide variety of 
   FEC mechanisms, (3) designed for adaptivity so that the FEC technique 
   can be modified easily without out of band signaling, and (4) supportive 
   of a number of different mechanisms for transporting the FEC 
   packets.

3 Terminology

   The following terms are used throughout this document:

        Media Payload: is a piece of raw, un-protected user data which is 
        to be transmitted from the sender. The media payload is placed 
        inside of an RTP packet.

        Media Header: is the RTP header for the packet containing the 
        media payload.

        Media Packet: The combination of a media payload and media header 
        is called a media packet.

        FEC Packet: The forward error correction algorithms at the 
        transmitter take the media packets as an input. They output both 
        the media packets that they are passed, and new packets called FEC 
        packets. The FEC packets are formatted according to the rules 
        specified in this document.

        FEC Header: The FEC header is the header information contained in 
        an FEC packet.

        FEC Payload: The FEC payload is the payload in an FEC packet.

        Associated: An FEC packet is said to be "associated" with one or 
        more media packets when those media packets are used to generate 
        the FEC packet (by use of the exclusive or operation).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].

4 Basic Operation

   The payload format described here is used whenever a participant in an 
   RTP session would like to protect a media stream it is sending with 
   uneven level protection (ULP) FEC. The ULP FEC supported by the format 
   are based on simple exclusive or (xor) parities as used also in RFC 2733 
   [1]. The sender takes the packets from the media stream that need to be 
   protected, and determines the protection level it wants for these 
   packets and the length for each level. The data of each level are 
   grouped in a way that is described below to provide each level a 
   different error resilience capability by adjusting the size of the 
   group. An xor operation is applied across the payload to generate the 
   FEC information for that level. The lower protection levels (which 
   provides high protection, or high error resilience) are applied to the 
   data that is closer to the beginning of the packet to ensure more 
   protection there. Based on the procedures defined here, the result is an 
   RTP packet containing ULP FEC information. This packet can be used at 
   the receiver to recover any one packets used to generate the FEC packet, 
   or to recover part of the packet depending on the packet lost situation. 
   By using uneven error protection, this scheme can make more efficient 
   use of the channel bandwidth, and provide more efficient error 
   resilience for transmission over error prone channels.

   The payload format contains information that allows the sender to tell 
   the receiver exactly which media packets are protected by this ULP FEC 
   packet and the protection levels and lengths for each of them. 
   Specifically, each ULP FEC packet contains a set of protection length 
   and bitmask, called the offset mask, for each protection level. If bit i 
   in the mask m(k) (i.e., the mask for protection level k) is set to 1, 
   data of length L(k) in the media packet with sequence number N + i is 
   protected by this ULP FEC packet at level k. N is called the sequence 
   number base, and is sent in the FEC packet as well. The protection 
   length, offset mask and payload type are sufficient to signal arbitrary 
   parity based forward error correction schemes with little overhead. 
   There are a set of rules as described below on how the mask should be 
   set for different protection levels. This will ensure that if data of 
   protection level k for a packet is recoverable, all the data of 
   protection level lower than k is recoverable for that particular packet.

   This document also describes procedures that allow the receiver to make 
   use of the ULP FEC without having to know the details of specific codes. 
   This allows the sender much flexibility; it can adapt the code in use 
   based on network conditions, and be certain the receivers can still make 
   use of the FEC for recovery.

   At the receiver, the ULP FEC and original media are received. If no 
   media packets are lost, the ULP FEC can be ignored. In the event of 
   loss, the FEC packets can be combined with other media and FEC packets 
   that have been received, resulting in recovery of the whole or part of 
   the missing media packets. 

   RTP packets which contain data formatted according to this specification 
   (i.e., ULP FEC packets) are using dynamic RTP payload types.

5 RTP Media Packet Structure

   The formatting of the media packets is unaffected by FEC. If the FEC is 
   sent as a separate stream, the media packets are sent as if there was 
   no FEC.

   This lends to a very efficient encoding. When little (or no) FEC is 
   used, there are mostly media packets being sent. This means that the 
   overhead (present in FEC packets only) tracks the amount of FEC in use.

6 FEC Packet Structure

   An FEC packet is constructed by placing an ULP FEC header and ULP FEC 
   payload in the RTP payload, as shown in Figure 1:

   Figure 1: ULP FEC Packet Structure


6.1 RTP Header of FEC Packets

   The version field is set to 2. The padding bit is computed via the 
   protection operation, defined below. The extension bit is also computed 
   via the protection operation. The SSRC value will generally be the same 
   as the SSRC value of the media stream it protects. It MAY be different 
   if the FEC stream is being demultiplexed via the SSRC value. The CC 
   value is computed via the protection operation. The CSRC list is never 
   present, independent of the value of the CC field. The extension is 
   never present, independent of the value of the X bit. The marker bit is 
   computed via the protection operation.

   The sequence number has the standard definition: it MUST be one higher 
   than the sequence number in the previously transmitted FEC packet. The 
   timestamp MUST be set to the value of the media RTP clock at the 
   instant the FEC packet is transmitted. This results in the TS value in 
   FEC packets to be monotonically increasing, independent of the FEC 
   scheme.

   The payload type for the FEC packet is determined through dynamic, out 
   of band means. According to RFC1889 [3], RTP participants which cannot 
   recognize a payload type must discard it. This provides backwards 
   compatibility. The FEC mechanisms can then be used in a multicast group 
   with mixed FEC-capable and FEC-incapable receivers.

6.2 FEC Header

   This header is 12 bytes. The format of the header is shown in Figure 2, 
   and consists of an SN base field, length recovery field, E field, PT 
   recovery field, mask field and TS recovery field.


    0                   1                   2                   3

   This is exactly as the FEC header used in RFC 2733 [1]. The usage will 
   also be the exactly the same as specified as in RFC 2733, except that 
   the E bit MUST set to one for this version.

6.3 ULP Layer Header

   The ULP Layer Header is 2 bytes for ULP layer 0, and 5 bytes for ULP 
   layer 1 and higher. The format of the header is shown in Figure 3 and 
   Figure 4, and consists of a Protection Length field, and mask field (for 
   layer 1 and higher headers).

   Figure 4: ULP Layer Header Format (Level 1 and higher)


   The Protection Length field is 16 bits. It indicates the protection 
   length provided by the ULP FEC for the current protection level (i.e., 
   the payload length for the current protection level after the header).

   The mask field is 24 bits. If bit i in the mask is set to 1, then 
   the media packet with sequence number N + i is associated with this ULP 
   FEC packet of current protection level, where N is the SN Base field in 
   the ULP FEC packet header. The least significant bit corresponds to 
   i=0, and the most significant to i=24.

   The SN base field in the FEC header MUST be set to the minimum sequence 
   number of those media packets protected by ULP FEC. This allows for the 
   ULP FEC operation to extend over any string of at most 24 packets.

   The setting of mask field shall follow the following rules:

      a. A packet can only be protected by each protection level once.

      b. For a packet to be protected at level p, it must also be protect 
         at level p-1.

      c. Packets that are protected by one ULP FEC packet at level p-1 must 
         also be protected within a same ULP FEC packet at level p. Note: 
         the protection level p might be in different ULP FEC packet from 
         protection level p-1.

      d. Packets that are protected in a packet with protection level p 
         (even the packet is not protected at that level), must not be 
         protected by levels equal or lower than p at later FEC packets.

   The payload of the FEC packet of each level is the protection operation 
   applied to the concatenation of the CSRC list, RTP extension, media 
   payload, and padding of the media packets associated with the FEC 
   packet. The detail is described in the next section on the protection 
   operation

7 Protection Operation

   The protection operation involves copying the payload, padding with 
   zeroes, and computing the xor across the resulting bit strings. In 
   additional, for protection of level 0, it also involves concatenating 
   specific fields from the RTP header of the media packet before the 
   payload data. The resulting bit string is used to generate the ULP FEC 
   packet.

   The following procedure MAY be followed for the protection operation. 
   Other procedures MAY be followed, but the end result MUST be identical 
   to the one described here.

7.1 Protection Level 0

   For each media packet to be protected, a bit string is generated by 
   concatenating the following fields together in the order specifed:

        o Padding Bit (1 bit)

        o Extension Bit (1 bit)

        o CC bits (4 bits)

        o Marker bit (1 bit)

        o Payload Type (7 bits)

        o Timestamp (32 bits)

        o Unsigned network-ordered 16 bit representation of the sum of the 
        lengths of the CSRC List, length of the padding, length of the 
        extension, and length of the media packet (16 bits)

        o if CC is nonzero, the CSRC List (variable length)

        o if X is 1, the Header Extension (variable length)

        o the payload (variable length)

        o Padding, if present (variable length)

   Note that the Padding Bit (first entry above) forms the most 
   significant bit of the bit string.

   If the lengths of the bit strings are not equal, each bit string that is 
   shorter than the Protection Length 0 plus 62 bits, MUST be padded to 
   that length. Any value for the pad may be used. The pad MUST be added at 
   the end of the bit string.

   The parity operation is then applied across the bit strings. The result 
   is the bit string used to build the FEC packet. Call this the ULP FEC 
   bit string (level 0).

   The first (most significant) bit in the FEC bit string is written into 
   the Padding Bit of the FEC packet. The second bit in the FEC bit string 
   is written into the Extension bit of the FEC packet. The next four bits 
   of the FEC bit string are written into the CC field of the FEC packet. 
   The next bit of the FEC bit string is written into the marker bit of the 
   FEC packet. The next 7 bits of the FEC bit string are written into the 
   PT recovery field in the FEC packet header. The next 32 bits of the FEC 
   bit string are written into the TS recovery field in the packet header. 
   The next 16 bits are written into the length recovery field in the FEC 
   packet header. This is exactly the same as in RFC 2733 [1].

   The remaining bits (of length Protection Length 0) are set to be the 
   payload of the ULP FEC packet.

7.2 Protection Level 1 and higher

   The protected data of the corresponding packets are copied into the bit 
   strings. If the packet ends before the Protection Length of the current 
   level is reached, the string is padded to that length. Any value for 
   the pad may be used. The pad MUST be added at the end of the bit 
   string.

   The parity operation is applied across the protected data of the 
   corresponding packets. The generated ULP FEC bit of that level is then 
   appended to the payload of the ULP FEC packet.

8 Recovery Procedures

   The FEC packets allow end systems to recover from the loss of media 
   packets. All of the header fields of the missing packets, including 
   CSRC lists, extensions, padding bits, marker and payload type, are 
   recoverable.  This section describes the procedure for performing this 
   recovery.

   Recovery requires two distinct operations. The first determines which 
   packets (media and FEC) must be combined in order to recover a missing 
   packet. Once this is done, the second step is to actually reconstruct 
   the data. The second step MUST be performed as described below. The 
   first step MAY be based on any algorithm chosen by the implementor. 
   Different algorithms result in a tradeoff between complexity and the 
   ability to recover missing packets if at all possible.

8.1 Reconstruction of Level 0

   Let T be the list of packets (FEC and media) which can be combined to 
   recover some media packet xi. The procedure is as follows:

        1.   For the media packets in T, compute the bit string as 
        described in the protection operation of the previous section.

        2.   For the FEC packet in T, compute the bit string in the same 
        fashion, except always set the CSRC list, extension, and padding 
        to null. Read the Protection Length 0. Read string of that length
        from that FEC packet.

        3.   If any of the bit strings generated from the media packets 
        are shorter than the bit string generated from the FEC packet, pad 
        them to be the same length as the bit string generated from the 
        FEC. The padding MUST be added at the end of the bit string, and 
        MAY be of any value.

        4.   Perform the exclusive or (parity) operation across the bit 
        strings, resulting in a recovery bit string.

        5.   Create a new packet with the standard 12 byte RTP header and 
        no payload.

        6.   Set the version of the new packet to 2.

        7.   Set the Padding bit in the new packet to the first bit in the 
        recovery bit string.

        8.   Set the Extension bit in the new packet to the second bit in 
        the recovery bit string.

        9.   Set the CC field to the next four bits in the recovery bit 
        string.

        10.  Set the marker bit in the new packet to the next bit in the 
        recovery bit string.

        11.  Set the payload type in the new packet to the next 7 bits in 
        the recovery bit string.

        12.  Set the SN field in the new packet to xi.

        13.  Set the TS field in the new packet to the next 32 bits in the 
        recovery bit string.

        14.  Take the next 16 bits of the recovery bit string. Whatever 
        unsigned integer this represents (assuming network-order), take 
        that many bytes from the recovery bit string and append them to 
        the new packet. This represents the CSRC list, extension, payload, 
        and padding.

        15.  Set the SSRC of the new packet to the SSRC of the media 
        stream it's protecting.

   This procedure will recover both the header and payload of an RTP 
   packet up to the Protection Length of level 0.

8.2 Reconstruction of Level 1 and higher

   Let T be the list of packets (FEC and media) which can be combined to 
   recover some media packet xi. The procedure is as follows:

        1.   For the media packet in T, get the protection length of that 
        level. Copy the data of the that protection level (data of the 
        length read following the level header) to the bit strings.

        2.   If any of the bit strings generated from the media packets 
        are shorter than the Protection Length of the current level, pad 
        them to that length. The padding MUST be added at the end of the 
        bit string, and MUST be of the same value as used in the process 
        of generating the ULP FEC packets.

        3.   Perform the exclusive or (parity) operation across the bit 
        strings, resulting in a recovery bit string.

   Because the data protected at lower protection level is always 
   recoverable if the higher level protected data is recoverable. This 
   procedure (together with the procedure for the lower protection levels) 
   will recover both the header and payload of an RTP packet up to the 
   Protection Length of the current level.

9 Examples

   Consider 4 media packets to be sent, A, B, C and D, from SSRC 2. Their 
   sequence numbers are 8, 9, 10 and 11, respectively, with timestamps of 
   3, 5, 7 and 9, respectively. Packet A and C uses payload type 11, and 
   packet B and D uses payload type 18. Packet A is has 200 bytes of 
   payload, packet B 140, packet C 100 and packet D 340. Packet A and C 
   have their marker bit set. 

9.1 An example that has only protection level 0

   Suppose we want to protect the data of length L0 = 70 bytes of them at 
   the beginning of these packets, as illustrated in Figure 5 below.

   An ULP FEC packet is generated from these four packets. We assume that 
   payload type 127 is used to indicate an FEC packet. The resulting RTP 
   header is shown in Figure 6.

   The FEC header in the FEC packet is shown in Figure 7.

   The ULP header for layer 0 in the FEC packet is shown in Figure 8.

9.2 An example that generates identical protection as in RFC 2733

   We can choose to extend the level 0 protection to cover all the length 
   of the packets (as shown in Figure 9). This is give us almost identical 
   protection as provided in RFC 2733. Please note that when using ULP this 
   way, each ULP FEC packet will use two more bytes (for the level 0 
   payload length field) than that of RFC 2733 - a small price to pay for 
   the extra flexbility.

9.3 An example that has two protection levels (0 and 1)

   A more complete example is to use ULP at two levels. The level 0 
   ULP will put more protection to the beginning part of the payload 
   packets. The level 1 ULP will apply additional protection to the 
   rest of the packets. This is illustrated in Figure 11. In this 
   example, we take L0 = 70 and L1 = 90.
