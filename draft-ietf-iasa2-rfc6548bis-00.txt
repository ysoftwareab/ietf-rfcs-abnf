                  Independent Submission Editor Model
                     draft-ietf-iasa2-rfc6548bis-00

Abstract

   This document describes the function and responsibilities of the RFC
   Independent Submission Editor (ISE).  The Independent Submission
   stream is one of the stream producers that create draft RFCs, with
   the ISE as its stream approver.  The ISE is overall responsible for
   activities within the Independent Submission stream, working with
   draft editors and reviewers, and interacts with the RFC Production
   Center and Publisher, and the RFC Series Editor (RSE).  The ISE is
   appointed by the IAB, and also interacts with the IETF Administrative
   Oversight Committee (IAOC).

Status of This Memo

1.  Introduction

   The RFC Editor Model [RFC6635] defines a set of streams that produce
   draft RFCs, which are submitted for publication.  This document
   defines the management function for the Independent Submission
   stream, specifically the role of Independent Submission Editor (ISE).
   This document is a derivative of [RFC5620], Section 3.2, and was
   separated out from [RFC6635].

   This document obsoletes [RFC5620] in combination with [RFC6635].

2.  Independent Submission Editor

   The ISE is an individual who is responsible for the Independent
   Submission stream of RFCs, as defined by [RFC4844].  The Independent
   Submission stream and the ISE are not under the authority or
   direction of the RSE or the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC)
   (see [RFC6635]).  As noted below, the ISE is appointed by and is
   responsible directly to the IAB.

2.1.  Qualifications

   The ISE is a senior position for which the following qualifications
   are desired:

   1.  Technical competence, i.e., broad technical experience and
       perspective across a wide range of Internet technologies and
       applications, and also the ability to work effectively with
       portions of that spectrum in which they have no personal
       expertise.

   2.  Thorough familiarity with the RFC series.

   3.  An ability to define and constitute advisory and document review
       arrangements.  If those arrangements include an Editorial Board
       similar to the current one or some equivalent arrangement, the
       ability to assess the technical competence of potential Editorial
       Board members (see Section 3).

   4.  Good standing in the technical community, in and beyond the IETF.

   5.  Demonstrated editorial skills, good command of the English
       language, and demonstrated history of being able to work
       effectively with technical documents and materials created by
       others.

   6.  The ability to work effectively in a multi-actor environment with
       divided authority and responsibility similar to that described in
       [RFC6635].

2.2.  Responsibilities

   The ISE is an individual who may have assistants and who is
   responsible for:

   1.  Maintaining technical quality of the Independent Submission
       stream.

   2.  Reviewing, approving, and processing Independent Submissions.

   3.  Forwarding draft RFCs in the Independent Submission stream to the
       RFC Production Center.

   4.  Defining and developing the scope of the Independent Submission
       stream as a part of the overall RFC Editor function [RFC6635].

   5.  Reviewing and approving RFC errata for Independent Submissions.

   6.  Coordinating work and conforming to general RFC Series policies
       as specified by the IAB and RSE.

   7.  Providing statistics and documentation as requested by the RSE
       and/or IAOC.

   The ISE may choose to select individuals to participate in an
   Advisory Board for assistance in special topics as the ISE deems
   appropriate.  Such an Advisory Board exists at the pleasure of the
   ISE, and its members serve at the pleasure of the ISE.

   The individual with the listed qualifications is selected by the IAB
   after input has been collected from the community.  An approach
   similar to the one used by the IAB to select an IAOC member every
   other year as described in [RFC4333] should be used.

   While the ISE itself is considered a volunteer function, the IAB
   considers maintaining the Independent Submission stream part of the
   IAB's supported activities.  Therefore, the IAOC should include these
   costs in the IASA budget.

3.  Independent Submission Editorial Board

   The ISE is supported by an Editorial Board for the review of
   Independent Submission stream documents.  This board is known as the
   Independent Submission Editorial Board.  This volunteer Editorial
   Board exists at the pleasure of the ISE, and its members serve at the
   pleasure of the ISE.  The existence of this board is simply noted
   within this model, and additional discussion of such is considered
   out of scope of this document.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document has no specific security implications, however the same
   security considerations as those in [RFC4846] and [RFC4844] apply.

5.  IAB Members at the Time of Approval

   Bernard Aboba, Ross Callon, Alissa Cooper, Joel Halpern, Spencer
   Dawkins, Russ Housley, David Kessens, Olaf Kolkman, Danny McPherson,
   Jon Peterson, Andrei Robachevsky, Dave Thaler, Hannes Tschofenig.

6.  Acknowledgements

   Generous thanks to Joel Hapern for all his help with this document,
   and for all his work on [RFC6635]).  Thanks also to the IAB members,
   whose comments and suggestions were both welcome and useful.
