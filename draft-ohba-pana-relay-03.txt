Internet-Draft             PANA Relay Element              February 2011


1.  Introduction

   Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA)
   [RFC5191] is a UDP-based protocol to perform EAP authentication
   between a PANA Client (PaC) and a PANA Authentication Agent (PAA).

   This document specifies PANA Relay Element (PRE) functionality which
   enables PANA messaging between a PaC and a PAA where the two nodes
   cannot reach each other by means of regular IP routing.  For example,
   in ZigBee IP that uses 6LoWPAN [RFC4944], a joining node (PaC) can
   only use a link-local IPv6 address to communicate with a parent node
   prior to PANA authentication.  The PAA typically resides in a 6LowPAN
   Border Router (6LBR) [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd] which is often multiple IP
   hops away from the PaC.  The PRE implemented on the parent node is
   used for relaying PANA messages between the PaC and the PAA in this
   scenario.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  PANA Relay Element

   The PANA Relay Element (PRE) is a node that is located between the
   PaC and the PAA.  It is responsible for relaying the PANA messages
   between the PaC and the PAA.  The PRE does not need to maintain per-
   PaC state.  From the PaC's perspective, the PRE appears as the PAA.
   Normal IP routing is performed between the PRE and the PAA.  It is
   assumed that the PRE's IP address that is reachable from the PaC is
   known to the PaC prior to PANA authentication by some means that is
   not specified in this document.  It is also assumed that the PAA's IP
   address that is reachable from the PRE is known to the PRE by some
   means that is not specified in this document.

   The PRE and the PAA support the relay operation as follows.

   When the PRE receives a PANA message from the PaC, it creates a PANA-
   Relay (PRY) message (see Section 4.1) containing a Relayed-Message
   AVP (see Section 5.2) and a PaC-Information AVP (see Section 5.1).
   The Relayed-Message AVP encapsulates the entire PANA Message received
   from the PaC.  The PaC-Information AVP contains the PaC's IP address
   and UDP port number.  The PRY message is sent to the PAA.

Internet-Draft             PANA Relay Element              February 2011


   When the PAA receives the PRY message, it retrieves the PaC-
   originated PANA message from the Relayed-Message AVP and the PaC's IP
   address and UDP port number from the PaC-Information AVP.  The PaC-
   originated PANA message is processed in the same way as specified in
   [RFC5191], with the following exceptions:

   (a) The IP address and the port number contained in the PaC-
   Information AVP and the source IP address and UDP port number of the
   PRE are used to identify the PaC among multiple PANA-Client-
   Initiation messages sent from different PaCs through the same PRE or
   sent from more than one PaC with the same the IP address and the port
   number through different PREs.

   (b) The IP address and the port number contained in the PaC-
   Information AVP are maintained in the PANA session attribute "IP
   address and UDP port number of the PaC".

   (c) The IP address and UDP port number of the PRE is stored in a new
   PANA session attribute "IP address and UDP port number of the PRE".
   A PANA session is referred to as a relayed PANA session if this
   attribute has a non-null value.

   When the PAA originates a PANA message for a relayed PANA session, it
   sends a PRY message to the PRE's IP address and UDP port number.  The
   PRY message includes a Relayed-Message AVP containing the PAA-
   originated PANA message and also includes a PaC-Information AVP
   containing the PaC's IP address and UDP port number.

   When the PRE receives the PRY message, it retrieves the PAA-
   originated PANA message from the Relayed-Message and the PaC's IP
   address and UDP port number from and PaC-Information AVPs.  The PAA-
   originated PANA message is sent to the PaC's IP address and UDP port
   number.

   The Session Identifier and Sequence Number of a PRY message are set
   to zero.  A PRY message is never retransmitted by the PRE or the PAA.
   The PRE and PAA do not advance their incoming or outgoing sequence
   numbers for request when transmitting or receiving a PRY message.
   Note that the PANA message carried in a Relayed-Message may be
   retransmitted by the PaC or PAA, leading to transmission of another
   PRY carrying the same Relayed-Message.

   A PAA that supports this specification MUST be able to process PRY
   messages for PaC-initiated PANA sessions.

   This specification assumes there is at most one PRE between the PaC
   and the PAA.  Performing relay operation on a PANA message that is
   already relayed (i.e., carried inside a PRY message) is out-of scope

3.  Security of Messages Sent between PRE and PAA

   PREs and PAAs must exchange PRY messages securely.  Please see
   Section 6 for a detailed threat analysis.  Required security can be



Duffy, et al.            Expires August 8, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             PANA Relay Element              February 2011


   achieved by using IPsec or another mechanism (e.g., via physical
   security, cryptographically-secured link-layers, DTLS, etc.).  This
   section describes how IPsec [RFC4301] can be used to handle such
   threats.

   When IPsec is used, each PRE must have an established pairwise trust
   relationship with a PAA.  That is, if messages from a PaC will be
   relayed by a PRE to a PAA, the PRE and PAA must be configured to use
   IPsec for the messages they exchange.

   PREs and PAAs that support secure PRE to PAA communication use IPsec
   under the following conditions:

   Selectors        PREs are manually configured with the addresses of
                    the PAAs to which PANA messages are to be forwarded.
                    PAAs that will be using IPsec for securing PANA
                    messages must also be configured with a list of the
                    PREs to which messages will be returned.  The
                    selectors for the PREs and PAAs will be the pairs of
                    addresses defining PREs and PAAs that exchange PANA
                    messages on the PANA UDP port 716 in their source or
                    destination port.

   Mode             PREs and PAAs use transport mode and ESP.  The
                    information in PANA messages is not generally
                    considered confidential, so encryption need not be
                    used (i.e., NULL encryption can be used).

   Key management   Because the PREs and PAAs are used within an
                    organization, public key schemes are not necessary.
                    Because the PREs and PAA must be manually
                    configured, manually configured key management may
                    suffice, but does not provide defense against
                    replayed messages.  Accordingly, IKE with preshared
                    secrets SHOULD be supported.  IKE with public keys
                    MAY be supported.

   Security policy  PANA messages between PREs and PAAs should only be
                    accepted from PANA peers as identified in the local
                    configuration.

   Authentication   Shared keys, indexed to the source IP address of the
                    received PANA message, are adequate in this
                    application.

   Availability     Appropriate IPsec implementations are likely to be
                    available for PAAs and for PREs in more featureful
                    devices used in enterprise and core ISP networks.
                    IPsec is less likely to be available for PREs in low
                    end devices primarily used in the home or small
                    office markets.


4.  PANA messages for Relay Operation

4.1.  PANA-Relay

   The PANA-Relay (PRY) message is sent by the PRE to the PAA or by the
   PAA to the PRE.  It contains one PaC-Information AVP and one Relayed-
   Message AVP.  The PRY message SHOULD NOT carry other AVPs.

   In a PRE-originated PRY message, the PaC-Information AVP contains an
   IP address and the UDP port number of the PANA message that was
   originated by the PaC and is contained in the Relayed-Message AVP.

   In a PAA-originated PRY message, the information in the PaC-
   Information AVP MUST be copied from the "IP address and UDP port
   number of the PaC" attribute of the associated PANA session
   [RFC5191].

   The Session Identifier and Sequence Number field of any PRY message
   MUST be set to zero.  A PRY message MUST NOT be retransmitted by the
   PRE or the PAA.  The PRE and PAA MUST NOT advance their incoming or
   outgoing sequence numbers for request when transmitting or receiving
   a PRY message.

      PANA-Relay ::= < PANA-Header: 5 >
                     { PaC-Information }
                     { Relayed-Message }
                    *[ AVP ]



5.  PANA AVPs for Relay Operation

5.1.  PaC-Information AVP

   The PaC-Information AVP (AVP Code 10) is of type OctetString and
   contains an IP address (16-octet for an IPv6 address or 4-octet for
   an IPv4 address) followed by a 2-octet UDP port number of the PaC,
   both encoded in network-byte order.

Internet-Draft             PANA Relay Element              February 2011


5.2.  Relayed-Message AVP

   The Relayed-Message (AVP Code 11) is of type OctetString and contains
   a relayed PANA message.


6.  Security Considerations

   A PRE's main objective is to assist transport of PANA messages
   between the PaC and the PAA.  Relay operation performed between the
   PRE and the PAA forms an additional logical link for relaying the
   end-to-end PANA messages between the PaC and the PAA.  In that sense,
   a PRE resembles a bridge or a router that sits between the PaC and
   the PAA when non-relayed PANA [RFC5191] is used.

   A PRE can pose certain threats to the relayed PANA messages.  A PRE
   can delay or drop PANA messages sent by the PaC or the PAA.  It can
   also spoof or modify PANA messages sent towards the PaC or the PAA.
   These threats are similar to what an on-path bridge/router (i.e., a
   man-in-the-middle, MitM) can pose to non-relayed PANA.  EAP and PANA
   protocols are designed to operate over unsecure links where
   aforementioned threats can already exist.  Even though these threats
   cannot be leveraged to gain unauthorized network access, or
   compromise of cryptographic keys (e.g., MK, MSK, EMSK, etc.), other
   damages such as preventing authentication to complete, or denial-of
   service are still possible.

   Even though the PRE-to-PAA relay path appears to be a separate
   additional logical link for transporting the PANA messages, the PRE
   may pose a few additional risks versus traditional on-path bridges
   and routers.  The following explains the risks and mitigations of PRE
   as a relay device.

   The PRE inserts PaC-Information AVP as the PaC-generated PANA packet
   is encapsulated in a PRY packet to the PAA.  This AVP carries the IP
   address and the UDP port number values of the PANA packet as sent by
   the PAC.  These values are already carried inside the IP and UDP
   headers with non-relayed PANA and they are not necessarily secured.
   EAP and PANA are designed to work in the absence of their protection.
   Therefore, no additional PANA-layer security is needed when these
   values are carried as PANA AVPs between the PRE and the PAA.  If a
   future document defines additional payload AVPs for the PRY messages,
   there may be a need to define additional security for those messages.

   A rogue PRE can spoof PANA messages on behalf of a victim PaC and
   receive the PAA response irrespective of the location of the PRE with
   respect to the network topology.  Achieving the same threat with non-
   relayed PANA requires the rogue node be a MitM, otherwise the spoofed



Duffy, et al.            Expires August 8, 2011                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             PANA Relay Element              February 2011


   packets may be dropped by the ingress filtering network elements, or
   the responses would be directly sent to the victim PaC IP address and
   may not be received by the rogue node.  Nevertheless, such a rogue
   PRE cannot perform full initial authentication on behalf of the
   victim PaC unless it also holds the PaC's credentials (including the
   master key).  Furthermore, any spoofed PANA messages after the
   initial authentication will fail the integrity checks at the PAA when
   a key-generating EAP method is used.

   The only state that can change on the PAA upon a rogue PRE sending a
   spoofed PRY is the IP address and UDP port number of the PRE stored
   as PANA session attributes, which impacts where the PAA sends the
   next PANA packet (i.e., to the rogue PRE instead of the legitimate
   PRE).  The PAA also needs to handle the PaC-Information AVP in
   addition to the PaC-originated PANA message carried in the Relayed-
   Message AVP, so use of the PRE may impose additional storage
   requirements on the PAA.  A rogue PRE generating a valid PANA packet
   requires it be a MitM in order to synch up with the PANA session
   state and attributes on the PaC.  Such a MitM can already disturb the
   EAP and PANA even without playing the role of a PRE.

   An unauthorized node pretending as PAA can spoof the relayed PANA
   messages to the PRE in order to get them delivered to the PaC.  While
   the harm caused by such spoofed packets are limited (due to the EAP
   and PANA design with unsecured network operation in mind), processing
   of bogus packets can cause processing load on the PaC.

   Some of the risks stemming from the aforementioned threats are
   already handled by the EAP and PANA as described.  The residual risks
   shall be mitigated using additional physical or cryptographic
   security in the network hosting the PREs and the PAAs.  Access
   control lists implemented on the PRE, PAA, or intermediary firewalls
   supported by cryptographic or physical authentication/authorization
   are needed for protecting legitimate PRE and PAAs against rogue ones.
   Details of the cryptograhpic mechanisms using IPsec are specified in
   Section 3.  Use of manually configured preshared keys for IPsec
   between PREs and PAAs does not defend against replayed PANA messages.

   PREs do not need to maintain per-PaC state, therefore they are robust
   against resource consumption DoS (Deniable of Service) attacks.

   In the relay operation, the IP address of the PAA that is seen by the
   PaC (i.e., an IP address of the PRE) is different from the IP address
   of the PAA that is seen by the authentication server.  If an EAP
   channel binding solution uses the IP address of the PAA as part of
   channel binding parameters, such a solution must take this into
   account.  Note that the same issue arises even when non-relayed PANA

   facing the PaC and another IP address on the other interface facing
   the authentication server.


7.  IANA Considerations

   As described in Section 4 and Section 5, and following the new IANA
   allocation policy on PANA messages [RFC5872], one Message Type and
   two PANA AVP Codes need to be assigned.  The following is the
   requested assignment.

   o  A Message Type of 5 for PANA-Relay (PRY) message.

   o  A standard AVP Code of 10 for PaC-Information AVP.

   o  A standard AVP Code of 11 for Relayed-Message AVP.
