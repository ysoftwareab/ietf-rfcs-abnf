   Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping/Traceroute for Segment Routing (SR)
Egress Peer Engineering Segment Identifiers (SIDs) with MPLS Data Planes
                   draft-hegde-mpls-spring-epe-oam-06

Abstract

   Egress Peer Engineering (EPE) is an application of Segment Routing to
   Solve the problem of egress peer selection.  The Segment Routing
   based BGP-EPE solution allows a centralized controller, e.g. a
   Software Defined Network (SDN) controller to program any egress peer.
   The EPE solution requires a node to program the PeerNode SID
   describing a session between two nodes, the PeerAdj SID describing
   the link (one or more) that is used by sessions between peer nodes,
   and the PeerSet SID describing an arbitrary set of sessions or links
   between a local node and its peers.  This document provides new sub-
   TLVs for EPE Segment Identifiers (SID) that would be used in the MPLS
   Target stack TLV (Type 1), in MPLS Ping and Traceroute procedures.

1.  Introduction

   Egress Peer Engineering (EPE) as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-central-epe] is an effective
   mechanism to select the egress peer link based on different criteria.
   The EPE-SIDs provide means to represent egress peer links.  Many
   network deployments have built their networks consisting of multiple
   Autonomous Systems either for ease of operations or as a result of
   network mergers and acquisitons.  The inter-AS links connecting the
   two Autonomous Systems could be traffic engineered using EPE-SIDs in
   this case as well.  It is important to be able to validate the
   control plane to forwarding plane synchronization for these SIDs so
   that any anomaly can be detected easily by the operator.

   This document provides Target Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC)
   stack TLV definitions for EPE-SIDs.  Other procedures for mpls Ping
   and Traceroute as defined in [RFC8287] section 7 and clarified by
   [RFC8690] are applicable for EPE-SIDs as well.

2.  Theory of Operation

   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe] provides mechanisms to
   advertise the EPE-SIDs in BGP-LS.  These EPE-SIDs may be used to
   build Segment Routing paths as described in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] or using Path Computation
   Element Protocol (PCEP) extensions as defined in [RFC8664].  Data
   plane monitoring for such paths which consist of EPE-SIDs will use
   extensions defined in this document to build the Taget FEC stack TLV.
   The MPLS Ping and Traceroute procedures MAY be initaited by the head-
   end of the Segment Routing path or a centralized topology-aware data
   plane monitoring system as described in [RFC8403].  The extensions in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] and [RFC8664] do not define
   the details of the SID and such extensions are out of scope for this
   document.  The node initiating the data plane monitoring may acquire
   the details of EPE-SIDs through BGP-LS advertisements as described in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe].  There may be other
   possible mechanisms to learn the definition of the SID from
   controller.  Details of such mechanisms are out of scope for this
   document.

   The EPE-SIDs are advertised for inter-AS links which run e-BGP
   sessions.The procedures to operate e-BGP sessions in a scenario with
   unnumbered interfaces is not very well defined and hence out of scope
   for this document.  During AS migration scenario procedures described
   in [RFC7705] may be in force.  In these scenarios, if the local and
   remote AS fields in the FEC as described in Section 4carries the
   global AS and not the "local AS" as defined in [RFC7705], the FEC
   validation procedures may fail.

3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, [RFC2119], [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  FEC Definitions

   As described in [RFC8287] sec 5, 3 new type of sub-TLVs for the
   Target FEC Stack TLV are defined for the Target FEC stack TLV
   corresponding to each label in the label stack.  If a malformed FEC

   sub-TLV is received, then a return code of 1, "Malformed echo request
   received" as defined in [RFC8029] SHOULD be sent.

   Local BGP Router ID :

   4 octet unsigned integer of the advertising node representing the BGP
   Identifier as defined in [RFC4271] and [RFC6286].

   Remote BGP Router ID :

   Total number of IPV6 local and remote interface address pairs.

   There can be multiple Layer 3 interfaces on which a peerNode SID
   loadbalances the traffic.  All such interfaces local/remote address
   MUST be included in the FEC.

   When a PeerNode SID load-balances over few interfaces with IPv4 only
   address and few interfaces with IPv6 address then the FEC definition
   should list all IPv4 address pairs together followed by IPv6 address
   pairs.

   Local Interface Address :

   In case of PeerNode SID, the interface local address ipv4/ipv6 which
   corresponds to the PeerNode SID MUST be specified.  For IPv4,this

   Confederation.[RFC5065].  The AS number corresponds to the AS to
   which PeerSet SID advertising node belongs to.

   Remote AS Number :

   4 octet unsigned integer representing the Member ASN inside the
   Confederation.[RFC5065].  The AS number corresponds to the AS of the
   remote node for which the PeerSet SID is advertised.

   Advertising BGP Router ID :

   4 octet unsigned integer of the advertising node representing the BGP
   Identifier as defined in [RFC4271] and [RFC6286].

   Receiving BGP Router ID :

   4 octet unsigned integer of the receiving node representing the BGP
   Identifier as defined in [RFC4271] and [RFC6286].

   No.of elements in set:

   Number of remote ASes, the set SID load-balances on.

   PeerSet SID may be associated with a number of PeerNode SIDs and
   PeerAdj SIDs.  Link address details of all these SIDs should be
   included in the peerSet SID FEC so that the data-plane can be
   correctly verified on the remote node.

   Number of IPv4 interface pairs:

   Total number of IPV4 local and remote interface address pairs.

   Number of IPv6 interface pairs:

   Total number of IPV6 local and remote interface address pairs.

   There can be multiple Layer 3 interfaces on which a peerNode SID
   loadbalances the traffic.  All such interfaces local/remote address
   MUST be included in the FEC.

   When a PeerSet SID load-balances over few interfaces with IPv4 only
   address and few interfaces with IPv6 address then the Link address
   TLV should list all IPv4 address pairs together followed by IPv6
   address pairs.

   Local Interface Address :

   In case of PeerNodeSID/PeerAdj SID, the interface local address ipv4/
   ipv6 which corresponds to the PeerNode SID/PeerAdj SID MUST be
   specified.  For IPv4,this field is 4 octets; for IPv6, this field is
   16 octets.  Link Local IPv6 addresses are FFS.

   Remote Interface Address :

   In case of PeerNodeSID/PeerAdj SID, the interface remote address
   ipv4/ipv6 which corresponds to the PeerNode SID/PeerAdj SID MUST be
   specified.  For IPv4,this field is 4 octets; for IPv6, this field is
   16 octets.  Link Local IPv6 addresses are FFS.

5.  EPE-SID FEC validation

   This section augments the section 7.4 of [RFC8287].  When a remote
   ASBR of the EPE-SID advertisement receives the MPLS OAM packet with
   top FEC being the EPE-SID, it SHOuLD perform validity checks on the
   content of the EPE-SID FEC sub-TLV.


      4a. Segment Routing EPE-SID Validation:

    If the Label-stack-depth is 0 and the Target FEC Stack sub-TLV
         at FEC-stack-depth is TBD1 (PeerAdj SID sub-TLV)

            Set the Best-return-code to 10, "Mapping for this FEC is not
            the given label at stack-depth  if any below
            conditions fail:



               o  Validate that the Receiving Node BGP Local AS matches with the remote AS field in the
                  received PeerAdj SID FEC sub-TLV.

               o  Validate that the Receiving Node BGP Router-ID matches with the Remote Router ID field in the
                  received  PeerAdj SID FEC.

               o  Validate that there is a e-BGP session with a peer having local As number and BGP Router-ID as
                  specified in the Local AS number and Local Router-ID field in the received PeerAdj SID FEC sub-TLV.

            Set the Best-return-code to 35 "Mapping for this FEC is not associated with the incoming interface"  (RFC8287) if any below
            conditions fail:

               o  Validate the incoming interface on which the OAM packet was receieved, matches with the remote interface
                  specified in the PeerAdj SID FEC sub-TLV

    Else, if the Target FEC sub-TLV at FEC-stack-depth is TBD2
         (PeerNode SID sub-TLV),

            Set the Best-return-code to 10, "Mapping for this FEC is not
            the given label at stack-depth  if any below
            conditions fail:


               o  Validate that the Receiving Node BGP Local AS matches with the remote AS field in the
                  received PeerNode SID FEC sub-TLV.

               o  Validate that the Receiving Node BGP Router-ID matches with the Remote Router ID field in the
                  received  PeerNode SID FEC.

               o  Validate that there is a e-BGP session with a peer having local As number and BGP Router-ID as
                  specified in the Local AS number and Local Router-ID field in the received PeerNode SID FEC sub-TLV.

            Set the Best-return-code to 35 "Mapping for this FEC is not associated with the incoming interface"  (RFC8287) if any below
            conditions fail:

               o  Validate the incoming interface on which the OAM packet was receieved, matches with the any of the
                  remote interfaces specified in the PeerNode SID FEC sub-TLV

    Else, if the Target FEC sub-TLV at FEC-stack-depth is TBD3
         (PeerSet SID sub-TLV),

            Set the Best-return-code to 10, "Mapping for this FEC is not
            the given label at stack-depth  if any below
            conditions fail:


               o  Validate that the Receiving Node BGP Local AS matches with one of the remote AS field in the
                  received PeerSet SID FEC sub-TLV.

               o  Validate that the Receiving Node BGP Router-ID matches with one of the  Remote Router ID field in the
                  received  PeerSet SID FEC sub-TLV.

               o  Validate that there is a e-BGP session with a peer having local As number and BGP Router-ID as
                  specified in the Local AS number and Local Router-ID field in the received PeerSet SID FEC sub-TLV.

            conditions fail:

6.  IANA Considerations

   New Target FEC stack sub-TLV from the "sub-TLVs for TLV types 1,16
   and 21" subregistry of the "Multi-Protocol Label switching (MPLs)
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping parameters" registry

      PeerAdj SID Sub-TLV : TBD1

      PeerNode SID Sub-TLV : TBD2

      PeerSet SID Sub-TLV : TBD3

7.  Security Considerations

   The EPE-SIDs are advertised for egress links for Egress Peer
   Engineering purposes or for inter-As links between co-operating ASes.
   When co-operating domains are involved, they can allow the packets
   arriving on trusted interfaces to reach the control plane and get
   processed.  When EPE-SIDs which are created for egress TE links where
   the neighbor AS is an independent entity, it may not allow packets
   arriving from external world to reach the control plane.  In such
   deployments mpls OAM packets will be dropped by the neighboring AS
   that receives the MPLS OAM packet.  In MPLS traceroute applications,
   when the AS boundary is crossed with the EPE-SIDs, the FEC stack is
   changed.  [RFC8287] does not mandate that the initiator upon
   receiving an MPLS Echo Reply message that includes the FEC Stack
   Change TLV with one or more of the original segments being popped
   remove a corresponding FEC(s) from the Target FEC Stack TLV in the
   next (TTL+1) traceroute request.  If an initiator does not remove the
   FECs belonging to the previous AS that has traversed, it MAY expose
   the internal AS information to the following AS being traversed in
   traceroute.
