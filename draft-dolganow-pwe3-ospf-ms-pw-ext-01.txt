Internet-Draft   OSPF Extensions for Dynamic MS-PWs      November 2007 
    

    

Abstract 

   Multi-segment pseudowires have been defined to enable emulated layer 
   1 and layer 2 services to be delivered from an IP based packet 
   switched network over a sparse mesh of PSN tunnels and PW control 
   protocol sessions. MS-PWs can be used to scale PW based networks over 
   both a single AS, or between multiple ASs, and there is a particular 
   need to be able to dynamically route MS-PWs through a given AS to 
   reach PEs at or beyond the edge of the AS, where the route of the PW 
   through each AS needs to be automatically determined. 

   This draft proposes extensions to OSPF to enable the automatic 
   advertisement of summarized PW FECs, thus enabling the dynamic 
   routing of MS-PWs across an OSPF domain.

1. Introduction 

   Multi-segment pseudowires have been defined to enable emulated layer 
   2 services to be delivered from an IP based packet switched network 
   over a sparse mesh of PSN tunnels and PW control protocol 
   adjacencies. MS-PWs can be used to scale PW based networks over both 
   a single AS, and multiple ASs. Requirements for MS-PWs are detailed 
   in [8]. 

   A basic approach to MS-PWs, where the switching points are statically 
   placed, is described in [10]. This is extended in [11] to allow the 
   automatic placement of the MS-PWs. This draft uses FEC 129 with AII 
   type II to summarize the PW end points that are reachable through a 
   given PE, and to provide a layer 2 address for the S-PEs. MP-BGP is 
   used to distribute FECs.  

   The use of MP-BGP is primarily focused on scenarios where each PWE3 
   domain is a separate AS, and S-PEs are used to switch PWs between 
   adjacent ASs. MP-BGP; therefore, provides the BGP-enabled T-PE or S-
   PE at the ingress of the AS with reachability information for AIIs at 
   or beyond the border of the AS. This provides sufficient information 
   to dynamically route the PW across the AS when there is a direct PSN 
   tunnel between the ingress and egress S-PE or T-PE. When there is no 
   direct PSN tunnel, a mechanisms must be provided to determine an 
   indirect route for the PW via some intermediate S-PE within an AS 
   domain.  

   A second important case is where MS-PWs are deployed in service 
   provider access and metro networks. Pseudowires in these networks 
   typically span only a single IGP domain or AS. Furthermore, the nodes 
   contain a minimal routing implementation to cut on the operational 
   complexity. In such networks MP-BGP is not typically deployed on MTUs 
   and full MP-BGP functionality may not be required. This prevents 
   methods defined in [11] to be employed; however, the need to be able 
   to dynamically route MS-PWs through these topologies still exists.

   To enable automatic placement of MS-PWs in the above described cases, 
   it is possible to leverage the mechanisms of the PSN IGP to 
   distribute MS-PW endpoint reachability information. This draft 
   proposes extensions to OSPF to enable the automatic advertisement of 
   summarized PW layer 2 addresses within a single AS, thus enabling the 
   automatic placement of MS-PWs across an OSPF domain. The advertised 
   information is used by T-PEs and S-PEs to derive the MS-PW next hop 
   route which is used then to signal the next-hop S-PE or T-PE, as 
   described in [11].

              Figure 1 MS-PW Routing Model for a Single AS 

   Figure 1 illustrates the MS-PW routing model for a single AS. ACs 
   attached to T-PE2 are associated with the OSPF Router_ID or any 
   locally assigned routable address. Each S-PE / T-PE is also assigned 
   its own layer 2 address in the form of an AII as described in [11]. 

   The proposed model requires the existence of  PSN tunnels between T-
   PE/S-PE, S-PE/S-PE and/or S-PE/T-PE. PWs are established on these 
   tunnels using Targeted LDP signaling [11].

   When a PSN tunnel exists and can be used for the establishment of MS-
   PW or it segment, T-PE advertises the set of exterior AIIs reachable 
   via this tunnel. This is done using summarized Type 2 AIIs so that a 
   separate advertisement is not required for every AC reachable via 
   that tunnel. AIIs may be summarized using the aggregation rules for 
   AII Type 2 described in [6]. When an advertisement is received by an 
   S-PE and the S-PE has a PSN tunnel connectivity to the advertising 
   PE, the advertisement is installed in the S-PE's routing information 
   and the S-PE summarizes AIIs at the far end of the tunnel in its own 
   advertisement for propagation in the AS backbone and further 
   propagation into other areas.. When an advertisement is received by a 
   T-PE and the T-PE has a PSN tunnel connectivity to the advertising 
   PE, the advertisement is installed in the PE's routing information.  
   Alternatively to the above summarization-based population of an 
   advertisement at S-PEs, a static, through configuration, method may 
   be employed at the S-PE to populate AIIs reachable through it.  

   Based on the information advertised, each PE builds a routing 
   information base containing all exterior AIIs reachable through a 
   given next hop S-PE. When creating an MS-PW, the PE looks up the AII 
   and determines the next hop S-PE or T-PE for LDP signalling as 
   described in [11]. 

   Figure 1 depicts the simple model of one-to-one relations of a T-PE 
   to S-PE and S-PE to S-PE, and of a single S-PE to S-PE segment. In 
   the general case, multiple S-PE segments will exist, and the relation 
   between two S-PEs or/and T-PE and S-PEs will be one-to-many or many-
   to-one. Processing in these cases follows that of the general case 
   illustrated in Figure 1. Selection of an S-PE from a set of multiple 
   available next-hop S-PEs may be achieved by comparing the IGP metrics 
   for the route to the terminating T-PE (TT-PE) via each of these next-
   hop S-PEs.  

2. Applicability 

   The proposed OSPF protocol extensions are intended for domains where 
   MP-BGP is not used and/or where only a partial mesh of PSN tunnels 
   exists. In many cases, this will apply to routing MS-PWs across a 
   single AS, where the source T-PE (ST-PE), the Terminating T-PE (TT-
   PE) and all of the intermediate S-PEs reside in the same AS.  

   However, the above application may also be used where OSPF is used to 
   route one portion of a MS-PW across a given AS where the ST-PE and 
   the TT-PE reside in different ASs. Here, OSPF is used to advertise 
   the AIIs reachable through S-PEs corresponding to ASBRs. This enables 
   the ingress S-PEs and intermediate S-PEs in an AS to route MS-PWs to 
   the correct egress S-PE in the AS to reach a TT-PE in another AS.

   This draft does not define how the egress S-PE learns what AIIs are 
   externally reachable through it, but this could be by configuration, 
   or by learning the exterior reachable addresses from an exterior 
   gateway protocol such as BGP.

3.1. Attachment Circuit Addressing 

   As in [11], attachment circuit addressing is derived from AII type 2 
   [2], as shown in the following figure:

   Implementations of this procedure MUST interpret the AII as described 
   in [11].  

3.2. OSPFv2 LSAs 

   This extension makes use of the opaque LSA. 

   One new LSA is defined: the PW Switching LSA. This LSA describes the 
   S-PEs/T-PEs, PSN tunnel(s) between peer S-PEs or T-PEs, and AII 
   addresses reachable. 

3.2.1. Pseudowire Switching LSA 

   OSPFv2 routers behaving as S-PEs or T-PEs advertise the layer 2 
   addresses reachable through them. This advertisement MUST be in an 
   AS-scoped or Area-scoped opaque LSA.  

   The format of the OSPFv2 opaque LSA is as follows:

   The LSA MUST contain a TLV for the IP address of the advertising 
   router. For OSPF v2 routers, this is the Router Address TLV defined 
   in Section 2.4.1 of RFC 3630 [4]. For OSPF v3 routers, this is the 
   Router IPv6 Address TLV specified in Section 3 of draft-ietf-ospf-
   ospfv3-traffic-07.txt [5]. In each of these, the router address MUST 
   be set to the IP address of the advertising T-PE/S-PE. 

3.4.1. Exterior AII TLV 

   The Exterior AII TLV is used to describe addresses attached of 
   attached T-PEs or those routable through S-PEs to T-PEs in another 
   AS. If the LSA information is of type AII, then the value field 
   contains one or more AII Type 2 TLVs, as described above.  

   Exterior AIIs correspond to the AII (or AC) configured on a T-PE, 
   which must contain at least the prefix and global ID to be used in 
   FEC129 for signaling the PW endpoint. The prefix may or may not be 
   directly related to the loopback address of the T-PE. 

 

4. LSA Processing Procedures 

   Nodes capable of pseudowire switching on either side of a PSN tunnel 
   exchange PW switching LSAs with the AII using the PW switching opaque 
   LSA. These PW switching LSAs are processed and flooded as described 
   in Section 4.2.  

    

4.1. P Routers 

   OSPF routers that receive LSAs described in this document and that 
   are not S-PEs or T-PEs MUST flood them according to the rules of 
   OSPFv2 or OSPFv3, as applicable.

4.2. PE Routers 

   S-PEs and T-PEs that are OSPF routers and that receive LSAs described 
   in this document MUST flood them according to the rules of OSPFv2 or 
   OSPFv3, as applicable. These LSAs are also installed in a PW routing 
   database. This routing database MAY be used by S-PEs and T-PEs to 
   calculate a PW routing table. The PW routing table has the structure 
   described in Section 7 of [11], and is used to determine the next 
   signaling hop when a S-PE receives a PW setup message as described in 
   that draft. PW static routes may also be provisioned, as described in 
   [11]. 

   S-PEs that receive LSAs described in this document MAY summarize 
   Exterior AII TLVs received in non-backbone advertisements in that S-
   PEs own backbone advertisement, and MAY summarize Exterior AII TLVs 
   received in backbone advertisements in that S-PEs non-backbone area 
   advertisements. 

   The algorithm used to calculate the PW routing table from the link 
   state database, and the application of routing constraints, is beyond 
   the scope of this draft. However, all T-PEs and S-PEs within the same 
   PWE3 domain SHOULD use the same algorithm. 

    

5. Deployment Considerations 

   Addition and Removal of ACs, S-PEs and T-PEs 

   The operational and deployment considerations for the addition and 
   removal of S-PEs, T-PEs and ACs will be described in a future version 
   of this draft. 

5.1. Impact on Existing P-Routers 

   P-routers supporting Opaque LSA processing procedures must exist 
   along the flooding path in the AS to ensure propagation of the 
   information required for dynamic pseudowire routing. Ideally, 
   multiple "Opaque LSA" flooding paths exist, so a failure of a router 
   along a path does isolate subset of a network. 

   Routers supporting Opaque LSA processing as described in [3], will 
   flood the LSAs as specified in [3]. The impact of this additional 
   flooding load may be constrained through appropriate levels of 
   aggregation of AIIs. Section 5.2.  below describes other methods for 
   limiting the impact of any additional flooding.

5.2. Congestion in the Underlying PSN Routing 

   This document describes the use of the underlying interior gateway 
   protocol in an IP network to advertise routing information for the 
   automatic placement of MS-PWs. Congestion may occur in the routing 
   plane of the PSN if a large amount of pseudowire LSAs are flooded. It 
   is therefore important to ensure that this does not degrade the 
   performance of the IGP for the underlying PSN.  

   Implementations may use a number of methods to avoid routing 
   congestion, including: 

   o Separate IGP instances for the underlying PSN and for the MS-PWs. 

   o Prioritization of PSN LSAs over PW Switching LSAs. 

   o Rate limiting PW Switching LSAs so that they do not consume 
      excessive bandwidth or route processor capacity. 

   o OSPF Refresh and Flooding reduction mechanisms as defined in [7]. 

    

6. Security Considerations 

   This section will be added in a future version. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document requests that the following allocations be made from 
   existing registries: 

   o The OSPFv2 opaque LSA type TBD for the PW switching opaque LSA. 

   o The OSPFv3 LSA type function code TBD for the PW switching LSA
