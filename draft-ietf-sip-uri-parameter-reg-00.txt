Abstract

   This document creates an IANA registry for SIP URI and SIPS URI
   parameters. It also lists the already existing parameters to be used
   as initial values for that registry.

1 Introduction

   RFC3261 [1] allows new SIP URI and SIPS URI parameters to be defined.
   However, RFC3261 omitted an IANA registry for them. This document
   creates such a registry.

2 Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant SIP implementations.

3 Use of the Registry

   RFCs defining SIP URI or SIPS URI parameters MUST register them with
   IANA as described below.

4 IANA Considerations

   Section 27 of RFC 3261 [1] creates an IANA registry for method names,
   header field names, warning codes, status codes, and option tags.
   This specification instructs the IANA to create a new sub-registry
   under http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters:

        o SIP/SIPS URI Parameters

4.1 SIP and SIPS URI Parameters Sub-Registry

   New SIP and SIPS URI parameters are registered by the IANA. When
   registering a new SIP or SIPS parameter, the following information
   MUST be provided.

        o Name of the parameter.

        o Reference to the RFC defining the parameter

   Table 1 contains the initial values for this sub-registry.


5 Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations associated to this document.
