 Distribution of Traffic Engineering Extended Admin Groups using BGP-LS
                   draft-ietf-idr-eag-distribution-14

Abstract

   Administrative groups are link attributes (commonly referred to as
   "colors" or "link colors") advertised by link state protocols (e.g.
   ISIS or OSPF) and used for traffic engineering.  These administrative
   groups were initially defined as 32 bit masks.  As network usage
   grew, these 32 bit masks were found to constrain traffic engineering.
   Therefore, link state protocols (ISIS, OSPF) were expanded to
   advertise a variable length administrative group.This document
   defines an extension to BGP-LS for advertisement of extended
   administrative groups (EAGs) to allow to support a number of
   administrative groups greater than 32, as defined in [RFC7308].

1.  Introduction

   Administrative groups (commonly referred to as "colors" or "link
   colors") are link attributes that are advertised by link state
   protocols like IS-IS [RFC5305], OSPFv2 [RFC3630] and OSPFv3 [RFC5329]
   for traffic engineering use-cases.  The BGP-LS advertisement of the
   originally defined (non-extended) administrative groups is encoded
   using the Administrative Group (color) TLV 1088 as defined in
   [RFC7752].

   These administrative groups are defined as a fixed-length 32-bit
   bitmask.  As networks grew and more use-cases were introduced, the
   32-bit length was found to be constraining and hence extended
   administrative groups (EAG) were introduced in the IS-IS and OSPFv2
   link state routing protocols [RFC7308].

   This document specifies an extension to BGP-LS for advertisement of
   the extended administrative groups.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Advertising Extended Administrative Groups in BGP-LS

   This document defines an extension that enable BGP-LS speakers to
   signal the EAG of links in a network to a BGP-LS consumer of network
   topology such as a centralized controller.  The centralized
   controller can leverage this information in traffic engineering
   computations and other use-cases.  When a BGP-LS speaker is
   originating the topology learnt via link-state routing protocols like
   OSPF or IS-IS, the EAG information of the links is sourced from the
   underlying extensions as defined in [RFC7308].  The BGP-LS speaker
   may also advertise the EAG information for the local links of a node
   when not running any link-state IGP protocol e.g. when running BGP as
   the only routing protocol.

   The EAG of a link is encoded in a new Link Attribute TLV [RFC7752]
   using the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |              Type             |             Length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |    Extended Administrative Groups (variable)                 //
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

            Figure 1: Extended Administrative Groups TLV Format

   Where:

   o  Type: 1173

   o  Length: variable length which represents the total length of the
      value field.  The length value must MUST be multiple of 4.  If the
      length is not a multiple of 4, the TLV must be considered
      malformed.

   o  Value: one or more sets of 32-bit bitmasks that indicate the
      administrative groups (colors) that are enable on the link when
      those specific bits are set.

   The EAG TLV is an optional TLV.  The originally defined AG TLV 1108
   and the EAG TLV 1173 defined in this document MAY be advertised
   together.  The semantics of the EAG and the backward compatibility
   aspects of EAG with respect to the AG are handled as described in the
   Backward Compatibility section of [RFC7308], namely - If a node
   advertises both AG and EAG, then the first 32 bits of the EAG MUST be
   identical to the advertised AG.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests assigning a code-point from the registry "BGP-
   LS Node Descriptor, Link Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute
   TLVs" based on table below.  Early allocation for these code-points
   have been done by IANA.

    +------------+-------------------------------+-------------------+
    | Code Point |   Description                 | IS-IS TLV/Sub-TLV |
    +------------+-------------------------------+-------------------+
    |   1173     | Extended Administrative Group |      22/14        |
    +------------+-------------------------------+-------------------+


4.  Security Considerations

   The extensions in this document advertise same administrative group
   information specified via [RFC7752] but as a larger/extended value
   and hence does not introduce security issues beyond those discussed
   in [RFC7752] and [I-D.ietf-idr-rfc7752bis].
