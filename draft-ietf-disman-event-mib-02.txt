Internet Draft		       Event MIB		21 November 1997


1.  Abstract

This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information
Base (MIB) for use with	network	management protocols in	the Internet
community.  In particular, it describes	managed	objects	used for
managing monitoring of MIB objects and taking action through events.

2.  The	SNMP Network Management	Framework

They are: The SNMP Network Management Framework	presently consists of
three major components.	 They are:

  the SMI, described in	RFC 1902 [1] - the mechanisms used for
  describing and naming	objects	for the	purpose	of management.

  the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] - the core set of managed objects for
  the Internet suite of	protocols.

  the protocol,	RFC 1157 [3] and/or RFC	1905 [4], - the	protocol for
  accessing managed objects.

The Framework permits new objects to be	defined	for the	purpose	of
experimentation	and evaluation.


2.1.  Object Definitions

Managed	objects	are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in	the MIB	are defined
using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the
SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
an administratively assigned name.  The	object type together with an
object instance	serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of
the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,
termed the descriptor, to refer	to the object type.

Internet Draft		       Event MIB		21 November 1997


3.  Overview

This MIB is based heavily on the RMON and Manager-to-Manager MIBs. It
depends	on the services	of the Target, Notification, and Expression
MIBs.

All of this must suit either a relatively powerful manager or mid-level
manager, as well as a somewhat more limited self-managing system.

4.  Known Problems

The error code for a failure comes from	a now non-existent MIB.	 I
suppose	those codes will need to be transplanted here.

The error handling depeds somewhat on notifications and	had assumed the
existence of a logging MIB, which evaporated as	did the	above-mentioned
error codes.

The description	of RMON-like threshold operation is broken and needs to
be changed to be like RMON.

The compliance section is missing.
