Abstract

   This document introduces an extension to Mobile IPv6 to provide 
   support for Localized Mobility Management. This proposed Hop-by-Hop 
   Local Mobility Agents Probing scheme specifies the Local Mobility 
   Agents Discovery, Selection and Failure Detection architecture and 
   procedures for deploying the localized mobility management, whereby 
   the Local Mobility Agents are distributed. It reduces the amount of
   signalling to the home agent and correspondent nodes when mobile 
   node moves among the subnets of the visited domain.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Hop-by-Hop Local Mobility Agents Probing     June 2002


1. Introduction

   In real-time applications, stringent requirements such as delay and
   packet loss are imposed. In order to meet these requirements, Mobile
   IPv6 [1] is facing technical challenges in terms of performance and
   scalability. 

   In Mobile IPv6, every inter-domain binding update sent by the mobile
   node (MN) to its home agent (HA) and correspondent nodes (CNs) to
   inform of its movement to a new Access Router, introduces delay and
   potential packet loss due to the large round-trip time (in the order
   of 300 to 500 ms). In the case of high handoff rate, binding updates
   (BUs) are soon rendered invalid and new ones have to be generated and
   sent to the MN's HA and CNs, which results in a higher signalling
   overhead.

   This document specifies the concept of a Localized Mobility
   Management (LMM) [2] scheme using Hop-by-Hop Local Mobility Agents
   (LMAs) Probing. It is an extension to Mobile IPv6 to provide support
   for regional registration with the LMA Discovery, Selection and
   Failure Detection mechanisms. The main objective is to limit the
   processing of registration for the MN's movement within the visited
   domain locally so as to reduce the network traffic and delay caused
   by the re-registrations with the HA and CNs. When the MN moves into
   the visited domain, a LMA registers with HA on behalf of the MN. As
   MN roams among networks of this domain, only LMA is updated of its
   location, thus avoiding all the signalling traffic towards HA and
   CNs. By its very nature, it also serves as a mechanism to hide MN's
   location from observers outside this domain.


2. Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", AND "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3]. This
   document also uses the terminology described in [1] and [2]. 

   Gateway Local Mobility Agent (GLMA)

      Domain gateway acting as a Local Mobility Agent

   Domain Gateway External Interface (DGEI)

      Any interface on Gateway Local Mobility Agents linked to other
      external domains

   Intermediate Local Mobility Agent

      Any router, excluding the Gateway Local Mobility Agents, in a
      domain, acting as Local Mobility Agent

   Home Domain

      Mobile Node's home network domain

   Visited Domain

      An administrative domain, other than the Home Domain, where Mobile
      Node has moved to 

   Global Care-of Address (GCoA)

      Global IP address of the Local Mobility Agent selected by Mobile
      Node. This Care-of Address is used for registering with Mobile
      Node's Home Agent.

   Local Care-of Address (LCoA)

      A new IP address acquired by Mobile Node when it connects to a
      router in the Visited Domain. This Care-of Address is used for
      registering with the selected Local Mobility Agent.


3. Overview of Hop-by-Hop Local Mobility Agents Probing

3.1. Basic Operation

   The Hop-by-Hop LMAs Probing LMM scheme introduces an extension to
   Mobile IPv6 to reduce the latency due to frequent handoffs between
   access routers in the visited domain as lesser time will be used to
   update a binding locally, than with a distant HA. In addition, BUs to
   all CNs with an existing binding entry for MN would not have to be
   re-generated, which would otherwise result in a relatively high
   signalling overhead.

   For domains, which implement this LMM scheme, domain gateways MUST be
   configured to act as LMAs. This is to identify that the boundary of
   the domain has been reached so that LMAs in other external domains
   will not be mistaken as those in the visited domain. It will also
   ensure that at least one LMA is discovered when MN performs probing
   along the transmission path to its HA. Routers distributed within the
   local mobility domain MAY be configured too for redundancy, which
   could take the place of the Gateway LMAs in the case of node or link
   failure.

   When MN moves into the visited domain initially, it will acquire a
   new Care-of Address (CoA) known here as the Local Care-of Address
   (LCoA). It will then perform probing to search for all the LMAs along
   the transmission path to its HA. The furthest LMA in this visited
   domain will be selected as the LMA to be registered with. The
   decision to select the furthest LMA is to prevent re-registrations
   with HA and CNs when MN performs frequent handoffs within the visited
   domain, resulting in a new LMA being selected.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Hop-by-Hop Local Mobility Agents Probing     June 2002


   After a LMA is selected, MN will register with it to bind its Home
   Address with its Local Care-of Address (LCoA). Therefore, the LMA is
   acting as the HA for MN in this visited domain and MUST have the HA
   functionalities incorporated. After which, MN will use the global IP
   address of this LMA as its Global Care-of Address (GCoA) to register
   with its HA and CNs. From then on, packets intended for MN will be
   sent to the registered LMA, which will tunnel them to MN's LCoA. In
   this way, when MN moves to connect to another Access Router and
   acquire a new LCoA (within the visited domain), only the registered
   LMA needs to be informed.
 
   The details of the extensions to Mobile IPv6 will be presented later
   in this document.

   It SHOULD be noted that this LMM scheme by Hop-by-Hop LMAs Probing is
   simply an extension to the Mobile IPv6 protocol. When it is
   implemented, MN will proceed with registration to the selected LMA,
   and then to its HA and CNs if necessary (i.e. on initial movement to
   visited domain or when re-registration is REQUIRED when LMA changes).
   In the situation whereby this LMM scheme is not implemented, the
   standard Mobile IPv6 procedures are carried out.


3.2. New IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option

   Hop-by-Hop LMAs Probing LMM defines a new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop option [4],
   the LMA Probe option. This option is used to initiate the LMAs
   Discovery process.


3.2.1. LMA Probe Option

   This Hop-by-Hop LMA Probe option is used in an ICMPv6 [5] Echo
   Request packet sent by MN to its HA, to probe for all LMAs along the
   transmission path. This LMA Probe option has the following format:

                                    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                    |  Option Type  | Option Length |

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               

   Option Type

   Option Length

      8-bit unsigned integer. Length of the option, in octets, excluding
      the Option Type and Option Length fields. This field MUST be set
      to 4.

   LMA Probe ID

      The identifier from the LMA Probe message.
   
   Reserved

      16-bit field reserved for future use. The value MUST be
      initialized to zero by the sender, and MUST be ignored by the
      receiver.

   Valid Lifetime

      The minimum value (in seconds) of the preferred and valid
      lifetimes of the prefix assigned to the LMA's subnet. This value
      indicates the validity of the LMA's address and consequently the
      time for which the GCoA is valid. The local binding will be
      updated if there's a change from the registered value.

   LMA IP Address

      The registered LMA's Global Routable Address.


3.4. Modification to Mobile IPv6 Binding Update

   Registration with HA or CN is indicated by the 'H' flag. To
   differentiate registration with LMA, a new flag is added to the
   Binding Update (BU) message in Mobile IPv6. This 'L' flag is used to
   indicate LMA registration. When MN registers with an LMA, the 'L'
   flag MUST be set. The modified Mobile IPv6 Binding Update has the

4. Local Mobility Agents Discovery 

   When MN moves into the visited domain, it will acquire a new Local
   Care-of Address (LCoA). It will then proceed to send an ICMPv6 Echo
   Request message to its HA. This message will include the LMA Probe
   option. The LMA Probe ID is randomly generated and the Counter will
   be set to zero by MN. 

   As this message is transmitted along the route from MN to HA, each
   LMA, which received this message, will process the LMA Probe option.
   The Counter value is incremented by the LMA and a LMA Probe Reply
   message is generated and sent to the soliciting MN. Intermediate
   nodes, which do not recognize this LMA Probe option will skip over it
   and proceed to process other options. Therefore, configuration is
   only REQUIRED on LMAs and MNs. Modification to HAs, CNs and other
   nodes not supporting this LMM scheme is not REQUIRED. 

   When the LMA Probe Option arrives at a Domain Gateway External
   Interface (DGEI), the Counter value in the LMA Probe Option will be
   set to the Boundary Encountered Value of 0xFFFF by the LMA. This is
   to indicate that a boundary is reached. After which, no LMAs SHOULD
   reply to this probing if the Counter in the LMA Probe is found to
   contain this Boundary Encountered Value. This is to ensure that LMAs
   in other domains will not be discovered and mistaken as those in the
   visited domain. The following describes four scenarios of LMAs
   Discovery. In Figure 1, 2 and 3, DGEIs are indicated by the 'X'
   signs.

   In Figure 1, as the LMA Probe Option is transmitted along the route
   from MN to HA, intermediate nodes configured to serve as LMAs will
   trigger the sending of a LMA Probe Reply message to MN. LMA2 will
   send a LMA Probe Reply message to MN with a Counter value of 1, and
   LMA1 will send a LMA Probe Reply message with a Counter value of 2.
   At LMA1's DGEI, the Counter value is set to the Boundary Encountered
   Value of 0xFFFF and no other LMA Probe Reply messages will be sent to
   MN from that point onwards.

   In Figure 3, the LMA Probe Option will be skipped by intermediate
   nodes, not acting as LMAs, and forwarded on to the next node on the
   transmission route. It will then arrive at the DGEI of the LMA(H),
   which will set the Counter value in the LMA Probe Option to the
   Boundary Encountered Value. Therefore, LMA(H) (including LMAs beyond
   it) will not send any LMA Probe Reply message to MN.

   Scenario 4: 
   LMM Scheme not implemented in the visited and external domains

   In the case that this LMM scheme is not implemented in any of the
   domains that the ICMPv6 Echo Request message is sent to, no LMA Probe
   Reply will be received by the MN.


5. Local Mobility Agents Selection and Registration

   When HA receives the ICMPv6 Echo Request message, it will reply with
   an ICMPv6 Echo Reply message. When MN receives the ICMPv6 Echo Reply
   message, which correspond to the ICMPv6 Echo Request message (with
   the LMA Probe option), from the HA, it would check for any LMA Probe
   Reply messages. If no LMA Probe Reply messages are received, the LMM
   scheme is not implemented in the visited domain and MN will proceed
   to perform the standard Mobile IPv6 registrations. If there are LMA
   Probe Reply messages, MN will check their Counter value to locate the
   one with the highest value. This will be the Gateway LMA (GLMA), to
   be selected for registration. The information of the other LMAs

   received in the LMA Probe Reply messages, corresponding to the latest
   LMA Probing, is stored in MN for redundancy purpose (will be
   discussed further in Section 6: Failure Detection).

   To register with the GLMA, MN will send a BU message to this GLMA
   with the LCoA in the Source Address field, the 'L' flag set, the GCoA
   lifetime in the Lifetime field, and the home address of MN in the
   Home Address field. A tunnel [6] will then be set up between the GLMA
   and MN, whereby GLMA will tunnel all packets destined to MN's home
   address to its new LCoA. 

   After receiving a Binding Acknowledgement message from the GLMA, MN
   will send a BU message to its HA. For the inner packet, it will have
   the GCoA in the Source Address field, the HA's address in the
   Destination Address field, and the home address of MN in the Home
   Address field. For the outer packet, it will have the LCoA in the
   Source Address field, and the GCoA in the Destination Address field.
   At the GLMA, it will remove the outer packet and forward the inner
   packet to the HA. Packets destined to MN's home address will be
   intercepted by HA and tunnelled to the GLMA. 

   If MN has existing bindings with CNs (recorded in the Mobile IPv6
   Binding Update List), BU messages to update the bindings will be sent
   through this tunnel. In this case, the Destination Address field of
   the inner packet will hold the CN's address.

   It SHOULD be noted that the lifetime of the binding with
   HA and CNs MUST NOT be larger than the MN's binding lifetime with the
   GLMA.


6. MN's movement within Visited Domain

   When MN moves to connect to a new Access Router within the Visited
   Domain, it will obtain a new LCoA. The LMAs Discovery process is
   therefore triggered. If the currently registered LMA is the same as
   the one selected for registration, a new BU will be sent to this LMA
   to update the registration to bind the GCoA to this new LCoA. The HA
   and other CNs will not be informed as the GCoA still remains the
   same.

   If a different LMA is selected, the BU messages will be sent to this
   LMA, HA, and CNs (if bindings exists in MN's Mobile IPv6 Binding
   Update List) to update the new LCoA and GCoA. The registration
   process is described in Section 5. 


7. Failure Detection

   After sending the Binding Acknowledgement message to MN, the GLMA
   will send a LMA Configuration message to MN. This message includes
   the LMA Alive Notification Interval, which specifies the intervals
  

Thing, Lee, Xu            Expires 21 December 2002             [Page 13]



INTERNET-DRAFT    Hop-by-Hop Local Mobility Agents Probing     June 2002


   that it will send LMA Alive Notification messages to MN. MN will keep
   track of these messages. If one has not been received exceeding the
   Maximum Notification Delay (typically three times the Alive
   Notification Interval, in seconds), MN will deem that a node or link
   failure of the GLMA has occurred. 

   When a failure is detected, the information of the other LMAs
   received in the LMA Probe Reply messages, corresponding to the latest
   LMA Probing, which is stored in MN for redundancy purpose will be
   scanned. This scanning locates the LMA with the next highest Counter
   value (after the previously registered LMA). The LMA registration
   process is triggered to register with this LMA. In the case whereby
   registration with this LMA could not be completed successfully (e.g.
   link failure of the previously registered LMA involves this LMA), the
   scanning process is repeated. If the scanning could not result in
   locating a potential LMA, the LMA Discovery process will then be
   triggered.


8. IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new Hop-by-Hop option and four new IPv6 ICMP
   messages. They MUST be assigned a protocol number. These new
   protocols are described in Section 3.2 and 3.3, and include the
   following:

     Hop-by-Hop Option Type = 32 for LMA Probe Option 

     ICMPv6 Type 143 and 

     ICMPv6 Code = 0 for LMA Probe Reply

     ICMPv6 Code = 1 for LMA Configuration Message

     ICMPv6 Code = 2 for LMA Configuration Acknowledgement Message

     ICMPv6 Code = 3 for LMA Alive Notification Message

   These future values can be allocated using standards action [7].


9. Security Considerations

9.1. Binding Updates to Home Agent

   BU messages from MN to HA will be protected by authentication. The
   inner packet with GCoA in the Source Address field and HA's address
   in the Destination Address field will be protected by including the
   Authentication Header in IPSec. This authentication is based on the
   Security Association between the MN and its HA.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Hop-by-Hop Local Mobility Agents Probing     June 2002


9.2. Binding Updates to Correspondent Nodes

   BU messages from MN to CNs are not protected by the IPSec
   Authentication Header. However, the related security issues in this
   case, is taken care of by the standard Mobile IPv6's Home Test and
   Care-of Test. 

9.3. Placement of Global CoA in inner IPv6 packet by MN

   In the BU messages for HA and CNs, MN is required to place the GCoA
   as the Source Address in the inner packet on behalf of the registered
   LMA (as the source node to forward this packet). A malicious MN might
   send BUs in which the Source Address in the inner packet is set to
   the address of a victim node. If such BUs are accepted, packets are
   forced to be sent to the victim nodes causing a denial of service
   attack.

   This could be prevented by implementing a GCoA <-> Home Address
   binding cache on the registered LMA. When the registered LMA receives
   a BU message for HA or CNs, it will check it's Mobile IPv6 Binding
   Cache and GCoA <-> Home Address Binding Cache, that it does have a
   binding between the GCoA, LCoA, and Home Address in the packet. It
   will then remove the outer packet and forwards the packet on behalf
   of the MN. If the checking shows that it does not have the GCoA,
   LCoA, and Home Address binding, it will reject (the request to
   forward) this packet.

9.4. Proxy support for MN by LMA

   The LMA does not have a security association with MN in this case.
   However, this design does not introduce additional security issues
   existing in IPv6 standard routers.
