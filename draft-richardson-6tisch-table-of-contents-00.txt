Internet-Draft          6tisch-table-of-contents               June 2014


   dependencies on centralized or external functionality, inline and
   offline

3.  time sequence diagram

3.1.  explanation of each step

3.2.  size of each packet

   and number of frames needed to contain it.

4.  resulting security properties obtained from this process

5.  deployment scenarios underlying protocol requirements

6.  device identification

6.1.  PCE/Proxy vs Node identification

6.2.  Time source authentication / time validation

   Note: RPL Root authentication is a chartered item

6.3.  description of certificate contents

6.4.  privacy aspects

7.  slotframes to be used during join

   how is this communicated in the (extended) beacon.

8.  configuration aspects

   (allocation of slotframes after join, network statistics,
   neighboetc.)

9.  authorization aspects

   lifecycle (key management, trust management)

9.1.  how to determine a proxy/PCE from a end node

9.2.  security considerations

   what prevents a node from transmitting when it is not their turn
   (part one: jamming)

   can a node successfully communicate with a peer at a time when not
   supposed to, may be tied to link layer security, or will it be
   policed by receiver?

10.  security architecture

   security architecture and fit of e.g. join protocol and provisioning
   into this

11.  Posture Maintenance

   (SACM related work)

12.  Security Considerations

13.  Other Related Protocols

14.  IANA Considerations

15.  Acknowledgements

16.  Normative references
