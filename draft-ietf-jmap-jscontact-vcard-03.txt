1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   The JSContact specification [draft-ietf-jmap-jscontact] has been
   defined to represent contact card information as a more efficient
   alternative to vCard [RFC6350] and its JSON-based version named jCard
   [RFC7095].

   While new applications might adopt JSContact as their main format to
   exchange contact card data, they are likely to interoperate with
   services and clients that just support vCard/jCard.  Similarly,
   existing contact data providers and consumers already using vCard/
   jCard might want to represent their data also according to the
   JSContact specification.

Internet-Draft               jscontact-vcard                  April 2021


   To facilitate this, this document defines how to convert contact
   information as defined in the JSContact [draft-ietf-jmap-jscontact]
   specification from and to vCard.

1.2.  Scope and Caveats

   JSContact and vCard have a lot of semantics in common, however some
   differences must be outlined:

   o  The JSContact data model defines some contact information that
      doesn't have a direct mapping with vCard properties.  In
      particular, unlike vCard, JSContact distinguishes between a single
      contact card, named JSCard, and a group of contact cards, named
      JSCardGroup.

   o  The properties that can be present multiple times in a vCard are
      represented through different collections in JSContact; mainly as
      maps, sometimes as lists, in some cases condensed in a single
      value.

1.2.1.  Extensions

   While translating vCard properties to JSContact, any vCard property
   that doesn't have a direct counterpart in JSContact MUST be converted
   into a property whose name is prefixed by "ietf.org/<RFC defining the
   extension>/".

   Any custom extension MAY be added and its name MUST be prefixed with
   a specific domain name to avoid conflict, e.g. "example.com/
   customprop".

   Similarly, the reversed rules are applied while translating JSContact
   properties to vCard.

1.3.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In the following of this document, the vCard features, namely
   properties and parameters, are written in uppercase while the JSCard/
   JSCardGroup features are written in camel case wrapped in double
   quotes.

2.  Translating vCard properties to JSContact

   This section contains the translation rules from vCard to JSCard/
   JSCardGroup.  The vCard properties are grouped according to the
   categories as defined in [RFC6350].

2.1.  Common Parameters

   The following mapping rules apply to parameters that are common to
   most of the vCard properties:

   o  The generic values of the TYPE parameter are mapped onto the
      values of the "Context" type as defined in Section 1.5.1 of
      [draft-ietf-jmap-jscontact].  The "home" value corresponds to the
      "private" key.  The mapping of those specific TYPE values used in
      the TEL and RELATED properties are defined in the following of the
      document.

   o  The PREF parameter is mapped onto the "pref" property.

   o  The MEDIATYPE parameter is mapped onto the "mediaType" property.
      As described in Section 5.7 of [RFC6350], the media type of a
      resource can be identified by its URI.  For example, "image/gif"
      can be derived from the ".gif" extension of a GIF image URI.
      JSContact producers MAY provide the media type information even
      when it is not specified in the vCard.

   o  The ALTID and LANGUAGE parameters are used in combination for
      associating the language-dependent alternatives with a given
      property.  Such alternatives are represented by using the
      "localizations" map of a "LocalizedString" member inside the
      matching JSContact object.

   o  The LEVEL parameter as defined in [RFC6715] is directly mapped
      onto the "level" property of the "PersonalInformation" type apart
      from when LEVEL is used in the EXPERTISE property; in this case,
      the values are converted as in the following:

      *  "beginner" is converted into "low";
      *  "average" is converted into "medium";
      *  "expert" is converted into "high".

2.2.  JSContact Id

   The rules to generate a map key of type Id are out of the scope of
   this document.

2.3.  General Properties

2.3.1.  BEGIN and END

   The BEGIN and END properties don't have a direct match with a
   JSContact feature.

2.3.2.  SOURCE

   A SOURCE property is represented as an entry of the "online" map
   (Figure 1).  The entry value is a "Resource" object whose "type"
   member is set to "uri", the "label" member is set to "source" and the
   "resource" member is the SOURCE value.

   The PREF and MEDIATYPE parameters are mapped according to the rules
   as defined in (Section 2.1).

    SOURCE:http://directory.example.com/addressbooks/jdoe/Jean%20Dupont.vcf
    ...

         "resource": "http://directory.example.com/addressbooks/jdoe/Jean%20Dupont.vcf"
       },
       ...
    },
    ...
    }

                     Figure 1: SOURCE mapping example

2.3.3.  KIND

   The KIND property is mapped onto the "kind" member (Figure 2).
   Allowed values are those described in Section 6.1.4 of [RFC6350] and
   extended with the values declared in [RFC6473] and [RFC6869].  The
   value "group" is reserved for a JSCardGroup instance.

       "kind": "individual",
       ...
       }

                      Figure 2: KIND mapping example

2.3.4.  XML

   The XML property doesn't have a direct match with a JSContact
   feature.

2.4.  Identification Properties

2.4.1.  FN

   All the FN instances are globally represented through the "fullName"
   member.  The presence of multiple instances is implicitly associated
   with the full name translations in various languages regardless of
   the presence of the ALTID parameter.  Each translation corresponds to
   a different entry of the "localizations" map (Figure 3).

2.4.2.  N and NICKNAME

   The N instances are converted into equivalent items of the "name"
   array (Figure 3): the N components are transformed into related
   "NameComponent" objects as presented in Table 1.  Name components
   SHOULD be ordered such that their values joined by whitespace produce
   a valid full name of this entity.

   Each NICKNAME instance is mapped onto an item of "nickNames" array.

2.4.3.  PHOTO

   A PHOTO property is represented as an entry of the "photos" map
   (Figure 4).  The entry value is a "File" object whose "href" member
   is the PHOTO value.

   The PREF and MEDIATYPE parameters are mapped according to the rules
   as defined in (Section 2.1).

2.4.4.  BDAY, BIRTHPLACE, DEATHDATE, DEATHPLACE, ANNIVERSARY

   The BDAY and ANNIVERSARY properties and the extensions BIRTHPLACE,
   DEATHDATE, DEATHPLACE described in [RFC6350] are represented as
   "Anniversary" objects included in the "anniversaries" array
   (Figure 5):

   o  BDAY and BIRTHPLACE are mapped onto "date" and "place" where
      "type" is set to "birth";

   o  DEATHDATE and DEATHPLACE are mapped onto "date" and "place" where
      "type" is set to "death";

   o  ANNIVERSARY is mapped onto "date" where "type" is set to "other"
      and "label" is set to a value describing in detail the kind of
      anniversary (e.g. "marriage date" for the wedding anniversary).

   Both birth and death places are represented as instances of the

2.7.  Geographical Properties

   The GEO and TZ properties are not directly mapped onto topmost
   JSCard/JSCardGroup members because the same information is
   represented through equivalent "Address" members.

   The ALTID parameter is used for associating both GEO and TZ
   properties with the related address information.  When the ALTID
   parameter is missing, the matched members SHOULD be included in the
   first "Address" object.

2.7.1.  Time Zone Representation

   As specified in Section 6.5.1 of [RFC6350], the time zone information
   can be represented in three ways: as a time zone name, as a UTC
   offset or as a URI.

   o  The time zone name is directly matched by the "timeZone" member in
      JSContact.

   o  An UTC offset MUST be converted into the related "Etc/GMT" time
      zone (e.g. the value "-0500" converts to "Etc/GMT+5").  If the UTC
      offset value contains minutes information, it MUST be mapped to
      the zone "Etc/GMT<sign><hour>:<minute>".

   o  Since there is no URI scheme defined for time zones [uri-schemes],
      any implementation that does use some a custom URI for a time zone
      is not interoperable anyway.  In this case, if the URI corresponds
      to an IANA time zone [time-zones], this latter SHOULD be used.
      Otherwise, the URI value is dumped into a string.

2.8.  Organizational Properties

2.8.1.  TITLE and ROLE

   Both TITLE and ROLE properties are represented as entries of the
   "titles" map (Figure 11).  The entry value is a "Title" object whose
   "title" member includes information about the language.

   The ALTID and LANGUAGE parameters are mapped according to the rules
   as defined in (Section 2.1).  The "title.localizations" includes
   possible language-dependent alternatives.

2.13.  vCard Unmatched Properties

   The unmatched vCard properties MAY be converted into JSContact
   properties whose name contains the prefix "ietf.org/RFC6350/"
   followed by property name in uppercase (i.e. ietf.org/RFC6350/
   GENDER").

2.14.  JSCard Required Properties

   While converting a vCard into a JSCard/JSCardGroup, only the topmost
   "uid" member is mandatory.  Implementers are REQUIRED to set it when
   it is missing.

3.  Translating JSContact properties to vCard

   In most of the cases, the rules about the translation from JSCard/
   JSCardGroup to vCard can be derived by reversing the rules presented
   in Section 2.  The remaining cases are treated in the following of
   this section.

3.1.  Id

   Where a map key is of type Id, implementers are free to either ignore
   it or preserve it as a vCard information (e.g. a vCard parameter).

3.2.  Localizations

   A LocalizedString object is converted in multiple instances of the
   same vCard property having different values of the LANGUAGE
   parameter.  Implementers MAY set the ALTID parameter to couple
   language-based alternatives of the same value.

   Note also that the components of some vCard values and their related
   alternatives are split into different JSContact values.  For example,
   the "name" and "units" values for a given language must be grouped to
   make a single ORG value where components are separated by ";".

3.3.  Date and Time Representations

   The JSContact spec defines the "UTCDateTime" type to represent
   [RFC3339] "date-time" format with further restrictions.  This means
   that the matched vCard format for a "UTCDateTime" value MUST be one
   of the formats shown in Section 4.3.5 of [RFC6350] (i.e.
   "19961022T140000Z").

   In addition to such format, the "date" member of the "Anniversary"
   type allows specifying both a date without the time and a partial
   date.  In this case, the corresponding vCard format is that defined
   in Section 4.3.1.

3.4.  Time Zone

   The time zone name as represented by the "timeZone" property is
   mapped onto the TZ parameter.

   Implementers MAY map an "Etc/GMT" time zone either preserving the
   time zone name or converting it into a UTC offset.

3.5.  JSContact Types Matching Multiple vCard Properties

3.5.1.  Title

   The "titles" property contains information about the job, the
   position or the role of the entity the card represents.  In vCard,
   such information is split into the TITLE and ROLE properties.  This
   specification defines TITLE as the default target property when
   converting the "titles" property.

3.5.2.  Resource

   The "online" property includes resources that are usually represented
   through different vCard properties.  The matched vCard property of a
   "Resource" object can be derived from the value of its "label"
   member.

   Any resource included in the "online" map that doesn't match a vCard
   property MAY be converted into vCard extended properties.

3.6.  JSCard Unmatched Properties

   Both the "preferredContactMethod" and "created" members don't match
   any vCard property.  Implementers MAY represent them as vCard
   extended properties.

3.7.  vCard Required Properties

   While converting a JSCard/JSCardGroup into a vCard, only the FN
   property is required.  Since the "fullName" property is optional,
   implementers are REQUIRED to generate an FN value when it is missing.

5.  Implementation Status

   NOTE: Please remove this section and the reference to RFC 7942 prior
   to publication as an RFC.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol as defined in this specification at the time of posting of
   this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
   [RFC7942].  The description of implementations in this section is
   intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing
   drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual
   implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.

   Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information
   presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not
   intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available
   implementations or their features.  Readers are advised to note that
   other implementations may exist.

   According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due considerationto documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".
