               P-Access-Network-Info in SIP ACK requests
               draft-holmberg-dispatch-rfc7315-updates-00

Abstract

   The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project 3GPP has identified cases
   where different SIP private header extensions referred to as P-
   header fields, defined in RFC 7315, need to be included in SIP
   requests and responses currently not allowed according to RFC 7315.
   This document updates RFC 7315, in order to allow inclusion of the
   affected P- header fields in such requests and responses.

   In order to get a complete picture, this document also contains a set
   of errata that are to be filed against RFC 7315, in order to fix
   misalignments that occurred when RFC 3455 was updated and obsoleted
   by RFC 7315.

1.  Introduction

   The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has identified cases
   where different Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] private
   header extensions referred to as P- header fields, defined in RFC
   7315 [RFC7315], need to be included in SIP requests and responses
   currently not allowed according to RFC 7315.  This document updates
   RFC 7315, in order to allow inclusion of the affected P- header
   fields in such requests and responses.

   In order to get a complete picture, this document also contains a set
   of errata that are to be filed against RFC 7315, in order to fix
   misalignments that occurred when RFC 3455 [RFC3455] was updated and
   obsoleted by RFC 7315.

   This document updates RFC 7315 [RFC7315], by allowing the insertion
   of the P-Access-Network-Info header field in SIP ACK requests.

   As the P- header fields are mainly used in (and in most cases, only
   defined for) networks defined by the 3rd-Generation Partnership
   Project (3GPP), where the updates defined in this document are

Internet-Draft                7315 Updates                 December 2015


   already defined [TS.3GPP.24.229], the updates are not seen to cause
   backward compatibility concerns.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Errata to RFC 7315

3.1.  General

   RFC 7315 contains contradicting statements regarding the usage of SIP
   P- header fields in SIP requests and responses, which leave the
   presence of the SIP P- header fields in the SIP requests and
   responses open to interpretation, and different implementations.
   Statements in section 5.7 are not aligned with the definitions and
   usage of the SIP P- header fields specified in section 4.

   This section defines the errata that is to be submitted against RFC
   7315.  The scope of the errata is only alignment between RFC 3455 and
   RFC 7315.

   NOTE: In the case of the P-Called-Party-ID header field, allowing it
   in PUBLISH requests was deliberately done in RFC 7315.  It will
   therefore not be impacted by the errata.

3.2.  Correction to section 5.7 of RFC 7315

   The errata makes the following changes:

   o  P-Associated-URI: Remove statement that the header field can
      appear in the SIP REGISTER method.

   o  P-Called-Party-ID: Delete statement that the header field can
      appear in SIP responses.  Add statement that the P-Called-Party-ID
      header field can appear in the SIP REFER method.

   o  P-Visited-Network-ID: Delete statement that the header field can
      appear in SIP responses.  Add statement that the P-Visited-
      Network-ID header field cannot appear in the SIP NOTIFY, PRACK,
      INFO and UPDATE methods.

   o  P-Access-Network-Info: Add statement that header field can appear
      in SIP responses.

Internet-Draft                7315 Updates                 December 2015


   o  P-Charging-Vector: Add statement that the header field can appear
      in SIP responses.  Add statement that the header field can not
      appear in the SIP ACK method.

   o  P-Charging-Function-Addresses: Add statement that the P-Charging-
      Function-Addresses header field can appear in SIP responses.


Old text:

5.7.  New Headers

   The P-Associated-URI header field can appear in SIP REGISTER method
   and 2xx resonses.  The P-Called-Party-ID header field can appear in
   SIP INVITE, OPTIONS, PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, and MESSAGE methods and all
   responses.  The P-Visited-Network-ID header field can appear in all
   SIP methods except ACK, BYE, and CANCEL and all responses. The
   P-Access-Network-Info header field can appear in all SIP methods
   except ACK and CANCEL.  The P-Charging-Vector header field can appear
   in all SIP methods except CANCEL.  The P-Charging-Function-Addresses
   header field can appear in all SIP methods except ACK and CANCEL.
