Internet-Draft               LCP Policy URIs                October 2009


1.  Introduction

   A critical step in enabling Internet hosts to access location-based
   services is to provision those hosts with information about their own
   location.  This is accomplished via a Location Configuration Protocol
   (LCP) [7], which allow a location provider (e.g., a local access
   network) to inform a host about its location.

   There are two basic patterns for location configuration, namely
   configuration "by value" and "by reference" [8].  Configuration by
   value provisions a host directly with its location, by providing it
   location information that is directly usable (e.g., coordinates or a
   civic address).  Configuration by reference provides a host with a
   URI that references the host's location, i.e., one that can be
   dereferenced to obtain the location (by value) of the host.

   In some cases, location by reference offers a few benefits over
   location by value.  From a privacy perspective, the required
   dereference transaction provides a policy enforcement point, so that
   the opaque URI itself can be safely conveyed over untrusted media
   (e.g., SIP through untrusted proxies [9]).  If the target host is
   mobile, an application provider can use a single reference to obtain
   the location of the host multiple times, saving bandwidth to the
   host.  For some configuration protocols, the location object
   referenced by a location URI provides a much more expressive syntax
   for location values than the configuration protocol itself (e.g.,
   DHCP geodetic location [10] versus GML in a PIDF-LO [11]).

   From a privacy perspective, however, current LCPs are limited in
   their flexibility, in that they do not provide the Target (the client
   in an LCP) with a way to inform the Location Server with policy for
   how his location information should be handled.  This document
   addresses this gap by defining a simple mechanism for referring to
   and manipulating policy, and by extending current LCPs to carry
   policy references.  Using the mechanisms defined in this document, a
   Location Server (acting as an LCP server) can inform a client as to
   which policy document controls a given location resource, and the LCP
   client (a Target and Rule Maker) can inspect this document and modify
   it as necessary.

   The remainder of this document is structured as follows: After
   introducing a few relevant terms, we define policy URIs as a channel
   for referencing, inspecting, and updating policy documents.  We then
   define extensions to HELD protocol and the DHCP option for location
   by reference to allow these protocols to cary policy URIs.  Examples
   are given that demonstrate how policy URIs are carried in these
   protocols and how they can be used by clients.

2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


3.  Policy URIs

   A policy URI is an HTTP or HTTPS URI that a Rule Holder can use to
   inspect and install policy documents that tell a location server how
   it should protect a given location resource.  A policy URI is always
   a reference to a common-policy document [2] (possibly including some
   extensions, e.g., for geolocation policy [3]).

   A server that is the authority for policy URIs MUST support GET, PUT,
   and DELETE requests to these URIs, in order to allow clients to
   inspect, replace, and delete policy documents.  While the server MAY
   deny any particular request according to local policy, it SHOULD
   allow all requests (with any of the three methods) from the Target of
   the protected location resource.  Clients MUST likewise support the
   three required request types.

   A GET request to a policy URI is a request for the referenced policy
   information.  In response to a GET request, the server MUST validate
   that the requestor is an authorized Rule Maker or Rule Holder
   according to local policy.  If the request is valid, then the server
   MUST send an HTTP 200 response containing the full policy document
   referenced by the URI, in the common-policy format; these responses
   MUST have content-type 'application/auth-policy+xml'.

   A PUT request to a policy URI is a request to replace the current
   policy.  The entity-body of a PUT requests MUST be a common-policy
   document; it must have content-type 'application/auth-policy+xml'.
   When a server receives a PUT request, it MUST validate the policy
   document included in the body of the request, and it MUST validate
   that the requestor is an authorized Rule Maker or Rule Holder
   according to local policy.  If the request is valid, then the server
   MUST replace the current policy document referenced by the URI with
   the policy document provided in the request.

   A DELETE request to a policy URI is a request to delete the
   referenced policy document and terminate access to the protected
   resource.  In response to a DELETE request, the server MUST validate
   that the requestor is an authorized Rule Maker or Rule Holder
   according to local policy.  If the request is valid, then the server
   MUST delete the policy document referenced by the URI and disallow
   any further access to the location resource it governs.

   It should be noted that this usage of HTTP is generally compatible
   with the use of XCAP or WebDAV to manage policy documents, but this
   document does not define or require the use of these protocols.


4.  Location Configuration Extensions

   Location configuration protocols can provision hosts with location
   URIs that refer to the host's location.  If the target host is to
   control policy on these URIs, it needs a way to access the policy
   that the server will use to guide its interactions.  This section
   defines extensions to LCPs to carry policy URIs that the target can
   use to control access to location resources.

4.1.  HELD

   The HELD protocol [4] provides <locationUriSet> elements, which
   contain a set of one or more location URIs that reference the same
   resource and share a common access control policy.  The schema in
   Figure Figure 1 defines an extended <locationUriSet> object with a
   new optional attribute "policy"

Internet-Draft               LCP Policy URIs                October 2009


   The URI carried in a "policy" attribute refers to the common access
   control policy for the location URIs in the <locationUriSet>.  The
   URI MUST be a policy URI as described in Section Section 3: It MUST
   be an HTTP or HTTPS URI, and the server MUST support the specified
   operations on the URI.

4.2.  DHCP

   The DHCP location by reference option [5] provides location URIs in
   sub-options called LuriElements.  This document defines a new
   LuriElement type for policy URIs

   LuriType=X   Policy-URI - This is a policy URI that refers to the
              access control policy for the location URI in the
              preceding LuriElement.

   [NOTE TO IANA/RFC-EDITOR: Please replace X above with the assigned
   LuriType value]

   Each Policy-URI LuriElement MUST immediately follow a sub-option that
   carries a location URI, for example, a sub-option with LuriType 1.
   The URI carried in a Policy-URI LuriElement refers to the access
   control policy for the location URI in the sub-option that precedes
   it.  The URI MUST be a policy URI as described in Section Section 3:
   It MUST be an HTTP or HTTPS URI, and the server MUST support the
   specified operations on the URI.


5.  Examples

   In this section, we provide some brief illustrations of how policy
   URIs are delivered to target hosts and used by those hosts to manage
   policy

5.1.  HELD

   A HELD response providing a single <locationUriSet>, containing two
   URIs under a common policy, would have the following form:

5.3.  Basic access control policy

   Consider a user that gets the policy URI <https://ls.example.com/>,
   as in the above LCP example.  The first thing this allows the user to
   do is inspect the default policy that the LS has assigned to this
   URI:

   This policy allows all users in the domain "example.com" to access
   the bound location URI, except for users "alice" and "bob".  If the
   user disagrees with this policy, and prefers for example, to only
   provide location to one friend, at a city level of granularity, then
   he can install this policy on the LS:

   Finally, after using the URI for a period, the user wishes to
   permanently invalidate the URI.

8.  Security Considerations

   There are two main classes of risks associated with access control
   policy management: The risk of unauthorized disclosure of the
   protected resource via manipulation of the policy management process,
   and the risk of disclosure of policy information itself.

   Protecting the policy management process from manipulation entails
   two primary requirements: First, the policy URI has to be faithfully
   transmitted to the client, and second, the policy document has to be
   faithfully transmitted to the location server.  The first requirement
   is met by the integrity properties of the underlying LCP.  To meet
   the second requirement, the LCP server SHOULD provide HTTPS policy
   URIs and the policy server SHOULD support cipher suites that provide
   integrity protection.

   Authorization policy at the policy server also plays a central role
   in the protection of both location information and user policy
   information.  In order to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of
   location information and policyinformation, the policy server MUST
   authenticate all requests to policy URIs and verify that the
   requestor is an authorized Rule Maker for the protected location
   resource.  In the particular case where the target itself is an
   authorized Rule Maker and the target is identified to the LS by its
   IP address, the server MAY use IP return routability as an
   authentication mechanism.

   Finally, policy information must be protected from observation by
   unauthorized entities en route between the client and the policy
   server.  This protection is provided by the use of HTTPS with
   appropriate cipher suites.
