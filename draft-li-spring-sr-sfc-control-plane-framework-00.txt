A Framework for Constructing Service Function Chaining Systems Based on
                            Segment Routing
           draft-li-spring-sr-sfc-control-plane-framework-00

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end
   paths by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths, called
   "segments".  Segment routing architecture can be implemented over an
   MPLS data plane as well as an IPv6 data plane.

   Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides support for the creation of
   composite services that consist of an ordered set of Service
   Functions (SF) that are to be applied to packets and/or frames
   selected as a result of classification.

   SFC can be implemented based on several technologies, such as Network
   Service Header (NSH) and SR.  This document describes a framework for
   constructing SFC based on Segment Routing.  The document reviews the
   control plane solutions for route distribution of service function
   instance and service function path,and steering packets into a
   service function chain.

1.  Introduction

   Segment routing (SR) [RFC8402]is a source routing paradigm that
   explicitly indicates the forwarding path for packets at the ingress
   node by inserting an ordered list of instructions, called segments.
   When segment routing is deployed on MPLS dataplane, it is called SR-
   MPLS [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls].  When segment routing is
   deployed on IPv6 dataplane, it is called SRv6
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header].

Internet-Draft         SR based SFC Control Plane              June 2019


   Service Function Chaining (SFC) [RFC7665] provides an architecture
   that supports the creation of composite service instances that
   consist of an ordered set of Service Functions (SF) that are to be
   applied to packets and/or frames selected as a result of
   classification.

   SFC can be implemented based on Network Service Header [RFC8300].  In
   NSH-based SFC, per-SFC state, such as a mapping between Service Path
   ID (SPI) and Service Index (SI) to next-hop forwarding, needs to be
   maintained on nodes along the service function path, and it can
   therefore be termed as "stateful SFC".
   [I-D.ietf-bess-nsh-bgp-control-plane] defines the use of BGP as a
   control plane for networks that support Service Function Chaining
   (SFC) based on NSH and MPLS.  The document introduces a new BGP
   address family called the SFC AFI/SAFI with two route types: Service
   Function Instance Route (SFIR) and Service Function Path Route
   (SFPR).  A NSH or MPLS based SFC can be constructed based on the
   information of SFIR and SFPR.

   SFC can also be instantiated based on SR.  In SR, the forwarding path
   is explicitly encoded into the packets on the SR source node.  In SR-
   based SFC, an SFC can be represented by a SID list explicitly
   indicated by the source SR node.  The SID in SID list may need to be
   associated with service information in order to indicate network
   service, such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI).  Therefore, no per-SFC
   state needs to be maintained along with the service function path,
   and it can therefore be termed "stateless SFC".

   In order to construct SR-based SFC, several mechanisms are proposed,
   including the mechanisms of Service Function Instance Route(SFIR) and
   Service Function Path Route(SFPR) distribution, as well as the
   mechanism of steering packets into an SFP.  This document reviews
   these solutions to describe a framework for the construction of a
   service function chaining system based on Segment Routing.

2.  Overview of SR Based SFC Control Plane

   As per [RFC7665], the architecture of SFC consists of classifiers,
   Service Function Forwarders (SFFs), Service Functions (SFs) and SFC
   proxies, see Figure 1.

                        Figure 1. SFC Architecture


   In order to construct a service function chain, SFIR and SFPR should
   be distributed to classifiers and SFFs.  Also, the rules of steering
   packets into specific service function paths should be configured at
   the classifier.  [I-D.ietf-bess-nsh-bgp-control-plane].

   In SR, a source node can explicitly indicate the forwarding path for
   packets by inserting an ordered list of instructions.  These packets
   steering policies, known as SR policy, can be installed by a central
   controller via BGP [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy] or other
   mechanisms.

   When SFC is constructed based on SR, SFPR and pakcet steering rules
   can be installed by SR policy at the ingress node, which plays the
   role of classifier in the SFC architecture.  In other words, SFPR
   does not need to be distributed to all the nodes along the service
   function path.  The architecture of SR based SFC is illustrated in
   Figure 2.

   o  CF/SR ingress: an SR ingress node plays the role of Classifier in
      the SFC architecture, and it connects to an SR controller, where
      the SR policies originate.

   o  SR-C: SR Controller (SR-C) is connected to the SR ingress node,
      and may be attached to any node in the network.  SR-C is capable
      of discovering topology, and calculating constrained paths for
      service function chains.

   o  SFF/SR nodes: the SFF component in SFC architecture, which enables
      SR to steer packets to SFs.

   o  SFn: Service Functions, can be SR-aware or SR-unaware.  If an SF
      is SR-unaware then SR proxy is needed.

   o  SR proxy: A proxy between SR nodes/SFF and SR-unaware SF.

   There are two solutions to encode SFC in the SR data plane.
   [I-D.xuclad-spring-sr-service-programming] defines data plane
   functionality required to implement service segments and achieve
   service programming in SR-enabled MPLS and IP networks.  It can be
   termed "Stateless SFC" since no per-SFC state is maintained on the SR
   nodes along the service function path.

Internet-Draft         SR based SFC Control Plane              June 2019


   The second solution can be termed "Stateful
   SFC"[I-D.guichard-spring-nsh-sr], since it still maintains per-SFC
   state on nodes.  [I-D.guichard-spring-nsh-sr]describes two modes:

   o  NSH-based SFC with SR-based transport tunnel: SR is used as
      transport tunnel to route packets between classifier and SFF or
      SFFs.  Service plane routing relies on NSH.

   o  SR-based SFC with Integrated NSH Service Plane: The Service
      Function Path is encoded within the SR segment-list, while the NSH
      only maintains the service plane context information, which will
      be used at NSH-aware SFs, and at SFFs for caching of SR segment-
      lists.

   In order to support these data plane encodings, control plane
   mechanisms are required.  The existing control plane mechanisms are
   shown in table 1.

3.  Stateless SR Based SFC

   As describe in [I-D.xuclad-spring-sr-service-programming], service
   instances are associated with a segment, called a service SID.  These
   service SIDs are leveraged as part of a SID-list to steer packets
   through the corresponding services.

3.1.  Service Function Instance Route Distribution

   To associate a segment with a service, service information, such as
   Service Function Type(SFT), should be included in segment
   distribution.

   To associate a segment with a service, service information, such as
   Service Function Type (SFT), should be included in segment
   distribution.  [I-D.dawra-idr-bgp-ls-sr-service-segments] specifies
   the extensions to BGP-LS for discovery and advertisement of service
   segments so as to enable setup of service programming paths using
   Segment Routing.  [I-D.dawra-idr-bgp-ls-sr-service-segments]extends
   SRv6 Node SID TLV [I-D.dawra-idr-bgpls-srv6-ext] and SR-MPLS SID/
   Label TLV [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-ls-segment-routing-ext] to associate the
   Service SID Value with Service-related Information using Service
   Chaining Sub-TLV.  The Service Chaining Sub-TLV contains information
   of Service SID value, Function Identifier (Static Proxy, Dynamic
   Proxy, Shared Memory Proxy, Masquerading Proxy, SR Aware Service
   Etc.), Service Type (DPI, Firewall, Classifier, LB etc.), Traffic
   Type (IPv4 OR IPv6 OR Ethernet) and Opaque Data (such as brand and
   version, other extra information).  This extension works for both SR-
   MPLS and SRv6.

   [I-D.ietf-bess-nsh-bgp-control-plane] proposes a BGP-based SFC
   control plane solution, and it works for SR-MPLS as well.  Service
   function instance route distribution can use SFIR in SFC AFI/SAFI.
   SFPR and steering rules for the classifier can be distributed by SR
   policy, which is defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].
   BGP control plane of SRv6-based SFC still needs to be defined.

   IGP extensions are proposed by [I-D.xu-isis-service-function-adv] and
   [I-D.xu-ospf-service-function-adv]. . In IS-IS solution, SFFs within
   the SFC domain need to advertise each SF they are offering by using a
   new sub-TLV of the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV [RFC4971].  This new
   sub-TLV is called Service Function sub-TLV, and it can appear
   multiple times within a given IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV or when
   more than one SF needs to be advertised.  OSPF extensions are
   similar, and use the OSPF Router Information (RI) Opaque LSA
   [RFC4970] to carry Service Function sub-TLV.

   However, due to IGP flooding issues, IGP extensions are not very
   appropriate, and the drafts have expired for a long time.

3.2.  Service Function Path Route Distribution

   With SR, the SFPR does not need to be distributed to nodes along the
   SFP but only to the ingress node.  SFPR and steering rules for the
   classifier can be distributed by SR policy.  The BGP extension is

   defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].  The PCEP
   extension is defined in [I-D.barth-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp].

3.3.  Steer Packets into SFC

   In SR, packet steering rules are learned through SR policy.  Thus,
   there is no need to install other rules in the classifier, which is
   the SR source node.

4.  Stateful SR Based SFC

   "Stateful SFC" [I-D.guichard-spring-nsh-sr]proposes two modes of SR
   based SFC:

   o  NSH-based SFC with SR-based transport tunnel

   o  SR-based SFC with Integrated NSH Service Plane

4.1.  Service Function Route Distribution

   For NSH-based SFC with SR-based transport tunnel, service information
   is maintained by NSH while SR is only used for transport between
   SFFs, so [I-D.ietf-bess-nsh-bgp-control-plane] can be used for this
   mode.

   To indicate NSH, an SFF label [I-D.ietf-mpls-sfc-encapsulation]
   should be inserted as the last label in the label stack in SR-MPLS.
   The control plane of SFF is also described in
   [I-D.ietf-bess-nsh-bgp-control-plane].  For choosing/configuring SR
   as the transport tunnel, BGP route of SFF's BGP Tunnel Encapsulation
   Attribute Type should be "SR TE Policy Type"
   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].  For SR-based SFC with
   Integrated NSH Service Plane, there is no control plane solution as
   yet defined.

4.2.  Service Function Path Route Distribution

   Same as SFIR distribution, SFPR BGP distribution in NSH-based SFC
   with SR-based transport tunnel is identical to the mechanism defined
   in [I-D.ietf-bess-nsh-bgp-control-plane].  PCEP extension for SFPR
   distribution can reuse the NSH based SFC extension defined in
   [I-D.wu-pce-traffic-steering-sfc].  For SR-based SFC with Integrated
   NSH Service Plane, control plane solution is to be added in other
   documents.

4.3.  Steer Packets into SFC

   For NSH-based SFC with SR-based transport tunnel, it is the same with
   the NSH based SFC.  The Classifier is responsible for determining to
   which packet flow a packet belongs (usually by inspecting the packet
   header), imposing an NSH, and initializing the NSH with the SPI of
   the selected SFP and the SI of its first hop
   [I-D.ietf-bess-nsh-bgp-control-plane].  For SR-based SFC with
   Integrated NSH Service Plane, control plane solution is to be added
   in other document.
