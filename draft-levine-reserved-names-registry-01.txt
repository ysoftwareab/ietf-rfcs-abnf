              Reserved and Special Domain Names Registries
                draft-levine-reserved-names-registry-01

Abstract

   Within the Domain Name System, several names have been reserved or
   used for special purposes, some at the top level and some at other
   levels.  IANA registries of Reserved and Special Names can reduce the
   likelihood of conflict of names and the consequent ambiguity.  This
   specification establishes those registries.

Internet-Draft     Reserved and Special Names Registry      January 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System[RFC1034] [RFC1035] provides a tree-structured
   name space with subtrees delegated to different organizations for
   management.  Other than the root, usually written as ".", no name has
   characteristics technically different from any other.  Nevertheless,
   some names in the DNS have historically been reserved for specific
   purposes, and have not been made available for delegation.  Other
   names do appear within delegated subtrees, but have by convention had
   a specialized interpretation.  The specialized and reserved names
   have hitherto been identified in a variety of documents but never
   listed in one place.  This document creates a registries for these
   reserved and specialized names.

   This document does _not_ attempt to describe rules or practices for
   delegation of subtrees of the DNS.

1.1.  Discussion List

   [[ RFC Editor: please remove this section before publication. ]]

   Until and unless a WG is created, this proposal will be discussed on
   the list ietf@ietf.org


2.  Registry Definitions

2.1.  DNS Reserved and Special Top Level Names

2.1.1.  Registry Name

   The recommended name of this registry is "DNS Reserved and Special
   Top Level Names".

2.1.2.  Registry Format

   IANA is requested to establish a registry for names that are reserved
   and special at the top level of the DNS.  Registration requests and
   registry entries should include the following:

   Name -  The reserved or special name.

   Category -  Reserved, for names not intended to be delegated on the
      public Internet, or Special, for names intended to be used in
      specified ways.

Internet-Draft     Reserved and Special Names Registry      January 2010


   Description -  A brief description of the name and, where
      appropriate, its usage.

   Reference -  A reference to an RFC or other definition of the name.

2.1.3.  Criteria for Registration

   This registry is intended to collect reserved and special names
   defined in RFCs and defined by designated managers.  For names at the
   top level, ICANN or its successor as manager must concur with any
   additions or deletions.

2.1.4.  Initial Contents of Registry

   As a service to users of the registry and the authors of existing
   specifications, all currently known reserved and special names are to
   be included into the registry upon creation.

2.2.2.  Registry Format

   IANA is requested to establish a registry for names that are reserved
   or special at the second level of the DNS.  Registration requests and
   registry entries should include the following:

   Name -  The reserved or special name.

   Category -  Reserved, for names not intended to be delegated on the
      public Internet, or Special, for names intended to be used in
      specified ways.

   Description -  A brief description of the name and, where
      appropriate, its usage.

   Reference -  A reference to an RFC or other definition of the name.

2.2.3.  Criteria for Registration

   This registry is intended to collect reserved and special names
   defined in RFCs and defined by designated managers.  The manager of
   the relevant top-level domain must concur with any additions or
   deletions to entries within that top-level domain.

2.2.4.  Initial Contents of Registry

   As a service to users of the registry and the authors of existing
   specifications, all currently known reserved and special names are to
   be included into the registry upon creation.

2.3.  .ARPA Domain Names

2.3.1.  Registry Name

   The recommended name of this registry is ".ARPA Domain Names".

2.3.2.  Registry Format

   within the .ARPA internet infrastructure top level domain[RFC3172].
   Registration requests and registry entries should include the
   following:

   Name -  The reserved or special name.

   Category -  Reserved, for names not intended to be delegated on the
      public Internet, or Special, for names intended to be used in

   defined in RFCs and defined by the designated manager, currently the
   Internet Architecture Board.

2.3.4.  Initial Contents of Registry

   As a service to users of the registry and the authors of existing

2.4.  Special Domain Name Components

2.4.1.  Registry Name

   The recommended name of this registry is "Special Domain Name
   Components".

2.4.2.  Registry Format

   IANA is requested to establish a registry for names that have a
   special interpretation within the DNS.  Registration requests and
   registry entries should include the following:

   Name -  The special name.

   Category -  Reserved, for names not intended to be delegated on the
      public Internet, or Special, for names intended to be used in
      specified ways.

   Description -  A brief description of the name and, where
      appropriate, its usage.

   Reference -  A reference to an RFC or other definition of the name.

2.4.3.  Criteria for Registration

   This registry is intended to collect special name components defined
   in RFCs.

2.4.4.  Initial Contents of Registry

   As a service to users of the registry and the authors of existing
   specifications, all currently known reserved and special names are to
   be included into the registry upon creation.

   +------------+-------------------------+----------------------------+
   | Name       | Description             | RFC#s/References and Notes |
   +------------+-------------------------+----------------------------+
   | _service   | SRV service names       | [RFC2782](#2)              |
   | _proto     | SRV protocol names      | [RFC2782](#3, #4)          |
   | _DOMAINKEY | DKIM signature          | [RFC4871]                  |
   |            | verification keys       |                            |
   | _ADSP      | DKIM ADSP policy        | [RFC5617]                  |

   +------------+-------------------------+----------------------------+

   Notes:

   #2 "_service" means the name of any service, preceded by an
      underscore, such as _LDAP.

   #3 This name appears as the penultimate name of a SRV record, where
      the leaf name is a "_service" name, or as a leaf name.

   #4 "_protocol" means the name of any protocol, preceded by an
      underscore, such as _TCP.  RFC 3861 [RFC3861] created the "Instant
      Messaging SRV Protocol Label Registry" for labels corresponding to
      protocols used in Instant Messaging.


3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to establish the registries described in
   Section 2.1, Section 2.2, Section 2.3, and Section 2.4, using the
   initial content specified in each of those sections of this document.

   New entries should be added to this registry when defined in an RFC
   and, if required, the relevant manager for the position in the DNS
   concurs.


4.  Security Considerations

   The creation of this registry provides improved documentation and
   protection against interoperability problems.  It introduces no new
