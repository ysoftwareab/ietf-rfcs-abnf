Abstract

   This memo describes how provider based Ethernet VPNs can be
   implemented using a directory (such as DNS) and LDP for PE discovery
   and label distribution.

1. Introduction

   This memo describes a simple mechanism to implement provider based
   bridged Ethernet VPNs using a directory and LDP [1] for PE discovery
   and label distribution.  The directory can be anything where the IP
   addresses of the PE routers of a VPN can be stored and queried from.
   In this memo we have chosen to use DSN directory as proposed in [2].

   An advantage of a directory/LDP based solution for provider based
   VPNs is that it doesn't require BGP implementation or configuration
   complexity in the PE routers and can be easily deployed also in
   inter-AS cases where the VPN sites are attached to PEs in more than

   one AS.  The choice of DNS for the directory is justified because it
   is already in wide use and can be deployed without any new
   standardization effort.

   Same kind directory/LDP based solution can also be applied to
   provider based Virtual Circuit VPNs.  If there is sufficient
   interest, the details will be specified in a later memo.

2. Addition of Sites

2.1 Configuration Actions

   The following configuration actions are needed when a new site (CE
   device) is added to a VPN:

     (1) If the PE device (PE for short) does not previously connect any
         sites of this VPN, the IP address of the PE is configured to
         DNS under domain name

         vpn-number.as-number.domain

         where "vpn-number" and "as-number" are components of the VPN ID
         (Route Distinguisher [3]) of the VPN and "domain" is the domain
         of the administrative "owner", (e.g., an ISP) of the VPN.

      (2) The port of the PE to which the site is connected to is
          configured to belong to the VPN.  This is done by specifying
          the domain, type, and VPN ID of the VPN.

   This document covers the case where the type of the VPN is
   "Ethernet".

   Note that also in the case of a multi-provider VPN, the
   administrative "owner" of the VPN is the single body that is
   responsible of making all DNS configuration changes for that VPN.

2.2 Protocol Actions

   After the above configuration actions the following ordered protocol
   actions take place in sequence at the PE of the new site if the PE of
   the new site doesn't previously connect site(s) of the VPN:

     (1) The PE of the new site checks that its own IP address has
         become available in all DNS servers serving the zone of the
         VPN.

     (2) The PE of the new site queries DNS for IP addresses of the
         other (remote) PEs of the VPN.

INTERNET DRAFT                                             October, 2001


     (3) The PE of the new site establishes an LDP session with each of
         the remote PEs unless one already exists.

     (4) The PE of the new site sends a Label Mapping Message to each of
         the remote PEs that advertises a label to be used when a remote
         PE sends packets to the sites of the VPN at the PE of the new
         site. Each such label MUST uniquely identify at the PE of the
         new site both the VPN and the sending PE.

   The Label Mapping Message uses the following VPN ID FEC TLV:

      0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |  VPN ID TLV   |      Address Family           |VPN ID Length  |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |          8 octet VPN Identifier (Route Distinguisher)         |
       +                      from RFC 2547 [3]                        +
       |                                                               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     Element type name: VPN ID
     Type: TBD by IANA
     Address Family: set to zero
     VPN ID Length: 8 octets

   When a remote PE receives a label advertisement from the PE of the
   new site, the remote PE first checks from DNS that the PE of the new
   site and it itself belong to the VPN of the advertised label.  If
   not, the remote PE responds to the Label Mapping Message with a Label
   Release Message.

   Otherwise the remote PE sends a Label Mapping Message to the PE of
   the new site that advertises a label to be used when the PE of the
   new site sends packets to the sites of the VPN at the remote PE.
   Again, the label MUST uniquely identify at the remote PE both the VPN
   and the PE of the new site.

   The remote PE only sends the Label Mapping message to the PE of the
   new site if it hasn't already done so for this VPN.  It may have
   already done so if the PE of the new site is recovering from crash as
   described in section 4.

   If the PE of the new site already connects site(s) of this VPN, no
   protocol actions take place at either the PE of the new site or at
   the remote PEs.

3. Removal of Sites

3.1 Configuration Actions

   The following configuration actions are needed when an existing site
   (CE device) is removed from a VPN:

     (1) If the site to be removed is the last site of the VPN at the
         PE, the IP address of the PE is removed from DNS.

     (2) The site is removed from the VPN by unconfiguring the VPN from
         the port of the PE to which the site is connected to.

3.2 Protocol Actions

   If the removed site was the last site of the VPN at the PE, the PE
   first checks that its IP address does not anymore exist in any DNS
   server serving the zone of the VPN.  The then PE of the removed site
   removes any existing labels of the VPN that it had advertised to the
   remote PEs by sending them a Label Withdraw Message.

   After a remote PE receives a Label Withdraw Message from the PE of
   the removed site, the remote PE automatically removes the
   corresponding label that it had advertised to the PE of the removed
   site by sending it a Label Withdraw Message.

   If, after removing the label, there is no remaining need to keep the
   LDP session up between the remote PE and the PE of the removed site,
   the remote PE MAY terminate the LDP session with the PE of the
   removed site.

4. Failure Recovery

   In case a PE looses its LDP session with another PE having site(s) in
   a common VPN, the PE releases the label it has advertised to the
   other PE for this VPN.  The PE then tries to re-establish the LDP
   session until the session gets established or until this PE or the
   other PE no longer have site(s) in this VPN.  Once the LDP session
   gets established, the PE advertises to the other PE a label to be
   used to send packets to the site(s) of the VPN at this PE as
   described in section 2.2.

   In case a PE recovers from a crash, it adds each of the configured
   VPN site(s) to their respective VPN(s) as described in section 2.2.
   Because the remote PEs are at the same time trying to establish LDP
   session(s) with the crashed PE and advertise their labels to it, the
   crashed PE MUST be prepared to accept label advertisements from the
   remote PE(s) for any VPNs of the crashed PE before the crashed PE

INTERNET DRAFT                                             October, 2001


   itself has advertised the corresponding labels to the remote PE(s).

5. Exponential Back-off Behavior

   If any protocol action does not succeed immediately, the normal
   behavior is that the PE keeps on trying with exponential back-off
   until the action succeeds or becomes invalid due to a change in VPN
   configuration.  If the protocol action fails for an implementation
   specific prolonged period of time, the PE SHOULD notify the VPN
   operator about the problem via a management action.

6. Data Plane

   The PEs that host the sites of a VPN act as fully connected learning
   bridges.  When PE A needs to forward an Ethernet packet to PE B, PE A
   prefixes the Ethernet packet by a label stack entry [4] holding the
   label that PE B has advertised to PE A for this VPN.  PE A then sends
   the resulting frame to PE B in any available tunnel, such as a HIP,
   GRE, IPSec, VLAN, or MPLS.

   How a PE decides, which tunneling protocol to use to send labeled
   packets to another PE, is outside the scope of this memo.  Usually
   the PE would try tunneling protocols in its own preferred order until
   the tunnel gets established.  In most cases the availability of a
   tunneling protocol can be determined by out-of-band means (e.g., DNS
   in case of HIP and IPSec, existence of an outer tunnel in case of
   MPLS, or existence of a shared authentication key in case of GRE).

7. DNS Zone Update Latency

   Since the addition of the first site and removal of the last site of
   a VPN in a particular PE cannot proceed before the change has
   propagated to all DNS servers serving the zone of the VPN, it is
   important to try to minimize the latency of VPN zone updates.  This
   can be achieved by turning on DNS NOTIFY [5] in the master server of
   each VPN zone and by configuring zone refresh times relatively small.

8. DNS Message Size

   Correct operation of directory/LDP based VPNs requires that IP
   addresses of all PE routers of a VPN fit into a single DNS response.
   In order to be able to support large VPNs with a large number of PEs,
   the message size requirements of [6] also apply to DNS servers and
   resolvers used for implementing the mechanism of this memo.
   Fulfilling those requirements allows provisioning of directory/LDP
   based VPNs that consist of a few hundred of PEs, which is envisioned
   to be more than adequate for Ethernet VPNs.

9. Security Considerations

   Security of directory/LDP based VPNs depends on security of the
   directory (DNS), LDP, and the tunneling protocol(s).  Security of LDP
   is covered in the security section of [1].  Also the various
   tunneling protocol specifications have their own security sections.

   Regarding DNS security, the important issues related to this memo are
   security of zone transfers and integrity and authentication of DNS
   queries and responses.  These two problems are addressed by DNS
   extensions [7] and [8].

   No DNS extensions exist for providing confidentiality for queries or
   responses. It is thus possible that if a party knows the VPN ID of a
   VPN and the zone that hosts it, the party can find out the IP
   addresses of PE routers that connect sites of that domain.  Depending
   on the situation, that may or may not be an acceptable security risk.

   In a single-provider VPN, the DNS servers that host the VPN
   information can be easily fire-walled from all public access. Another
   way to prevent outside parties from accessing VPN information is to
   use DNS access lists that VPN zone related queries only from trusted
   PE routers.

   See [2] for additional DNS/VPN related security discussion.
