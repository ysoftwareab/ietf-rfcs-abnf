   2.  Abstract

   This document defines a standard SNMP MIB for ADSL lines based on the
   ADSL Forum standard data model [9]. The model assumed by this MIB is
   that the SNMP agent's perspective is from the ATU-C side which acts
   as a proxy for the ATU-R.  Each MIB instance includes information for
   both ends of a single line, i.e., both the ATU-C and ATU-R.

   It should be noted that the first version of this document was
   derived from work completed by the ADSL Forum's Network Management
   working group and documented in ADSL Forum TR-006 "SNMP-based ADSL

   3.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [13].

   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for
        the purpose of management.  The first version of this
        Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and
        described in RFC 1155 [14], RFC 1212 [15] and RFC 1215 [16].
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902
        [1], RFC 1903 [2] and RFC 1904 [17].

   o    Message protocols for transferring management information.
        The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called
        SNMPv1 and described in RFC 1157 [7].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [18] and RFC 1906 [19].  The third version of the message
        protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [19], RFC
        2272 [20] and RFC 2274 [21].

   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information.
        The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU
        formats is described in RFC 1157 [7].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described
        in RFC 1905 [9].

   o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [22]
        and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC
        2275 [23].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This document specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
   A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some machine
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this

   loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the
   semantics of the MIB.


   4.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to
   the object type.


   5.  Introduction

   This document describes an ADSL Line MIB which is intended to work
   within the SNMP Network Management Framework (section 3).  All MIB
   definitions are backward compatible for SNMPv1 implementation.

   The MIB definitions are attached. The MIB will eventually be located
   in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission, as discussed in the MIB-2
   Integration (RFCs 1213 [4] and 2233 [5]) section of this document.
   Until approved by the IETF, vendors may also choose to support it
   under their own enterprise IDs.

   6.  Relationship of the ADSL LINE MIB with standard MIBs

   This section outlines the relationship of this MIB with other MIBs
   described in RFCs and in various degrees of "standardization".  MIB-2
   (RFC 1213 [4] and 2233 [5]) and the Entity MIB (RFC 2037 [25]) are
   discussed below.


   6.1  General MIB-2 Integration (RFCs 1213 [4] and 2233 [5])

   The ADSL LINE MIB specifies the detailed attributes of a data
   interface.  As such, it needs to integrate with MIB-2 (see [4] and
   [5]).  The IANA has assigned the following ifTypes to ADSL:

           adslFast(125),          -- ADSL Fast Channel

           }

   Of these, only adsl, adslFast, and adslInterleave are used with this
   MIB.  Use of radsl, sdsl, and vdsl is for further study (or they may
   have their own MIBs).

   Therefore, pending approval of the IETF, RFC 2233 [5] mandates that
   this MIB will be  accessed through mib-2.transmission.ifType as
   shown:

      adslPhysIf ::= { transmission 94 }      -- Physical tables

      adslInterIf ::= { transmission 124 }    -- Interleaved Channel
      tables

      adslFastIf ::= { transmission 125}      -- Fast Channel tables

   with each MIB branch containing the appropriate tables for that
   interface type, as discussed below. Most such tables extends the
   ifEntry table, and are indexed by ifIndex.  In addition, there are
   two "profile" tables which may be accessed by ifIndex, or may be
   accessed with a profileIndex, as discussed in section 7.4 Profiles.


   6.1.1  ADSL Interface Types

   As shown below, three ADSL interface types are defined in this
   document, namely physical, interleaved channel, and fast channel.
   The physical interface represents characteristics of the physical
   media associated with both the ATUC and ATUR.  The interleaved and
   fast channel interface represent the characteristics of the two types
   of ADSL channels.

   For each ADSL Line, a physical interface always exists.   Depending
   on which ADSL operational configuration is present (as listed in
   Figure 5), the channel interfaces (fast or interleaved) may or may
   not be optional.

   6.1.2  Use of Interface MIB RFC 2233 [5]

   The following attributes are part of the mandatory
   ifGeneralInformationGroup object group specified in RFC 2233 [5], and
   are not duplicated in the ADSL MIB. Remember that these objects apply
   to the line, not either end in particular.

      ifDescr - "manufacturer's name, model number, version number"
      associated with all ADSL interface entry types

      ifType - 94, 124, or 125, for physical, interleaved, and fast
      interface entries respectively

      ifSpeed - transmit rate from the perspective of the ATU-C
      interface, aka the "downstream" rate

      ifPhysAddress - not applicable for ADSL interface entries, must be
      0-length string

INTERNET-DRAFT               ADSL Line MIB                August 7, 1998


      ifAdminStatus, ifOperStatus - normal use, supplemented by
      adslAtucCurrStatus and adslAturCurrStatus for physical interfaces
      entry types only

      ifLastChange - The value of the last state change for all ADSL
      interface entry types

      ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable - default to Enable (1) for physical layer
      entry types, and to Disable (2) for interleaved, and fast
      interface channel entry types.

      ifConnectorPresent - set to True (1) for physical layer entries,
      and to False (2) interleaved, and fast interface entry types

      ifHighSpeed - As ADSL operates at a maximum rate of about 8Mbps
      circa 1997, ifHighSpeed is irrelevant, and is set to zero.

      ifName - Textual name for the interface allowing the network
      manager ability to associate an ifEntry with a specific
      node/shelf/slot/port of the ADSL equipment.

      ifNumber - The total number of ADSL network interfaces present on
      the system.

      ifAlias - A configurable textual name for the interface allowing
      the network manager ability to associate an ifEntry with a
      specific node/shelf/slot/port of the ADSL equipment.  This
      information is held in non-volatile storage.

      ifTableLastChange - The value of sysUpTime at the time of the last
      creation or deletion of an entry in the ifTable.

   The following attributes are from the ifFixedLengthGroup [5] which is
   optional, but is the closest set to ADSL.  They may optionally be
   implemented when appropriate.

      ifInOctets, ifOutOctets - counted from the perspective of the
      ATU-C interface for all ADSL interface entry types

      ifInUnknownProtos, ifInErrors, ifOutErrors  - counted from the
      perspective of the ATU-C interface for all ADSL interface entry
      types

   The table below shows this information in a more concise format.
   "Normal" means the object is used as specified by RFC 2233.  The
   designations "i", "j", and "k" indicate three arbitrary ifIndex
   values, corresponding to the physical, interleaved, and fast entries
   for a single ADSL Line.  These designations are used throughout this

   6.2  Relationship with RFC 2037 [25]

   Implementation of the Entity MIB [25] is optional.  It in no way
   alters the information required in the adslLineMib, nor does it alter
   the relationship with MIB-2, ifIndex, and ifStackTable.  The Entity
   MIB introduces a standardized way of presenting the components of
   complex systems, such as a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer
   (DSLAM), that may contain multiple racks, shelves, line cards, and/or
   ports.   The Entity MIB's main goal is to present these system
   components, their containment relationship, and mapping information

   with other MIBs such as the Interface MIB and the adslLineMib.

   If implemented, the Entity MIB should include entities for the ATU-C
   and ATU-R in the entPhysicalTable.  The MIB's entAliasMappingTable
   would  contain mapping information identifying the 'ifIndex' object
   associated with each ATU-C and ATU-R.  Also associating the
   relationship between the ifTable and Entity MIB, the entPhysicalTable
   contains an 'entPhysicalName' object, which approximates the
   semantics of the 'ifName' object from the Interface MIB.


   7.  Conventions used in the MIB


   7.1  Naming Conventions

   A. Atuc/Atur are used for the ATU-C and ATU-R.  In other RFCs, these
   are sometimes referred to as the Near End (Ne) and Far End (Fe)
   respectively, but not in this document.

   B. The terms, "transmit" and "receive", are from the perspective of
   the corresponding table's end of the line.  For example,
   adslAtucChanConfMaxTxRate defines the "downstream" rate, while
   adslAturChanConfMaxTxRate defines the "upstream" rate for a
   particular channel.

   C. There are two possible channels: fast, and interleaved.  Either
   none, one or both may be implemented on a particular ADSL Line.
   Figure 5 illustrates all possible operational configurations.

   D. Lof, Lol, Los, Lpr mean Loss of Framing, Link, Signal, and Power,
   respectively.  Lpr is used by T1E1, so it is used for consistency
   (rather than Lop).

   A Loss of Link condition is declared at the ATU-C if a Loss of Signal
   is not preceded by a 'dying-gasp' message from the ATU-R.  Note that
   Loss of Link is only supported by the ATU-C.

   E. ES means errored second. An Errored Second is any second
   containing one or more CRC anomaly, or one or more Los(s) or Severely
   Errored Frame (Sef) defect(s).

   F. A "block" is a physical-layer 'data buffer' over which CRCs are
   calculated.  For example, in DMT, the block is defined as the ADSL
   superframe.  The block duration is 250 micro-seconds so the block
   length in bytes, as defined in adslAtu*ChanCrcBlockLength, varies
   with data rate.

INTERNET-DRAFT               ADSL Line MIB                August 7, 1998


   G. Atn means Attenuation, Psd is Power Spectral Density and Snr is
   Signal to Noise Ratio.

   H. LCS means line code specific, e.g.,

      o DMT = Discrete MultiTone

      o CAP = Carrierless Amplitude and Phase modulation and

      o QAM = Quadrature Amplitude Modulation

   I. Vendor (in the Inventory objects) refers to the manufacturer or
   the ATU-C or ATU-R assembly, not the modem chip vendor. When in
   doubt, use the manufacturer of the smallest field replaceable unit
   (e.g., stand-alone modem box, plug-in board).


   7.2  Structure

   The MIB has multiple parallel tables.  There are tables for:

      o line -  common attributes

      o atuc and atur status

      o atuc and atur performance

          - Current and up to 96 buckets of 15 min performance history

          - Current and Previous 1 Day bucket performance history

      o profiles - configuration parameters and alarm parameters


   Also, there are separate tables for Physical and Channel layers. Only
   one set of "channel" tables are defined, which are used for both fast
   and interleaved channels, since the attributes are the same. The
   corresponding ifType gives the proper interpretation for that

   There could have been fewer tables by combining the ATU-C and ATU-R
   information into shared tables. However, the tables are more easily
   read when there are two identical sets of data.

   The figure below lists the five possible ADSL operational
   configurations. (indicated by the value of the adslLineType).  In all
   configurations, the physical line interface entry will exist.
   However, the existence of the ADSL channel varies in each case, as

   7.3  Counters, Interval Buckets and Thresholds

   For physical-level ES, Los, Lof, Lol, Lpr and line initialization
   attempts, there are event counters, current 15-minute and one (up to
   96) 15-minute history bucket(s) of "interval-counters", as well as
   current and previous 1 Day interval-counters.

   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure fixed relationship
   between the start of a fifteen minute and any wall clock; however
   some implementations may align the fifteen minute intervals with
   quarter hours.  Likewise, an implementation may choose to align one
   day intervals with start of a day.

   In all cases, the sum of the corresponding 15-minute interval timers
   for the current day should equal the current 1-day timers. However,
   in most cases, this will not be the sum of all 96 intervals, as they
   represent a rolling set of data.

   At the channel level, there are counters for total received blocks,
   received-and-corrected blocks, received-but-uncorrectable blocks, and
   transmitted blocks. Blocks are counted here because octets are
   counted by ifInOctets, ifOutOctets.  There are the same set of 15-
   minute and 1-day buckets as at the physical layer.

   Separate tables are provided for the 96 interval-counters. They are
   indexed by {ifIndex, AdslAtu*IntervalNumber}.

   Every physical layer object with a 15 minute current bucket also has
   a 15-min threshold trap.

   Counters are not reset when an ATU-C is reinitialized, only when the
   agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request outside
   the scope of this MIB).


   7.4  Profiles

   As a managed node can handle a large number of ATU-Cs (e.g., hundreds
   or perhaps thousands of ADSL lines), provisioning every parameter on
   every ATU-C may become burdensome.  In response, two MIB tables have
   been created to define ADSL equipment configuration data profiles, as
   well as a mechanism to associate the equipment to these profiles.
   This concept is similar to the one used in ATM MIB (RFC 1695[24])  to
   define ATM traffic descriptor sets.

   Profile tables may be implemented in one of two ways, but not
   simultaneously:

      o MODE-I: Dynamic Profiles - one profile shared by one or multiple
      ADSL lines.

      o MODE-II: Static Profiles - one profile per ADSL physical line
      always.

INTERNET-DRAFT               ADSL Line MIB                August 7, 1998


   7.4.1  MODE-I : Dynamic Profiles

   Implementations using this mode will enable the manager to
   dynamically create and delete profiles as needed.  The index of the
   profile is an arbitrary integer in the range 1..N, where N is the
   maximum number of profiles supported by the equipment and is
   implementation specific.

   One or more ADSL lines may be configured to share parameters in
   Profile-n (adslLineConfProfileIndex = 'n') by setting their
   adslLineConfProfile objects to the value of profile's index (n).  If
   a change is made to Profile-n, all lines that refer to it will be
   re-configured to the changed parameters.

   The next figure shows an example of how this mode can be implemented.
   In the example, ADSL lines '1' and 'x' share the configuration in
   Profile-n, while line '2' uses Profile-1.  Please note that three
   entries for each ADSL line, physical layer, the fast channel, and the
   interleaved channel, are represented by "i", "j", and "k" as before.
   However, only the physical-layer entry "i" contains an adslLineTable
   entry, so only those entries contain pointers to the
   adslConfProfileEntry.  The ifStackTable (see rfc2233 [5]) must be
   used to link the channel entries to the corresponding physical layer
   entry to get the channel's configuration parameters.

   The same is true for the alarm profile (not shown), although there is
   no requirement that its index (call it "m") be the same as the
   configuration profile.

   In this mode, profiles are allocated and deleted dynamically, and six
   objects:

      adslLineConfProfile, adslLineConfProfileIndexNext,
      adslLineConfProfileRowStatus, adlsLineAlarmProfile,
      adslLineAlarmConfProfileIndexNext, and
      adslLineAlarmConfProfileRowStatus

   are all used in conjunction with profiles.


   7.4.2  MODE-II : Static Profiles

   Implementations with this mode will automatically create a profile
   one-for-one with each ADSL line physical entry with the profileIndex
   being the same as the ifIndex of the corresponding ADSL line entry
   ("ix").   The Agent will not allow a Manager to create/delete
   profiles in this mode.  The adslLineConfProfile,
   adslLineConfProfileIndexNext, adslLineConfProfileRowStatus,
   adlsLineAlarmProfile, adslLineAlarmConfProfileIndexNext, and
   adslLineAlarmConfProfileRowStatus objects are not used in this mode
   as each line has a unique, fixed profile that is not shared with
   other lines.

   The figure below shows an example of this mode. In the example, ADSL
   lines '1', '2', and 'x' each have their own profiles.

   7.5  Traps

   These MIB-2 traps are required: coldStart / warmStart (per [6]) --
   which are per agent (e.g., per DSLAM in such a device), and linkUp /
   linkDown (per [5]) -- which are per interface (i.e., ADSL line).
   Note: RFC 2233 [5] recommends that linkUp / linkDown only be used at
   a physical layer ifEntry, as discussed above.

   A linkDown trap is generated whenever any of Lof, Los, Lol, or Lpr
   occurs.  At this operational point, a manager can use
   adslAtu*CurrStatus for additional detailed information. The
   corresponding linkUp trap is sent when all link failure conditions
   are cleared.

   The traps defined in this MIB are for initialization failure, rate
   change, and for the thresholds crossings associated with the
   following events: Lofs, Lols, Loss, Lprs, and ESs.  Each threshold
   has its own enable/threshold value. When that value is 0, the trap is
   disabled.

   The objects adslAtu*CurrStatus indicate, through a bitmask, all
   outstanding error conditions or that the line is operational.  Note
   that each object claims to represent the status of the modem at that
   end of the line.  However, since the SNMP agent co-resides with the
   ATU-C, adslAturCurrStatus may be incomplete. For example, when there
   are errors on the line, the ATU-R may not be able to correctly report
   this condition. Therefore, not all conditions are included in
   adslAturCurrStatus.

   A threshold trap occurs whenever the corresponding current 15-minute
   interval error counter becomes equal to the threshold value.  Since
   the current 15-minute counter are reset to 0 every 15 minutes, if the
   condition persists, the trap may recur as often as every 15 minutes.
   For example, to get a trap whenever a "loss of" event occurs (but at
   most once every 15 minutes), set the corresponding "Thresh15Min" to
   1.  The agent will generate a trap when the event originally occurs.
   Note that the NMS will get a linkDown trap, as well, if enabled.  At
   the beginning of the next 15 minute interval, the counter is reset.
   When the first second goes by, the current interval bucket will be 1,
   which equals the threshold, and the trap will be sent again.

   The  rate change trap is invoked when the transmit rate on a channel
   either increases by adsl(x)Thresh(y)RateDown or decreases by
   adsl(x)Thresh(y)RateDown. The trap is per direction:(x) == Atuc or
   Atur, and per channel: (y) == Fast or Interleave. In other words, the
   trap is sent whenever the rate changes in either direction on either
   channel and:

                CurrTxRate >= PrevTxRate plus ThreshRateUp

                                    or

               CurrTxRate <= PrevTxRate minus ThreshRateDown



   No trap is sent on initialization.

   It can be disabled by setting the Up (and/or) Down threshold rates to
   0.

   The PrevTxRate object is set to the current value at initialization
   and when a trap is sent.  Thus rate changes are cumulative until the
   total change exceeds the threshold.

   DESCRIPTION
       "The MIB module defining objects for the management of a pair of
        ADSL modems at each end of the ADSL line.  Each such Line is
        indexed by ifIndex and appears as an interface on a central
        DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Mux.) Attributes on the
        ATUR are proxied by the DSLAM.

        ADSL lines may support optional Fast or Interleaved channels.
        If these are supported, additional entries corresponding to the
        supported channels must be created in the ifTable. Thus an ADSL
        line that supports both channels will have three entries in the
        ifTable, one for each physical, fast, and interleaved, whose
        ifType values are equal to adsl(94), fast(125), and
        interleaved(124), respectively. The ifStackTable is used to
        link the entries together.

        Naming Conventions:
                 Atuc -- (ATUC) modem at near (Central) end of line
                 Atur -- (ATUR) modem at Remote end of line

   12.  Security Considerations

   1) Blocking unauthorized access to the ADSL MIB via the element
   management system is outside the scope of this document. It should be
   noted that access to the MIB permits the unauthorized entity to
   modify the profiles (sect  7.4) such that both subscriber service and
   network operations can be interfered with. Subscriber service can be

INTERNET-DRAFT               ADSL Line MIB                August 7, 1998


   altered by modifying any of a number of service characteristics such
   as rate partitioning and maximum transmission rates. Network
   operations can be impacted by modification of trap thresholds such as
   SNR margins.

   2) Security issues of unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure,
   and tampering posed by direct network level connectivity to the ADSL
   Access Node can be addressed by the use of SNMPv3.

   3) ADSL layer connectivity from the ATU-R will permit the subscriber
   to manipulate both the ADSL link directly and the AOC/EOC channels
   for their own loop.  For example,  unchecked or unfiltered
   fluctuations initiated by the subscriber could generate sufficient
