Internet Draft                IAB Charter                  December 1999


1. IAB Membership

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) shall consist of thirteen
   voting members, composed of the chair of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), and of twelve full members.  The IETF chair, who
   is also the chair of the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG),
   may vote on all official IAB actions except the approval of IESG
   members and appeals against IESG decisions. Ex-officio and liaison
   members of the IAB may also attend IAB meetings but shall have no
   vote on official actions.

   Members of the IAB shall serve as individuals, and not as
   representatives of any company, agency, or other organization.



1.1  Selection of voting IAB members

   Voting IAB members, including the IETF chair, are selected and
   appointed according to the procedures defined in [BCP 10] . Normally,
   six full members are appointed each year to sit for two years, and
   the IETF chair is appointed every two years.

   There is no limit to the number of terms that a member of the IAB may
   serve, subject to the process defined by [BCP 10].



1.2 Ex-Officio and Liaison members

   Ex-officio and liaison members of the IAB have no vote but
   participate fully in IAB discussions. However, an ex-officio position
   may be held by a voting member, who does not thereby lose his or her
   vote. Liaison positions may not be held by a voting member.

   The chair of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) is an ex-officio
   member of the IAB. The IAB has an Executive Director who is an ex-
   officio member of the IAB.

   The Internet Society, the RFC Editor, the IANA and the IESG each
   appoints a liaison member to the IAB.




2.  The Role of the IAB

   The IAB is chartered both as a committee of the IETF and as an
   advisory body of the Internet Society.  Its responsibilities include:

   (a) IESG Appointment

   The IAB appoints a new IETF chair and all other IESG candidates, from
   a list provided by the IETF nominating committee established under
   [BCP 10].

   (b) Architectural Oversight

   The IAB provides oversight of the architecture for the protocols and
   procedures used by the Internet. This point is expanded in Section
   2.1 below.

   (c) Standards Process Oversight and Appeal

   The IAB provides oversight of the process used to create Internet
   Standards [BCP 9].

   The IAB serves as an appeal board for complaints of improper
   execution of the standards process, with powers defined in [BCP 9].

   (d) RFC Series and IANA

   The RFC Editor executes editorial management and publication of the
   IETF "Request for Comment" (RFC) document series, which is the
   permanent document repository of the IETF.  The RFC series
   constitutes the archival publication channel for Internet Standards
   and for other contributions by the Internet research and engineering
   community. RFCs are available free of charge to anyone via the
   Internet. The RFC Editor operates under the responsibility of the
   IAB.

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) administers various
   protocol parameters used by IETF protocols, delegating this
   administration as appropriate. The IANA operates with the advice and
   consent of the IAB on technical matters, taking technical direction
   from the IESG.

   (e) ISOC Liaison

   The IAB acts as a source of advice and guidance to the Board of
   Trustees and Officers of the Internet Society concerning technical,
   architectural, procedural, and (where appropriate) policy matters
   pertaining to the Internet and its enabling technologies. If
   necessary the IAB may convene panels of knowledgeable people, hold
   hearings, and otherwise pursue the investigation of specific
   questions or topics presented to it by the Internet Society.

   (f) External Liaison

   The IAB acts as representative of the interests of the IETF and the
   Internet Society in technical liaison relationships with other
   organizations concerned with standards and other technical and
   organizational issues relevant to the world-wide Internet. Liaisons
   are kept as informal as possible and must be of demonstrable value in
   improving the quality of IETF specifications.  Individual members of
   the IETF are appointed as liaisons to other organizations by the IAB
   or IESG as appropriate.

2.1 Architectural oversight in more detail

   A major role of the IAB is long range planning and coordination
   between different areas of IETF activity.  The IAB, both collectively
   and on an individual basis, is expected to pay attention to important
   long-term issues in the Internet, and to make sure that these issues
   are brought to the attention of the group(s) that are in a position
   to address them.  It is also expected to play a role in assuring that
   the people responsible for evolving the Internet and its technology
   are aware of the essential elements of the Internet architecture.

   IAB members pay special attention to emerging activities in the IETF
   and to "Birds of a Feather" sessions at IETF meetings.  The IAB
   assists the IESG in evaluating such activities and in determining
   whether an IETF or an IRTF group is more appropriate.  When a new
   IETF working group is proposed, the IESG will forward a preliminary
   version of the charter to the IAB for review of architectural
   consistency and integrity.  The IAB shall review these proposed
   charters and give feedback to the IESG as appropriate.

   Pursuant to the architectural oversight function, the IAB sponsors
   and organizes the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) [BCP 8].  The
   IAB reviews proposed IRTF groups.

   The IAB will convene invitational workshops to perform in-depth
   reviews of particular architectural issues.  Such reviews may include
   consideration of relevant IETF and IRTF activities, and of work in
   other organizations, and for this purpose the workshop may invite
   presentations by qualified parties on the design goals and decisions,
   technology choices, and other pertinent aspects of these activities.
   The results of such a review will be a report which may give advice
   to the IETF community and the IESG.

   The IAB may organize ad hoc bodies of independent technical experts
   to adjudicate technical disputes.




3. IAB Organization



3.1 IAB chair

   The members of the IAB shall select one of its full members to serve
   as the chair of the IAB, with all of the duties and responsibilities
   normally associated with such a position.  The term of the IAB chair
   shall be one year, with no restriction on renewal.  The chair of the
   IAB may be removed at any time by the affirmative vote of two-thirds
   of the members of the IAB, or as a result of his or her departure
   from the IAB.

   The chair of the IAB shall have the authority to organize the IAB.

3.2 Executive Director

   The chair of the IAB shall have the authority to appoint an Executive
   Director (ExecD) for a one-year renewable term, and to remove him or
   her. The ExecD shall administer the internal operation of the IAB,
   e.g., organization of meetings and reporting of their results.

   The ExecD is an ex-officio member as defined in Section 1.2.



3.3 Selection of the IRTF chair

   The IAB shall have the authority to appoint the chair of the Internet
   Research Task Force (IRTF) for a two-year renewable term, and to
   remove him or her. The IRTF chair shall be responsible for the
   management and organization of the IRTF according to [BCP 8].

   The IRTF chair is an ex-officio member as defined in Section 1.2.



3.4 Liaisons within the IETF

   The chair of the IAB and another voting IAB member (other than the
   IETF chair), to be selected by the IAB, shall serve as liaisons to
   the IESG. In addition, the IESG will appoint one of its members
   (other than the IETF chair) to serve as a liaison to the IAB.  The
   IESG liaison may attend IAB meetings but shall have no vote.



3.5 Voting rule

   The IAB attempts to reach all decisions by unanimous consensus.  In
   the event that a vote is required, a motion passes if there are not
   fewer than seven votes in favour and not more than two against.



3.6 Openness and confidentiality

   The IAB publishes minutes of all its meetings on the Internet, and
   conducts an open meeting at every IETF meeting. It publishes all its
   findings as RFCs, Internet Drafts or messages to the IETF mailing
   list. However, discussion of personnel matters and possibly legal and
   financial matters may sometimes require to be kept confidential.

   Specifically, the IAB makes use of the second level domain iab.org
   and the URL http://www.iab.org to publish information.
