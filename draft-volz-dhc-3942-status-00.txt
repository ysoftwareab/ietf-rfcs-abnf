Internet-Draft           RFC 3942 Status Report               April 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document provides a status report as of March 2007 for the
   effort to reclassify Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4) [2]
   options 128 to 223 as managed by IANA in accordance with RFC 3942
   [1].  This document further recommends actions to be taken by IANA to
   finalize this reclassification effort.

   RFC 3942 was published in November 2004 and stipulated a process and
   time table for vendors using options in the 128 to 223 range to
   request IANA to assign those options to the vendors' use.  The time
   table for the process has elapsed.


2.  Summary of Activity

   After the publication of RFC 3942, several vendors and other uses of
   DHCPv4 options 128 to 223 were reported and IANA placed the following
   options in the tentatively assigned state in June 2005:

   128  Reported as used by Intel's PXE [4], Etherboot (etherboot
        signature of octets e4:45:74:68:00:00), Cablelabs (DOCSIS "full
        security" server IP address), and Mitel (IP phone software load
        TFTP server IP address) [5].
   129  Reported as used by Intel's PXE [4], Etherboot (kernel options),
        and Mitel (call server IP address) [5].
   130  Reported as used by Intel's PXE [4], Etherboot (ethernet
        interface), and Mitel (discrimination string - identifies
        vendor) [5].
   131  Reported as used by Intel's PXE [4] and Mitel (remote statistics
        server IP address) [5].
   132  Reported as used by Intel's PXE [4] and Mitel (802.1P VLAN id)
        [5].
   133  Reported as used by Intel's PXE [4] and Mitel (802.1Q L2
        priority) [5].
   134  Reported as used by Intel's PXE [4] and Mitel (diffserv code
        point) [5].
   134  Reported as used by Intel's PXE [4] and Mitel (HTTP proxy for
        phone-specific applications) [5].
   150  Reported as used by Cisco (TFTP server address) [6], Etherboot
        (usage unknown), and GNU Grub (GRUB configuration path name).
   175  Reported as used by Etherboot (usage unknown).
   176  Reported as used by Avaya (IP telephone).
   177  Reported as used by Etherboot (usage unknown) and by Cablelabs
        (though that use has been deprecated in favor of option 122
        [3]).

Internet-Draft           RFC 3942 Status Report               April 2007


   208  Reported as used by PXELINUX (MAGIC) [7].
   209  Reported as used by PXELINUX (ConfigFile) [7].
   210  Reported as used by PXELINUX (Pathprefix) [7].
   211  Reported as used by PXELINUX (Reboottime) [7].
   220  Reported as used by Cisco (subnet allocation) [8].
   221  Reported as used by Cisco (virtual subnet selection option) [9].

   For those options where multiple uses were demonstrated to be in
   reasonably wide usage, RFC 3942 stipulated that none of the users
   would be allowed to retain that option number.  However, this assumed
   that each of these users would follow through on the process.

   Since that time:
   o  The Mitel draft [5] expired in November 2005.
   o  The PXELINUX draft [7] expired in November 2006.  And, an updated
      draft has just been published.
   o  The Cisco TFTP server draft [6] expired in December 2005.  And, an
      updated draft is expected to be published shortly.
   o  The Cisco subnet allocation draft [8] is presently active.
   o  The Cisco virtual subnet selection option [9] expired in December
      2005.  And, an updated draft has just been published.
   o  No internet-draft was ever published for options used by
      Etherboot, GRUB, or Avaya.


3.  Recommendations

   Based on the process and time table specified by RFC 3942, the
   following actions are recommended:

   128  Assign to Intel's PXE [4].
   129  Assign to Intel's PXE [4].
   130  Assign to Intel's PXE [4].
   131  Assign to Intel's PXE [4].
   132  Assign to Intel's PXE [4].
   133  Assign to Intel's PXE [4].
   134  Assign to Intel's PXE [4].
   134  Assign to Intel's PXE [4].
   150  Leave tentatively assigned to Cisco (TFTP server address)
        pending republication and continued forward process on [6].
   175  Move to "Unassigned" (thus available for assignment).
   176  Move to "Unassigned" (thus available for assignment).
   177  Move to "Unassigned" (thus available for assignment).
   208  Leave tentatively assigned to PXELINUX (MAGIC) pending
        republication and continued forward process on [7].

        republication and continued forward process on [8].
   221  Leave tentatively assigned to Cisco (virtual subnet selection
        option) pending republication and continued forward process on
        [9].
