Abstract

   This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) protocol over the Stream Control Transmission
   Protocol (SCTP).

   The user of DTLS over SCTP can take advantage of all features
   provided by SCTP and its extensions, especially support of

   o  multiple streams to avoid head of line blocking.

Internet-Draft                DTLS for SCTP                    July 2008


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) protocol, as defined in [RFC4347], over the Stream
   Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), as defined in [RFC4960].

   TLS is designed to run on top of a byte-stream oriented transport
   protocol providing a reliable, in-sequence delivery.  Thus, TLS is
   currently mainly being used on top of the Transmission Control
   Protocol (TCP), as defined in RFC0793 [RFC0793].

   TLS over SCTP as described in [RFC3436] has some serious limitations:

   o  It does not support the unordered delivery of SCTP user messages.

   o  It does not support partial reliability as defined in [RFC3758].

   o  It only supports the usage of the same number of streams in both
      directions.

   o  It uses a TLS connection for every bidirectional stream, which
      requires a substantial amount of resources and message exchanges
      if a large number of streams is used.

   DTLS over SCTP as described in this document overcomes these
   limitations of TLS over SCTP.  The user of DTLS over SCTP can use all
   services provided by SCTP and its partial reliability extension.  The
   dynamic modification of the IP-addresses used by the SCTP end-points
   is also supported.

   The method described in this document requires that the SCTP
   implementation supports the optional feature of fragmentation of SCTP
   user messages and the SCTP authentication extension defined in
   [RFC4895].

1.2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

   Association:  An SCTP association.

   Connection:  A TLS connection.

   Session:  A TLS session.

   Stream:  A unidirectional stream of an SCTP association.  It is
      uniquely identified by a stream identifier.

1.3.  Abbreviations

   DTLS:  Datagram Transport Layer Security

   MTU:  Maximum Transmission Unit

   SCTP:  Stream Control Transmission Protocol

   TCP:  Transmission Control Protocol

   TLS:  Transport Layer Security


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  DTLS considerations

3.1.  Message fragmentation

   The DTLS layer MUST NOT perform message fragmentation.  The SCTP
   layer will perform this task.  Thus the supported maximum length of
   SCTP user messages MUST be at least 2^14 + 2048 + 5 = 18437 bytes.
   Every DTLS message MUST be handled as one user message for SCTP.

3.2.  Message sizes

   DTLS imposes a limit in the user message size.  This limit applies
   also to DTLS/SCTP.

3.3.  Replay detection

   Replay detection of DTLS MUST NOT be used.

3.4.  Path MTU Discovery

   Path MTU discovery of DTLS MUST NOT be used.

3.5.  Retransmission of Messages

   DTLS procedures for retransmissions MUST NOT be used.


4.  SCTP considerations

4.1.  Stream usage

   All DTLS control messages MUST be transported on stream 0 with
   unlimited reliability and with the ordered delivery feature.

   User data messages MAY be transported over stream 0 but users SHOULD
   use other streams for better performance.

4.2.  Chunk handling

   The DATA, SACK and FORWARD-TSN chunks of SCTP MUST be sent in an
   authenticated way as described in [RFC4895].  Other chunks MAY be
   sent in an authenticated way.

   This makes sure that an attacker can not modify the stream a message
   is sent in or affect the ordered/unordered delivery of the message.
   It is also not possible for an attacker to drop messages and use
   forged FORWARD-TSN and SACK chunks to hide this dropping.

4.3.  Handling of endpoint-pair shared secrets

   The endpoint-pair shared secret for Shared Key Identifier 0 is empty.
   Whenever the master key changes, a 64 byte shared secret is derived
   from the master secret and provided as a new end-point pair shared
   secret by using the algorithm described in
   [I-D.rescorla-tls-extractor].

   The Shared Key Identifier MUST be incremented by 1.  If it is 65535,
   the next value MUST be 1.

   Before sending the Finished message the active SCTP-AUTH key MUST be
   switched to the new one.  The Finished message MUST NOT be sent
   before all messages except the ones from this handshake have been
   acknowledged and can not be revoked anymore by the peer.

   Once the corresponding Finished message from the peer has been
   received the old key SHOULD be removed.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to add a value to the TLS Extractor Label registry as
   described in [I-D.rescorla-tls-extractor].  The label suggested is
   EXTRACTOR_DTLS_OVER_SCTP.  The reference should refer to this
   document.


6.  Security Considerations
