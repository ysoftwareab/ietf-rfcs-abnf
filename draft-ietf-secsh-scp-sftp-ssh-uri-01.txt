Abstract 
    
   This document describes the Uniform Resource Identifiers used to 
   locate resources for the SCP, SFTP, and SSH protocols.  The document 
   describes the generic syntax involved in URI definitions as well as 
   specific definitions for each protocol.  These specific definitions 
   may include user credentials such as username and password and also 
   may include other parameters such as fingerprint.  In addition, 
   security considerations and examples are also provided within this 
   document.

1.   General Syntax 
    
   The URI for each protocol shall consist of the scheme and the scheme 
   specific portion separated by a colon ":", as discussed in RFC 2396 
   [1].  This specification shall adopt the definitions "port", "host", 
   "scheme", "userinfo", and "authority" from RFC 2396. 
    
1.1     SSH URI 
    
   The SSH scheme shall consist of the protocol acronym followed by a 
   colon ":" and a double slash "//" in accordance with RFC 2718. 
    
   The first component of the scheme specific portion MAY include 
   credentials (userinfo) consisting of a username and optionally also 
   including a password.  Including the password in the URL is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  The username and password components are separated by a 
   single colon ":". 
    
   Following the userinfo, if present, the at-sign "@" shall precede the 
   authority section of the URI.  Optionally, the authority section MAY 
   also include the port preceded by a colon ":". If the port is not 
   included, the default port is assumed.  Following the port additional 
   parameters may be specified.  These parameters are defined in the 
   connection parameters section. 
    
      ssh_URI = "ssh://" [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ] 
         [;conn-parameter=value] 
    
1.2     SCP and SFTP URI 
    
   For SCP and SFTP, the scheme portion (scp: or sftp:) is followed by a 
   double slash "//".

                        SCP/SFTP/SSH URI Format           October 2003 
 
 
   Both SCP and SFTP URLs are terminated by a single slash "/" followed 
   by the path information to the requested resource. 
    
   The first component of the scheme specific portion MAY include 
   credentials (userinfo) consisting of a username and optionally also 
   including a password.  Including the password in the URL is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  The username and password components are separated by a 
   single colon ":". 
    
   Following the userinfo, if present, the at-sign "@" shall precede the 
   authority section of the URL.  Optionally, the authority section MAY 
   also include the port preceded by a colon ":".  If the port is not 
   included, the default port is assumed.  Following the port additional 
   parameters may be specified.  These parameters are defined in the 
   connection parameters section. 
    
      scp_URI = "scp://" [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]  
         [ ; parameter = value ] [ abs_path ] 
    
   Following the port additional parameters may be specified.  These 
   parameters are defined in the connection parameters section.  
   Following the path additional sftp specific parameters may be 
   specified. 
    
      sftp_URI = "sftp://" [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ] 
         [;conn-parameter=value] [ abs_path ] [;sftp-parameter=value] 
    
   The URIs for SFTP and SCP are hierarcical URIs where each component  
   of the abs_path consists of path elements separated by a '/'. This is 
   the same format as used in the FTP URL described in section 2.2.2 of 
   [5]. 
    
    
2.   Parameters 
    
2.1     SSH connection parameters 
    
   The following parameters are associated with an SSH connection and 
   are applicable to SSH, SFTP and SCP.  All parameters are optional and 
   MUST NOT overwrite configured defaults.  Individual parameters are 
   separated by a comma (","). 
    
   fingerprint 
    
   The fingerprint parameter contains the fingerprint of the host key 
   for the host specified in the URL.  The fingerprint is encoded as 
   host-key-alg:fingerprint.  Host-key-alg is host public key algorithm 
   defined [4] and the fingerprint format is defined in [2].

                        SCP/SFTP/SSH URI Format           October 2003 
 
 
   This parameter MUST NOT overwrite a key that is already configured 
   for the host.  The fingerprint MAY be used to validate the 
   authenticity of the host key if the URL was obtained from an 
   authenticated source with its integrity protected.  If this parameter 
   is not included then the validity of the host key is validated using 
   another method.  See Security Considerations section for additional 
   considerations.  There MUST be only one fingerprint parameter per 
   host-key-alg for a given URL. 
    
2.2     SFTP Parameters 
    
   The SFTP parameters determine how to handle the file transfer 
   character translation. 
    
   newline 
    
   The newline parameter determines how the server translates new line 
   indicators.  The possible choices are usually "\r" or "\n" or "\r\n".  
   The default is "\r\n". 
    
   typecode 
    
   The typecode identifies the type of file which determines how it will 
   be treated. Possible values are "i" for binary files, "a" for text 
   files, and "d" for directory listings. 
    
3.   Examples 
    
   The following section shows basic examples of URLs for each protocol.  
   This section should not be considered to include all possible 
   combinations of URLs for each protocol. 
    
         ssh://user@host 
    
         ssh://user@host:2222 
    
         ssh://joeuser@example.com;fingerprint=ssh-dss:c1:b1:30:29:d7:b8 
             :de:6c:97:77:10:d7:46:41:63:87 
    
         scp://user:password@host/file.txt 
    
         sftp://user@host/dir/path/file.txt  
    
         sftp://joeuser@example.com:2222;fingerprint=ssh-dss:c1:b1:30 
             :29:d7:b8:de:6c:97:77:10:d7:46:41:63:87, 
    
    
4.   Security Considerations

   In general, URIs themselves have no security considerations.  
   However, since the password for each scheme can optionally be 
   included within the URL it should be noted that doing so poses a 
   security risk.  Since URLs are usually sent in the clear with no 
   encryption or other security, any password or other credentials 
   (userinfo) included could be seen by a potential attacker. 
    
   Care must also be taken in handling fingerprints associated with URLs 
   because URLs transmitted or stored without protection may be modified 
   by an attacker.  In general an implementation cannot determine the 
   source of a URL so a fingerprint received in a URL should have no 
   more trust associated with it than a raw public key received in the 
   SSH protocol itself.  If a locally configured key exists for the 
   server already it MUST NOT be automatically overwritten with 
   information from the URL. If the host is unknown then the 
   implementation should treat the fingerprint received with the same 
   caution that it does with any unknown public key.  The client MAY 
   offer the fingerprint and URL for external validation before allowing 
   a connection based on this information. If the client chooses to make 
   a connection based on the URL information and it finds that the 
   public key in the URL and the public key offered by the server do not 
   match then it SHOULD provide a warning and provide a means to abort 
   the connection.  Sections 3.1 and 8.2.4 of [3] provide a good 
   discussion of handling public keys received in the SSH protocol.
