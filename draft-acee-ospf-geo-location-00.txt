   OSPF Extensions for Advertising/Signaling Geo Location Information
                  draft-acee-ospf-geo-location-00.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies an OSPF Link-Local-Signaling (LLS) TLV to
   signal the current Geo Coordinates of the OSPF router.  For Point-to-
   Point (P2)) and Point-to-Multi-Point (P2MP) networks, the Geo
   Coordinates can be used to dynamically computing the cost to
   neighbors.  This is useful both from the standpoint of auto-
   configuration and situations where the OSPF routers are moving.  The
   Geo Coordinates are also useful for other applications such as
   Traffic Engineering (TE) and network management and can be advertised
   in the OSPF Router Information (RI) LSA.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies an OSPF Link-Local-Signaling (LLS) TLV to
   signal the current Geo Coordinates of the OSPF router.  For Point-to-
   Point (P2)) and Point-to-Multi-Point (P2MP) networks, the Geo
   Coordinates can be used to dynamically computing the cost to
   neighbors.  This is useful both from the standpoint of auto-
   configuration and situations where the OSPF routers are moving.  The
   Geo Coordinates are also useful for other applications such as
   Traffic Engineering (TE) and network management and can be advertised
   in the OSPF Router Information (RI) LSA [OSPF-RI].

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-KEYWORDS].

2.  OSPF Geo Coordinates TLV

   The Geo Coordinates TLV can be used to advertise the current location
   of an OSPFv2 [OSPF] or OSPFv3 [OSPFV3] router using either OSPF Link-
   Local-Signaling [LLS] or the OSPF Router Information LSA [OSPF-RI].
   The Geo Coordinates TLV encoding is adapted from the format in
   [LISP-CAF].  The value of the Geo Coordinates TLV consists of the
   following fields:

   Type:    TBD. 8 bits value, to be assigned by IANA.

   Length:  Variable. 8 bits value.  The mandatory part is 12 octets.

   N:       Bit indicating North (set) or South (clear).

   Latitude Degrees:  Valid values range from 0 to 90 degrees above or
            below the equator (northern or southern hemisphere,
            respectively).

   Latitude Minutes:  Valid values range from 0 to 59.

   Latitude Seconds:  Valid values range from 0 to 59.

   E:       Bit indicating East (set) or West (clear).

   Longitude Degrees:  Value values are from 0 to 180 degrees right or
            left of the Prime Meridian.

   Longitude Minutes:  Valid values range from 0 to 59.

   Longitude Seconds:  Valid values range from 0 to 59.

   Altitude:  Height relative to sea level in meters.  This is a signed
              integer meaning that the altitude could be below sea
              level.  A value of 0x7fffffff indicates no Altitude value
              is encoded.

   Optional Sub-TLVs:  No additional Sub-TLVs are defined in this
                       document.


                         OSPF Geo Coordinates TLV

3.  OSPF Geo Coordinates Link-Local-Signaling

   The OSPF Geo Coordinates TLV may optionally be included in the Link-
   Local-Signaling [LLS] data block appended to OSPF hello packets.

   When an OSPF router receives the Geo Coordinates TLV in the LLS
   extension from an adjacent neighbor, it can be used to calculate the
   physical distance to neighbor.  For P2P and P2MP networks, this
   distance can be used to dynamically compute the cost of the link to
   that neighbor.  The mapping of the distance to advertised cost is a
   local matter and is not specified in this document.  Computation of
   cost based on physical distance can be useful both for
   autoconfiguration of these networks types and dynamic cost
   computation when the routers are moving.

   The Geo location information can be statically provisioned or
   dynamically acquired from a GPS capable device on the OSPF Router.

4.  OSPFv2 Router Information (RI) Opaque LSA

   The OSPF Geo Coordinates TLV may optionally be advertised in the OSPF
   Router Information (RI) LSA [OSPF-RI].  It then may be used for
   applications such as traffic engineering (TE) and network management
   (e.g., the Find-My-Router application).  The details of such
   applications are beyond the scope of this document.

5.  Security Considerations

   Since the Geo Location coordinates provide the exact location of the
   OSPF router, disclosure will make the OSPF router more susceptible to
   physical attacks.  In situations where this is a concern (e.g.,
   military applications), confidentiality should be provided either
   through a secure tunnel (e.g., [IP-ESP]) or protocol encryption
   [OSPFV3-AUTH].

   Additionally, in some situations, the topology of the network is
   considered proprietary information.  With the Geo Location
   coordinates, the physical topology, as well as the IP topology, can
   be discerned from the OSPF Router Information (RI) LSA.  In these
   situations, confidentiality should be assured.

   Security considerations for the base OSPF protocol are covered in
   [OSPF] and [OSPFV3].

6.  IANA Considerations

   The document will require two IANA actions:

   1.  An LLS Type TLV for the Geo Location TLV will be allocated from
       the OSPF Link Local Signaling TLV Identifiers (LLS Types)
       registry.

   2.  A Router Information TLV type for the Geo Location TLV will be
       allocated from the OSPF Router Information (RI) TLVs registry.
