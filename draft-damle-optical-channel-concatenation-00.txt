Abstract

This contribution identifies the need and requirements for 
concatenating optical channels to create multiple high bandwidth 
payload channels. To maximize the benefits of standardization, the 
concatenation methodolgy should be independant of framing protocols 
e.g., SONET, GFP, OCh etc.) as well as payload types (e.g., Packet,  
Cell, Byte Stream).  
  
A contribution for the need to concatenate optical channels was made 
at the T1X1.5 meeting in March 2001 and was accepted for further 
proposals. This contribution is based on the T1X1.5 contribution and
is presented herein for information only.

1.  Introduction

Historically, port speeds on routers and switches used in the backbone 
network were lower than the bandwidths used and needed for efficient 
transport over optical fibers. This required devices such as SONET Add 
Drop Multiplexers (ADMs) to multiplex multiple lower data rate sources 
to higher data rates for transport.

Today the bandwidth requirements between the core routers/switches have 
increased from 2.5 Gb/s (OC-48) to 10 Gb/s (OC-192) in some cases. 
Routers with OC-48 or OC-192 capable port cards and a transport 
system that can carry that data rate over a single wavelength have 
supported these increases.

In the future, data bandwidth demands between core switch sites are 
projected to quickly grow to 100s of Gb/s. To meet this demand service 
providers have to deploy multiple routers per switch site. This results 
in using multiple ports at 2.5 Gb/s or 10 Gb/s for inter router 
connections within a site as well as between sites [Figure 1].

To eliminate inter router connections within a site, routers are scaling 
up capacity per router by developing switch fabric that can support 
several thousands of ports at 2.5 Gb/s or 10 Gb/s. Routers with large  
numbers of low-speed ports make the network difficult to manage and 
hence expensive.

2.  Discussion

For carriers to deploy manageable and stable data networks that meet the 
projected growth in bandwidth demands, new requirements on router 
designs and WDM transmission system designs are emerging.

Figure 2: Need for transparently concatenating multiple optical channels

The router designs have to change from large number of 2.5 Gb/s or 10 
Gb/s switch fabric ports to a small number of 40 Gb/s and higher 
capacity ports. Advances in semiconductor technology and high speed 
packet processing are key to enabling high speed router ports at 40 Gb/s 
and beyond. The semiconductor technology available today is already 
capable of supporting aggregates of more than 40 Gb/s throughput per 
port.

In transmission systems, the WDM systems requirements are changing to 
ultra long reach between terminals in order to make transport as 
economical as possible. The ultra long reach requirement over existing 
fiber plant is limiting the maximum data rate per wavelength that can be 
transported economically. Economical ways to mitigate fiber non-
linearities, advances in optical amplification, laser modulation and 
optical mux/demux technologies will enable higher data rates per lambda. 

The semiconductor technology is already enabling router/switch fabric 
ports at 40 Gb/s and greater. However deployable transmission systems 
are far from being ready to transport 40 Gb/s and greater per wavelength 
over ultra long reach distances. Therefore there is a clear need to
concatenate lower speed WDM optical channels (sub-channels) that use any 
framing protocol to form one or more higher bandwidth interfaces (super 
channels) to the routers/switches.

In the future semiconductor technologies are expected to develop 
faster than high speed optical transmission technologies creating a 
sustained need for concatenating multiple optical channels to create 
high bandwidth channels.

Standardizing a methodology to concatenate multiple optical channels 
that is agnostic to the transport framing protocols and payload types 
will have a significant impact on the both the equipment manufacturers 
and the carriers. The standardized methodology will completely de-couple 
the router/switch equipment from the transmission equipment. This 
de-coupling will allow the development of new equipment in both domains 
such that carriers can extract huge savings by deploying large but 
manageable routers/switches directly over a cost effective ultra long 
haul WDM system.

3.  Requirements

There are proposals at T1X1 and ITU [1]-[3] to virtually concatenate VTs
and STSs to make efficient use of SONET based transport for bursty
traffic. However, they do not cover the emerging applications and 
requirements described in this document. These requirements for
concatenating optical channels to enable a carrier grade backbone data
network are as follows:

A.  In order for the concatenation to be truly transparent today and in  
the future, it should be agnostic to:
- Payload types: work with Cell/Packet/TDM or byte stream as the input. 
- Framing protocols used on the optical channels (sub-channels) - 
capability to concatenate optical channels that use any of the 
standardized framing protocols (SONET, OCh, GFP etc.) into one or more 
higher bandwidth super channels.

Damle, et. al.                                                  [Page 4]

Internet Draft draft-damle-optical-channel-concatenation-00.txt Jul 2001

B.  The concatenation should be truly scalable by being independent of:
- Payload data rates
- Transmission data rates - capability to concatenate a set of channels 
at any data rate as long as the data rate is the same within a set.
Variation in optical channel data rate within a concatenated set is 
unlikely in a real network hence the added complexity to accommodate a 
set of variable data rate channels would not be necessary

C.  Keep the overhead to the minimum by optimizing for point-to-point 
network topology since the data traffic demands are essentially 
point-to-point. Low overhead also ensures that there is minimal penalty 
for the concatenation function.

D.  Should have all the carrier class survivability features required to 
make the high bandwidth channels ultra reliable across the long haul 
transmission system and have graceful degradation. We believe the 
following features support carrier class survivability:

- Capability to uniquely identify a concatenated channel as well as
optical sub-channels contained within the concatenated channel
- Capability to monitor degradation per concatenated optical channel 
through BER monitoring and CRCs
- Generalized arrival-time variation compensation
- Capability to add/remove sub-channels automatically without disrupting 
the super channel
- Capability to communicate individual optical channel status to the 
transmit end without the use of separate messages so as to minimize the 
delay in this critical communication
- Capability to de-couple individual optical channel errors from the 
concatenated superchannels and evenly distribute the available bandwidth 
amongst all the payload streams
- Provide capability for extended burn-in testing of individual 
sub-channels
- Provide hooks to support concatenated channel level protection schemes 
under the control of a higher layer
- Capability to guarantee payload arrival sequence (e.g., packet order)

E. Should have the capability to allow the carriers to easily manage and 
service the concatenated super channel and the sub-channels through 
automatic as well as manual provisioning features.
