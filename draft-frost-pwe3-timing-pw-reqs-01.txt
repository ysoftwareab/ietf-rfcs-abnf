     Abstract 
       
     This document describes the requirements for the transmission of 
     network timing and synchronization across packet-switched networks 
     using pseudo-wires.  Such services enable the function of real-time, 
     synchronous applications across the asynchronous packet switched 
     network.  In particular, it complements the emulation of TDM bit 
     streams over the packet switched network.

     1. Introduction 
       
     The PWE3 Working Group has produced several drafts related to the edge-
     to-edge emulation of TDM circuits, e.g. [PWE3-SAToP], [PWE3-CESoPSN] 
     and [PWE3-TDMoIP].  These drafts all rely on the presence of accurate 
     timing at both edges of the network.  Similarly, the use of ATM pseudo-
     wires [PWE3-ATM] to carry AAL1 or AAL2 cells may also require accurate 
     timing at both edges.  This timing may be recovered by some means from 
     the received packet stream, or distributed by some external means. 
       
     This document describes the requirements on distribution of accurate 
     network timing and synchronization over the packet network using 
     pseudo-wires, rather than using the conventional TDM synchronization 
     network.  
       
     It builds on the general requirements for pseudo-wire emulation 
     described in [RFC3916], and the architecture described in [RFC3985].

     2. Terminology and Reference Models  
       
       2.1. Terminology 
       
       The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",  
       "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this  
       document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 
       
       The terms defined in [RFC3985], Section 1.4 are consistently used  
       without additional explanations. 
       
       
       2.2. Reference Model 
       
       The network reference model in Figure 2 of [RFC3985] applies to  
       customer applications requiring timing, where: 
       
       - CE1 is a master clock source of some type 
       - The attachment circuit is a physical means of distributing the  
         clock (for example, it could be a TDM circuit) 
       - CE2 is customer equipment requiring synchronization 
       
       There may be NSP units at both PE units to transform the clock, for  
       example the use of phase-locked loops (PLLs) to generate related  
       clock frequencies. 
       
       Some applications may require a bi-directional link, e.g. the  
       provision of a "time of day" reference.  Other applications only  
       require the provision of a uni-directional link, e.g. those requiring  
       frequency and phase information. 
       
       
       
     3. Aspects of Time and Frequency Synchronization over Packet Networks 
       
     There are three aspects to the distribution of timing and 
     synchronization:  
       
     - Frequency distribution - i.e. the distribution of an accurate 
       frequency reference from one point to another 
       
     - Phase lock - i.e. the limiting of phase wander accumulation between 
       two clocks to a maximum value 
       
     - Time alignment - i.e. the synchronization of absolute time between 
       two or more points 
       
     Different applications require some or all of these three aspects. For 
     example, basestations for a cellular phone network all require to 
     operate at the same frequency (within a tolerance), to allow call 
     handoff from cell to cell.  Traditional wired telecommunication 
     networks require both frequency and phase lock, to eliminate buffer 
     slips.  Third generation CDMA cellular networks require each

     basestation to have an absolute time reference, accurate to within a 
     given tolerance value. 
       
       
       3.1. Current Approaches 
       
       There are existing protocols for distribution of time synchronization 
       over packet networks.  These include NTP (Network Time Protocol, 
       RFC1305), PTP (Precision Time Protocol, IEEE1588), and RTP (Real-time 
       Transfer Protocol, RFC3550). 
       
       NTP was developed for general synchronization of computer clocks over 
       the internet, to an accuracy of 1 to 50 ms. This is not sufficient 
       for many of the applications listed in section 4 below 
       
       IEEE1588 was developed for the industrial machine segment, where a 
       sub-microsecond accuracy was required. However, it was intended to be 
       used over dedicated networks, with specialized hardware to generate, 
       transmit and process the timing packets.  It was not designed with a 
       general-purpose routed network in mind. 
       
       RTP was developed for transmission of real-time services (e.g. voice 
       and video) over a packet network.  As such, the frequency of the 
       clock may be recovered from the arrival rate of packets and knowledge 
       of the clock used to generate the timestamp field, although many 
       applications of RTP do not require such clock recovery.  The accuracy 
       is limited depending on the frequency of the timestamp clock. 
       
       
       3.2 Timing Pseudo-Wires 
       
       The use of pseudo-wires for timing transmission allows for customers 
       of a packet network operator to distribute their own timing in 
       parallel with their data networks.  This timing will be contained 
       within their own pseudo-wires, and hence invisible to other  
       customers.  Therefore multiple customers will be able to distribute 
       independent time services across their own pseudo-wire connections. 
       
       It is possible that existing protocols may be used within the pseudo- 
       wire (e.g. an NTP or IEEE1588 pseudo-wire), although existing 
       protocols may need modification before this is feasible.  It should  
       be noted that both NTP and IEEE15888 are undergoing revision at this  
       time.

     4. Applications  
       
     There are several applications that require timing and synchronization 
     services over packet networks: 
       
     - Cellular phone network infrastructure, for synchronization of 
       basestations to the basestation controller when migrating to a 
       packet-based backhaul infrastructure 
       
     - Use in conjunction with TDM emulation, to improve the quality of 
       timing available over TDM emulation services 
       
     - Real time services, e.g. synchronization of IP PBXs or VoIP gateways, 
       IP video services 
       
     - industrial machines, e.g. synchronization of computer controlled 
       robots over a factory network 
       
     - scientific applications, e.g. synchronization of radio telescopes for 
       long-baseline radio-astronomy 
       
       
       4.1. Cellular Phone Network Infrastructure 
       
       It is becoming common in cellular phone infrastructure to migrate 
       from leased-line TDM connections out to the basestation (e.g. E1 or 
       T1) to a packet-based connection.  This reduces the cost of  
       
       For example, Figure 1 below shows a basestation controller connected  
       to two basestations via an ATM link.  Traditionally this has  
       been carried over a TDM leased line, but in the diagram below this is  
       replaced by a pair of ATM pseudo-wires. 
       
       However, there is still a requirement for time services to the  
       basestation, which is provided naturally by the synchronous nature of  
       the TDM leased line. In this new configuration, a Time Server, driven  
       from the same Primary Reference Source (PRS) as the basestation  
       controller, is shown providing time and synchronization to the  
       basestations via a timing pseudo-wire. 
       
       The performance requirements for the cellular infrastructure  
       application varies depending on the type of cellular network. GSM and  
       UMTS FDD networks simply require accurate frequency distribution,  
       since there is a maximum frequency difference of 50ppb (parts per  
       billion) allowed between adjacent cells to permit efficient call  
       handoff. CDMA and UMTS TDD networks additionally require absolute  
       time synchronization of better than 10us.

       The following figures show how the use of a timing pseudo-wire can be  
       used in conjunction with the various synchronization scenarios for  
       TDM emulation described in [RFC4197], section 4.3.  The clock  
       notation relates to the network synchronization reference model shown  
       in Figure 1 of [RFC4197].

     o Relative Network Scenario 
       
       The common network reference clock "I" is available to both PE  
       devices, via transmission over pseudo-wire PW3. 
       
       Clocks "A" and "G" are generated locally without reference to a 
       common clock. 
       
       Timing information (the difference between the common reference 
       clock "I" and the incoming clock "A" or "G") is explicitly 
       transferred from the ingress PE to the egress PE. 
       
       Clocks "E" and "J" (the TDM output clocks at the egress PE - see 
       Fig. 1 of [RFC4197]) are generated in reference to the common  
       clock "I" using the timing information received from the ingress PE. 
       
       In a slight modification of this scenario, one (but not both) of the  
       CE devices may use its receive clock as its transmission clock (i.e.  
       use loop timing).

     o Adaptive Network Scenario 
       
       The adaptive network scenario does not require the presence of a 
       common clock at either CE or PE devices.  Therefore it does not 
       require the use of a timing pseudo-wire.

     5. Requirements 
       
     The requirements on Timing and Synchronization pseudo-wires may be 
     divided into the following groups: 
       
     - Performance requirements 
     - Connectivity and Compatibility Requirements 
     - Robustness requirements 
     - Redundancy requirements 
     - Security requirements 
       
       
       5.1. Performance Requirements 
       
       In general, performance requirements are dependent on the  
       application.  Some applications will have much stricter requirements  
       on the quality of the clock than others.  Therefore this document  
       will not attempt to define performance requirements, but leave this  
       to the relevant documents describing the various applications. 
       
       For example, Study Group 15, Question 13 of ITU is working on a  
       recommendation called [G.8261] that analyses synchronization  
       aspects for the transmission of TDM circuits over a packet network.   
       This document will set out the requirements for the synchronization  
       function of network elements where it is intended to connect such  
       services into the TDM network. 
       
       
       5.2. Robustness requirements 
       
       The robustness of the clock recovery mechanism depends upon the 
       proper handling of the following packet network effects: 
       
       - Packet loss 
       - Out-of-order delivery 
       - Absolute delay 
       - Packet delay variation (PDV) 
       - Congestion events 
       - Connection defects 
       
          5.2.1. Packet loss 
       
          The encapsulation layer MUST allow the egress PE to minimise the 
          effect of lost timing packets on the clock recovery process, 
          without requiring retransmission of the original packet. 
       
          5.2.2. Out-of-order delivery 
       
          The encapsulation layer MUST allow the egress PE to minimise the 
          effect of out-of-order delivery of timing packets on the clock  
          recovery process. 
       
       
       
     Frost et al.            Expires September 2006                [Page 9] 
     Internet Draft    draft-frost-pwe3-timing-pw-reqs-01        March 2006 
       
          5.2.3. Absolute delay 
       
          The recovery of the clock MUST provide the ability to compensate  
          for absolute delay, whererequired by the application (e.g. for  
          those applications that require an absolute time reference). 
          Delay compensation MUST be achieved while maintaining jitter and 
          wander of the egress end service clock within tolerances specified  
          in the normative references for the application. 
       
          5.2.4. Delay Variation 
       
          Delay variation in packet networks is caused by a number of 
          different mechanims, including competition for resources within 
          network elements, output queuing, QoS mechanisms such as traffic  
          shaping, quantisation effects caused by the underlying physical  
          layer technology etc. 
       
          The recovery of the clock MUST provide for ability to compensate 
          for packet delay variation while maintaining jitter and wander of 
          the egress end service clock within tolerances specified in the 
          normative references for the application. 
       
          In particular, clocks to be used in the TDM network have  
          requirements on wander to be maintained within tolerance over very  
          long periods of time.  As such, the clock recovery mechanism 
          SHOULD be immune to very low frequency packet delay variation, 
          such as that caused by different network usage levels throughout 
          the day. 
       
          5.2.5. Congestion Control 
       
          Unlike TDM circuits, the transfer of timing and synchronization  
          does not require a constant packet rate.  Therefore, some means of 
          responding to congestion by reducing traffic load SHOULD be 
          provided, including in the limit, the ability to temporarily shut 
          down a Timing PW when severe congestion has been detected. 
       
          The egress PE MUST provide some means of maintaining the timing  
          and synchronization service to the CE under these conditions, e.g.  
          by providing "holdover" capability. 
       
          Further congestion considerations are discussed in chapter 6.5 of 
          [RFC3985]. 
       
          5.2.6. Connection Defects 
       
          Misconnected packets are defined as packets that have been wrongly 
          identified as belonging to this pseudo-wire.  If such packets pass 
          the classification stage, they may be identified by checking the  
          values of additional header fields, for example checking for an  
          invalid source address, cookie value or SSRC value. 
       
       
       
     Frost et al.            Expires September 2006               [Page 10] 
     Internet Draft    draft-frost-pwe3-timing-pw-reqs-01        March 2006 
       
          Malformed packets are defined as packets that have passed the  
          classification stage and misconnection checks, but that are 
          malformed in some way, e.g. wrong length, or incorrect header or  
          payload format. 
       
          The encapsulation layer for timing PWs SHOULD, separately or in  
          conjunction with the lower layers of the PWE3 stack, provide the 
          ability to detect, report and discard both misconnected and  
          malformed packets.  
       
       
       5.3. Redundancy requirements 
       
       Timing and synchronization are heavily protected services in TDM  
       networks, and a redundancy strategy to allow failover to an  
       alternative timing source is always provided. 
       
          5.3.1. Redundancy and Failover 
       
          The ability for an egress PE to switch to an alternative timing  
          source MUST be provided.  This alternative source MAY be another  
          packet timing connection, or an alternative physical clock source.   
          The switchover between the two MUST be transparent, so that the  
          timing and synchronization service is not affected. 
       
          Any resulting phase transient generated in the output clock MUST  
          be within the tolerances for a clock re-arrangement operation 
          specified in the normative references for the application. 
       
          5.3.2. Synchronization quality indication 
       
          The encapsulation layer SHOULD provide some means of indicating  
          the quality level of a clock to downstream equipment.  This SHOULD  
          include indication of whether the master clock source has failed,  
          and as a result gone into a holdover condition.  This indication  
          MAY be used by the egress PE to decide whether to switch over to  
          an alternative clock source, if available. 
       
       
       
     6. Security Considerations 
       
     The security considerations in [RFC3916] are fully applicable to the 
     transmission of network timing and synchronization.  The ability to 
     disrupt synchronization services could be used as a key to disrupting 
     an entire network, and especially any real-time services carried over 
     the network.  Therefore it is particularly important to know where a 
     source of packet timing is coming from, and whether it is genuine.  
     Therefore, it MUST be possible to provide some means of authentication 
     of timing PWs.   
       
     In addition these services are sensitive to packet delay variation, and 
     need to be protected from this as a method of attack.
