              Use of IPFIX for Export of Per-Packet Information 

     Abstract 
         
        This document describes the usage of the IP Flow Information 
        Export (IPFIX) protocol for the case of exporting and processing 
        per-packet information.  
        The main idea is to separate the export of the information about 
        packets and flows those packets belong to, using two different 
        records. The association between the records is kept using 
        unique Flow or Template Identifiers.

     1. Introduction 
         
        In the scope of passive QoS Measurements, there is often the 
        need to exchange and export measurement data in a finer 
        granularity then per flows. One typical application is passive 
        One-Way-Delay measurement; this draft takes it as example when 
        demonstrating the need for information export on a per-packet 
        basis. 
         
        The IPFIX protocol however, has been designed to export flow 
        records. A possible approach to export packet records using 
        IPFIX could be exporting flow records containing information 
        about single packets. This method has been proposed by the PSAMP 
        working group in [PSAMP-PROTO]. Exporting flow related 
        information per-packet introduces a high degree of redundancy. 
        This draft shows how packet information and flow information can 
        be efficiently exported and related using IPFIX. 
      
      
     2. Terminology 
      
        Collecting Process 
            The collecting process receives records of flow or packet 
            information. The data is stored for later processing (by 
            the calculation process) 
         
        Exporting Process 
            The exporting processes send flow and packet records to the 
            collecting processes. The records are generated by the 
            measurement process. 
         
        Filtering  
            Filtering selects a subset of packets by applying 
            deterministic functions on parts of the packet content like 
            header fields or parts of the payload. A filtering process

            needs to process the packet (look at packet header and/or 
            payload) in order to make the selection decision. 
         
        Measurement Device 
            A measurement device has access to at least one observation 
            point. It is hosting at least one measurement process and 
            one export process. 
         
        Metering/Measurement Process  
            The measurement process generates records of packet and 
            flow information. Packets passing the observation point are 
            captured, time stamped, filtered and classified. The 
            measurement process calculates the packet Ids.

        NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",

        described in RFC 2119. 
      
      
     3. General Problem Statement 
         
        In [IPFIX-PROTO] the IPFIX working group has defined a protocol 
        to transport measurement data containing flow information. 
         
        The main purpose of the protocol is to exchange information 
        about IP traffic flows. In this scope a flow is defined by a set 
        of key attributes (source/destination address, 
        source/destination port, Layer3 Protocol Type, TOS/DSCP byte, 
        interface of the flow exporting network element). As such, a 
        flow is a collection of packets that share a set of common 
        attributes. 
         
        However, for a number of metrics there is a need to export 
        per-packet data.  
         
        A single packet could be considered a special case of a flow and 
        thus, per-packet information could be exported using flow 
        records. Doing this though would have consequences on the 
        efficiency of the exporting procedure, as it would mean 
        additional overhead. Packets belonging to the same flow share 
        common attributes, i.e. source address, destination address, 
        etc. Exporting these attributes on a per-packet basis, each time 
        with a different packet ID, would be redundant information. 
         
        There are cases however, where it is desirable to keep flow 
        information along with the per-packet information, that is, when 
        analyzing packet characteristics while observing flows. This 
        document proposes a solution that reduces the overhead caused by 
        the flow properties while keeping a link to flow information. 
         
        The proposed method does not need any changes to the IPFIX 
        protocol. 
         
     4. Export Per-Packet Information 
         
        Figure 1 depicts three packets belonging to flow A and one 
        packet belonging to flow B, respectively. It shows export 
        records containing packet information plus flow information 
        (source and destination address). Undoubtedly, the flow 
        information introduces a huge amount of redundancy, as it is 
        repeated for every packet in every record. Minimizing the 
        redundancy is a common problem in relational data base design

              Use of IPFIX for Export of Per-Packet Information 

        and we apply here similar solutions to those proposed in that 
        area.  
         
        In Figure 2 we separate flow from packet information. In order 
        to maintain the relation between Packet Properties and Flow 
        Properties we introduce indices (idxA and idxB) for the Flow 
        Properties that are unique for all Flow Property entries. The 
        purpose of the indices is to serve as "primary key" that 
        identifies rows of the Flow Properties. More details about these 
        indices will be given in section 5. The rows are then referenced 
        by the Packet Properties by using the appropriate value for the 
        flow identifier. The linkage of one packet and flow B (srcB, 
        dstB, idxB) is explicitly drawn.

        Figure 2: Flow information and packet information 
         
         
        The IPFIX protocol is template based like NetFlow version 9. For 
        a complete description of features of IPFIX refer to [IPFIX-
        PROTO].  
        Templates define the structure of data to be exported, 
        describing data fields together with their type and meaning. 
        IPFIX specifies two types of records to export data: data 
        records and option data records. These records are defined via 
        template records and option template records. To export per-
        packet-information we define two different templates: an option 
        template for Flow Properties and a template for Packet 
        Properties. 
         
        Figure 3 shows the relation between template and data sets for          
        packet and flow properties. The Flow Properties option template 
        defines the attributes for a flow; e.g. IP source and 
        destination address and the flowID. The flowID is a unique 
        identifier for a flow; this field allows packet records to 
        reference flow attributes. Subsequent option data records of 
        this template define the actual flows. The reference could be 
        alternatively provided by the TemplateID, as explained in 
        Section 5.

              Use of IPFIX for Export of Per-Packet Information 

        The format for the information related to single packets is 
        defined in the Packet Properties template. This information is 
        packet specific and normally not shared between many packets. 
        Otherwise one would rather consider the information as flow 
        related and therefore it needs not be exported in every record.

        The Flow Properties option data records SHOULD be sent prior to 
        the corresponding Packet Properties data records. 
         
         
     5. Using Scopes 
         
        Flow Properties are sent via IPFIX option records. IPFIX option 
        records contain one or more scope fields. The Flow Properties 
        record can contain the FlowID and/or the TemplateID as scope 
        fields. There are three options: 
         
        1) Use FlowID as scope 
          The flow properties are valid for all data records containing 
          that flowID. This solution limits the number of different 
          flows that can be exported at the same tame in the same 
          observation domain to 2**32 (using 32 bits flowIDs) 
        2) Use FlowID and TemplateID as scope 
          The flow properties are valid only for data records referring 
          to the template specified by the TemplateIDand containing 
          that flowID. This allows the export up to 2**32 flows per 
          template. The solution is to be chosen when the number of 
          flows to be exported is expected to be very high (and beyond 
          the limit posed by solution 1) 
        3) Use TemplateID as scope 
           The flow properties are valid for all data records of the 
           specified template. In this case flowIDs are not needed but 
           the exporting process requires a templateID per flow. In the 
           general case this solution is not scalable but can be 
           suitable for certain applications (e.g. flow aggregation). 
         
         
     6. FlowID Management 
         
        The management of FlowIDs is very similar to the management of 
        TemplateIDs described in [IPFIX-PROTO]. The Exporting Process 
        assigns and maintains the FlowIDs for the exporter's Observation 
        Domains. Like templateIDs, a FlowID MUST be unique per 
        Observation Domain (source identifier in the IPFIX header). 
        Different Observation Domains from the same exporter may use the 
        same FlowID value to refer to different flows.  
        There are no constraints regarding the order of the Flow ID 
        allocation. When limiting the scope to special templates, the 
        flowIDs have to be unique per Observation Domain and template.

              Use of IPFIX for Export of Per-Packet Information 

         
        Using 32 bit flow IDs allows the export of 2**32 active flows in 
        parallel. FlowIDs have a certain lifetime inside which they 
        cannot be reused. After that time a FlowID can be assigned to 
        another flow. FlowID whose lifetime has expired from longer 
        SHOULD be preferred. The lifetime MUST be configurable. 
         
        The collecting process associates a lifetime with each flowID. 
        The lifetime MUST be configurable. The mapping of data records 
        to flow properties uses the most recent flow definition of the 
        specified FlowID. If there is no flow definition of that FlowID 
        or the lifetime of the flow definition has been expired, no 
        mapping is possible. In this case the collecting process SHOULD 
        log an error.  
         
        When IPFIX uses an unreliable transport protocol to export the 
        option data records containing the flow properties and the 
        flowIDs these records MUST be re-sent at regular intervals, 
        whose frequency MUST be configurable.  
         
        When using a connection oriented transport protocol the flow 
        properties have to be re-sent after a connection re-
        establishment in prior to the corresponding Packet Properties 
        data records. 
         
         
     7. Example of Per-Packet Information Export 
         
        To demonstrate how to use IPFIX efficiently to export per-packet 
        information, this section proposes how to use the IPFIX protocol 
        for exporting flow information and per-packet information (in 
        this case related to a long-lived flow) for OWD computation.   
         
        In order to acquire a One-Way path delay information, two 
        measurement points with synchronized clocks must exist, one at 
        each end of the path under examination. Both measurement points 
        will capture packets, assign them timestamps and generate an 
        identifier for a packet passing that point. Each measurement 
        point will export its measurement data to a collecting process 
        where the data are correlated based on the packet identifiers 
        and timestamps and then the delay is calculated as a difference 
        of two timestamps of a packet pair. 
         
        The templates that would be needed for exporting measurement 
        data of this kind are illustrated in the figures below. 
        Figure 4 shows the option template containing the information 
        concerning flows using the FlowID as scope.  
         
        In the Flow Properties template we export the following 
        Information Elements: 
         
          - the source IPv4 Address, sourceIPv4Address [IPFIX-INFO], 
            with a type of 8 and a length of 4 octets 
           
          - the destination IPv4 Address, destinationIPv4Address 
            [IPFIX-INFO], with a type of 8 and a length of 4 octets 
           
          - the Class of Service field, ClassOfServiceIPv4 [IPFIX-
            INFO], with a type of 5 and a length of 1 octet 
           
          -  source and destination ports, transportSourcePort and 
            transportDestinationPort [IPFIX-INFO]with a type of 7 and 
            11 respectively, and a length of 2 octets each 
           
        The flow identifier, which is represented by the FlowId 
        Information Element [IPFIX-INFO], is used as the Scope Field.

        Figure 4: Example Flow Properties Template 
         
         
        For passive One-Way-Delay measurement, the Packet Properties 
        template consists of at least Timestamp and Packet ID. 
        Additionally, this template contains a flow identifier field. In 
        packet records, the value of this field will contain one of the 
        unique indices of the flow records exported before. 
         
        Figure 5 displays the template with the packet properties. In 
        this example we export the following Information Elements: 
         
          - FlowID [IPFIX-INFO] with a length of 4 octets 
         
          - packetTimestamp, packetID, and packetLength. Since 
            packetID, packetLength and flowID are not (yet) IETF-
            defined information elements, we export them as enterprise-
            specific IEs. The three IEs have respectively a type of 
            220, 221, and 222 and a length of 8, 4, an 4 octets.

              Use of IPFIX for Export of Per-Packet Information 

         
         
        The delay is derived by a calculation step: at the collection 
        point packet records of two measurement points are gathered and 
        correlated by means of the packet ID. The resulting delay data 
        records are exported in a similar manner as the packet data have 
        been. Especially, the linkage between delay data and flow 
        information is represented with the discussed flow identifier 
        fields. The OWD properties contain the Packet Pair ID (which is 
        the packet ID matching that of the two contributing packet 
        records), a timestamp (which is the timestamp of the packet 
        passing the reference monitor point) in order to reconstruct a 
        time series, the calculated delay value, and finally a flow 
        identifier. 
         
     8. IPFIX for per-packet information export and PSAMP 
         
        In [PSAMP-PROTO] the PSAMP working group proposes to use IPFIX 
        to export packet information from a PSAMP Exporting Process to a 
        PSAMP Collecting Process. Even though no new version of the 
        draft has been produced so far the solution seems to be accepted 
        from the group.  
        While IPFIX is well suited for the purpose due to the good match 
        between the IPFIX and PSAMP architectures and to the fact that 
        IPFIX satisfies PSAMP requirements, the described approach has a 
        high degree of redundancy. It proposes to treat packets as flows 
        and export per-packet information using flow records.  
        We propose to use the solution described in this draft to 
        efficiently export PSAMP packet information. 
         
     9. Export and evaluation considerations 
         
        The main advantage of this proposed method to export per-packet 
        information is the reduced amount of measurement data that has 
        to be transferred from the exporter to the collector. In 
        addition there is less storage capacity needed at the collector 
        side. 
         
        On the other hand there is some extra processing power needed on 
        the exporter side to manage flow information and to assign 
        packets to flows. The collector has to process records of two 
        templates instead of just one but has to read and write less 
        data. Additional effort is needed when post processing the 
        measurement data, because now the correlation of flow and packet 
        information is needed. 
         
        In the above example (see Figure 5) using IPFIX to export the 
        measurement data for each received packet 30 bytes have to be 
        transferred (sourceAddressV4=4, destinationAddressV4=4, 
        classOfServiceV4=1, protocolIdentifier=1, transportSourcePort=2, 
        transportDestionationPort=2, packetTimestamp=8, packetID=4, 
        packetLength=4). Disregarding the IPFIX protocol overhead a flow 
        of 1000 packets produces 28000 bytes of measurement data. Using 
        the proposed optimization each packet produces an export of only 
        20 bytes (packetTimestamp=8, packetID=4, packetLength=4, 
        flowID=4). The export of the flow information produces 16 bytes 
        (sourceAddressV4=4, destinationAddressV4=4, classOfServiceV4=1, 
        protocolIdentifier=1, transportSourcePort=2, 
        transportDestionationPort=2, flowID =4). For a flow of 1000 
        packet this sums up to 16016 bytes. This is a decrease of more 
        than 40 percent.

     11. Security Considerations 
         
        For the proposed use of the IPFIX protocol for export of 
        per-packet information the security considerations as for the 
        IPFIX protocol apply.
