1.  Introduction

   The generalized packet/message format [PacketBB] specifies a
   signaling format which MANET routing protocols can employ for
   exchanging protocol information.  This format presents the ability to
   express and associate attributes to packets, messages or addresses,
   by way of a general TLV (type-length-value) mechanism.

   This document specifies a Mobility TLV structure, which MAY be used
   by any MANET routing protocol that needs to exchange geolocalization
   information using the generalized MANET packet/message format.
   Depending on the configuration, this allows a receiving node to
   obtain the position, the azimuth or the velocity of a sending node if
   it is used as a message or packet TLV.  If it is used as an address
   block TLV, it allows a receiving node to obtain the position, the
   azimuth or the velocity of nodes different from the sending node.

2.  Terminology

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
      in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

      Additionally, this document uses the terminology from [PacketBB],
      and introduces the following terminology

   GPS -  Global Positioning System.  A geolocalization system
      developped and operated by the US Department of Defense that is
      able to provide accurate worldwide coordinates of devices equiped
      with GPS receivers.  A similar European system is currently under
      developpement under the name of Galileo.  The GPS system does not
      work without a clear access to at least 3 satellites, thus is
      inoperable for indoor positioning.

   GPS-free Positioning -  A set of techniques that has been developped
      in order to provide a mean of localization in situation when a
      clear access to satellites is not possible.  Most of the methods
      uses multilateration techniques and requires either a formal
      training, or an anchor node that knows its accurate position.

   Time -  The universal GPS time expressed in seconds.

   Longitude -  The longitude describes the location of a place on Earth
      east or west of a north-south line called the Prime Meridian
      located in Greenwich, UK.  Longitude is given as an angular
      measurement ranging from 0 degree at the Prime Meridian to +180
      degree eastward and -180 degree westward.

   Latitude -  The latitude gives the location of a place on Earth north
      or south of the equator.  Latitude is an angular measurement
      ranging from 0 degree at the Equator to 90 degree at the poles.

   Elevation -  The elevation is the altitude of an object from a known
      level or datum.  Common datums are mean sea level and the surface
      of the WGS-84 geoid, used by GPS.

   Azimuth -  Azimuth is the horizontal component of a direction,
      measured around the horizon, from the north toward the east in the
      northern hemisphere, and from the south toward the west in the
      southern hemisphere.

   Mobility -  mobility information related to a specific address, which
      MAY consist of a longitude, latitude or elevation, a velocity, an
      azimuth, or the time this mobility information has been sampled.

   Stability -  a measure of the similarity between a node's sampled
      (past) mobility parameters and the actual ones.

3.  Applicability Statement

   The TLV structure described in this document is applicable whenever
   the position, the velocity or the azimuth of a node or of a set of
   nodes is required in a MANET protocol using the generalized MANET
   packet/message format [PacketBB].

4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning

   This specification does not describe a protocol, nor does it mandate
   specific node or protocol behavior.  Rather, it describes mechanisms
   for encoding geolocalization parameters using the TLV mechanism of
   [PacketBB].

   Protocols using the TLVs specified in this documents MUST transmit
   geolocalization information of the sending node using a message or
   packet TLV, while general geolocalization information of other nodes
   MUST be encoded using a TLV block.

5.  General Mobility TLV Structure

   This specification defines the content and the structure of a
   Mobility TLV, which may be a packet, a message, or an address block
   TLV.  In all cases, a Mobility TLV is always a single value TLV as
   specified in [PacketBB].

   All TLVs are conformed to the following specification:


              <tlv> = <tlv-type>
                      <tlv-semantic>
                      <index-start>?
                      <index-stop>?
                      <length>?
                      <value>?


   using the regular syntax of [PacketBB].

   The <value> field of a Mobility TLV is encoded according to the
   following layout


              <value> = {<value-semantic><mobility>}*


   where:

      <value-semantic> is an 8 bit field which describes the stucture of
      the <mobility> tag.

      bit 0 (position bit):  TLV with this bit cleared ('0') does not
         contain the position of the address in the respective address
         block.  TLVs with this bit set ('1') contains position
         information.

      bit 1 (velocity bit):  TLV with this bit cleared ('0') does not
         contain the velocity of the address in the respective address
         block.  TLVs with this bit set ('1') contains the velocity.

      bit 2 (azimuth bit):  TLV with this bit cleared ('0') does not
         contain the azimuth of the address in the respective address
         block.  TLVs with this bit set ('1') contains the azimuth.

Internet-Draft          MANET Position Signaling           February 2007


      bit 3 (stability bit):  TLV with this bit cleared ('0') does not
         contain the stability of the address in the respective address
         block.  TLVs with this bit set ('1') contains the stability.

      bits 4-7 are RESERVED  They MUST be cleared ('0')to be in
         conformance with this version of the specification.

      <mobility> is a field containing the mobility parameters.  The
      length of this field may be obtained from the <value-semantic>
      field.  The <mobility> field is specified by:


              <mobility> = {<pos>?<azi>?<velo>?<stab><time>}


         <pos> is an 96 bit field containing the coordinates of a node
         following the general layout


              <pos> = <Longitude><Latitude><Elevation>


         <velo> is an 8 bit field containing the node's velocity in m/s

         <azi> is an 8 bit field containing the node's azimuth in degree

         <stab> is an 8 bit field containing the node's stability ,
         which represents the node eagerness to keep the current
         mobility parameters, and which MAY be used as a measure of the
         relative confidence of the mobility parameters.

         <time> is an 64 bit field containing the GPS time in seconds
         when these mobility parameters have been sampled.  In
         conjunction with <stab>, it MAY be able to provide a confidence
         predictor of the mobility parameters.

5.1.  Constraints

   o  If the bit <azi> is set ('1'), the bit <velo> MUST also be set
      ('1').

   o  Each mobility parameter applies to a single and unique address.

6.  Representing Time

   This document specifies a TLV structure in which time values are used
   to represent the sampling time of the geolocalization data.  As no
   synchronization assumption is defined in this document, the time
   shared by all nodes implementing this document MUST be the GPS time.

   GPS (Global Positioning System) time is the atomic time scale
   implemented by the atomic clocks in the GPS ground control stations
   and the GPS satellites themselves.  GPS time is expressed as a number
   of seconds since the beginning of the GPS epoch on Sunday January 6th
   1980 at 0:00 UTC.

   of the Mobility TLVs in this document, and the bit-layout Mobility
   TLVs actually exchanged between nodes.
