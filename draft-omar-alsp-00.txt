RFC            ASN Label Switching Protocol (ALSP)   April 16, 2020


1.  Introduction


    - ASN Label Switching Protocol (ALSP) is a wide-area network (WAN)
      protocol that is used to connect an Enterprise's local-area networks
      (LANs) through Service Provider's network.
    - ALSP can be used to connect different Enterpises' networks as well
      that uses overlapped private IPv4 addresses.
    - ALSP depends on the unique ASN assigned to each organization.
    - ALSP is similar to the MPLS concept but much more simpler.  


2.  ALSP Header


  - ALSP adds the following header to the IP packet:

                  +-+-+-+-+-+-+
                  |    ASN    |
                  +-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     32-bits

 - ASN is the Autonomous System Number.


3.  ASN Label Switching Protocol (ALSP)


    - Consider the following two enterprise sites that are connected
      through an ALSP Cloud of routers:


  Customer-A                 SP-1                  Customer-A
    Site-1                ALSP Colud                Site-2
    ASN-100                 ASN-300                 ASN-100 
  
 *************          ****************          *************
 *10.1.1.0/24*          *              *          *           *
 *           *CE1    PE1*              *PE2    CE2*           *
 *   IGP-1 * x *o----o* x *  IGP-2   * x *o----o* x *  IGP-3  *
 *           *   eBGP   *              *   eBGP   *           *
 *           *          *              *          *           *
 *************          ****************          *************

    Sample Network for Connecting an Enterprise with Two Sites


Where:

  - CE: Customer Edge.
  - PE: Provider Edge.
  - ASN: Autonomous System Number.
  - IGP: Interior Gateway Protocol.
  - eBGP: External Boarder Gateway Protocol.  

  - CE1 has ALSP enabled on the interface connected to PE1.
  - Similarly, CE2 has ALSP enabled on the interface connected
    to PE2.
  - Also, all the ALSP cloud routers have ALSP enabled globally.
  - ALSP enabled interface means that the IGP or EGP advertisements
    through this interface can have the ALSP header which is the ASN
    configured on the IGP or EGP.
  - Consider that Customer-A's Site-1 has a subnet 10.1.1.0/24 that
    needs to be advertised to Site-2.
  - The 10.1.1.0/24 subnet is learned by CE1 through IGP-1.
  - The engineer first should advertise this subnet through BGP and
    MUST configure the ASN so it can be added to the advertised update
    messages.
  - When PE1 receives the BGP update with ASN 100, if it doesn't have
    a VRF table for ASN-100, AUTOMATICALLY it will create a VRF instance
    with a naming convention VRF-ASN, so in this case it will be VRF-100.

RFC             ASN Label Switching Protocol (ALSP)   April 16, 2020



  - Now, PE1 has a VRF-100 table with 10.1.1.0/24 learned by BGP.
  - The engineer MUST redistribute BGP into IGP-2 and adds the ASN
    of Customer-A to the configuration.
  - Through IGP-2, all routers within ASN-300 will learn about the
    subnet 10.1.1.0/24.
  - Each router within the ALSP cloud receives the update takes
    one of the following actions:

     a) If there is no VRF table for that ASN, it will create one
        and add the learned subnet to that VRF table.
     b) If there is already created VRF table for that ASN, it will
        only add the learned subnet to that VRF table.

  - Now, consider that PE2 received the update through IGP-2 and it
    has not any VRF for that ASN that is associated with the update
    message, it will create a new VRF table called VRF-100 and add
    10.1.1.0/24 to that table.
  - Now, the engineer should advertise 10.1.1.0/24 subnet to CE2 using
    BGP and MUST configure the ASN of that VRF.
  - When CE2 receives 10.1.1.0/24 subnet with ASN-100 in the header 
    via BGP, the engineer MUST redistribute the BGP learned subnet
    into IGP-3 normally.
