Abstract

   This memo defines a [XML] Document Type Definition (DTD) that
   corresponds to the vCard, electronic business card format defined by
   [VCARD]. This DTD provides equivalent functionality to the standard
   format defined by [VCARD].

   xml@imc.org". Send an email to "ietf-vcard-xml-request@imc.org" with

1.      Introduction

   The Extended Markup Language (XML) as defined in [XML] is gaining
   widespread attention as a "web friendly" syntax for encoding and
   exchanging documents and data on the Internet. This interest includes
   requests for and discussion of possible document type definitions
   (DTD) for IETF standards such at the vCard, electronic business card
   format define by [VCARD].

   While there is some merit to the argument that multiple encodings of
   an object seldom provide more utility than to provide an additional
   obstacle to interoperability or to provide unnecessary alternatives
   to implementation teams, this document is intended to minimize both

Internet Draft             vCard v3.0 XML DTD             July 19, 1998


   of these faults by introducing an XML equivalent form of the vCard
   specification defined by the IETF ASID WORKing Group. By introducing
   this DTD to the same body that formulated the IETF vCard
   specification, it is hoped that the XML encoding does not evolve in
   incompatible ways with the MIME content type for vCard.

   The vCard DTD does not introduce any capability not expressible in
   the format defined by [VCARD]. However, an attempt has been made to
   leverage the capabilities of the XML syntax to better articulate the
   original intent of the vCard authors.

   The vCard DTD promotes a number of vCard properties into attributes
   on the "vCard" element. This has been done to express these
   properties as "global attributes" for the vCard object, as a whole.
   For example, the VERSION, REV, PRODID, UID, CLASS properties have
   been "mapped" into attributes on the vCard object.

   XML does not support a mixing of XML and non-XML content in a single
   XML entity. These two notations need to be separated into different
   entities. As such, the content information for the PHOTO, LOGO, SOUND
   and KEY properties are specified through external entity references.
   There is no inline binary content in a XML encoded vCard.

   The [VCARD] specification defines a strongly typed object format.
   This level of data typing is difficult to express in XML content
   models. However, an attempt has been made to convey a data typing
   through a "value" attribute on the property elements. However, unlike
   the [VCARD] specification, the element content is expressed as a
   single data type. Since the XML content model does easily provide a
   method for "typing" of content, data integrity checking of a XML
   encoded vCard is the responsibility of the XML application supporting
   this DTD.

3.      vCard v3.0 Notation

   A XML document can reference an external non-XML entity containing a
   vCard v3.0 object, as specified by [VCARD]. The vCard v3.0 object,
   while encoded in the standard, non-XML format can be referenced in an
   external entity reference that identifies the [VCARD] format in a
   notation declaration. The [VCARD] format is identified by the formal
   public identifier "-//IETF//NONSGML vCard version 3.0//EN", as
   defined in [FPI].

4.      Example Usage

4.1     Simple vCard

4.5     XML document reference to a non-XML vCard

   The following is an example of a XML document with a proper reference
   to a non-XML entity containing a vCard object in the format defined

   integrated into XML documents without any delay.

5.      Open DTD Design Issues

   The following issues remain open for discussion in the design of the
   DTD:

   . New lines in "label" and "note" elements are specified with the
     "br" empty content element. Should this be specified with a
     processor instruction instead?

   . How should the ability to specify multiple vCard objects within a
     document be specified?

   . The VERSION, REV, PRODID, UID, CLASS properties were mapped to
     attributes on the "vCard" element, rather than separate vCard
     content particles. This seemed to be the optimal method to elevate
     the semantic of these as global attributes on the vCard as a
     whole.

   . Rather than allow the "n" element's "given" content particle to be
     repeatable, multiple given names will appear within a single
     "given" element. For example, "<given>Jose Maria Jesus</given>".
     This approach will avoid the ambiguity of understanding which
     given name is "primary" when multiple "given" elements are
     specified.

   . Is the "property.component" form of naming content particle
     elements too verbose? For example, family, given, n.otr, etc.

   . Should the content model for "extadd" have the "*, optional and
     repeatable" or should it have the "?, optional and not repeatable"
     occurrence indicator?

   . Should the content model for "street" have the "*, optional and
     repeatable" or should it have the "?, optional and not repeatable"
     occurrence indicator?

   . Is any EMPTY content model for "photo", "logo" and "sound"
     elements (but with appropriate attributes) WORKable?

Internet Draft             vCard v3.0 XML DTD             July 19, 1998


   . Should the "photo", "logo" and "sound" elements have the
     "img.type" and "aud.type" (respectively) attribute to designate
     the IANA registered media type for the entity? Or is this
     information already provided by the NDATA (which must be specified
     in a vCard document that includes these elements) adequate? The
     NDATA will require a NOTATION definition.

   . Is NMTOKENS the way to define the "del.type" and "tel.type"
     attributes?

   . Should we provide a "grouping" mechanism in the property elements?
     For example: <adr group="vacation"> and <tel group="vacation">.

   . The "agent" element is defined with a "vCard" content particle.
     Should this be redefined as an element with empty content and an
     attribute that references an external entity? In XML, won't this
     require the external entity be defined with a NDATA (non-XML)
     content? This is not what we want. We want the "agent" content to
     be parsed "vCard" character data.

   . Should "sort-string" element name be shortened to "sort".

   . Should the "key" be defined as an external entity reference or is
     there a more PREFerred content model that should be used?

   . When the XML vCard is conveyed in a MIME message, are there
     special vCard properties that ought to be conveyed as attributes
     on the Content-Type MIME header field?
