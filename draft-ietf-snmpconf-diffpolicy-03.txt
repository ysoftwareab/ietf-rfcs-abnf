   between high-level "network-wide" policy definitions that affect
   configuration of the differentiated services (DiffServ) subsystem and
   the instance-specific information that would include such details as
   the parameters for all the queues associated with each interface in a
   system.  This essentially provides an interface for configuring
   DiffServ at a conceptually higher layer than that of the DiffServ
   Architecture MIB [DIFFSERVMIB].

   This version of this memo is aligned with the DIFF-SERV-MIB
   [DIFFSERVMIB] found in draft-ietf-diffserv-mib-06.txt.  This MIB
   module will be aligned with that work as updates are made.


2.  The SNMP Management Framework


   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

     o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

     o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events
         for the purpose of management. The first version of this
         Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1
         and described in RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215
         [4]. The second version, called SMIv2, is described in
         RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].

     o   Message protocols for transferring management
         information. The first version of the SNMP message
         protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in RFC 1157
         [8]. A second version of the SNMP message protocol,
         which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
         called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC
         1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is
         called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572
         [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

     o   Protocol operations for accessing management
         information. The first set of protocol operations and
         associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1157 [8]. A
         second set of protocol operations and associated PDU
         formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

     o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14]

         and the view-based access control mechanism described
         in RFC 2575 [15].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine-readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.


3.  Introduction


   This memo defines a MIB module which can be used to convey
   information about desired network-wide DiffServ-based policy
   behavior.  This module is designed to integrate with the Policy-based
   Management MIB module [POLICYMIB] as well as the DiffServ
   Architecture MIB module [DIFFSERVMIB] published by the DiffServ
   working group.  Together, these three documents represent an instance
   of an integrated architecture for both device-specific and network-
   wide policy management which is fully integrated with the Internet
   Standard Management Framework.

   This is the first of what is expected to be a wide number of other
   network-wide policy modules to be developed in the future in a wide
   range of areas.

   Within the DiffServ architecture a MIB module is already defined
   [DIFFSERVMIB] that operates on a device level.  The MIB module in
   this memo (the DIFFSERV-POLICY-MIB) creates a coherent policy
   configuration management view (domain-specific) as an umbrella over
   this mechanism-specific MIB.  That is, DIFFSERV-POLICY-MIB provides a
   conceptual API for configuration of DiffServ parameters in a device
   at a higher level than the DiffServ Architecture MIB [DIFFSERVMIB].

4.  Definitions


   Terminology used in discussing policy-based configuration management
   has been the source of much discussion and confusion.  [SNMPBCP]
   provides a discussion of the terms used in discussing this topic.


5.  What this MIB Module Provides


   To be written:  to provide a high-level description of what this MIB
   does.


6.  Relationship to other MIBs


   In this section we describe the relationship of this MIB module to
   other MIB modules.  The overall architecture used for policy
   configuration management is described in [POLICYMIB].


6.1.  The Policy-based Management MIB module


   [POLICYMIB] defines a MIB module that enables policy-based
   configuration management of infrastructure using the Internet
   Standard Management Framework.  The document includes a table for
   configuring policies to be implemented, tables for storing the roles
   of elements on a particular device, a table for representing the
   capabilities of a device with respect to policy management, a table
   for referencing elements affected by a policy, and a table which
   points to into the mechanism-specific MIB (this memo).  This last
   table of pointers enables management applications to determine the
   mechanism-specific configuration to which a particular policy
   applies.  The primary purpose of this is to enable the manager to
   correct errors in installed policies.

   The pmPolicyMechanismTable (as the table in [POLICYMIB] is
   tentatively called), points into mechanism-specific MIBs and includes
   a RowPointer object pointing into a row in the diffPolicyPHBTable
   defined below.

   See [POLICYMIB] for a full description of the policy-based

Internet Draft             DiffServ Policy MIB             November 2000






   configuration framework it provides.


6.2.  The DiffServ MIB module


   The DiffServ Architecture MIB module [DIFFSERVMIB] provides a common
   set of managed objects useful for configuring DiffServ parameters on
   a particular device.  This is what is referred to as instance-level
   configuration. It is the alteration of the instance-level information
   in that MIB module which MAY be done via the objects provided by the
   DiffServ Policy MIB module defined in this memo.

   It is recognized that vendors may include additional managed objects
   in their devices (via vendor-specific MIB modules) for configuring
   DiffServ parameters. If a vendor chooses to use the objects defined
   in this memo for configuration, the vendor should provide additional
   managed objects in a similar approach as defined for the DiffServ
   Architecture MIB module.

   Since the managed objects of the DiffServ Architecture MIB are not
   directly associated with an instance (interface and interface
   direction), the same managed objects can be used for traffic
   treatment configuration templates in a DiffServ capable device.
   Therefore, the tables as defined in the DiffServ Architecture MIB can
   directly be used for configuration purposes.  Those tables are:
      diffServClfrTable,
      diffServClfrElementTable,
      diffServSixTupleClfrTable,
      diffServMeterTable,
      diffServTBMeterTable,
      diffServActionTable,
      diffServDscpMarkActTable,
      diffServCountActTable,
      diffServAlgDropTable,
      diffServRandomDropTable,
      diffServQTable,
      diffServSchedulerTable,
      diffServSchdParamTable.

   Readers familiar with the DiffServ Architecture MIB will notice that
   these are all templates except the diffServDataPathTable, which
   instantiates a DiffServ traffic treatment configuration on an
   interface and its interface direction.

Internet Draft             DiffServ Policy MIB             November 2000






   The approach taken in this document is to avoid duplication of
   managed objects and, therefore, the implementation of the DIFF-
   POLICY-MIB module should use of the tables defined in the DiffServ
   Architecture MIB.


6.3.  The DiffServ Policy MIB module design

   The DiffServ Policy MIB module of the SNMP-based configuration
   management framework is positioned between the Policy-based
   Management MIB module and the instance-specific MIB module (the
   DiffServ Architecture MIB module) as described above.

   The Differentiated Services Policy MIB (DIFFSERV-POLICY-MIB) module
   found in this memo is designed to have configuration templates for
   the Differentiated Services MIB (DIFFSERV-MIB) module. These
   templates represent a specific configuration of traffic treatment in
   a datapath of a Differentiated Services capable device. As soon as a
   configuration is made active via the POLICY-MANAGEMENT-MIB, the
   configuration defined within this MIB module will be instantiated on
   the instance-specific MIB (the DIFFSERV-MIB).

   Note that this is a conceptual process. That is, the configuration
   may not actually go through an API available in the subsystem which
   implements the DIFFSERV-MIB module.  However, configuration via the
   DIFFSERV-POLICY-MIB module will alter the same instrumentation as the
   DIFF-SERV-MIB module whether it does it via the DIFFSERV-MIB module
   or not.

   The Differentiated Services Policy MIB module only needs to define a
   starting point of a traffic treatment configuration template. This
   table is similar to the diffServDataPathTable [DIFFSERV-MIB].
   However, its has a semantic difference in that the
   diffServDataPathTable is associated with an instance (interface and
   interface direction) where the diffPolicyDPCTable is not instance-
   specific.

   Unlike most MIB modules, changes on the managed objects in this MIB
   module do not cause a change in the device.  This MIB module is used
   to set up per-hop-behavior configurations. As soon as configurations
   are made active via the POLICY-MANAGEMENT-MIB, the configurations
   defined within this MIB module will be instantiated on the instance
   specific MIB, the DIFF-SERV-MIB.

   The table in the MIB module is:





SNMPCONF WG                 Expires May 2001                    [Page 6]

Internet Draft             DiffServ Policy MIB             November 2000






    - The diffPolicyDPCTable provides managed objects for
      registering traffic treatment configurations used in
      differentiated services. The sole purpose of this table
      is to provide the starting point for a traffic treatment
      configuration template.  The traffic treatment is performed
      by datapath elements [DIFFSERVMIB]


7.  Template cloning

   The concept of the DIFF-POLICY-MIB is based on having traffic
   treatment configuration templates. The templates provide a set of
   configuration values that provide a certain behavior, such as EF
   traffic treatment in the datapath. The template can be considered as
   a linked list from a starting point and each element is connected to
   the next element via a, so-called,

   The moment a template is activated on an interface and its interface
   direction (instantiated), the template needs to be copied/cloned, so
   that the template remains as a template.  If the template does not
   stay as a template after an instantiation, the management station has
   to setup a new equivalent template, and the object amplification of
   configuration with SNMP is gone.

   A literal copy/clone of the template would not be possible, since the
   same indexes inside the element tables cannot be used again. The
   instantiation process must therefore generate a new index for each
   element. As a result of this, the 'NEXT' pointers also need to be
   updated. Otherwise, those will point to the template.

   What should a system containing DiffServ capabilities and DiffServ
   Policy capabilities do conceptually at the moment a template is
   activated on an interface?   The following order or approach is not a
   pre-defined implementation, but a conceptual explanation of what
   should be done.

     1) Get index of the template to be activated
     2) Get RowPointer (current) from
               diffPolicyDPCConfiguration.index of
               diffPolicyDPCTable
     3) Check if RowPointer (current) exists
     4) Copy/Clone the entry pointed to by RowPointer
        a) Get a new index for the entry
           b) Configure the new entry with the values
              of the entry to be cloned

Internet Draft             DiffServ Policy MIB             November 2000






           c) Update the NEXT pointer with a new RowPointer
              that pointed to the previous entry that was copied
              part of this template
     5) Store RowPointer of cloned entry as previous
     6) Get the RowPointer of the next element in in the template
        as current
     7) If current RowPointer does not equal zeroDotZero goto 4
