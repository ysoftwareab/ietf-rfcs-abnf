1.  Introduction

   The RDAP protocol described in RFCs 7480-7484 supports nameserver
   object lookup based on the name of the nameserver (see section 3.1.4
   of [RFC7482]), therefore it may not be possible to retrieve the
   registration information of a particular nameserver object sharing
   the name with other nameserver objects.

   This document describes a Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)
   extension that may be used to retrieve the registration information
   of a particular nameserver object sharing the name with other
   nameserver objects.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  RDAP Conformance object

   A server that conforms to this specification MUST include the string
   literal "rdap_nameservers_sharing_name" in the "rdapConformance"
   member of the topmost JSON object of all responses provided by the
   server.

   An example of a rdapConformance data structure including this
   extension:

     "rdapConformance" :
     [
      "rdap_level_0",
      "rdap_nameservers_sharing_name"
     ]


4.  Signaling the existence of nameservers sharing the same name

   A server that conforms to this specification MUST include a "links"
   member in a nameserver object, if a different nameserver object in
   the central repository shares the same name.

   The "links" array MUST include a "rel" of "collection", "type" of
   "application/rdap+json", and a "href" pointing to a nameserver search
   method by nameserver name.

   The following is an example of a nameserver object that includes a
   links member in order to signal the existence of other nameserver
   objects sharing the same name.

    }
   ]
  }


5.  Nameserver search by nameserver name

   An RDAP service that conforms to this specification MUST support
   nameserver search by nameserver name as described in section 3.2.2.
   of [RFC7482].

   The following is an elided example of a response to a
   /nameservers?name search for a nameserver sharing the name with
   another nameserver object in the central repository.

6.  Nameserver-by-handle path segment specification

   A server that conforms to this specification MUST support lookup
   queries of nameserver objects by the handle of the nameserver using
   the custom path "handle_nameserver".  The custom path
   "handle_nameserver" adhere to the extensibility mechanism described
   in Section 5 of [RFC7482].

   The appropriated structure for a response to a "handle_nameserver"
   lookup query is the same as the structure used for a response to a
   nameserver lookup query defined in section 3.1.4 of [RFC7482].

   Syntax: handle_nameserver/<handle>

   The <handle> parameter represents a nameserver identifier whose
   syntax is specific to the registration provider.

   The following URL would be used to find information for the
   nameserver associated with handle ROID123:

   https://example.com/rdap/handle_nameserver/ROID123

7.  Acknowledgements

   TBD.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The following values have been registered in the IANA RDAP Extensions
   registry:

   Extension identifier:  rdap_nameservers_sharing_name
   Registry operator:  N/A
   Specification:  draft-lozano-rdap-nameservers-sharing-name
   Contact:  See Author's Address section in the specification
   Intended Usage:  This document describes a Registration Data Access
      Protocol (RDAP) extension that may be used to retrieve the
      registration information of a particular nameserver object sharing
      the name with other nameserver objects.

9.  Security Considerations

   The RDAP extension described in this document do not provide any
   security services beyond those described by RDAP (see RFCs
   7480-7484), and protocol layers used by RDAP.  The security
   considerations described in these other specifications apply to this
   specification as well.
