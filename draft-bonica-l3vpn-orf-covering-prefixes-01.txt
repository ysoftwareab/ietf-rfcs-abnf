1.  Problem Statement

   A BGP [RFC4271] speaker can send Outbound Route Filters (ORF)
   [RFC5291] to a peer.  The peer uses ORFs to filter routing updates
   that it sends to the BGP speaker.  Using ORF, a speaker can realize a
   "route pull" paradigm in BGP, in which the speaker, on demand, pulls
   certain routes from the peer.

   This document defines a new ORF-type, called the "Covering Prefixes
   ORF (CP-ORF)".  CP-ORF is applicable in Virtual Hub-and-Spoke VPNs
   [RFC7024] [RFC4364].  It also is applicable BGP/MPLS Ethernet VPN
   (EVPN) [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn] Networks.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

   o  Address Family Indicator (AFI) - defined in [RFC4760]

Internet-Draft            ORF Shortest Conveing            February 2014


   o  Subsequent Address Family Indicator (SAFI) - defined in [RFC4760]

   o  VPN IP Default Route - defined in [RFC7024].

   o  V-Hub - defined in [RFC7024].

   o  V-Spoke - defined in [RFC7024].

   o  BGP/MPLS Ethernet VPN (EVPN) - defined in [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn]

   o  EVPN Instance (EVI) - defined in [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn]

   o  Default MAC Route (DMR) - An EVPN Route with MAC Address length
      equal to 0.  See Section 10.2.1 of [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn] for
      details.

   o  Default Gateway (DMG) - An EVPN PE that advertises a DMR

2.  CP-ORF Encoding

   [RFC5291] augments the BGP ROUTE-REFRESH message so that it can carry
   ORF entries.  When the ROUTE-REFRESH message carries ORF entries, it
   includes the following fields:

   o  AFI [IANA.AFI]

   o  SAFI [IANA.SAFI]

   o  When-to-refresh (IMMEDIATE or DEFERRED)

   o  ORF Type

   o  Length (of ORF entries)

   The ROUTE-REFRESH message also contains a list of ORF entries.  Each
   ORF entry contains the following fields:

   o  Action (ADD, REMOVE, or REMOVE-ALL)

   o  Match (PERMIT or DENY)

   The ORF entry may also contain Type-specific information.  Type-
   specific information is present only when the Action is equal to ADD
   or REMOVE.  It is not present when the Action is equal to REMOVE-ALL.

   When the BGP ROUTE-REFRESH message carries CP-ORF entries, the
   following conditions MUST be true:

Internet-Draft            ORF Shortest Conveing            February 2014


   o  ORF Type MUST be equal to CP-ORF.  (The value of CP-ORF is TBD.
      See Section 7 for details.)

   o  The AFI MUST be equal to IPv4, IPv6 or L2VPN

   o  If the AFI is equal to IPv4 or IPv6, SAFI MUST be equal to MPLS-
      labeled VPN address

   o  If the AFI is equal to L2VPN, the SAFI MUST be equal to BGP EVPN

   o  Match field MUST be equal to PERMIT

   Figure 1 depicts the encoding of the CP-ORF type-specific
   information.

                  Figure 1: CP-ORF Type-specific Encoding

   The Sequence field specifies the relative ordering of the entry among
   all CP-ORF entries.

   The CP-ORF recipient uses the following fields to identify routes
   that match the CP-ORF:

   o  Minlen

   o  Maxlen

   o  VPN Route Target

   o  Host Address

   See Section 3 for details.

Internet-Draft            ORF Shortest Conveing            February 2014


   The CP-ORF recipient marks routes that match CP-ORF with the Import
   Route Target before advertising those routes to the CP-ORF
   originator.  See Section 3 for details.

   If the ROUTE-REFRESH AFI is equal to IPv4, the length of the Host
   Address field is 32 bits.  If the ROUTE-REFRESH AFI is equal to IPv6,
   the length of the Host Address field is 128 bits.  If the ROUTE-
   REFRESH AFI is equal to L2VPN, the length of the Host Address field
   is 48 bits.

   If the ROUTE-REFRESH AFI value is equal to IPv4 or IPv6, the
   following rules apply:

   o  The value of Minlen MUST be less than or equal to the length of
      the Host Address field

   o  The value of Maxlen MUST be less than or equal to the length of
      the Host Address field

   o  The value of Minlen MUST be less than or equal to the value of
      Maxlen

   If the ROUTE-REFRESH AFI is equal to L2VPN, the following rules
   apply:

   o  The value of Minlen MUST be 48

   o  The value of Maxlen MUST be 48

3.  Processing Rules

   According to [RFC4271], every BGP speaker maintains a single Loc-RIB.
   For each of its peers, the BGP speaker also maintains an Outbound
   Filter and an Adj-RIB-Out. The Outbound Filter defines policy that
   determines which Loc-RIB entries are processed into the corresponding
   Adj-RIB-Out. Mechanisms such as RT-Contstrain [RFC4684] and ORF
   [RFC5291] enable a router's peer to influence the Outbound Filter.
   Therefore, the Outbound Filter for a given peer is constructed using
   a combination of the locally configured policy and the information
   received via RT-Constrain and ORF from the peer.

   Using this model we can describe the operations of CP-ORF as follows:

   When a BGP speaker receives a ROUTE-REFRESH message that contains a
   CP-ORF, and that ROUTE-REFRESH message that violates any of the
   encoding rules specified in Section 2, the BGP speaker MUST log the
   event and ignore the entire ROUTE-REFRESH message.

Internet-Draft            ORF Shortest Conveing            February 2014


   Otherwise, the BGP speaker processes each CP-ORF entry as indicated
   by the Action field.  If the Action is equal to ADD, the BGP speaker
   adds the CP-ORF entry to the Outbound Filter associated with the peer
   in the position specified by the Sequence field.  If the Action is
   equal to REMOVE, the BGP speaker removes the CP-ORF entry from the
   Outbound Filter.  If the Action is equal to REMOVE-ALL, the BGP
   speaker removes all CP-ORF entries from the Outbound Filter.

   Whenever the BGP speaker applies an Outbound Filter to a route
   contained by its Loc-RIB, it evaluates the route in terms of the CP-
   ORF entries first.  It then evaluates the route in terms of the
   remaining, non-CP-ORF entries.  The rules for the former are
   described below.  The rules for the latter are outside the scope of
   this document.

   The following route types can match a CP-ORF:

   o  IPv4-VPN

   o  IPv6-VPN

   o  L2VPN (L2VPN MAC Advertisement only.  See Section 8.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn] for details.)

   In order for an IPv4-VPN route or IPv6-VPN route to match a CP-ORF,
   all of the following conditions MUST be true:

   o  the route carries an RT whose value is the same as the CP-ORF VPN
      Route Target

   o  the route prefix length is greater than or equal to the CP-ORF
      Minlen plus 64 (i.e., the length of a VPN Route Distinguisher)

   o  the route prefix length is less than or equal to the CP-ORF Maxlen
      plus 64 (i.e., the length of a VPN Route Distinguisher)

   o  ignoring the Route Distinguisher, the leading bits of the route
      prefix are identical to the leading bits of the CP-ORF Host
      Address.  CP-ORF Minlen defines the number of bis that must be
      identical.

   The BGP speaker ignores Route Distinguishers when determining whether
   a prefix covers a host address.  For example, assume that a CP-ORF
   carries the following information:

   o  Minlen equal to 1

   o  Maxlen equal to 32

Internet-Draft            ORF Shortest Conveing            February 2014


   o  Host Address equal to 192.0.2.1

   Assume also that Loc-RIB contains routes for the following IPv4-VPN
   prefixes, and that all of these routes carry an RT whose value is the
   same as the CP-ORF VPN Route Target:

   o  1:0.0.0.0/64.

   o  2:192.0.2.0/88

   o  3:192.0.2.0/89

   For the purposes of this evaluation, 2:192.0.2.0/88 and 3:192.0.2.0/
   89 cover 192.0.2.1.  This is because the search algorithm ignores
   Route Distinguishers.  However, 1:0.0.0.0/64 does not cover
   192.0.2.1, because its length (64) is less than the CP-ORF Minlen (1)
   plus the length of an L3VPN Route Distinguisher (64).

   In order for an EVPN route match a CP-ORF, all of the following
   conditions MUST be true:

   o  the route carries an RT whose value is the same as the CP-ORF VPN
      Route Target

   o  the final 48 bits of the EVPN MAC Address are identical to the CP-
      ORF Host Address

   If a route matches the selection criteria of a CP-ORF entry, and it
   does not violate any subsequent rule specified by the Outbound Filter
   (e.g., rules that reflect local policy, or rules that are due to RT-
   Constrains), the BGP speaker places the route into the Adj-RIB-Out.
   In Adj-RIB-Out, the BGP speaker adds the CP-ORF Import Route Target
   to the list of Route Targets that the route already carries.  As a
   result of being placed in Adj-RIB-Out, the route is advertised to the
   peer associated with the Adj-RIB-Out.

   Receiving CP-ORF entries with REMOVE or REMOVE-ALL Actions may cause
   a route that has previously been installed in a particular Adj-RIB-
   Out be excluded from that Adj-RIB-Out. In this case, as specified in
   [RFC4271], "the previously advertised route in that Adj-RIB-Out MUST
   be withdrawn from service by means of an UPDATE message".

   [RFC5291] states that a BGP speaker should respond to a ROUTE REFRESH
   message as follows:

   "If the When-to-refresh indicates IMMEDIATE, then after processing
   all the ORF entries carried in the message the speaker re-advertises
   to the peer routes from the Adj-RIB-Out associated with the peer that

   have the same AFI/SAFI as what is carried in the message, and taking
   into account all the ORF entries for that AFI/SAFI received from the
   peer.  The speaker MUST re-advertise all the routes that have been
   affected by the ORF entries carried in the message, but MAY also re-
   advertise the routes that have not been affected by the ORF entries
   carried in the message."

   When the ROUTE-REFRESH message includes one or more CP-ORF entries,
   the BGP speaker MUST re-advertise routes that have been affected by
   ORF entries carried by the message.  While the speaker MAY also re-
   advertise the routes that have not been affected by the ORF entries
   carried in the message, this memo RECOMMENDS not to re-advertise the
   routes that have not been affected.

4.  Applicability In Virtual Hub-and-Spoke VPNs

   In a Virtual Hub-and-Spoke environment, VPN sites are attached to
   Provider Edge (PE) routers, where for a given VPN some of these PEs
   may act as V-hubs, while others as V-spokes.  This memo assumes that
   PEs exchange VPN-IP routes using Route Reflectors (RRs).

   This memo also assumes that RED-VPN sites are attached to PE routers,
   V-hub1 and V-spoke1.  All of these devices advertise RED-VPN routes
   to a RR.  They mark these routes with a route target, which we will
   call RT-RED.

   V-hub1 serves the RED-VPN.  Therefore, V-hub1 advertises a VPN IP
   default route for the RED-VPN to the RR, carrying the route target
   RT-RED-FROM-HUB1.

   V-spoke1 establishes a BGP session with the RR, negotiating the CP-
   ORF capability, as well as the Multiprotocol Extensions Capability
   [RFC2858].  Upon establishment of the BGP session, the RR does not
   advertise any routes to V-spoke1.  The RR will not advertise any
   routes until it receives either a ROUTE-REFRESH message or a BGP
   UPDATE message containing a Route Target Membership NLRI [RFC4684].

   Immediately after the BGP session is established, V-spoke1 sends the
   RR a BGP UPDATE message containing a Route Target Membership NLRI.
   The Route Target Membership NLRI specifies RT-RED-FROM-HUB1 as its
   route target.  In response to the BGP-UPDATE message, the RR
   advertises the VPN IP default route for the RED-VPN to V-spoke1.
   This route carries the route target RT-RED-FROM-HUB1.  V-spoke1
   subjects this route to its import policy and accepts it because it
   carries the route target RT-RED-FROM-HUB1.

   Now, V-spoke1 begins normal operation, sending all of its RED-VPN
   traffic through V-hub1.  At some point, V-spoke1 determines that it

Internet-Draft            ORF Shortest Conveing            February 2014


   might benefit from a more direct route to a destination.  (Criteria
   by which V-spoke1 determines that it needs a more direct route are
   beyond the scope of this document.)

   In order to discover a more direct route, V-spoke1 assigns a unique
   numeric identifier to the destination.  V-spoke1 then sends a ROUTE-
   REFRESH message to the RR, containing the following information:

   o  AFI is equal to IPv4 or IPv6, as appropriate

   o  SAFI is equal to "MPLS-labeled VPN address"

   o  When-to-refresh is equal IMMEDIATE

   o  Action is equal to ADD

   o  Match is equal to PERMIT

   o  ORF Type is equal to CP-ORF

   o  CP-ORF Sequence is equal to the identifier associated with the
      destination

   o  CP-ORF Minlen is equal to 1

   o  CP-ORF Maxlen is equal to 32 or 128, as appropriate

   o  CP-ORF VPN Route Target is equal to RT-RED

   o  CP-ORF Host Address is equal the destination address

   o  CP-ORF Import Route Target is equal to RT-RED-FROM-HUB1

   Upon receipt of the ROUTE-REFRESH message, the RR must ensure that it
   carries all routes belonging to the RED-VPN.  In at least one special
   case, where all of the RR clients are V-spokes and none of the RR
   clients are V-hubs, the RR will lack some or all of the required RED-
   VPN routes.  So, the RR sends a BGP UPDATE message containing a Route
   Target Membership NLRI for VPN-RED to all of its peers.  This causes
   the peers to advertise VPN-RED routes to the RR, if they have not
   done so already.

   Next, the RR adds the received CP-ORF to the Outbound Filter
   associated with V-spoke1.  Using the procedures in Section 3, the RR
   determines whether any of the routes in its Loc-RIB satisfy the
   selection criteria of the newly updated Outbound Filter.  If any
   routes satisfy the match criteria, they are added to the Adj-RIB-Out
   associated with V-spoke1.  In Adj-RIB-Out, the RR adds RT-RED-FROM-

Internet-Draft            ORF Shortest Conveing            February 2014


   HUB1 to the list of Route Targets that the route already carries.
   Finally, RR advertises the newly added routes to V-spoke1.  The
   advertised routes may specify either V-hub1 or any other node as the
   NEXT-HOP.

   V-spoke1 subjects the advertised routes to its import policy and
   accepts them because they carry the route target RT-RED-FROM-HUB1.

   V-spoke1 may repeat this process whenever it discovers another flow
   that might benefit from a more direct route to its destination.

5.  Applicability In Network Virtualization Overlays

   In an EVPN environment, Layer 2 networks are connected to Provider
   Edge (PE) devices.  PE devices can be real or virtualized.  Within a
   given EVPN, one or more EVPN Instances (EVI) can serve as a Default
   MAC Gateway (DMG).  Each DMG advertises a Default MAC Route (DMR) to
   the rest of the EVIs in the EVPN.  EVIs use the DMR to forward
   traffic destined to MAC addresses for which they do not have a
   corresponding MAC Advertisement Route.

   For the purposes of example, assume the following:

   o  Layer 2 Networks belonging to the RED-VPN are attached to PEs that
      support EVPN.

   o  At any given point in time, an end-system that belongs to the RED-
      VPN communicates with only a small subset of other end-systems
      that belong to the RED-VPN.  Therefore, at any given point in
      time, most of the PEs that serve the RED-VPN use only a small
      subset of the MAC Advertisement Routes in the RED-VPN.

   o  One PE device serves as a DMG for the RED-VPN.  We will call this
      device DMG 1.  The RED-VPN EVI on DMG 1 is provisioned with RT-
      RED-FROM-HUB1 as its export RT, and RT-RED as its import RT.

   o  Another PE device that hosts an EVI of the RED-VPN can not
      accommodate all RED-VPN MAC Advertisement routes.  We will call
      this device Spoke 1.  This EVI is provisioned with RT-RED as its
      export RT, and RT-RED-FROM-HUB1 as its import RT.

   o  All PE devices that have EVIs of the RED-VPN advertise various
      EVPN routes, including MAC Advertisement Routes to one or more
      RRs.

   DMG 1 serves the RED-VPN.  Therefore, DMG 1 advertises a DMR for the
   RED-VPN to the RR, carrying the route target RT-RED-FROM-HUB1.

   Spoke 1 establishes a BGP session with the RR, negotiating the CP-ORF
   capability, as well as the Multiprotocol Extensions Capability
   [RFC2858].  Upon establishment of the BGP session, the RR does not
   advertise any routes to Spoke 1.  The RR will not advertise any
   routes until it receives either a ROUTE-REFRESH message or a BGP
   UPDATE message containing a Route Target Membership NLRI [RFC4684].

   Immediately after the BGP session is established, Spoke 1 sends the
   RR a BGP UPDATE message containing a Route Target Membership NLRI.
   The Route Target Membership NLRI specifies RT-RED-FROM-HUB1 as its
   route target.  In response to the BGP-UPDATE message, the RR
   advertises the DMR for the RED-VPN to Spoke 1.  This route carries
   the route target RT-RED-FROM-HUB1.  Spoke 1 subjects this route to
   its import policy and accepts it because it carries the route target
   RT-RED-FROM-HUB1.

   Now, Spoke 1 begins normal operation, sending all of its RED-VPN
   traffic through DMG 1.  At some point, Spoke 1 determines that it
   might benefit from a more direct route to a destination.  (Criteria
   by which V-spoke1 determines that it needs a more direct route are
   beyond the scope of this document.)

   In order to discover a more direct route, Spoke 1 assigns a unique
   numeric identifier to the destination.  Spoke 1 then sends a ROUTE-
   REFRESH message to the RR, containing the following information:

   o  AFI is equal to L2VPN

   o  SAFI is equal to BGP EVPN

   o  When-to-refresh is equal IMMEDIATE

   o  Action is equal to ADD

   o  Match is equal to PERMIT

   o  ORF Type is equal to CP-ORF

   o  CP-ORF Sequence is equal to the identifier associated with the
      destination

   o  CP-ORF Minlen is equal to 48

   o  CP-ORF Maxlen is equal to 48

   o  CP-ORF VPN Route Target is equal to RT-RED

   o  CP-ORF Host Address is equal the destination address

   o  CP-ORF Import Route Target is equal to RT-RED-FROM-HUB1

   Next, the RR adds the received CP-ORF to the Outbound Filter
   associated with Spoke 1.  Using the procedures in Section 3, the RR
   determines whether any of the MAC Advertisement routes in its Loc-RIB
   satisfy the selection criteria of the newly updated Outbound Filter.
   If any of these routes satisfy the match criteria, they are added to
   the Adj-RIB-Out associated with Spoke 1.  In Adj-RIB-Out, the RR adds
   RT-RED-FROM-HUB1 to the list of Route Targets that the route already
   carries.  Finally, RR advertises the newly added routes to Spoke 1.
   The advertised routes carry as their NEXT-HOP the address of the PE
   device from which the routes have been originated.

   Spoke 1 subjects the the MAC Advertisement Routes received from RR to
   its import policy and accepts them because they carry the route
   target RT-RED-FROM-HUB1.

   Spoke 1 may repeat this process whenever it discovers another flow
   that might benefit from a more direct route to its destination.

6.  Clean-up

   Each CP-ORF consumes memory and compute resources on the device that
   supports it.  Therefore, in order to obtain optimal performance, BGP
   speakers periodically evaluate all CP-ORFs that they have originated
   and remove unneeded CP-ORFs.  The criteria by which a BGP speaker
   identifies unneeded CP-ORF entries is a matter of local policy, and
   is beyond the scope of this document.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a All Covering Prefixes ORF Type from the
   BGP Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) Types Registry.

8.  Security Considerations

   Each CP-ORF consumes memory and compute resources on the device that
   supports it.  Therefore, a device supporting CP-ORF take the
   following steps to protect itself from oversubscription:

   o  When negotiating the ORF capability, advertise willingness to
      receive the CP-ORF only to known, trusted iBGP peers

   o  Enforce a per-peer limit on the number of CP-ORFs that can be
      installed at any given time.  Ignore all requests to add CP-ORFs
      beyond that limit
