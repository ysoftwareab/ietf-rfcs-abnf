                   PASSporT SHAKEN Extension (SHAKEN)
                  draft-wendt-stir-passport-shaken-00

Abstract

   This document extends PASSporT, a token object that conveys
   cryptographically-signed information about the participants involved
   in personal communications, to include information defined as part of
   the SHAKEN [ATIS-1000074] specification for indicating an attestation
   level and originating ID.

1.  Introduction

   The SHAKEN specification defines a framework for using STIR protocols
   including PASSporT and the STIR certificate framework for
   implementing the cryptographic validation of an authorized originator
   of telephone calls using SIP.  Because the current telephone network
   contains both VoIP and TDM/SS7 originated traffic, there is many
   scenarios that need to be accounted for where PASSporT signatures may
   represent either direct or indirect call origination scenarios.  The
   SHAKEN [ATIS-1000074] specification defines levels of attribution of
   the origination of the call as well as an origination identifier that
   can help create a unique association with the origination of calls
   from various parts of the VoIP or TDM telephone network.  This
   document specifies these indicators as a specified PASSporT
   extension.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  PASSporT 'attest' Claim

   This indicator allows for both identifying the service provider that
   is vouching for the call as well as a clearly indicating what
   information the service provider is attesting to.  The 'attest' claim



Wendt & Barnes           Expires January 4, 2018                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft                    idreg                        July 2017


   can be one of the following three values, 'A', 'B', or 'C' as defined
   in [ATIS-1000074].

4.  PASSporT 'origid' Claim

   The purpose of the unique origination identifier is to assign an
   opaque identifier corresponding to the service provider-initiated
   calls themselves, customers, classes of devices, or other groupings
   that a service provider might want to use for determining things like
   reputation or trace back identification of customers or gateways.
   The value of 'origid' claim is a UUID as defined in [RFC4122].

5.  Example

   Protected Header
   {
      "alg":"ES256",
      "typ":"passport",
      "ppt":"shaken",
      "x5u":"https://cert.example.org/passport.crt"
   }
   Payload
   {
      "attest":"A"
      "dest":{"uri":"sip:alice@example.com"}
      "iat":"1443208345",
      "orig":{"tn":"12155551212"},
      "origid":"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000"
   }

6.  Using 'shaken' in SIP

   The use of the 'shaken' PASSporT type and the claims 'attest' and
   'origid' are formally defined in [ATIS-1000074] for usage in SIP
   [RFC3261] aligned with the use of the identity header defined in
   [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis].  The carriage of the 'attest' and
   'origid' values are in the full PASSporT token included in the
   identity header as specified in [ATIS-1000074].

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  JSON Web Token claims

   This specification requests that the IANA add two new claims to the
   JSON Web Token Claims registry as defined in [RFC7519].

   Claim Name: "attest"
