Abstract

   This specification defines an extension for mobility session
   redirection in Proxy Mobile IPv6 networks, enabling the sessions to
   be redirected between local mobility anchors over a PMIPv6 domain.

1. Introduction

   RFC 6463 describes the runtime local mobility anchor assignment
   functionality and corresponding mobility options for Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 (PMIPv6). However, it is valid only for initial registration
   process not in the middle of the session.

   Checking load condition on initially designated LMA and redirecting
   a requested session to other LMAs can be used for load balancing.
   However, load condition is dynamically changed and varied by
   incoming and handover sessions. For better load balancing effect,
   this draft specifies mobility session redirection over PMIPv6
   networks.



2. Overview

   The mobility session redirection, in short MSR, relies on the
   runtime LMA assignment scheme defined in [RFC6463].

       Figure 1 An example of mobility session redirection procedure



   Figure 1 shows the message sequence procedure for proposed mobility
   session redirection scheme. Suppose that each LMA has a load
   threshold it can endure. When load reaches the threshold of
   acceptable capacity of LMA1, LMA redirection is then activated for a
   selected mobile node (MN). Alternatively, when the load reaches the
   absolute maximum capacity allowed in LMA1, LMA1 does not wait for
   the next refresh binding request of Proxy Binding Update (PBU)
   message, but proactively sends a load balancing (LB) warning message
   to the designated MAG to force a refresh binding request. For the
   warning message, the update notification mechanism, defined in
   [RFC7077], as to induce the binding refresh request can be utilized.

   LMA1 proceeds to pass the binding update to LMA2, and handles the
   corresponding acknowledgment. Once a chosen MN gets successfully
   registered at LMA2, LMA2 takes the anchoring role for the MN so that

   data traffic between the MN and CNs is anchored at LMA2. For the
   packet interception at LMA2, there may be various methods depending
   on the deployed policies of the operators; one could to use IPv6
   anycast address to intercept the packets destined to the prefix the
   MN has, based on the shared prefix configuration of LMAs. The other
   could extend LMA to act as a proxy neighbor to the neighbor
   discovery request for the packets destined to the prefix the MN has.



3. Required functions and considerations

3.1. Load monitoring

   LMAs need to collect and manage load information of all MNs in its
   binding cache through utilizing Load Information Mobility option
   [RFC6463] or relying on other management systems.



3.2. Target MN selection

   The proposed scheme may potentially lead to service disruption on
   the MN when it occurs simultaneously with inter-MAG handoff. To
   minimize this occurrence, a careful target MN selection is required.
   However, this issue is out of scope in this specification.



4. Security Considerations
