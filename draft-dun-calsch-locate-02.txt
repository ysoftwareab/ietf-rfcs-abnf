       Abstract

         When scheduling an event, it is a prerequisite that an organizer has
         the calendar address of each attendee that will be invited to the
         event. Additionally, access to an attendee's current ''busy time''
         provides an a priori indication of whether the attendee will be free
         to participate in the event.

         In order to meet these challenges, a calendar user agent (CUA) needs
         a mechanism to locate (URL)  individual user's calendar and
         free/busy time.

         This draft defines three mechanisms for obtaining a URL to a user's
         calendar and free/busy time. These include:

         - Manual transfer of the information;
         - Personal data exchange using the vCard format; and
         - Directory lookup using the LDAP protocol.


      1.   URLs

         This draft defines four classes of URLs.  URLs are more useful if it
         is understood what the URLs point to.  Here is a brief description:



      Dun, Hennessy, Dawson                                         [Page 1]

      INTERNET-DRAFT    Calendar attributes for vCard/LDAP     February 1998


      1.1. Free/Busy URL (FBURL)

         The free/busy URL is defined to be a transport independent location
         where a client can obtain information about when a user is busy. At
         the present time, this URL only points to busy time data. Future
         revisions of this specification may provide for the extended
         capability of publishing free time data.

         If a calendaring and scheduling client (i.e., CUA) were to retrieve
         data from this location using FTP or HTTP, it would get back an
         iCalendar object [9] containing one or more "VFREEBUSY" calendar
         components.  If a MIME transport is being used, the response will be
         contained within a "text/calendar" MIME body part as specified in
         the iCalendar specification [9].  For example:

         BEGIN:VCALENDAR
         VERSION:2.0
         PRODID:-//hacksw/handcal//NONSGML v1.0//EN
         METHOD:PUBLISH
         BEGIN:VFREEBUSY
         ATTENDEEMAILTO:jane_doe@host1.com
         DTSTART:19971013T050000Z
         DTEND:19971124T050000Z
         DTSTAMP:19970901T083000Z
         FREEBUSY:19971015T133000Z/19971015T180000Z
         FREEBUSY:19971015T190000Z/19971015T220000Z
         END:VFREEBUSY
         END:VCALENDAR

         The amount of busy time data associated pointed to by the FBURL will
         generally be pre-determined; for example one monthof free/busy
         inforation.  As a guideline, it is recommended that the previous six
         weeks of busy time data be published at the location associated with
         the FBURL. If this URL points to a file resource, it is recommended
         that the file extension be "ifb" to distinguish it from an arbitrary
         iCalendar object.

      1.2  Calendar Address URL (CALADRURL)

         The calendar address URL is defined to be a transport independent
         communication end-point for a user.   The organizer's calendaring
         and scheduling client (ie. CUA) would use this URL to determine
         where to send an event request when organizing a meeting with a
         particular attendee.

         If the user prefers to receive event requests via iMIP, then the
         user would provide a "mailto" URL containing the user's e-mail
         address.  For example:

         "mailto:user@host1.com"

      INTERNET-DRAFT    Calendar attributes for vCard/LDAP     February 1998


         The URL for an iRIP user is yet to be defined, but that is another
         possible URL value in this property.


      1.3. Calendar Access URL (CAPURL)

         The Calendar Access URL is defined to be a protocol independent
         location from which a calendaring and scheduling client (i.e., CUA)
         can communicate with a user's entire calendar.

         The semantics for using this URL as an access protocol locator are
         yet to be defined by the IETF CALSCH Working Group. This will be
         addressed in the "Calendar Access Protocol" specification.

      1.4  Calendar URL (CALURL)h

         The Calendar URL is defined to be a protocol independent location
         from which a calendaring and scheduling client (ie. CUA) can
         retrieve an entire copy of a user's calendar.  Retrieving data from
         this URL obtains a published "snapshot" of the user's calendar.

         HTTP URL.  If the URL is an HTTP URL, then the content returned with
         a GET should be a "text/calendar" MIME body part containing one or
         more iCalendar object.

         FTP URL.  If the URL is an FTP URL, then the resource pointed to
         should be a file with an "ics" file extension containing one or more
         iCalendar objects.


      1.5. Default URLs

         There are many cases where a user may have more than one calendar.
         In these cases, a user may have multiple URLs, each URL pointing to
         a calendar or free/busy data.

         To make the case of multiple calendars simpler for clients, the
         concept of the "default" calendar is introduced.  A "default"
         calendar is one that the user has designated as the calendar that
         other users should look at when accessing the user's calendar, or
         retrieving the user's free/busy time.

         The default calendar may, in fact, include rolled-up information
         from all the user's other calendars.  The other calendars may only
         exist for organizational purposes.



      2.  Distribution

         These four URLs provide valuable pointers to calendaring and
         scheduling data that other users need in order to know when to


      Dun, Hennessy, Dawson                                         [Page 3]

      INTERNET-DRAFT    Calendar attributes for vCard/LDAP     February 1998


         schedule meetings, etc.  There are several possibilities on how
         users can communicate these URLs to other users.  The following
         section outlines how these URLs can be distributed to other users.


      2.1. Manual Transfer

         The simplest way to obtain these URLs is for a user to communicate
         the URLs using some out-of-band mechanism such as verbally, in an e-
         mail message, or by printing these URLs on a paper business card.

         When using this mechanism, the user obtains these URLs using an out-
         of-band mechanism and then enters these URLs into their calendaring
         software manually.


      2.2. Personal Data Exchange Using A vCard

         A more sophisticated way to obtain these URLs is for users to
         publish vCards containing these URLs. The vCard object can be
         transferred between one another.  Since many e-mail clients allow a
         user to automatically include a vCard with every message that the
         user sends, this provides a simple transparent way for a user to
         distribute their calendaring and scheduling URLs.

         On the receiving end, an e-mail client that provides an integrated
         vCard database can provide a way to lookup calendaring URLs for
         users whose vCards are stored locally.


      2.2.1. vCard Schema Extensions

         Since the vCard [8] specification doesn't specify how to encode
         calendaring URLs in a vCard, this section is provided as an
         extension to vCard which specifies how to encode calendaring URLs
         within a vCard.

         Inside a vCard object, four new properties are defined: "CALURL",
         'CAPURL', 'CALADRURL', and "FBURL", as defined above.

         Any vCard can have one or more of these properties, each
         representing a calendar or free/busy time that is associated with
         the user.

         One of these properties can be designated as the "default" by adding
         the "PREF" parameter.

         Here is a simple example of a vCard containing a "FBURL" and a
         "CALURL".

      2.3. Directory Lookup Using The LDAP v3 Protocol

         Another way to obtain these URLs is to look them up in a directory
         using the LDAP protocol.

         If an organizer knows an attendee's e-mail address, then using DNS,
         the attendee's directory server can be found.  The mechanism for
         this is described in detail in [7].  From the directory server, the


      Dun, Hennessy, Dawson                                         [Page 6]

      INTERNET-DRAFT    Calendar attributes for vCard/LDAP     February 1998


         client can look up the URLs for a user's calendar.  Here's a summar
         how it works, for more detail, please see the draft [7].

         The client first parses the domain name out from the rfc822 mailbox
         name.  For the fictitious mailbox "janedoe@host1.com", the domain
         name would be "host1.com".

         Given the domain name, the client prepends "ldap.tcp" to the domain
         name and formulating a host.  Next the client retrieves the queries
         the DNS server for the SRV record for "ldap.tcp.host1.com". The
         mechanism for adding "ldap.tcp" onto the original domain name is
         described in detail in [5].  The DNS server returns the IP address
         for the associated server for 'ldap.tcp.host1.com'.

         Once the IP address for the LDAP server has been obtained, the
         client constructs a DN from which to search using the DNS name.  In
         this case, it would be "DC=host1,DC=COM".  The mechanism to
         construct the DN is described in detail in [6].  With the IP address
         and the DN, the client issues a search request to the server where
         the attribute named "mail" [4] "equalityMatch"es the user's email
         address.  From the first matching entry, client obtains the
         calendaring and scheduling URLs.

         If a user's URLs can be found using directory lookup, they should,
         in general, be considered "more up-to-date" than URLs in any vCards
         that are stored locally.


      2.3.1. LDAP Schema Extensions

         In order to encode the calendaring URLs in the directory, the
         following are defined:

              one object class:

              @ calEntry

              and eight attributes:

              @ calCalURL
              @ calFBURL
              @ calCAPURL
              @ calCalAdrURL
              @ calOtherCalURLs
              @ calOtherFBURLs
              @ calOtherCAPURLs
              @ calOtherCalAdrURLs


         The calCalURL contains the URL to a snapshot of the user's entire
         default calendar.  The calFBURL contains the URL to the user's
         default busy time data.  The calCAPURL contains a URL that can be


      Dun, Hennessy, Dawson                                         [Page 7]

      INTERNET-DRAFT    Calendar attributes for vCard/LDAP     February 1998


         used to communicate with the user's calendar.  The calCalAdrURL
         contains a URL that points to the location to which event requests
         should be sent for that user.

         The calOtherCalURLs is a multi-valued property containing URLs to
         snapshots of other calendars that the user may have.  The
         calOtherFBURLs is a multi-valued property containing URLs to other
         free/busy data that the user may have.  The calOtherCAPURLs
         attribute is a multi-valued property containing URLs to other
         calendars that the user may have.  The calOtherCalAdrURLs attribute
         is a multi-valued property containing URLs to other locations that a
         user may want event requests sent to.

         There is no predetermined order to the values in either multi-valued
         property.
