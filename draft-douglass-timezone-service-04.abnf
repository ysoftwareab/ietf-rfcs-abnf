returnall="true".  The client should preserve the returned datastamp
lang=<lang-code>  OPTIONAL, but MAY occur multiple times.
         Specifies the language or languages for localized information.

tzid=<identifier>  OPTIONAL, and MAY occur once or more.  If
         specified identifies timezone(s) for which information is to be
         returned.  If this parameter is specified changedsince MUST NOT
         be specified.
         If tzid is specified the dtstamp element will be returned in
         the response.  This dtstamp is for the entire set of data and
         allows the client to determine if it should refresh its full
         set.

format=<media-type>  OPTIONAL, but MUST occur only once.  Return
         information using the specified media-type.  In the absence of
         this parameter, the value "text/calendar" MUST be assumed.

lang=<lang-code>  OPTIONAL, but MAY occur multiple times.  If
         present, specifies the language or languages for localized
         information.

tzid=<identifier>  REQUIRED, and MUST occur only once.  Identifies
         the timezone for which information is returned.  The server
         MUST return an Etag header.  Alternatively, if a value of "*"
         is given, returns information for all timezones.  The "*"
         option will typically be used by servers that wish to retrieve
         the entire set of timezones supported by another server to re-
         synchronize their entire data cache.  Clients will typically
         only retrieve individual timezone data on a case-by-case basis.

substitute-alias=<true|false>  OPTIONAL and defaults to false.  If
         true and the tzid is an alias it will replace the tzid in the
         returned specification.  If false, the returned specification
         will have the canonical identifier.

tzid=<identifier>  REQUIRED, but MUST only occur once.  Identifies
         the timezone for which information is returned.  The value "*",
         which has a special meaning in the "get" operation, is not
         supported by this operation.

lang=<lang-code>  OPTIONAL, but MAY occur multiple times.  If
         present, specifies the language or languages for localized
         information.
start=date or date-time:  OPTIONAL, but MUST occur only once.  If
         present, specifies the start of the period of interest.  If
         omitted, the current year is assumed.

end=date or date-time:  OPTIONAL, but MUST occur only once.  If
         present, specifies the end of the period of interest.  If
         omitted, the current year + 10 is assumed.

name=<text>  REQUIRED, but MUST only occur once.  Identifies the
         name to search for.  Only partial matching is supported.

lang=<lang-code>  OPTIONAL, but MAY occur multiple times.  If
         present, specifies the language or languages for localized
         information.
