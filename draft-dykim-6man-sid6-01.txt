                     Subnet ID Deprecation for IPv6
                        draft-dykim-6man-sid6-01

Abstract

   Deprecation of the subnet ID in IPv6 networking is proposed; the
   subnet ID is set to zero so that all nodes in a site carry the same
   prefix.  While the procedures for neighbor discovery and duplicate
   address detection have to be changed, possible simplification gains
   in IPv6 networking including that of intra-site host- and subnet-
   mobility might be worth the modification.  Site-external behaviors
   don't change through this modification, enabling incremental
   deployment of the proposal.  Sites of manageable sizes for which
   scalability is not much a critical issue might consider the mode of
   operation proposed in this document.

1.  Introduction

   The idea of IPv4 subnet has been imported intact into IPv6 networking
   so that each subnet (link) in an IPv6 site is assigned a separate
   subnet ID (SID).  As a result, the IPv6 host has to change the link
   prefix every time it moves from one link to another even within the
   same site or routing domain; you have to install MIPv6 agents [MIPv6]
   on every intra-site router and a MIP6 client on every mobile node in
   order to provide intra-site node mobility.  It might be challenged
   whether this legacy way of IPv6 operation should continue to be the
   best way in networking environments ever evolving to a form vastly
   different from that of the past.

   For one thing, scalability, one of the main reasons for subnetting,
   might bear different implications from the past.  Moor's Law has
   continued to be relevant for decades since the time IPv6 was first
   conceived, and cost or performance concerns for memories and
   processors have been dramatically relaxed.  There might be many
   potential network administrators who would consider to weigh the
   burden of managing SIDs and the associated MIPv6 infrastructure
   against that of inherent mobility support by link-state routing.

   This document proposes to change the operation of IPv6 networking by
   deprecating the SID.  That is, the value of SID shall be set to zero.
   This results in all intra-site nodes carrying the same prefix and the
   mobile nodes keeping the same address as long as the mobility is
   confined within a given site.

   A number of operational efficiency might result from this change.
   The price to pay might be some changes in the procedures for neighbor
   discovery (ND) and duplicate address detection (DAD).  This document
   presents how this new operational paradigm, to be abbreviated as
   SID6, could be constructed and discusses possible impacts from this
   change.

   It is to be noted that this document limits its SID6 discussions to
   the case of a site consisting of a single routing area; there are no
   Level 2 routers in the site under discussion.  The multi-area case is
   left for further study.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

   This document introduces the following terminology.

   DA: Duplicate Advertisement.  A unicast message, back to the source
   address of the previous DS message received, to report the duplicity
   of the target address in the DS message.

   DS: Duplicate Solicitation.  A site-wide multicast message to solicit
   the response from a node in possession of the same address as the
   target address in this message.

3.1.  IPv6 Address

   The IPv6 address type of interest is the Global Unicast address (GUA)
   which contains the SID and interface ID (IID) [v6ADDR]:

      IPv6 GUA

         = (interface address)

         = (subnet prefix, IID)

         = (global routing prefix, SID, IID)

   Now, we reset the SID, and the IPv6 GUA will no longer depend on the
   SID; it doesn't change as a node moves across subnets (links) within
   a site:

      IPv6 GUA

         = (interface address)

         = (subnet prefix, IID)

         = (global routing prefix, null, IID)

   Furthermore, we change the use of the IID as the node ID (NID).  That
   is, each node is associated with an NID unique within a site.  When a
   node has multiple interfaces, there would be multiple IIDs
   associated.  In that case, we enforce all IIDs to be the same, thus
   ensuring a unique NID per node.  The result is:

      IPv6 GUA

         = (node address)

         = (subnet prefix, NID)

         = (global routing prefix, null, NID)

   This unique NID is invariant within a site or routing domain.  The
   address is now a node address, not an interface address.

   When a site is multihomed on multiple upstream networks, it would be
   associated with multiple site prefixes and hence every intra-site
   node would be associated with multiple addresses.  For seamless site-
   multihoming in such an instance, a node should be able to receive
   inbound packets destined to any of its multiple addresses, and also




DY Kim                  Expires September 4, 2019               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                    SID6                        March 2019


   be able to source outbound packets with one of such multiple
   addresses as appropriate [DASv6].

   Remember all we do here is to reset the SID.  And that, it is not any
   change in the definition of the IPv6 address format, but is just an
   operational choice.  All other effects are natural corollaries
   thereof; the basic IPv6 mechanisms remain the same.  We will
   subsequently see how other parts of the IPv6 networking continue to
   work correctly as usual, with minimal modifications where necessary.

3.2.  Neighbor Discovery

   Addresses involved in ICMPv6-derived [ICMPv6] ND messages [NDv6] are
   either All-Nodes multicast addresses (FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:1) or All-
   Routers multicast addresses (FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:2), both of which being
   agnostic to SID.  Otherwise, the involved addresses are unicast or
   anycast addresses which are not anymore dependent on SID as
   prescribed by SID6.  The resulting link prefixes (global routing
   prefix + null) advertised by all routers within a site are the same,
   except for the inter-router point-to-point links [p2p127].  Although
   substantially simplifying router configuration in regard to prefix
   loading, this SID deprecation necessitates a change in on-link
   determination.  The original ND [NDv6] specifies that an address is
   considered to be on-link if:

   1.  it is covered by one of the link's prefixes (e.g., as indicated
       by the on-link flag in the Prefix Information option), or

   2.  a neighboring router specifies the address as the target of a
       Redirect message.

   3.  a (solicited) Neighbor Advertisement message is received for the
       (target) address, or

   4.  any ND message is received from the address.

   The latter two, however, have been deprecated by [v6SUBNET].

   Criterion 2 should continue to be valid in SID6.  However, Criterion
   1 is of no more use since all links share the same prefix(es)
   throughout the site, except for the inter-router point-to-point links
   [p2p127].  Hence, a prefix with the on-link flag set is not a
   guarantee that a neighbor address with the very prefix is on-link.

   Since on-link determination cannot be done through prefixes provided
   by a pair procedure of Router Solicitation (RS) and Router
   Advertisement (RA), some other means has to be secured.  We propose




DY Kim                  Expires September 4, 2019               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                    SID6                        March 2019


   to use the Reachability test for the purpose and thus to accommodate
   the following procedure to the ND protocol for on-link determination:

   o  When a node is first injected into a site and attaches to a link,
      it might acquire the prefix information through a pair of RS and
      RA, and auto-configure itself with a node address sanitary-checked
      through DAD described in Section 3.3.  If the node comes from a
      different link in the same site, these steps should be skipped.

   o  It then multicasts an unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement (NA) to
      the link-local All-Nodes address, FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:1, to
      explicitly notify all other nodes on the same link of its
      emergence.  The source address of this NA SHALL be the node
      address of the new node, and its link-layer address SHALL also be
      included as an option.  In addition, a new option SHALL be
      incorporated to indicate that every recipient of this unsolicited
      NA SHOULD return a unicast NS back to the sender.  Since NA
      transmission is unreliable, it can be repeated
      MAX_NEIGHBOR_ADVERTISEMENT times [NDv6] . The first NA SHOULD be
      issued after a random delay between 0 and
      MAX_RTR_SOLICITATION_DELAY [NDv6] to avoid race condition among
      multiple newly emerging nodes.

   o  On receipt of this unsolicited NA, other nodes on the link SHOULD
      return Neighbor Solicitation (NS) back to the new node.  In this
      action, issuing of each NS SHOULD be random delayed to avoid race
      condition.  Also, the link-layer address of the responding node
      SHALL be included in each NS.  Duplicate NAs received through
      retransmission SHALL be silently ignored.

   o  Successful receipt of such a returning NS confirms the forward
      reachability from the new node's perspective; the responding
      address is declared to be on-link.  The new node creates an entry
      for the responding address in Neighbor Cache, with the on-link
      flag set.  This is done for each responding address.

   o  For each of such returning NSs, the new node unicasts an NA to the
      responding address.  Successful receipt of this NA by each
      responding node confirms reachability from the responding node's
      perspective; the address of the new node is on-link.  The
      responding node then creates an on-link entry for the new node's
      address in its own Neighbor Cache.

   o  Addresses in Neighbor Cache of a node acquired only through this
      procedure SHOULD be considered and flagged as on-link.

   This new procedure differs from the existing ND procedure in that on-
   link determination is made not through Prefix List (for prefixes with



DY Kim                  Expires September 4, 2019               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                    SID6                        March 2019


   on-link flag set) but through Reachability tests between neighbors.
   The role of Prefix List reduces simply to providing the common
   prefix(es) for the given site.  Another difference is in regard to
   the semantics of the source address for NA and NS; whereas it is the
   sender's interface address in the original ND, it is its node address
   in SID6.

   With the introduction of this revised procedure for on-link
   determination, it follows that Criterion 3 of the original on-link
   determination SHOULD be revived:

      When a solicited NA message is received for the target address,
      the address is confirmed to be on-link.

   Criterion 4 remains deprecated.

3.3.  Duplicate Address Detection

   DAD per IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) is done for
   all unicast addresses by use of a pair of link-local ND messages,
   namely, NS and NA [SLAAC].  NSs are musticast to link-local
   Solicited-Node address [v6ADDR]:

      link-local Solicited-Node address: FF02:0:0:0:0:1:FFXX:XXXX

   In SID6, however, DAD should be done site-wide, and hence new site-
   local messages should be introduced to do the job.

   We name the new pair of ICMPv6 messages as Duplicate Solicitation
   (DS) and Duplicate Advertisement (DA).  Also, we introduce a new type
   of multicast address named site-local Solicited-Node address defined
   in a way similar to the (link-local) Solicited-Node multicast address
   [v6ADDR]:

      site-local Solicited-Node address: FF05:0:0:0:0:1:FFXX:XXXX

   A site-local Solicited-Node address is formed by taking the low-order
   24 bits of an (unicast or anycast) address and appending those bits
   to the prefix FF05:0:0:0:0:1:FF00::/104 resulting in a multicast
   address in the range

      FF05:0:0:0:0:1:FF00:0000 ~ FF05:0:0:0:0:1:FFFF:FFFF

   A DS is multicast to a site-local Solicited-Node address formed with
   the unicast or anycast address of the target node.  If the target
   address of the returning DA is tentative, it is an indication that
   the address is a duplicate.  Both nodes SHOULD then refresh their
   addresses and repeat DAD until no duplicates are observed.  An

Internet-Draft                    SID6                        March 2019


   address is considered site-unique if none of the tests equivalent to
   the ones in Sec. 5.4 of [SLAAC] indicate the presence of a duplicate
   address within RetransTimer milliseconds after having sent
   DupAddrDetectTransmits DSs.  A natural corollary of this site-wide
   DAD is that uniqueness of the NID(s) is confirmed site-wide.

3.4.  Interior Gateway Protocols

   A link-state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) is to be used in SID6;
   OSPFv3 [OSPFv3] or IS-IS for IPv6 [ISISv6][ISISv4].  The most
   important impact of SID6 on these link-state routing protocols is the
   way routers locate the hosts; they are not anymore locatable by link
   prefixes.

   In SID6 operation of OSPFv3, host routes are to be included in intra-
   area-prefix-LSAs.  For each of these host routes, the PrefixOptions
   LA-bit SHOULD be set and the PrefixLength SHOULD be set to a host
   PrefixLength; see Sec. 4.4.3.9 of [OSPFv3].  In SID6 operation of IS-
   IS for IPv6, host routes are to be included in the IPv6 Reachability
   entries, and will be handled in the same way as other IPv6
   Reachability entries [ISISv6][ISISv4].

   It is to be noted that SID6 of this document focuses on a single-area
   operation in a site.  The multi-area case is left for further study.

3.5.  Other Address-Related Protocols

   DHCPv6 [DHCPv6] is not affected since most addresses involved there
   are link-local.  The site-local All_DHCP_Servers multicast address in
   the case of Relay Agent is also intact for correct operation.

   Default Address Selection [DASv6] is not affected, either.  One thing
   to note is in regard to the scope comparison in selecting a source
   address for a multicast destination address; see Sec. 3.1 of [DASv6].
   The scope of the node address as defined in SID6 is global as well as
   site.  Hence, the same source node address would be selected for a
   multicast destination address of site scope as well as of global
   scope as appropriate.

   No other IPv6-address related protocols are affected, to the best
   knowledge of the author.

3.6.  Generalization

   The description of SID6 so far has been based on nullifying the SID.
   Alternatively, the same field can be used in a way similar to Unique
   IPv6 Prefix Per Host [Uv6pH].  The field originally occupied by SID
   can be populated by random numbers to render intra-site local



DY Kim                  Expires September 4, 2019               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                    SID6                        March 2019


   prefixes.  Each node in the site is then assigned a unique (global ||
   local) prefix:

      IPv6 GUA

         = (node address)

         = (prefix, NID)

         = (global prefix, local prefix, NID)

   How to use this local prefix is up to the discretion of each node.
   If a node is a host, it can generate a 128-bit address by use of the
   combined (global || local) prefix and SLAAC as described in [Uv6pH].
   If a node is a router, it is in fact the border router of a child
   site wherein all internal nodes share the same specific unique
   (global || local) prefix given to the router.

   It is to be noted that, although SID is not there anymore, subnets do
   exist.  The only difference is that, with SID6, a subnet is not
   identified by its SID but by the NID of the Default Router (DR).  DR
   keeps, in its Neighbor Cache, the list of intra-subnet (on-link)
   hosts for relaying packets in and out across the subnet boundary.
   There may, of course, be multiple routers associated with the same
   subnet, and one of them would act as DR as usual.

   As a result of the described generalization, the architecture of SID6
   could be summarized as follows:

   o  A site is a collection of (virtual) nodes wherein all nodes share
      the same prefix.

   o  A subset of directly connected intra-site nodes bordered by one or
      more router(s) is called a subnet.  Thus, a site can also be
      defined as a collection of subnets.  Each subnet is identified by
      the NID of DR.

   o  Intra-site mobility is provided by a link-state routing protocol,
      whereas inter-site mobility is by MIPv6 agents installed on one or
      more site border router(s).

4.  Consequencies

4.1.  No Locator/ID Separation

   SID6 does not introduce a separate number space extra to that already
   existing IPv6 address space; no locator/ID separation (LIS) is
   pursued.  Within a site, the NID identifies a node whose locality is



DY Kim                  Expires September 4, 2019               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                    SID6                        March 2019


   determined through an interior link-state routing protocol.  Between
   sites, the site prefix both identifies and locates a site.

4.2.  Inherent Interior Mobility

   The most important consequence of SID6 is that the node address is
   invariant across links as long as the node resides within a given
   site.  Since the node address is used for transport connections, the
   latter do not break while nodes move around within a site.  That is,
   intra-site node mobility is inherently provided.  Locating a given
   node is done through a normal link-state routing protocol like OSPFv3
   or IS-IS for IPv6.  No extra locators are incorporated in SID6.

   When a given node is a router, node mobility essentially means subnet
   mobility.  A whole subnet, along with the router(s) and attached
   hosts, can move around within a site without losing reachability and
   transport connections.  Instantaneous event-driven link-state updates
   will keep tight track of the moving subnet and its associated nodes.

   A following consequence is that no Mobile IP protocol like MIPv6
   [MIPv6] is necessary for intra-site mobile nodes.  A MIPv6 client
   would be enabled only when a node visits a foreign site, and MIPv6
   agents need be installed only on site border routers, not on every
   intra-site routers.  This simplification may stand for a substantial
   resource saving in providing intra-site mobility.

4.3.  Faster Interior Mobility

   Now a valid question might be whether the intra-site mobility
   provided by link-state routing protocols should be faster or slower
   than that provided by MIPv6-installed intra-site routers.  First of
   all, movement detection by a mobile node should be the same for both
   cases; any of link-layer indication, DR not reachable, or a new
   prefix heard from RA, etc.; see Sec. 11.5.1 of [MIPv6].  Differences,
   if any, should be with the actions taken thereafter.  Typical actions
   by a mobile node after movement detection, in accordance with MIPv6,
   should be:

   1.  Send RS (if no RA heard)

   2.  Receive RA

   3.  Create addresses including care-of-address

   4.  DAD for all unicast addresses

   5.  Register care-of-address with Home Agent (HA)

   Since the prefix acquired in Step 2 should be the same as the one
   already installed on the SID6 mobile node, Step 3 is to be skipped in
   SID6.  Step 4 is not necessary, either, since uniqueness of the
   NID(s) has already been guaranteed by a previous site-wide DAD before
   the move, in accordance with the new DAD procedure introduced in
   Section 3.3.  Saving a DAD could be substantial since it would
   involve a number of message exchanges appended by possible
   retransmissions.

   As for the last step, registering with a MIPv6 HA may consume several
   Binding message exchanges.  In the case of SID6, the modified ND
   procedure described in Section 3.2 would be executed, which would
   then be immediately followed by DR flooding an event-driven link-
   state update to inform all other intra-site routers of the successful
   arrival of the visiting mobile node.  Time lapses caused by the two
   schemes could be considered approximately equal.

   As a result, the time saving in SID6 should be what the address
   creation and a DAD would consume.  Thus, the intra-site mobility
   provided by SID6 should be faster by as much than that by MIPv6.
   This faster mobility would be an advantage in many disruptive
   applications wherein nodes might experience frequent changes in link
   attachment.

4.4.  Legacy Exterior Mobility

   Exterior mobility would be done through MIPv6 as usual.  MIPv6 agents
   need be installed only on site border routers.

4.5.  Legacy Migration and Multihoming

   Renumbering at migration can be done seamlessly as usual.  The site
   would first be multihomed on the old as well as the new upstream
   networks.  Once all nodes are successfully renumbered and
   corresponding DNS records are updated, the old addresses would be
   removed and the site would be single-homed on the new upstream
   network.

   If a host is multihomed on different links within a single-homed
   site, the node would be associated with only one node address since
   the prefixes would be the same for all different links.  The node can
   be reached through any of these links.  With the usual IPv6 or some
   LIS protocols [HIP][ILNP], each interface of the node would be given
   a distinct locator so that the peer node should choose between
   multiple locators to reach the same node, which task being either
   arbitrary or complicated.  With SID6, however, the node is associated
   with a single node address so that there'd be no confusion or extra
   work burden on the part of the peer node.

   If a host is multihomed on different sites, the node would possess
   multiple node addresses each derived from different site prefixes.
   Each of such node addresses is used to reach the node via the
   corresponding site network.

   If a subnet is multihomed on different sites, only the nodes within
   the very subnet would be given multiple node addresses each derived
   from prefixes of the different sites.  Nodes in other subnets would
   not be affected.

   If a site is multihomed on different upstream networks, all internal
   nodes, either hosts or routers, would be given multiple node
   addresses derived from different site prefixes assigned by different
   upstream networks.

4.6.  Incremental Deployability

   SID6 can be deployed incrementally.  A site can adopt SID6, yet the
   external behaviors exposed to DFZ remain the same as with a legacy
   IPv6 site and so cause no disturbance to DFZ.

4.7.  Prefix Aggregation and Scalability

   Prefix aggregation in DFZ is done as usual.  That is, DFZ routing
   scalability of SID6 is as good as the legacy IPv6 networking.

4.8.  Incentives for Deployment

   An apparent incentive to deploy SID6 should be that transport
   connection resilience for intra-site mobile nodes can be provided
   with no extra infrastructure like mapping servers found in most LIS
   protocols [HIP][ILNP][LISP], resulting in a significant resource
   saving.  An equivalent incentive in comparison with the legacy IPv6
   networking would be that intra-site mobility, and that faster, can be
   provided inherently by any interior link-state protocols, with no
   hassle of installing MIPv6 functionalities on every router in a site.
   Considering that a site can be arbitrarily large, this can be a
   considerable additional resource saving in terms of network
   operation.

5.  Conclusions

   A new IPv6 networking paradigm called SID6 is introduced, wherein the
   IPv6 SID is deprecated, that is, set to zero or replaced by a local
   prefix tuple.  As a result, a node is associated with a site-local
   NID, instead of one or more link-local IIDs as with the legacy IPv6
   networking.

   With SID6, the task of simultaneous identification and location of a
   node, wrestled with by other LIS solutions through separate (ID and
   locator) number spaces, is accomplished without introducing a number
   space extra to that already available for node addresses.
   Furthermore, the job is done stepwise across two adjacent tiers;
   intra-site and inter-site:

   o  Within a site (intra-site), identification is provided through the
      NID or the local prefix while location is through an intra-domain
      link-state routing protocol.

   o  Across sites (inter-site), identification is provided through
      (global) node addresses while location is by the site prefix.

   With SID6, there's no need for deployment and management of the
   mapping servers (IDs versus locators), which should be a substantial
   resource saving over usual LIS solutions.

   An additional advantage of SID6 is that intra-site mobility is
   provided inherently by a link-state protocol, and that faster and
   more efficiently than with MIPv6.  Moreover, MIPv6 agents need be
   installed only on site border routers, not on every intra-site
   router, thus resulting in another notable resource saving.

   Behaviors of a SID6 site externally exposed to DFZ remain the same as
   with usual legacy IPv6 sites, enabling incremental deployment.

   This document has presented SID6 only for the case of a single-area
   routing domain.  The case of a multi-area domain is for further
   study.  Application of the equivalent idea to IPv4 networking is also
   left for further study.

6.  Security Considerations

   SID6 should be as secure or insecure as the legacy IPv6 networking.
   As for privacy, there are documents for hiding node locality within a
   site [SLAACPRIV][IIDSv6][IIDOPAQUE].  Randomizing IIDs works fine
   with SID6 since randomizing takes place only at node
   (re-)initialization once or not frequently enough [SLAACPRIV].

   IID hashing is a function of not only the global routing prefix but
   also SID [IIDSv6][IIDOPAQUE]; when a node moves to a foreign link, a
   new IID would be generated to hide the locality of the node from
   other hosts.  In SID6, the hashed NID would not change at such an
   intra-site move, and hence its locality would be exposed.  However,
   this exposure is only to the routers which keep locality information
   of nodes in their routing tables which are opaque to hosts.  Hosts
   have no clues which link other nodes reside in or have moved to,

   except for on-link nodes in Neighbor Cache.  Hosts would simply rely
   on DRs for packet deliveries to off-link nodes.  Therefore, the
   privacy offered by [IIDSv6][IIDOPAQUE] would be scarcely affected.

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no requests to IANA at the current stage of the document.
