                    Segment Routing IPv6 Prefix-SID
                 draft-previdi-isis-ipv6-prefix-sid-00

Abstract

   This document defines the Segment Routing IPv6 Prefix-SID in the
   IPv4/IPv6 Extended Reachability Attribute Flags TLV.  The new flag is
   used for advertising the capability to handle the IPv6 Segment
   Routing header for the prefix that has the flag attached.

1.  Introduction

   With Segment Routing (SR)[I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing], a node
   steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called
   segments.  Segments are identified through Segment Identifiers (SIDs)
   that are advertised by routing protocols.  The IS-IS extensions for
   SR information advertisement are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions].

   Segment Routing can be directly applied to the IPv6 dataplane through
   the use of the Segment Routing Header defined in
   [I-D.previdi-6man-segment-routing-header].

2.  SRv6 Prefix SID

   When SR is applied to the IPv6 dataplane, Segment Identifiers (SIDs)
   are regular IPv6 addresses that are advertised in routing protocols.
   When SR is used over IPv6 dataplane, it is desirable to identify
   which of the prefixes originated by a node can be used as SIDs
   compared to any other prefix that the node advertises.

   [I-D.ietf-isis-prefix-attributes], defines the IPv4/IPv6 Extended
   Reachability Attribute Flags TLV.  This document defines the
   following new flag:

     S6-Flag (bit 3).
             SRv6 Prefix-SID flag: when set, the router
             indicates that the prefix this flag is attached
             to can be used as an IPv6 Prefix-SID.

Internet-Draft               SRv6 Prefix-SID               November 2015


   The S6-Flag may also be set in conjunction with the Node-Flag (Bit 2)
   if the prefix does also identifies the node in the topology.

   In the case where the prefix has a shorter mask-length than 128 or
   when the prefix does not identify the node (e.g.: assigned to a
   physical interface instead of a loopback) the S6-Flag MAY be set and
   the N-flag MUST NOT be set.

   When a prefix is flagged as a SRv6-Prefix-SID, the originating router
   MUST support the IPv6 Segment Routing Header (SRH) and its procedures
   described in [I-D.previdi-6man-segment-routing-header].  Therefore
   the originating router MUST set the H-flag in the SR-Capability
   SubTLV as defined in [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions].

   A router receiving the advertisement of the IPv6 prefix with the
   S6-Flag set MUST check whether the originator has set the H-flag in
   its SR-Capability SubTLV if present in the receiving router link
   state database.

   The S6-Flag has relevance only for IPv6 prefixes.  When processing
   IPv4 prefixes, the S6-Flag MUST be ignored.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces the SRv6-Prefix-SID flag in the Prefix
   Attribute Flags sub-TLV:

   Name       Bit #
   -------    -----
   S6-Flag    3 (suggested value, to be assigned by IANA)

4.  Security Considerations

   This document doesn't introduce new security considerations.
