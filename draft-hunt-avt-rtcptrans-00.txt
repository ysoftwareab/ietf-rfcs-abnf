Abstract

   This memo addresses RTCP reporting by and through RTP translators.
   It collects existing guidance from RFC 3550, systematises
   translators' reporting behaviour by considering potential sources of
   information and the policy-controlled forwarding of such information,
   considers naming issues in labelling reports, considers methods of
   control of reporting behaviour, and presents some examples of
   architectures for reporting.

Internet-Draft        RTCP Reporting by Translators        November 2007


2.  Introduction

   [RFC3550] defines three types of RTP systems which may source and
   sink RTP streams.  These types are RTP end systems, RTP mixers, and
   RTP translators.  For purposes of reporting connection quality to
   other RTP systems, RTP mixers and RTP end systems are very similar.
   Mixers resynchronize audio packets and do not relay RTCP reports
   received from one cloud towards other cloud(s).  Translators do not
   resynchronize packets and SHOULD forward certain RTCP reports between
   clouds.  Translators have a wide range of possible reporting
   behaviours.  This memo is intended to assist readers in thinking
   about the use of RTCP by RTP translators, by collecting relevant
   requirements and architectural considerations.

   An RTP translator is defined in [RFC3550] as "An intermediate system
   that forwards RTP packets with their synchronization source
   identifier intact".  [RFC3550] gives the following examples of
   translators: devices that convert encodings without mixing;
   replicators from multicast to unicast; and application-level filters
   in firewalls.

   For each session, an RTP translator has at least two RTP connections
   via different logical interfaces to network clouds, with logical
   separation based on a transport layer identifier (e.g. by UDP port)
   or at a lower layer (e.g.  IP address, Ethernet VLAN identifier, ATM
   VCI, or physical interface).  RTP traffic streams flowing via these
   two connections may be unicast or multicast, and may be
   unidirectional or bidirectional.  Section 7 of [RFC3550] defines the
   RTCP processing in the translator which is required to maintain
   correct semantics for the RTCP communication between the RTP end
   systems involved in the connection.

   This memo does not try to augment or in any way to modify normative
   text of [RFC3550], but it gathers together the various items of text
   from [RFC3550] which are relevant to RTCP processing and reporting by
   translators.  It attempts to clarify the consequences of the
   recommendations, including those which arise from applying the
   recommendations to RTCP-based reporting beyond the "basic" RTCP
   standardised by [RFC3550].

   The memo attempts to systematise the wide range of possibilities for
   measurement and reporting topologies or architectures which arise
   when RTP translators are capable of making measurements and sending
   the resulting metrics to other RTP systems.  It suggests that it is
   helpful to consider the choices of "what measurements should be sent
   where" as an application of policy.  Different policies lead to
   different tradeoffs between the cost of RTCP processing against the
   level of detailed knowledge which RTCP makes available about the

   performance of a monitored connection.

   Section 3 collects relevant definitions and descriptions of
   recommended behaviour from [RFC3550].

   Section 4 states some known requirements which may be satisfied, or
   partly satisfied, as a result of RTP translators' reporting of packet
   transport metrics.  These have been used to drive the architectural
   suggestions.

   Section 5 provides an architectural analysis of reporting by
   translators.  It considers the sources of the information which might
   be available to an RTP system, and the destinations towards which
   that information might be sent.  It suggests that decisions by each
   RTP system, to transfer information from specific sources or types of
   sources towards specific destinations or types of destinations, may
   be controlled by policy.  The end-to-end measurement architecture
   results from the collective effect of these policy-based decisions
   made at each RTP system.

   In connections involving multiple systems, it is important to know
   which system made the measurements which resulted in a set of
   metrics, and to know which system originated the packet stream which
   is the subject of the measurement.  Section 6 considers the naming
   issues for SSRC and CNAME which arise.

   Some recent groups of metrics have multiple optional sections.  Some
   of these may have significant costs, but may be useful in special
   circumstances, either for specific types of connections or at
   specific times (e.g. for diagnosis).  This raises the question of
   whether, and how, these capabilities might be activated when needed.
   Section 7 outlines possible schemes for control of reporting by
   translators.  As this discussion touches on capabilities of the
   signalling and management planes, which are outside the scope of the
   memo, these methods are discussed only in general terms.

   Section 8 provides some examples of the application of policy to
   create useful monitoring architectures, e.g. to provide useful
   localisation of transport faults whilst bounding the link bandwidth
   and RTP system processing capacity occupied by RTCP.

   [RFC3550] recommends that RTCP packets should be combined to minimise
   header overheads.  Using an example architecture from Section 8,
   Section 9 considers how this might apply to the concatenation of
   reports from multiple translators, and shows a possible benefit in
   determining the order of named systems along a connection path.

   Discussion in this memo is not restricted to any one set of metrics

   within the broad scope of RTCP, such as "basic" RTCP as defined in
   [RFC3550], RTCP XR as defined in [RFC3611], RTCP HR as defined in
   [RTCPHR], or other schemes.  It appears that any RTCP scheme which
   meets the naming requirements of Section 6 may, in principle, be used
   for reporting by an RTP translator.  Individual metrics may not be
   measurable or meaningful when reported by certain types of RTP
   translator, e.g. metrics related to the behaviour of a de-jitter
   buffer may not be relevant to an RTP translator which does not
   contain a de-jitter buffer, but this level of detail is outside the
   scope of the current memo.

3.  Definitions and recommendations from RFC3550

   RFC3550 [RFC3550] explains that RTP translators may be used to
   connect two or more transport-level clouds, and provides a number of
   detailed recommendations on the generation and processing of RTCP by
   RTP translators.  The following excerpts from [RFC3550] include the
   key guidance on processing of RTCP by RTP translators.  Naming-
   related requirements from [RFC3550] are given special attention in
   Section 6 below.

   Section 3 of [RFC3550] provides the following definitions:

   End system: An application that generates the content to be sent in
   RTP packets and/or consumes the content of received RTP packets.  An
   end system can act as one or more synchronization sources in a
   particular RTP session, but typically only one.

   Mixer: An intermediate system that receives RTP packets from one or
   more sources, possibly changes the data format, combines the packets
   in some manner and then forwards a new RTP packet.  Since the timing
   among multiple input sources will not generally be synchronized, the
   mixer will make timing adjustments among the streams and generate its
   own timing for the combined stream.  Thus, all data packets
   originating from a mixer will be identified as having the mixer as
   their synchronization source.

   Translator: An intermediate system that forwards RTP packets with
   their synchronization source identifier intact.  Examples of
   translators include devices that convert encodings without mixing,
   replicators from multicast to unicast, and application-level filters
   in firewalls.

   Section 6.1 of [RFC3550] states:

   It is RECOMMENDED that translators and mixers combine individual RTCP
   packets from the multiple sources they are forwarding into one
   compound packet whenever feasible in order to amortize the packet
   overhead (see Section 7 [of [RFC3550]]).  An example RTCP compound
   packet as might be produced by a mixer is shown in Fig. 1 [of
   [RFC3550]].  If the overall length of a compound packet would exceed
   the MTU of the network path, it SHOULD be segmented into multiple
   shorter compound packets to be transmitted in separate packets of the
   underlying protocol.  This does not impair the RTCP bandwidth
   estimation because each compound packet represents at least one
   distinct participant.  Note that each of the compound packets MUST
   begin with an SR or RR packet.

   Section 7.1 of [RFC3550] summarises the purpose of translators and

   mixers as follows:

   An RTP translator/mixer connects two or more transport-level
   "clouds".  Typically, each cloud is defined by a common network and
   transport protocol (e.g., IP/UDP) plus a multicast address and
   transport level destination port or a pair of unicast addresses and
   ports.  (Network-level protocol translators, such as IP version 4 to
   IP version 6, may be present within a cloud invisibly to RTP.)  One
   system may serve as a translator or mixer for a number of RTP
   sessions, but each is considered a logically separate entity.

   The same Section provides examples of translators, and a further
   definition:

   There may be many varieties of translators and mixers designed for
   different purposes and applications.  Some examples are to add or
   remove encryption, change the encoding of the data or the underlying
   protocols, or replicate between a multicast address and one or more
   unicast addresses.  The distinction between translators and mixers is
   that a translator passes through the data streams from different
   sources separately, whereas a mixer combines them to form one new
   stream.

   Translator: Forwards RTP packets with their SSRC identifier intact;
   this makes it possible for receivers to identify individual sources
   even though packets from all the sources pass through the same
   translator and carry the translator's network source address.  Some
   kinds of translators will pass through the data untouched, but others
   MAY change the encoding of the data and thus the RTP data payload
   type and timestamp.  If multiple data packets are re-encoded into
   one, or vice versa, a translator MUST assign new sequence numbers to
   the outgoing packets.  Losses in the incoming packet stream may
   induce corresponding gaps in the outgoing sequence numbers.
   Receivers cannot detect the presence of a translator unless they know
   by some other means what payload type or transport address was used
   by the original source.

   Section 7.2 of [RFC3550], titled "RTCP Processing in Translators",
   provides the following detailed guidance:

   In addition to forwarding data packets, perhaps modified, translators
   and mixers MUST also process RTCP packets.  In many cases, they will
   take apart the compound RTCP packets received from end systems to
   aggregate SDES information and to modify the SR or RR packets.
   Retransmission of this information may be triggered by the packet
   arrival or by the RTCP interval timer of the translator or mixer
   itself.

Internet-Draft        RTCP Reporting by Translators        November 2007


   A translator that does not modify the data packets, for example one
   that just replicates between a multicast address and a unicast
   address, MAY simply forward RTCP packets unmodified as well.  A
   translator that transforms the payload in some way MUST make
   corresponding transformations in the SR and RR information so that it
   still reflects the characteristics of the data and the reception
   quality.  These translators MUST NOT simply forward RTCP packets.  In
   general, a translator SHOULD NOT aggregate SR and RR packets from
   different sources into one packet since that would reduce the
   accuracy of the propagation delay measurements based on the LSR and
   DLSR fields.

   Section 7.2 of [RFC3550] describes the treatment of each RTCP packet
   type by translators as follows:

   SR sender information: A translator does not generate its own sender
   information, but forwards the SR packets received from one cloud to
   the others.  The SSRC is left intact but the sender information MUST
   be modified if required by the translation.  If a translator changes
   the data encoding, it MUST change the "sender's byte count" field.
   If it also combines several data packets into one output packet, it
   MUST change the "sender's packet count" field.  If it changes the
   timestamp frequency, it MUST change the "RTP timestamp" field in the
   SR packet.

   SR/RR reception report blocks: A translator forwards reception
   reports received from one cloud to the others.  Note that these flow
   in the direction opposite to the data.  The SSRC is left intact.  If
   a translator combines several data packets into one output packet,
   and therefore changes the sequence numbers, it MUST make the inverse
   manipulation for the packet loss fields and the "extended last
   sequence number" field.  This may be complex.  In the extreme case,
   there may be no meaningful way to translate the reception reports, so
   the translator MAY pass on no reception report at all or a synthetic
   report based on its own reception.  The general rule is to do what
   makes sense for a particular translation.

   SDES: Translators typically forward without change the SDES
   information they receive from one cloud to the others, but MAY, for
   example, decide to filter non-CNAME SDES information if bandwidth is
   limited.  The CNAMEs MUST be forwarded to allow SSRC identifier
   collision detection to work.  A translator that generates its own RR
   packets MUST send SDES CNAME information about itself to the same
   clouds that it sends those RR packets.

   BYE: Translators forward BYE packets unchanged.  A translator that is
   about to cease forwarding packets SHOULD send a BYE packet to each
   connected cloud containing all the SSRC identifiers that were

   previously being forwarded to that cloud, including the translator's
   own SSRC identifier if it sent reports of its own.

   APP: Translators forward APP packets unchanged.

4.  Requirements for reporting by translators

   [Editor's note: it is intended that requirements are added to this
   section during the development of the draft.  Community input is
   requested either directly as requirements or as scenarios which might
   lead to additional requirements.  Any additional requirements will be
   taken into account in enhancing proposals and descriptions of options
   in other sections of the draft.]

   Apart from the RTP/RTCP protocol-based requirements listed in
   Section 3 above, which must be satisfied when translators process or
   report RTCP, there are also motivating requirements which drive the
   introduction of these capabilities.

   Operators' and users' objectives in implementing and using
   performance monitoring may include some or all of the following:

   o  to determine packet transport performance for their own and peer
      networks,

   o  to detect faulty packet transport,

   o  to prove faults or poor performance to a single operator's area of
      responsibility or to a point-to-point link (demarcation),

   o  to key monitoring results against individual customer RTP
      sessions, for correlation with subsequent user-reported faults,
      and

   o  to use monitoring results either alone, or (preferably) in
      conjunction with data describing characteristics and performance
      of media terminals and any other networks involved in the
      connection, to form estimates of media quality experienced by end
      users

5.  Architectural analysis

   RTCP reception reports may be produced by any of the types of RTP
   systems which are defined in [RFC3550] as capable of receiving RTP
   packets, that is, by an RTP end system, by an RTP mixer, or by an RTP
   translator.  Here, RTCP reports include "basic" RTCP RR packets
   [RFC3550], or other types of RTCP reception reports including those
   defined in [RFC3611], [RTCPHR], or further reports which may be
   defined in future.

   [Editor's note - need to add references to relevant work on quality
   monitoring schemes for video and possibly other media]

   For purposes of sending reports about distribution quality, a mixer
   is somewhat similar to an end system, since mixers resynchronize
   audio packets before transmission and do not forward either reception
   reports from contributing sources towards the destination of the
   mixed output RTP stream.  However an RTP translator has RTP
   interfaces in more than one transport-level "cloud", but does not
   resynchronize audio packets in transit between "clouds".  Of course,
   like translators, mixers also have interfaces in multiple clouds
   which participate in the same RTP session and share the session's
   SSRC/CSRC space, but the mixer's outgoing RTP packets are labelled
   with the mixer's SSRC.

   Hence it is expected that the information provided by RTP translators
   to other RTP systems will be primarily about transport quality.  If
   RTP mixers provide information to other RTP systems, the main focus
   may be on higher-level metrics of application quality.  An example
   from the voice domain might be an RTP mixer acting as a conference
   bridge, which could provide information about echo-path delay and
   attenuation for connection to each of the participants.

   [Editor's note: Reporting by mixers is outside the current scope of
   this memo, but need to ensure that any statements which *are* made
   are not controversial or contradictory]

   An RTP translator may:

   o  forward RTCP reports generated by RTP systems in one cloud towards
      RTP systems in another cloud, possibly with modification

   o  generate its own RTCP reports and send them to one or more of the
      clouds to which it is connected.

   An RTP translator has several potential sources of information about
   transport and application quality in a session.  These include




Hunt                      Expires May 15, 2008                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft        RTCP Reporting by Translators        November 2007


   o  RTCP (including XR) reports received from RTP end systems and
      mixers

   o  RTCP (including XR) reports received from other translators

   o  Measurements made locally on incoming RTP streams at the
      translators' interfaces

   (Here and in the following, RTCP XR is used to include both the RTCP
   XR report blocks defined in [RFC3611] and other XR report blocks
   defined elsewhere, such as in [RTCPHR], which use the infrastructure
   defined in [RFC3611].)

   In general, it is a matter of policy whether each of these types of
   information should be reported or forwarded by the translator towards
   neighbouring RTP systems involved in the same session.  The objective
   of this policy may be to ensure that sufficient information is
   available to support network and service management at RTP systems,
   whilst avoiding excessive RTCP processing.

   Where a translator forms a boundary between service providers'
   domains, a provider may wish to apply policy to restrict the release
   of network performance information towards the provider's peer.  This
   suggests that policy controlling reporting and forwarding of RTCP
   information (including XR) might be configurable differently for each
   network interface, and may be chosen differently for each session if
   the translator is capable of this level of control.  This allows
   certain types of RTCP reports for the session to be sent outwards via
   one subset of the translator's interfaces involved in the session,
   whilst restricting reporting and forwarding outwards via another
   subset.

   The following behaviours are potentially useful at a translator:

   o  RTCP [RFC3550] reports received from an upstream RTP end system or
      mixer might be forwarded towards the downstream RTP end systems or
      mixers involved in the session.  This behaviour is recommended by
      [RFC3550] to maintain the integrity of the RTCP connection between
      the RTP end systems involved in the connection.  We call this
      behaviour "a" to aid discussion below of the examples of end-to-
      end capabilities.

   o  RTCP XR reports received from an upstream RTP end system or mixer
      might be forwarded towards the downstream RTP end systems or
      mixers involved in the session.  We call this behaviour "b".

   o  The results of measurements made on an RTP stream received at one
      of the translator's network interfaces might be sent out as RTCP



Hunt                      Expires May 15, 2008                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft        RTCP Reporting by Translators        November 2007


      XR reports towards neighbouring RTP systems, either upstream in
      the direction towards the RTP system which originated the RTP
      stream (behaviour "c1"), or downstream in the direction towards
      the RTP system(s) which will receive the translated RTP stream
      (behaviour "c2"), or both upstream and downstream (described as
      behaviour "c1+c2").

   o  RTCP XR reports received from an upstream RTP translator might be
      forwarded towards the downstream RTP end systems or mixers
      involved in the session.  We call this behaviour "d".

   Guidance in Section 7.2 of [RFC3550] (see Section 3 above) on RTCP
   processing in RTP translators requires translators to modify RTCP to
   reflect the translator's processing of RTP media packets.  If such
   modification is necessary it would apply to packets forwarded under
   all the behaviours "a", "b", "c2" and "d".  It would not apply to
   behaviour "c1" where a report is returned to the cloud which
   originated the stream which is the subject of the report.  The
   details of any necessary modification are determined by the details
   of the RTP translation and are outside the scope of this memo.

   Material in Section 8 illustrates how policies may be applied to
   control these measuring, reporting and forwarding behaviours, and
   hence achieve potentially useful end-to-end reporting modes.

6.  Naming considerations

   Section 6.1 collects the requirements from [RFC3550] related to
   naming.  In the context of RTP and RTCP, naming relates to the choice
   of values for SSRC and CNAME at an RTP system, and how SSRC and CNAME
   are used in RTCP reports to other RTP systems.

   Section 6.2 discusses how compliance with these naming requirements
   allows the identification of the RTP system which made a set of
   measurements, and the RTP system which originated the measured
   stream.

   Section 6.3 discusses, in very general terms, how names might be used
   when reporting results 'upwards' to the signalling or management
   planes.

6.1.  SSRC and CNAME requirements from RFC3550

   Allocation of SSRC by RTP systems is described in detail in Section 8
   of [RFC3550].  Similarly the allocation of CNAME is described in
   detail in section 6.5.1 of [RFC3550].  This material is not repeated
   here.

   Section 7.2 of [RFC3550] makes the following statement about SSRC
   allocation for translators:

   A translator does not require an SSRC identifier of its own, but MAY
   choose to allocate one for the purpose of sending reports about what
   it has received.  These would be sent to all the connected clouds,
   each corresponding to the translation of the data stream as sent to
   that cloud, since reception reports are normally multicast to all
   participants.

   Section 6.5.1 of [RFC3550] places a requirement on certain types of
   translators to have the capability to translate a CNAME.  This is
   likely to apply mainly to connections involving RTP systems which use
   their IPv4 address as a CNAME.

   Restating a naming-related requirement from Section 7.2 of [RFC3550]
   already given above:

   A translator that generates its own RR packets MUST send SDES CNAME
   information about itself to the same clouds that it sends those RR
   packets.

   Application writers should be aware that private network address
   assignments such as the Net-10 assignment proposed in RFC 1918 may
   create network addresses that are not globally unique.  This would

Internet-Draft        RTCP Reporting by Translators        November 2007


   lead to non-unique CNAMEs if hosts with private addresses and no
   direct IP connectivity to the public Internet have their RTP packets
   forwarded to the public Internet through an RTP-level translator.
   (See also RFC 1627.)  To handle this case, applications MAY provide a
   means to configure a unique CNAME, but the burden is on the
   translator to translate CNAMEs from private addresses to public
   addresses if necessary to keep private addresses from being exposed.

   In this memo we assume that RTP systems comply with these normative
   requirements of [RFC3550].

6.2.  Identification of RTCP reports

   An RTP system which sends out a report about packets it has sent
   (such as the RTCP SR packet defined in [RFC3550]) includes its own
   SSRC as part of the SR.  It also provides an RTCP SDES packet
   containing (at least) its own SSRC and CNAME, to bind SSRC to CNAME.
   For "basic" RTCP, this is required by the normative text in sections
   6.1 and 6.4.1 of [RFC3550].  For RTCP XR, it is required by normative
   text in section 2 of [RFC3611].  For RTCP HR [RTCPHR] (work in
   progress), which uses the infrastructure for extended reports created
   by [RFC3611], it is likewise required by normative text in section 2
   of [RFC3611].

   An RTP system which sends out a report about packets it has received
   (such as the RTCP RR packet defined in [RFC3550]) includes the SSRC
   of the RTP system which originated the received stream.  For "basic"
   RTCP this is required by the text in section 6.4.2 of [RFC3550].  For
   RTCP XR this is required by normative text in section 4 of [RFC3611]
   and for RTCP HR (work in progress) it is required by normative text
   in section 3.1 of [RTCPHR].

   [RFC3550] recommends that RTP mixers send out multiple SDES packets
   to bind contributing source (CSRC) identifiers to these sources'
   CNAMEs.  However it is not necesary for a receiving RTP end system
   (named B) to send out SDES packets to bind a stream-source's SSRC in
   a receiver report (RR) to the corresponding CNAME of the RTP system
   (named A) which originated the measured stream.  It is assumed that
   any RTP system which receives the RTCP RR sent by B (containing A's
   SSRC but not A's CNAME) will also receive an RTCP packet from the
   stream sender A, which will contain an SR and an SDES packet.  This
   SDES binds A's SSRC to A's CNAME.

   Section 7.2 of [RFC3550] (as repeated above) requires that an RTP
   translator which sends RRs (and by extension other kinds of reception
   report such as RTCP XR or RTCP HR reports) must send SDES information
   about itself along with these reception reports.  Although the
   allocation of an SSRC by an RTP translator is only permissive in



Hunt                      Expires May 15, 2008                 [Page 16]

Internet-Draft        RTCP Reporting by Translators        November 2007


   [RFC3550], it appears that the obligation to send SDES information
   also mandates the allocation of an SSRC if the RTP translator wishes
   to send any kind of reception report (RTCP RR or any kind of RTCP XR
   report).

   RTP translators may make measurements related to RTP packet streams
   from multiple sources.  However translators (by definition) forward
   RTP packets with their SSRC unchanged, and also forward the sender's
   necessary RTCP SDES information.  Hence there is no requirement for
   RTP translators to create RTCP SDES packets describing the RTP
   systems which are the sources of the streams measured at the RTP
   translator.  The translator may assume that RTP systems which receive
   the translator's reception reports for a stream from any given RTP
   sender will also receive forwarded SDES information describing that
   sender.  Typically these SDES items will be forwarded by the same
   translator, as part of its required behaviour.

6.3.  Naming in reports to control layers

   RTP systems are typically controlled by functions in the signalling
   and/or management planes, and it is often useful to send measurement
   results either to, or via, these higher-layer entities.  Delivery
   mechanisms include (but are not restricted to):

   o  Statistics Descriptors in H.248/MEGACO packages [H.248]

   o  Entries in SNMP MIBs [RFC4711]

   o  The proposed mechanism using SIP PUBLISH or NOTIFY messages
      [SIPSUMM]

   o  Ad-hoc mechanisms using Call Detail Records (CDRs)

   As discussed above for reporting within the RTP layer, it is usually
   necessary to label measurement results with the identity of the RTP
   system which made the measurement (the Measuring Point), and with the
   identity of the RTP system which originated the measured stream (the
   Originating Point).  In addition when reports are sent out of the RTP
   layer 'upwards' to systems in the signalling or management planes, it
   may be useful to label the measurement results with the identity of
   the RTP system which made the report upwards (the Reporting Point).

   The SSRC identifier may convey no meaning to signalling or management
   systems which do not receive RTCP SDES packets.  It is likely to be
   more useful to label measurement results with the CNAMEs of the RTP
   systems involved rather than with their SSRCs.  An exception arises
   in cases where some binding information may be missing, and higher
   layer systems may still be able to deduce useful information about

   the connection if SSRC information is provided.  For example, it
   might be possible to deduce that several reports provided
   measurements of the same RTP stream.  It is relatively cheap to
   provide SSRC information in addition to CNAME.

7.  Control of reporting by translators

   Some recent schemes for monitoring [RFC3611][RTCPHR] have multiple
   optional groups of metrics.  Some of these have significant costs in
   processing or bandwidth, but may be useful in special circumstances,
   either for specific types of connections or at specific times (e.g.
   for diagnosis).  This raises the question of whether, and how, these
   capabilities might be activated when needed.  This section outlines
   possible schemes for control of reporting by translators.  As this
   discussion touches on capabilities of the signalling and management
   planes, which are outside the scope of the memo, these methods are
   discussed only in general terms.

   The first and simplest scheme is that any optional capabilites are
   enabled (or not) by configuration data in every participating RTP
   system.  This solution may be satisfactory for RTP systems in a small
   and/or homogeneous network.  However it is unlikely that large
   populations of independently controlled terminals and RTP translators
   will be configured in compatible ways.  The problem is similar to
   that of ensuring that a compatible codec is chosen to enable end-to-
   end communication.  Any modification of the level of reporting, e.g.
   for diagnostics, would need to be a coordinated change of
   configuration data across multiple systems.

   If the RTCP monitoring and reporting capability is to be controlled
   dynamically on a per-connection basis, it is assumed that the SDP
   Offer/Answer model [RFC4566][RFC3264] will be used to signal that an
   RTP end system wishes to receive metrics of a specific kind.  This is
   in line with some existing practice [RFC3611], and parallels the use
   of SDP to select a compatible codec.

   We assume that "basic" RTCP SR and RR will always be sent, as they
   are not optional in [RFC3550].  Hence SDP will typically be used to
   control additional reporting, probably RTCP XR based.

   Assuming SDP Offer/Answer is used, there is still the question of the
   granularity of control.  Some of the options are as follows:

   o  SDP selects only the top-level protocol (e.g., selects RTCP XR
      [RFC3611] or RTCP HR [RTCPHR]).  The selection of optional
      capabilities within the chosen top-level protocol would still
      require configuration at each RTP system, hence would still be a
      likely source of incompatibility.

   o  SDP controls each reporting option individually, both to determine
      the top-level protocol and to determine options within the
      protocol.  This is the design choice made in [RFC3611] where
      options within the protocol are defined as XR report block types,



Hunt                      Expires May 15, 2008                 [Page 19]

Internet-Draft        RTCP Reporting by Translators        November 2007


      and these block types (and, in some cases, options within them)
      have SDP parameters registered with IANA.  This has the advantage
      that, if a device implements a specific monitoring standard, it
      can provide any subset of that standard on request.  However, the
      amount of SDP data may become significant.

   o  SDP indicates the choice of a profile.  The profile is registered.
      It specifies all the monitoring capabilities and probably also a
      set of preferred forwarding policies which achieve the desired
      end-to-end monitoring architecture.  This has the advantage that a
      very small amount of SDP data in signalling (typically a single
      integer of SDP "payload") can select from a wide range of
      potentially complex behaviour in an RTP system.  The disadvantage
      is that the RTP systems must implement the chosen profiles, so
      there will be a time lag between definition of a profile and its
      becoming available in equipment.  To mitigate against this, a
      number of profiles could be defined at the same time as any new
      proposal for monitoring.  These might include profiles for both
      "normal" and "diagnostic" purposes.  The latter might include more
      detailed metrics and/or changed policies for forwarding
      measurements.

   Of course, local policy may override a request for a specific
   monitoring behaviour if there are strong reasons to do so, such as a
   perceived threat to security or performance.

   SDP may be originated at RTP end systems and carried in signalling
   such as SIP [RFC3261].  In some cases SIP and its SDP attachment may
   be routed via a system (such as an application-layer gateway) which
   also contains the RTP translator function.  In this case it may need
   only simple local communication to provide the RTP system with
   information from the signalling plane.  Alternatively the RTP
   translator may be physically separated from nodes in the signalling
   path.  In the latter case, the SDP Offer/Answer exchange may be
   extended to the RTP translator over a gateway control protocol such
   as H.248/MEGACO [H.248].

8.  Example applications

   This section defines three potentially useful modes for reporting by
   translators and shows how each one may be implemented by consistent
   choices of policy at each RTP system which participates in the
   connection.  These are "uniform" in the sense that the same policy is
   applied at each system of a given type.

   A further example illustrates the application of the same principles
   to a less uniform scenario in which an RTP end system is made
   responsible for reporting results which were measured by an RTP
   translator.

   "End system peering" is a mode in which a translator forwards RTCP
   reports originating from an RTP end system towards other RTP end
   systems (possibly with some modification consistent with the
   translation which it performs [RFC3550]).  RTCP reports received from
   an end system are forwarded towards the same destination(s) as the
   destination(s) of the RTP packets received at the same interface as
   that at which the RTCP reports were received.  This is the minimum
   which a translator must do to maintain the integrity of RTCP
   communication between the end systems.  In end system peering mode,
   the translator does not originate any RTCP reports based on any
   measurements which it may make locally.

   A minimum "End system peering" behaviour is realised by application,
   at each RTP translator, of policy "a" from Section 5 above.  This
   passes only "basic" RTCP between RTCP end systems.  If policy "b" is
   also included, RTP end systems' XR reports are also passed between
   RTP end systems.

   "Local reporting" is a mode in which the translator forwards the end
   systems' reports as in "end system peering" mode, to maintain RTCP
   communication between end systems.  In addition, the translator makes
   measurements on the RTP stream arriving at each receive transport
   interface, creating associated RTCP reports.  These RTCP reports are
   sent by the translator both towards the source and destination(s) of
   the monitored RTP stream.  However, the translator does not forward
   RTCP reports generated by other translators.  "Local reporting" mode
   allows translators to assist in localising transport faults, whilst
   keeping RTCP traffic and processing bounded in systems which use
   large numbers of translators.

   "Local reporting" behaviour is realised by application, at each RTP
   translator, of policies "a", "b" and "c1+c2" from Section 5 above.

   "Global reporting" is a mode in which the translator forwards the end
   systems' reports as in "end system peering" mode, to maintain RTCP



Hunt                      Expires May 15, 2008                 [Page 21]

Internet-Draft        RTCP Reporting by Translators        November 2007


   communication between end systems.  In addition the translator makes
   measurements on the RTP stream arriving at each receive transport
   interface, creating associated RTCP reports.  These RTCP reports are
   sent by the translator both towards the source and destination(s) of
   the RTP stream.  Finally, the translator also forwards RTCP reports
   generated by other translators, but only towards the same
   destination(s) as the destination(s) of the RTP stream received at
   the same interface as that at which the RTCP reports were received.
   In particular, no RTCP report received at a translator from a system
   S is ever sent back towards S. "Global reporting" provides complete
   transport metrics to every RTP system involved in a session.  In
   particular, end systems receive reports of measurements made on RTP
   streams at all receive interfaces of every translator.  However, the
   volume of RTCP traffic and RTCP processing may become excessively
   large in networks, or collections of networks, which use large
   numbers of translators.

   "Global reporting" behaviour is realised by application, at each RTP
   translator, of all the policies "a", "b", "c1+c2" and "d" from
   Section 5 above.

   The following application example illustrates that the policy-based
   approach is also capable of meeting specific, less uniform
   requirements.  This arises in a provider P1's voice network which has
   a connection to the network of a second provider P2.  P1's network
   contains an RTP end system, and an application layer gateway which
   provides a connection to a P2's network.  P2's network might be a
   transit or terminating network.  P1's application layer gateway
   (ALG1) is connected to P2's application layer gateway (ALG2), via a
   point-to-point link or a routed network.  ALG1 and ALG2 provide a
   symmetric security barrier at the P1-to-P2 network-to-network
   interface.  We assume that both ALGs are RTP translators with
   measurement capabilities and RTCP-based reporting capabilities.  We
   assume also that both operators are willing to operate their sections
   of the connection in "local reporting" mode.  This includes sending
   results of their respective ALG's measurements across the network-to-
   network interface, to assist their peer operator in detecting and
   localising transport faults.

   Ideally P1 would like to transfer the results of ALG1's measurements,
   and the reports which ALG1 receives as local reports from ALG2,
   directly into P1's management plane.  However in this case ALG1 has
   no capability to report its measurement results "upwards" to
   signalling or management planes, although P1's RTP end system does
   have this capability.  P1 defines policy "a", "b" and "c1+c2" for
   reports outgoing via ALG1's interface facing ALG2, in order to
   achieve the agreed "local reporting" behaviour at the network-to-
   network interface.  In addition, however, P1 defines policies "a",

   "b", "c1+c2" and "d" for reports outgoing via ALG1's interface to the
   inside of P1's network.  The effect is that ALG1 relays (towards P1's
   RTP end system) all the reports which the RTP translator ALG2
   measured and sent to ALG1.

   ALG1's behaviour is asymmetric, in that it would not forward out of
   its outside interface (towards ALG2) any reports from other RTP
   translators inside P1's network.  However for the connection
   described, this asymmetry is not expressed, because ALG1 receives
   into its inside interface only reports from P1's RTP end system.
   According to policy "b" in force at ALG1's outside interface, such
   reports are forwarded to ALG2.

9.  Combining RTCP packets from multiple sources

   As stated above in Section 3, Section 6.1 of [RFC3550] recommends
   that translators and mixers combine individual RTCP packets from the
   multiple sources they are forwarding into one compound packet
   whenever feasible in order to amortize the packet overhead.  However,
   section 7.2 of [RFC3550] warns that translators should not aggregate
   SR and RR packets from different sources because this would degrade
   the accuracy of round-trip delay measurements based on the LSR and
   DLSR fields.  This guidance is aimed at multicast connections
   implementing "basic" RTCP, but it may be extended to warn against the
   aggregation of any other system's RTCP packets with packets
   originated by RTP end systems and containing SR/RR information.

   This section suggests a method of aggregation which might reduce
   packet overhead in cases where translators forward reports from other
   translators.  We suggest that RTP end systems might send all their
   RTCP information in a single compound RTCP packet which includes both
   the "basic" RTCP SR/RR information defined in [RFC3550], including
   the LSR and DLSR fields, and any RTCP XR information which the RTP
   end system wishes to send.  RTP translators which forward RTCP
   reports from other translators are assumed to comply with the
   intention of Section 7.2 of [RFC3550], and hence will not attempt to
   combine their own RTCP reports with reports received from RTP end
   systems.  This behaviour will help to avoid degradation of round-trip
   delay measurements.  However RTP translators might concatenate their
   own RTCP reports with RTCP reports from peer translators which they
   choose to forward.  If RTP translators append their own report to the
   end of a compound packet which they choose to forward, the order of
   concatenated RTCP blocks will be the same as the order in which
   network segments are traversed.  This might be helpful in determining
   the ordering of RTP translators along the connection and hence in
   fault localisation for complex, multi-translator connections.

   This behaviour is described below with respect to the following
   example of a bidirectional unicast connection between RTP end systems
   A and Z using three translators J, K, and L:


                ----     -----     -----     -----     ----
               |   T|-->|1R 2T|-->|1R 2T|-->|1R 2T|-->|R   |
               | A  |   |  J  |   |  K  |   |  L  |   |  Z |
               |   R|<--|1T 2R|<--|1T 2R|<--|1T 2R|<--|T   |
                ----     -----     -----     -----     ----

                 Figure 1: Connection with 3 translators.

   [Editors notes: Need to consider desirable behaviour for RTP
   translators which do not support specific blocks which may arrive
   from other RTP systems.  If translation is transport-level only,
   probably best to forward unchanged apart from appropriate transport-
   header modifications, but if translation is application-level (e.g.
   codec, packetisation time) then semantics might be wrong so better to
   discard?]

   In the first example, Figure 2, translators implement policies "a",
   "b", "c1+c2" and "d" of Section 5.  The result is that the connection
   operates in the mode called "Global Reporting" of Section 8 above, in
   which all measurements by translators are forwarded by other
   translators, ultimately reaching end systems.  Without concatenation,
   this set of policies results in a large number of separate RTCP
   packets.

   In Figure 3, concatenation is applied to reduce the number of
   separate RTCP packets, here to 3.  The packet labelled "RTCP(A.R)" is
   the report from the end system, identified because its SSRC is the
   same as the SSRC of the RTP flow in the same direction.  This is
   forwarded without concatenation.  The packet labelled RTCP(J.1R,
   K.1R, L.1R) contains translator reports of measurements made on the
   RTP flow from A to Z, identified because they report the measured
   flow having SSRC equal to the SSRC of A. The packet labelled RTCP
   (J.2R,K.2R,L.2R) contains translator reports of measurements made on
   the RTP flow from Z to A, identified because they report the measured
   flow having SSRC equal to the SSRC of Z.

    Figure 3: Proposed multiplexing scheme of the Global reporting mode

   In the second example, Figure 4 translators implement policies "a",
   "b", and "c1+c2" of Section 5.  The result is that the connection
   operates in the mode called "Local Reporting" described in Section 8
   above, in which measurements by each translator are sent to the
   nearest-neighbour RTP system in each direction but are not forwarded
   further.  Even without concatenation, this set of policies results in
   a maximum of three RTCP packets in each direction on each link (per
   RTCP measurement cycle).  There is no opportunity for concatenation
   in this mode.

11.  Security Considerations

   There are known security considerations for the operation of RTP
   translators and mixers which have been documented in [TOPO] (work in
   progress).

   However, this document itself contains no normative text and hence
   should not give rise to any new security considerations, to be
   confirmed.
