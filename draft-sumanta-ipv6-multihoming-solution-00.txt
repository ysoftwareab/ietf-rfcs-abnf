        IPv6 Multihoming with transparent End-to-End connectivity
        draft-sumanta-ipv6-multihoming-solution-00

Abstract

Ipv6 Multihoming for Host could be implemented using Ipv6-to-Ipv6 
Network prefix translation (NPTv6), however NPTv6 not ideal as this
 solution not achieve End-to-End transparency of connectivity. 
Basic issues with End host Multihoming architecture without 
NPTv6 are: 
 1. Source address selection, 2. Next hop selection 
        and 3. DNS resolution.
 One other approach to solve above mention all three issues with 
End-to-End transparent connectivity would be using policy at 
End host to enforce source address and next hop selection. 
In this document,a solution being propose to solve all above 
mention three problem enhancing policy based enforcement on host 
directed by router using its router advertisement.This document 
not obsolete any of the previous work,only propose how policy 
on End-host can be enforce from router by mapping destination 
prefix with DNS via Router Advertisement.

1.  Introduction



Multi Homing has been architect to exchange IP packet uninterruptedly 
from local host to remote host or vice versa even when underlying 
connectivity change dynamically. It is being designed to support change 
in path without knocking session of the application.

Network Address and port Translation (NAPT) one of the solution which 
being used in Ipv4 Multihoming scenario also can be used in Ipv6. 
Ipv6-to-Ipv6 network prefix translation (NPTV6) work on basic principle,
 End host address being mapped with a global address and confined 
End host address visibility from outside network. Non visibility 
nature of Network address translation prevent End-to-end transparency.
 Unlike Ipv6, in Ipv4 where global address are scarce resource, 
Network Address Translation could be ideal solution.  That unlikely 
the case on IPv6. Hence, end host address visibility is the primary goal
 in Ipv6 solution space. As Network address translation confined address
 visibility, make it obvious not to consider as No1 solution in Ipv6. 
End host configure with multiple Ipv6 address from each service provider 
address space and use of Ipv6 specification to achieve switch over among
 service provider and drop free forwarding consider to be best solution. 
Adequate number of Ipv6 global unique address make easy to implement 
end host with multiple unique service provider dependent global IPv6 
address for each connected different service provider.This further 
ensure end-to-end transparent connection unlike NAT.However there are 
several issue in this kind of implementation or design, Herein 
summarizing all issues with different use case topologies: 
      A. Wrong Source address selection. 
      B. Wrong Next hop selection.
      C. Private and public RDNSS co-existence.
On way to get ride off above mention issues on multi address assigned 
end host implementation would be using policy on end host to select 
Source address and Next hop.
Depends on different uses case, end host policy define may a burden some
activity and difficult to achieve complete error free.Complexity arise
due to multiple next hop, source address and DNS presence and any wrong
combination will raise reachability issue or ingress filtering on 
service provider ingress end. It further complicate on deployment where
local destination reachable via a particular site and remote destination
reachable via multiple sites.  Further, manual policy configuration on 
end host subjected to changeable whenever service provider's or local
site's DNS,default gate way router and numerous destination changes.

3.1 Wrong Source address selection.


                When multiple address assigned on End host, End host may 
select different Source address compare to right source address need to
reach via a service provider.  Wrong source address selection does not 
alarming without service provider have ingress filter applied as packet 
with any global address perfect to travel global scope. However, 
uncertainty on service provider ingress filter presence impose packet's 
source address should be particular service provider dependent address. 
Otherwise, will be filter out on service provider network by ingress 
rule.Having different service provider dependent source address compare 
to service provider packet being forwarded consider as wrong source 
address selection.


3.2 Wrong Next hop selection.


End host for all off-link prefix, consider default router address as 
next hop.Default routers are being advertise using dynamic router
advertisement process. Selection of default router is either by 
round robin or by preference setting. Further, end host could be 
router capable and have routing table entry corresponding to different
 destination. However, practice of having routing info limited on End 
host, due to memory and computation requirement.In the case of default
 router scenario host May chose a next hop which does not have 
reachability to reach particular destination.  There could be scenario,
 internet destination reachable via multiple service provider sites.

Internet-Draft                   ISC                March 02,2016 
To reach internet destination, selection of next hop does not matter 
for data packet transfer. But to reach DNS to resolve domain name, 
selection of next hop is vital. If next hop being chosen wrongly, 
packet will reach to wrong DNS and will be discarded.  Similarly for 
data packet when destination must be routed through a particular local 
site, next hop selection play a pivotal role on successful packet 
delivery.



3.3 Private and Public RDNSS co-existence. 



In an implementation End host have to contact local site deployed DNS to 
resolve organization internal destination, also end host have to 
contact service provider DNS to resolve internet destination. Such 
implementation referred as private and public RDNSS co-existence. 
Typical issue with this implementation , end host does not has clue 
which DNS to reach for which destination URL ,wrong destination choice 
will lead to unsuccessful attempts on address resolve process . Even if 
selection of DNS problem being bell out,further packet forwarding should
be with same source address and next hop.Otherwise packet will not get
fate to reach final destination. Such way,presence of private and 
public RDNSS co-existence provoke more complex issue regards to source
 address and next hop selection.

5.1 Next Hop selection


   Network designer or Administrator should provision router to aware 
of DNS address and service provider prefix which end host will use as 
DNS address to resolve destination URL and provided prefix to build up 
its interface address respectively.  Administrator should provision 
correct mapping of this information, so that when end host select 
service provider prefix corresponding address as source address and 
pair DNS address , packet forward successfully. Also, particular router
 is the prefer router to reach destination for both DNS traffic and 
data traffic using corresponding service provider dependent source 
address.This should be ensure for error free traveling to destination 
with correct mapping of source address and next hop. Further Router 
will send router advertisement with router information list carrying 
DNS server prefix with prf value as high. By receiving such router 
advertisement, host select advertising router link-local address as 
next hop or default gate way router to reach prefix mention on router
 information list. Hence, to reach particular DNS host will chose 
advertising router as next hop. Further all traffic destined for same
 destination should use same Next hop as its being used to reach DNS 
while discovering domain to address mapping.  In some case host may 
know destination ipv6 address and do not go through DNS resolve process. 
In that circumstances, if destination belongs to particular 
service provider dependent prefix or prefix being advertise through 
Router advertisement on its router information list setting, 
advertising router Link-local address being used as next hop address. 
 In other all case Next hop being selected current rule 
of random selection.

Example : 

In above [Fig 3], consider ISP A DNS server address 101::1 and 
ISP B DNS server address 202::1.  When rtr1 send RA message 
along with all info it's propagate to host,Recursive DNS option, 
DNS search list option; it's also should add Router 
information option , for prefix 101::1/128. By receiving such RA, 
host will set highest default router as rtr1 link-local address 
for 101:: 1/128 prefix. Similarly, rtr2's link-local will be 
considered as highest default router for prefix 202:: 1/128.Now 
there is no difficulty to select correct next hop. If host want 
to resolve via ISP A, it will choose rtr1 and when 
via ISP B it will choose rtr2.



5.2 Source Address Selection 

          Similar to Next hop rule , Network designer or 
Administrator should provision router to aware of service provider 
prefix and DNS address which end host will adopt to build up its 
interface address and to use as DNS to resolve destination URL 
respectively.  Router should hold correct mapping of this information, 
so that if end host wanted to reach any destination including mapping
 DNS using provision prefix corresponding source address, particular
 router should be the next hop. This should be ensure. Router send 
router advertisement with router information list carrying DNS server 
prefix with prf value as high. By receiving such router 
advertisement, hos ensure while advertising router being chosen as 
Next hop address, advertise prefix corresponding address also being
 chosen as source address. Even for the traffic which not going 
through DNS resolve, also should chose source address based on Next 
hop its select. That ensure right choice of source address in all 
implementations and use cases.

                            

Example : 

In above figure [Fig3] rtr1 send RA with prefix 100::/64 to configure
ISP dependent address.  Rtr1 Link-local address is fe80::11 Similarly
rtr2 send  RA with prefix 200::/64 to configure ISP dependent address.
Rtr2 Link-local address is fe80::12 Let consider 400::/64 is the 
destination traffic need to be destine. As this is being off-link 
prefix, traffic is being send base on default router and next hop 
will be selected as either rtr1 or rtr2 link-local address. Proposed 
enhancement will select source as 100::xxxx address when rtr1 is 
being selected as next hop or will select 200::xxx 
address when rtr2 is being selected as next hop.

5.3 Private and Public RDNS co-existence

When a local site have private DNS , router should advertise 
local DNS prefix mapping to DNS search list containing entire 
private domain name. Also, when site local have local destination 
without subject to DNS resolve, those local destination also should 
be advertise on router advertisement in router information list 
setting prf bit high.  In other word, administrator should 
ensure all destination prefixes are being advertise on router 
information list for which particular router must be consider as
 Next hop.  As RFC 4919 already laid guideline,how host should 
behave and which default router would be selected 
 based on router information list prefix and prf bit value further 
not being described here.  Using same guideline and with care full 
declaration of router information list would help to nail down all 
issues related to Next Hop and Source address selection on Private 
and Public RDNS co-existence network.

6. Security Considerations

 Major part of end host police enforcement depends on Router
 advertisement and router information list its carry. Its 
necessary router advertisement should be from a trusted router.
 In a LAN to verify router advertisement from trusted source 
there are already well define solution which carve out Rouge RA 
problem, secure neighbor discovery etc. Also, creation of router

Internet-Draft                   ISC                March 02,2016 
list depends on router aware ness of information which could be 
potential thread of misinform. Careful approach of configuration 
only by authorized network user or Authorized dynamic update process 
should be in place to adhere those information for further use.
