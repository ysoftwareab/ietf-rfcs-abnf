                     BGP Control Plane for NSH SFC
               draft-mackie-bess-nsh-bgp-control-plane-00

Abstract

   This document describes the use of BGP as a control plane for
   networks that support Service Function Chaining (SFC).  The document
   introduces a new BGP address family called the SFC AFI/SAFI with two
   route types.  One route type is originated by a node to advertise
   that it hosts a particular instance of a specified service function.
   This route type also provides "instructions" on how to send a packet
   to the hosting node in a way that indicates that the service function
   has to be applied to the packet.  The other route type is used by a
   Controller to advertise "chains" of service functions, and to give a
   unique designator to each such chain so that they can be used in
   conjunction with the Network Service Header.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   As described in [RFC7498], the delivery of end-to-end services can
   require a packet to pass through a series of Service Functions (SFs)
   (e.g., classifiers, firewalls, TCP accelerators, and server load
   balancers) in a specified order: this is termed "Service Function
   Chaining" (SFC).  There are a number of issues associated with
   deploying and maintaining service function chaining in production
   networks, which are described below.

   Conventionally, if a packet needs to travel through a particular
   service chain, the nodes hosting the service functions of that chain
   are placed in the network topology in such a way that the packet
   cannot reach its ultimate destination without first passing through
   all the service functions in the proper order.  This need to place
   the service functions at particular topological locations limits the
   ability to adapt a service function chain to changes in network
   topology (e.g., link or node failures), network utilization, or
   offered service load.  These topological restrictions on where the
   service functions can be placed raise the following issues:

   1.  The process of configuring or modifying a service function chain
       is operationally complex and may require changes to the network
       topology.

   2.  Alternate or redundant service functions may need to be co-
       located with the primary service functions.

   3.  When there is more than one path between source and destination,
       forwarding may be asymmetric and it may be difficult to support
       bidirectional service function chains using simple routing
       methodologies and protocols without adding mechanisms for traffic
       steering or traffic engineering.

   In order to address these issues, the SFC architecture includes
   Service Function Chains that are built in their own overlay network
   (the service function overlay network), coexisting with other overlay
   networks, over a common underlay network [RFC7665].  A Service
   Function Chain is a sequence of Service Functions through which
   packet flows satisfying specified criteria will pass.

   o  Service Function Type (SFT)

2.  Overview

2.1.  Functional Overview

   In [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh] a Service Function Chain (SFC) is an ordered
   list of Service Functions (SFs).  The Service Path Identifier (SPI)
   is a 24-bit number that identifies a specific SFC, and a Service
   Index (SI) is an 8-bit number that identifies a specific point in
   that chain.  In the context of a particular SFC (identified by an
   SPI), an SI represents a particular Service Function, and indicates
   the order of that SF in the SFC.

   In fact, each SI is mapped to one or more SFs that are implemented by
   one or more Service Function Instances (SFIs) that support those
   specified SFs.  Thus an SI may represent a choice of SFIs of one or
   more Service Function Types.  By deploying multiple SFIs for a single
   SF, one can provide load balancing and redundancy.

   A special Service Function, called a Classifier, is located at each
   ingress point to a service function overlay network.  It assigns the
   packets of a given packet flow to a specific Service Function Chain.
   This may be done by comparing specific fields in a packet's header
   with local policy, which may be customer/network/service specific.
   The classifier picks an SFC and sets the SPI accordingly it then sets
   the SI to the value of the SI for the first hop in the SFC and then
   prepending a Network Services Header (NSH) [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh], to
   that packet containing the assigned SPI/SI.  Note that the Classifier
   and the node that hosts the first Service Function in a Service
   Function Chain need not be located at the same point in the service
   function overlay network.

   Note that the presence of the NSH can make it difficult for nodes in
   the underlay network to locate the fields in the original packet that
   would normally be used to constrain equal cost multipath (ECMP)
   forwarding.  Therefore, it is recommended, as described in
   Section 7.1, that the node prepending the NSH also provide some form
   of entropy indicator that can be used in the underlay network.

   The Service Function Forwarder (SFF) receives a packet from the
   previous node in a Service Function Chain, removes the packet's link
   layer or tunnel encapsulation and hands the packet and the NSH to the
   service function instance for processing.

   When the SFF receives the packet and the NSH back from the SFI it
   must select the next SFI along the chain using the SPI and SI in the

   NSH and choosing between multiple SFIs (possibly of different Service
   Function Types) as described in Section 5.  That is:

   o  The SI in the NSH may indicate:

      *  The next SF along the chain.

      *  A previous SF in the chain: known as "looping" (see Section 6).

      *  An SF further down the chain: known as "jumping" (see also
         Section 6).

   o  The SPI and the SI may point to an SF on a different SFC: known as
      "branching" (see also Section 6).

   Such modifications are limited to within the same service function
   overlay network.  That is, an SPI is known within the scope of
   service function overlay network.  Furthermore, the new SI value is
   interpreted in the context of the SFC identified by the SPI, and SI
   values that do not form part of the definition of the chain are
   invalid.

   An unknown or invalid SPI/SI combination SHALL be treated as an error
   and the SFF MUST drop the packet.  Such errors SHOULD be logged, and
   such logs MUST be subject to rate limits.  See [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh] for
   more details of handling this situation in received NSH packets.

   The SFF then selects an SFI that provides the SF denoted by the SPI/
   SI, and forwards the packet to the SFF that supports that SFI.

2.2.  Control Plane Overview

   To accomplish the function described in Section 2.1, this document
   introduces a new BGP AFI/SAFI [values to be assigned by IANA] for
   "SFC Routes".  Two SFC Route Types are defined by this document: the
   Service Function Instance Route (SFIR), and the Service Function
   Chain Route (SFCR).  As detailed in Section 3, the route type is
   indicated by a sub-field in the NLRI.

   o  The SFIR is advertised by the node hosting the service function
      instance.  The SFIR describes a particular instance of a
      particular Service Function and the way to forward a packet to it
      through the underlay network, i.e., IP address and encapsulation
      information.

   o  The SFCRs are originated by Controllers.  One SFCR is originated
      for each Service Function Chain.  The SFCR specifies:

Internet-Draft               BGP for NSH SFC                October 2016


      A.  the SPI of the chain

      B.  the sequence of SFTs and/or SFIs of which the chain consists

      C.  for each such SFT or SFI, the SI that represents it in the
          identified chain.

   This approach assumes that there is an underlay network that provides
   connectivity between SFFs and Controllers, and that the SFFs are
   grouped to form one or more service function overlay networks through
   which SFCs are built.  We assume BGP connectivity between the
   Controllers and all SFFs within each service function overlay
   network.

   In addition, we also introduce the Service Function Type (SFT) that
   is the category of SF that is supported by an SFF (such as
   "firewall").  An IANA registry of Service Function Types is
   introduced in Section 10.  An SFF may support SFs of multiple
   different SFTs, and may support multiple SFIs of each SF.

   When choosing the next SFI in a chain, the SFF uses the SPI and SI as
   well as the SFT to choose among the SFIs, applying, for example, a
   load balancing algorithm or direct knowledge of the underlay network
   topology as described in Section 4.

   The SFF then encapsulates the packet using the encapsulation
   specified by the SFIR of the selected SFI and forwards the packet.
   See Figure 1.

   Thus the SFF can be seen as a portal in the underlay network through
   which a particular SFI is reached.

   The Route Type field determines the encoding of the rest of the route
   type specific SFC NLRI.

   The Length field indicates the length in octets of the route type
   specific field of the SFC NLRI.

   This document defines the following Route Types:

   1.  Service Function Instance Route (SFIR)

   2.  Service Function Chain Route (SFCR)

   A Service Function Instance Route (SFIR) is used to identify an SFI.
   A Service Function Chain Route (SFCR) defines a sequence of Service
   Functions (each of which has at least one instance advertised in an
   SFIR) that form an SFC.

   The detailed encoding and procedures for these Route Types are
   described in subsequent sections.

   The SFC NLRI is carried in BGP [RFC4271] using BGP Multiprotocol
   Extensions [RFC4760] with an Address Family Identifier (AFI) of TBD1
   and a Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) of TBD2.  The NLRI
   field in the MP_REACH_NLRI/MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute contains the SFC
   NLRI, encoded as specified above.

   In order for two BGP speakers to exchange SFC NLRIs, they must use
   BGP Capabilities Advertisements to ensure that they both are capable
   of properly processing such NLRIs.  This is done as specified in
   [RFC4760], by using capability code 1 (Multiprotocol BGP) with an AFI
   of TBD1 and a SAFI of TBD2.

                  Figure 3: SFIR Route Type specific NLRI

   Per [RFC4364] the RD field comprises a two byte Type field and a six
   byte Value field.  Two SFIs of the same SFT must be associated with
   different RDs, where the association of an SFI with an RD is
   determined by provisioning.  If two SFIRs are originated from
   different administrative domains, they must have different RDs.  In
   particular, SFIRs from different VPNs (for different service function
   overlay networks) must have different RDs, and those RDs must be
   different from any non-VPN SFIRs.

   The Service Function Type identifies a service function, e.g.,
   classifier, firewall, load balancer, etc.  There may be several SFIs
   that can perform a given Service Function.  Each node hosting an SFI
   must originate an SFIR for each SFI that it hosts.  The SFIR
   representing a given SFI will contain an NLRI with RD field set to an
   RD as specified above, and with SFT field set to identify that SFI's
   Service Function Type.  The values for the SFT field are taken from a
   registry administered by IANA (see Section 10).  A BGP Update
   containing one or more SFIRs will also include a Tunnel Encapsulation
   attribute [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps].  If a data packet needs to be
   sent to an SFI identified in one of the SFIRs, it will be
   encapsulated as specified by the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute, and
   then transmitted through the underlay network.

   The association of an SFC with an RD is determined by provisioning.
   If two SFCRs are originated from different Controllers they must have
   different RDs.  Additionally, SFCRs from different VPNs (i.e., in
   different service function overlay networks) must have different RDs,
   and those RDs must be different from any non-VPN SFCRs.

   The Service Path Identifier is defined in [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh] and is
   the value to be placed in the Service Path Identifier field of the
   NSH header of any packet sent on this Service Function Chain.  It is
   expected that one or more Controllers will originate these routes in
   order to configure a service function overlay network.

   The SFC is described in a new BGP Path attribute, the SFC attribute.
   Section 3.2.1 shows the format of that attribute.

3.2.1.  The Service Function Chain Attribute

   [RFC4271] defines the BGP Path Attribute.  This document introduces a
   new Path attribute called the SFC attribute with value TBD3 to be
   assigned by IANA.  The first SFC attribute MUST be processed and
   subsequent instances MUST be ignored.

   The common fields of the SFC attribute are set as follows:

   o  Optional bit is set to 1 to indicate that this is an optional
      attribute.

   o  The Transitive bit is set to 1 to indicate that this is a
      transitive attribute.

   o  The Extended Length bit is set according to the length of the SFC
      attribute as defined in [RFC4271].

   o  The Attribute Type Code is set to TBD3.

   The content of the SFC attribute is a series of Type-Length-Variable
   (TLV) constructs.  Each TLV may include sub-TLVs.  All TLVs and sub-
   TLVs have a common format that is:

   o  Type: A single octet indicating the type of the SFC attribute TLV.
      Values are taken from the registry described in Section 10.3.

   o  Length: A two octet field indicating the length of the data
      following the Length field counted in octets.

   o  Value: The contents of the TLV.

Internet-Draft               BGP for NSH SFC                October 2016


   The formats of the TLVs defined in this document are shown in the
   following sections.  The presence rules and meanings are as follows.

   o  The SFC attribute contains a sequence of zero or more Association
      TLVs.  That is, the Association TLV is optional.  Each Association
      TLV provides an association between this SFCR and another SFCR.
      Each associated SFCR is indicated using the RD with which it is
      advertised (we say the SFCR-RD to avoid ambiguity).

   o  The SFC attribute contains a sequence of one or more Hop TLVs.
      Each Hop TLV contains all of the information about a single hop in
      the SFC.

   o  Each Hop TLV contains an SI value and a sequence of one or more
      SFT TLVs.  Each SFT TLV contains an SFI reference for each
      instance of an SF that is allowed at this hop of the SFC for the
      specific SFT.  Each SFI is indicated using the RD with which it is
      advertised (we say the SFIR-RD to avoid ambiguity).

3.2.1.1.  The Association TLV

   The Association TLV is an optional TLV in the SFC attribute.  It may
   be present multiple times.  Each occurrence provides an association
   with another SFC as advertised in another SFCR.  The format of the
   Association TLV is shown in Figure 5


                +--------------------------------------------+
                |  Type = 1 (1 octet)                        |

                |  Associated SPI (3 octets)                 |
                +--------------------------------------------+


                Figure 5: The Format of the Association TLV

   The fields are as follows:

      Type is set to 1 to indicate an Association TLV.

      Length indicates the length in octets of the Association Type and
      Associated SFCR-RD fields.  The value of the Length field is 12.

Internet-Draft               BGP for NSH SFC                October 2016


      The Association Type field indicate the type of association.  The
      values are tracked in an IANA registry (see Section 10.4).  Only
      one value is defined in this document: type 1 indicates
      association of two unidirectional SFCs to form a bidirectional
      SFC.  An SFC attribute SHOULD NOT contain more than one
      Association TLV with Association Type 1: if more than one is
      present, the first one MUST be processed and subsequent instances
      MUST be ignored.  Note that documents that define new Association
      Types must also define the presence rules for Association TLVs of
      the new type.

      The Associated SFCR-RD contains the RD of some other SFCR
      advertisement that contains the SFC with which this SFC is
      associated.

      The Associated SPI contains the SPI of the associated SFC as
      advertised in the SFCR indicated by the Associated SFCR-RD field.

   Association TLVs with unknown Association Type values SHOULD be
   ignored.  Association TLVs that contain an Associated SFCR-RD value
   equal to the RD of the SFCR in which they are contained SHOULD be
   ignored.  If the Associated SPI is not equal to the SPI advertised in
   the SFCR indicated by the Associated SFCR-RD then the Association TLV
   SHOULD be ignored.

   Note that when two SFCRs reference each other using the Association
   TLV one SFCR advertisement will be received before the other.
   Therefore processing of an association MUST NOT be rejected simply
   because the Associated SFCR-RD is unknown.

   Further discussion of correlation of SFCRs is provided in
   Section 7.2.

3.2.1.2.  The Hop TLV

   There is one Hop TLV in the SFC attribute for each hop in the SFC.
   The format of the Hop TLV is shown in Figure 6.  At least one Hop TLV
   must be present in an SFC attribute.

   The fields are as follows:

      Type is set to 2 to indicate a Hop TLV.

      Length indicates the length in octets of the Service Index and Hop
      Details fields.

      The Service Index is defined in [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh] and is the
      value found in the Service Index field of the NSH header that an
      SFF will use to lookup to which next SFI a packet should be sent.

      The Hop Details consist of a sequence of one or more SFT TLVs.

3.2.1.3.  The SFT TLV

   There is one or more SFT TLV in each Hop TLV.  There is one SFT TLV
   for each SFT supported in the specific hop of the SFC.  The format of
   the SFT TLV is shown in Figure 7.

      Type is set to 3 to indicate an SFT TLV.

      Length indicates the length in octets of the Service Function Type
      and SFIR-RD List fields.

      The Service Function Type is used to identify a Service Function
      Instance Route in the service function overlay network which, in
      turn, will allow lookup of routes to SFIs implementing the SF.
      SFT values in the range 1-31 are Special Purpose SFT values and
      have meanings defined by the documents that describe them - the
      value 'Change Sequence' is defined in Section 6.1 of this
      document.

      The SFIR-RD List is made up of one or more SFIR-RD values from the
      advertisements of SFIs in SFIRs.  An SFIR-RD of value zero has
      special meaning as described in Section 5.  Each entry in the list
      is 8 octets long, and the number of entries in the list can be
      deduced from the value of the Length field.

3.2.2.  General Rules For The Service Function Chain Attribute

   It is possible for the same SFI, as described by an SFIR, to be used
   in multiple SFCRs.

   When two SFCRs have the same SPI but different SFCR-RDs there can be
   three cases:

   o  Two or more Controllers are originating SFCRs for the same SFC.
      In this case the SFC the content of the SFCRs is identical and the
      duplication is to ensure receipt and to provide Controller
      redundancy.

   o  There is a transition in content of the advertised SFC and the
      advertisements may originate from one or more Controllers.  In
      this case the content of the SFCRs will be different.

   o  The reuse of an SPI may result from a configuration error.

   In all cases, there is no way for the receiving SFF to know which
   SFCR to process, and the SFCRs could be received in any order.  At
   any point in time, when two SFCRs have the same SPI but different
   SFCR-RDs, the SFF MUST use the SFCR with the numerically lowest SFCR-
   RD.  The SFF SHOULD log this occurrence to assist with debugging.

   Furthermore, a Controller that wants to change the content of an SFC
   is RECOMMENDED to use a new SPI and so create a new chain onto which
   the Classifiers can transition packet flows before the SFCR for the

   old SFC is withdrawn.  This avoids any race conditions with SFCR
   advertisements.

   Additionally, a Controller SHOULD NOT re-use an SPI after it has
   withdrawn the SFCR that used it until at least a configurable amount
   of time has passed.  This timer SHOULD have a default of one hour.

4.  Mode of Operation

   This document describes the use of BGP as a control plane to create
   and manage a service function overlay network.

4.1.  Route Targets

   The main feature introduced by this document is the ability to create
   multiple service function overlay networks through the use of Route
   Targets (RTs) [RFC4364].

   Every BGP UPDATE containing an SFIR or SFCR carries one or more RTs.
   The RT carried by a particular SFIR or SFCR is determined by the
   provisioning of the route's originator.

   Every node in a service function overlay network is configured with
   one or more import RTs.  Thus, each SFF will import only the SFCRs
   with matching RTs allowing the construction of multiple service
   function overlay networks or instantiate Service Function Chains
   within an L3VPN or EVPN instance (see Section 7.3).  An SFF that has
   a presence in multiple service function overlay networks (i.e.,
   imports more than one RT) may find it helpful to maintain separate
   forwarding state for each overlay network.

4.2.  Service Function Instance Routes

   The SFIR (see Section 3.1) is used to advertise the existence and
   location of a specific Service Function Instance and consists of:

   o  The RT as just described.

   o  A Service Function Type (SFT) that is the category of Service
      Function that is provided (such as "firewall").

   o  A Route Distinguisher (RD) that is unique to a specific instance
      of a service function.

Internet-Draft               BGP for NSH SFC                October 2016


4.3.  Service Function Chain Routes

   The SFCR (see Section 3.2) describes a specific Service Function
   Chain.  The SFCR contains the Service Path Identifier (SPI) used to
   identify the SFC in the NSH in the data plane.  It also contains a
   sequence of Service Indexes (SIs).  Each SI identifies a hop in the
   SFC, and each hop is a choice between one of more SFIs.

   As described in this document, each Service Function Chain Route is
   identified in the service function overlay network by an RD and an
   SPI.  The SPI is unique across all service function overlay networks
   supported by the underlay network.

   The SFCR advertisement comprises:

   o  An RT as described in Section 4.1.

   o  A tuple that identifies the SFCR

      *  An RD that identifies an advertisement of an SFCR.

      *  The SPI that uniquely identifies this chain within all service
         function overlay networks supported by the underlay network.
         This SPI also appears in the NSH.

   o  A series of Service Indexes.  Each SI is used in the context of a
      particular SPI and identifies one or more SFs (distinguished by
      their SFTs) and for each SF a set of SFIs that instantiate the SF.
      The values of the SI indicate the order in which the SFs are to be
      executed in the SFC that is represented by the SPI.

   o  The SI is used in the NSH to identify the entries in the SFC.
      Note that the SI values have meaning only relative to a specific
      chain.  They have no semantic other than to indicate the order of
      Service Functions within the chain and are assumed to be
      monotonically decreasing from the start to the end of the chain
      [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh].

   o  Each Service Index is associated with a set of one or more Service
      Function Instances that can be used to provide the indexed Service
      Function within the chain.  Each member of the set comprises:

      *  The RD used in an SFIR advertisement of the SFI.

      *  The SFT that indicates the type of function as used in the same
         SFIR advertisement of the SFI.

Internet-Draft               BGP for NSH SFC                October 2016


   This may be summarized as follows where the notations "SFCR-RD" and
   "SFIR-RD" are used to distinguish the two different RDs:

      RT, {SFCR-RD, SPI}, m * {SI, {n * {SFT, p * SFIR-RD} } }

   Where:

      RT: Route Target

      SFCR-RD: The Route Descriptor of the Service Function Chain Route
      advertisement

      SPI: Service Path Identifier used in the NSH

      m: The number of hops in the Service Function Chain

      n: The number of choices of Service Function Type for a specific
      hop

      p: The number of choices of Service Function Instance for given
      Service Function Type in a specific hop

      SI: Service Index used in the NSH to indicate a specific hop

      SFT: The Service Function Type used in the same advertisement of
      the Service Function Instance Route

      SFIR-RD: The Route Descriptor used in an advertisement of the
      Service Function Instance Route

   Note that the values of SI are from the set {255, ..., 1} and are
   monotonically decreasing within the SFC.  SIs MUST appear in order
   within the SFCR (i.e., monotonically decreasing) and MUST NOT appear
   more than once.  Malformed SFCRs MUST be discarded and MUST cause any
   previous instance of the SFCR (same SFCR-RD and SPI) to be discarded.

   The choice of SFI is explained further in Section 5.  Note that an
   SFIR-RD value of zero has special meaning as described in that
   Section.

4.4.  Classifier Operation

   As shown in Figure 1, the Classifier is a special Service Function
   that is used to assign packets to an SFC.

   The Classifier is responsible for determining to which packet flow a
   packet belongs (usually by inspecting the packet header), imposing an




Farrel, et al.           Expires April 17, 2017                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft               BGP for NSH SFC                October 2016


   NSH, and initializing the NSH to include the SPI of the selected SFCR
   and to include the SI from first hop of the selected SFC.

   The Classifier may also provide an entropy indicator as described in
   Section 7.1.

4.5.  Service Function Forwarder Operation

   Each packet sent to an SFF is transmitted encapsulated in an NSH.
   The NSH includes an SPI and SI: the SPI indicates the SFCR
   advertisement that announced the Service Function Chain; the tuple
   SPI/SI indicates a specific hop in a specific chain and maps to the
   RD/SFT of a particular SFIR advertisement.

   When an SFF gets an SFCR advertisement it will first determine
   whether to import the route by examining the RT.  If the SFCR is
   imported the SFF then determines whether it is on the SFC by looking
   for its own SFIR-RDs in the SFCR.  If it is on the SFC, the SFF
   creates forwarding state for incoming packets and forwarding state
   for outgoing packets that have been processed by an SFI.

   The SFF creates local forwarding state making the association between
   the SPI/SI and a specific SFI as identified by its SFIR-RD/SFT.

   The SFF also creates next hop forwarding state for packets received
   back from the local SFI that need to be forwarded to the next hop in
   the SFC.  There may be a choice of next hops as described in
   Section 4.3.  The SFF could install forwarding state for all
   potential next hops, or could make choices and only install
   forwarding state to a subset of the potential next hops.  If a choice
   is made then it will be as described in Section 5.

   The installed forwarding state may change over time reacting to
   changes in the underlay network and the availability of particular
   SFIs.

   Note that SFFs only create and store forwarding state for the SFCs on
   which they are included.  They do not retain state for all SFCs
   advertised.

   This selection of forwarding state includes determining from the SFCR
   what SI to put in the NSH of the outbound packet.  This selection may
   be conditional on information returned from the local SFI.

   An SFF may also install forwarding state to support looping, jumping,
   and branching.  The protocol mechanism for explicit control of
   looping, jumping, and branching is described in Section 6.1 using a
   special value of the SFT within an entry in an SFCR.

5.  Selection in Service Function Chains

   As described in Section 2 the SI in the NSH passed back from an SFI
   to the SFF may leave the SFF with a choice of next hop SFTs, and SFIs
   for each SFT.  That is, the SI indicates a set of one or more entries
   in the SFCR each of which comprises an SFT and the RD of an SFIR that
   advertised a specific SFI.  The SFF must choose one of these,
   identify the SFF that supports the chosen SFI, and send the packet to
   that next hop SFF.

   In the typical case, the SFF chooses a next hop SFF by looking at the
   set of all SFFs that support the SFs identified by the SI (that set
   having been advertised in individual SFIR advertisements), finding
   the one or more that are "nearest" in the underlay network, and
   choosing between next hop SFFs using its own load-balancing
   algorithm.

   An SFI may influence this choice process by passing additional
   information back along with the packet and NSH.  This information may
   influence local policy at the SFF to cause it to favor a next hop SFF
   (perhaps selecting one that is not nearest in the underlay), or to
   influence the load-balancing algorithm.

   This selection applies to the normal case, but also applies in the
   case of looping, jumping, and branching (see Section 6).

   Suppose an SFF in a particular service overlay network (identified by
   a particular import RT, RT-z) needs to forward an NSH-encapsulated
   packet whose SPI is SPI-x and whose SI is SI-y.  It does the
   following:

   1.  It looks for an installed SFCR that carries RT-z and that has
       SPI-x in its NLRI.  If there is none, then such packets cannot be
       forwarded.

   2.  From the SFC attribute of that SFCR, it finds the Hop TLV with SI
       value set to SI-y.  If there is no such Hop TLV, then such
       packets cannot be forwarded.

   3.  It then finds the "relevant" set of SFIRs by going through the
       list of of SFT TLVs contained in the Hop TLV as follows:

       A.  An SFIR is relevant if it carries RT-z, the SFT in its NLRI
           matches the SFT value in one of the SFT TLVs, and the RD
           value in its NLRI matches an entry in the list of SFIR-RDs in
           that SFT TLV.

Internet-Draft               BGP for NSH SFC                October 2016


       B.  If an entry in the SFIR-RD list of an SFT TLV contains the
           value zero, then an SFIR is relevant if it carries RT-z and
           the SFT in its NLRI matches the SFT value in that SFT TLV.
           I.e., any SFIR in the service function overlay network
           defined by RT-z and with the correct SFT is relevant.

   Each of the relevant SFIRs identifies a single SFI, and contains a
   Tunnel Encapsulation attribute that specifies how to send a packet to
   that SFI.  For a particular packet, the SFF chooses a particular SFI
   from the set of relevant SFIRs.  This choice is made according to
   local policy.

   A typical policy might be to figure out the set of SFIs that are
   closest, and to load balance among them.  But this is not the only
   possible policy.

6.  Looping, Jumping, and Branching

   As described in Section 2 an SFI or an SFF may cause a packets to
   "loop back" to a previous SF on a chain in order that a sequence of
   functions may be re-executed.  This is simply achieved by replacing
   the SI in the NSH with a higher value instead of decreasing it as
   would normally be the case to determine the next hop in the chain.

   Section 2 also describes how an SFI or an SFF may cause a packets to
   "jump forward" to an SF on a chain that is not the immediate next SF
   in the SFC.  This is simply achieved by replacing the SI in the NSH
   with a lower value than would be achieved by decreasing it by the
   normal amount.

   A more complex option to move packets from one SFC to another is
   described in [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh] and Section 2 where it is termed
   "branching".  This mechanism allows an SFI or SFF to make a choice of
   downstream treatments for packets based on local policy and output of
   the local SF.  Branching is achieved by changing the SPI in the NSH
   to indicate the new chain and setting the SI to indicate the point in
   the chain at which the packets should enter.

   Note that the NSH does not include a marker to indicate whether a
   specific packet has been around a loop before.  Therefore, the use of
   NSH metadata may be required in order to prevent infinite loops.

6.1.  Protocol Control of Looping, Jumping, and Branching

   If the SFT value in an SFT TLV in an SFCR has the Special Purpose SFT
   value "Change Sequence" (see Section 10) then this is an indication
   that the SFF may make a loop, jump, or branch according to local
   policy and information returned by the local SFI.



Farrel, et al.           Expires April 17, 2017                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft               BGP for NSH SFC                October 2016


   In this case, the SPI and SI of the next hop is encoded in the eight
   bytes of an entry in the SFIR-RD list as follows:

      3 bytes SPI

      2 bytes SI

      3 bytes Reserved (SHOULD be set to zero and ignored)

   If the SI in this encoding is not part of the SFCR indicated by the
   SPI in this encoding, then this is an explicit error that SHOULD be
   detected by the SFF when it parses the SFCR.  The SFCR SHOULD NOT
   cause any forwarding state to be installed in the SFF and packets
   received with the SPI that indicates this SFCR SHOULD be silently
   discarded.

   If the SPI in this encoding is unknown, the SFF SHOULD NOT install
   any forwarding state for this SFCR, but MAY hold the SFCR pending
   receipt of another SFCR that does use the encoded SPI.

   If the SPI matches the current SPI for the chain, this is a loop or
   jump.  In this case, if the SI is greater than to the current SI it
   is a loop.  If the SPI matches and the SI is less than the next SI,
   it is a jump.

   If the SPI indicates anther chain, this is a branch and the SI
   indicates the point at which to enter that chain.

   The Change Sequence SFT is just another SFT that may appear in a set
   of SFI/SFT tuples within an SI and is selected as described in
   Section 5.

   Note that Special Purpose SFTs MUST NOT be advertised in SFIRs.

6.2.  Implications for Forwarding State

   Support for looping and jumping requires that the SFF has forwarding
   state established to an SFF that provides access to an instance of
   the appropriate SF.  This means that the SFF must have seen the
   relevant SFIR advertisements and known that it needed to create the
   forwarding state.  This is a matter of local configuration and
   implementation: for example, an implementation could be configured to
   install forwarding state for specific looping/jumping.

   Support for branching requires that the SFF has forwarding state
   established to an SFF that provides access to an instance of the
   appropriate entry SF on the other SFC.  This means that the SFF must
   have seen the relevant SFIR and SFCR advertisements and known that it

Internet-Draft               BGP for NSH SFC                October 2016


   needed to create the forwarding state.  This is a matter of local
   configuration and implementation: for example, an implementation
   could be configured to install forwarding state for specific
   branching (identified by SPI and SI).

7.  Advanced Topics

   This section highlights several advanced topics introduced elsewhere
   in this document.

7.1.  Preserving Entropy

   Forwarding decisions in the underlay network in the presence of equal
   cost multipath (ECMP) are usually made by inspecting key invariant
   fields in a packet header so that all packets from the same packet
   flow receive the same forwarding treatment.  However, when an NSH is
   included in a packet, those key fields may be inaccessible.  For
   example, the fields may be too far inside the packet for a forwarding
   engine to quickly find them and extract their values, or the node
   performing the examination may be unaware of the format and meaning
   of the NSH and so unable to parse far enough into the packet.

   Various mechanisms exist within forwarding technologies to include an
   "entropy indicator" within a forwarded packet.  For example, in MPLS
   there is the entropy label [RFC6790], while for encapsulations in UDP
   the source port field is often used to carry an entropy indicator
   (such as for MPLS in UDP [RFC7510]).

   Implementations of this specification are RECOMMENDED to include an
   entropy indicator within the packet's underlay network header, and
   SHOULD preserve any entropy indicator from a received packet for use
   on the same packet when it is forwarded along the chain but MAY
   choose to generate a new entropy indicator so long as the method used
   is constant for all packets.  Note that preserving per packet entropy
   may require that the entropy indicator is passed to and returned by
   the SFI to prevent the SFF from having to maintain per-packet state.

7.2.  Correlating Service Function Chain Instances

   It is often useful to create bidirectional SFCs to enable packet
   flows to traverse the same set of SFs, but in the reverse order.
   However, packets on SFCs in the data plane (per [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh])
   do not contain a direction indicator, so each direction must use a
   different SPI.

   As described in Section 3.2.1.1 an SFCR can contain one or more
   correlators encoded in Association TLVs.  If the Association Type
   indicates "Bidirectional SFC" then the SFC advertised in the SFCR is



Farrel, et al.           Expires April 17, 2017                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft               BGP for NSH SFC                October 2016


   one direction of a bidirectional pair of SFCs where the other in the
   pair is advertised in the SFCR with RD as carried in the Associated
   SFCR-RD field of the Association TLV.  The SPI carried in the
   Associated SPI field of the Association TLV provides a cross-check
   and should match the SPI advertised in the SFCR with RD as carried in
   the Associated SFCR-RD field of the Association TLV.

   As noted in Section 3.2.1.1 SFCRs reference each other one SFCR
   advertisement will be received before the other.  Therefore
   processing of an association will require that the first SFCR is not
   rejected simply because the Associated SFCR-RD it carries is unknown.
   However, the SFC defined by the first SFCR is valid and SHOULD be
   available for use as a unidirectional SFC even in the absence of an
   advertisement of its partner.

   Furthermore, in error cases where SFCR-a associates with SFCR-b, but
   SFCR-b associates with SFCR-c such that a bidirectional pair of SFCs
   cannot be formed, the individual SFCs are still valid and SHOULD be
   available for use as unidirectional SFCs.  An implementation SHOULD
   log this situation because it represents a Controller error.

   Usage of a bidirectional SFC may be programmed into the Classifiers
   by the Controller.  Alternatively, a Classifier may look at incoming
   packets on a bidirectional packet flow, extract the SPI from the
   received NSH, and look up the SFCR to find the reverse direction SFC
   to use when it sends packets.

   See Section 8 for an example of how this works.

7.3.  VPN Considerations and Private Service Functions

   Likely deployments include reserving specific instances of Service
   Functions for specific customers or allowing customers to deploy
   their own Service Functions within the network.  Building Service
   Functions in such environments requires that suitable identifiers are
   used to ensure that SFFs distinguish which SFIs can be used and which
   cannot.

   This problem is similar to how VPNs are supported and is solved in a
   similar way.  The RT field is used to indicate a set of Service
   Functions from which all choices must be made.

8.  Examples

   Assume we have a service function overlay network with four SFFs
   (SFF1, SFF3, SFF3, and SFF4).  The SFFs have addresses in the
   underlay network as follows:




Farrel, et al.           Expires April 17, 2017                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft               BGP for NSH SFC                October 2016


      SFF1 192.0.2.1
      SFF2 192.0.2.2
      SFF3 192.0.2.3
      SFF4 192.0.2.4


   Each SFF provides access to some SFIs from the four Service Function
   Types SFT=41, SFT=42, SFT=43, and SFT=44 as follows:


      SFF1 SFT=41 and SFT=42
      SFF2 SFT=41 and SFT=43
      SFF3 SFT=42 and SFT=44
      SFF4 SFT=43 and SFT=44


   The service function network also contains a Controller with address
   198.51.100.1.

   This example service function overlay network is shown in Figure 8.

   The SFFs advertise routes to the SFIs they support.  So we see the
   following SFIRs:


      RD = 192.0.2.1,1, SFT = 41
      RD = 192.0.2.1,2, SFT = 42
      RD = 192.0.2.2,1, SFT = 41
      RD = 192.0.2.2,2, SFT = 43
      RD = 192.0.2.3,7, SFT = 42
      RD = 192.0.2.3,8, SFT = 44
      RD = 192.0.2.4,5, SFT = 43
      RD = 192.0.2.4,6, SFT = 44


   Note that the addressing used for communicating between SFFs is taken
   from the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute of the SFIR and not from the
   SFIR-RD.

8.1.  Example Explicit SFC With No Choices

   Consider the following SFCR.


      SFC1:  RD = 198.51.100.1,101, SPI = 15,
             [SI = 255, SFT = 41, RD = 192.0.2.1,1],
             [SI = 250, SFT = 43, RD = 192.0.2.2,2]


   The Service Function Chain consists of an SF of type 41 located at
   SFF1 followed by an SF of type 43 located at SFF2.  This chain is
   fully explicit and each SFF is offered no choice in forwarding packet
   along the chain.

   SFF1 will receive packets on the chain from the Classifier and will
   identify the chain from the SPI (15).  The initial SI will be 255 and
   so SFF1 will deliver the packets to the SFI for SFT 41.

   When the packets are returned to SFF1 by the SFI the SI will be
   decreased to 250 for the next hop.  SFF1 has no flexibility in the
   choice of SFF to support the next hop SFI and will forward the packet
   to SFF2 which will send the packets to the SFI that supports SFT 43
   before forwarding the packets to their destinations.

8.2.  Example SFC With Choice of SFIs







Farrel, et al.           Expires April 17, 2017                [Page 26]

Internet-Draft               BGP for NSH SFC                October 2016


      SFC2:  RD = 198.51.100.1,102, SPI = 16,
             [SI = 255, SFT = 41, RD = 192.0.2.1,],
             [SI = 250, SFT = 43, {RD = 192.0.2.2,2,
                                   RD = 192.0.2.4,5 } ]


   In this example the chain also consists of an SF of type 41 located
   at SFF1 and this is followed by an SF of type 43, but in this case
   the SI = 250 contains a choice between the SFI located at SFF2 and
   the SFI located at SFF4.

   SFF1 will receive packets on the chain from the Classifier and will
   identify the chain from the SPI (16).  The initial SI will be 255 and
   so SFF1 will deliver the packets to the SFI for SFT 41.

   When the packets are returned to SFF1 by the SFI the SI will be
   decreased to 250 for the next hop.  SFF1 now has a choice of next hop
   SFF to execute the next hop in the chain.  It can either forward
   packets to SFF2 or SFF4 to execute a function of type 43.  It uses
   its local load balancing algorithm to make this choice.  The chosen
   SFF will send the packets to the SFI that supports SFT 43 before
   forwarding the packets to their destinations.

8.3.  Example SFC With Open Choice of SFIs


      SFC3:  RD = 198.51.100.1,103, SPI = 17,
             [SI = 255, SFT = 41, RD = 192.0.2.1,1],
             [SI = 250, SFT = 44, RD = 0]


   In this example the chain also consists of an SF of type 41 located
   at SFF1 and this is followed by an SI with an RD of zero and SF of
   type 44.  This means that a choice can be h made between any SFF that
   supports an SFI of type 44.

   SFF1 will receive packets on the chain from the Classifier and will
   identify the chain from the SPI (17).  The initial SI will be 255 and
   so SFF1 will deliver the packets to the SFI for SFT 41.

   When the packets are returned to SFF1 by the SFI the SI will be
   decreased to 250 for the next hop.  SFF1 now has a free choice of
   next hop SFF to execute the next hop in the chain selecting between
   all SFFs that support SFs of type 44.  Looking at the SFIRs it has
   received, SFF1 knows that SF type 44 is supported by SFF3 and SFF4.
   SFF1 uses its local load balancing algorithm to make this choice.
   The chosen SFF will send the packets to the SFI that supports SFT 44
   before forwarding the packets to their destinations.

8.4.  Example SFC With Choice of SFTs


      SFC4:  RD = 198.51.100.1,104, SPI = 18,
             [SI = 255, SFT = 41, RD = 192.0.2.1,1],
             [SI = 250, {SFT = 43, RD = 192.0.2.2,2,
                         SFT = 44, RD = 192.0.2.3,8 } ]


   This example provides a choice of SF type in the second hop in the
   chain.  The SI of 250 indicates a choice between SF type 43 located
   through SF2 and SF type 44 located at SF3.

   SFF1 will receive packets on the chain from the Classifier and will
   identify the chain from the SPI (18).  The initial SI will be 255 and
   so SFF1 will deliver the packets to the SFI for SFT 41.

   When the packets are returned to SFF1 by the SFI the SI will be
   decreased to 250 for the next hop.  SFF1 now has a free choice of
   next hop SFF to execute the next hop in the chain selecting between
   all SFF2 that support an SF of type 43 and SFF3 that supports an SF
   of type 44.  These may be completely different functions that are to
   be executed dependent on specific conditions, or may be similar
   functions identified with different type identifiers (such as
   firewalls from different vendors).  SFF1 uses its local policy and
   load balancing algorithm to make this choice, and may use additional
   information passed back from the local SFI to help inform its
   selection.  The chosen SFF will send the packets to the SFI that
   supports the chose SFT before forwarding the packets to their
   destinations.

8.5.  Example Correlated Bidirectional SFCs


     SFC5:  RD = 198.51.100.1,105, SPI = 19,
            Assoc-Type = 1, Assoc-RD = 198.51.100.1,106, Assoc-SPI = 20,
            [SI = 255, SFT = 41, RD = 192.0.2.1,1],
            [SI = 250, SFT = 43, RD = 192.0.2.2,2]

     SFC6:  RD = 198.51.100.1,106, SPI = 20,
            Assoc-Type = 1, Assoc-RD = 198.51.100.1,105, Assoc-SPI = 19,
            [SI = 254, SFT = 43, RD = 192.0.2.2,2],
            [SI = 249, SFT = 41, RD = 192.0.2.1,1]


   This example demonstrates correlation of two SFCs to form a
   bidirectional SFC as described in Section 7.2.

   Two SFCRs are advertised by the Controller.  They have different SPIs
   (19 and 20) so they are known to be separate SFCs, but they both have
   Association TLVs with Association Type set to 1 indicating
   bidirectional SFCs.  Each has an Associated SFCR-RD fields containing
   the value of the other SFCR-RD to correlated the two SCFs as a
   bidirectional pair.

   As can be seen from the SFCRs in this example, the chains are
   symmetric: the hops in SFC5 appear in the reverse order in SFC6.

8.6.  Example Correlated Asymmetrical Bidirectional SFCs


     SFC7:  RD = 198.51.100.1,107, SPI = 21,

            [SI = 254, SFT = 44, RD = 192.0.2.4,6],
            [SI = 249, SFT = 41, RD = 192.0.2.1,1]


   Asymmetric bidirectional SFCs can also be created.  This example
   shows a pair of SFCs with distinct SPIs (21 and 22) that are
   correlated in the same way as in the example in Section 8.5.

   However, unlike in that example, the SFCs are different in each
   direction.  Both chains include a hop of SF type 41, but SFC7
   includes a hop of SF type 43 supported at SFF2 while SFC8 includes a
   hop of SF type 44 supported at SFF4.

8.7.  Example Looping in an SFC


      SFC9:  RD = 198.51.100.1,109, SPI = 23,
             [SI = 255, SFT = 41, RD = 192.0.2.1,1],
             [SI = 250, SFT = 44, RD = 192.0.2.4,5],
             [SI = 245, SFT = 1, RD = {SPI=23, SI=255, Rsv=0}],
             [SI = 245, SFT = 42, RD = 192.0.2.3,7]


   Looping and jumping are described in Section 6.  This example shows
   an SFC that contains an explicit loop-back instruction that is
   presented as a choice within an SFC hop.

Internet-Draft               BGP for NSH SFC                October 2016


   The first two hops in the chain (SI = 255 and SI = 250) are normal.
   That is, the packets will be delivered to SFF1 and SFF4 in turn for
   execution of SFs of type 41 and 44 respectively.

   The third hop (SI = 245) presents SFF4 with a choice of next hop.  It
   can either forward the packets to SFF3 for an SF of type 42 (the
   second choice), or it can loop back.

   The loop-back entry in the SFCR for SI = 245 is indicated by the
   special purpose SFT value 1 ("Change Sequence").  Within this hop,
   the RD is interpreted as encoding the SPI and SI of the next hop (see
   Section 6.1.  In this case the SPI is 23 which indicates that this is
   loop or branch: i.e., the next hop is on the same SFC.  The SI is set
   to 255: this is a higher number than the current SI (245) indicating
   a loop.

   SFF4 must make a choice between these two next hops.  Either the
   packets will be forwarded to SFF3 with the NSH SI decreased to 245 or
   looped back to SFF1 with the NSH SI reset to 255.  This choice will
   be made according to local policy, information passed back by the
   local SFI, and details in the packets' metadata that are used to
   prevent infinite looping.

8.8.  Example Branching in an SFC


      SFC10:  RD = 198.51.100.1,110, SPI = 24,
             [SI = 254, SFT = 42, RD = 192.0.2.3,7],
             [SI = 249, SFT = 43, RD = 192.0.2.2,2]

      SFC11:  RD = 198.51.100.1,111, SPI = 25,
             [SI = 255, SFT = 41, RD = 192.0.2.1,1],
             [SI = 250, SFT = 1, RD = {SPI=24, SI=254, Rsv=0}]


   Branching follows a similar procedure to that for looping (and
   jumping) as shown in Section 8.7 however there are two SFCs involved.

   SFC10 shows a normal chain with packets forwarded to SFF3 and SFF2
   for execution of service functions of type 42 and 43 respectively.

   SFC11 starts as normal (SFF1 for an SF of type 41), but then SFF1
   processes the next hop in the chain and finds a "Change Sequence"
   Special Purpose SFT.  The SFIR-RD field includes an SPI of 24 which
   indicates SFC10, not the current SFC.  The SI in the SFIR-RD is 254,
   so SFF1 knows that it must set the SPI/SI in the NSH to 24/254 and
   send the packets to the appropriate SFF as advertised in the SFCR for
   SFC10 (that is, SFF3).

9.  Security Considerations

   This document inherits all the security considerations discussed in
   the documents that specify BGP, the documents that specify BGP
   Multiprotocol Extensions, and the documents that define the
   attributes that are carried by BGP UPDATEs of the SFC AFI/SAFI.  For
   more information look in [RFC4271], [RFC4760], and
   [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps].

   Service Function Chaining provides a significant attack opportunity:
   packets can be diverted from their normal paths through the network,
   can be made to execute unexpected functions, and the functions that
   are instantiated in software can be subverted.  However, this
   specification does not change the existence of Service Function
   Chaining and security issues specific to Service Function Chaining
   are covered in [RFC7665] and [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh].

   This document defines a control plane for Service Function Chaining.
   Clearly, this provides an attack vector for a Service Function
   Chaining system as an attack on this control plane could be used to
   make the system misbehave.  Thus, the security of the BGP system is
   critically important to the security of the whole Service Function
   Chaining system.

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  New BGP AF/SAFI

   IANA maintains a registry of "Address Family Numbers".  IANA is
   requested to assign a new Address Family Number from the "Standards
   Action" range called "BGP SFC" (TBD1 in this document) with this
   document as a reference.

   IANA maintains a registry of "Subsequent Address Family Identifiers
   (SAFI) Parameters".  IANA is requested to assign a new SAFI value
   from the "Standards Action" range called "BGP SFC" (TBD2 in this
   document) with this document as a reference.

10.2.  New BGP Path Attribute

   IANA maintains a registry of "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   Parameters" with a subregistry of "BGP Path Attributes".  IANA is
   requested to assign a new Path attribute called "SFC attribute" (TBD3
   in this document) with this document as a reference.

10.3.  New SFC Attribute TLVs Type Registry

   IANA maintains a registry of "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   Parameters".  IANA is request to create a new subregistry called the
   "SFC Attribute TLVs" registry.

   Valid values are in the range 0 to 65535.

   o  Values 0 and 65535 are to be marked "Reserved, not to be
      allocated".

   o  Values 1 through 65524 are to be assigned according to the "First
      Come First Served" policy [RFC5226].

   This document should be given as a reference for this registry.

   The new registry should track:

   o  Type

   o  Name

   o  Reference Document or Contact

   o  Registration Date

   The registry should initially be populated as follows:


       Type  | Name                  | Reference     | Date
       ------+-----------------------+---------------+---------------
       1     | Association TLV       | [This.I-D]    | Date-to-be-set
       2     | Hop TLV               | [This.I-D]    | Date-to-be-set
       3     | SFT TLV               | [This.I-D]    | Date-to-be-set


10.4.  New SFC Association Type Registry

   IANA maintains a registry of "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   Parameters".  IANA is request to create a new subregistry called the
   "SFC Association Type" registry.

   Valid values are in the range 0 to 65535.

   o  Values 0 and 65535 are to be marked "Reserved, not to be
      allocated".

10.5.  New Service Function Type Registry

   IANA is request to create a new top-level registry called "Service
   Function Chaining Service Function Types".

   Valid values are in the range 0 to 65535.

   o  Values 0 and 65535 are to be marked "Reserved, not to be
      allocated".

   o  Values 1 through 31 are to be assigned by "Standards Action"
      [RFC5226] and are referred to as the Special Purpose SFT values.

   o  Other values (32 through 65534) are to be assigned according to
      the "First Come First Served" policy [RFC5226].

   This document should be given as a reference for this registry.

   The new registry should track:

   o  Value

   o  Name

   o  Reference Document or Contact
