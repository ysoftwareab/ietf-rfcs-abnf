   Abstract 
       
      This document specifies a framework for the PSAMP (Packet 
      SAMPling) protocol. The functions of this protocol are to select 
      packets from a stream according to a set of standardized 
      selectors, to form a stream of reports on the selected packets, 
      and to export the reports to a collector. This framework details 
      the components of this architecture, then describes some generic 
      requirements, motivated the dual aims of ubiquitous deployment 
      and utility of the reports for applications. Detailed 
      requirements for selection, reporting and exporting are 
      described, along with configuration requirements of the PSAMP 
      functions. 
    
      Comments on this document should be addressed to the PSAMP 
      Working Group mailing list: psamp@ops.ietf.org

   1. Introduction 
       
      This document describes the PSAMP framework for network elements 
      to select subsets of packets by statistical and other methods, 
      and to export a stream of reports on the selected packets to a 
      collector.  
       
      The motivation for the PSAMP standard comes from the need for 
      measurement-based support for network management and control 
    
   Duffield (Ed.)            Expires April 2005               [Page 3] 
    
   Internet Draft      Packet Selection and Reporting     October 2004 
    
    
      across multivendor domains. This requires domain wide consistency 
      in the types of selection schemes available, the manner in which 
      the resulting measurements are presented, and consequently, 
      consistency of the interpretation that can be put on them. 
       
      The motivation for specific packet selection operations comes 
      from the applications that they enable. Development of the PSAMP 
      standard is open to influence by the requirements of standards in 
      related IETF Working Groups, for example, IP Performance Metrics 
      (IPPM) [RFC-2330] and Internet Traffic Engineering (TEWG).  
       
      The name PSAMP is a contraction of the phrase Packet Sampling. 
      The word "sampling" captures the idea that only a subset of all 
      packets passing a network element will be selected for reporting. 
      But PSAMP selection operations include random selection, 
      deterministic selection (filtering), and deterministic 
      approximations to random selection (hash-based selection). 
       
   2. PSAMP Documents Overview

      document). This document describes the PSAMP framework for 
      network elements to select subsets of packets by statistical and 
      other methods, and to export a stream of reports on the selected 
      packets to a collector. Definitions of terminology and the use of 
      the terms "must", "should" and "may" in this document are 
      informational only.

      Selection", describes the set of packet selection techniques 
      supported by PSAMP.

   3. Elements, Terminology and High-level Architecture 
       
   3.1 High-level description of the PSAMP Architecture 
       
      Here is an informal high level description of the PSAMP protocol 
      operating in a PSAMP device (all terms will be defined 
      presently). A stream of packets is observed at an observation 
      point. A selection process inspects each packet to determine 
      whether it should be selected. A reporting process constructs a 
    
   Duffield (Ed.)            Expires April 2005               [Page 4] 
    
   Internet Draft      Packet Selection and Reporting     October 2004 
    
    
      report on each selected packet, using the packet content, and 
      possibly other information such as the packet treatment or the 
      arrival timestamp. An exporting process sends the reports to a 
      collector, together with any subsidiary information needed for 
      their interpretation.  
    
      The following figure indicates the sequence of the three 
      processes (selection, reporting, and exporting) within the PSAMP 
      device. The composition of the selection process followed by the 
      reporting process is known as the measurement process. 
       
                 +---------+    +---------+    +---------+ 
       Observed  |Selection|    |Reporting|    |Exporting| 
       Packet--->|Process  |--->|Process  |--->|Process  |--->Collector   
       Stream    +---------+    +---------+    +---------+  
               \----Measurement Process-----/                         
    
      The following sections give the detailed definitions of each of 
      all the objects just named. 
    
   3.2 Observation Points, Packet Streams and Packet Content 
       
      This section contains the definition of terms relevant to 
      obtaining the packet input to the selection process.  
       
      * Observation Point  
       
        An observation point is a location in the network where packets 
        can be observed. Examples include: 
         
             (i) a line to which a probe is attached; 
             (ii) a shared medium, such as an Ethernet-based LAN; 
             (iii) a single port of a router, or set of interfaces 
             (physical or logical) of a router; 
             (iv) an embedded measurement subsystem within an 
        interface. 
              
        Note that one Observation Point may be a superset of several 
        other Observation Points.  For example one Observation Point 
        can be an entire line card.  This would be the superset of the 
        individual Observation Points at the line card's interfaces. 
       
      * Observed Packet Stream 
         
        The observed packet stream is the set of all packets observed 
        at the Observation Point. 
       
      * Packet Stream 
    
        A packet stream denotes a subset of the Observed Packet Stream 
        that flows past some specified point within the measurement 

    
   Duffield (Ed.)            Expires April 2005               [Page 5] 
    
   Internet Draft      Packet Selection and Reporting     October 2004 
    
    
        process. An example of a Packet Stream is the output of the 
        selection process.  
         
         
      * Packet Content 
       
        The packet content denotes the union of the packet header 
        (which includes link layer, network layer and other 
        encapsulation headers) and the packet payload. 
       
      Note that packets selected from a Packet Stream, e.g. by 
      sampling, do not necessarily possess a property by which they can 
      be distinguished from packets that have not been selected. For 
      this reason the term "stream" is favored over "flow", which is 
      defined as set of packets with common properties [IPFIX-REQUIRE]. 
       
   3.3 Selection Process 
       
      This section defines the selection process and related objects. 
       
      * Selection Process 
         
        A selection process takes the Observed Packet Stream as its 
        input and selects a subset of that stream as its output. 
         
      * Selection State:  
       
           A Selection Process may maintain state information for use 
           by the Selection Process and/or the Reporting Process. At a 
           given time, the Selection State may depend on packets 
           observed at and before that time, and other variables. 
           Examples include: 
             
                  (i) sequence numbers of packets at the input of 
                  selectors; 
                   
                  (ii) a timestamp of observation of the packet at the 
                  Observation Point; 
                   
                  (iii) iterators for pseudorandom number generators; 
                
                  (iv) hash values calculated during selection; 
             
                  (v) indicators of whether the packet was selected by 
                  a given selector; 
                   
           Selection Processes may change portions of the Selection 
           State as a result of processing a packet. Selection State 
           for a packet is to reflect the state after processing the 
           packet. 
            
      * Selector:  
    
   Duffield (Ed.)            Expires April 2005               [Page 6] 
    
   Internet Draft      Packet Selection and Reporting     October 2004 
    
    
       
           A selector defines the action of a Selection Process on a 
           single packet of its input. If selected, the packet becomes 
           an element of the output Packet Stream from the selector.  
            
           The Selector can make use of the following information in 
           determining whether a packet is selected: 
            
           (i) the packet's content; 
       
           (ii) information derived from the packet's treatment at the     
           Observation Point; 
       
           (iii) any Selection State that may be maintained by the 
           Selection Process. 
            
    
      * Composite Selector:  
         
        A composite selector is an ordered composition of Selectors, in 
        which the output Packet Stream issuing from one Selector forms 
        the input Packet Stream to the succeeding Selector. 
            
      * Primitive Selector:  
       
           A Selector is primitive if it is not a Composite Selector. 
               
            
   3.4 Reporting Process 
       
      * Reporting Process:  
       
           A reporting process creates a report stream from the packets 
           selected by a Selection Process, in preparation for export. 
           The input to the Reporting Process comprises that 
           information available to the Selection Process per selected 
           packet, specifically: 
            
             (i) the selected packet's content; 
              
             (ii) information derived from the selected packet's 
             treatment at the Observation Point; 
              
             (iii) any Selection State maintained by the inputting 
             Selection Process, reflecting any modifications to the 
             Selection State made during selection of the packet. 
              
      * Report Stream: 
            
           The report stream is the output of a reporting process, 
           comprising two distinguished types of information: packet 
           reports, and report interpretation.

   Internet Draft      Packet Selection and Reporting     October 2004 
    
    
            
      * Packet Reports:  
            
           Packet Reports comprise a configurable subset of a packet's 
           input to the Reporting Process, including the packet's 
           content, information relating to its treatment  
           (for example, the output interface), and its associated 
           Selection State (for example, a hash of the packet's 
           content) 
    
      * Report Interpretation:  
            
           Report interpretation comprises subsidiary information, 
           relating to one or more packets, that is used for 
           interpretation of their Packet Reports. Examples include 
           configuration parameters of the Selection Process and of the 
           Reporting Process. 
    
              
   3.5 Measurement Process 
    
      * A Measurement Process is the composition of a Selection Process 
        followed by a Reporting Process. 
       
   3.6 Exporting Process 
       
      * Exporting Process:  
         
        An exporting process sends, in the form of export packet, the 
        output of one or more Measurement Processes to one or more 
        collectors.  
    
      * Export Packets:  
         
        a combination of Report Interpretation and/or one or more 
        Packet Reports are bundled by the Exporting Process into a 
        export packet for exporting to a collector. 
         
   3.7 PSAMP Device 
       
      A PSAMP Device is a device hosting at least an Observation Point, 
      a Measurement Process and an Exporting Process. Typically, 
      corresponding Observation Point(s), Measurement Process(es) and 
      Exporting Process(es) are co-located at this device, for example 
      at a router. 
       
   3.8 Collector 
       
      A collector receives a report stream exported by one or more 
      Exporting Processes. In some cases, the host of the Measurement 
      and/or Exporting Processes may also serve as the collector.

   3.10    PSAMP and IPFIX Interaction 
       
      The PSAMP Measurement Process can be viewed as analogous to the 
      IPFIX metering process. The PSAMP Measurement Process takes an 
      Observed Packet Stream as its input, and produces Packet Reports 
      as its output. The IPFIX metering process produces flow records 
      as its output. The distinct name "Measurement Process" has been 
      retained in order to avoid potential confusion in settings where 
      IPFIX and PSAMP coexist, and in order to avoid the implicit 
      requirement that the PSAMP version satisfy the requirements of an 
      IPFIX metering process (at least while these are under 
      development). The relationship between PSAMP and IPFIX is 
      described more in [PSAMP-INFO].  
    
   4. Generic Requirements for PSAMP 
       
      This section describes the generic requirements for the PSAMP 
      protocol. A number of these are realized as specific requirements 
      in later sections.

   4.1 Generic Selection Process Requirements. 
       
      * Ubiquity: The Selectors must be simple enough to be implemented 
        ubiquitously at maximal line rate. 
       
      * Applicability: the set of Selectors must be rich enough to 
        support a range of existing and emerging measurement based 
        applications and protocols. This requires a workable trade-off 
        between the range of traffic engineering applications and 
        operational tasks it enables, and the complexity of the set of 
        capabilities. 
       
      * Extensibility: the protocol must be able to accommodate 
        additional packet selectors not currently defined. 
       
      * Flexibility: the protocol must support selection of packets 
        using various network protocols or encapsulation layers, 
        including Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) [IPv4], Internet 
        Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) [RFC-2460], and Multiprotocol Label 
        Switching (MPLS) [RFC-3031].  
    
      * Robust Selection: packet selection must be robust against 
        attempts to craft an observed packet stream from which packets 
        are selected disproportionately (e.g. to evade selection, or 
        overload measurement systems). 
    
      * Parallel Measurement Processes: the protocol must support 
        simultaneous operation of multiple independent Measurement 
        Processes at the same host. 
       
      Non-Contingency: the selection decision for each packet must not 
      depend on future observed packets.  
       
      * Encrypted Packets: Selectors that interpret of packet fields 
        must be configurable to ignore (i.e. not select) encrypted 
        packets, when they are detected.  
    
      Specific Selectors are outlined in Section 5, and described in 
      more detail in the companion document [PSAMP-TECH].  
       
   4.2 Generic Reporting Process Requirements 
       
      * Self-defining: the Report Stream must be complete in the sense 
        that no additional information need be retrieved from the 
        Observation Point in order to interpret and analyze the 
        reports.   
       
      * Indication of Information Loss: the Report Stream must include 
        sufficient information to indicate or allow the detection of 
        loss occurring within the Selection, Reporting or Exporting 

    
   Duffield (Ed.)            Expires April 2005              [Page 11] 
    
   Internet Draft      Packet Selection and Reporting     October 2004 
    
    
        Processes, or in transport. This may be achieved by the use of 
        sequence numbers. 
       
      * Accuracy: the Report Stream must include information that 
        enables the accuracy of measurements to be determined. 
       
      * Faithfulness: all reported quantities that relate to the packet 
        treatment must reflect the router state and configuration 
        encountered by the packet at the time it is received by the 
        Measurement Process. 
       
      * Privacy: selection of the content of Packet Reports will be 
        cognizant of privacy and anonymity issues while being 
        responsive to the needs of measurement applications, and in 
        accordance with [RFC-2804].  Full packet capture of arbitrary 
        packet streams is explicitly out of scope. 
    
      A specific Reporting Process meeting these requirements, and the 
      requirement for ubiquity, is described in Section 6. 
       
   4.3 Generic Exporting Process Requirements 
       
      * Timeliness: configuration must allow for limiting of buffering 
        delays for the formation and transmission for Export Packets. 
        See Section 8.3  for further details. 
       
      * Congestion Avoidance: export of a Report Stream across a 
        network must be congestion avoiding in compliance with [RFC-
        2914]. 
       
      * Secure Export: 
              
        (i) confidentiality: the option to encrypt exported data must 
        be provided. 
     
        (ii) integrity: alterations in transit to exported data must be 
        detectable at the Collector 
              
        (iii) authenticity: authenticity of exported data must be 
        verifiable by the Collector in order to detect forged data. 
       
      The motivation here is the same as for security in IPFIX export; 
      see Sections 6.3 and 10 of [IPFIX-REQUIRE].   
       
   4.4 Generic Configuration Requirements 
       
      * Ease of Configuration: of sampling and export parameters, e.g. 
        for automated remote reconfiguration in response to collected 
        reports. 
       
      * Secure Configuration: the option to configure via protocols 
        that prevent unauthorized reconfiguration or eavesdropping on

   Internet Draft      Packet Selection and Reporting     October 2004 
    
    
        configuration communications must be available.  Eavesdropping 
        on configuration might allow an attacker to gain knowledge that 
        would be helpful in crafting a packet stream to evade 
        subversion, or overload the measurement infrastructure. 
    
      Configuration is discussed in Section 9. Feasibility and 
      complexity of PSAMP operations is discussed in Section 10. 
    
   5. Packet Selection 
       
      This section details specific requirements for the Selection 
      Process, motivated by the generic requirements of Section 3.3. 
       
       
   5.1 Two Types of Selector 
    
      PSAMP categorizes selectors into two types: 
       
      * Filtering: a filter is a selector that selects a packet 
        deterministically based on the Packet Content, the packet's 
        treatment, and functions of these occurring in the Selection 
        State. Two examples are: 
       
           (i) Mask/match filtering.  
            
           (ii) Hash-based selection: a hash function is applied to the 
           packet content, and the packet is selected if the result 
           falls in a specified range. 
       
      * Sampling: a selector that is not a filter is called a sampling 
        operation. This reflects the intuitive notion that if the 
        selection of a packet cannot be determined from its content 
        alone, there must be some type of sampling taking place.  
         
        Sampling operations can be divided into two subtypes: 
    
           (i) Content-independent Sampling, which does not use Packet 
           Content in reaching sampling decisions. Examples include 
           periodic sampling, and uniform pseudorandom sampling driven 
           by a pseudorandom number whose generation is independent of 
           packet content. Note that in content-independent sampling it 
           is not necessary to access the Packet Content in order to 
           make the selection decision. 
       
           (ii) Content-dependent Sampling, in which the Packet Content 
           is used in reaching selection decisions. Examples include 
           pseudorandom selection according to a probability that 
           depends on the contents of a packet field; note that this is 
           not a Filter. 
       
   5.2 PSAMP Packet Selectors

   Internet Draft      Packet Selection and Reporting     October 2004 
    
    
       A spectrum of packet selectors is described in detail in [PSAMP-
       TECH]. Here we only briefly summarize the meanings for 
       completeness. 
    
      A PSAMP Selection Process must support at least one of the 
      following Selectors. 
          
      * Systematic Time Based Sampling: packet selection is triggered 
        at periodic instants separated by a time called the spacing. 
        All packets that arrive within a certain time of the trigger 
        (called the interval length) are selected. 
       
      * Systematic Count Based Sampling: similar to systematic time 
        based expect that selection is reckoned with respect to packet 
        count rather than time. Packet selection is triggered 
        periodically by packet count, a number of successive packets 
        being selected subsequent to each trigger. 
       
      * Uniform Probabilistic Sampling: packets are selected 
        independently with fixed sampling probability p. 
       
      * Non-uniform Probabilistic Sampling: packets are selected 
        independently with probability p that depends on packet 
        content. 
       
      * Probabilistic n-out-of-N Sampling: form each count-based 
        successive block of N packets, n are selected at random.  
       
      * Mask/Match Filtering: this entails taking the masking portions 
        of the packet (i.e. taking the logical "and" with a binary 
        mask) and selecting the packet if the result falls in a range 
        specified in the selection parameters of the filter.  This 
        specification does not preclude the future definition of a high 
        level syntax for defining Filtering in a concise way (e.g. TCP 
        port taking a particular value) providing that syntax can be 
        compiled into the bitwise expression. 
         
        Mask/Match operations should be available for different 
        protocol portions of the packet header: 
    
           (i) the IP header (excluding options in IPv4, stacked 
           headers in IPv6) 
            
           (ii) transport header 
            
           (iii) encapsulation headers (e.g. the MPLS label stack, if 
           present) 
         
        When the PSAMP device offers Mask/Match filtering, and, in its 
        usual capacity other than in performing PSAMP functions, 
        identifies or processes information from IP, transport or 
        encapsulation protocols, then the information should be made 
    
   Duffield (Ed.)            Expires April 2005              [Page 14] 
    
   Internet Draft      Packet Selection and Reporting     October 2004 
    
    
        available for filtering. For example, when a PSAMP device 
        routes based on destination IP address, that field should be 
        made available for filtering. Conversely, a PSAMP device that 
        does not route is not expected to be able to locate an IP 
        address within a packet, or make it available for filtering, 
        although it may do so. 
         
        Since packet encryption alters the meaning of encrypted fields, 
        Mask/Match filtering must be configurable to ignore encrypted 
        packets, when detected. 
       
        Hash-based Selection: Hash-based selection will employ one or 
        more hash functions to be standardized.  A hash function is 
        applied to a subset of packet content, and the packet is 
        selected of the resulting hash falls in a specified range. With 
        a suitable hash function, hash based selection approximates 
        uniform random sampling. Applications of hash-based sampling 
        are described in Section 11.  
         
      * Router State Filtering: the Selection Process may support 
        Filtering based on the following conditions, which may be 
        combined with the logical "and", "or" or "not" operators:  
    
           (i) Ingress interface at which packet arrives equals a 
           specified value 
           (ii) Egress interface to which packet is routed to equals a 
           specified value 
           (iii) Packet violated Access Control List (ACL) on the 
           router 
           (iv) Failed Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) 
           (v) Failed Resource Reservation (RSVP) 
           (vi) No route found for the packet 
           (vii) Origin Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System 
           (AS) equals a specified value or lies within a given range 
           (viii) Destination BGP AS equals a specified value or lies 
           within a given range 
    
       Router architectural considerations may preclude some 
       information concerning the packet treatment, e.g. routing state, 
       being available at line rate for selection of packets. However, 
       if selection not based on routing state has reduced down from 
       line rate, subselection based on routing state may be feasible. 
       
    
   5.3 Selection Fraction Terminology 
       
      * Population:  

        A population is a Packet Stream, or a subset of a Packet 
        Stream. A Population can be considered as a base set from which 
        packets are selected. An example is all packets in the Observed 
    
   Duffield (Ed.)            Expires April 2005              [Page 15] 
    
   Internet Draft      Packet Selection and Reporting     October 2004 
    
    
        Packet Stream that are observed within some specified time 
        interval. 
       
      * Population Size:  

        The Population Size is the number of all packets in a 
        Population. 
            
      * Configured Selection Fraction 
         
        The Configured Selection Fraction is the ratio of the number of 
        packets selected by a Selector from an input Population, to the 
        Population Size, as based on the configured selection 
        parameters. 
         
      * Attained Selection Fraction 
         
        The Attained Selection Fraction is the actual ratio of the 
        number of packets selected by a Selector from an input 
        Population, to the Population Size.  
    
      For some sampling methods the Attained Selection Fraction can 
      differ from the Configured Selection Fraction due to, for 
      example, the inherent statistical variability in sampling 
      decisions of probabilistic Sampling and Hash-based Selection. 
      Nevertheless, for large Population Sizes and properly configured 
      Selectors, the Attained Selection Fraction usually approaches the 
      Configured Selection Fraction. In Hash-based Selection, the 
      Expected Selection Fraction is the quotient of size of the Hash 
      Selection Range by the size of the Hash Range. 
       
       
      The notions of Configured/Attained Selection Fraction extend 
      beyond Selectors. An illustrative example is the Configured 
      Selection Fraction of the composition of the Measurement Process 
      with the Exporting Process. Here the Population is the Observed 
      Packet Stream or a subset thereof. The Configured Selection 
      Fraction is the fraction of the Population for which Packet 
      Reports which are expected to reach the Collector. This quantity 
      may reflect additional parameters, not necessarily described in 
      the PSAMP protocol, that determine the degree of loss suffered by 
      packet reports en route to the collector, e.g., the transmission 
      bandwidth available to the Exporting Process. In this example, 
      the Attained Selection Fraction is the fraction of Population 
      packets for which reports did actually reach the collector, and 
      thus incorporates the effect of any loss of Packet Reports due, 
      e.g, to resource contention at the Observation Point, or during 
      transmission.

   5.4 Input Sequence Numbers for Primitive Selectors 
         
      Each instance of a Primitive Selector must maintain a count of 
      packets presented at its input. The counter value is to be 
      included as a sequence number for selected packets. The sequence 
      numbers are considered as part of the packet's Selection State. 
       
      Use of input sequence numbers enables applications to determine 
      the Attained Selection Fraction, and hence correctly normalize 
      network usage estimates regardless of loss of information, 
      regardless of whether this loss occurs because of discard of 
      packet reports in the measurement or reporting process (e.g. due 
      to resource contention in the host of these processes), or loss 
      of export packets in transmission or collection. See [RFC-3176] 
      for further details. 
       
      As an example, consider a set of n consecutive packet reports r1, 
      r2,... , rn, selected by a sampling operation and received at a 
      collector. Let s1, s2,..., sn be the input sequence numbers 
      reported by the packets. The Attained Selection Fraction for the 
      composite of the measurement and exporting processes, taking into 
      account both packet sampling at the observation point and loss in 
      transmission, is computed as R = (n-1)/(sn-s1). (Note R would be 
      1 if all packets were selected and there were no transmission 
      loss). 
       
      The Attained Selection Fraction can be used to estimate the 
      number bytes present in a portion of the Observed Packet Stream. 
      Let b1, b2,..., bn be the bytes reported in each of the packets 
      that reached the Collector, and set B = b1+b2+...+bn. Then the 
      total bytes present in packets in the Observed Packet Stream 
      whose input sequence numbers lie between s1 and sn is estimated 
      by B/R, i.e, scaling up the measured bytes through division by 
      the Attained Selection Fraction 
       
      With Composite Selectors, and input sequence number must be 
      reported for each Selector in the composition. 
    
   5.5 Composite Selectors 
       
      The ability to compose Selectors in a Selection Process should be 
      provided. The following combinations appear to be most useful for 
      applications: 
             
      * filtering followed by sampling 
         
      * sampling followed by filtering 
       
      Composite Selectors are useful for drill down applications. The 
      first component of a composite selector can be used to reduce the 
      load on the second component. In this setting, the advantage to

      be gained from a given ordering can depends on the composition of 
      the packet stream. 
       
   5.6 Constraints on the Selection Fraction 
    
      Sampling at full line rate, i.e. with probability 1, is not 
      excluded in principle, although resource constraints may not 
      permit it in practice. 
       
   6. Reporting Process 
       
      This section details specific requirements for the Reporting 
      Process, motivated by the generic requirements of Section 3.4 
       
   6.1 Mandatory Contents of Packet Reports: Basic Reports 
       
      The Reporting Process must include the following in each Packet 
      Report: 
       
           (i) the input sequence number(s) of any sampling Selectors 
           that acted on the packet in the instance of a Measurement 
           Process of which the Reporting Process is a component. 
            
      The Reporting Process must support inclusion of the following in 
      each Packet Report, as a configurable option: 
       
           (ii) a basic report on the packet, i.e., some number of 
           contiguous bytes from the start of the packet, including the 
           packet header (which includes link layer, network layer and 
           other encapsulation headers) and some subsequent bytes of 
           the packet payload. 
            
      Some devices hosting Reporting Processes may not have the 
      resource capacity or functionality to provide more detailed 
      packet reports that those in (i) and (ii) above. Using this 
      minimum required reporting functionality, the reporting process 
      places the burden of interpretation on the Collector, or on 
      applications that it supplies. Some devices may have the 
      capability to provide extended packet reports, described in the 
      next section.  
    
   6.2 Extended Packet Reports 
    
      The reporting process may support inclusion in Packet Reports of 
      the following information, inclusion any or all being 
      configurable as an option. 
       
           (iii) fields relating to the following protocols used in the 
           packet: IPv4, IPV6, transport protocols, MPLS. 
             
           (iv) packet treatment, including:

            - identifiers for any input and output interfaces of the 
           Observation Point that were traversed by the packet 
             
            - source and destination BGP AS 
       
           (v) Selection State associated with the packet, including: 
       
           - the timestamp of observation of the packet at the 
           Observation Point. The timestamp should be reported to 
           microsecond resolution.  
       
           - hashes, where calculated. 
       
       It is envisaged that selection of fields for Extended Packet 
       Reporting may be used to reduce reporting bandwidth, in which 
       case the option to report information in (ii) may not be 
       exercised. 
    
   6.3 Extended Packet Reports in the Presence of IPFIX 
       
      If an IPFIX metering process is supported at the Observation 
      Point, then in order to be PSAMP compliant, Extended Packet 
      Reports must be able to include all fields required in the IPFIX 
      information model [IPFIX-INFO], with modifications appropriate to 
      reporting on single packets rather than flows. 
    
   6.4  Report Interpretation 
    
      Information for use in Report Interpretation must include  
       
           (i) configuration parameters of the Selectors of the packets 
           reported on.  
            
           (ii) format of the Packet Report; 
            
           (iii) indication of the inherent accuracy of the reported 
           quantities, e.g., of the packet timestamp.  
            
           (iv) identifiers for Observation Point, Measurement Process, 
           and Exporting Process.  
    
      The accuracy measure in (iii) is of fundamental importance for 
      estimating the likely error attached to estimates formed from the 
      Packet Reports by applications. 
       
      Identifiers in (iv) are necessary, e.g., in order to match Packet 
      Reports to the selection process that selected them. For example, 
      when Packet Reports produced by a sampling operation suffer loss 
      (either during export, or in transit) it may be desirable to 
      reconfigure downwards the Configured Selection Fraction on the 
      Selection Process that selected them.

      The requirements for robustness and transparency are motivations 
      for including Report Interpretation in the Report Stream: it 
      makes the Report Stream self-defining.  The PSAMP framework 
      excludes reliance on an alternative model in which interpretation 
      is recovered out of band. This latter approach is not robust with 
      respect to undocumented changes in Selector configuration, and 
      may give rise to future architectural problems for network 
      management systems to coherently manage both configuration and 
      data collection. 
       
      It is not envisaged that all Report Interpretation be included in 
      every packet report. Many of the quantities listed above are 
      expected to be relatively static; they could be communicated 
      periodically, and upon change. 
    
   7. Parallel Measurement Processes 
       
      Because of the increasing number of distinct measurement 
      applications, with varying requirements, it is desirable to set 
      up parallel Measurement Processes on a given Observed Packet 
      Stream. A device capable of hosting a Measurement Process should 
      be able to support more than one independently configurable 
      Measurement Process simultaneously. Each such Measurement Process 
      should have the option of being equipped with its own Exporting 
      Process; otherwise the parallel Measurement Processes may share 
      the same Exporting Process.  
       
      Each of the parallel Measurement Processes should be independent. 
      However, resource constraints may prevent complete reporting on a 
      packet selected by multiple Selection Processes. In this case, 
      reporting for the packet must be complete for at least one 
      Measurement Process; other measurement processes need only record 
      that they selected the packet, e.g., by incrementing a counter. 
      The priority amongst Measurement Processes under resource 
      contention should be configurable. 
       
      It is not proposed to standardize the number of parallel 
      Measurement Processes. 
       
   8. Exporting Process 
       
      This section detailes specific requirements for the Exporting 
      Process, motivated by the generic requirements of Section 3.6 
       
   8.1 Use of IPFIX 
       
      PSAMP will use the IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX) protocol 
      for export of the Report Stream. The IPFIX protocol is well 
      suited for this purpose, because the IPFIX architecture matches 
      the PSAMP architecture very well and the means provided by the 
      IPFIX protocol are sufficient for PSAMP purposes.

   8.2 Congestion-aware Unreliable Transport 
    
      The export of the report stream does not require reliable export.  
      Section 5.4 shows that the use of input sequence numbers in 
      packet Selectors means that the ability to estimate traffic rates 
      is not impaired by export loss. Export packet loss becomes 
      another form of sampling, albeit a less desirable, and less 
      controlled, form of sampling. 
       
      In distiction, retransmission of lost Export Packets consumes 
      additional network resources. The requirement to store 
      unacknowledged data is an impediment to having ubiquitous support 
      for PSAMP. 
       
      In order to jointly satisfy the timeliness and congestion 
      avoidance requirements of Section 4.3, a congestion aware 
      unreliable transport protocol must be used. IPFIX is compatible 
      with this requirement, since it mandates support of the Stream 
      Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [SCTP] and the SCTP Partial 
      Reliability Extension [RFC-3758]. IPFIX also allows the use of 
      User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [UDP] although it is not a 
      congestion aware protocol. However, in this case, the Export 
      Packets must remain wholly within the administrative domains of 
      the operators [IPFIX-PROTO]. 
       
   8.3 Limiting Delay for Export Packets 
          
      Low measurement latency allows the traffic monitoring system to 
      be more responsive to real-time network events, for example, in 
      quickly identifying sources of congestion. Timeliness is 
      generally a good thing for devices performing the sampling since 
      it minimizes the amount of memory needed to buffer samples. 
       
      Keeping the packet dispatching delay small has other benefits 
      besides limiting buffer requirements. For many applications a 
      resolution of 1 second is sufficient. Applications in this 
      category would include: identifying sources associated with 
      congestion; tracing denial of service attacks through the network 
      and constructing traffic matrices. Furthermore, keeping dispatch 
      delay within the resolution required by applications eliminates 
      the need for timestamping by synchronized clocks at observation 
      points, or for the Observation Points and Collector to maintain 
      bi-directional communication in order to track clock offsets. The 
      collector can simply process Packet Reports in the order that 
      they are received, using its own clock as a "global" time base. 
      This avoids the complexity of buffering and reordering samples. 
      See [DuGeGr02] for an example. 
       
      The delay between observation of a packet and transmission of a 
      Export Packet containing a report on that packet has several 
      components. It is difficult to standardize a given numerical 
      delay requirement, since in practice the delay may be sensitive 
    
   Duffield (Ed.)            Expires April 2005              [Page 21] 
    
   Internet Draft      Packet Selection and Reporting     October 2004 
    
    
      to processor load at the Observation Point. Therefore, PSAMP aims 
      to control that portion of the delay within the Observation Point 
      that is due to buffering in the formation and transmission of 
      Export Packets.  
    
      In order to limit delay in the formation of Export Packets, the 
      Exporting Process must provide the ability to close out and 
      enqueue for transmission any Export Packet during formation as 
      soon as it includes one Packet Report.  
       
      In order to limit the delay in the transmission of Export 
      Packets, a configurable upper bound to the delay of an Export 
      Packet prior to transmission must be provided. If the bound is 
      exceeded the Export Packet is dropped. This functionality can be 
      provided by the timed reliability service of the SCTP Partial 
      Reliability Extension [RFC-3758]. 
       
      The Exporting Process may enqueue the Report Stream in order to 
      export multiple Packet Reports in a single export packet. Any 
      consequent delay must still allow for timely availability of 
      Packet Reports as just described. The timed reliability service 
      of the SCTP Partial Reliability Extension [RFC-3758] allows from 
      the dropping of packets from the export buffer once their age in 
      the buffer exceeds a configurable bound. 
       
   8.4 Export Packet Compression 
       
      To conserve network bandwidth and resources at the Collector, the 
      Export Packets may be compressed before export.  Compression is 
      expected to be quite effective since the sampled packets may 
      share many fields in common, e.g. if a filter focuses on packets 
      with certain values in particular header fields. Using 
      compression, however, could impact the timeliness of Packet 
      Reports. Any consequent delay must not violate the timeliness 
      requirement for availability of Packet Reports at the collector. 
    
   8.5 Configurable Export Rate Limit 
       
      The exporting process must have an export rate limit, 
      configurable per Exporting Process. This is useful for two 
      reasons: 
       
           (i) Even without network congestion, the rate of packet 
           selection may exceed the capacity of the Collector to 
           process reports, particularly when many Exporting Processes 
           feed a common Collector. Use of an Export Rate Limit allows 
           control of the global input rate to the Collector. 
       
           (ii) IPFIX provides export using UDP as the transport 
           protocol in some circumstances. An Export Rate Limit allows 
           the capping of the export rate to match both path link 
           speeds and the capacity of the Collector.

   8.6 Collector Destination 
    
      When exporting to a remote Collector, the Collector is identified 
      by IP address, transport protocol, and transport port number. 
       
   8.7 Local Export 
       
      The Report Stream may be directly exported to on-board 
      measurement based applications, for example those that form 
      composite statistics from more than one packet. Local export may 
      be presented through an interface direct to the higher level 
      applications, i.e., through an API, rather than employing the 
      transport used for off-board export. Specification of such an API 
      is outside the scope of the PSAMP framework. 
       
      A possible example of Local Export could be that packets selected 
      by the PSAMP measurement process serve as the input for the IPFIX 
      protocol, which then forms flow records out of the stream of 
      selected packets.  
    
   9. Configuration and Management 
    
      A key requirement for PSAMP is the easy reconfiguration of the 
      parameters of the Measurement Process: those for selection, 
      packet reports and export. An important example is to support 
      measurement-based applications that want to adaptively drill-down 
      on traffic detail in real-time;  
       
      To facilitate reconfiguration and retrieval of parameters, they 
      are to reside in a Management Information Base (MIB). Mandatory 
      configuration, capabilities and monitoring objects will cover all 
      mandatory PSAMP functionality. 
       
      Secondary objects will cover the recommended and optional PSAMP 
      functionality, and must be provided when such functionality is 
      offered by a PSAMP device. Such PSAMP functionality includes 
      configuration of offered Selectors, multiple Measurement 
      Processes, and report format including the choice of fields to be 
      reported. For further details concerning the PSAMP MIB, see 
      [PSAMP-MIB]. 
       
      PSAMP requires a uniform mechanism with which to access and 
      configure the MIB. SNMP access must be provided by the host of 
      the MIB. 
    
   10.       Feasibility and Complexity 
       
      In order for PSAMP to be supported across the entire spectrum of 
      networking equipment, it must be simple and inexpensive to 
      implement.  One can envision easy-to-implement instances of the 
      mechanisms described within this draft. Thus, for that subset of 
    
   Duffield (Ed.)            Expires April 2005              [Page 23] 
    
   Internet Draft      Packet Selection and Reporting     October 2004 
    
    
      instances, it should be straightforward for virtually all system 
      vendors to include them within their products. Indeed, sampling 
      and filtering operations are already realized in available 
      equipment. 
       
      Here we give some specific arguments to demonstrate feasibility 
      and comment on the complexity of hardware implementations. We 
      stress here that the point of these arguments is not to favor or 
      recommend any particular implementation, or to suggest a path for 
      standardization, but rather to demonstrate that the set of 
      possible implementations is not empty. 
       
   10.1     Feasibility 
          
   10.1.1  Filtering 
       
      Filtering consists of a small number of mask (bit-wise logical), 
      comparison and range (greater than) operations.  Implementation 
      of at least a small number of such operations is straightforward. 
      For example, filters for security access control lists (ACLs) are 
      widely implemented. This could be as simple as an exact match on 
      certain fields, or involve more complex comparisons and ranges. 
       
   10.1.2  Sampling 
       
      Sampling based on either counters (counter set, decrement, test 
      for equal to zero) or range matching on the hash of a packet 
      (greater than) is possible given a small number of selectors, 
      although there may be some differences in ease of implementation 
      for hardware vs. software platforms. 
       
   10.1.3  Hashing  
          
      Hashing functions vary greatly in complexity.  Execution of a 
      small number of sufficient simple hash functions is implementable 
      at line rate. Concerning the input to the hash function, hop 
      invariant IP header fields (IP address, IP identification) and 
      TCP/UDP header fields (port numbers, TCP sequence number) drawn 
      from the first 40 bytes of the packet have been found to possess 
      a considerable variability; see [DuGr01]. 
       
   10.1.4  Reporting 
       
      The simplest packet report would duplicate the first n bytes of 
      the packet. However, such an uncompressed format may tax the 
      bandwidth available to the reporting process for high sampling 
      rates; reporting selected fields would save on this bandwidth. 
      Thus there is a trade-off between simplicity and bandwidth 
      limitations. 
       
   10.1.5  Export 
       
    
   Duffield (Ed.)            Expires April 2005              [Page 24] 
    
   Internet Draft      Packet Selection and Reporting     October 2004 
    
    
      Ease of exporting export packets depends on the system 
      architecture. Most systems should be able to support export by 
      insertion of export packets, even through the software path. 
        
   10.2    Potential Hardware Complexity 
       
      We now comment on the complexity of possible hardware 
      implementations. Achieving low constants for performance while 
      minimizing hardware resources is, of course, a challenge, 
      especially at very high clock frequencies. Most of these 
      operations, however, are very basic and their implementations 
      very well understood; in fact, the average ASIC designer simply 
      uses canned library instances of these operations rather than 
      design them from scratch. In addition, networking equipment 
      generally does not need to run at the fastest clock rates, 
      further reducing the effort required to get reasonably efficient 
      implementations. 
       
      Simple bit-wise logical operations are easy to implement in 
      hardware.  Such operations (NAND/NOR/XNOR/NOT) directly translate 
      to four-transistor gates.  Each bit of a multiple-bit logical 
      operation is completely independent and thus can be performed in 
      parallel incurring no additional performance cost above a single 
      bit operation. 
       
      Comparisons (EQ/NEQ) take O(lg(M)) stages of logic, where M is 
      the number of bits involved in the comparison.  The lg(M) is 
      required to accumulate the result into a single bit. 
       
      Greater than operations, as used to determine whether a hash 
      falls in a selection range, are a determination of the most 
      significant not-equivalent bit in the two operands.  The operand 
      with that most-significant-not-equal bit set to be one is greater 
      than the other.  Thus, a greater than operation is also an 
      O(lg(M)) stages of logic operation. Optimized implementations of 
      arithmetic operations are also O(lg(M)) due to propagation of the 
      carry bit. 
       
      Setting a counter is simply loading a register with a state. Such 
      an operation is simple and fast O(1).  Incrementing or 
      decrementing a counter is a read, followed by an arithmetic 
      operation followed by a store.  Making the register dual-ported 
      does take additional space, but it is a well-understood 
      technique.  Thus, the increment/decrement is also an O(lg(M)) 
      operation. 
       
      Hashing functions come in a variety of forms.  The computation 
      involved in a standard Cyclic Redundancy Code (CRC) for example 
      are essentially a set of XOR operations, where the intermediate 
      result is stored and XORed with the next chunk of data.  There 
      are only O(1) operations and no log complexity operations.  Thus,

      a simple hash function, such as CRC or generalizations thereof, 
      can be implemented in hardware very efficiently. 
       
      At the other end of the range of complexity, the MD5 function 
      uses a large number of bit-wise conditional operations and 
      arithmetic operations.  The former are O(1) operations and the 
      latter are O(lg(M)). MD5 specifies 256 32b ADD operations per 16B 
      of input processed.  Consider processing 10Gb/sec at 100MHz (this 
      processing rate appears to be currently available). This requires 
      processing 12.5B/cycle, and hence at least 200 adders, a sizeable 
      number. Because of data dependencies within the MD5 algorithm, 
      the adders cannot be simply run in parallel, thus requiring 
      either faster clock rates and/or more advanced architectures. 
      Thus, selection hashing functions as complex as MD5 may be 
      precluded for ubiquitous use at full line rate. This motivates 
      exploring the use of selection hash functions with complexity 
      somewhere between that of MD5 and CRC. In some applications (see 
      Section below) a second hash may be calculated on only selected 
      packets;  MD5 is feasible for this purpose if the rate of 
      production of selected packets is sufficiently low. 
          
   11.       Applications  
          
      We first describe several representative operational applications 
      that require traffic measurements at various levels of temporal 
      and spatial granularity. Some of the goals here appear similar to 
      those of IPFIX, at least in the broad classes of applications 
      supported. The major benefit of PSAMP is the support of new 
      network management applications, specifically, those enabled by 
      the packet selectors that it supports.  
       
   11.1    Baseline Measurement and Drill Down 
       
      Packet sampling is ideally suited to determine the composition of 
      the traffic across a network. The approach is to enable 
      measurement on a cut-set of the network links such that each 
      packet entering the network is seen at least once, for example, 
      on all ingress links. Unfiltered sampling with a relatively low 
      selection fraction establishes baseline measurements of the 
      network traffic. Packet reports include packet attributes of 
      common interest: source and destination address and port numbers, 
      prefix, protocol number, type of service, etc. Traffic matrices 
      are indicated by reporting source and destination AS matrices. 
      Absolute traffic volumes are estimated by renormalizing the 
      sampled traffic volumes through division by either the Configured 
      Selection Fraction, or by the Attained Selection Fraction (as 
      derived from input packet counters included in the report stream)  
       
      Suppose an operator or a measurement-based application detects an 
      interesting subset of a packet stream, as identified by a 
      particular packet attribute. Real-time drill-down to that subset 
      is achieved by instantiating a new Measurement Process on the

   Internet Draft      Packet Selection and Reporting     October 2004 
    
    
      same Observed Packet Stream from which the subset was reported. 
      The Selection Process of the new Measurement Process filters 
      according to the attribute of interest, and composes with 
      sampling if necessary to manage the attained fraction of packets 
      selected  
       
   11.2    Trajectory Sampling 
       
       
      The goal of trajectory sampling is the selection of a subset of  
      packets at all enabled Observation Points at which they are 
      observed in a network domain. Thus the selection decisions are 
      consistent in the sense that each packet is selected either at 
      all enabled Observation Points, or at none of them. Trajectory 
      sampling is realized by hash-based selection if all enabled 
      Observation Points apply a common hash function to a portion of 
      the packet content that is invariant along the packet path. 
      (Thus, fields such at TTL and CRC are excluded). 
       
       
      The trajectory followed by a packet is reconstructed from packet 
      reports on it that reach the collector. Reports on a given packet 
      are associated either by matching a label comprising the 
      invariant reported packet content, or possibly some digest of it. 
      The reconstruction of trajectories, and methods for dealing with 
      possible ambiguities due to label collisions (identical labels 
      reported by different packets) and potential loss of reports in 
      transmission are dealt with in [DuGr01], [DuGeGr02] and [DuGr04]. 
       
   11.3    Passive Performance Measurement 
         
      Trajectory sampling enables the tracking of the performance 
      experience by customer traffic, customers identified by a list of 
      source or destination prefixes, or by ingress or egress 
      interfaces. Operational uses include the verification of Service 
      Level Agreements (SLAs), and troubleshooting following a customer 
      complaint. 
       
      In this application, trajectory sampling is enabled at all 
      network ingress and egress interfaces. Rates of loss in transit 
      between ingress and egress are estimated from the proportion of 
      trajectories for which no egress report is received. Note that 
      loss of customer packets is distinguishable from loss of packet 
      reports through use of report sequence numbers. Assuming 
      synchronization of clocks between different entities, delay of 
      customer traffic across the network may also be measured; see 
      [Zs02]. 
       
      Extending hash-selection to all interfaces in the network would 
      enable attribution of poor performance to individual network 
      links.

   11.4    Troubleshooting 
       
      PSAMP Packet Reports can also be used to diagnose problems whose 
      occurrence is evident from aggregate statistics, per interface 
      utilization and packet loss statistics.  These statistics are 
      typically moving averages over relatively long time windows, 
      e.g., 5 minutes, and serve as a coarse-grain indication of 
      operational health of the network. The most common method of 
      obtaining such measurements are through the appropriate SNMP MIBs 
      (MIB-II [RFC-1213] and vendor-specific MIBs.) 
       
      Suppose an operator detects a link that is persistently 
      overloaded and experiences significant packet drop rates. There 
      is a wide range of potential causes: routing parameters (e.g., 
      OSPF link weights) that are poorly adapted to the traffic matrix, 
      e.g., because of a shift in that matrix; a denial of service 
      attack or a flash crowd; a routing problem (link flapping). In 
      most cases, aggregate link statistics are not sufficient to 
      distinguish between such causes, and to decide on an appropriate 
      corrective action. For example, if routing over two links is 
      unstable, and the links flap between being overloaded and 
      inactive, this might be averaged out in a 5 minute window, 
      indicating moderate loads on both links. 
       
      Baseline PSAMP measurement of the congested link, as described in 
      Section 11.1, enables measurements that are fine grained in both 
      space and time. The operator has to be able to determine how many 
      bytes/packets are generated for each source/destination address, 
      port number, and prefix, or other attributes, such as protocol 
      number, MPLS forwarding equivalence class (FEC), type of service, 
      etc. This allows the precise determination of the nature of the 
      offending traffic. For example, in the case of a Distributed 
      Denial of Service(DDoS) attack, the operator would see a 
      significant fraction of traffic with an identical destination 
      address. 
       
      In certain circumstances, precise information about the spatial 
      flow of traffic through the network domain is required to detect 
      and diagnose problems and verify correct network behavior. In the 
      case of the overloaded link, it would be very helpful to know the 
      precise set of paths that packets traversing this link follow. 
      This would readily reveal a routing problem such as a loop, or a 
      link with a misconfigured weight. More generally, complex 
      diagnosis scenarios can benefit from measurement of traffic 
      intensities (and other attributes) over a set of paths that is 
      constrained in some way. For example, if a multihomed customer 
      complains about performance problems on one of the access links 
      from a particular source address prefix, the operator should be 
      able to examine in detail the traffic from that source prefix 
      which also traverses the specified access link towards the 
      customer.

      While it is in principle possible to obtain the spatial flow of 
      traffic through auxiliary network state information, e.g., by 
      downloading routing and forwarding tables from routers, this 
      information is often unreliable, outdated, voluminous, and 
      contingent on a network model. For operational purposes, a direct 
      observation of traffic flow provided by trajectory sampling is 
      more reliable, as it does not depend on any such auxiliary 
      information. For example, if there was a bug in a router's 
      software, direct observation would allow the diagnosis the effect 
      of this bug, while an indirect method would not.
