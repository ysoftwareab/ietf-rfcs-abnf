2.  Introduction

   This draft proposes a mechanism to convey accounting information
   using the PIM protocol [RFC4601] [RFC5015].  Putting the mechanism in
   PIM allows efficient distribution and maintenance of such accounting
   information.  Previous mechanisms require data to be correlated from
   multiple router sources.

   This proposal allows a single router to be queried to obtain
   accounting and statistic information for a multicast distribution
   tree as a whole or any distribution sub-tree downstream from a
   queried router.  The amount of information is fixed and does not
   increase as multicast membership, tree diameter, or branching
   increase.

   The sort of accounting data this draft provides, on a per multicast
   route basis, are:

   1.  The number of branches in a distribution tree.

   2.  The membership type of the distribution tree, that is SSM or ASM.

   3.  Routing domain and time zone boundary information.

   4.  On-tree node and tree diameter counters.

   5.  Effective MTU and bandwidth.

   This draft adds a new PIM Join Attribute type [RFC5384] to the Join/
   Prune message as well as a new Hello TLV.  The mechanism is
   applicable to IPv4 and IPv6 multicast.

2.1.  Terminology

   This section defines the terms used in this draft.

   Multicast Route:   A (S,G) or (*,G) entry regardless if the route is
      in ASM, SSM, or Bidir mode of operation.

   Stub Link:   A link with only members joined to the group via IGMP or
      MLD.  Which means there are no PIM routers joining for the
      multicast route on the link.

   Transit Link:   A link put in the oif-list for a multicast route
      because it was joined by PIM routers only (no IGMP or MLD reports
      were received on the link).

   Dual Link:   Is a link in the oif-list which is has the attributes of
      a Stub Link *and* Transit Link.  That is, there are IGMP and MLD
      members as well as PIM joiners for the multicast route on the
      link.

3.  New Hello TLV Pop-Count Support

   When a PIM router sends a Join/Prune message to a neighbor, it will
   encode the data in a new PIM Join Attribute type (described in this
   draft) when the PIM router determines the neighbor can support this
   draft.  If a PIM router supports this draft, it must send the Pop-
   Count-Supported TLV.  The format of the TLV is defined to be:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |       OptionType              |         OptionLength          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                          OptionValue                          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   OptionType = 27, OptionLength = 8, there is no OptionValue semantics
   defined at this time but will be included for expandability and be
   defined in future revisions of this draft.  The format will look
   like:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |             27                |              8                |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                      Unallocated Flags                        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Unallocated Flags:   for now should be sent as 0 and ignored on
      receipt.  This field could be used to enable the use of future
      flags in the Unallocated Flags field of the new Encoded-Source-
      Address format defined below.

4.  New Pop-Count Join Attribute Format

   When a PIM router supports this draft and has determined from a
   received Hello, the neighbor supports this draft, it will send Join/
   Prune messages that MAY include a Pop-Count attribute.  The mechanism
   to process PIM Join Attribute is described in [RFC5384].  The format
   of the new attribute is described in the following.


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |F|E| Attr Type | Length        | Effective MTU                 |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |          Unallocated Flags (Reserved)               |P|a|t|A|S|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Domain Count |  Node Count   | Diameter Count|    TZ Count   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |    Transit Oif-List Count     |     Stub Oif-List Count       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      Minimum Speed Link       |      Maximum Speed Link       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The above format is used only for entries in the join-list section of
   the Join/Prune message.

   F bit:   0 Non-Transitive Attribute.

   E bit:   As specified by [RFC5384].

   Attr Type:   2.

   Length:   16.

   Effective MTU:   this contains the minimum MTU for any link in the
      oif-list.  The sender of Join/Prune message takes the minimum
      value for the MTU (in bytes) from each link in the oif-list.  If
      this value is less than the value stored for the multicast route
      (the one received from downstream joiners) then the value should
      be reset and sent in Join/Prune message.  Otherwise, the value
      should remain unchanged.

      This provides one to obtain the MTU supported by multicast
      distribution tree when examined at the first-hop router(s) or for
      sub-tree for any router on the distribution tree.

Internet-Draft     Population Count Extensions to PIM          July 2009


   Unallocated Flags:   The flags which are currently not defined.  If a
      new flag is defined and sent by a new implementation, an old
      implementation should preserve the bit settings.

   S flag:   if an IGMPv3 or MLDv2 report was received on any oif-list
      entry or the bit was set from any PIM Join message.  This bit
      should only be cleared when the above becomes untrue.

   A flag:   if an IGMPv1, IGMPv2, or MLDv1 report was received on any
      oif-list entry or the bit was set from any PIM Join message.  This
      bit should only be cleared when the above becomes untrue.

   A combination of settings for these bits indicate:


     a-flag   s-flag   Description
     ------   ------   -----------------------------------------
       0        0      There are no members for the group
                       ('Stub Oif-List Count' is 0)
       0        1      All group members are only SSM capable
       1        0      All group members are only ASM capable
       1        1      There is a mixture of SSM and ASM capable

   t flag:   if there are any tunnels on the distribution tree.  If a
      tunnel is in the oif-list, a router should set this bit in it's
      Join/Prune messages.  Otherwise, it propagates the bit setting
      from downstream joiners.

   a flag:   if there are any auto-tunnels on the distribution tree.  If
      an auto-tunnel is in the oif-list, a router should set this bit in
      it's Join/Prune messages.  Otherwise, it propagates the bit
      setting from downstream joiners.  An example of an auto-tunnel is
      an tunnel setup by the AMT [AMT] protocol.

   P flag:   this flag remains set if all downstream routers support
      this specification.  That is, they are PIM pop-count capable.
      This allows one to tell if the entire sub-tree is completely
      accounting capable.

   Domain Count:   this indicates the number of routing domains the
      distribution tree traverses.  A router should increment this value
      if it is sending a Join/Prune message over a link which traverses
      a domain boundary.

   Node Count:   This indicates the number of routers on the
      distribution tree.  Each router will sum up all the Node Counts
      from all joiners on all oifs and increment by 1 before including
      this value in the Join/Prune message.

Internet-Draft     Population Count Extensions to PIM          July 2009


   Diameter Count:   this indicates the longest length of any given
      branch of the tree in router hops.  Each router that sends a Join
      increments the max value received by all downstream joiners by 1.

   TZ Count:   this indicates the number of timezones the distribution
      tree traverses.  A router should increment this value if it is
      sending a Join/Prune message over a link which traverses a time
      zone.  This can be a configured link attribute or use other means
      to determine the timezone is acceptable.

   Transit Oif-List Count:   is filled in by a router sending a Join/
      Prune message which is equal to the number of oifs for the
      multicast route that has been joined by PIM only.  This indicates
      the transit branches on a multicast distribution tree (no members
      on the links between this router and joining routers).  This is
      added to the value advertised by all downstream PIM routers that
      have joined on this oif.

   Stub Oif-List Count:   is filled in by a router sending a Join/Prune
      message which is equal to the number of oifs for the multicast
      route that has been joined only by IGMP or MLD.  This indicates
      the links where there are host members for the multicast route.
      This is added to the value advertised by all downstream PIM
      routers that have joined on this oif.

   Minimum Speed Link:   this contains the minimum bandwidth rate (in
      mbps) for any link in the oif-list.  The sender of Join/Prune
      message takes the minimum value for each link in the oif-list for
      the multicast route.  If this value is less than the value stored
      for the multicast route (the one received from downstream joiners)
      then the value should be reset and sent in Join/Prune message.
      Otherwise, the value should remain unchanged.  A value of 0 means
      the link speed is < 1 mbps.

   Maximum Speed Link:   this contains the maximum bandwidth rate (in
      mbps) for any link in the oif-list.  The sender of Join/Prune
      message takes the maximum value for each link in the oif-list for
      the multicast route.  If this value is greater than the value
      stored for the multicast route (the one received from downstream
      joiners) then the value should be reset and sent in Join/Prune
      message.  Otherwise, the value should remain unchanged.  A value
      of 0 means the link speed is < 1 mbps.

   This provides a way to obtain the lowest and highest speed link for
   the multicast distribution tree.

5.  How to use Pop-Count Encoding

   A router supporting this draft MUST include PIM Join Attribute TLV in
   its PIM Hellos.  See [RFC5384] and [HELLO] for detail.

   It is very important to note that any changes to the values
   maintained in this draft *must not* trigger a new Join/Prune message.
   Due to the periodic nature of PIM, the values can be accurately
   obtained at 1 minute intervals (or whatever Join/Prune interval
   used).

   When a router removes a link from an oif-list, it must be able to
   reevaluate the values that it will advertise upstream.  This happens
   when an oif-list entry is timed out or a Prune is received.

   It is recommended that the Join Attribute defined in this draft be
   used for entries in the join-list part of the Join/Prune message.  If
   the new encoding is used in the prune-list or an Assert message, an
   implementation must ignore them but still process the Prune as if it
   was in the original encoding described in [RFC4601].

   It is also recommended that join suppression be disabled on a LAN
   when Pop-Count is used.

6.  Implementation Approaches

   An implementation can decide how the accounting attributes are
   maintained.  The values can be stored as part of the multicast route
   data structure by combining the local information it has with the
   joined information on a per oif basis.  So when it is time to send a
   Join/Prune message, the values stored in the multicast route can be
   copied to the message.

   Or, an implementation could store the accounting values per oif and
   when a Join/Prune message is sent, it can combine the oifs with it's
   local information.  Then the combined information can be copied to
   the message.

   When a downstream joiner stops joining, accounting values cached must
   be evaluated.  There are two approaches which can be taken.  One is
   to keep values learned from each joiner so when the joiner goes away
   the count/max/min values are known and the combined value can be
   adjusted.  The other approach is to set the value to 0 for the oif,
   and then start accumulating new values as subsequent Joins are
   received.

   The same issue arises when an oif is removed from the oif-list.
   Keeping per-oif values allows you to adjust the per-route values when
   an oif goes away.  Or, alternatively, a delay for reporting the new
   set a values from the route can occur while all oif values are zeroed
   (where accumulation of new values from subsequent Joins cause re-
   population of values and a new max/min/ count can be reevaluated for
   the route).

   It is recommended that when triggered Join/Prune messages are sent by
   a downstream router, that the accounting information not be included
   in the message.  This way when convergence is important, avoiding the
   processing time to build an accounting record in a downstream router
   and processing time to parse the message in the upstream router will
   help reduce convergence time.  An upstream router should not
   interpret a Join/Prune message received with no acccounting data to
   mean clearing or resetting what accounting data it has cached.

7.  Caveats

   This draft requires each router on a multicast distribution tree to
   support this draft or else the accounting attributes for the tree
   will not be known.

   However, if there are a contiguous set of routers downstream in the
   distribution tree, they can maintain accounting information for the
   sub-tree.

   If there are a set of contiguous routers supporting this draft
   upstream on the multicast distribution tree, accounting information
   will be available but it will not represent an accurate assessment of
   the entire tree.  Also, it will not be clear for how much of the
   distribution tree the accounting information covers.

8.  IANA Considerations

   A new PIM Hello Option type needs to be assigned. 29 is proposed in
   this draft.

   A new PIM Join Attribute type needs to be assigned. 2 is proposed in
   this draft.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations for this design other than what
   is already in the main PIM specification [RFC4601].
