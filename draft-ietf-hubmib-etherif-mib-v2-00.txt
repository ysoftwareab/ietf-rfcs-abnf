Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   This memo obsoletes RFC 2358 ''Definitions of Managed Objects for the
   Ethernet-like Interface Types''.  This memo extends that
   specification by including management information useful for the
   management of 1000 Mb/s and full-duplex Ethernet interfaces.

   Ethernet technology, as defined by the 802.3 Working Group of the
   IEEE, continues to evolve, with scalable increases in speed, new
   types of cabling and interfaces, and new features.  This evolution
   may require changes in the managed objects in order to reflect this
   new functionality.  This document, as with other documents issued by

1. Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing Ethernet-like
   interfaces.

   This memo also includes a MIB module.  This MIB module extends the
   list of managed objects specified in the earlier version of this MIB:
   RFC2358 [26].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
        called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC
        1904 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
        called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
        The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
        described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
        and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
        [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the

   MIB.


3.  Overview

   Instances of these object types represent attributes of an interface
   to an ethernet-like communications medium.  At present, ethernet-like
   media are identified by the following values of the ifType object in
   the Interfaces MIB [28]:

            ethernetCsmacd(6)
            iso88023Csmacd(7)
            starLan(11)

   The definitions presented here are based on IEEE Draft 802.3z/D4.2,
   Section 30 [19], as originally interpreted by Frank Kastenholz then
   of Interlan in [20].  Implementors of these MIB objects should note
   that IEEE Std. 802.3 ([16], [17], and [18]) and IEEE Draft 802.3z
   [19] explicitly describe (in the form of Pascal pseudocode) when,
   where, and how various MAC attributes are measured. The IEEE
   documents also describe the effects of MAC actions that may be
   invoked by manipulating instances of the MIB objects defined here.

   To the extent that some of the attributes defined in [19] are
   represented by previously defined objects in MIB-2 [27] or in the
   Interfaces MIB [28], such attributes are not redundantly represented
   by objects defined in this memo.  Among the attributes represented by
   objects defined in other memos are the number of octets transmitted
   or received on a particular interface, the number of frames
   transmitted or received on a particular interface, the promiscuous
   status of an interface, the MAC address of an interface, and
   multicast information associated with an interface.


3.1.  Relation to MIB-2

   This section applies only when this MIB is used in conjunction with
   the "old" (RFC 1213) [27] interface group.

   The relationship between an ethernet-like interface and an interface
   in the context of the Internet-standard MIB is one-to-one.  As such,
   the value of an ifIndex object instance can be directly used to
   identify corresponding instances of the objects defined herein.

   For agents which implement the (now deprecated) ifSpecific object, an
   instance of that object that is associated with an ethernet-like
   interface has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:

         dot3    OBJECT IDENTIFER ::= { transmission 7 }



3.2.  Relation to the Interfaces MIB

   The Interface MIB [28] requires that any MIB which is an adjunct of
   the Interface MIB clarify specific areas within the Interface MIB.
   These areas were intentionally left vague in the Interface MIB to
   avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby precluding management of
   certain media-types.

   Section 3.3 of [28] enumerates several areas which a media-specific
   MIB must clarify.  Each of these areas is addressed in a following
   subsection.  The implementor is referred to [28] in order to
   understand the general intent of these areas.


3.2.1.  Layering Model

   This MIB does not provide for layering.  There are no sublayers.

   EDITOR'S NOTE:

   One could foresee the development of an 802.2 and enet-transceiver
   MIB.  They could be higher and lower sublayers, respectively.  All
   that THIS document should do is allude to the possibilities and urge
   the implementor to be aware of the possibility and that they may have
   requirements which supersede the requirements in this document.


3.2.2.  Virtual Circuits

   This medium does not support virtual circuits and this area is not
   applicable to this MIB.


3.2.3.  ifTestTable

   This MIB defines two tests for media which are instrumented with this
   MIB; TDR and Loopback.  Implementation of these tests is not
   required.  Many common interface chips do not support one or both of
   these tests.

   These two tests are provided as a convenience, allowing a common
   method to invoke the test.

   Standard MIBs do not include objects in which to return the results



Flick, et. al.           Expires February 1999                  [Page 5]

Internet Draft             Ethernet-Like MIB                 August 1998


   of the TDR test.  Any needed objects MUST be provided in the vendor
   specific MIB.

   Note that the ifTestTable is now deprecated.  Work is underway to
   define a replacement MIB for system and interface testing.  It is
   expected that the tests defined in this document will be usable in
   this replacement MIB.


3.2.4.  ifRcvAddressTable

   This table contains all IEEE 802.3 addresses, unicast, multicast, and
   broadcast, for which this interface will receive packets and forward
   them up to a higher layer entity for local consumption.  The format
   of the address, contained in ifRcvAddressAddress, is the same as for
   ifPhysAddress.

   In the event that the interface is part of a MAC bridge, this table
   does not include unicast addresses which are accepted for possible
   forwarding out some other port.  This table is explicitly not
   intended to provide a bridge address filtering mechanism.


3.2.5.  ifPhysAddress

   This object contains the IEEE 802.3 address which is placed in the
   source-address field of any Ethernet, Starlan, or IEEE 802.3 frames
   that originate at this interface.  Usually this will be kept in ROM
   on the interface hardware.  Some systems may set this address via
   software.

   In a system where there are several such addresses the designer has a
   tougher choice.  The address chosen should be the one most likely to
   be of use to network management (e.g.  the address placed in ARP
   responses for systems which are primarily IP systems).

   If the designer truly can not chose, use of the factory- provided ROM
   address is suggested.

   If the address can not be determined, an octet string of zero length
   should be returned.

   The address is stored in binary in this object.  The address is
   stored in "canonical" bit order, that is, the Group Bit is positioned
   as the low-order bit of the first octet.  Thus, the first byte of a
   multicast address would have the bit 0x01 set.

Internet Draft             Ethernet-Like MIB                 August 1998


3.2.6.  ifType

   This MIB applies to interfaces which have any of the following ifType
   values:

            ethernetCsmacd(6)
            iso88023Csmacd(7)
            starLan(11)

   It is RECOMMENDED that all Ethernet-like interfaces use an ifType of
   ethernetCsmacd(6) regardless of the speed that the interface is
   running or the link-layer encapsulation in use.  iso88023Csmacd(7)
   and starLan(11) are supported for backwards compatability.

   There are three other interface types defined in the IANAifType-MIB
   for 100 Mbit Ethernet.  They are fastEther(62), fastEtherFX(69), and
   gigabitEthernet(117).  This document takes the position that an
   Ethernet is an Ethernet, and Ethernet interfaces SHOULD always have
   the same value of ifType.  Information on the particular flavor of
   Ethernet that an interface is running is available from ifSpeed in
   the Interfaces MIB, and ifMauType in the 802.3 MAU MIB.  An
   Ethernet-like interface SHOULD NOT use the fastEther(62),
   fastEtherFX(69), or gigabitEthernet(117) ifTypes.

   Interfaces with any of the supported ifType values map to the
   EtherLike-MIB in the same manner.  Which compliance statement an
   interface should implement is dependent on the maximum speed
   supported on the interface.  The EtherLike-MIB etherCompliance
   compliance statement applies to all Ethernet-like interfaces whose
   maximum supported speed is 10 Mbit/sec or less.  There are no
   implementation differences. Similarly, the EtherLike-MIB
   ether100MbsCompliance compliance statement applies to all Ethernet-
   like interfaces whose maximum supported speed is 100Mbit/sec.

   An interface that is capable of operating at 100Mbit/sec MUST
   implement the ether100MbsCompliance compliance statement, even if it
   is currently operating at a lower speed.  Counters in the
   ether100MbsCompliance compliance statement that only apply to 100
   Mbit interfaces would simply not increment when the interface is
   operating at a lower speed.


3.2.7.  Specific Interface MIB Objects

   The following table provides specific implementation guidelines for
   applying the interface group objects to ethernet-like media.

     ifIndex                    Each ethernet-like interface is
                                represented by an ifEntry.  The
                                dot3StatsTable in this MIB module is
                                indexed by dot3StatsIndex. The interface
                                identified by a particular value of
                                dot3StatsIndex is the same interface as
                                identified by the same value of ifIndex.

     ifDescr                    Refer to [28].

     ifType                     Refer to section 3.2.6.

     ifMtu                      1500 octets.  NOTE: This is the MTU as
                                seen by the MAC client.  When a higher
                                layer protocol, like IP, is running over
                                Ethernet, this is the MTU that will be
                                seen by that higher layer protocol.
                                However, when using the IEEE 802.2 LLC
                                protocol, higher layer protocols will
                                see a different MTU.  In particular, an
                                LLC type 1 client protocol will see
                                an MTU of 1497 octets, and a protocol
                                running over SNAP will see an MTU of
                                1492 octets.

     ifSpeed                    The current operational speed of the
                                interface in bits per second. For
                                current ethernet-like interfaces, this
                                will be equal to 1,000,000 (1 million),
                                10,000,000 (10 million), 100,000,000
                                (100 million), or 1,000,000,000 (1
                                billion). If the interface implements
                                auto-negotiation, auto-negotiation is
                                enabled for this interface, and the
                                interface has not yet negotiated to an
                                operational speed, this object SHOULD
                                reflect the maximum speed supported by
                                the interface.  Note that this object
                                MUST NOT indicate a doubled value when
                                operating in full-duplex mode.  It MUST
                                indicate the correct line speed
                                regardless of the current duplex mode.
                                The correct object to use to determine
                                the duplex mode of the interface is the
                                ifMauType object in the 802.3 MAU MIB.

                                and therefore may require support for
                                these counters.

     ifHighSpeed                The current operational speed of the
                                interface in millions of bits per
                                second. For current ethernet-like
                                interfaces, this will be equal to 1, 10,
                                100, or 1,000.  If the interface
                                implements auto-negotiation,
                                auto-negotiation is enabled for this
                                interface, and the interface has not yet
                                negotiated to an operational speed, this
                                object SHOULD reflect the maximum speed
                                supported by the interface. Note that
                                this object MUST NOT indicate a doubled
                                value when operating in full-duplex
                                mode.  It MUST indicate the correct line
                                speed regardless of the current duplex
                                mode.  The correct object to use to
                                determine the duplex mode of the

3.3.  Relation to the 802.3 MAU MIB

   Support for the mauModIfCompl compliance statement of the MAU-MIB
   [30] is REQUIRED for Ethernet-like interfaces.  This MIB is needed in
   order to allow applications to determine the current MAU type in use
   by the interface.  The MAU type indicates not only the media type in
   use, but also indicates whether the interface is operating in half-
   duplex or full-duplex mode.  Implementing this MIB module without
   implementing the MAU-MIB would leave applications with no standard
   way to determine the duplex mode of the interface.

   * Note that the octet counters in IF-MIB do not exactly match the
   definition of the octet counters in IEEE 802.3.  aOctetsTransmittedOK
   and aOctetsReceivedOK count only the octets in the clientData and Pad
   fields, whereas ifInOctets and ifOutOctets include the entire MAC
   frame, including MAC header and FCS.  However, the IF-MIB counters
   can be derived from the IEEE 802.3 counters as follows:

     ifInOctets = aOctetsReceivedOK + (18 * aFramesReceivedOK)
     ifOutOctets = aOctetsTransmittedOK + (18 * aFramesTransmittedOK)

   The following IEEE 802.3 managed objects have been removed from this
   MIB module as a result of implementation feedback:

   oMacEntity
     .aFramesWithExcessiveDeferral
     .aInRangeLengthErrors
     .aOutOfRangeLengthField
     .aMACEnableStatus
     .aTransmitEnableStatus
     .aMulticastReceiveStatus
     .acInitializeMAC

   Please see [22] for the detailed reasoning on why these objects were
   removed.

6.  Acknowledgements

   This document was produced by the 802.3 Hub MIB Working Group.

   This document is based on the Proposed Standard Ethernet MIB, RFC
   2358 [26], edited by John Flick of Hewlett-Packard and Jeffrey
   Johnson of RedBack Networks and produced by the Ethernet Interfaces
   and Hub MIB Working Group.  It extends that document by providing
   support for full-duplex Ethernet interfaces as outlined in [18] and
   1000 Mb/sec Ethernet interfaces as outlined in [19].

   RFC 2358, in turn, is almost completely based on both the Standard
   Ethernet MIB, RFC 1643 [24], and the Proposed Standard Ethernet MIB
   using the SNMPv2 SMI, RFC 1650 [25], both of which were edited by
   Frank Kastenholz of FTP Software and produced by the Ethernet MIB
   Working Group.  RFC 2358 extends those documents by providing support
   for 100 Mb/sec ethernet interfaces as outlined in [17].

   RFC 1643 and RFC 1650, in turn, are based on the Draft Standard
   Ethernet MIB, RFC 1398 [23], also edited by Frank Kastenholz and
   produced by the Ethernet MIB Working Group.

   RFC 1398, in turn, is based on the Proposed Standard Ethernet MIB,
   RFC 1284 [21], which was edited by John Cook of Chipcom and produced
   by the Transmission MIB Working Group.  The Ethernet MIB Working
   Group gathered implementation experience of the variables specified
   in RFC 1284, documented that experience in RFC 1369 [22], and used
   that information to develop this revised MIB.

   RFC 1284, in turn, is based on a document written by Frank
   Kastenholz, then of Interlan, entitled IEEE 802.3 Layer Management
   Draft M compatible MIB for TCP/IP Networks [20].  This document was
   modestly reworked, initially by the SNMP Working Group, and then by
   the Transmission Working Group, to reflect the current conventions
   for defining objects for MIB interfaces.  James Davin, of the MIT
   Laboratory for Computer Science, and Keith McCloghrie of Hughes LAN
   Systems, contributed to later drafts of this memo. Marshall Rose of
   Performance Systems International, Inc. converted the document into
   RFC 1212 [3] concise format. Anil Rijsinghani of DEC contributed text
   that more adequately describes the TDR test.  Thanks to Frank
   Kastenholz of Interlan and Louis Steinberg of IBM for their
   experimentation.

8.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB is
   implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can
   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP
   SET operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may be
   considered to contain sensitive information.  In particular, the
   dot3StatsEtherChipSet object may be considered sensitive in many
   environments, since it would allow an intruder to obtain information
   about which vendor's equipment is in use on the network.

   Therefore, it may be important in some environments to control read
   access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of
   these object when sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all
   versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET (read) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.

A.  Change Log


A.1.  Changes since RFC 2358

   This section enumerates changes made to RFC 2358 to produce this
   document.

      (1)   Section 2 has been replaced with the current SNMP
            Management Framework boilerplate.

      (2)   The ifMtu mapping has been clarified.

      (3)   The relationship between the IEEE 802.3 octet counters
            and the IF-MIB octet counters has been clarified.

      (4)   REFERENCE clauses have been updated to reflect the
            actual IEEE 802.3 managed object that each MIB object
            is based on.

      (5)   The following object DESCRIPTION clauses have been
            updated to reflect that they do not increment in
            full-duplex mode: dot3StatsSingleCollisionFrames,
            dot3StatsMultipleCollisionFrames, dot3StatsSQETestErrors,
            dot3StatsDeferredTransmissions, dot3StatsLateCollisions,
            dot3StatsExcessiveCollisions, dot3StatsCarrierSenseErrors,
            dot3CollFrequencies.

      (6)   The following object DESCRIPTION clauses have been
            updated to reflect behaviour on full-duplex and
            1000 Mb/s interfaces: dot3StatsAlignmentErrors,
            dot3StatsFCSErrors, dot3StatsSQETestErrors,
            dot3StatsLateCollisions, dot3StatsSymbolErrors.

      (7)   A new table, dot3ControlTable, has been added.

      (8)   Two new conformance groups, etherControlGroup and
            etherControlPauseGroup, have been added.


A.2.  Changes between RFC 1650 and RFC 2358

   This section enumerates changes made to RFC 1650 to produce RFC 2358.

      (1)   The MODULE-IDENTITY has been updated to reflect the changes
            in the MIB.

      (2)   A new object, dot3StatsSymbolErrors, has been added.

      (3)   The definition of the object dot3StatsIndex has been
            converted to use the SMIv2 OBJECT-TYPE macro.

      (4)   A new conformance group, etherStats100MbsGroup, has been
            added.

      (5)   A new compliance statement, ether100MbsCompliance, has
            been added.

      (6)   The Acknowledgements were extended to provide a more
            complete history of the origin of this document.

      (7)   The discussion of ifType has been expanded.

      (8)   A section on mapping of Interfaces MIB objects has
            been added.

      (9)   A section defining the relationship of this MIB to
            the MAU MIB has been added.

      (10)  A section on the mapping of IEEE 802.3 managed objects
            to this MIB and the Interfaces MIB has been added.

      (11)  Converted the dot3Tests, dot3Errors, and dot3ChipSets
            OIDs to use the OBJECT-IDENTITY macro.

      (12)  Added to the list of registered dot3ChipSets.

      (13)  An intellectual property notice and copyright notice
            were added, as required by RFC 2026.
