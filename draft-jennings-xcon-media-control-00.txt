Abstract

   Conference mixers have many controls that change how the media is
   combined for each participant in the conference. There is a need to
   describe these to the clients connected to the a centralized
   conference so that the clients can render a user interface and allow
   the user to manipulate them.

   This work is very early and far from complete. This draft sketched
   the outline of a solution for consideration. It is being discussed on
   the xcon@ietf.org mailing list.

1. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].

2. Introduction to the Problem

   This work tries to solve the problem of allowing a conference
   participant to manipulate the media flow in a mixer. It defines a
   protocol between the end user's software manipulating the conference
   and the centralized conference mixer. This needs to be rich enough
   for a mixer to express what information it wants from a mixer yet
   simple enough to allow the client to render a useful user interface
   to the user. This work takes into account that real mixers have
   constraints on what media flows are possible and that UIs have
   buttons, knobs, etc that users manipulate. The goal is for a
   conferencing end point made by one vendor to work with mixers or
   conference systems made by another vendor.

2.1 Non Problems

   There are several topics that are completely internal to the
   conference systems and are out of scope for this this work. These
   include:

      How the focus manipulates the mixer.

      How one describes what a mixer is capable of doing.


3. Overview

   When a conference is created, it is instantiated from a template. The
   template describes what controls are available for the client to
   manipulate the media. The conference also describes roles that the
   client can take on, such as Moderator. The template can have
   parameters that are set when it is instantiated to allow one template
   to describe variations of similar flow models.

   This document describes the templates and ways for the client to
   understand and manipulate the media in the conference. It allows for
   the following:

      A conference consists of several participants and multiple streams
      of media flowing between the participant and the mixer.

      Sidebars are mini conferences that are just like conferences



Jennings & Rosen         Expires August 9, 2004                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            Media Mixer Control              February 2004


      except that a sidebar cannot itself contain sidebars.

      Clients can discover the template chosen for use in a conference,
      and the Values of the parameters set for the conference

      Clients can discover the available streams in a conference.

      Clients can send media on a participant stream and receive media
      and receive media on a mixer stream.

      Clients can discover the Participants in a conference and their
      role (this is more conference policy than media policy).

      Clients can join a conference as a participant and assume a
      particular role.

      Conferences, Streams, and Participants can have controls that
      manipulate the media sent and received.

      The role of the participant will control what view of the
      conference they have and which media streams they can manipulate.


3.1 Semantic information in a Conference

   The conference has a list of Participants. Each Participant has a set
   of Controls That he can manipulate.  Each conference has a list of
   sidebars.  Each conference has a list of Streams.  Each Stream has
   attributes such as name, type, priority and list of contributing
   participants.

3.2 The Protocol

   The protocol between the client and the conference server allows the
   client to get the semantic information in the conference, find out
   when it changes, and make changes to it. It's probably something like
   XCAP. [TODO add ref]

3.3 Templates

   Templates define a model for the reception, manipulation and
   transmission of streams. A template provides enough information that
   the client can intelligently render a useful GUI to the end user to
   manipulate the model. There is a registry of well known templates,
   but a conference server can define new ones. A convener can find all
   the templates a conference server supports and select one to use when
   creating the conference.

Internet-Draft            Media Mixer Control              February 2004


   A template for a very basic audio conference, for example, may
   indicate that there is one audio stream for each participant, and one
   output mixer stream named "primary". Each participant in the stream
   has a single binary control called "Mute".  There is only one Role
   that can be used, called "participant".

3.4 Parameters

   Parameters are variables in the template that are set when the
   conference is created. For example, in the audio conference, the
   maximum number of participants might be a parameter.  If the value
   was set to 10 when the conference is instantiated, then up to 10
   participant streams can be accepted into the mixer.  The template can
   indicate the valid range for max number of participants, perhaps from
   2 to 128.

3.5 Controls

   Controls are variables participants may manipulate to control the
   media streams of the conference. Conferences can have controls,
   participants in a conference can have controls, and streams in a
   conference can have controls. Controls can also be implicitly created
   by stream action, for example a selector control based on the loudest
   speaker.  Controls have a name, and a value.  Controls are defined in
   the template.

3.6 Roles

   Participants in a conference can take on different Roles that change
   what ccontrols they may manipulate.  The template defines what Roles
   are available for the client. The moderator (which itself is a role)
   can change the role of a particular participant.

4. Introductory Example

4.1 Simple Audio

   The client selects the basic audio template that looks like:

   <template name="basic-audio">
        <parameter type="integer" name="max-participants"
                min="2" max="128"/>
        <role name="Participant">
            <stream type="audio" dir="in" name="input[]" priority="1.0">
            </stream>
            <stream type="audio" dir="out" name="mix[]" priority="1.0">
                <control type="boolean" name="mute"/>
            </stream>

Internet-Draft            Media Mixer Control              February 2004


        </role>
   </template>

   The client retrieves this template and uses it to create a conference
   where it sets the max-participants to 10. Alice and Bob join this
   conference and the conference server tells Bob about the state of the
   conference media. There is only one role "participamt".  Each
   participant contributes one input stream. There is also an output
   stream per participant.  There is a single control, called mute, for
   each participant.

   After Alice and Bob have joined, the conference server informs Bob
   that the current state of the conference is as shown in the xml
   below.

   <conference type="basic-audio" name="Weekly Conference">
           <parameter type="integer" name="max-participants"> 10
        </parameter>
           <role name="Participant"/>
           <participant name="Alice" role="Participant">
           <stream type="audio" dir="in" name="input[Alice]"
                url="sip:alice22-audio-primary@cs.example.com"
                priority="1.0"/>
           <stream type="audio" dir="out" name="mix[Alice]"
                url="sip:alice22-audio-primary@cs.example.com"
                priority="1.0">
                   <control type="boolean" name="mute"
                        perm="readonly"> 0 </control>
               </stream>
           </participant>
           <participant name="Bob" role="Participant">
           <stream type="audio" dir="in" name="input[Bob]"
                url="sip:bob5-audio-primary@cs.example.com"
                priority="1.0"/>
           <stream type="audio" dir="out" name="mix[Bob]"
                url="sip:bob5-audio-primary@cs.example.com"
                priority="1.0">
                   <control type="boolean" name="mute"
                        perm="readwrite"> 0 </control>
               </stream>
           </participant>
   </conference>

   There are two participants, Alice and Bob, who both contribute input
   streams and receive Mix streams and neither is muted.

   Bob's client decides to change the Mute state for its audio stream
   and sends the following to the conference server to change the state



Jennings & Rosen         Expires August 9, 2004                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            Media Mixer Control              February 2004


   of the conference.

   <conference type="basic-audio" name="Weekly Conference">
           <stream type="audio" dir = "out" name="mix[Bob]">
                    <control type="Boolean" name="mute"> 1
                    </control>
           </stream>
   </conference>

   A key part of this is that Bob's client may have known about this
   basic audio template and what the semantics of the "mute" control
   implied. The client may have connected this up with a button of the
   client's that was labeled mute. On the other hand, Bob's client may
   not have known anything about this template and simply rendered a
   button on the screen and labeled it "mute" with no idea what this
   would do. A third client may not have been table to deal with the
   control at all and may have just ignored it. Clearly the user
   interface can be better if the client understands the semantics of
   what the template means, but the user interface is still functional
   when the client does not.

5. Names and terminology

5.1 Templates

   Templates contain a list of stream, roles for participants,
   parameters that need to be set, and controls for the conference.

5.2 Participants

   Participants are the logical user entities participating in a
   conference.

5.3 Streams

   The stream is a named stream of media. An example is a simple audio
   conference with 6 participants and a mixer that mixes the loudest
   three. Each participant contributes an input stream.  There is a
   single logical output stream, but every participant gets a "custom"
   version of this stream, because, in normal mixers, each participants
   can hear all inputs except his own.  This is commonly referred to as
   "mix-minus".  If the output steam also has a control (mute), the
   output streams for each participant may also vary depending on the
   state of the control.

   Streams all have a type, a name, a direction (in or out), one or more
   URLs, and a priority. The URL is the source or sink of the stream.
   The priority indicates how important this particular stream is to the



Jennings & Rosen         Expires August 9, 2004                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            Media Mixer Control              February 2004


   conference and the type indicates the type of media carried in this
   steam.

   Streams have types.  These correspond to the major MIME types of the
   media they send.

5.3.1 Stream Types

5.3.1.1 Audio

   Streams originate as participant contributions (dir="in") that are
   mixed using some kind of algorithm.  Intermediate streams may be
   created, which are subsequently mixed with other streams yielding
   streams which are sent to participants (dir="out").  Controls
   commonly available on audio streams include input or output faders
   (volume controls), stereo balance, and mute.

5.3.1.2 Video

   Streams originate as participant contributions (dir="in") that are
   combined with some kind of algorithm.  Intermediate streams may be
   created, which are subsequently combined with other streams yielding
   streams which are sent to participants (dir="out").  Controls
   commonly available on video streams might include selectors for
   choosing a tiling format, selectors which input streams appear on
   output tiles, and video mutes.

5.3.1.3 Text

   Streams originate as participant contributions (dir="in") (Instant
   Messages). Messages from all participants are combined using some
   algorithm.  Intermediate streams may be created, which are
   subsequently combined with other text streams yielding streams which
   are sent to participants (dir="out").

5.3.1.4 Application

   At a minimal level, this consist of a URL that defines the
   application. Many systems will simply update an http URL that fetches
   an HTML page that shows the current presentation.

5.3.2 Stream URLs

   Streams have URLs that specify the source or sink of the stream.
   These would typically be a SIP, H323 or XMPP URL.

5.3.3 Stream Priority

Internet-Draft            Media Mixer Control              February 2004


   Streams have a priority from 0 to 1. Zero indicates that a client, by
   default, should not play/display this stream unless the user
   specifically requests it. A priority of 1 indicates that, by default,
   the client should render this stream and should warn the user if it
   cannot. Other values only define an ordering, and clients should
   attempt to use their resources to display the higher priority streams
   before the lower.

5.4 Roles

   Roles are defined as part of Conference Policy but are used here so
   that the Media Policy can define separate streams and controls
   depending on role. Roles are defined by in the template.  Some
   templates may allow a participant to take on more than one role at a
   time.  Each template must define a role named "participant", which is
   the default role.  "Moderator" is a typical role, as is
   "Floor-Holder", but templates do not intrinsically define or require
   such roles.

5.5 Controls

   Controls manipulate the state of the conference while it is
   instantiated. All controls have a name, a type, a current value and
   permissions that indicate whether or not the current client can
   modify them. They may also have, optionally, a min and max value.

   A control can be defined as being part of a role.  In that case, all
   participants who assume that role have an instance of the control. A
   control may also be defined as part of a stream, in which case all
   contributors of that stream (dir="in") have an instance of the
   control, or all sinks of the stream (dir="out") have an instance of
   the control.  There can be global controls, which are available to
   all participants.  Implicit controls extract values from streams (or
   other controls), such as choosing video inputs based on loudest
   speakers

5.6 Parameters

   Parameters are variables that modify the function of the template.
   They are fixed when the conference is instantiated.  Parameters allow
   a single template definition to describe a range of possible mixer
   capabilities.

   Parameters have a name, a type, a value and, optionally, a mix and
   max value.

6.1 Templates

   A template is an xml document.  The template definition includes a
   name, which is a string, for example:

   <template name="audio-basic">

6.1.1 Parameters

   The parameters in the templates customize a generic template for a
   specific conference.  Parameters have name, type, value, and
   optionally min/max.  Parameters are defined in the template
   description.  Only conveners can set template parameters

   One typical template parameter is "max-participants". When the CS
   generates the template for the client, it can customize the min and
   max value of this parameter to match what it is capable of. When the
   client instantiates the template and creates the conference, it can
   specify the value that has been requested. The value typically
   represents the limits the mixer is capable of. Resource availability
   may limit the actual value that can be achieved.

   Parameter names are strings.

   Parameter Types:

      Integer

      Real

      Enumeration

      String

   Values of course must be conformant to the type.  Min and Max, if
   defined, must also be conformant to the declared type.

   Example:

   <parameter name="Master Volume", type="integer", min="0",
   max="100">75</parameter>

6.1.2 Roles

   Templates define all the Roles that a participant can take and
   (optionally) the max number of participants of each role.  Each role
   is defined in a role element.  A Role element includes a name and
   optionally a "max-participants" value.  Role elements may also

   contain stream elements, which define per-participant-in-role
   streams.

   Example:

   <role name="moderator" max-participants="1" />

6.1.3 Streams

   Templates also define all the streams available. A stream element has
   a name, a type, a direction ("in" or "out"), priority and URL.
   Certain streams may actually be a set of streams, for example, one
   per participant.  A specific member of the set can be referenced
   using an array notation with square brackets.  For example, if an
   input stream is available named foo, and there is a participant named
   "Bob", then foo["Bob"] would be the name of the foo stream Bob
   contributes. If a stream is defined within a role element, the stream
   is a set of streams, one per participant in the role.  If a stream is
   defined in more than one role with the same name, the stream set is
   the same, and participants in any roles that have that stream defined
   with that name contribute/sink a stream to the set.

   The URL is typically not given a value in the template definition.
   The mixer assigns URL values as participants assume roles.  Most
   implementations would not allow the URL to be changed by the media
   policy mechanism.  The value of the URL would be included in the
   media policy conference state document.

   Example:

   <stream name="input-audio" type="audio" dir="in" priority="1.0" >

6.1.4 Controls

   A control can be inside the template, participant, or stream. The
   control will apply to the appropriate context. By including stream
   definitions in multiple roles that have the same name, different
   controls can be provided to different roles affecting streams
   contributed or sunk from multiple roles.  For example, a moderator
   may be given a set of input volume controls controlling a mix, and
   every participant can be given an output master mix control for the
   output stream sent to him

6.1.5 Conference State

   Conference state can be requested by any participant.  A document
   will be returned elucidating the complete current conference state,
   which would contain all the participants, all the streams, and the

   values of all the controls. The form of the document mirrors the
   template definition.  The conference can also contain sidebars.

6.1.5.1 Conference State Update

   The client can attempt to change the state of various controls in the
   CS by sending a document that contains just the things it wants to
   change.

6.1.5.2 Change Notification

   The client can request that conference state be automatically sent
   when it changes.

6.1.6 Transport Protocol

   TODO: Need to define how the information is sent between the client
   and the conference server. XCAP?

6.2 Controls

6.2.1 Requirements

   Controls need to collect information. This can be classified into
   several types. It should be possible to provide default values, a
   name for the control and text it displays, help text, control if a
   value is required, and control of whether or not the value is
   editable. It should be possible to express constraints on the form an
   input can take by specifying a minimum or maximum for types where
   that makes sense, or specifying a regular expression that must be
   satisfied. For numeric values in a constrained range, it should be
   possible to provide an increment value used by the control. For
   strings it should be possible to indicate that they should not be
   displayed when they are entered for things like passwords. Need the
   ability to internationalize any text that is displayed to the user.

   There are control types for:

      Strings

      Multi-line Strings

      Integer

      Real

      Boolean

      Date

      Time

      Date Time

      URI

      File Selection

      Select Single

      Select Multiple

   If an unknown control is encountered, it should be treated as a
   string type. The <label> element controls what is displayed to the
   user and the <value> element contains the current setting of the
   control. If set in the template definition, it represents the default
   value.  An optional <description> element provides some text that can
   be used as help text for the control.

6.2.2 Strings

   This is typically rendered as a text input field.

   <control type="string" name="Host" private="true" >
      <label> Meeting Host </label>
      <value>Richard</value>
      <description>Host for this weeks meeting</description>
      <regex>.*[rR].*</regex>
   </control>

   The "private" attribute indicates that the string should not be
   displayed as it is entered.

6.2.3 Integer

   This can be rendered as a slider or volume knob if it has a
   constrained range; otherwise it is a text field. The text field may
   have increment or decrement buttons.

           <control type="integer" name="gain">
                   <label> Volume </label>
                   <value>0</value>
                   <range min="-18" max="6" increment="3"/>
           </control>

Internet-Draft            Media Mixer Control              February 2004


6.2.4 Boolean

   This is typically rendered as a toggle button.

           <control type="boolean" name="mute">
                   <label> Mute </label>
                   <value>True</value>
           </control>


6.2.5 Selection

   This is typically rendered as a pull down menu or as a radio button
   box.

           <control type="select1" name="foo">
                   <label> the thing </label>
                   <value>2</value>
                   <item>
                           <label>one</label>
                           <value>1</value>
                   </item>
                   <item>
                           <label>two</label>
                           <value>2</value>
                   </item>
           </control>

   The list of items that can be selected is contained in <item>
   elements. Each item has a label that is displayed and a value that is
   returned when it is selected.

6.2.6 Multiple Selection

   This is typically rendered as a combo box or list.

   This is the same as a selection, except that the type is selected and
   the initial value is a space-separated list of values.

6.2.7 Frame

   Provides a hint to groups of controls.  Uis are NOT constrained to
   follow the frame construct.

   <frame name="Address">
      <control type="string" name="addr" private="true" >
        <label> Street Address </label>
        <regex>.*[rR].*</regex>

7. Examples

7.1 Audio Video Presentation

   The following is a more complex template with bits of text explaining
   it:

   In this template, there are three roles, Participant, Presenter and
   Moderator.  There is an input and output audio stream for each role.
   All roles have mute and master volume controls for their outputs.
   The moderator has input controls for each input.

   The video presentation is "Hollywood Squares".  Each role contributes
   one video stream.  The moderator can select the presentation (tile
   format) from an enumeration.  All viewers see the same output
   presentation.

   Finally, there is an application sharing channel which is provided by
   the Presenter, and received by all roles.

   <template name="audio-video-presentation">
      <parameter type="integer" name="max-participants"
                  min="2" max="16"/>

            <parameter type="integer" name="max-participants"
