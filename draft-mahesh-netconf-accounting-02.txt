1.  Introduction

   NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040] protocol operations are
   authenticated and authorized as part of the Authentication,
   Authorization and Accounting (AAA) framework.  An accounting record
   is generated as part of the same framework for each of these
   operations to satisfy the accounting part of AAA, but there has been
   no effort to define such a record.  Having an accounting record that
   is consistent across vendors allows for the operator to compare
   operations across devices from different vendors.  This document
   defines such a record and a corresponding YANG data model (ietf-
   netconf-am.yang).

   The rest of this document will use NETCONF to imply both NETCONF and
   RESTCONF, but where applicable will call out each protocol
   specifically.

1.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in NETCONF [RFC6241] and are not
   redefined here:

   o  client

   o  server

   o  session

Internet-Draft       NETCONF and RESTCONF Accounting           June 2017


   o  user

   o  <get>

   o  notification

1.2.  Compatability with remote AAA servers

   This document does not cover how the server interacts with remote AAA
   servers and any interaction is out of scope of this document.  A
   particular implementation can make the records available as part of
   <get> request, send a notification every time a accounting record is
   generated or use any existing protocol to update the remote AAA
   server.

2.  Accounting Record

   An accounting record for NETCONF consists of the following fields.
   Note, there is no accounting record for reading or notification of an
   accounting record.

   +------+------+-----+------+----+-----+----+----+------+-----+------+
   | mess | sess | src | date | us | gro | pa | va | acti | rul | stat |
   | age- | ion- | -ip | -    | er | ups | th | lu | on   | e   | us   |
   | id   | id   |     | time |    |     |    | e  |      |     |      |
   +------+------+-----+------+----+-----+----+----+------+-----+------+
   +------+------+-----+------+----+-----+----+----+------+-----+------+

   where:

   message-id: This is the id within a given NETCONF session assigned to
   each RPC.  RESTCONF has no concept of a session, so this field would
   be left blank.

   session-id: The session-id in case of NETCONF and would be blank in
   case of RESTCONF.  If the accounting record needs to be fragmented
   for any reason, it is suggested that this field not be repeated in
   subsequent packets.  Instead a combination of start and end record
   marker, and the message-id should be used to reassemble fragmented
   records.

   src-ip: The source IP address that was used to request the operation.
   If the accounting record needs to be fragmented for any reason, it is
   suggested that this field not be repeated in subsequent packets.
   Instead a combination of start and end record marker, and the
   message-id should be used to reassemble fragmented records.

Internet-Draft       NETCONF and RESTCONF Accounting           June 2017


   date-time: The date and time when the operation was performed (UTC
   Timezone).  If the accounting record needs to be fragmented for any
   reason, it is suggested that this field not be repeated in subsequent
   packets.  Instead a combination of start and end record marker, and
   the message-id should be used to reassemble fragmented records.

   user: The NETCONF user that requesed this operation.  If the
   accounting record needs to be fragmented for any reason, it is
   suggested that this field not be repeated in subsequent packets.
   Instead a combination of start and end record marker, and the
   message-id should be used to reassemble fragmented records.

   groups: The group the user belongs to.  If the accounting record
   needs to be fragmented for any reason, it is suggested that this
   field not be repeated in subsequent packets.  Instead a combination
   of start and end record marker, and the message-id should be used to
   reassemble fragmented records.

   path: The path in the NACM [RFC6536] rule on which the operations is
   being performed

   value: The value that was set for any of the attributes in the
   request

   action: The action in the NACM [RFC6536] rule

   rule: The rule in the NACM [RFC6536] that was used to authorize the
   action.

   status: Whether the operations was permitted or denied.

3.  Data Model Definitions

   The model uses the NACM extension statement of default-deny-all to
   protect accounting records.  Explicit rules have to be defined to be
   enable access to the accounting records.

3.1.  Data Organization

   The following diagram highlights the contents and structure of the
   Accounting YANG module.  For information on annotations, please refer

   The following YANG module specifies the normative NETCONF content
   that MUST be supported by the server.

   The "ietf-netconf-am" YANG module imports typedefs from YANG-TYPES
   [RFC6991], from NETCONF [RFC6241] and from NACM [RFC6536].

<CODE BEGINS> file "ietf-netconf-am@2017-06-29.yang"

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes two requests of IANA.

   The first request is to register one URI in "The IETF XML Registry".
   Following the format in The IETF XML Registry [RFC3688], the
   following needs to be registered.

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-am

   Registrant Contact: The IESG

   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace

   The second request is to register one module in the "YANG Module
   Names" registry.  Following the format in YANG [RFC7950], the
   following needs to be registered.

   Name: ietf-netconf-am

   Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-am

   Prefix: nam

   Reference: RFC XXXX

   Note to RFC Editor - Please replace XXXX here and in the rest of the
   draft with the RFC id assigned to this draft.

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocol such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF
   [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer,
   and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH)
   [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layers is HTTPS, and the mandatory-
   to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC6536] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a pre-
   configured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   Most of the data nodes defined in this YANG module are readonly, i.e.
   config false, and are therefore not vulnerable to manipulation in
   network environments.  However, they might contain data that might be
   sensitive and should be protected with the right NACM [RFC6536]
   rules.
