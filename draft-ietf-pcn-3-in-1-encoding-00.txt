   The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the
   quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain.

Internet-Draft             3-in-1 PCN Encoding                 July 2009


   The overall rate of the PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the
   PCN-domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain
   configured rates are exceeded.  The level of marking allows the
   boundary nodes to make decisions about whether to admit or block a
   new flow request, and (in abnormal circumstances) whether to
   terminate some of the existing flows, thereby protecting the QoS of
   previously admitted flows.  This document specifies how such marks
   are to be encoded into the IP header by re-using the Explicit
   Congestion Notification (ECN) codepoints within this controlled
   domain.  This encoding builds on the baseline encoding and provides
   for three PCN encoding states: Not-marked, Threshold-marked and
   Excess-traffic-marked.


1.  Introduction

   The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) [RFC5559] is to
   protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a
   Diffserv domain, in a simple, scalable, and robust fashion.  Two
   mechanisms are used: admission control, to decide whether to admit or
   block a new flow request, and (in abnormal circumstances) flow
   termination to decide whether to terminate some of the existing
   flows.  To achieve this, the overall rate of PCN-traffic is metered
   on every link in the domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked
   when certain configured rates are exceeded.  These configured rates
   are below the rate of the link thus providing notification to
   boundary nodes about overloads before any congestion occurs (hence
   "pre-congestion notification").

   The level of marking allows boundary nodes to make decisions about
   whether to admit or terminate.  This is achieved by marking packets
   on interior nodes according to some metering function implemented at
   each node.  Excess-traffic-marking marks PCN packets that exceed a
   certain reference rate on a link while threshold marking marks all
   PCN packets on a link when the PCN traffic rate exceeds a higher
   reference rate [I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour].  These marks are
   monitored by the egress nodes of the PCN domain.

   To fully support these two types of marking, three encoding states
   are needed.  The baseline encoding described in
   [I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding] provides for deployment scenarios
   that only require two PCN encoding states using a single Diffserv
   codepoint.  This document describes an experimental extension to the
   baseline-encoding that adds a third PCN encoding state in the IP
   header, still using a single Diffserv codepoint.  For brevity it will
   be called the 3-in-1 PCN Encoding.

   General PCN-related terminology is defined in the PCN architecture

   [RFC5559], and terminology specific to packet encoding is defined in
   the PCN baseline encoding [I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding].  Note
   that [I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding] requires the PCN Working Group
   to maintain a list of all DSCPs used for PCN experiments.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  The Requirement for Three PCN Encoding States

   The PCN architecture [RFC5559] describes proposed PCN schemes that
   expect traffic to be metered and marked using both Threshold and
   Excess Traffic schemes.  In order to achieve this it is necessary to
   allow for three PCN encoding states: one as a Not Marked (NM) state
   and the other two to distinguish these two levels of marking severity
   [I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour].  The way tunnels process the ECN
   field severely limits how to encode these states.

   The two bit ECN field seems to offer four possible encoding states,
   but one (00) is set aside for traffic controlled by transports that
   do not understand PCN marking [I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding], so it
   would be irregular and risky to use it as a PCN encoding state.  Of
   the three remaining ECN codepoints, only one (11) can be introduced
   by a congested node within a tunnel and still survive the
   decapsulation behaviour of a tunnel egress as currently standardised.
   The two remaining codepoints are (10) and (01).  But if a node within
   the tunnel used either of these two remaining codepoints to try to

Internet-Draft             3-in-1 PCN Encoding                 July 2009


   mark packets with a second severity level, this marking would be
   removed on decapsulation.  The ECN field is constrained to two
   marking states in this way irrespective of whether regular IP in IP
   tunnelling [RFC3168] or IPsec tunnelling [RFC4301] is used.

   One way to provide another encoding state that survives tunnelling is
   to use a second Diffserv codepoint [I-D.ietf-pcn-3-state-encoding].
   Instead, to avoid wasting scarce Diffserv codepoints, we could modify
   standard tunnels in the PCN region to remove the constraints imposed
   by standard tunnelling.

   Therefore this document presupposes tunnels in the PCN region comply
   with the newly proposed decapsulation rules defined in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel].  Then the constraints of standard
   tunnels no longer apply so this document can define a 3-state
   encoding for PCN within one Diffserv codepoint.


4.  The 3-in-1 PCN Encoding

   The 3-in-1 PCN Encoding scheme is based closely on that defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding] so that there will be no
   compatibility issues if a PCN-domain evolves from using the baseline
   encoding scheme to the experimental scheme described here.  The exact
   manner in which the PCN encoding states are carried in the IP header
   is shown in Table 1.

                    Codepoint in ECN field of IP header
                         <RFC3168 codepoint name>

      +--------+--------------+-------------+-------------+---------+
      |  DSCP  | 00 <Not-ECT> | 10 <ECT(0)> | 01 <ECT(1)> | 11 <CE> |
      +--------+--------------+-------------+-------------+---------+
      | DSCP n |    Not-PCN   |      NM     |     ThM     |   ETM   |
      +--------+--------------+-------------+-------------+---------+

                       Table 1: 3-in-1 PCN Encoding

   In Table 1 the 3 PCN states are encoded in the ECN field ([RFC3168])
   of an IP packet with its Diffserv field ([RFC2474]) set to DSCP n,
   which is any PCN-Compatible DiffServ codepoint as defined in Section
   4.2 of the PCN baseline encoding [I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding]).
   The PCN codepoint of a packet defines its marking state as follows:

   Not-PCN:  The packet is controlled by a transport that does not
      understand PCN marking, therefore the only valid action to notify
      congestion is to drop the packet;

Internet-Draft             3-in-1 PCN Encoding                 July 2009


   NM:  Not marked.  A packet in the NM state has not (yet) had its
      marking state changed to the ThM or ETM states, but it may be
      changed to one of these states by a node experiencing congestion
      or pre-congestion;

   ThM:  Threshold-marked.  Such a packet has had its marking state
      changed by the threshold-meter function
      [I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour];

   ETM:  Excess-traffic-marked.  Such a packet has had its marking state
      changed by the excess-traffic-meter function
      [I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour].

   Packets marked NM, ThM or ETM are termed PCN-packets because their
   entry into the pcn-domain is controlled by edge nodes that understand
   how to process PCN markings.


5.  Behaviour of a PCN Node Compliant with the 3-in-1 PCN Encoding

   To be compliant with the 3-in-1 PCN Encoding, an PCN interior node
   behaves as follows:

   o  Except where explicitly stated otherwise, it MUST comply with
      [I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding]

   o  It MUST change NM TO ThM if the threshold-meter function indicates
      to mark the packet.

   o  It MUST change NM or ThM TO ETM if the excess-traffic-meter
      function indicates to mark the packet.

   o  It MUST NOT change Not-PCN to a PCN-Enabled codepoint and MUST NOT
      change a PCN-Enabled codepoint to Not-PCN;

   o  It MUST NOT change ThM to NM;

   o  It MUST NOT change ETM to ThM or to NM;

   In other words, a PCN interior node may increase the severity of
   packet marking but it MUST NOT decrease it, where the order of
   severity increases from NM through ThM to ETM.


6.  IANA Considerations

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


7.  Security Considerations

   The security concerns relating to this extended PCN encoding are
   essentially the same as those in [I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding].


8.  Conclusions

   The 3-in-1 PCN Encoding provides three states to encode PCN markings
   in the ECN field of an IP packet using just one Diffserv codepoint.
   One state is for not marked packets while the two others are for PCN
   nodes to mark packets with increasing levels of severity.  Use of
   this encoding presupposes that any tunnels in the PCN region have
   been updated to comply with [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel].
