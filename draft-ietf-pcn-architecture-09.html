Introduction</h3>

<p>The purpose of this document is to describe a general architecture
      for flow admission and termination based on (pre-) congestion
      information in order to protect the quality of service of flows within a
      DiffServ domain <a class='info' href='#RFC2475'>[RFC2475]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Blake, S., Black, D., Carlson, M., Davies, E., Wang, Z., and W. Weiss, &ldquo;An Architecture for Differentiated Services,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>. This document defines an
      architecture for implementing two mechanisms to protect the quality of
      service of established inelastic flows within a single DiffServ domain,
      where all boundary and interior nodes are PCN-enabled and are trusted
      for correct PCN operation. Flow admission control determines whether a
      new flow should be admitted, in order to protect the QoS of existing
      PCN-flows in normal circumstances. However, in abnormal circumstances,
      for instance a disaster affecting multiple nodes and causing traffic
      re-routes, then the QoS on existing PCN-flows may degrade even though
      care was exercised when admitting those flows. Therefore this document
      also describes a mechanism for flow termination, which removes enough
      traffic in order to protect the QoS of the remaining PCN-flows.
</p>
<p>As a fundamental building block to enable these two mechanisms,
      PCN-interior-nodes generate, encode and transport pre-congestion
      information towards the PCN-egress-nodes. Two rates, a
      PCN-threshold-rate and a PCN-excess-rate, are associated with each link
      of the PCN-domain. Each rate is used by a marking behaviour that
      determines how and when PCN-packets are marked, and how the markings are
      encoded in packet headers. Overall the aim is to enable PCN-nodes to
      give an "early warning" of potential congestion before there is any
      significant build-up of PCN-packets in the queue.
</p>
<p>PCN-boundary-nodes convert measurements of these PCN-markings into
      decisions about flow admission and termination. In a PCN-domain with
      both threshold marking and excess traffic marking enabled, then the
      admission control mechanism limits the PCN-traffic on each link to
      *roughly* its PCN-threshold-rate and the flow termination mechanism
      limits the PCN-traffic on each link to *roughly* its PCN-excess-rate.
      Other scenarios are discussed later.
</p>
<p>The behaviour of PCN-interior-nodes is standardised in other
      documents, which are summarised in this document:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Marking behaviour: threshold marking and excess traffic marking
          <a class='info' href='#PCN08-2'>[PCN08&#8209;2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Marking behaviour of PCN-nodes (work in progress),&rdquo; Oct&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. Threshold marking marks all
          PCN-packets if the PCN traffic rate is greater than a first
          configured rate, "PCN-threshold-rate". Excess traffic marking marks
          a proportion of PCN-packets, such that the amount marked equals the
          traffic rate in excess of a second configured rate,
          "PCN-excess-rate".
</li>
<li>Encoding: a combination of the DSCP field and ECN field in the IP
          header indicates that a packet is a PCN-packet and whether it is
          PCN-marked. The "baseline" encoding is described in <a class='info' href='#PCN08-1'>[PCN08&#8209;1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Baseline Encoding and Transport of Pre-Congestion           Information,&rdquo; Oct&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, which standardises two PCN encoding states
          (PCN-marked and not PCN-marked), whilst (experimental) extensions to
          the baseline encoding can provide three encoding states
          (threshold-marked, excess-traffic-marked, not PCN-marked, or perhaps
          further encoding states as suggested in <a class='info' href='#Westberg08'>[Westberg08]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;LC-PCN: The Load Control PCN Solution (work in           progress),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>). PCN encoding therefore defines
          semantics for the ECN field different from the default semantics of
          <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>, and so its encoding needs to meet
          the guidelines of BCP 124 <a class='info' href='#RFC4774'>[RFC4774]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Floyd, S., &ldquo;Specifying Alternate Semantics for the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Field,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The behaviour of PCN-boundary-nodes is described in Informational
      documents. Several possibilities are outlined in this document; detailed
      descriptions and comparisons are in <a class='info' href='#Charny07-1'>[Charny07&#8209;1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Comparison of Proposed PCN Approaches (work in           progress),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>
      and <a class='info' href='#Menth08-3'>[Menth08&#8209;3]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;PCN-Based Admission Control and Flow Termination,&rdquo; 2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>This document describes the PCN architecture at a high level (Section
      6) and in more detail (Section 7). It also defines some terminology and
      outlines some benefits, deployment scenarios, and assumptions of PCN
      (Sections 2-5). Finally it outlines some challenges, operations and
      management, and security considerations, and some potential future work
      items (Sections 8, 9, 11 and Appendix).

Terminology</h3>

<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>PCN-domain: a PCN-capable domain; a contiguous set of PCN-enabled
          nodes that perform DiffServ scheduling <a class='info' href='#RFC2474'>[RFC2474]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nichols, K., Blake, S., Baker, F., and D. Black, &ldquo;Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>; the complete set of PCN-nodes whose
          PCN-marking can in principle influence decisions about flow
          admission and termination for the PCN-domain, including the
          PCN-egress-nodes, which measure these PCN-marks.
</li>
<li>PCN-boundary-node: a PCN-node that connects one PCN-domain to a
          node either in another PCN-domain or in a non PCN-domain.
</li>
<li>PCN-interior-node: a node in a PCN-domain that is not a
          PCN-boundary-node.
</li>
<li>PCN-node: a PCN-boundary-node or a PCN-interior-node
</li>
<li>PCN-egress-node: a PCN-boundary-node in its role in handling
          traffic as it leaves a PCN-domain.
</li>
<li>PCN-ingress-node: a PCN-boundary-node in its role in handling
          traffic as it enters a PCN-domain.
</li>
<li>PCN-traffic, PCN-packets, PCN-BA: a PCN-domain carries traffic of
          different DiffServ behaviour aggregates (BAs) <a class='info' href='#RFC2474'>[RFC2474]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nichols, K., Blake, S., Baker, F., and D. Black, &ldquo;Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>. The PCN-BA uses the PCN mechanisms to
          carry PCN-traffic and the corresponding packets are PCN-packets. The
          same network will carry traffic of other DiffServ BAs. The PCN-BA is
          distinguished by a combination of the DiffServ codepoint (DSCP) and
          ECN fields.
</li>
<li>PCN-flow: the unit of PCN-traffic that the PCN-boundary-node
          admits (or terminates); the unit could be a single microflow (as
          defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC2474'>[RFC2474]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nichols, K., Blake, S., Baker, F., and D. Black, &ldquo;Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>) or some identifiable
          collection of microflows.
</li>
<li>Ingress-egress-aggregate: The collection of PCN-packets from all
          PCN-flows that travel in one direction between a specific pair of
          PCN-boundary-nodes.
</li>
<li>PCN-threshold-rate: a reference rate configured for each link in
          the PCN-domain, which is lower than the PCN-excess-rate. It is used
          by a marking behaviour that determines whether a packet should be
          PCN-marked with a first encoding, "threshold-marked".
</li>
<li>PCN-excess-rate: a reference rate configured for each link in the
          PCN-domain, which is higher than the PCN-threshold-rate. It is used
          by a marking behaviour that determines whether a packet should be
          PCN-marked with a second encoding, "excess-traffic-marked".
</li>
<li>Threshold-marking: a PCN-marking behaviour with the objective
          that all PCN-traffic is marked if the PCN-traffic exceeds the
          PCN-threshold-rate.
</li>
<li>Excess-traffic-marking: a PCN-marking behaviour with the
          objective that the amount of PCN-traffic that is PCN-marked is equal
          to the amount that exceeds the PCN-excess-rate.
</li>
<li>Pre-congestion: a condition of a link within a PCN-domain such
          that the PCN-node performs PCN-marking, in order to provide an
          "early warning" of potential congestion before there is any
          significant build-up of PCN-packets in the real queue. (Hence, by
          analogy with ECN we call our mechanism Pre-Congestion
          Notification.)
</li>
<li>PCN-marking: the process of setting the header in a PCN-packet
          based on defined rules, in reaction to pre-congestion; either
          threshold-marking or excess-traffic-marking.
</li>
<li>PCN-colouring: the process of setting the header in a PCN-packet
          by a PCN-boundary-node; performed by a PCN-ingress-node so that
          PCN-nodes can easily identify PCN-packets; performed by a
          PCN-egress-node so that the header is appropriate for nodes beyond
          the PCN-domain.
</li>
<li>PCN-feedback-information: information signalled by a
          PCN-egress-node to a PCN-ingress-node (or a central control node),
          which is needed for the flow admission and flow termination
          mechanisms.
</li>
<li>PCN-admissible-rate: the rate of PCN-traffic on a link up to
          which PCN admission control should accept new PCN-flows.
</li>
<li>PCN-supportable-rate: the rate of PCN-traffic on a link down to
          which PCN flow termination should, if necessary, terminate already
          admitted PCN-flows.
</li>

Benefits</h3>

<p>We believe that the key benefits of the PCN mechanisms described in
      this document are that they are simple, scalable, and robust because:
      </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Per flow state is only required at the PCN-ingress-nodes
          ("stateless core"). This is required for policing purposes (to
          prevent non-admitted PCN traffic from entering the PCN-domain) and
          so on. It is not generally required that other network entities are
          aware of individual flows (although they may be in particular
          deployment scenarios).
</li>
<li>Admission control is resilient: with PCN QoS is decoupled from
          the routing system. Hence in general admitted flows can survive
          capacity, routing or topology changes without additional signalling.
          The PCN-admissible-rate on each link can be chosen small enough that
          admitted traffic can still be carried after a rerouting in most
          failure cases <a class='info' href='#Menth07'>[Menth07]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;PCN-Based Resilient Network Admission Control: The Impact of           a Single Bit&quot;,&rdquo; 2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. This is an important
          feature as QoS violations in core networks due to link failures are
          more likely than QoS violations due to increased traffic volume
          <a class='info' href='#Iyer03'>[Iyer03]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;An approach to alleviate link overload as observed on an IP           backbone,&rdquo; 2003.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>The PCN-marking behaviours only operate on the overall
          PCN-traffic on the link, not per flow.
</li>
<li>The information of these measurements is signalled to the
          PCN-egress-nodes by the PCN-marks in the packet headers, ie <a class='info' href='#Style'>[Style]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Guardian Style,&rdquo; 2007.</span><span>)</span></a> "in-band". No additional signalling protocol
          is required for transporting the PCN-marks. Therefore no secure
          binding is required between data packets and separate congestion
          messages.
</li>
<li>The PCN-egress-nodes make separate measurements, operating on the
          aggregate PCN-traffic from each PCN-ingress-node, ie not per flow.
          Similarly, signalling by the PCN-egress-node of
          PCN-feedback-information (which is used for flow admission and
          termination decisions) is at the granularity of the
          ingress-egress-aggregate. An alternative approach is that the
          PCN-egress-nodes monitor the PCN-traffic and signal
          PCN-feedback-information (which is used for flow admission and
          termination decisions) at the granularity of one (or a few)
          PCN-marks.
</li>
<li>The admitted PCN-load is controlled dynamically. Therefore it
          adapts as the traffic matrix changes, and also if the network
          topology changes (eg after a link failure). Hence an operator can be
          less conservative when deploying network capacity, and less accurate
          in their prediction of the PCN-traffic matrix.
</li>
<li>The termination mechanism complements admission control. It
          allows the network to recover from sudden unexpected surges of
          PCN-traffic on some links, thus restoring QoS to the remaining
          flows. Such scenarios are expected to be rare but not impossible.
          They can be caused by large network failures that redirect lots of
          admitted PCN-traffic to other links, or by malfunction of the
          measurement-based admission control in the presence of admitted
          flows that send for a while with an atypically low rate and then
          increase their rates in a correlated way.
</li>
<li>Flow termination can also enable an operator to be less
          conservative when deploying network capacity. It is an alternative
          to running links at low utilisation in order to protect against link
          or node failures. This is especially the case with SRLGs (shared
          risk link groups, which are links that share a resource, such as a
          fibre, whose failure affects all those links <a class='info' href='#RFC4216'>[RFC4216]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Zhang, R. and J. Vasseur, &ldquo;MPLS Inter-Autonomous System (AS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Requirements,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>). Fully protecting traffic against a single
          SRLG failure requires low utilisation (~10%) of the link bandwidth
          on some links before failure <a class='info' href='#Charny08'>[Charny08]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Email to PCN WG mailing list,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>The PCN-supportable-rate may be set below the maximum rate that
          PCN-traffic can be transmitted on a link, in order to trigger
          termination of some PCN-flows before loss (or excessive delay) of
          PCN-packets occurs, or to keep the maximum PCN-load on a link below
          a level configured by the operator.
</li>
<li>Provisioning of the network is decoupled from the process of
          adding new customers. By contrast, with the DiffServ architecture
          <a class='info' href='#RFC2475'>[RFC2475]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Blake, S., Black, D., Carlson, M., Davies, E., Wang, Z., and W. Weiss, &ldquo;An Architecture for Differentiated Services,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> operators rely on subscription-time
          Service Level Agreements, which statically define the parameters of
          the traffic that will be accepted from a customer, and so the
          operator has to verify provision is sufficient each time a new
          customer is added to check that the Service Level Agreement can be
          fulfilled. A PCN-domain doesn't need such traffic conditioning.
</li>
</ul>

Deployment scenarios</h3>

<p>Operators of networks will want to use the PCN mechanisms in various
      arrangements, for instance depending on how they are performing
      admission control outside the PCN-domain (users after all are concerned
      about QoS end-to-end), what their particular goals and assumptions are,
      how many PCN encoding states are available, and so on.
</p>
<p>From the perspective of the outside world, a PCN-domain essentially
      looks like a DiffServ domain. PCN-traffic is either transported across
      it transparently or policed at the PCN-ingress-node (ie dropped or
      carried at a lower QoS). One difference is that PCN-traffic has better
      QoS guarantees than normal DiffServ traffic, because the PCN mechanisms
      better protect the QoS of admitted flows. Another difference may occur
      in the rare circumstance when there is a failure: on the one hand some
      PCN-flows may get terminated, but on the other hand other flows will get
      their QoS restored. Non PCN-traffic is treated transparently, ie the
      PCN-domain is a normal DiffServ domain.
</p>
<p>An operator may choose to deploy either admission control or flow
      termination or both. Although designed to work together, they are
      independent mechanisms, and the use of one does not require or prevent
      the use of the other.
</p>
<p>A PCN-domain may have three encoding states (or pedantically, an
      operator may choose to use up three encoding states for PCN): not
      PCN-marked, threshold-marked, excess-traffic-marked. Then both PCN
      admission control and flow termination can be supported. As illustrated
      in Figure 1, admission control accepts new flows until the PCN-traffic
      rate on the bottleneck link rises above the PCN-threshold-rate, whilst
      if necessary the flow termination mechanism terminates flows down to the
      PCN-excess-rate on the bottleneck link.

<p>Figure 1: Schematic of how the PCN admission control and
          flow termination mechanisms operate as the rate of PCN-traffic
          increases, for a PCN-domain with three encoding states.
</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>On the other hand, a PCN-domain may have two encoding states (as in
      <a class='info' href='#PCN08-1'>[PCN08&#8209;1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Baseline Encoding and Transport of Pre-Congestion           Information,&rdquo; Oct&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>) (or pedantically, an operator may choose
      to use up two encoding states for PCN): not PCN-marked, PCN-marked. Then
      there are three possibilities, as discussed in the following paragraphs
      (see also Section 6.3).
</p>
<p>First, an operator could just use PCN's admission control, solving
      heavy congestion (caused by re-routing) by 'just waiting' - as sessions
      end, PCN-traffic naturally reduces, and meanwhile the admission control
      mechanism will prevent admission of new flows that use the affected
      links. So the PCN-domain will naturally return to normal operation, but
      with reduced capacity. The drawback of this approach would be that,
      until sufficient sessions have ended to relieve the congestion, all
      PCN-flows as well as lower priority services will be adversely
      affected.
</p>
<p>Second, an operator could just rely for admission control on
      statically provisioned capacity per PCN-ingress-node (regardless of the
      PCN-egress-node of a flow), as is typical in the hose model of the
      DiffServ architecture <a class='info' href='#RFC2475'>[RFC2475]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Blake, S., Black, D., Carlson, M., Davies, E., Wang, Z., and W. Weiss, &ldquo;An Architecture for Differentiated Services,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>. Such traffic
      conditioning agreements can lead to focused overload: many flows happen
      to focus on a particular link and then all flows through the congested
      link fail catastrophically. PCN's flow termination mechanism could then
      be used to counteract such a problem.
</p>
<p>Third, both admission control and flow termination can be triggered
      from the single type of PCN-marking; the main downside is that admission
      control is less accurate <a class='info' href='#Charny07-2'>[Charny07&#8209;2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Pre-Congestion Notification Using Single Marking for           Admission and Termination (work in progress),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Within the PCN-domain there is some flexibility about how the
      decision making functionality is distributed. These possibilities are
      outlined in Section 7.4 and also discussed elsewhere, such as in <a class='info' href='#Menth08-3'>[Menth08&#8209;3]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;PCN-Based Admission Control and Flow Termination,&rdquo; 2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The flow admission and termination decisions need to be enforced
      through per flow policing by the PCN-ingress-nodes. If there are several
      PCN-domains on the end-to-end path, then each needs to police at its
      PCN-ingress-nodes. One exception is if the operator runs both the access
      network (not a PCN-domain) and the core network (a PCN-domain); per flow
      policing could be devolved to the access network and not done at the
      PCN-ingress-node. Note: to aid readability, the rest of this draft
      assumes that policing is done by the PCN-ingress-nodes.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>PCN admission control has to fit with the overall approach to
      admission control. For instance <a class='info' href='#Briscoe06'>[Briscoe06]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;An edge-to-edge Deployment Model for Pre-Congestion           Notification: Admission Control over a DiffServ Region (work in           progress),&rdquo; October&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>
      describes the case where RSVP signalling runs end-to-end. The PCN-domain
      is a single RSVP hop, ie only the PCN-boundary-nodes process RSVP
      messages, with RSVP messages processed on each hop outside the
      PCN-domain, as in IntServ over DiffServ <a class='info' href='#RFC2998'>[RFC2998]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bernet, Y., Ford, P., Yavatkar, R., Baker, F., Zhang, L., Speer, M., Braden, R., Davie, B., Wroclawski, J., and E. Felstaine, &ldquo;A Framework for Integrated Services Operation over Diffserv Networks,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>.
      It would also be possible for the RSVP signalling to be originated
      and/or terminated by proxies, with application-layer signalling between
      the end user and the proxy (eg SIP signalling with a home hub). A
      similar example would use NSIS signalling instead of RSVP.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It is possible that a user wants its inelastic traffic to use the PCN
      mechanisms but also react to ECN marking outside the PCN-domain <a class='info' href='#Sarker08'>[Sarker08]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Usecases and Benefits of end to end ECN support in PCN           Domains (work in progress),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. Two possible ways to do this are to tunnel
      all PCN-packets across the PCN-domain, so that the ECN marks are carried
      transparently across the PCN-domain, or to use an encoding like <a class='info' href='#Moncaster08'>[Moncaster08]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;A three state extended PCN encoding scheme (work in           progress),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. Tunnelling is discussed further in Section
      7.7.
</p>

<p>Some further possible deployment models are outlined in the
      Appendix.

Assumptions and constraints on scope</h3>

<p>The scope is restricted by the following assumptions:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>these components are deployed in a single DiffServ domain, within
          which all PCN-nodes are PCN-enabled and are trusted for truthful
          PCN-marking and transport
</li>
<li>all flows handled by these mechanisms are inelastic and
          constrained to a known peak rate through policing or shaping
</li>
<li>the number of PCN-flows across any potential bottleneck link is
          sufficiently large that stateless, statistical mechanisms can be
          effective. To put it another way, the aggregate bit rate of
          PCN-traffic across any potential bottleneck link needs to be
          sufficiently large relative to the maximum additional bit rate added
          by one flow. This is the basic assumption of measurement-based
          admission control.
</li>
<li>PCN-flows may have different precedence, but the applicability of
          the PCN mechanisms for emergency use (911, GETS, WPS, MLPP, etc.) is
          out of scope.

Assumption 1: Trust and support of PCN - controlled environment</h3>

<p>We assume that the PCN-domain is a controlled environment, ie all
        the nodes in a PCN-domain run PCN and are trusted. There are several
        reasons this assumption: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The PCN-domain has to be encircled by a ring of
            PCN-boundary-nodes, otherwise traffic could enter a PCN-BA without
            being subject to admission control, which would potentially
            degrade the QoS of existing PCN-flows.
</li>
<li>Similarly, a PCN-boundary-node has to trust that all the
            PCN-nodes mark PCN-traffic consistently. A node not performing
            PCN-marking wouldn't be able to alert when it suffered
            pre-congestion, which potentially would lead to too many PCN-flows
            being admitted (or too few being terminated). Worse, a rogue node
            could perform various attacks, as discussed in the Security
            Considerations section.
</li>
</ul>

<p>One way of assuring the above two points is that the entire
        PCN-domain is run by a single operator. Another possibility is that
        there are several operators that trust each other in their handling of
        PCN-traffic.
</p>
<p>Note: All PCN-nodes need to be trustworthy. However if it is known
        that an interface cannot become pre-congested then it is not strictly
        necessary for it to be capable of PCN-marking. But this must be known
        even in unusual circumstances, eg after the failure of some links.

Assumption 2: Real-time applications</h3>

<p>We assume that any variation of source bit rate is independent of
        the level of pre-congestion. We assume that PCN-packets come from real
        time applications generating inelastic traffic, ie sending packets at
        the rate the codec produces them, regardless of the availability of
        capacity <a class='info' href='#RFC4594'>[RFC4594]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Babiarz, J., Chan, K., and F. Baker, &ldquo;Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service Classes,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. For example, voice and video
        requiring low delay, jitter and packet loss, the Controlled Load
        Service, <a class='info' href='#RFC2211'>[RFC2211]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wroclawski, J., &ldquo;Specification of the Controlled-Load Network Element Service,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a>, and the Telephony service

        focus the effort where it looks like PCN would be most useful, ie the
        sorts of applications where per flow QoS is a known requirement. In
        other words we focus on PCN providing a benefit to inelastic traffic
        (PCN may or may not provide a benefit to other types of traffic).
</p>
<p>As a consequence, it is assumed that PCN-marking is being applied
        to traffic scheduled with the expedited forwarding per-hop behaviour,

Assumption 3: Many flows and additional load</h3>

<p>We assume that there are many PCN-flows on any bottleneck link in
        the PCN-domain (or, to put it another way, the aggregate bit rate of
        PCN-traffic across any potential bottleneck link is sufficiently large
        relative to the maximum additional bit rate added by one PCN-flow).
        Measurement-based admission control assumes that the present is a
        reasonable prediction of the future: the network conditions are
        measured at the time of a new flow request, however the actual network
        performance must be acceptable during the call some time later. One
        issue is that if there are only a few variable rate flows, then the
        aggregate traffic level may vary a lot, perhaps enough to cause some
        packets to get dropped. If there are many flows then the aggregate
        traffic level should be statistically smoothed. How many flows is
        enough depends on a number of factors such as the variation in each
        flow's rate, the total rate of PCN-traffic, and the size of the
        "safety margin" between the traffic level at which we start
        admission-marking and at which packets are dropped or significantly
        delayed.
</p>
<p>We do not make explicit assumptions on how many PCN-flows are in
        each ingress-egress-aggregate. Performance evaluation work may clarify
        whether it is necessary to make any additional assumption on
        aggregation at the ingress-egress-aggregate level.

High-level functional architecture</h3>

<p>The high-level approach is to split
      functionality between:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>PCN-interior-nodes 'inside' the PCN-domain, which monitor their
          own state of pre-congestion and mark PCN-packets as appropriate.
          They are not flow-aware, nor aware of ingress-egress-aggregates. The
          functionality is also done by PCN-ingress-nodes for their outgoing
          interfaces (ie those 'inside' the PCN-domain).
</li>
<li>PCN-boundary-nodes at the edge of the PCN-domain, which control
          admission of new PCN-flows and termination of existing PCN-flows,
          based on information from PCN-interior-nodes. This information is in
          the form of the PCN-marked data packets (which are intercepted by
          the PCN-egress-nodes) and not signalling messages. Generally
          PCN-ingress-nodes are flow-aware.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The aim of this split is to keep the bulk of the network simple,
      scalable and robust, whilst confining policy, application-level and
      security interactions to the edge of the PCN-domain. For example the
      lack of flow awareness means that the PCN-interior-nodes don't care
      about the flow information associated with PCN-packets, nor do the
      PCN-boundary-nodes care about which PCN-interior-nodes its
      ingress-egress-aggregates traverse.
</p>
<p>In order to generate information about the current state of the
      PCN-domain, each PCN-node PCN-marks packets if it is "pre-congested".
      Exactly when a PCN-node decides if it is "pre-congested" (the algorithm)
      and exactly how packets are "PCN-marked" (the encoding) will be defined
      in separate standards-track documents, but at a high level it is as
      follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>the algorithms: a PCN-node meters the amount of PCN-traffic on
          each one of its outgoing (or incoming) links. The measurement is
          made as an aggregate of all PCN-packets, and not per flow. There are
          two algorithms, one for threshold-marking and one for
          excess-traffic-marking.
</li>
<li>the encoding(s): a PCN-node PCN-marks a PCN-packet by modifying a
          combination of the DSCP and ECN fields. In the "baseline" encoding
          <a class='info' href='#PCN08-1'>[PCN08&#8209;1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Baseline Encoding and Transport of Pre-Congestion           Information,&rdquo; Oct&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, the ECN field is set to 11 and the
          DSCP is not altered. Extension encodings may be defined that, at
          most, use a second DSCP (eg as in <a class='info' href='#Moncaster08'>[Moncaster08]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;A three state extended PCN encoding scheme (work in           progress),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>) and/or set the ECN field to values
          other than 11 (eg as in <a class='info' href='#Menth08-2'>[Menth08&#8209;2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;PCN Encoding for Packet-Specific Dual Marking (PSDM) (work in           progress),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>).
</li>
</ul>

<p>In a PCN-domain the operator may have two or three encoding states
      available. The baseline encoding provides two encoding states (not
      PCN-marked, PCN-marked), whilst extended encodings can provide three
      encoding states (not PCN-marked, threshold-marked,
      excess-traffic-marked).
</p>
<p>The PCN-boundary-nodes monitor the PCN-marked packets in order to
      extract information about the current state of the PCN-domain. Based on
      this monitoring, a distributed decision is made about whether to admit a
      prospective new flow or whether to terminate existing flow(s). Sections
      7.4 and 7.5 mention various possibilities for how the functionality
      could be distributed.
</p>
<p>PCN-marking needs to be configured on all (potentially pre-congested)
      links in the PCN-domain to ensure that the PCN mechanisms protect all
      links. The actual functionality can be configured on the outgoing or
      incoming interfaces of PCN-nodes - or one algorithm could be configured
      on the outgoing interface and the other on the incoming interface. The
      important point is that a consistent choice is made across the
      PCN-domain to ensure that the PCN mechanisms protect all links. See
      <a class='info' href='#PCN08-2'>[PCN08&#8209;2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Marking behaviour of PCN-nodes (work in progress),&rdquo; Oct&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> for further discussion.
</p>
<p>The objective of the threshold-marking algorithm is to threshold-mark
      all PCN-packets whenever the rate of PCN-packets is greater than some
      configured rate, the PCN-threshold-rate. The objective of the
      excess-traffic-marking algorithm is to excess-traffic-mark PCN-packets
      at a rate equal to the difference between the bit rate of PCN-packets
      and some configured rate, the PCN-excess-rate. Note that this
      description reflects the overall intent of the algorithm rather than its
      instantaneous behaviour, since the rate measured at a particular moment
      depends on the detailed algorithm, its implementation, and the traffic's
      variance as well as its rate (eg marking may well continue after a
      recent overload even after the instantaneous rate has dropped). The
      algorithms are specified in <a class='info' href='#PCN08-2'>[PCN08&#8209;2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Marking behaviour of PCN-nodes (work in progress),&rdquo; Oct&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Admission and termination approaches are detailed and compared in
      <a class='info' href='#Charny07-1'>[Charny07&#8209;1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Comparison of Proposed PCN Approaches (work in           progress),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#Menth08-3'>[Menth08&#8209;3]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;PCN-Based Admission Control and Flow Termination,&rdquo; 2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.6.1"></a><h3>6.1.&nbsp;
Flow admission</h3>

<p>The objective of PCN's flow admission control mechanism is to limit
        the PCN-traffic on each link in the PCN-domain to *roughly* its
        PCN-admissible-rate, by admitting or blocking prospective new flows,
        in order to protect the QoS of existing PCN-flows. With three encoding
        states available, the PCN-threshold-rate is configured by the operator
        as equal to the PCN-admissible-rate on each link. It is set lower than
        the traffic rate at which the link becomes congested and the node
        drops packets.
</p>
<p>Exactly how the admission control decision is made will be defined
        separately in informational documents. This document describes two
        approaches (others might be possible):
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>the PCN-egress-node measures (possibly as a moving average) the
            fraction of the PCN-traffic that is threshold-marked. The fraction
            is measured for a specific ingress-egress-aggregate. If the
            fraction is below a threshold value then the new flow is admitted,
            and if the fraction is above the threshold value then it is
            blocked. The fraction could be measured as an EWMA (exponentially
            weighted moving average), which has sometimes been called the
            "congestion level estimate".
</li>
<li>the PCN-egress-node monitors PCN-traffic and if it receives one
            (or several) threshold-marked packets, then the new flow is
            blocked, otherwise it is admitted. One possibility may be to react
            to the marking state of an initial flow set-up packet (eg RSVP
            PATH). Another is that after one (or several) threshold-marks then
            all flows are blocked until after a specific period of no
            congestion.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the admission control decision is made for a particular
        pair of PCN-boundary-nodes. So it is quite possible for a new flow to
        be admitted between one pair of PCN-boundary-nodes, whilst at the same
        time another admission request is blocked between a different pair of
        PCN-boundary-nodes.

<a name="rfc.section.6.2"></a><h3>6.2.&nbsp;
Flow termination</h3>

<p>The objective of PCN's flow termination mechanism is to limit the
        PCN-traffic on each link to *roughly* its PCN-supportable-rate, by
        terminating some existing PCN-flows, in order to protect the QoS of
        the remaining PCN-flows. With three encoding states available, the
        PCN-excess-rate is configured by the operator as equal to the
        PCN-supportable-rate on each link. It may be set lower than the
        traffic rate at which the link becomes congested and the node drops
        packets.
</p>
<p>Exactly how the flow termination decision is made will be defined
        separately in informational documents. This document describes several
        approaches (others might be possible):</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>In one approach the PCN-egress-node measures the rate of
            PCN-traffic that is not excess-traffic-marked, which is the amount
            of PCN-traffic that can actually be supported, and communicates
            this to the PCN-ingress-node. Also the PCN-ingress-node measures
            the rate of PCN-traffic that is destined for this specific
            PCN-egress-node, and hence it can calculate the excess amount that
            should be terminated.
</li>
<li>Another approach instead measures the rate of
            excess-traffic-marked traffic and terminates this amount of
            traffic. This terminates less traffic than the previous bullet if
            some nodes are dropping PCN-traffic.
</li>
<li>Another approach monitors PCN-packets and terminates some of
            the PCN-flows that have an excess-traffic-marked packet. (If all
            such flows were terminated, far too much traffic would be
            terminated, so a random selection needs to be made from those with
            an excess-traffic-marked packet, <a class='info' href='#Menth08-1'>[Menth08&#8209;1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Edge-Assisted Marked Flow Termination (work in           progress),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.)
</li>
</ul><p>Since flow termination is designed for "abnormal"
        circumstances, it is quite likely that some PCN-nodes are congested
        and hence packets are being dropped and/or significantly queued. The
        flow termination mechanism must accommodate this.
</p>
<p>Note also that the termination control decision is made for a
        particular pair of PCN-boundary-nodes. So it is quite possible for
        PCN-flows to be terminated between one pair of PCN-boundary-nodes,
        whilst at the same time none are terminated between a different pair
        of PCN-boundary-nodes.

<p></p>
<ul class="text">

Information transport</h3>

<p>The transport of pre-congestion information from a PCN-node to a
        PCN-egress-node is through PCN-markings in data packet headers, ie
        "in-band": no signalling protocol messaging is needed. Signalling is

        PCN-boundary-nodes, for example to convey the fraction of PCN-marked
        traffic from a PCN-egress-node to the relevant PCN-ingress-node.
        Exactly what information needs to be transported will be described in

PCN-traffic</h3>

<p>The following are some high-level points about how PCN works:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>There needs to be a way for a PCN-node to distinguish
            PCN-traffic from other traffic. This is through a combination of
            the DSCP field and/or ECN field.
</li>
<li>It is not advised to have non PCN-traffic that competes for the
            same capacity as PCN-traffic but, if there is such traffic, there
            needs to be a mechanism to limit it. &ldquo;Capacity&rdquo; means
            the forwarding bandwidth on a link; &ldquo;competes&rdquo; means
            that non PCN-packets will delay PCN-packets in the queue for the
            link. Hence more non PCN-traffic results in poorer QoS for PCN.
            Further, the unpredictable amount of non PCN-traffic makes the PCN
            mechanisms less accurate and so reduces PCN&rsquo;s ability to
            protect the QoS of admitted PCN-flows
</li>
<li>Two examples of such non PCN-traffic (ie that competes for the
            same capacity as PCN-traffic) are:
</li>
</ul>
<ol class="text">
<li><p>traffic that is priority scheduled over PCN (perhaps a
            particular application or an operator's control messages).
</li>
<li>traffic that is scheduled at the same priority as PCN (for
            example if the Voice-Admit codepoint is used for PCN-traffic <a class='info' href='#PCN08-1'>[PCN08&#8209;1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Baseline Encoding and Transport of Pre-Congestion           Information,&rdquo; Oct&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> and there is non-PCN voice-admit traffic
            in the PCN-domain).
</li>
</ol></p>
<ul class="text">
<li><p>If there is such non PCN-traffic (ie that competes for the same
            capacity as PCN-traffic), then PCN&rsquo;s mechanisms should take
            account of it, in order to improve the accuracy of the decision
            about whether to admit (or terminate) a PCN-flow. For example, one
            mechanism is that such non PCN-traffic contributes to the PCN
            meters (ie is metered by the threshold-marking and
            excess-traffic-marking algorithms).
</li>
<li>There will be non PCN-traffic that doesn&rsquo;t compete for
            the same capacity as PCN-traffic, because it is forwarded at lower
            priority. Hence it shouldn&rsquo;t contribute to the PCN meters.
            Examples are best effort and assured forwarding traffic. However,
            a PCN-node should dedicate some capacity to lower priority traffic
            so that it isn't starved.
</li>
<li>The document assumes that the PCN mechanisms are applied to a
            single behaviour aggregate in the PCN-domain. However, it would
            also be possible to apply them independently to more than one
            behaviour aggregate, which are distinguished by DSCP.
</li>
</ul>

Backwards compatibility</h3>

<p>PCN specifies semantics for the ECN field that differ from the
        default semantics of <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>. A particular PCN
        encoding scheme needs to describe how it meets the guidelines of BCP
        124 <a class='info' href='#RFC4774'>[RFC4774]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Floyd, S., &ldquo;Specifying Alternate Semantics for the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Field,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> for specifying alternative
        semantics for the ECN field. In summary the approach is to:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>use a DSCP to allow PCN-nodes to distinguish PCN-traffic that
            uses the alternative ECN semantics;
</li>
<li>define these semantics for use within a controlled region, the
            PCN-domain;
</li>
<li>take appropriate action if ECN capable, non-PCN traffic arrives
            at a PCN-ingress-node with the DSCP used by PCN.
</li>
</ul><p>For the baseline encoding <a class='info' href='#PCN08-1'>[PCN08&#8209;1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Baseline Encoding and Transport of Pre-Congestion           Information,&rdquo; Oct&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, the
        'appropriate action' is to block ECN-capable traffic that uses the
        same DSCP as PCN from entering the PCN-domain directly. Blocking means
        it is dropped or downgraded to a lower priority behaviour aggregate,
        or alternatively such traffic may be tunnelled through the PCN-domain.
        The reason that 'appropriate action' is needed is that the
        PCN-egress-node clears the ECN field to 00.
</p>
<p>Extended encoding schemes may take different 'appropriate
        action'.

Detailed Functional architecture</h3>

<p>This section is intended to provide a systematic summary of the new
      functional architecture in the PCN-domain. First it describes functions
      needed at the three specific types of PCN-node; these are data plane
      functions and are in addition to their normal router functions. Then it
      describes further functionality needed for both flow admission control
      and flow termination; these are signalling and decision-making
      functions, and there are various possibilities for where the functions
      are physically located. The section is split into:

PCN-interior-node functions</h3>

<p>Each link of the PCN-domain is configured with the following

PCN-ingress-node functions</h3>

<p>Each ingress link of the PCN-domain is configured with the
        following functionality:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Packet classification &ndash; determine whether an incoming
            packet is part of a previously admitted flow, by using a filter
            spec (eg DSCP, source and destination addresses and port
            numbers).
</li>
<li>Traffic conditioning - police, by dropping or downgrading, any
            packets received with a DSCP indicating PCN transport that do not
            belong to an admitted flow. (A prospective PCN-flow that is
            rejected could be blocked or admitted into a lower priority
            behaviour aggregate.) Similarly, police packets that are part of a
            previously admitted flow, to check that the flow keeps to the
            agreed rate or flowspec (eg <a class='info' href='#RFC1633'>[RFC1633]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, B., Clark, D., and S. Shenker, &ldquo;Integrated Services in the Internet Architecture: an Overview,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1994.</span><span>)</span></a> for a
            microflow and its NSIS equivalent).
</li>
<li>PCN-colour &ndash; set the DSCP and ECN fields appropriately
            for the PCN-domain, for example as in <a class='info' href='#PCN08-1'>[PCN08&#8209;1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Baseline Encoding and Transport of Pre-Congestion           Information,&rdquo; Oct&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>Meter - some approaches to flow termination require the
            PCN-ingress-node to measure the (aggregate) rate of PCN-traffic
            towards a particular PCN-egress-node.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two are policing functions, needed to make sure that
        PCN-packets admitted into the PCN-domain belong to a flow that has
        been admitted and to ensure that the flow keeps to the flowspec agreed
        (eg doesn't exceed an agreed maximum rate and is inelastic traffic).
        Installing the filter spec will typically be done by the signalling
        protocol, as will re-installing the filter, for example after a
        re-route that changes the PCN-ingress-node (see <a class='info' href='#Briscoe06'>[Briscoe06]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;An edge-to-edge Deployment Model for Pre-Congestion           Notification: Admission Control over a DiffServ Region (work in           progress),&rdquo; October&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> for an example using RSVP). PCN-colouring
        allows the rest of the PCN-domain to recognise PCN-packets.

PCN-egress-node functions</h3>

<p>Each egress link of the PCN-domain is configured with the following
        functionality:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Packet classify &ndash; determine which PCN-ingress-node a

<li>PCN-colour &ndash; for PCN-packets, set the DSCP and ECN fields

</li>
</ul>

<p>The metering functionality of course depends on whether it is
        targeted at admission control or flow termination. Alternatives
        involve the PCN-egress-node "measuring" as an aggregate (ie not per
        flow) all PCN-packets from a particular PCN-ingress-node, or
        "monitoring" the PCN-traffic and reacting to one (or several)
        PCN-marked packets. For PCN-colouring, <a class='info' href='#PCN08-1'>[PCN08&#8209;1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Baseline Encoding and Transport of Pre-Congestion           Information,&rdquo; Oct&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>

Admission control functions</h3>

<ul class="text">
<li>Make decision about admission &ndash; based on the output of

            "measures PCN-traffic", the measured traffic on the
            ingress-egress-aggregate is compared with some reference level. In
            the case where it "monitors PCN-marks", then the decision is based
            on whether one (or several) packets is (are) PCN-marked or not (eg
            the RSVP PATH message). In either case, the admission decision
            also takes account of policy and application layer requirements

</li>
<li>Communicate decision about admission - signal the decision to
            the node making the admission control request (which may be
            outside the PCN-domain), and to the policer (PCN-ingress-node
            function) for enforcement of the decision.
</li>
</ul><p>There are various possibilities for how the functionality

        used):
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The decision is made at the PCN-egress-node and the decision
            (admit or block) is signalled to the PCN-ingress-node.

<li>The decision is recommended by the PCN-egress-node (admit or
            block) but the decision is definitively made by the
            PCN-ingress-node. The rationale is that the PCN-egress-node
            naturally has the necessary information about PCN-marking on the
            ingress-egress-aggregate, but the PCN-ingress-node is the policy

            incoming traffic to ensure it is part of an admitted PCN-flow.
</li>
<li>The decision is made at the PCN-ingress-node, which requires
            that the PCN-egress-node signals PCN-feedback-information to the
            PCN-ingress-node. For example, it could signal the current
            fraction of PCN-traffic that is PCN-marked.
</li>

Flow termination functions</h3>

<p>As well as the functions covered above, other specific termination
        control functions need to be performed (others might be possible):
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>PCN-meter at PCN-egress-node - similarly to flow admission,
            there are two types of possibilities: to "measure

</li>
<li>Make decision about flow termination &ndash; use the

Addressing</h3>

<p>PCN-nodes may need to know the address of other PCN-nodes. Note: in
        all cases PCN-interior-nodes don't need to know the address of any
        other PCN-nodes (except as normal their next hop neighbours, for
        routing purposes).
</p>
<p>The PCN-egress-node needs to know the address of the
        PCN-ingress-node associated with a flow, at a minimum so that the
        PCN-ingress-node can be informed to enforce the admission decision
        (and any flow termination decision) through policing. There are
        various possibilities for how the PCN-egress-node can do this, ie
        associate the received packet to the correct ingress-egress-aggregate.
        It is not the intention of this document to mandate a particular
        mechanism.</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The addressing information can be gathered from signalling. For
            example, regular processing of an RSVP Path message, as the
            PCN-ingress-node is the previous RSVP hop (PHOP) (<a class='info' href='#Lefaucheur06'>[Lefaucheur06]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;RSVP Extensions for Admission Control over Diffserv using           Pre-congestion Notification (PCN) (work in progress),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>).

            signal its address to the PCN-egress-node.
</li>
<li>Always tunnel PCN-traffic across the PCN-domain. Then the
            PCN-ingress-node's address is simply the source address of the
            outer packet header. The PCN-ingress-node needs to learn the
            address of the PCN-egress-node, either by manual configuration or
            by one of the automated tunnel endpoint discovery mechanisms (such
            as signalling or probing over the data route, interrogating
            routing or using a centralised broker).

Tunnelling</h3>

<p>Tunnels may originate and/or terminate within a PCN-domain (eg IP
        over IP, IP over MPLS). It is important that the PCN-marking of any
        packet can potentially influence PCN&rsquo;s flow admission control
        and termination &ndash; it shouldn&rsquo;t matter whether the packet
        happens to be tunnelled at the PCN-node that PCN-marks the packet, or
        indeed whether it&rsquo;s decapsulated or encapsulated by a subsequent
        PCN-node. This suggests that the &ldquo;uniform conceptual
        model&rdquo; described in <a class='info' href='#RFC2983'>[RFC2983]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Black, D., &ldquo;Differentiated Services and Tunnels,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> should be
        re-applied in the PCN context. In line with this and the approach of
        <a class='info' href='#RFC4303'>[RFC4303]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S., &ldquo;IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP),&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#Briscoe08-2'>[Briscoe08&#8209;2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Layered Encapsulation of Congestion Notification (work in           progress),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>,
        the following rule is applied if encapsulation is done within the
        PCN-domain:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>any PCN-marking is copied into the outer header
</li>
</ul><p>Note: A tunnel will not provide this behaviour if it complies
        with <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> tunnelling in either mode, but it
        will if it complies with <a class='info' href='#RFC4301'>[RFC4301]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and K. Seo, &ldquo;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> IPSec

<p>Similarly, in line with the &ldquo;uniform conceptual model&rdquo;
        of <a class='info' href='#RFC2983'>[RFC2983]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Black, D., &ldquo;Differentiated Services and Tunnels,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>, the &ldquo;full-functionality

Seo, &ldquo;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>, the following rule is applied if
        decapsulation is done within the PCN-domain:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>if the outer header's marking state is more severe then it is
            copied onto the inner header.
</li>
</ul><p>Note: the order of increasing severity is: not PCN-marked;
        threshold-marking; excess-traffic-marking.
</p>
<p>An operator may wish to tunnel PCN-traffic from PCN-ingress-nodes
        to PCN-egress-nodes. The PCN-marks shouldn&rsquo;t be visible outside
        the PCN-domain, which can be achieved by the PCN-egress-node doing the
        PCN-colouring function (Section 7.3) after all the other (PCN and
        tunnelling) functions. The potential reasons for doing such tunnelling
        are: the PCN-egress-node then automatically knows the address of the
        relevant PCN-ingress-node for a flow; even if ECMP is running, all
        PCN-packets on a particular ingress-egress-aggregate follow the same
        path. But it also has drawbacks, for example the additional overhead
        in terms of bandwidth and processing, and the cost of setting up a
        mesh of tunnels between PCN-boundary-nodes (there is an N^2 scaling
        issue).
</p>
<p>Potential issues arise for a &ldquo;partially PCN-capable
        tunnel&rdquo;, ie where only one tunnel endpoint is in the PCN
        domain:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The tunnel originates outside a PCN-domain and ends inside it.
            If the packet arrives at the tunnel ingress with the same encoding
            as used within the PCN-domain to indicate PCN-marking, then this
            could lead the PCN-egress-node to falsely measure
            pre-congestion.
</li>
<li>The tunnel originates inside a PCN-domain and ends outside it.
            If the packet arrives at the tunnel ingress already PCN-marked,
            then it will still have the same encoding when it&rsquo;s
            decapsulated which could potentially confuse nodes beyond the
            tunnel egress.
</li>
</ol><p>In line with the solution for partially capable DiffServ
        tunnels in <a class='info' href='#RFC2983'>[RFC2983]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Black, D., &ldquo;Differentiated Services and Tunnels,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>, the following rules are

</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>For case (1), the tunnel egress node clears any PCN-marking on
            the inner header. This rule is applied before the &lsquo;copy on
            decapsulation&rsquo; rule above.
</li>
<li>For case (2), the tunnel ingress node clears any PCN-marking on
            the inner header. This rule is applied after the &lsquo;copy on
            encapsulation&rsquo; rule above.
</li>
</ul><p> Note that the above implies that one has to know, or
        determine, the characteristics of the other end of the tunnel as part
        of establishing it.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Tunnelling constraints were a major factor in the choice of the
        baseline encoding. As explained in <a class='info' href='#PCN08-1'>[PCN08&#8209;1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Baseline Encoding and Transport of Pre-Congestion           Information,&rdquo; Oct&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>,
        with current tunnelling endpoints only the 11 codepoint of the ECN
        field survives decapsulation, and hence the baseline encoding only
        uses the 11 codepoint to indicate PCN-marking. Extended encoding
        schemes need to explain their interactions with (or assumptions about)
        tunnelling. A lengthy discussion of all the issues associated with
        layered encapsulation of congestion notification (for ECN as well as
        PCN) is in <a class='info' href='#Briscoe08-2'>[Briscoe08&#8209;2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Layered Encapsulation of Congestion Notification (work in           progress),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Fault handling</h3>

<p>If a PCN-interior-node (or one of its links) fails, then lower
        layer protection mechanisms or the regular IP routing protocol will
        eventually re-route around it. If the new route can carry all the
        admitted traffic, flows will gracefully continue. If instead this
        causes early warning of pre-congestion on the new route, then
        admission control based on pre-congestion notification will ensure new
        flows will not be admitted until enough existing flows have departed.
        Re-routing may result in heavy (pre-)congestion, when the flow
        termination mechanism will kick in.
</p>
<p>If a PCN-boundary-node fails then we would like the regular QoS

Challenges</h3>

<p>Prior work on PCN and similar mechanisms has thrown up a number of
      considerations about PCN's design goals (things PCN should be good at)
      and some issues that have been hard to solve in a fully satisfactory
      manner. Taken as a whole it represents a list of trade-offs (it is
      unlikely that they can all be 100% achieved) and perhaps as evaluation
      criteria to help an operator (or the IETF) decide between options.
</p>
<p>The following are open issues. They are mainly taken from <a class='info' href='#Briscoe06'>[Briscoe06]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;An edge-to-edge Deployment Model for Pre-Congestion           Notification: Admission Control over a DiffServ Region (work in           progress),&rdquo; October&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, which also describes some possible
      solutions. Note that some may be considered unimportant in general or in
      specific deployment scenarios or by some operators.
</p>
<p>NOTE: Potential solutions are out of scope for this document.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>ECMP (Equal Cost Multi-Path) Routing: The level of pre-congestion
          is measured on a specific ingress-egress-aggregate. However, if the
          PCN-domain runs ECMP, then traffic on this ingress-egress-aggregate
          may follow several different paths - some of the paths could be
          pre-congested whilst others are not. There are three potential
          problems:
<ol class="text">
<li>over-admission: a new flow is admitted (because the
              pre-congestion level measured by the PCN-egress-node is
              sufficiently diluted by unmarked packets from non-congested
              paths that a new flow is admitted), but its packets travel
              through a pre-congested PCN-node.
</li>
<li>under-admission: a new flow is blocked (because the
              pre-congestion level measured by the PCN-egress-node is
              sufficiently increased by PCN-marked packets from pre-congested
              paths that a new flow is blocked), but its packets travel along
              an uncongested path.
</li>
<li>ineffective termination: a flow is terminated, but its path
              doesn't travel through the (pre-)congested router(s). Since flow
              termination is a 'last resort', which protects the network
              should over-admission occur, this problem is probably more
              important to solve than the other two.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>ECMP and signalling: It is possible that, in a PCN-domain running
          ECMP, the signalling packets (eg RSVP, NSIS) follow a different path
          than the data packets, which could matter if the signalling packets
          are used as probes. Whether this is an issue depends on which fields
          the ECMP algorithm uses; if the ECMP algorithm is restricted to the
          source and destination IP addresses, then it will not be an issue.
          ECMP and signalling interactions are a specific instance of a
          general issue for non-traditional routing combined with resource
          management along a path <a class='info' href='#Hancock02'>[Hancock02]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Slide 14 of 'NSIS: An Outline Framework for QoS           Signalling',&rdquo; May&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>Tunnelling: There are scenarios where tunnelling makes it
          difficult to determine the path in the PCN-domain. The problem, its
          impact, and the potential solutions are similar to those for
          ECMP.
</li>
<li>Scenarios with only one tunnel endpoint in the PCN domain may
          make it harder for the PCN-egress-node to gather from the signalling
          messages (eg RSVP, NSIS) the identity of the PCN-ingress-node.
</li>
<li>Bi-Directional Sessions: Many applications have bi-directional
          sessions - hence there are two microflows that should be admitted
          (or terminated) as a pair - for instance a bi-directional voice call
          only makes sense if microflows in both directions are admitted.
          However, the PCN mechanisms concern admission and termination of a
          single flow, and coordination of the decision for both flows is a
          matter for the signalling protocol and out of scope of PCN. One
          possible example would use SIP pre-conditions. However, there are
          others.
</li>
<li>Global Coordination: PCN makes its admission decision based on
          PCN-markings on a particular ingress-egress-aggregate. Decisions
          about flows through a different ingress-egress-aggregate are made
          independently. However, one can imagine network topologies and
          traffic matrices where, from a global perspective, it would be
          better to make a coordinated decision across all the
          ingress-egress-aggregates for the whole PCN-domain. For example, to
          block (or even terminate) flows on one ingress-egress-aggregate so
          that more important flows through a different
          ingress-egress-aggregate could be admitted. The problem may well be
          relatively insignificant.
</li>
<li>Aggregate Traffic Characteristics: Even when the number of flows
          is stable, the traffic level through the PCN-domain will vary
          because the sources vary their traffic rates. PCN works best when
          there is not too much variability in the total traffic level at a
          PCN-node's interface (ie in the aggregate traffic from all sources).
          Too much variation means that a node may (at one moment) not be
          doing any PCN-marking and then (at another moment) drop packets
          because it is overloaded. This makes it hard to tune the admission
          control scheme to stop admitting new flows at the right time.
          Therefore the problem is more likely with fewer, burstier flows.
</li>
<li>Flash crowds and Speed of Reaction: PCN is a measurement-based
          mechanism and so there is an inherent delay between packet marking
          by PCN-interior-nodes and any admission control reaction at
          PCN-boundary-nodes. For example, potentially if a big burst of
          admission requests occurs in a very short space of time (eg prompted
          by a televote), they could all get admitted before enough PCN-marks
          are seen to block new flows. In other words, any additional load
          offered within the reaction time of the mechanism must not move the
          PCN-domain directly from a no congestion state to overload. This
          'vulnerability period' may have an impact at the signalling level,
          for instance QoS requests should be rate limited to bound the number
          of requests able to arrive within the vulnerability period.
</li>
<li>Silent at start: after a successful admission request the source
          may wait some time before sending data (eg waiting for the called
          party to answer). Then the risk is that, in some circumstances,
          PCN's measurements underestimate what the pre-congestion level will
          be when the source does start sending data.
</li>

        diverse industry architectures. It may be possible to have different
        PCN-boundary-node behaviours for different ingress-egress-aggregates
        within the same PCN-domain.
</p>
<p>A PCN marking behaviour (threshold-marking, excess-traffic-marking)
        is enabled on either the egress or the ingress interfaces of
        PCN-nodes. A consistent choice must be made across the PCN-domain to
        ensure that the PCN mechanisms protect all links.

<p>PCN configuration control variables fall into the following

<p>It may be possible for an operator to configure some

System options</h3>

<p>On PCN-interior-nodes there will be very few system options:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Whether two PCN-markings (threshold-marked and
              excess-traffic-marked) are enabled or only one. Typically all
              nodes throughout a PCN-domain will be configured the same in
              this respect. However, exceptions could be made. For example, if
              most PCN-nodes used both markings, but some legacy hardware was
              incapable of running two algorithms, an operator might be
              willing to configure these legacy nodes solely for
              excess-traffic-marking to enable flow termination as a
              back-stop. It would be sensible to place such nodes where they
              could be provisioned with a greater leeway over expected traffic
              levels.
</li>
<li>In the case where only one PCN-marking is enabled, all nodes
              must be configured to generate PCN-marks from the same meter (ie
              either the threshold meter or the excess traffic meter).
</li>
</ul><p> PCN-boundary-nodes (ingress and egress) will have more
          system options:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Which of admission and flow termination are enabled. If any
              PCN-interior-node is configured to generate a marking, all
              PCN-boundary-nodes must be able to interpret that marking (which
              includes understanding, in a PCN-domain that uses only one type
              of PCN-marking, whether they are generated by
              PCN-interior-nodes' threshold meters or the excess traffic
              meters). Therefore all PCN-boundary-nodes must be configured the
              same in this respect.

<li>Where flow admission and termination decisions are made: at

Parameters</h3>

<p>Like any DiffServ domain, every node within a PCN-domain will
          need to be configured with the DSCP(s) used to identify PCN-packets.
          On each interior link the main configuration parameters are the
          PCN-threshold-rate and PCN-excess-rate. A larger PCN-threshold-rate
          enables more PCN-traffic to be admitted on a link, hence improving
          capacity utilisation. A PCN-excess-rate set further above the
          PCN-threshold-rate allows greater increases in traffic (whether due
          to natural fluctuations or some unexpected event) before any flows
          are terminated, ie minimises the chances of unnecessarily triggering
          the termination mechanism. For instance, an operator may want to
          design their network so that it can cope with a failure of any
          single PCN-node without terminating any flows.
</p>
<p>Setting these rates on first deployment of PCN will be very
          similar to the traditional process for sizing an admission
          controlled network, depending on: the operator's requirements for
          minimising flow blocking (grade of service), the expected PCN
          traffic load on each link and its statistical characteristics (the
          traffic matrix), contingency for re-routing the PCN traffic matrix
          in the event of single or multiple failures, and the expected load
          from other classes relative to link capacities <a class='info' href='#Menth07'>[Menth07]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;PCN-Based Resilient Network Admission Control: The Impact of           a Single Bit&quot;,&rdquo; 2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. But once a domain is in operation, a PCN
          design goal is to be able to determine growth in these configured
          rates much more simply, by monitoring PCN-marking rates from actual
          rather than expected traffic (see Section 9.2 on Performance &amp;
          Provisioning).
</p>
<p>Operators may also wish to configure a rate greater than the
          PCN-excess-rate that is the absolute maximum rate that a link allows
          for PCN-traffic. This may simply be the physical link rate, but some
          operators may wish to configure a logical limit to prevent
          starvation of other traffic classes during any brief period after
          PCN-traffic exceeds the PCN-excess-rate but before flow termination
          brings it back below this rate.
</p>
<p>Threshold-marking requires a threshold token bucket depth to be
          configured, excess-traffic-marking needs a value for the MTU
          (maximum size of a PCN-packet on the link) and both require setting
          a maximum size of their token buckets. It will be preferable for
          there to be rules to set defaults for these parameters, but then
          allow operators to change them, for instance if average traffic
          characteristics change over time.
</p>
<p>The PCN-egress-node may allow configuration of the following:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>how it smooths metering of PCN-markings (eg EWMA
              parameters)
</li>
</ul><p>Whichever node makes admission and flow termination
          decisions will contain algorithms for converting PCN-marking levels
          into admission or flow termination decisions. These will also
          require configurable parameters, for instance:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>an admission control algorithm that is based on the fraction
              of marked packets will at least require a marking threshold
              setting above which it denies admission to new flows;
</li>
<li>flow termination algorithms will probably require a parameter
              to delay termination of any flows until it is more certain that
              an anomalous event is not transient;
</li>
<li>a parameter to control the trade-off between how quickly
              excess flows are terminated, and over-termination.

          require a global parameter to be defined on all PCN-nodes, but only
          needs one PCN marking rate to be configured on each link. The global
          parameter is a scaling factor between admission and termination (the
          PCN-traffic rate on a link up to which flows are admitted vs the
          rate above which flows are terminated). <a class='info' href='#Charny07-2'>[Charny07&#8209;2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Pre-Congestion Notification Using Single Marking for           Admission and Termination (work in progress),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> discusses in full the impact of this

Performance &amp; Provisioning OAM</h3>

<p>Monitoring of performance factors measurable from *outside* the PCN
        domain will be no different with PCN than with any other packet-based
        flow admission control system, both at the flow level (blocking
        probability etc) and the packet level (jitter <a class='info' href='#RFC3393'>[RFC3393]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Demichelis, C. and P. Chimento, &ldquo;IP Packet Delay Variation Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#Y.1541'>[Y.1541]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Network Performance Objectives for IP-based Services,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, loss rate
        <a class='info' href='#RFC4656'>[RFC4656]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shalunov, S., Teitelbaum, B., Karp, A., Boote, J., and M. Zekauskas, &ldquo;A One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, mean opinion score <a class='info' href='#P.800'>[P.800]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Methods for subjective determination of transmission           quality,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a>, etc). The difference is that PCN is
        intentionally designed to indicate *internally* which exact
        resource(s) are the cause of performance problems and by how much.
</p>
<p>Even better, PCN indicates which resources will probably cause
        problems if they are not upgraded soon. This can be achieved by the
        management system monitoring the total amount (in bytes) of
        PCN-marking generated by each queue over a period. Given possible long
        provisioning lead times, pre-congestion volume is the best metric to
        reveal whether sufficient persistent demand has occurred to warrant an
        upgrade. Because, even before utilisation becomes problematic, the
        statistical variability of traffic will cause occasional bursts of
        pre-congestion. This 'early warning system' decouples the process of
        adding customers from the provisioning process. This should cut the
        time to add a customer when compared against admission control
        provided over native DiffServ <a class='info' href='#RFC2998'>[RFC2998]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bernet, Y., Ford, P., Yavatkar, R., Baker, F., Zhang, L., Speer, M., Braden, R., Davie, B., Wroclawski, J., and E. Felstaine, &ldquo;A Framework for Integrated Services Operation over Diffserv Networks,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>, because
        it saves having to verify the capacity planning process before adding
        each customer.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, before triggering an upgrade, the long term
        pre-congestion volume on each link can be used to balance traffic load
        across the PCN-domain by adjusting the link weights of the routing
        system. When an upgrade to a link&rsquo;s configured PCN-rates is
        required, it may also be necessary to upgrade the physical capacity
        available to other classes. But usually there will be sufficient
        physical capacity for the upgrade to go ahead as a simple
        configuration change. Alternatively, <a class='info' href='#Songhurst06'>[Songhurst06]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Guaranteed QoS Synthesis for Admission Control with Shared           Capacity,&rdquo; Feburary&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> describes an adaptive rather than
        preconfigured system, where the configured PCN-threshold-rate is
        replaced with a high and low water mark and the marking algorithm
        automatically optimises how physical capacity is shared using the
        relative loads from PCN and other traffic classes.
</p>
<p>All the above processes require just three extra counters
        associated with each PCN queue: threshold-markings,
        excess-traffic-markings and drop. Every time a PCN packet is marked or
        dropped its size in bytes should be added to the appropriate counter.
        Then the management system can read the counters at any time and
        subtract a previous reading to establish the incremental volume of
        each type of (pre-)congestion. Readings should be taken frequently, so
        that anomalous events (eg re-routes) can be distinguished from regular
        fluctuating demand if required.

Accounting OAM</h3>

<p>Accounting is only done at trust boundaries so it is out of scope
        of this document, which is confined to intra-domain issues. Use of PCN
        internal to a domain makes no difference to the flow signalling events
        crossing trust boundaries outside the PCN-domain, which are typically
        used for accounting.

Fault OAM</h3>

<p>Fault OAM is about preventing faults, telling the management system
        (or manual operator) that the system has recovered (or not) from a
        failure, and about maintaining information to aid fault diagnosis.
</p>
<p>Admission blocking and particularly flow termination mechanisms
        should rarely be needed in practice. It would be unfortunate if they
        didn't work after an option had been accidentally disabled. Therefore
        it will be necessary to regularly test that the live system works as
        intended (devising a meaningful test is left as an exercise for the
        operator).
</p>
<p><a class='info' href='#detailed-arch'>Section&nbsp;7<span> (</span><span class='info'>Detailed Functional architecture</span><span>)</span></a> describes how the PCN
        architecture has been designed to ensure admitted flows continue
        gracefully after recovering automatically from link or node failures.
        The need to record and monitor re-routing events affecting signalling
        is unchanged by the addition of PCN to a DiffServ domain. Similarly,
        re-routing events within the PCN-domain will be recorded and monitored
        just as they would be without PCN.
</p>
<p>PCN-marking does make it possible to record 'near-misses'. For
        instance, at the PCN-egress-node a 'reporting threshold' could be set
        to monitor how often - and for how long - the system comes close to
        triggering flow blocking without actually doing so. Similarly, bursts
        of flow termination marking could be recorded even if they are not
        sufficiently sustained to trigger flow termination. Such statistics
        could be correlated with per-queue counts of marking volume (Section
        9.2) to upgrade resources in danger of causing service degradation, or
        to trigger manual tracing of intermittent incipient errors that would
        otherwise have gone unnoticed.
</p>
<p>Finally, of course, many faults are caused by failings in the
        management process ('human error'): a wrongly configured address in a
        node, a wrong address given in a signalling protocol, a wrongly
        configured parameter in a queueing algorithm, a node set into a
        different mode from other nodes, and so on. Generally, a clean design
        with few configurable options ensures this class of faults can be
        traced more easily and prevented more often. Sound management practice
        at run-time also helps. For instance: a management system should be
        used that constrains configuration changes within system rules (eg
        preventing an option setting inconsistent with other nodes);
        configuration options should also be recorded in an offline database;
        and regular automatic consistency checks between live systems and the
        database should be performed. PCN adds nothing specific to this class
        of problems.

Security OAM</h3>

<p>Security OAM is about using secure operational practices as well as
        being able to track security breaches or near-misses at run-time. PCN
        adds few specifics to the general good practice required in this field
        <a class='info' href='#RFC4778'>[RFC4778]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kaeo, M., &ldquo;Operational Security Current Practices in Internet Service Provider Environments,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, other than those below. The correct
        functions of the system should be monitored (Section 9.2) in multiple
        independent ways and correlated to detect possible security breaches.
        Persistent (pre-)congestion marking should raise an alarm (both on the
        node doing the marking and on the PCN-egress-node metering it).
        Similarly, persistently poor external QoS metrics such as jitter or
        MOS should raise an alarm. The following are examples of symptoms that
        may be the result of innocent faults, rather than attacks, but until
        diagnosed they should be logged and trigger a security alarm:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Anomalous patterns of non-conforming incoming signals and
            packets rejected at the PCN-ingress-nodes (eg packets already
            marked PCN-capable, or traffic persistently starving token bucket
            policers).
</li>
<li>PCN-capable packets arriving at a PCN-egress-node with no
            associated state for mapping them to a valid
            ingress-egress-aggregate.
</li>
<li>A PCN-ingress-node receiving feedback signals about the
            pre-congestion level on a non-existent aggregate, or that are
            inconsistent with other signals (eg unexpected sequence numbers,
            inconsistent addressing, conflicting reports of the pre-congestion
            level, etc).
</li>
<li>Pre-congestion marking arriving at a PCN-egress-node with
            (pre-)congestion markings focused on particular flows, rather than
            randomly distributed throughout the aggregate.

Security considerations</h3>

<p>Security considerations essentially come from the Trust Assumption
      (Section 5.1), ie that all PCN-nodes are PCN-enabled and are trusted for
      truthful PCN-marking and transport. PCN splits functionality between
      PCN-interior-nodes and PCN-boundary-nodes, and the security
      considerations are somewhat different for each, mainly because
      PCN-boundary-nodes are flow-aware and PCN-interior-nodes are not.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Because the PCN-boundary-nodes are flow-aware, they are trusted
          to use that awareness correctly. The degree of trust required
          depends on the kinds of decisions they have to make and the kinds of
          information they need to make them. There is nothing specific to
          PCN.
</li>
<li>The PCN-ingress-nodes police packets to ensure a PCN-flow sticks
          within its agreed limit, and to ensure that only PCN-flows that have
          been admitted contribute PCN-traffic into the PCN-domain. The
          policer must drop (or perhaps downgrade to a different DSCP) any
          PCN-packets received that are outside this remit. This is similar to
          the existing IntServ behaviour. Between them the PCN-boundary-nodes
          must encircle the PCN-domain, otherwise PCN-packets could enter the
          PCN-domain without being subject to admission control, which would
          potentially destroy the QoS of existing flows.
</li>
<li>PCN-interior-nodes are not flow-aware. This prevents some
          security attacks where an attacker targets specific flows in the
          data plane - for instance for DoS or eavesdropping.
</li>
<li>The PCN-boundary-nodes rely on correct PCN-marking by the
          PCN-interior-nodes. For instance a rogue PCN-interior-node could
          PCN-mark all packets so that no flows were admitted. Another
          possibility is that it doesn't PCN-mark any packets, even when it is
          pre-congested. More subtly, the rogue PCN-interior-node could
          perform these attacks selectively on particular flows, or it could
          PCN-mark the correct fraction overall, but carefully choose which
          flows it marked.
</li>
<li>The PCN-boundary-nodes should be able to deal with DoS attacks
          and state exhaustion attacks based on fast changes in per flow
          signalling.
</li>
<li>The signalling between the PCN-boundary-nodes must be protected
          from attacks. For example the recipient needs to validate that the
          message is indeed from the node that claims to have sent it.
          Possible measures include digest authentication and protection
          against replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. For the specific
          protocol RSVP, hop-by-hop authentication is in <a class='info' href='#RFC2747'>[RFC2747]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baker, F., Lindell, B., and M. Talwar, &ldquo;RSVP Cryptographic Authentication,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>, and <a class='info' href='#Behringer07'>[Behringer07]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Applicability of Keying Methods for RSVP Security (work in           progress),&rdquo; Nov&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> may
          also be useful.

Changes from -04 to -05</h3>

<p>Minor nits removed as follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Further minor changes to reflect that baseline encoding is
            consensus, standards track document, whilst there can be
            (experimental track) encoding extensions
</li>
<li>Traffic conditioning updated to reflect discussions in Dublin,
            mainly that PCN-interior-nodes don't police PCN-traffic (so
            deleted bullet in S7.1) and that it is not advised to have non
            PCN-traffic that shares the same capacity (on a link) as
            PCN-traffic (so added bullet in S6.5)
</li>
<li>Probing moved into Appendix A and deleted the 'third viewpoint'
            (admission control based on the marking of a single packet like an
            RSVP PATH message) - since this isn't really probing, and in any
            case is already mentioned in S6.1.
</li>
<li>Minor changes to S9 Operations and management - mainly to
            reflect that consensus on marking behaviour has simplified things
            so eg there are fewer parameters to configure.
</li>
<li>A few terminology-related errors expunged, and two pictures
            added to help.
</li>
<li>Re-phrased the claim about the natural decision point in
            S7.4
</li>
<li>Clarified that extended encoding schemes need to explain their
            interactions with (or assumptions about) tunnelling (S7.7) and how
            they meet the guidelines of BCP124 (S6.6)
</li>
<li>Corrected the third bullet in S6.2 (to reflect consensus about
            PCN-marking)
</li>

Changes from -02 to -03</h3>

<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Abstract: Clarified by removing the term 'aggregated'.
            Follow-up clarifications later in draft: S1: expanded
            PCN-egress-nodes bullet to mention case where the
            PCN-feedback-information is about one (or a few) PCN-marks, rather
            than aggregated information; S3 clarified PCN-meter; S5 minor
            changes; conclusion.
</li>
<li>S1: added a paragraph about how the PCN-domain looks to the
            outside world (essentially it looks like a DiffServ domain).
</li>
<li>S2: tweaked the PCN-traffic terminology bullet: changed PCN
            traffic classes to PCN behaviour aggregates, to be more in line
            with traditional DiffServ jargon (-&gt; follow-up changes later in
            draft); included a definition of PCN-flows (and corrected a couple
            of 'PCN microflows' to 'PCN-flows' later in draft)
</li>
<li>S3.5: added possibility of downgrading to best effort, where
            PCN-packets arrive at PCN-ingress-node already ECN marked (CE or
            ECN nonce)
</li>
<li>S4: added note about whether talk about PCN operating on an
            interface or on a link. In S8.1 (OAM) mentioned that PCN
            functionality needs to be configured consistently on either the
            ingress or the egress interface of PCN-nodes in a PCN-domain.
</li>
<li>S5.2: clarified that signalling protocol installs flow filter
            spec at PCN-ingress-node (&amp; updates after possible
            re-route)
</li>
<li>S5.6: addressing: clarified
</li>
<li>S5.7: added tunnelling issue of N^2 scaling if you set up a
            mesh of tunnels between PCN-boundary-nodes
</li>
<li>S7.3: Clarified the "third viewpoint" of probing (always
            probe).
</li>
<li>S8.1: clarified that SNMP is only an example; added note that
            an operator may be able to not run PCN on some PCN-interior-nodes,
            if it knows that these links will never become (pre-)congested;
            added note that it may be possible to have different
            PCN-boundary-node behaviours for different
            ingress-egress-aggregates within the same PCN-domain.
</li>
<li>Appendix: Created an Appendix about "Possible work items beyond
            the scope of the current PCN WG Charter". Material moved from near
            start of S3 and elsewhere throughout draft. Moved text about
            centralised decision node to Appendix.

<ul class="text">
<li>S1: Benefits: provisioning bullet extended to stress that PCN
            does not use RFC2475-style traffic conditioning.
</li>
<li>S1: Deployment models: mentioned, as variant of PCN-domain
            extending to end nodes, that may extend to LAN edge switch.
</li>
<li>S3.1: Trust Assumption: added note about not needing
            PCN-marking capability if known that an interface cannot become
            pre-congested.
</li>
<li>S4: now divided into sub-sections

<li>S4.1: Admission control: added second proposed method for how

            several) PCN-marked packets).
</li>
<li>S5: Probing sub-section removed. Material now in new S7.

        are:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>S1: Benefits: added one about provisioning (and contrast with
            DiffServ SLAs)
</li>
<li>S1: Benefits: clarified that the objective is also to stop
            PCN-packets being significantly delayed (previously only mentioned
            not dropping packets)
</li>
<li>S1: Deployment models: added one where policing is done at
            ingress of access network and not at ingress of PCN-domain (assume
            trust between networks)
</li>
<li>S1: Deployment models: corrected MPLS-TE to MPLS
</li>
<li>S2: Terminology: adjusted definition of PCN-domain
</li>
<li>S3.5: Other assumptions: corrected, so that two assumptions
            (PCN-nodes not performing ECN and PCN-ingress-node discarding
            arriving CE packet) only apply if the PCN WG decides to encode
            PCN-marking in the ECN-field.
</li>
<li>S4 &amp; S5: changed PCN-marking algorithm to marking
            behaviour
</li>
<li>S4: clarified that PCN-interior-node functionality applies for
            each outgoing interface, and added clarification: "The
            functionality is also done by PCN-ingress-nodes for their outgoing
            interfaces (ie those 'inside' the PCN-domain)."
</li>
<li>S4 (near end): altered to say that a PCN-node "should" dedicate
            some capacity to lower priority traffic so that it isn't starved
            (was "may")
</li>
<li>S5: clarified to say that PCN functionality is done on an
            'interface' (rather than on a 'link')
</li>
<li>S5.2: deleted erroneous mention of service level agreement
</li>
<li>S5.5: Probing: re-written, especially to distinguish probing to
            test the ingress-egress-aggregate from probing to test a
            particular ECMP path.
</li>
<li>S5.7: Addressing: added mention of probing; added that in the
            case where traffic is always tunnelled across the PCN-domain, add
            a note that he PCN-ingress-node needs to know the address of the
            PCN-egress-node.
</li>
<li>S5.8: Tunnelling: re-written, especially to provide a clearer
            description of copying on tunnel entry/exit, by adding explanation
            (keeping tunnel encaps/decaps and PCN-marking orthogonal),
            deleting one bullet ("if the inner header's marking state is more
            sever then it is preserved" - shouldn't happen), and better
            referencing of other IETF documents.
</li>
<li>S6: Open issues: stressed that "NOTE: Potential solutions are
            out of scope for this document" and edited a couple of sentences
            that were close to solution space.

Appendix: Possible future work items</h3>

<p>This section mentions some topics that are outside the PCN WG's
      current charter, but which have been mentioned as areas of interest.
      They might be work items for: the PCN WG after a future re-chartering;
      some other IETF WG; another standards body; an operator-specific usage
      that is not standardised.
</p>
<p>NOTE: it should be crystal clear that this section discusses
      possibilities only.
</p>
<p>The first set of possibilities relate to the restrictions described
      in Section 5:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>a single PCN-domain encompasses several autonomous systems that
          do not trust each other, perhaps by using a mechanism like re-PCN,
          <a class='info' href='#Briscoe08-1'>[Briscoe08&#8209;1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Emulating Border Flow Policing using Re-PCN on Bulk Data           (work in progress),&rdquo; Sept&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>not all the nodes run PCN. For example, the PCN-domain is a
          multi-site enterprise network. The sites are connected by a VPN
          tunnel; although PCN doesn't operate inside the tunnel, the PCN
          mechanisms still work properly because of the good QoS on the
          virtual link (the tunnel). Another example is that PCN is deployed
          on the general Internet (ie widely but not universally
          deployed).
</li>
<li>applying the PCN mechanisms to other types of traffic, ie beyond
          inelastic traffic. For instance, applying the PCN mechanisms to
          traffic scheduled with the Assured Forwarding per-hop behaviour. One
          example could be flow-rate adaptation by elastic applications that
          adapt according to the pre-congestion information.
</li>
<li>the aggregation assumption doesn't hold, because the link
          capacity is too low. Measurement-based admission control is less
          accurate, with a greater risk of over-admission for instance.
</li>
<li>the applicability of PCN mechanisms for emergency use (911, GETS,
          WPS, MLPP, etc.)
</li>
</ul><p>Other possibilities include:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Probing. This is discussed in Section 16.1 below.
</li>
<li>The PCN-domain extends to the end users. The scenario is
          described in <a class='info' href='#Babiarz06'>[Babiarz06]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;SIP Controlled Admission and Preemption (work in           progress),&rdquo; Oct&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. The end users need to
          be trusted to do their own policing. If there is sufficient traffic,
          then the aggregation assumption may hold. A variant is that the
          PCN-domain extends out as far as the LAN edge switch.
</li>
<li>indicating pre-congestion through signalling messages rather than
          in-band (in the form of PCN-marked packets)
</li>
<li>the decision-making functionality is at a centralised node rather
          than at the PCN-boundary-nodes. This requires that the
          PCN-egress-node signals PCN-feedback-information to the centralised
          node, and that the centralised node signals to the PCN-ingress-node
          the decision about admission (or termination). It may need the
          centralised node and the PCN-boundary-nodes to be configured with
          each other's addresses. The centralised case is described further in
          <a class='info' href='#Tsou08'>[Tsou08]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Applicability Statement for the Use of Pre-Congestion           Notification in a Resource-Controlled Network (work in           progress),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>Signalling extensions for specific protocols (eg RSVP, NSIS). For
          example: the details of how the signalling protocol installs the
          flowspec at the PCN-ingress-node for an admitted PCN-flow; and how
          the signalling protocol carries the PCN-feedback-information.

<a name="rfc.section.16.1.1"></a><h3>16.1.1.&nbsp;
Introduction</h3>

<p>Probing is a potential mechanism to assist admission control.
</p>
<p>PCN&rsquo;s admission control, as described so far, is
          essentially a reactive mechanism where the PCN-egress-node monitors
          the pre-congestion level for traffic from each PCN-ingress-node; if
          the level rises then it blocks new flows on that
          ingress-egress-aggregate. However, it&rsquo;s possible that an
          ingress-egress-aggregate carries no traffic, and so the
          PCN-egress-node can&rsquo;t make an admission decision using the
          usual method described earlier.
</p>
<p>One approach is to be &ldquo;optimistic&rdquo; and simply admit
          the new flow. However it&rsquo;s possible to envisage a scenario
          where the traffic levels on other ingress-egress-aggregates are
          already so high that they&rsquo;re blocking new PCN-flows, and
          admitting a new flow onto this 'empty' ingress-egress-aggregate adds
          extra traffic onto a link that is already pre-congested &ndash;
          which may &lsquo;tip the balance&rsquo; so that PCN&rsquo;s flow
          termination mechanism is activated or some packets are dropped. This
          risk could be lessened by configuring on each link sufficient
          &lsquo;safety margin&rsquo; above the PCN-threshold-rate.
</p>
<p>An alternative approach is to make PCN a more proactive
          mechanism. The PCN-ingress-node explicitly determines, before
          admitting the prospective new flow, whether the
          ingress-egress-aggregate can support it. This can be seen as a
          &ldquo;pessimistic&rdquo; approach, in contrast to the
          &ldquo;optimism&rdquo; of the approach above. It involves probing: a
          PCN-ingress-node generates and sends probe packets in order to test
          the pre-congestion level that the flow would experience.
</p>
<p>One possibility is that a probe packet is just a dummy data
          packet, generated by the PCN-ingress-node and addressed to the
          PCN-egress-node.

Probing functions</h3>

<p>The probing functions are:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Make decision that probing is needed. As described above,
              this is when the ingress-egress-aggregate (or the ECMP path -
              Section 8) carries no PCN-traffic. An alternative is always to
              probe, ie probe before admitting every PCN-flow.
</li>
<li>(if required) Communicate the request that probing is needed
              &ndash; the PCN-egress-node signals to the PCN-ingress-node that
              probing is needed
</li>
<li>(if required) Generate probe traffic - the PCN-ingress-node
              generates the probe traffic. The appropriate number (or rate) of
              probe packets will depend on the PCN-marking algorithm; for
              example an excess-traffic-marking algorithm generates fewer
              PCN-marks than a threshold-marking algorithm, and so will need
              more probe packets.
</li>
<li>Forward probe packets - as far as PCN-interior-nodes are
              concerned, probe packets are handled the same as (ordinary data)
              PCN-packets, in terms of routing, scheduling and
              PCN-marking.
</li>
<li>Consume probe packets - the PCN-egress-node consumes probe
              packets to ensure that they don't travel beyond the
              PCN-domain.

<a name="rfc.section.16.1.3"></a><h3>16.1.3.&nbsp;
Discussion of rationale for probing, its downsides and open issues</h3>

<p>It is an unresolved question whether probing is really needed,
          but two viewpoints have been put forward as to why it is useful. The
          first is perhaps the most obvious: there is no PCN-traffic on the
          ingress-egress-aggregate. The second assumes that multipath routing
          ECMP is running in the PCN-domain. We now consider each in turn.
</p>
<p>The first viewpoint assumes the following:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>There is no PCN-traffic on the ingress-egress-aggregate (so a
              normal admission decision cannot be made).
</li>
<li>Simply admitting the new flow has a significant risk of
              leading to overload: packets dropped or flows terminated.
</li>
</ul><p>On the former bullet, <a class='info' href='#Eardley07'>[Eardley07]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Email to PCN WG mailing list,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>
          suggests that, during the future busy hour of a national network
          with about 100 PCN-boundary-nodes, there are likely to be
          significant numbers of aggregates with very few flows under nearly
          all circumstances.
</p>
<p>The latter bullet could occur if new flows start on many of the
          empty ingress-egress-aggregates, which together overload a link in
          the PCN-domain. To be a problem this would probably have to happen
          in a short time period (flash crowd) because, after the reaction
          time of the system, other (non-empty) ingress-egress-aggregates that
          pass through the link will measure pre-congestion and so block new
          flows. Also, flows naturally end anyway.
</p>
<p>The downsides of probing for this viewpoint are:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Probing adds delay to the admission control process.
</li>
<li>Sufficient probing traffic has to be generated to test the
              pre-congestion level of the ingress-egress-aggregate. But the
              probing traffic itself may cause pre-congestion, causing other
              PCN-flows to be blocked or even terminated - and in the flash
              crowd scenario there will be probing on many
              ingress-egress-aggregates.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
</p>
<p>The second viewpoint applies in the case where there is multipath
          routing (ECMP) in the PCN-domain. Note that ECMP is often used on
          core networks. There are two possibilities:
</p>
<p>(1) If admission control is based on measurements of the
          ingress-egress-aggregate, then the viewpoint that probing is useful
          assumes:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>there&rsquo;s a significant chance that the traffic is
              unevenly balanced across the ECMP paths, and hence there&rsquo;s
              a significant risk of admitting a flow that should be blocked
              (because it follows an ECMP path that is pre-congested) or
              blocking a flow that should be admitted.
</li>
<li>Note: <a class='info' href='#Charny07-3'>[Charny07&#8209;3]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Email to PCN WG mailing list,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> suggests unbalanced
              traffic is quite possible, even with quite a large number of
              flows on a PCN-link (eg 1000) when Assumption 3 (aggregation) is
              likely to be satisfied.
</li>
</ul>

<p>(2) If admission control is based on measurements of
          pre-congestion on specific ECMP paths, then the viewpoint that
          probing is useful assumes:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>There is no PCN-traffic on the ECMP path on which to base an
              admission decision.
</li>
<li>Simply admitting the new flow has a significant risk of
              leading to overload.
</li>
<li>The PCN-egress-node can match a packet to an ECMP path.
</li>
<li>Note: This is similar to the first viewpoint and so similarly
              could occur in a flash crowd if a new flow starts more-or-less
              simultaneously on many of the empty ECMP paths. Because there
              are several (sometimes many) ECMP paths between each pair of
              PCN-boundary-nodes, it&rsquo;s presumably more likely that an
              ECMP path is &lsquo;empty&rsquo; than an
              ingress-egress-aggregate is. To constrain the number of ECMP
              paths, a few tunnels could be set-up between each pair of
              PCN-boundary-nodes. Tunnelling also solves the issue in the
              bullet immediately above (which is otherwise hard because an
              ECMP routing decision is made independently on each node).
</li>
</ul>

<p>The downsides of probing for this viewpoint are:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Probing adds delay to the admission control process.
</li>
<li>Sufficient probing traffic has to be generated to test the
              pre-congestion level of the ECMP path. But there&rsquo;s the
              risk that the probing traffic itself may cause pre-congestion,
              causing other PCN-flows to be blocked or even terminated.
</li>
<li>The PCN-egress-node needs to consume the probe packets to
              ensure they don&rsquo;t travel beyond the PCN-domain, since they
              might confuse the destination end node. This is non-trivial,
              since probe packets are addressed to the destination end node,
              in order to test the relevant ECMP path (ie they are not
              addressed to the PCN-egress-node, unlike the first viewpoint
              above).
</li>
</ul>

<p>The open issues associated with this viewpoint include:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>What rate and pattern of probe packets does the
            PCN-ingress-node need to generate, so that there&rsquo;s enough
            traffic to make the admission decision?
</li>
<li>What difficulty does the delay (whilst probing is done), and
            possible packet drops, cause applications?
</li>
<li>Can the delay be alleviated by automatically and periodically
            probing on the ingress-egress-aggregate? Or does this add too much
            overhead?
</li>
<li>Are there other ways of dealing with the flash crowd scenario?
            For instance, by limiting the rate at which new flows are
            admitted; or perhaps by a PCN-egress-node blocking new flows on
            its empty ingress-egress-aggregates when its non-empty ones are
            pre-congested.
</li>
<li>(Second viewpoint only) How does the PCN-egress-node
            disambiguate probe packets from data packets (so it can consume
            the former)? The PCN-egress-node must match the characteristic
            setting of particular bits in the probe packet&rsquo;s header or
            body &ndash; but these bits must not be used by any
            PCN-interior-node&rsquo;s ECMP algorithm. In the general case this
            isn&rsquo;t possible, but it should be possible for a typical ECMP
            algorithm (which examines: the source and destination IP addresses
            and port numbers, the protocol ID, and the DSCP).
