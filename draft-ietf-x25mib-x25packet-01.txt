          1.1.  Revision History

          February 1992

          The February release (Editor's Internal Reference Number 1.14)
          made many changes.

               Many of the tables were combined.  For example, the
               x25InfoTable, x25PktStatTable, and x25TmrStatTable were
               combined into the x25PleTable.  The x25ConInfoTable,
               x25ConStatTable, and x25ConTimrTable were combined into
               the x25CircuitTable.

               The objects for call parameters were drastically
               reworked.  All call parameters were combined in the
               x25CallParmTable.  Any table, such as the  x25PleTable or
               x25CircuitTable, that needs to reference call parameters
               identifies an entry in the new table.  As part of this
               the x25ConDefTable was deleted and replaced with the
               x25PleDefCallParamId.

               The x25PvcTable was deleted; the x25CircuitStatus object
               provides similar information about PVCs.

               The x25ClearedCircuitTable was added to record the status
               code of cleared circuits.

               Many object definitions were restructured. For example,
               the time units for timers was changed from 1/100ths of a
               second to milliseconds.  Some indexes into tables were
               replaced with object identifiers.

               Much of the introductory text was changed and the
               references were changed to match.

          October 1992

          The October release (Editor Internal Reference Number 1.10)
          made the following changes:

               Changed x25ConInfoStatus to clarify the description and
               the pvcResetting(5) value was changed to pvcResetting(6)
               to avoid a conflict with a previous use of the number 5.

               The name of the counter object
               x25TmrStatRetryCountsExceeded was changed to
               x25TmrStatRetryCountExceededs.

               The name of the counter object
               x25TmrStatClearCountsExceeded was changed to
               x25TmrStatClearCountExceededs.

               All occurances of Guage were changed to Gauge.

               Added the x25CallFcltyTable, x25CallFcltyCcittTable, and
               x25CallParamTable.

          June 1991

          The June release corrected some syntax errors and cleaned up
          some other minor things.

          April 1991

          The April 26 release of this document was the first release.
          That version was derived from the ISO work on network layer
          management as presented in ISO/IEC 10733 [11].

          2.  Abstract

          This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
          (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-
          based internets.  In particular, it defines objects for
          managing the Packet Layer of X.25.  The objects defined here,
          along with the objects in the "SNMP MIB extension for LAPB"
          [9] and the "Definitions of Managed Objects for RS-232-like
          Hardware Devices" [8], combine to allow management of an X.25
          protocol stack.

          3.  The Network Management Framework

          The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of
          three components.  These components give the rules for
          defining objects, the definitions of objects, and the protocol
          for manipulating objects.

          The network management framework structures objects in an
          abstract information tree. The branches of the tree name
          objects and the leaves of the tree contain the values
          manipulated to effect management. This tree is called the
          Management Information Base or MIB. The concepts of this tree
          are given in RFC 1155 "The Structure of Management
          Information" or SMI [1]. The SMI defines the trunk of the tree
          and the types of objects used when defining the leaves. RFC
          1212, "Towards Concise MIB Definitions" [4], defines a more
          concise description mechanism that preserves all the
          principals of the SMI.

          The core MIB definitions for the Internet suite of protocols
          can be found in RFC 1156 [2] "Management Information Base for
          Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets". RFC 1213 [5]
          defines MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I with changes to

          Internet Draft      X.25 Packet Layer MIB        February 1992


          incorporate implementation experience and new operational
          requirements.

          RFC 1157 [3] defines the SNMP protocol itself. The protocol
          defines how to manipulate the objects in a remote MIB.

          The tree structure of the MIB allows new objects to be defined
          for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

          4.  Objects

          The definition of an object in the MIB requires an object name
          and type.  Object names and types are defined using the subset
          of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [6] defined in the SMI
          [1].  Objects are named using ASN.1 object identifiers,
          administratively assigned names, to specify object types.  The
          object name, together with an optional object instance,
          uniquely identifies a specific instance of an object.  For
          human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the
          OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to objects.

          Objects also have a syntax that defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
          language [6] provides the primitives used for this purpose.
          The SMI [1] purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may
          be used for simplicity and ease of implementation.  The
          encoding of an object type simply describes how to represent
          an object using ASN.1 encoding rules [7], for purposes of
          dealing with the SNMP protocol.

          4.1.  Format of Definitions

          Section 6 contains the specification of all object types
          defined in this MIB module.  The object types are defined
          using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the
          extensions specified in "Towards Concise MIB Definitions" [4].

          Internet Draft      X.25 Packet Layer MIB        February 1992


          5.  Overview

          5.1.  Informal Overview

          This section describes how the objects defined below relate
          with other MIBs.  This section is only informational to help
          understand how the pieces fit together.

          The objects defined below are used in conjunction with MIB-II
          and other MIBs such as the LAPB MIB [9].  A system with a
          complete X.25 stack running over a synchronous line will have
          at least two interfaces in the ifTable defined in MIB-II.
          There will be an interface for LAPB and another interface for
          the packet layer of X.25. There will also be objects defined
          in the RS-232-like MIB for the physical sync line.

          Each software interface identifies the layer below it used to
          send and receive packets. The X.25 MIB object, defined below,
          x25PleDataLinkId, specifies an instance of lapbParamIndex for
          the LAPB interface under that X.25. The LAPB object,
          lapbParamPortId, identifies an instance of the rs232PortIndex
          for the the Sync line used by LAPB.

          For X.25 running over LAPB over Ethernet, the lapbParamPortId
          would identify the instance of ifIndex for the Ethernet
          interface.

          Each X.25 subnetwork will have separate entries in the
          ifTable.  Thus a system with two X.25 lines would have two
          ifTable entries for the two X.25 packet layers and two other
          entries for the two LAPB interfaces. Each X.25 Packet Layer
          MIB would identify the instance of the LAPB MIB for the
          interface below it. Each LAPB MIB would identify the Sync line
          below it. The system would also have two entries for
          rs232PortTable and rs232SyncPortTable for the two physical
          lines.

          Since the ifTable as defined in MIB-II is device independent,
          it doesn't have anything specific for any type of interface.
          The objects below define the X.25 packet layer specific
          information for an interface of type X.25. Different X.25
          interfaces can also be differentiated by matching the values
          of ifIndex with x25PleIndex.

          5.2.  Textual Conventions

          This MIB introduces a new data type as a textual convention
          for use with X.25.  This textual convention enhances the
          readability of the specification and can ease comparison with
          other specifications if appropriate.  It should be noted that
          the introduction of such textual conventions has no effect on
          either the syntax nor the semantics of any managed objects.
          These conventions are merely an artifact of the explanatory
          method used.  Objects defined in terms of one of these methods
          are always encoded by means of the rules that define the
          primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are
          necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are
          adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in
          pursuit of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous
          MIB documents.

          This MIB introduces the data type of:

                    X25address

          5.3.  Structure of MIB

          Instances of the objects defined below represent attributes of
          an X.25 Packet Layer interface.  At present these interfaces
          are identified by an ifType object in the Internet-standard
          MIB [5] of:

                    ddn-x25(4), and
                    rfc887-x25(5).

          For these interfaces, the value of the ifSpecific variable in
          the MIB-II [5] has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:

                    x25    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { To Be Assigned }

          The objects defined below are similar to those defined in a
          draft ISO document for X.25 management [11]. Some object
          definitions also reference the ISO specification for X.25 [10]
          to specify  the section that will give the reader addition
          information relative to the object.  Access to those documents
          maybe useful (but isn't essential) to understand the names and
          semantics of some objects.  The similarity of these objects
          with the ISO objects minimizes the instrumentation required by
          those systems that support both OSI and TCP/IP management

          Internet Draft      X.25 Packet Layer MIB        February 1992


          protocols.

          Since the objects defined here are extensions to the Internet
          Standard MIB [2] and thus also an extension of the second
          version, MIB-II [5], the objects defined here explicitly do
          not duplicate objects defined in existing standards.  In some
          instances clarification of how to apply those objects has been
          given.

          The relationship between an X.25 Packet Layer interface and an
          interface in the context of the Internet-standard MIB [5] is
          one-to-one. As such, the value of an ifIndex object instance
          can be directly used to identify corresponding instances of
          the objects defined below.
