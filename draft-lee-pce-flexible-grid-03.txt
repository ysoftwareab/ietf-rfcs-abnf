1. Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC4655], [RFC5440]
   and [RFC7698].

2. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



3. Introduction

   [RFC4655] defines a PCE based path computation architecture and
   explains how a Path Computation Element (PCE) may compute Label
   Switched Paths (LSP) in Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic
   Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks at the
   request of Path Computation Clients (PCCs).  A PCC is said to be any
   network component that makes such a request and may be, for
   instance, an Optical Switching Element within a Wavelength Division
   Multiplexing (WDM) network.  The PCE, itself, can be located
   anywhere within the network, and may be within an optical switching
   element, a Network Management System (NMS) or Operational Support
   System (OSS), or may be an independent network server.

   The PCE communications Protocol (PCEP) is the communication protocol
   used between a PCC and a PCE, and may also be used between
   cooperating PCEs.  [RFC4657] sets out the common protocol
   requirements for PCEP.  Additional application-specific requirements
   for PCEP are deferred to separate documents.

   [PCEP-WSON] provides the PCEP extensions for the support of Routing
   and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) in Wavelength Switched Optical
   Networks (WSON) based on the requirements specified in [RFC6163] and
   [RFC7449].

   [RFC7698] provides Framework and Requirements for GMPLS-Based
   Control of Flexi-Grid Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)

   Networks. To allow efficient allocation of optical spectral
   bandwidth for systems that have high bit-rates, the International
   Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector
   (ITU-T) has extended its Recommendations G.694.1 and G.872 to
   include a new Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) grid by
   defining a set of nominal central frequencies, channel spacings, and
   the concept of the "frequency slot". In such an environment, a data-
   plane connection is switched based on allocated, variable-sized
   frequency ranges within the optical spectrum, creating what is known
   as a flexible grid (flexi-grid).

   This document provides PCEP extensions to support Routing and
   Spectrum Assignment (RSA) in in Spectrum Switched Optical Networks
   (SSON)[RFC7698].

   Figure 2 shows one typical PCE based implementation, which is
   referred to as the Combined Routing and Spectrum Assignment (R&SA)
   [RFC7698]. With this architecture, the two processes of routing and
   spectrum assignment are accessed via a single PCE. This architecture
   is the base architecture from which the PCEP extensions are going to
   be specified in this document.

4. Spectrum Assignment (SA) Object

   Spectrum allocation can be performed by the PCE by different means:

     (a) By means of Explicit Label Control (ELC) where the PCE
     allocates which label to use for each interface/node along the
     path.

     (b) By means of a Label Set where the PCE provides a range of
     potential frequency slots to allocate by each node along the path.
     This document aligns with GMPLS extensions for PCEP [PCEP-GMPLS]
     for generic property such as label, label-set and label assignment


Lee et al.              Expires December 2018                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     PCEP Extension for Flexible Grid        October 2018


     noting that frequency is a type of label. Frequency restrictions
     and constraints are also formulated in terms of labels per
     [RFC7579].

   Option (b) allows distributed spectrum allocation (performed during
   signaling) to complete spectrum assignment.

   Additionally, given a range of potential spectrums to allocate, the
   request SHOULD convey the heuristic / mechanism to the allocation.

   The format of a PCReq message after incorporating the Spectrum
   Assignment (SA) object is as follows:

   <PCReq Message> ::= <Common Header>

                          [<svec-list>]

                          <request-list>

      Where:

         <request-list>::=<request>[<request-list>]

         <request>::= <RP>

                      <GENERALIZED ENDPOINTS>

                      [ <SA> ]

                      [other optional objects...]

   If the SA object is present in the request, it MUST be encoded after
   the ENDPOINTS object.

   The format of the Spectrum Assignment (SA) object body is as
   follows:

   0                   1                   2                   3

   o  Reserved (16 bits)

   o  Flags (16 bits)

   The following new flags SHOULD be set

     . M (Mode - 1 bit): M bit is used to indicate the mode of
        spectrum assignment. When M bit is set to 1, this indicates
        that the spectrum assigned by the PCE must be explicit. That
        is, the selected way to convey the allocated spectrum is by
        means of Explicit Label Control (ELC) [RFC4003] for each hop of
        a computed LSP. Otherwise, the spectrum assigned by the PCE
        needs not be explicit (i.e., it can be suggested in the form of
        label set objects in the corresponding response, to allow
        distributed SA. In such case, the PCE MUST return a Label Set
        Field as described in Section 2.6 of [RFC7579] in the response.
        See Section 5 of this document for the encoding discussion of a
        Label Set Field in a PCRep message.



4.1. Frequency-Slot Selection TLV

   The Frequency-Slot Selection TLV is used to indicate the frequency-
   slot selection constraint in regard to the order of frequency-slot
   assignment to be returned by the PCE. This TLV is only applied when
   M bit is set in the SA Object specified in Section 3.1. This TLV
   MUST NOT be used when the M bit is cleared.

   The Frequency-Slot Selection sub-TLV value field is defined as:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   Where:

      S (Symmetry, 1 bit):  This flag is only meaningful when the
request is for a bidirectional LSP (see [RFC5440]).

      0 denotes requiring the same frequency-slot in both directions;
      1 denotes that different spectrums on both directions are
      allowed.

      Frequency-Slot Assignment (FSA) Method (7 bits):

      0: unspecified (any); This does not constrain the SA method
         used by a PCC  This value is implied when the
         Frequency-Slot Selection sub-TLV is absent.

      1: First-Fit.  All the feasible frequency slots are numbered
         (based on "n" parameter), and this SA method chooses the
         available frequency-slot with the lowest index (of "n"
         parameter).

      2: Random.  This SA method chooses an feasible frequency-slot
         ("n" paramerer) randomly.

      3-127: Unassigned.

      The processing rules for this TLV are as follows:

      If a PCE does not support the attribute(s), its
      behavior is specified below:

      -  S bit not supported: a PathErr MUST be generated with the
         Error Code "Routing Problem" (24) with error sub-code
         "Unsupported Frequency slot Selection Symmetry value" (TDB).

      -  FSA method not supported: a PathErr MUST be generated with the
         Error Code "Routing Problem" (24) with error sub-code

Internet-Draft     PCEP Extension for Flexible Grid        October 2018


         "Unsupported Frequency Slot Assignment value" (TDB).

   A Frequency Slot Selection TLV can be constructed by a node and
   added to an ERO Hop Attributes subobject in order to be processed
   by downstream nodes (transit and egress).  As defined in
   [RFC7570], the R bit reflects the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE and
   LSP_ATTRIBUTE semantic defined in [RFC5420], and it SHOULD be set
   accordingly.

   Once a node properly parses the Spectrum Selection sub-TLV
   received in an ERO Hop Attributes subobject, the node use the
   indicated spectrum assignment method (at that hop) for the LSP.
   In addition, the node SHOULD report compliance by adding an RRO
   Hop Attributes subobject with the WSON Processing Hop Attribute
   TLV (and its sub-TLVs) that indicate the utilized method.
   Frequency-Slot Selection TLVs carried in an RRO Hop Attributes
   subobject are subject to [RFC7570] and standard RRO processing;
   see [RFC3209].



4.2. Frequency-slot Restriction Constraint TLV

   For any request that contains a Frequency-slot assignment, the
   requester (PCC) MUST be able to specify a restriction on the
   frequency-slots to be used. This restriction is to be interpreted by
   the PCE as a constraint on the tuning ability of the origination
   laser transmitter or on any other maintenance related constraints.

   The format of the Frequency-Slot Restriction Constraint TLV is as
   follows:

   <Frequency-lot Restriction Constraint> ::=

                  <Action> <Count> <Reserved>

                  (<Link Identifiers> <Freq-slot Restriction>)...

   Where

   <Link Identifiers> ::= <Link Identifier> [<Link Identifiers>]

   See Section 4.3.1 in [PCEP-WSON] for the encoding of the Link
   Identifiers Field.

   The Frequency slot Restriction Constraint TLV type is TBD. This TLV
   MAY appear more than once to be able to specify multiple
   restrictions.

   The TLV data is defined as follows:



   0                   1                   2                   3

   o  Action: 8 bits


      .  0 - Inclusive List indicates that one or more link identifiers
         are included in the Link Set. Each identifies a separate link
         that is part of the set.

      .  1 - Inclusive Range indicates that the Link Set defines a
         range of links.  It contains two link identifiers. The first
         identifier indicates the start of the range (inclusive). The
         second identifier indicates the end of the range (inclusive).
         All links with numeric values between the bounds are
         considered to be part of the set. A value of zero in either
         position indicates that there is no bound on the corresponding
         portion of the range. Note that the Action field can be set to
         0 when unnumbered link identifier is used.

   o  Count: The number of the link identifiers (8 bits)

   Note that a PCC MAY add a spectrum restriction that applies to all
   links by setting the Count field to zero and specifying just a set
   of spectrums.

   Note that all link identifiers in the same list must be of the same
   type.

   o  Reserved: Reserved for future use (16 bits)


   o  Link Identifiers: Identifies each link ID for which restriction
   is applied. The length is dependent on the link format and the Count
   field. See Section 4.3.1 in [PCEP-WSON] for Link Identifier encoding
   and Section 3.3.1 for the Spectrum Restriction Field encoding,
   respectively.

   o  Type (16 bits): The type of the TLV.

   o  Length (15 bits): The length of the TLV including the Type and
                        Length fields.

   o  M (Mode): 1 bit


      -  0 indicates the allocation is under Explicit Label Control.

      -  1 indicates the allocation is expressed in Label Sets.


   Note that all link identifiers in the same list must be of the same
   type.


   o  Link Identifier (variable): Identifies the interface to which
   assignment spectrum(s) is applied. See Section 3.3 for Link
   Identifier encoding.

   o  Allocated Spectrum(s) (variable): Indicates the allocated
   spectrum(s) to the link identifier. See Section 3.3.1 for encoding
   details.

   This TLV is encoded as an attributes TLV, per [RFC5420], which is
   carried in the ERO LSP Attribute Subobjects per [RFC7570]. The type
   value of the Spectrum Restriction Constraint TLV is TBD by IANA.


5.1. Error Indicator

   To indicate errors associated with the RSA request, a new Error Type
   (TDB) and subsequent error-values are defined as follows for
   inclusion in the PCEP-ERROR Object:

Internet-Draft     PCEP Extension for Flexible Grid        October 2018


   A new Error-Type (TDB) and subsequent error-values are defined as
   follows:

      .  Error-Type=TBD; Error-value=1: if a PCE receives a RSA request
         and the PCE is not capable of processing the request due to
         insufficient memory, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with a
         PCEP-ERROR Object (Error-Type=TDB) and an Error-value(Error-
         value=1).  The PCE stops processing the request.  The
         corresponding RSA request MUST be cancelled at the PCC.

      .  Error-Type=TBD; Error-value=2: if a PCE receives a RSA request
         and the PCE is not capable of RSA computation, the PCE MUST
         send a PCErr message with a PCEP-ERROR Object (Error-Type=TDB)
         and an Error-value (Error-value=2). The PCE stops processing
         the request.  The corresponding RSA computation MUST be
         cancelled at the PCC.




5.2. NO-PATH Indicator


   To communicate the reason(s) for not being able to find RSA for the
   path request, the NO-PATH object can be used in the corresponding
   response.  The format of the NO-PATH object body is defined in
   [RFC5440].  The object may contain a NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV to provide
   additional information about why a path computation has failed.

   One new bit flag is defined to be carried in the Flags field in the
   NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV carried in the NO-PATH Object.

      .  Bit TDB: When set, the PCE indicates no feasible route was
         found that meets all the constraints (e.g., spectrum
         restriction, etc.) associated with RSA.



6. Manageability Considerations

   Manageability of SSON Routing and Spectrum Assignment (RSA) with PCE
   must address the following considerations:

Internet-Draft     PCEP Extension for Flexible Grid        October 2018


6.1. Control of Function and Policy

   In addition to the parameters already listed in Section 8.1 of
   [RFC5440], a PCEP implementation SHOULD allow configuring the
   following PCEP session parameters on a PCC:

      .  The ability to send a Flexi-Grid RSA request.

   In addition to the parameters already listed in Section 8.1 of
   [RFC5440], a PCEP implementation SHOULD allow configuring the
   following PCEP session parameters on a PCE:

      .  The support for Flexi-Grid RSA .

      .  A set of Flexi-Grid RSA specific policies (authorized sender,
         request rate limiter, etc).


   These parameters may be configured as default parameters for any
   PCEP session the PCEP speaker participates in, or may apply to a
   specific session with a given PCEP peer or a specific group of
   sessions with a specific group of PCEP peers.


6.2. Information and Data Models

   Extensions to the PCEP YANG module may include to cover the Flexi-
   Grid RSA information introduced in this document. Liveness Detection
   and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in section 8.3 of [RFC5440].


6.3. Verifying Correct Operation

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   section 8.4 of [RFC5440]


6.4. Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components

   The PCE Discovery mechanisms ([RFC5089] and [RFC5088]) may be used
   to advertise Flexi-Grid RSA path computation capabilities to PCCs.

Internet-Draft     PCEP Extension for Flexible Grid        October 2018


   This draft has requirements on other protocols (ERO objects, etc.
   which are under TEAS or CCAMP.)




6.5. Impact on Network Operation

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new network
   operation requirements in addition to those already listed in
   section 8.6 of [RFC5440].



7. Security Considerations

   This document has no requirement for a change to the security models
   within PCEP. However, the additional information distributed in
   order to address the RSA problem represents a disclosure of network
   capabilities that an operator may wish to keep private.
   Consideration should be given to securing this information.



8. IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains a registry of PCEP parameters. IANA has made
   allocations from the sub-registries as described in the following
   sections.

8.1. New PCEP Object

   As described in Section 4.1, a new PCEP Object is defined to carry
   frequency-slot assignment related constraints. IANA is to allocate
   the following from "PCEP Objects" sub-registry
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/pcep/pcep.xhtml#pcep-objects):



   Object Class   Name  Object                     Reference

8.4. New PCEP TLV: Spectrum Allocation TLV

   As described in Section 5, a new PCEP TLV is defined to indicate the
   allocation of freq-slots(s) by the PCE in response to a request by
   the PCC. IANA is to allocate this new TLV from the "PCEP TLV Type
   Indicators" subregistry
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/pcep/pcep.xhtml#pcep-tlv-type-
   indicators).

   Value             Description                Reference

8.5. New No-Path Reasons

   As described in Section 4.3, a new bit flag are defined to be
   carried in the Flags field in the NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV carried in the
   NO-PATH Object. This flag, when set, indicates that no feasible
   route was found that meets all the RSA constraints (e.g., spectrum
   restriction, signal compatibility, etc.) associated with a RSA path
   computation request.

   IANA is to allocate this new bit flag from the "PCEP NO-PATH-VECTOR
   TLV Flag Field" subregistry
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/pcep/pcep.xhtml#no-path-vector-
   tlv).

   Bit         Description                Reference
   -----------------------------------------------------
   TBD         No RSA constraints met     [This.I-D]

8.6. New Error-Types and Error-Values

   As described in Section 5.1, new PCEP error codes are defined for
   WSON RWA errors. IANA is to allocate from the ""PCEP-ERROR Object
   Error Types and Values" sub-registry
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/pcep/pcep.xhtml#pcep-error-object).
