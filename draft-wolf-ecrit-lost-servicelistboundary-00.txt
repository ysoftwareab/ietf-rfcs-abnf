Abstract

   LoST [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost] is able to map service identifiers and
   location information to service contact URIs.  If a LoST client wants
   to discover available services for a particular location, it will
   perform a <listServicesByLocation> query to the LoST server.
   However, the response from the LoST server does not give information
   about the geographical region, for which the returned service list is
   valid.  Therefore this document proposes a ServiceListBoundary, in
   addition to the ServiceBoundary (which indicates the region a
   specific service URL is valid).

Internet-Draft             serviceListBoundary                  May 2008


1.  Introduction

   Location based service providers as well as Public Safety Answering
   Points only serve a specific geographic region.  Therefore the LoST
   protocol defines the ServiceBoundary, which indicates the service
   region for a specific service URL.  However, not all services are
   available everywhere.  Clients can discover available services for a
   particular location by the <listServicesByLocation> query.  The LoST
   server returns a list of services that are available at this
   particular location.  But the server does not inform the client, for
   which geographical region the returned service list is valid.  This
   may lead to the situation where a client initially discovered all
   available services by the <listServicesByLocation> query, and then
   moves to a different location while refreshing the service mappings,
   but does not notice the availability of another service.  The
   following imaginary example illustrates the problem for emergency
   calling:

   The client is powered-up, does location determination (resulting in
   location A) and performs an initial <listServicesByLocation> query
   with location A requesting urn:services:sos.

   The LoST server returns the following services list:

   urn:service:sos.police
   urn:service:sos.ambulance
   urn:service:sos.fire

   The client does the initial LoST mapping and discovers the
   dialstrings for these services.  Then the client moves, refreshing
   the service mappings when necessary as told by the ServiceBoundary.
   However, when arriving in location B (close to a mountain), service:
   sos:mountainrescue is available (which is not available in location
   A).  Nevertheless, the client does not detect this, because only the
   initially learned services (police, ambulance, fire) are refreshed.
   Consequently the dialstring for the mountainrescue is not known by
   the client, and the emergency call to the mountainrescue will
   certainly fail.

   Note that the ServiceBoundary (service region for an individual
   service) cannot be considered as an indicator for the region a
   specific service list is valid for.  The service list may even change
   within the ServiceBoundary of another service.  For example, the
   ambulance mapping is valid for a whole state, but for a part of the
   state there is an additional mountain rescue service.

   Consequently, there are two ways to tackle this issue:

   o  clients continuously ask for the service list (although it may not
      have changed)
   o  an additional boundary indicating the region, a specific service
      list is valid for (in the style of the ServiceBoundary)

   Since the LoST protocol has the ServiceBoundary concept in order to
   avoid that clients continuously try to refresh the mapping of a
   specific service, a ServiceListBoundary would provide a similar
   mechanism for service lists.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  LoST Extensions

   This chapter describes the necessary modifications to the LoST
   protocol in order to support the proposed ServiceListBoundary in a
   similar way as the ServiceBoundary.

3.1.  Extensions to <ListServiceByLocation>

   The query <ListServicesByLocation> may contain an additional
   serviceListBoundary attribute to request the boundary for the service
   list returned, either by value or by reference.

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <listServicesByLocation
        xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:lost1"
        xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml"
        serviceListBoundary="value"
        recursive="true">
        <location id="mylocation" profile="geodetic-2d">
          <gml:Point srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326">
            <gml:pos>48.1454 16.3774</gml:pos>
          </gml:Point>
        </location>
        <service>urn:service:sos</service>
      </listServicesByLocation>

   A possible response is shown below:

Internet-Draft             serviceListBoundary                  May 2008


      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <listServicesByLocationResponse
       xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:lost1">
       <serviceList expires="2010-01-01T00:00:00Z">
        urn:service:sos.ambulance
        urn:service:sos.fire
        urn:service:sos.gas
        urn:service:sos.mountain
        urn:service:sos.poison
        urn:service:sos.police
       </serviceList>
       <path>
        <via source="resolver.example"/>
        <via source="authoritative.example"/>
       </path>
       <locationUsed id="mylocation"/>
       <serviceListBoundary
         profile="civic">
         <civicAddress
           xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr">
           <country>AT</country>
           <A1>Lower Austria</A1>
         </civicAddress>
       </serviceListBoundary>
      </listServicesByLocationResponse>


   This exemplary response indicates that the service list is valid for
   Lower Austria.  The <listServicesByLocation> request has to be
   repeated only when moving out of Lower Austria.  However, the
   mappings of the services itself may have other service boundaries.
   Additionally, the expires attribute indicates the absolute time when
   this service list becomes invalid.

   The boundary can also be requested by reference when setting the
   attribute serviceListBoundary to "reference".  Then the response
   contains a serviceListBoundaryReference element:

          <serviceListBoundaryReference
            source="authoritative.example"
            key="123567890123567890123567890" />


3.2.  Retrieving the serviceList Boundary via getServiceListBoundary

   In order to retrieve the boundary for a specific service list, the
   client issues a <getServiceListBoundary> request, similar to the
   <getServiceBoundary> request.

   An example is shown below:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <getServiceListBoundary xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:lost1"
          key="123567890123567890123567890"/>


   The LoST server response is shown below:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <getServiceListBoundaryResponse
        xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:lost1">
        <serviceBoundary profile="civic" expires="2010-01-01T00:00:00Z">
          <civicAddress
            xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr">
            <country>US</country>
            <A1>New York</A1>
            <A3>New York</A3>
          </civicAddress>
        </serviceBoundary>
        <path>
          <via source="resolver.example"/>
          <via source="authoritative.example"/>
        </path>
      </getServiceListBoundaryResponse>


3.3.  Service List Boundary

   The service list boundary indicates a region within which all
   <listServicesByLocation> queries with the same service identifiers
   result in the same serviceList.  A service list boundary may consist
   of geometric shapes (both in civic and geodetic location format), and
   may be non-contiguous, like the service boundary.

   The mapping of the specific services within the service list boundary
   may be different at different locations.

   There is no need to include boundary information to a
   <listServiceResponse>. <ListServices> requests are purely for
   diagnostic purposes and do not contain location information at all,
   so no boundary information is reasonable.

   Security considerations are discussed in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost].
