Overview</h3>

<p>The Internet Protocol, specifically <a class='info' href='#RFC0791'>IPv4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Internet Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC0791] and <a class='info' href='#RFC2460'>IPv6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Deering, S. and R. Hinden, &ldquo;Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2460],
      employ a connectionless hop-by-hop packet forwarding paradigm. A host
      connected to an IP network that wishes to communicate with another host
      on the network generates an IP packet with source and destination IP
      addressing information, among other options.
</p>
<p>At the IP Network Layer, or Internet Layer, there is typically no
      required transactional state when communicating with other hosts on the
      network. Hosts generating packets for transmission have the opportunity
      to spoof (forge) the source address of packets which they transmit.
</p>
<p>Source address verification is necessary in order to detect and
      reject spoofed packets and contribute to the overall security of IP
      networks. In particular, source address verification techniques enable
      detection and rejection of spoofed packets, and also implicitly provide
      some assurances that the source address in an IP packet is legitimately
      assigned to the system that generated the packet.
</p>
<p>Solutions such as <a class='info' href='#RFC2827'>BCP 38<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ferguson, P. and D. Senie, &ldquo;Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks which employ IP Source Address Spoofing,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2827] provide
      guidelines for one such technique for network ingress filtering.
      However, if these techniques are not implemented at the ingress point of
      the IP network, then the validity of the source address can not be
      positively ascertained. Furthermore, BCP 38 only implies source address
      verification at the Internet Layer, and is most often implemented on IP
      subnetwork address boundaries. One of the difficulties in encouraging
      the deployment of BCP 38 is that there is relatively little benefit
      until it is very widely deployed, which is not yet the case. The local
      application of the principle of BCP 38 fortunately has local benefit,
      even before BCP 38 is fully deployed. It also helps get the Internet
      towards a state where BCP 38 is more widely followed.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that while BCP 38 directs providers to provide
      protection from spoofed prefixes, it is clearly desirable for enterprise
      operators to provide that protection more locally, and with better
      tracability.  This allows the enterprise to be a better Internet participant,
      and to quickly detect and remedy problems when they occur.
</p>
<p>Also, there is a possibility that in a LAN environment where multiple hosts
      share a single LAN or IP port on a switch or router, one of those hosts
      may spoof the source addresses of other hosts within the local subnet.
      Understanding these threats and the relevant topologies in which they're
      introduced is critical when assessing the threats that exists with
      source address spoofing.
</p>
<p>The aim of this document is to provide some additional details
      regarding spoofed-based threat vectors, and discuss implications of
      various network topologies.

Spoofed-based Attack Vectors</h3>

<p>Spoofing is employed on the Internet for a number of reasons, most of
      which are in some manner associated with malicious or otherwise
      nefarious activities. In general, two classes of spoofed-based attack
      vectors exists; blind attacks and non-blind attacks. The follow sections
      provide some information of blind and non-blind attacks.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Blind Attacks</h3>

<p>Blind attacks typically occur when an attacker isn't on the same
        local area network as a source or target, or when an attacker has no
        access to the datapath between the attack source(s) and the target
        systems. The result is that they have no access to legitimate source
        and target systems.

Single Packet Attacks</h3>

<p>One type of blind attacks, which we'll refer to here as "single
          packet DoS attacks", involves an attacking system injecting spoofed
          information into the network which results in either a complete
          crash of the target system, or in some manner poisons some network
          configuration or other information on a target system such to impact
          network or other services.
</p>
<p>An example of an attack that can cause a receiving system to
          crash is a LAND attack. A LAND attack packet would consist of an
          attacking system forwarding a packet (e.g., TCP SYN) to a target
          system that contains both a source and destination address of that
          target system. The target system would "lock up" when creating
          connection state associated with the packet, or would get stuck in a
          state where it continuously replies to itself.
</p>
<p>Another class of a single packet attacks involves an attacker
          poisoning network or DNS cache information, perhaps in order
          to simply break a given hosts connection, enable MITM or other
          attacks. Network level attacks that could involve single packet DoS
          include ARP cache poisoning and ICMP redirects.  The most obvious 
          example which depends upon faslifying an IP source address is an 
          on-link attacker poisoning a routers ARP or ND cache.  The ability 
          to forge a source address can also be helpful in causing a DNS 
          cache to accept and use incorrect information.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.2"></a><h3>3.1.2.&nbsp;
Flood-Based DoS</h3>

<p>Flooding-based DoS attack vectors are particularly effective
          attacks on the Internet today. They usually entail flooding a large
          number of packets towards a target system, with the hopes of either
          exhausting connection state on the target system, consuming all
          packet processing capabilities of the target or intermediate
          systems, or consuming a great deal of bandwidth available to the
          target system such that they are essentially inaccessible.
</p>
<p>Because these attacks require no reply from the target system and
          require no legitimate transaction state, attackers often attempt to
          obfuscate the identity of the systems that are generating the attack
          traffic by spoofing the source IP address of the attacking traffic
          flows. Because ingress filtering isn't applied ubiquitously on the
          Internet today, spoof-based flooding attack vectors are typically
          very difficult to traceback. In particular, there may be one or more
          attacking sources beyond your network border, and the attacking
          sources may or may not be legitimate sources, it's difficult to
          discriminate if the sources are not directly connected to the local
          routing system.
</p>
<p>Common flood-based DoS attack vectors today include SYN floods,
          ICMP floods, and IP fragmentation attacks. Attackers may use a
          single legitimate or spoofed fixed attacking source addresses,
          although frequently they cycle through large swaths of address
          space. As a result, mitigating these attacks on the receiving end
          with source- based policies is extremely difficult.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the motivator for spoof-based DoS attacks may
          actually be to encourage the target to filter explicitly on a given
          set of source addresses, or order to disrupt the legitimate owner(s)
          access to the target system.

Poisoning Attacks</h3>

<p>While poison attacks can often be done with single packets,
          it is also true that a stream of packets can be used to find a
          window where the target will accept the incorrect information.
          In general, this can be used to perform broadly the same kinds
          of poinsonings as above, with more versatility.

Reflective Attacks</h3>

<p>DNS reflective amplification attacks are a particularly potent
          DoS attack vector on the Internet today. Like other amplification
          attacks, an attack source generates a packet with a source-spoofed
          address mapping to that of the target system. The packet, upon
          receipt by the victim or some intermediate node, typically elicits a
          large reply message, which is directed to the target of the attack.
          The amplification factor observed for attacks targeting DNS root and
          other top level domain name infrastructure in early 2006 was on the
          order of 76:1. The result is that just 15 attacking sources with
          512k of upstream attack bandwidth could generate one Gbps of
          response attack traffic towards a target system.
</p>
<p>Smurf attacks employ a similar reflective amplification attack
          vector, exploiting traditional default IP subnet directed broadcast
          address behaviors that would result in all the active hosts on a
          given subnet responding to (spoofed) ICMP echo request from an
          attacker, and generating a large amount of ICMP echo response
          traffic directed towards a target system. They were particularly
          effective in large campus LAN environments where 50k or more hosts
          might reside on a single subnet.

Accounting Subversion</h3>

<p>If an attacker wishes to distribute content or other material in
          a manner that employs protocols that require only uni-directional
          flooding and generate no end-end transactional state, they may
          desire to spoof the source IP address of that content in order to
          avoid detection or accounting functions enabled at the IP layer.
          While this particular attack has not been observed, it is included
          here to reflect the range of power that spoofed addresses may have
          even without the ability to receive responses.

Other Blind Spoofing Attacks</h3>

<p>Other Blind spoofing attacks might include spoofing in order to
          exploit source routing or other policy based routing implemented in
          a network. It may also be possible in some environments to use
          spoofing techniques to perform blind or non-blind attacks on the
          routers in a site or in the Internet. There are many techniques to
          mitigate these attacks, but it is well known that there are
          vulnerabilities in this area.  Among other attacks, if there are 
          multiple rotuers on-link with hosts, a host may be able to cause
          problems for the routing system by replaying modified or unmodified
          routing packets as if they came from another router.

Non-Blind Attacks</h3>

        attack vectors is known as man in the middle attacks.

Man in the Middle (MITM)</h3>

<p>Connection Hijacking is one of the more common man in the middle
          attack vectors. In order to hijack a connection an attacker usually
          needs to be in the forwarding path and often times employs TCP RST
          or other attacks in order to reset a transaction. The attacker may
          have already compromised a system that's in the forwarding path, or
          they may which to insert themselves in the forwarding path.
</p>
<p>For example, an attacker with access to a host on LAN segment may
          wish to redirect all the traffic on the local segment destined for a
          default gateway address (or all addresses) to itself in order to
          perform man-in-the-middle attacks. In order to accomplish this the
          attacker might transmit gratuitous ARP <a class='info' href='#RFC0826'>[RFC0826]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Plummer, D., &ldquo;Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol: Or converting network protocol addresses to 48.bit Ethernet address for transmission on Ethernet hardware,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1982.</span><span>)</span></a> messages or ARP replies to the Ethernet
          broadcast address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, notifying all the hosts on the
          segment that the IP address(es) of the target(s) now map to it's own
          MAC address. If the port to which the attacker is connected were to
          implement policy that binds a single Link Layer and IP address tuple
          to that port upon initial provisioning, spoofed packets, at the Link
          Layer and/or Network Layer, would be discarded on ingress.

Third Party Recon</h3>

<p>Another example of sighted attack isthird party reconnaissance.
          The use of spoofed addresses, while not necessary for this, can often
          provide additional information, and helps mask the tracability of the 
          activity.   The attack involves sending packets
          towards a given target system and observing either target or
          intermediate system responses. For example, if an attacker were to
          source spoof TCP SYN packets towards a target system from a large
          set of source addresses, and observe responses from that target
          system or some intermediate firewall or other middle box, they would
          be able to identify what IP layer filtering policies may be in place
          to protect that system.

Current Anti-Spoofing Solutions</h3>

<p>The first requirement is to eliminate datagrams with spoofed
      addresses from the Internet. Identifying and dropping datagrams whose
      source address is incompatible with the Internet topology at sites where
      the relationship between the source address and topology can be checked
      can eliminate such datagrams. For example, Internet devices can confirm
      that: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The IP source address is appropriate for the lower layer address
          (they both identify the same system)
</li>
<li>The IP source address is appropriate for the device at the layer
          2 switch port (the address was assigned to a, and perhaps the,
          system that uses that port)
</li>
<li>The prefix to which the IP source address belongs is appropriate
          for the part of the network topology from which the IP datagram was
          received (while the individual system may be unknown, it is
          reasonable to believe that the system is located in that part of the
          network).
</li>
</ul>

<p>Filtering points farther away from the source of the datagram can
      make decreasingly authoritative assertions about the validity of the
      source address in the datagram. Nonetheless, there is value in dropping
      traffic that is clearly inappropriate, and in maintaining knowledge of
      the level of trust one can place in an address.

Host to link layer neighbor via switch</h3>

<p>The first point at which a datagram with a spoofed address can be
        detected is on the link to which the source of the datagram is
        connected. At this point in the network, the source Link Layer and IP
        addresses are both available, and can be verified against each other.
        A datagram in which the IP source address does not match the
        corresponding Link Layer address can be discarded. Of course, the
        trust in the filtering depends on the trust in the method through
        which the mappings are developed.  This mechanism can be applied
        by a first hop router, or switch on the link.  The first hop switch 
        has the most precise information for this.
</p>
<p>On a truly shared medium link, such as classic Ethernet, 
        the best that can be
        done is to verify the Link Layer and IP addresses against the
        mappings. When the link is not shared, such as when the hosts are
        connected through a switch, the source host can be identified
        precisely based on the port through which the datagram is received or
        the MAC address if it is known to the switch. Port identification
        prevents transmission of malicious datagrams whose Link Layer and IP
        addresses are both spoofed to mimic another host.

Upstream routers</h3>

<p>Beyond the first hop router, subsequent routers may additionally
        filter traffic from downstream networks. Because these routers do not
        have access to the Link Layer address of the device from which the
        datagram was sent, they are limited to confirming that the source IP
        address is within a prefix that is appropriate for downstream router
        from which the datagram was received.
</p>
<p>Options include the use of simple access lists or the use of
        unicast reverse path filtering (uRPF). Access lists are generally
        appropriate only for the simplest cases, as management can be
        difficult. Strict Unicast RPF accepts the source address on a datagram
        if and only if it comes from a direction that would be rational to
        send a datagram directed to the address, which means that the filter
        is derived from routing information. These filtering procedures are

</p>
<p>The question that the ISP must answer for itself is the degree to
        which it trusts its downstream network. A contract might be written
        between an ISP and its customer requiring that the customer apply the
        procedures of network ingress filtering to the customer's own network,

ISP NNI Router to ISP NNI Router</h3>

<p>The considerations explicitly related to customer networks can also
        be applied to neighboring ISPs. An interconnection agreement might be
        written between two companies requiring network ingress filtering
        policy be implemented on all customers connections. ISPs might, for
        example, mark datagrams from neighboring ISPs that do not sign such a
        contract or demonstrably do not behave in accordance with it as
        'untrusted'. Alternatively, the ISP might place untrusted prefixes
        into a separate BGP community and use that to advertise the level of
        trust to its BGP peers.
</p>
<p>In this case, uRPF is less effective as a verification tool, due to
        asymmetric routing. However, when it can be shown that spoofed
        addresses are present, the procedure can be applied.

Manual Binding</h3>

<p>Binding of a single Link Layer and Network Layer address to a
          port may initially seem trivial. However, two primary areas exist
          that can complicate such techniques. In particular, these area
          involves topologies where more than a single IP layer address may be
          associated with a MAC address on a given port, or where multiple
          hosts are connected to a single IP port. Furthermore, if one or more
          dynamic address allocation mechanisms such as DHCP are employed,
          then some mechanism must exist to associate those IP layer addresses
          with the appropriate Link layer ports, as addresses are allocated or
          reclaimed.

Automated Binding</h3>

<p>For IPv4 the primary and very widely used automated binding
          technique is DHCP based address assignment.  Controlling where
          authoratitive information can be source, coupled with sniffing 
          and enforcing the assignments is an effective technique.
</p>
<p>For IPv6, there are two common automated address binding
          techniques.  While there are many variations and details, for
          purposes of understanding the threats and basic responses, 
          these are Stateless Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) and DHCPv6
          based address assignment.  In both cases, binding establishment
          needs to be tied to the state machines for these protocols, and
          appropriate message sniffing and enforcement.  For DHCPv6 based
          techniques, it is also necessary to use classification techniques
          to ensure that responses come from authoritative sources.

LAN devices with Multiple Addresses</h3>

<p>From a topology considerations perspective, when attempting
        port-MAC-IP bindings, host connected to switch ports that may have one

Routers</h3>

<p>The most obvious example of devices that are problematic when
          attempting to implement port-MAC-IP bindings is that of routers.
          Routers not only originate packets themselves and often have
          multiple interfaces, but also forward packets from other network
          segments. As a result, it's difficult for port-MAC-IP binding rules
          to be established a priori, because it's likely that many addresses
          and IP subnets should be associated with the port-MAC in
          question.

<p>Validating traffic from Prefix-based and multi-address NATs also 
          becomes problematic, for
          the same reasons as routers. Because they may forward traffic from
          an array of address, a priori knowledge must exist providing what
          IPs should be associated with a given port-MAC pair.

Multi-Instance hosts</h3>

<p>Another example that introduces complexities is that of
          multi-instance hosts attached to a switch port. These are single
          physical devices, which internally run multiple physical or logical
          hosts.  When the device is a blade server, with internal blades each
          hosting a machine, there is essentially a physical switch inside
          the blade server.  While tractable, this creates some complexity
          for determining where enforcement logic can or should live.
</p>
<p>Logically distinct hosts such as are provided by many varieties of
          virtualization logic result in a single physical host, connect to
          a single port on the ethernet switch in the topology, actually having
          multiple internal IP and MAC addresses, and essentially an internal
          switch.  While it may be possible for this internal switch to help 
          control threats among the virtual hosts, or between virtual hosts 
          and other parts of the network, such enforcement can not be counted
          on at this time.

Multi-LAN Hosts</h3>

<p>Multi-interface hosts, in particular those that are multi-homed
          and may forward packets from any of a number of source addresses,
          can be problematic as well. In particular, if a port-MAC-IP binding
          is made on each of the interfaces, and then either a loopback IP or
          the address of third interface is used as the source address of a
          packet and forward through in interface for which the port-MAC-IP
          binding doesn't map, the traffic may be discarded. Static
          configuration of port-MAC-IP bindings may accommodate this scenario,
          although some a priori knowledge on address assignment and topology
          is required.
</p>
<p>While the use of loopback addresssing or sending packets out one
          interface with the source address from another are rare, they do 
          legitimately occur.  Some servers, particularly ones that have underlying
          virtualization, use loopback techniques for management.

Mobile IP</h3>

          properly assigned address that is on the link they are using. And
          their packets are sent and received using that address. (There was
          at one time consideration of allowing mobile hosts to use their home
          address when away from home. This was not done, precisely to ensure
          that mobile hosts comply with source address validity requirements.)
          Mobile Hosts with multiple physical interfaces fall into the cases

<p>Mobile IP home agents are somewhat more interesting. Although
          they are (typically) fixed devices, they are required to send and

IPv6 Considerations</h3>

<p>IPv6 introduces additional capabilities which indirectly complicate
        the spoofing analysis. IPv6 introduces and recommends the use of
        stateless address autoconfiguration (often referred to as SLAAC). This
        allows hosts to determine their IP prefix, select an ID, and then
        start communicating. While there are many advantages to this, the
        absence of control interactions complicates the process of behavioral
        enforcement.
</p>
<p>An additional complication is the very large ID space. Again, this
        64 bit ID space provided by IPv6 has many advantages. It provides the
        opportunity for many useful behaviors. However, it also means that in
        the absence of controls, hosts can mint anonymous addresses as often
        as they like, modulo the idosyncrasies of the duplicate address
        procedure. Like many behaviors, this is a feature for some purposes,
        and a problem for others. But it does have implications for switch
        cost; the switch needs to store more addresses and so needs more
        memory.

Applicability of Anti-Spoofing Solutions</h3>

<p>The above sections covered a number of security threats. Not all
      these threats can be prevented by anti-spoofing techniques. However, all
      of these threats can be ameliorated to some degree. We can look at three
      categories of effect we can achieve:</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Prevention:</dt>
<dd>Some of the threats described above
          explicitly require that a host send packets using some other active
          hosts IP address as a source. Anti-Spoofing measures can prevent
          these attacks.
</dd>
<dt>Impediment:</dt>
<dd>Many of the attacks above, such as some
          kinds of DoS attacks, can be conducted more easily if the attacking
          host can use multiple different IP addresses. Depending upon the
          kind of anti-spoofing available, the scope of such false addresses,
          or even their use, may be prevented, hindering the attacker even if
          the attack is not completely prevented.
</dd>
<dt>Traceability:</dt>
<dd>Even when attacks can not be prevented,
          the ability to reliably trace an attack allows appropriate
          responses, and thereby also creates an environment which discourages
          attacks instead of encouraging them. Thus, ensuring that even
          attacks which are not dependent upon spoofing can not use source
          address spoofing to hide their origin is extremely important.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>For example, sites which deploy BCP 38 can not be the source of
      attacks which rely on spoofing the source site from which an attack was
      launched. Wide deployment of BCP 38 would also simplify the task of
      tracking attacks back to their actual origin.

Analysis of Host Granularity Anti-Spoofing</h3>

<p>Applying anti-spoofing techniques at the host level enables a site
        to achieve several valuable objectives. While it is likely the case
        that for many site topologies and policies, full source spoofing
        protection is not possible, it is also true that for many sites there
        are steps that can be taken that provide benefit.
</p>
<p>One important class of benefit is masquerade prevention. Security
        threats involving one machine masquerading as another, for example in
        order to hijack an apparently secure session, can occur within a site
        with significant impact. Having mechanisms such that host facing
        devices prevent this is a significant intra-site security improvement.
        Given that security experts report that most security breaches are
        internal, this can be valuable. One example of this is that such
        techniques should mitigate internal attacks on the site routing
        system.
</p>
<p>A second class of benefit is related to the traceability described
        above. When a security incident is detect, either within a site, or
        externally (and traced to the site, it can be critical to determine
        what the actual source of the incident was. If address usage can be
        tied to the kinds of anchors described earlier, then it is possible to
        respond to security incidents.
</p>
<p>In addition to these local observable benefits, there can be more
        global benefits. For example, if address usage is tied to anchors, it
        may be possible to prevent or control the use of large numbers of
        anonymous IPv6 addresses for attacks, or at least to track even those
        attacks back to their source.

Existing Techniques for IP Source Address Validation</h3>

<p>Existing techniques for IP source address validation are
      insufficient. While each technique has its own shortcomings, the
      following list of general categories of reasons include some of the
      deficiencies of all existing technique: </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>False negatives:</dt>
<dd>Techniques may yield false negatives,
          thus enabling an attacker to select an IP source address that is
          spoofed, but still passes IP source address validation.
</dd>
<dt>False positives:</dt>
<dd>Techniques may yield false positives,
          thereby causing interruption or denial of service to hosts that use
          legitimate IP source addresses.
</dd>
<dt>Non-trivial configuration:</dt>
<dd>Requirements for
          non-trivial configuration imply expenditures and pose a risk for
          misconfiguration, which may again lead to false positives or false
          negatives. Both may discourage operators from employing a given
          technique.
</dd>
<dt>Proprietary:</dt>
<dd>Procurement policies oftentimes require
          techniques that are standardized, hence hindering or preventing the
          deployment of proprietary techniques.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>The only standardized technique for IP source address validation is
      ingress filtering <a class='info' href='#RFC2827'>[RFC2827]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ferguson, P. and D. Senie, &ldquo;Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks which employ IP Source Address Spoofing,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>. This calls for routers
      to check whether the prefix of a to-be-forwarded packet's IP source
      address is amongst a list of prefixes considered legitimate for the
      interface through which the packet arrives. Packets that fail this check
      are discarded.
</p>
<p>Ingress filtering may yield false negatives in a deterministic
      manner. Packets with a legitimate IP source address prefix, but a
      spoofed interface identifier, pass ingress filtering checks. Also,
      packets with an illegitimate IP source address prefix pass the checks as
      long as the prefix is from the list of prefixes considered legitimate,
      if more than one prefix is considered as legitimate on the ingress
      interface..
</p>
<p>Ingress filtering implementations that require manual establishment
      of the list of legitimate prefixes cause considerable configuration
      overhead. Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) mitigates this issue by
      automatically deriving the list of legitimate prefixes from a router's
      forwarding table: A to-be-forwarded packet's IP source address prefix is
      considered legitimate if the packet is coming through an interface via
      which return traffic would be routed. On the other hand, Unicast Reverse
      Path Forwarding may yield false positives, in particular for hosts and
      networks with multiple, topologically separate Internet attachments
      <a class='info' href='#RFC3704'>[RFC3704]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baker, F. and P. Savola, &ldquo;Ingress Filtering for Multihomed Networks,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Consequently, there is a need for an IP source address validation
      technique that avoids false negatives and false positives, that can be
      set up with no or only trivial configuration, and that has been
      standardized. The development of such a technique is the goal of the
      proposed Source Address Validation Improvements (SAVI) working group in
      the Internet Engineering Task Force.

Deployment Considerations</h3>

<p>From a global Internet perspective, deployment of anti- spoofing
      techniques tends to suffer from a "tragedy of the commons" situation.
      That is, there is a general consensus that everyone should implement
      anti-spoofing measures, yet individual organizations don't want to bear
      the cost of deployment themselves, often because demonstrating direct
      tangible return on investment is not possible. Upon analysis, it often
      seems apparent that local implementation of anti-spoofing measures is of
      more benefit to the "greater Internet" than the local network domain
      itself. A similar situation occurs with de-aggregation of Internet
      routing information for multi-homing and traffic engineering purposes,
      as well as the lack of explicit inter-domain routing prefix filters on
      the Internet.

      choices have global implications, and act upon this responsibility, the
      problem is not going to go away.
</p>
<p>Ideally, with additional work in the areas of SAVI to ease deployment
      and management burdens, the deployment cost to operators will decrease
      and more wide-scale deployment will continue. Furthermore, application
      of SAVI-like techniques provides more obvious benefits to network
      administrators that are concerned with MITM and similar attacks.
</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, there are local security benefits to the
      deployment of SAVI security mechanisms. This may help motivate the
      deployment of tools with widespread benefit.

IANA Considerations</h3>

<p>This memo asks the IANA for no new parameters.
</p>
<p>Note to RFC Editor: This section will have served its purpose if it
      correctly tells IANA that no new assignments or registries are required,
      or if those assignments or registries are created during the RFC
      publication process. From the author"s perspective, it may therefore be
      removed upon publication as an RFC at the RFC Editor"s discretion.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>This document provides limited discussion of some security threats
      source address validation improvements will help to mitigate. It is not
      meant to be all-inclusive, either from a threat analysis perspective, or
      from the source address verification application side.
</p>
<p>It is seductive to think of SAVI solutions as providing the ability
      to use this technology to trace a datagram to the person, or at least
      end system, that originated it. For several reasons, the technology can
      be used to derive circumstantial evidence, but does not actually solve
      that problem.
</p>
<p>In the Internet Layer, the source address of a datagram should be the
      address of the system that originated it and to which any reply is
      expected to come. But systems fall into several broad categories. Many
      are single user systems, such as laptops and PDAs. Multi-user systems
      are commonly used in industry, and a wide variety of middleware systems
      and application servers have no user at all, but by design relay
      messages or perform services on behalf of users of other systems (e.g.,
      SMTP and peer-to-peer file sharing).
</p>
<p>Until every Internet-connected network implements source address
      validation at the ultimate network ingress, and assurances exist that
      intermediate devices are to never modify datagram source addresses,
      source addresses must not be used as an authentication mechanism. The
      only technique to unquestionably verify source addresses of a received
      datagram are cryptographic authentication mechanisms such as IPSEC.
