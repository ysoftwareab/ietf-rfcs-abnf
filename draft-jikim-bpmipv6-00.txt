    Abstract

       This document proposes an enhanced handover scheme on the Proxy
       Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) with bicasting for IP handover (B-PMIPv6). In B-
       PMIPv6, a mobile node (MN) performs binding update to Local Mobility
       Anchor (LMA) in advance, and then the LMA begins the bicasting of
       data packets to the new Mobile Access Gateway (N-MAG) as well as the
       previous MAG (P-MAG). The B-PMIPv6 minimizes the possible packet
       losses and handover latency during handover.

    Internet-Draft                       PMIPv6 with Bicasting for IP Handover  September 2009


       1. Introduction

       The Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) can be used to support the IP handover in
       Mobile networks [1]. However, there are still a lot of challenging
       issues to be addressed in the MIPv6. One of them is how to reduce the
       modification of mobile node (MN). For example, to perform the
       mobility management signaling, each MN should be equipped with the
       MIPv6 functionality. Such a protocol is referred to 'host-based
       mobility management' protocol.

       In the wireless network environment, however, it is not effective
       that each MN performs the MIPv6 because of the short of resource in
       wireless network such as link bandwidth or MM power. Above all, it is
       not easy for MN to implement any mobility software such as MIPv6.

       Recently, the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) protocol provides the
       network-based IP mobility management protocol. In PMIPv6, the mobile
       agent located in the network will perform the mobility signaling
       instead of MN and will keep track of the movement of MN.

       It is noted that PMIPv6 is used mainly for binding update of the
       location of MNs. A recent work has been made on the PMIPv6 handover.
       However, there are still lots of issues that need to be solved in the
       perspective of seamless handover.

       This document describes a new handover scheme of PMIPv6 with
       bicasting for seamless IP handover, in which the PMIPv6 Local
       Mobility Agent (LMA) will bicast the data packets to the Previous-
       Mobile Access Gateway (P-MAG) and New-Mobile Access Gateway (N-MAG)
       toward MN, when MN is in the handover region.

       2. Conventions used in this document

       In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
       server respectively.

       The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
       "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
       document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].

       3. Protocol Detail

       This document extends the PMIPv6 handover scheme, which can be used
       to reduce the packet loss and handover latency during handover using
       bicasting in the PMIPv6 network.

                           Figure 1 Network Architecture

       The reference network configuration for B-PMIPv6 domain is shown in
       Figure 1. MN moves from P-MAG region to N-MAG region. This document
       supposes that there is overlapping region between MAGs. When MN is in
       the overlapping region, and then the LMA begins the bicasting of data
       packets to the N-MAG as well as P-MAG. This bicasting is performed to
       minimize the possibility of packet losses and handover latency during
       handover, because it is possible that the MN receives the data packet
       from whether P-MAG or N-MAG.

    Internet-Draft                       PMIPv6 with Bicasting for IP Handover  September 2009


       The operation of the B-PMIPv6 is shown as figure 2. First, when MN
       moves to the bicasting region, it detects that a handover is imminent
       and reports the identifications of itself (MN-ID) and the access
       point (New AP ID) to which the MN is most likely to move. The MN ID
       could be the NAI or a Link Layer Address (LLA), or any other suitable
       identifier. This step is access technology specific, In some cases,
       the Previous-Access Network (P-AN) will determine which AP ID the MN
       is moving to. The P-AN, to which the MN is currently attached
       indicates the handover of the MN to the P-MAG. Detailed definition
       and specification of this message are outside the scope of this
       document.

       After P-MAG receives an HO Initiate, the P-MAG sends Handover
       Initiate (HI) message to N-MAG where the HI message includes MN's IP
       address that are both Proxy-CoA (P-CoA) and Home address (MN-HoA),
       LMA address (LMAA) and MN's Identifier. The N-MAG receives HI message,
       it should examine whether a tunnel to the LMA exists or not. If the
       tunnel has not been established, it should establish the tunnel from
       LMA.

       To establish the tunnel, the N-MAG sends a PBU (Bicasting Init)
       message to the LMA. It includes MN-Identifier and MN-HoA.

       When the LMA receives the PBU (Bicasting Init) message, it creates a
       new binding entry. If the LMA successfully processes the PBU
       (Bicasting Init), it sets the tunnel with N-MAG for sending and
       receiving data packets. After successful establishment of the tunnel,
       the LMA sends a PBA (Bicasting Ack) message, it examines whether or
       not the PBU (Bicasting Init) message was processed successfully. If
       there is a failure, the PBA (Bicasting Ack) message indicates the
       failure. On the other hand, N-MAG creates a tunnel to the LMA and
       ensures that the packets with destination address as P-CoA are copied
       and forwarded over the tunnel. It also creates a host route for
       forwarding packets to the MN. The N-MAG sends a Handover Ack message
       back to the P-MAG to indicate whether handover procedure was
       successfully done or not.

       When the MN connects to the new link, the MN establishes a physical
       link connection with the New Access Network (N-AN), for example,
       radio channel assignment, which is turn triggers the establishment of
       a link-layer connection between the N-AN and N-MAG if not yet
       established. An IP layer connection setup may be performed at this
       time (e.g., PPP IPv6CP) or at a later time (e.g., stateful or
       stateless auto address configuration). This step can be a substitute
       for the UNA in [4], but since they are all access technology specific,
       details are outside the scope of this document. And then the N-MAG
       sends a PBU (Bicasting Completion) message to the LMA. This message

    Internet-Draft                       PMIPv6 with Bicasting for IP Handover  September 2009


       includes MN-Identifier and P-CoA of N-MAG. On reception of this BC
       message, the LMA deletes the binding cache entry associated with the
       P-MAG, and stop the bicasting (i.e., release the tunnel between LMA
       and P-MAG). In response to PBU (Bicasting Completion) message, the
       LMA sends PBA (Bicasting Completion Ack) message to the N-MAG. By
       thus, the bicasting operations are completed.

       4. Handover process

       MAG is responsible for detecting the mobile node's movements to and
       from the access link and for initiating binding registrations to the
       mobile node's LMA.

       with bicasting, in which binding update is performed in advance and
       then perform the bicasting of data packets to the N-MAG as well as P-
       MAG. From the performance analytical results, we can see that the
       proposed scheme reduces the packet losses and handover latency when
       it is compared with the two existing PMIPv6 handover schemes by
       performing bicasting data packets from LMA to MN during handover.
