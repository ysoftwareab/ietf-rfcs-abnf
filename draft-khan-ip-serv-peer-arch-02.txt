1. Introduction 

   The objective of this document is to define a reference peering 
   architecture in the context of SPEERMINT. In this process, we define 
   a peering reference architecture, its functional components, and 
   peering interface functions from the perspective of a real-time 
   application (Voice and Multimedia) IP Service provider network.  

   This reference architecture applies mainly to SIP-based voice and 
   multimedia traffic only and has not considered traditional Internet 
   traffic such as HTTP.

   IP Layer peering includes the implementation of Dual Network Address 
   Translation (NAT), IPv4 and IPv6 mapping, IPv6 aggregation, L3 rate 
   shaping, bandwidth theft protection, VPN mediation, and L3 DoS/DDoS 
   protection in addition to the implementation of BGP.  The 
   implementation of many of these functions is OPTIONAL. 

   IP Layer peering is outside the scope of SPEERMINT at this time; 
   thus, we do not include them in the SPEEMINT Peering Architecture. 
   Note that IP Routers are not shown in the subsequent figures so that 
   the focus is on Layer 5 protocol aspects.  

2. Network Context 

   Figure 1 shows an example network context. Two or more providers on 
   either the public Internet or private L3 networks may form a SIP (L5) 
   federation.  The public or private peering location server function 
   enables discovery of federations and all provider peering points.  
   Subsequent exchanges with those provider peering points will enable 
   discover of policy and additional signaling and media peering points.

   Federation Entity 

   We define federation as a providers' group that has contractual 
   agreements on various aspects of peering relationship such as common 
   administrative policy, settlement, and terminating calls. The members 
   of a federation may jointly own or use a set of entities such as 
   application servers, subscriber databases, SIP proxies, ENUM servers, 
   DNS servers, and platforms that synthesize various SIP and non-SIP 
   based applications. 

   The following figure shows an example of a federated entity in a star 
   topology.

   Within the L5 Service Provider's network there may be IP phones, 
   Proxies, B2BUA, IVR, and other hosts that originate or terminate L5 
   signaling and L5 media paths.  The L5 SP may also operate 
   interworking Gateways to the PTSN and Wireless networks.  These 
   internal elements and external elements are beyond the scope of the 
   L5 Peering point. 

   A real-time application (Voice and Multimedia) IP Service provider 
   network contains functions of SIP/SIPPING/SIMPLE related RFCs in 
   general and RFC3261 [2] in particular.  Examples of these functions 
   are SIP Proxies, SIP UAs, and B2BUAs.  In addition, these IP Service 
   providers' networks contain IP Routers, Application servers, and 
   databases.  The network may also contain private ENUM and DNS. 

   A real-time application (Voice and Multimedia) IP Service provider 
   interconnects with other real-time application (Voice and Multimedia) 
   IP Service providers through a set of peering interface functions 
   which are discussed next. 

4. Peering Interface Functions 

   An IP Service peering interface can be divided into various planes.  
   This document proposes the following decomposition of functions: 

   o  Location Function (LF):  Purpose is to enable discovery of the OF 
      peering point.  
 
 
khan                  Expires November 15, 2006                [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft     draft-khan-ip-serv-peer-arch-02             May 2006 
    

   o  Operation Function (OF):  Purpose is to enable discovery and 
      exchange of policy and parameters to be used in with the SF 
      peering point. 

   o  Signaling Function (SF):  Purpose is to enable the discovery of 
      endpoints and assist in discovery and exchange of parameters to be 
      used with the MF peering point. 

   o  Media Function (MF):  Purpose is to enable the interconnection of 
      media paths between endpoints.  

   o  QoS Function (QF):  Purpose is to negotiate and reserve bandwidth 
      resources, as well as police and provide measurements for media 
      paths. 

   o  Application Function (AF):  TBD 

   Note that each of these functions must address security 
   considerations.                 

4.1. Location Function (LF) 

   The PF provides a mutual location servicing capability between two 
   peers or among peers in a federation. The main function of the LF is 
   to provide a trusted registry database. Possible examples of a PF are 
   mutually trusted DNS and ENUM in a federation. Another example of LF 
   is number portability. In a federation, LF is a function of a 
   federated entity. 

4.2. Operation Function (OF) 

   O&M Function (OF) include: 

   o  Operational data mediation:  TBD 

   o  CALEA implementation:  TBD 

   o  Accounting:  Call Detail Record's (CDR's) MAY be collected to be 
      utilized by the peering operators.  Based on the application, the 
      format should be an open standard for common consumption of 
      billing systems.  Operators may use this data for a number of 
      reasons, including billing in the event the peering relationship 
      becomes asymmetric (unbalanced traffic flow) or there is a Tier 1 
      to Tier 2 relationship.  In order to limit the potential for 
      billing systems to impact the OF, a separate server should be 
      created to maintain all records collected from a single 
      interconnection to any number of OF's. 
 
 
khan                  Expires November 15, 2006                [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft     draft-khan-ip-serv-peer-arch-02             May 2006 
    

   An OF can also be a special function that contains bi-laterally 
   disclosed information about the application servers and databases of 
   each IP service provider. An example of this function is to allow a 
   session to select a better suited application server from a set of 
   application servers located inside both service providers' network.  

4.3. Signaling Function (SF) 

   The SF performs Layer 5 peering functions i.e., SIP signaling and 
   control functions at the interconnect interface.  Examples of SF from 
   SIP RFCs are SIP Proxy and SIP B2BUA. Tasks that the SF must perform 
   are: 

   Session Admission Control (SAC): This is an optional feature. A 
   provider may or may not implement SAC. Define SAC: TBD  

   Note, in case a session is rejected because of the SAC 
   implementation, the session rejecting provider Y needs to inform the 
   originating provider X, the cause of rejection with appropriate SIP 
   error message. The SPEERMINT routing architecture message flow 
   document will describe these messages. 

   SIP Interoperability: TBD  

   SIP Denial of Service (DoS) protection: Providers will most likely 
   implement DoS protection mechanism. Define DoS: TBD   

   Note, in case sessions are rejected due to the DoS protection 
   implementation, the session rejecting provider Y needs to inform the 
   originating provider X, the cause of rejection with appropriate SIP 
   error messages. The SPEERMINT routing architecture message flow 
   document will describe these messages. 

   SIP Topology Hiding (THIG): This optional feature will hide internal 
   layer 5 architecture of a service provider and its end users. 

   SIP security, privacy and encryption: The SF may support Security 
   functions to provide authentication, privacy (encryption) and message 
   integrity functions. These functions may be provided by using IPSec 
   or TLS.

4.4. Media Function (MF) 

   Media is composed of encoded Voice or Video carried in RTP streams 
   carried within Layer 3 IP streams.  The MF may transform voice 
   payload from one coding (e.g., G.711) to another (e.g., EvRC). Other 
   Media Functions (MF) include media security, privacy and encryption.   

4.5. QoS Function (QF) 

   The QF typically would be at the IP border between service providers 
   and ensure that incoming and outgoing packets are QOS-marked 
   correctly according to federation or peer policy.  Its implementation 
   is OPTIONAL unless government regulations mandate required 
   implementation.   

   Separate IETF documents address SIP priority and QoS issues.  It is 
   desirable that the various standards bodies (e.g., IETF, ITU, and 
   3GPP) converge on a compatible set of SIP priority header mappings 
   particularly with special attention to the emergency services 
   (ETS/WPS). 

4.6. Application Function (AF) 

   TBD 

5. Call Control and Media Control Deployment Options 

   The peering functions can either be deployed along the following two 
   dimensions depending upon how the SF and the MF along with IP 
   functions are implemented: 

   Composed or Decomposed:  Addresses the question whether the media 
   paths must flow through the same physical and geographic nodes as the 
   call signaling, 

   Centralized or Distributed:  Addresses the question whether the 
   logical and physical peering points are in one geographical location 
   or distributed to multiple physical locations on the service provider 
   network. 

   In a composed model, SF, and MF functions are implemented in one 
   entity.

   The advantage of composed peering architecture is that one-device 
   solves all peering issues. Disadvantage examples of this architecture 
   are single point failure, bottle neck, and complex scalability. 

   In a decomposed model, SF and MF are implemented in separate 
   entities. Signaling functions are implemented in a proxy and media 
   functions are implemented in another device.  The scaling of 
   signaling versus scaling of media may differ between applications.  
   Decomposing allows each to follow a separate migration path. 

   This model allows the implementation of M:N model where one SF is 
   associated with multiple peering routers and one peering router is 
   associated with multiple peering proxies. Generally, a vertical 
   protocol such as MGCP associates the relationship between a peering 
   proxy and a peering router. This architecture reduces the potential 
   of single point failure. This architecture, allows separation of the 
   policy decision point and the policy enforcement point. An example of 
   disadvantages is the scaling complexity because of the M:N 
   relationship and latency due to the vertical control messages between 
   entities.  

6. Security Considerations 

   In all cases, cryptographic-based security should be maintained as an 
   optional requirement between peering providers conditioned on the

   presence or absence of underlying physical security of peer 
   connections, e.g. within the same secure physical building.   

   In order to maintain a consistent approach, unique and specialized 
   security requirements common for the majority of peering 
   relationships, should be standardized within the IETF.  These 
   standardized methods may enable capabilities such as dynamic peering 
   relationships across publicly maintained interconnections. 

   TODO:  Address RFC-3552 BCP items.   

7. IANA Considerations 

   There are no IANA considerations at this time. 

8. Conclusions 

   The proposed peering reference architecture decomposes the peering 
   interface into a set of well defined functions.  Such an arrangement 
   allows each function to the specified and evolved separately.
