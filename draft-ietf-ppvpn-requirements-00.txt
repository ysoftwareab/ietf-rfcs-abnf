   This document provides requirements for Provider Provisioned Virtual 
   Private Networks (PPVPNs). It identifes requirements applicable to a 
   number of individual approaches that a Service Provider may use for 
   the provisioning of a VPN service. This document expresses a service 
   provider perspective, based upon past experience of IP-based service 
   offerings and the ever evolving needs of the customers of such 
   services. Toward this end, it first defines terminology and states 
   general requirements. Detailed requirements are expressed from a 
   customer as well as a service provider perspective.

1 Introduction 
   NOTE: EDITOR"S NOTES, ISSUES AND AREAS REQUIRING FURTHER WORK ARE 
   INDICATED IN ALL CAPS. 
    
1.1 Scope of this document 
   This document provides requirements for Provider Provisioned Virtual 
   Private Networks (ppvpn). It identifies requirements that may apply 
   to one or more individual approaches that a Service Provider may use 
   for the provisioning of a VPN service. The document states 
   requirements from a general point of view, as well as from a customer 
   and service provider point of view. The content of this document 
   makes use of the terminologies and common components for deploying 
   PPVPNs defined in [PPVPN-FR]. 
    
   The specification of any technical means to provide PPVPN services is 
   outside the scope of this document. Other documents, such as the 
   framework document [PPVPN-FR] and several sets of documents, one set 
   per each individual technical approach providing PPVPN services, are 
   intended to cover this aspect. 
    
   The charter of the PPVPN working group defines at least three types 
   of PPVPNs: BGP-VPNs (e.g. RFC 2547), virtual routers and port-based 
   VPNs (i.e., where the SP provides a Layer 2 interface, such as Frame 
   Relay or ATM, to the VPN customer, while using IP-based mechanisms in 
   the provider infrastructure to improve scalability and 
   configurability over traditional L2 networks). The approach followed 
   in this document distinguishes PPVPN types as to where the endpoints 
   of tunnels exist and whether the service provided is layer 2 or layer 
   3. Terminology regarding whether equipment faces a customer or the 
   service provider network is used to define the various types of PPVPN 
   solutions. This requirements document summarizes the reference model 
   from framework document [PPVPN-FR]for the convenience of readers. 
    
   This document does not map requirements to each individual approach. 
   Rather, it"s intended use is as a "checklist" of requirements that 
   will provide a consistent way to evaluate and document how well each 
   individual approach satisfies a specific requirement. The relevant 
   documents for each individual approach should document the results of 
   this evaluation. 
    
   This document first provides general requirements, followed by 
   requirements from a customer perspective, and concludes with 
   requirements from a Service Provider (SP) perspective. These 
   requirements provide high level PPVPN features expected by a SP in 
   provisioning PPVPN to make them beneficial to his customers. These 
   general requirements include SP requirements for security, privacy, 
   manageability, interoperability and scalability, including SP" s 
   projections for number, complexity, and rate of change of customer 
   VPNs over the next several years.

1.2 Outline 
   The outline of the rest of this document is as follows. Section 2 
   defines terminology and summarizes the ppvpn reference model. Section 
   3 provides general requirements. Section 4 states requirements from a 
   customer perspective. Section 5 states requirements from a service 
   provider perspective. Section 6 describes security considerations. 
   Section 7 lists acknowledgements. Section 8 provides a list of 
   references cited herein. Section 9 lists the author"s addresses. 
    
2 Definitions 
   NOTE: DEFINITIONS IN THIS SECTION WERE TAKEN FROM PREVIOUS TEXT, THE 
   FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT AND THE NOTES CAPTURED BY THE DESIGN TEAM. 
    
2.1 Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Network 
   This document uses the word "private" in VPN in the sense of 
   ownership, which is different from the use of the similar word 
   "privacy" used in discussions regarding security. The term "virtual 
   private" means that the offered service retains at least some aspects 
   of a privately owned customer network. 
    
   The term "Virtual Private Network" (VPN) refers to the 
   interconnection of customer sites, making use of a shared network 
   infrastructure. Multiple sites of a private network may therefore be 
   interconnected via the public infrastructure, in order to facilitate 
   the operation of the private network. The logical structure of the 
   VPN, such as addressing, reachability, and access control, is 
   equivalent to part of or all of a conventional private network using 
   private facilities.  
    
   The term "Provider Provisioned VPN" refers to VPNs for which the 
   service provider participates in management and provisioning of the 
   VPN. 
    
   The taxonomy of PPVPN types has two principal dimensions: whether the 
   service provided to the customer is layer 2 or layer 3, and whether 
   the tunnels that provide the service either terminate on Customer 
   facing Equipment (CE), or on "Network-based" Provider Edge (PE) 
   equipment. Note that the definitions of Customer Equipment and 
   Provider Edge do not necessarily map to the physical deployment of 
   equipment on customer premises or a provider point of presence.  
    
2.2 Customers, Sites, Users, and Subscribers 
   THE FOLLOWING ARE TENTATIVE DEFINITIONS TAKEN FROM [VPN-
   NEEDS](ALIGNMENT OF THE DOCUMENT TO THESE TENTATIVE DEFINITIONS HAS 
   NOT BEEN RIGOROUSLY PURSUED)  
   Customer = subscriber. 
   Subscriber : A subscriber (or a customer) is a legal representative 
   who has the (legal) ability to subscribe to a service offering. 
   User : A user is an entity (a human being or a process, from a 
   general perspective) who has been named by a subscriber and

                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   appropriately identified by a service provider, so that he might 
   benefit from a service according to his associated rights and duties. 
    
   The definition of site is taken from [RFC 2547], as follows: 
   From the perspective of a particular backbone network, a set of IP 
   systems constitutes a site if those systems have mutual IP 
   interconnectivity, and communication between them occurs without use 
   of the backbone. In general, a site will consist of a set of systems 
   which are in geographic proximity.  However, this is not universally 
   true; two geographic locations connected via a leased line, over 
   which OSPF is running, will constitute a single site, because 
   communication between the two locations does not involve the use of 
   the backbone. 
    
2.3 Intranets and Extranets 
   An intranet defines connectivity between sites in the same 
   organization. This is the simplest and most common scenario. In this 
   scenario, a VPN is formed between different sites belonging to the 
   same organization. For example, this scenario could be envisioned as 
   one where different branch offices are interconnected and/or also 
   connect to the headquarters. This is the minimum/mandatory scenario 
   that needs to be supported by any VPN architecture. All other service 
   deployment scenarios require certain modifications/extensions to the 
   basic intranet architecture.  
    
   An extranet defines connectivity between sites across multiple 
   organizations. In an extranet scenario, two or more organizations 
   have access to a limited number of each other"s sites.  Examples of 
   an extranet scenario include multiple companies cooperating in joint 
   software development, a service provider having access to information 
   from the vendors" corporate sites, different companies and 
   universities participating in a consortium, etc.  An extranet can 
   exist across a single service provider backbone or across multiple 
   backbones or autonomous systems. The main difference between an 
   extranet and an intranet is the existence of some kind of an access 
   control mechanism at the interconnection between different 
   organizations. This access control can be implemented by a firewall, 
   access lists on routers or similar mechanisms to apply policy-based 
   access control to transit traffic. The access control mechanism may 
   be achieved using separate devices or may be integrated into the PE 
   device. 
    
2.4 Layered VPN Services 
   A PPVPN must provide a layer 2 VPN service, a layer 3 VPN service, or 
   both to a set of customer sites.  
 
2.5 Layer 2 VPN Service 
   In a layer 2 VPN service, a customer site receives datalink layer 
   (i.e., layer 2) service from the SP. The CE and PE are adjacent to 
   each other at the datalink layer and not at the IP layer. A PE 
   performs forwarding of customer data packets based on information in 
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                 7 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   the packets" datalink layer headers, such as a frame relay DLCI or 
   802.1q VLAN tag. That is, the CE sees the PE as a layer 2 device such 
   as a FR switch or an Ethernet VLAN switch. 
    
   Initial protocol proposals have been made to define how an IP-
   controlled MPLS network could provide a layer 2 VPN service. See [L2 
   VPN] and [L2 MPLS] for more information. 
 
2.6 Layer 3 VPN Service 
   In a layer 3 VPN service, a customer site receives IP layer (i.e., 
   layer 3) service from the SP. The CE and PE are adjacent to each 
   other at the datalink layer and the IP layer. The PE performs 
   forwarding of customer data packets based on information in the IP 
   layer header, such as an IPv4 or IPv6 destination address. The CE 
   sees the PE as a layer 3 device such as an IPv4 or IPv6 router. 
    
2.7 Customer Equipment (CE) Based 
   In a CE-based VPN, the tunnels terminate at the CE, as detailed in 
   the reference model described below. The CE faces the network at 
   customer site, but may or may not be located on the customer 
   premises. The PE may optionally distinguish between packets that 
   belong to the PPVPN based upon the VPN tunnel, and not based on the 
   user data packet header. The provider may or may not manage the 
   customer equipment.  
    
   Examples of a CE-based layer 3 VPN service are a SP managed IPsec 
   router, or a customer-managed router tunneled over an ISP network.  
    
   Examples of a CE-based layer 2 VPN service are a managed router 
   connected, or a customer-managed router connected via layer 2 
   connections. 
    
   The above CE-based "customer-managed router" scenarios are outside of 
   the PPVPN WG charter. 
    
2.7.1  Reference Model 
   Figure 2.1 shows the reference model for SP managed CE-based VPN. The 
   entities in the reference model are described below. 
    
   NOTE: MANY OF THESE TERMS AND DEFINITIONS OVERLAP WITH THE NEXT 
   SECTION ON NETWORK-BASED VPNS.  
    
   o Customer edge (CE) device: This device is provisioned and possibly 
   managed as well by the service provider. For example, it may support 
   IPsec. 
    
   o Provider edge (PE) router: It is a router without any VPN specific 
   functionality. 
    
   o SP networks: IP network + CE management function.

2.8 Network Based 
   In a Network-based VPN, the tunnels terminate at the PE, as detailed 
   in the reference model described below. The PE faces the service 
   provider network, but may or may not be located in a service provider 
   point of presence. The PE distinguishes between packets that belong 
   to the PPVPN based on information in the user data packet at L1, L2, 
   and/or L3. The service provider always manages the PE equipment. 
    
   The term "Network-Based VPN" is also defined by the ITU-T in 
   Y.1311.1, as follows. "A network-based IP VPN provides a layer-3 
   service to customers. A customer site may be connected  to the 
   Service Provider network-based IP VPN, and the IP VPN takes care of 
   routing packets to the correct customer destination. With a network-
   based IP VPN the Provider edge routers are responsible for learning

   and distributing among themselves the customer layer-3 reachability 
   information."  
    
   An example of a Network-based layer 2 VPN is provision of a FR or ATM 
   service over an MPLS-based, IP controlled service provider backbone 
   [L2 VPN], [L2 MPLS].  
    
   Examples of a Network-based layer 3 VPN are the BGP/MPLS VPN [RFC 
   2547] or virtual routers [2917bis], [VPN-VR].  
    
2.8.1  Reference Model 
   Figure 2.2 shows the reference model for network-based VPN and Figure 
   2.3 shows relationship between entities in the reference model. The 
   entities in the reference model are described below. 
 
  ?     Customer edge (CE) device: A CE device is a device on the customer 
     site which has an access connection to a PE router. It may be a 
     router, host, or switch located at the edge of a user site.  
 
  ?     P Router: A router within a provider network which is used to 
     interconnect PE routers, but which does not have any VPN state and 
     does not have any direct attachment to CE devices.  
 
  ?     Provider Edge (PE) router: A PE router is attached via an access 
     connection to one or more CE devices. In the context of supporting 
     VPNs, a PE router implements one or more VFIs and maintains per-VPN 
     state. (Note that access connections are terminated by VFIs from 
     the functional point of view.) 
    
  ?     SP networks: An SP network is a network administered by a single 
     service provider.  
 
  ?     Access connection: An access connection represents an isolated L2 
     connectivity between a CE device and a PE router. This includes 
     dedicated physical circuits, logical circuits (such as Frame Relay 
     and ATM), plus IP tunnels (eg, using IPsec, L2TP).  
 
  ?     Access network: An access network provides access connections 
     between CE devices and PE routers.  It may be a TDM network, L2 
     network (e.g. FR, ATM, and Ethernet), or IP network over which 
     access is tunneled (eg using L2TP [RFC2661]).  
 
  ?     VPN Tunnel: A VPN tunnel is a logical link between two entities 
     which is created by encapsulating packets within an encapsulating 
     header for purpose of transmission between those two entities for 
     support of VPNs. 
    
   VFIs are typically interconnected via (per-VPN) tunnels. This is 
   illustrated in figure 2.3. Another example of a tunnel is a 
   connection between PE routers.

   Multiple tunnels at one level may be hierarchically multiplexed into 
   a single tunnel at another level. For example, multiple per-VPN 
   tunnels may be multiplexed into a single PE to PE tunnel.

  ?     VPN Forwarding Instance (VFI): A VFI is a logical entity that 
     resides in a PE, that includes the router information base and 
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                11

     forwarding information base for a VPN.  A VFI enables router 
     functions dedicated to serving a particular VPN.  In general a VFI 
     terminates tunnels for interconnection with other VFIs and also 
     terminates access connections for accommodating CEs. The 
     interaction between routing and VFIs is discussed in section 5.4.  
 
  ?     Customer and Network Management Functions: Customer and network 
     management functions may use a combination of proprietary network 
     management system, SNMP manager, or directory service (eg, LDAP 
     [RFC1777] [RFC2251]).   
    
2.9 VPN Tunnels 
   In a L3 PPVPN, a number of IP tunneling protocols are available, 
   however, in this document, three different tunneling mechanisms; 
   MPLS, GRE, and IPsec are considered to support VPN. In a L2 PPVPN, a 
   number of layer 2 tunnel types are available, the main ones being   
   FR, ATM, MPLS. 
    
   In a network-based PPVPN, a tunnel enables the forwarding of packets 
   between a specified set of CE devices via PEs accommodating them. In 
   a CE-based PPVPN, a tunnel exists between CE devices. Since detailed 
   PPVPN functions depend on the specifics on a tunnel, this section 
   gives an overview of tunneling protocols. 
    
   When MPLS is used for the tunneling mechanism, LSPs implement tunnels 
   and the multiplexing is supported by the two-layer label stacking of 
   the MPLS. In this case, the nested tunnels identified by the bottom 
   label in the stack are multiplexed into a tunnel identified by the 
   top label. This enables high-speed packet forwarding, because the 
   forwarding processing does not refer to the bottom label. 
    
   When GRE is used for the tunneling mechanism and the key field 
   extension is supported, the nested VPN tunnels are identified by the 
   key field. Note that if the key field is not present, there is no 
   means available to nest tunnels. 
    
   When IPsec is used for the tunneling mechanism, they are identified 
   by the SPI field.  
    
   Note that when the tunnel is provided by GRE or IPsec, it may pass 
   through another tunneling mechanism (e.g., an IPsec tunnel over an 
   MPLS network).  
    
3 General Requirements 
    
3.1 Topology 
   The VPN service offering should support arbitrary user defined inter-
   site connectivity, ranging, for example, from hub-and-spoke, partial 
   mesh to full mesh topology. 
    
   An approach should support multiple VPNs per customer site. 
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                12 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
    
   To the extent possible, the PPVPN services should independent of the 
   access network technology. 
    
3.2 Exchange of Data and Routing Information 
   A mechanism for distributing reachability information between only 
   those sites across a PPVPN must be provided. 
    
   A mechanism to exchange reachability information with equipment at 
   customer sites within a PPVPN must be provided. 
    
   A means to constrain the distribution of addressed data to only those 
   sites determined either by routing data and/or configuration must be 
   provided. 
    
3.3 Addressing 
   The VPN service offering should satisfy the following addressing 
   requirements:  
   - support of customer VPN address overlapping - IP addresses have to 
   be unique only within a given VPN, but not across VPNs. As direct 
   consequence, the customer having deployed its own private numbering 
   scheme on every location, this IP numbering scheme must be 
   controlled; 
   - he solution should be  able (easily extendable) to enable a SP 
   having an IPv4 or an IPv6 backbone to provide both IPv4 and IPv6 VPNs 
   to its customers. 
   - minimization of the usage of IP addresses (e.g., for mobile 
   users)should be pursued; 
   - support of NAT capabilities (NEEDS FURTHER DETAIL) 
    
3.4 Security 
   CURRENT STRUCTURE OF 3.4 FOLLOWS THAT IN [VPN-CRIT].  
   ALIGN WITH FRAMEWORK DRAFT AND PLANNED DRAFT ON IPSEC VPNS. 
   THE ADOPTED STRUCTURE SHOULD BE THEN ALSO ALIGNED WITH SECURITY 
   SECTIONS IN CHAPTER 4 AND 5. 
    
3.4.1  User data security   
   PPVPN solutions that support user data security should use standard 
   means to achieve confidentiality, integrity, origin authentication. 
    
3.4.2  Routing data security 
PPVPN solutions shall define means that [VPN-CRIT]: 
- prevent  routers of a VPN from interaction with unauthorized 
  entities,  
- prevent routes to VPN destinations from leaking to undesired 
  entities, 
- avoid introducing undesired routing information to taint the VPN 
   routing information base.. 
    
3.4.3  Access control

3.4.4  VPN isolation 
 
3.4.5 Site authentication and authorization 
 
3.5 Management 
   The management activity of VPN services evolves in the TMN model. 
   Then it will have to comply with the following requirements : 
   - engineer, deploy and manage the switching and transmission 
   resources supporting the service, from a network perspective (network 
   element management); 
   - manage the VPNs deployed over these resources (network management); 
   - manage the VPN service (service management) ;  
   - manage the VPN business, mainly provisioning administrative and 
   accounting information related to the VPN service customers (business 
   management). 
    
   The service management itself should at least include the global 
   activation of the TMN FCAPS functionalities.  
   In particular, the following aspects should be considered:  
   - the specification and the establishment of SLAs between the SP and 
   the various customers, according to the corresponding SLSes ; 
   - the measurement of the indicators which have been defined within 
   the context of the above-mentioned SLAs, on a regular basis; 
   - the management of the users which have been identified, so that 
   they may benefit from the VPN(s) deployed accordingly. 
    
3.6 Interoperability (TEXT MAINLY DERIVED FROM [Y.1311.1]) 
   Each technical solution should support the Internet standards (in 
   terms of compatibility and modularity). 
    
   Multi-vendor interoperability at network element, network and service 
   levels among different implementations of the same technical solution 
   should be guaranteed (that will likely rely on the completeness of 
   the corresponding standard). This is a central requirement for SPs 
   and customers. 
    
   The technical solution should be multi-vendor interoperable not only 
   within the SP network infrastructure, but also with the customer"s 
   network equipment and services making usage of the PPVPN service. 
    
   Service interworking among different solutions providing PPVPN 
   services should be also supported (in an as much as possible scalable 
   manner). Security and end-to-end QoS issues should be addressed. 
    
    
4 Customer Requirements 
    
4.1 VPN Membership (Intranet/Extranet) 
   - Multiple VPNs per customer site 
    
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                14 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
4.2 Service Provider Independence 
   As customers might ask a provider for a VPN service that spans 
   multiple administrative domains or even beyond the provider"s 
   network, the service should be able to span multiple AS and SP but 
   still act and appear as a single, homogenous VPN to the customer. A 
   customer might also start with a VPN provided in a single AS with a 
   certain SLA but then ask for an expansion of the service spanning 
   multiple AS/SP. In this case, as well as for all kinds of multi-AS/SP 
   VPNs, VPN service should be able to deliver the same SLA to all sites 
   in a VPN regardless of the AS/SP to which it homes. It is undesirable 
   that a VPN that spans multiple AS/SP can only be provisioned with a 
   SLA that only guarantees the least common QoS and SLA parameters. 
   This is of course also dependent on support agreements between the 
   service providers 
4.3 Addressing 
   A variety of customer IP numbering schemes should be supported :  
   - private ; 
   - globally unique : the subscriber has deployed a globally unique IP 
   numbering scheme composed of public IP addresses which have been 
   delivered by the IANA or one of its representatives; 
   - no scheme : the subscriber has deployed no IP numbering scheme, and 
   has made no specific request either : in this case, the IP VPN 
   service offering should be able to address this need, whatever the 
   corresponding provisioning may be (i.e. private and/or public) ; 
   - on-demand : a dynamic IP address allocation mechanism whenever 
   requested by the user, and whatever the access may be, i.e. either 
   permanent or temporary. 
    
4.4 Traffic Types 
   The IP VPN service offering should handle any kind of customer IP 
   traffic - namely multicast and unicast;  
   it might also have the ability to activate the appropriate filtering 
   capabilities whenever required, and whatever the filter may be, upon 
   request of the customer [VPN-NEEDS]. 
    
   It is highly desirable to support multicast limited in scope to an 
   intranet or extranet. The solution should be able to support a large 
   number of such intranet or extranet specific multicast groups in a 
   scalable manner. 
    
4.5 Routing Protocol Support 
   There should be no restriction on the routing protocols used between 
   CE and PE routers, or between CE routers.  
    
4.6 SLA/SLS 
   Every access link must support the specified SLA. 
   From an application point of view, we may at least distinguish 
   between: 
   - SLAs/SLSes for applications which are sensitive either to delay, 
   jitter, throughput or reliability (or a combination of the above-
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                15 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   mentioned criteria)(e.g. real-time applications, such as Voice over 
   IP) ; 
   SLAs/SLSes for applications which are not that sensitive, i.e. they 
   can accept an affordable degradation when being transmitted, even 
   from a user perspective (e.g. transactional applications). 
    
   The negotiation of appropriate QoS parameters according to the 
   specific application requirements is particularly important to deal 
   with SP network congestion periods (sensitive applications would 
   probably negotiate precise guarantees measured on a regular basis, 
   not-sensitive applications will probably rely on a per Class-of-
   Service differentiation).    
    
   According to the DiffServ scheme of QoS support in IP-based networks, 
   a mapping function (from customer DifServ to SP"s backbone 
   DiffServ)should be provided at the edge of the SP network. 
   Support of DSCP transparency[Y.1311.1]: the SP offering the VPN 
   service should be able to set the IP DS field at the egress of the SP 
   backbone to the same value as it was on the ingress of the SP 
   backbone. A rationale for the support of this feature is the 
   following. It is stated [RFC2475] that the codepoints of the DS field 
   of IP packets may be changed within a DS domain by DS interior or DS 
   boundary nodes, but that may not be  sufficient in conjunction with 
   the provisioning of IP VPNs, which may have specific requirements. In 
   particular: 
   - VPN customers using applications with internal CoS solutions should 
   have the possibility to utilize the solutions independent of the DSCP 
   solution supported by the SP infrastructure ; 
   - VPN customers supporting more DSCPs than the SP should have the 
   possibility to use these classes within their physical private 
   network sites ; 
   - carriers" carrier service scenarios should enable a customer SP to 
   offer the VPN service to his VPN customers regardless of the DSCP 
   solution supported by the SP identified as carriers" carrier SP. 
    
   A customer expects to have consistent QoS independent of the access 
   network technology used at interfaces at different sites connected to 
   the same PPVPN. 
    
4.7 Management 
   This section describes the requirements for the customer management 
   in association with the provision of VPN. 
    
   All aspects of management information about CE devices and customer 
   attributes of a PPVPN manageable by an SP should be capable of being 
   configured and maintained by and authenticated, authorized customer 
   agent.   
    
   Dynamic Bandwidth management should allow real-time response to 
   customer requests for changes of allocated bandwidth (control plane 
   should be flexible to accommodate real time changes) [Y.1311.1].

                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
    
    
4.8 Security/Integrity [Y.1311.1] 
   Security mechanisms deployed to support the VPN service offer should 
   be as transparent as possible for the customer excepted maybe for 
   remote customers accessing the VPN through ISDN, PSTN, xDSL or 
   Internet for which AAA services may have to be deployed.    
   Users of an IP VPN should be able and allowed to deploy their own 
   internal security mechanisms, in addition to those deployed by the 
   SP, in order to secure specific applications or internal VPN traffic. 
   Those internal security services should ideally have to conform to SP 
   requirements especially when Quality of Service SLAs have been 
   contracted between the customer and the SP. In such a case, the 
   security solution deployed by the customer should not hide 
   information used by the SP to set up QoS features. Generally, the 
   constraint for the SP, in accordance with the privacy feature of the 
   VPN, is to ensure, as far as possible, that internal security 
   mechanisms which could be deployed within a VPN have a good chance to 
   be transparently supported by the VPN service offer. 
   The VPN will generally be secured according to the customer"s 
   requirements in order to enforce the privacy characteristic of his 
   VPN. This implies that the SP shall in particular ensure that : 
   - every equipment (e.g. router) involved in the set up of a VPN shall 
   be able to identify and authenticate each other so that the traffic 
   exchanged within the scope of a VPN can be routed. Depending on the 
   nature of this traffic and the nature of the equipment involved to 
   process it, this identification and authentication could have to be 
   achieved between CEs and/or between CEs and PE/P routers; 
   - privacy services shall be provided and integrated as a service 
   element by the Provider. Confidentiality and integrity services shall 
   apply to : 
     - either,  all VPN traffic exchanged above the backbone between the 
     different sites ; 
     - or, some limited VPN traffic identified by a combination of 
   source and/or destination IP addresses and/ or protocols and/or 
   applications ; 
     - administration traffic since this latter can contain sensitive 
   information related to VPN configuration, users, security, accounting 
   ; 
   - isolation of each VPN shall be strictly ensured and the operator 
   shall at least have some visibility on intrusion attempts in order to 
   stop those intrusions; 
   - in the same way, access to the various equipment deployed to 
   support the IP VPN service shall be strongly secured in order to 
   prevent unauthorized users to access the IP VPN resources. In 
   particular, the access to the (switching) resources which are managed 
   by the SP will have to be secured to prevent any kind of malicious 
   attack, that may well come from any kind of hacker (internet users or 
   else).

4.9 Migration Impact 
   VPN service customers having already deployed their own private 
   internetwork (whatever the technology) should not suffer from 
   migration considerations (whatever they are), when evolving from the 
   above-mentioned internetwork towards one or more Provider Provisioned 
   VPNs. This migration should be as smooth as possible, both from an 
   economical and technical perspectives [VPN-NEEDS]. Migration should 
   be also allowed without heavy disruption of service. 
    
   Flexible scenarios of customer migration should be allowed, from full  
   migration of all sites to partial migration (e.g. for a given VPN, 
   the migration of some sites to a PPVPN service should still ensure 
   service continuity with the other legacy VPN sites)[Y.1311.1]. 
    
4.10 Network Access 
   Every packet transmitted to or from the customer must have the usual 
   format without VPN-aware encapsulation. 
    
4.10.1 Physical/Link Layer Technology  
   Since a VPN service offering will have to consider the connection of 
   sites which may belong to an enterprise (or a set of enterprises), 
   there should be no kind of limitation in terms of link-layer-based 
   access technology, such as PSTN, ISDN, xDSL, cable modem, leased 
   line, Ethernet, Ethernet VLAN, ATM, Frame Relay, Wireless local loop, 
   mobile radio access, etc. (a wide range of bandwidth should be 
   supported, according to the specific technology in use) [Y.1311.1]. 
    
   To the extent possible, the architecture for IP-layer QoS should be 
   independent of the access network technology. 
    
4.10.2 Remote Access 
   The VPN service offering should allow both permanent and temporary 
   access (to one or several IP VPNs) for its users (again, with no 
   limitation in the type of access technology which may be used as the 
   IP transportation technology). 
    
4.10.3 Sharing of the Access Network 
 
4.10.4 Access Connectivity Multi-homing, Backdoor, Shortcut 
   The following types of physical connectivity scenarios must be 
   supported, such as multi-homed sites, backdoor links among customer 
   sites, etc.  
    
   Support for additional physical connectivity scenarios is desirable. 
   A CE device is usually accommodated by a single PE router.  However, 
   four types of double-homing arrangements, shown in Figure 4.1, should 
   be supported.

   For multi-homing to single SP, load balancing capability should be 
   supported by the PE across the CE to PE links. For example, in case 
   (a), load balancing should be provided by the two PEs over the two 
   links connecting to the single CE. In case (c), load balancing should 
   be provided by the two PEs over the two links connecting to the two 
   CEs.  
    
   In addition, the load balancing parameters (i.e., the ratio of 
   traffic on the multiple load-balanced links) may be provisionable 
   based on customer"s requirements. The load balancing capability may 
   also be used to achieve a degree of redundancy. 
    
   For multi-homing to multiple SPs,load balancing capability may also 
   be supported by the PEs in the different SPs (clearly, this is a more 
   complex type of load balancing to realize, and requires policy and 
   service agreements between the SPs to interoperate). 
    
4.11 Service Access  
 
4.11.1 Internet Access 
   VPN service can be coupled with Internet access per customer site, 
   namely Internet access could be provided for all or part of the 
   customer"s sites. Various options of the Internet access service 
   should be supported [VPN-NEEDS]: 
   - traffic from or to the Internet could be processed by the 
   customer"s IP VPNs ; 
   - traffic from or to the Internet could be rejected (via appropriate 
   filtering capabilities) by the customer"s IP VPNs ;  
   access from the Internet to some of the customer Web-based servers 
   installed in one of his VPN sites (specific security issues need to 
   be addressed). 
    
   In case of combined VPN service and Internet access, support of 
   mechanisms that prevent from compromising the traffic exchange 
   between the customer private address space and the global unique 
   Internet address space should be supported, such as NAT.   
    
    
   This  scenario of providing simultaneous access to the global 
   Internet from any site that belongs to any VPN  can be achieved in a 
   number of ways, again, depending on the VPN mechanism used. For 
   example, if the PE device is composed of virtual routers, then it is 
   possible to access the Internet by means of a dedicated "global" 
   virtual router within the PE device. As previously mentioned, a 
   network address translation (NAT) or similar mechanism may then be 
   required (either at the CE or within the PE device) in order to be 
   able to distinguish private VPN addresses from global Internet 
   addresses. If the PE device does not employ virtual routers, non-VPN 
   (Internet) traffic may be directed by means of a default route to an 
   Internet Gateway.  This default route is distributed to all sites

   within a VPN to provide Internet access to all the sites.  Traffic 
   from the Internet to particular sites within VPNs has to be handled 
   properly by ISPs, by distributing to the Internet routes leading to 
   sites within VPNs.  The internal structure of the VPN would be 
   invisible to the Internet. A firewall function may be required to 
   restrict access to the VPN from the Internet [Y.1311].   
    
4.11.2 Hosting, Application Service Provider 
   TBD. 
    
4.11.3 Other Services  
   In conjunction with a VPN service, a customer may also wish to have 
   access to other services, such as: DNS, FTP, HTTP, NNTP, SMTP, LDAP, 
   VoIP, NAT, LDAP, Videoconferencing, Application sharing, E-business, 
   Streaming, E-commerce, Directory, Firewall, etc. 
    
    
4.12 Hybrid VPN Scenarios 
   NEED COMMENTS - ALL 
   Intranet or extranet customers have a number of reasons for wanting 
   hybrid networks that involve more than one VPN solution type. These 
   include migration, mergers, extranet customers with different VPN 
   types, the need for different capabilities between different sets of 
   sites, remote access, different availability of VPN solutions as 
   provided by different service providers.  
    
   The framework and solution approaches should include provisions for 
   interworking, interconnection, or reachability between different VPN 
   solutions in such a way that does not overly complicate provisioning, 
   management, scalability, or performance. 
    
5 Service Provider Requirements 
   THIS INTRODUCTION TEXT REFERS TO A "NETWORK-BASED VPN" SERVICE: 
   APPROPRIATE ADAPTATION TO PPVPN IS NEEDED. 
 
   The following are some of the customer and provider motivations for a 
   network-based VPN service offering: 
   - Scalability - In a network-based VPN, edge-to-edge tunnels (PE-to-
   PE) need to be established versus end-to-end tunnels between customer 
   sites, as in the CE-based VPNs. Therefore, fewer tunnels need to be 
   maintained and scalability problems of VC-based VPNs (e.g. ATM, FR 
   VPNs) are eliminated. 
   - Outsourcing and manageability - Network-based VPNs allow customers 
   who may not be able to afford the resources to manage their own sites 
   to outsource the VPN management to the SP.  For the SP himself, on 
   the other hand, this presents a revenue opportunity. 
   - Value-added services - Customers seeking value-added services such 
   as multicast, web hosting, flexible SLA management and flexible 
   billing may benefit from network-based VPNs.  Similarly, a SP can 
   attract more customers by providing such value-added services.

                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   Security in terms of isolation and authentication - Security similar 
   to that obtained in VC-based VPNs can be easily provided in network-
   based VPNs.  Higher levels of security like edge-to-edge encryption 
   can be provided based on customer demand. 
    
   The following are some of the generic issues that need to be 
   addressed in a network-based VPN offering: 
   - VPN membership - The PE device needs to determine which other nodes 
   have members belonging to a particular VPN.  In addition to this, a 
   PE router that advertises membership to a particular VPN should be 
   authorized to do so after appropriate verification.  Dynamically 
   creating and changing VPN interconnections and managing them is 
   another aspect of membership that needs to be addressed in a network-
   based VPN solution.  A VPN identification mechanism is essential in 
   order to be able to identify traffic belonging to different VPNs, 
   which may have the same IP addresses. 
   - Route distribution - The distribution of reachability information 
   within a VPN should be done in a secure and constrained manner.  
   Different VPN customers may use the same non-unique IP addresses, and 
   these need to be distinguished on a per-VPN basis.  Since a SP"s 
   network will be shared by multiple VPN customers, care should be 
   taken to preserve isolation between different customers.  In addition 
   to this, customers wishing to access the Internet must be 
   distinguished from those who desire secure access to their own VPNs. 
   - Interworking across multiple AS"s - In an extranet scenario, a VPN 
   can span across multiple provider boundaries or autonomous systems.  
   Care should be taken that security and SLAs are maintained across 
   multiple autonomous system boundaries. 
   - QoS mechanisms and management - One of the main features of the 
   network-based VPN is the opportunity for the SP to provide flexible 
   QoS mechanisms and SLAs across its backbone, since the SP will have 
   complete control over the VPN traffic across its backbone. This 
   opportunity also presents its challenges of providing a simple and 
   efficient QoS mechanism, which is flexible and easily manageable.  
   QoS management systems based on Web-based interfaces to policy 
   servers and policy-based QoS control are highly desirable features of 
   any VPN solution.  The interworking of policies across multiple 
   vendor equipment, as well as the accurate translation of QoS 
   requirements to network parameters is another major challenge. 
   - Security - It should be noted that network-based VPNs can provide 
   security by means of authentication and isolation across the SP"s 
   network. However, encryption in network-based VPNs does not provide 
   end-to-end security since the access links are not under the SP"s 
   control.  However, if encryption across the backbone is a customer 
   requirement, it needs to be provided. 
    
5.1 Scalability 
   Scalable routing capabilities should be supported by the service : 
   - the amount of routing and/or scheduling state in a P router 
   independent of the total number of VPNs supported by the SP and of 
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                22 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   the number of VPN sites. This should be balanced against the 
   requirements of specific services, such as multicast, 
   - the amount of routing (and/or configuration) information on PE may 
   depend only on the VPNs whose site(s) are connected to that PE. 
    
   The content of this chapter tries to express the common understanding 
   among several VPN service Service Providers about scaling 
   requirements over the next several years(which time interval to be 
   considered ?) in terms of projections for number, complexity, and 
   rate of change (THE DIMENSIONS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BELOW HAVE 
   BEEN DEFINED INSIDE ITU-T [Y.1311.1], THE NUMERICAL ASSUMPTIONS 
   REPRESENT A REVISED VERSION OF THOSE PRODUCED THERE). 
    
   The main dimensions characterizing the scalability of a Provider 
   Provisioned  VPN service offering can be quantitatively expressed as 
   the number of supported VPNs to be deployed by the SP, the number of 
   supported terminations (permanent and temporary access)per VPN, the 
   number of routes to be managed per VPN.  
   From that perspective, the technical specification of a Provider 
   Provisioned VPN service offering should consider the following 
   numerical assumptions : 
   - support of a very large number, on the order of 1,000,000, of VPNs 
   per Service Provider network ; 
   - support of a wide range of number of site interfaces per VPN 
   (depending on size or structure of  the customer organization): 
   ranging from a few site interfaces to 50,000 site interfaces per VPN 
   per customer  
   - support of a wide range of number of routes per VPN : ranging from 
   few to 200,000 routes per VPN (this number may be limited by the 
   choice of the routing protocol between CE and PE). Typically, the 
   number of routes I O(2N), where N is the number of site interfaces. 
   - more than one VPN per site should be possible 
    
   Numerical assumptions on VPN frequency of change (e.g. 
   addition/removal of sites per VPN per time unit) could be as many as 
   1 million per year across all SPs within the next 5 years.   
    
   High values of the frequency of configuration setup and change should 
   be supported, e.g. for real-time provisioning of an on-demand 
   videoconferencing VPN.. 
    
   Numerical assumptions for complex deployment scenarios, such as 
   Inter-AS (SP) VPNs and carriers" carrier, should be also provided. 
   Which other dimensions of interest ? (bandwidth , private vs SP 
   network scaling) 
   Also need to consider scalability of management systems. 
    
5.2 Addressing  
   Support should be also provided for an IP numbering scheme 
   outsourcing feature, which may consist for the service provider in 
   managing the IP numbering scheme which has been deployed by or 
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                23 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   allocated to the subscriber, including the multicast addressing 
   scheme. Such a feature could increase the network flexibility in case 
   of growth and the rate of provisioning, and it could even allow cost-
   effective IP numbering resource optimization. 
    
5.3 Identifiers 
   A number of identifiers may be necessary for use in management, 
   control, and routing protocols. Requirements for at least the 
   following identifiers are known. 
   FURTHER INPUTS ON THE USAGE OF A SPECIFIC IDENTIFIER IS NECESSARY. 
   REQUIRES COORDINATION WITH FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT. IF IDENTIFIERS ARE 
   USED, THEN FUNCTIONAL CONTENT, DESCRIPTIONS REGARDING THEIR USAGE, AS 
   WELL AS SCOPE MUST ALSO BE PROVIDED. 
    
   A SP must be uniquely identified at least within allthe 
   interconnected networks of SPs.  (In practice, it should be    
   globally unique.)  This is necessary when a single VPN spans      
   multiple SPs. 
    
   A identifier for each PPVPN should be unique, at least within      
   each SP"s network. 
    
   A CE device should have a unique identifier, at least within each 
   SP"s network. 
    
   A PE device should have a unique identifier, at least within each 
   SP"s network. 
    
   The identifier of a device interconnecting SP networks must be unique 
   within the set of aforementioned networks. 
    
   Each logical port should have a unique identifier, at least within 
   each PE router containing the logical port. Here, a logicalport 
   represents a terminating point of an access link accommodating a user 
   site. 
    
   Each tunnel should have a unique identifier, at least within each 
   router supporting the tunnel. 
    
5.4 Learning VPN Membership 
   The VPN service should support a mechanism that dynamically allows 
   VPN information to be learned PE and CE. This mechanism could be used 
   for different purposes, primarily for service scalability purposes. 
    
5.5 Service Level Agreements and Specifications 
   The Service Provider offering the VPN service has to commit in some 
   specific service quality guarantees which will be part of the 
   contract signed with the customer. The agreement will constitute the 
   Service Level Agreement (SLA) and its corresponding technical Service 
   Level Specification (SLS) for that particular VPN service offer.

                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   A range of (measurable) SLAs/SLSes should be provided on a per-VPN 
   basis to address the various VPN customer needs. A list of  SLAs is 
   provided below (general SLA requirements for IP-based networks are 
   more fully described in [Y.1241], part of them being applicable for 
   VPNs). 
    
   NEED TO REVIEW LIST AND IDENTIFY HOW AND WHERE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR 
   THE IMPORTANT ITEMS WILL BE DETAILED. 
   Service Level  Agreements, per VPN and/or per VPN site, and/or per 
   VPN route should include: 
   o Service Level Objectives comprising some or all of: 
   o IP Transfer Capability 
   o QoS parameters 
   o Availability 
   o Reliability 
   o Delivery confirmation 
   o Mobility and Portability support 
   o Security 
   o Bandwidth 
   o Priority 
   o Authentication 
   o Protocols supported 
   o Flexibility - scaling and connectivity 
   o Life of the SLA 
    
   o Service monitoring objectives 
   o QoS monitoring - comparison against objectives 
   o Flow tracking 
   o Reports as necessary 
    
   o Financial compensation objectives 
   o Billing option 
   o Penalties 
   o Pricing 
   o Early termination charges 
    
   According to the DiffServ scheme of QoS support in IP-based networks, 
   a mapping function (from customer DiffServ to SP"s backbone 
   DiffServ)should be provided at the edge of the SP network. 
   SLSes based on the DiffServ scheme should be provided according to 
   the following classification [Y.1311.1]: 
   - Point-to-Point SLSes (also referred as the "Pipe" model) : the 
   traffic parameters as well as the QoS commitment are specified on the 
   basis of traffic exchanged between the CE at a pair of VPN sites. 
   "Point-to-Point" SLSes are analogous to the SLSes typically supported 
   over Layer 2 technologies, such as Frame Relay and ATM. A VPN SLS 
   which defines compliance to the traffic contract by separate 
   measurement of the packets transmitted from a given VPN site towards 
   each remote destination VPN site is an example of "Point-to-Point" 
   SLS.

                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   - Point-to-Cloud SLSes (also referred as the "Hose" model) : the 
   traffic parameters as well as the QoS commitment are specified on the 
   basis of traffic exchanged between a CE and a PE (as opposed to on 
   the basis of traffic exchanged between CEs). A VPN SLS which defines 
   compliance to the traffic contract by measurement of all the packets 
   transmitted from a given VPN site towards the SP VPN backbone on an 
   aggregate basis (i.e. regardless of the destination VPN site of each 
   packet) is an example of "Point-to-Cloud" SLS. 
   - Point-to-Multisite SLSes : the traffic parameters as well as the 
   QoS commitment are specified on the basis of traffic exchanged 
   between a VPN site and a subset of the other VPN sites.  
    
5.6 QoS 
   Quality of Service (QoS) is expected to be an important aspect of a 
   PPVPN service for some customers. QoS requirements cover scenarios 
   involving a intranet (i.e., a VPN composed of sites from a single 
   customer), an extranet (i.e., a VPN composed of sites from multiple 
   customers), as well as shared access between a VPN and the Internet. 
    
   NOTE: THE FOLLOWING SUBSECTIONS WERE PROVIDED BY DIFFERENT SERVICE 
   PROVIDER AUTHORS, AND HAVE NOT BEEN ALIGNED. MAILING LIST DISCUSSION 
   IS SOLICITED TO FINALIZE THESE REQUIREMENTS. 
    
5.6.1  A Service Deployment Perspective 
   From a service deployment perspective, we may distinguish among : 
   - Provider-managed CE-based VPNs : Quality of Service may be offered 
   based on simple classification based on prioritization, without 
   guarantees, or based on hard guarantees requiring more complex 
   mechanisms to be met.   
    
   QoS can be envisioned to be of two basic types :  
   1. Managed access VPN service 
   The managed access VPN service provides traffic prioritization or 
   service differentiation on the access circuit within the customer"s 
   own Internet/intranet traffic. Service differentiation will be 
   enabled only on the CE router and the customer ports of the PE 
   router. This service does not require implementation of DiffServ in 
   the core or Traffic Policing at the edge of the core network.  
   For the sake of simplicity, three different traffic classes are 
   defined: Real-Time (RT), Non-Real-Time (NRT), and Best Effort (BE). 
   Real-time class ensures that mission critical applications will be 
   given prioritized quality of service for delay sensitive 
   applications. NRT class refers to "better-effort" and is well suited 
   for non-real time applications with higher throughput requirements 
   than a best-effort service.  
    
   The managed access service"s customer will provide the packet 
   classification requirements to the service provider. It is 
   recommended that the SP provides several packet classification 
   profiles to customers. Changes can be made on the profiles depending 
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                26 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   on additional customer requirements. More granular policies should be 
   left to the customer for implementation. 
    
   2. Full-QoS VPN service 
   The Full-QoS VPN service provides an end-to-end differentiated QoS to 
   the VPN customer. The CE router requirements for this model are the 
   same as the managed-access service. In the QoS VPN architecture, 
   DiffServ is enabled throughout the core allowing service 
   differentiation among all customers" traffic as opposed to the 
   managed access service where differentiation is within a customer"s 
   own traffic and only for the access link. 
   In this model, the VPN customer receives a service where a CIR 
   (Committed Information Rate) is specified for both RT and NRT 
   traffic. RT traffic up to CIR_RT is guaranteed low delay, delay 
   jitter, and packet loss rates. NRT traffic up to CIR_NRT is offered 
   low loss rates and moderate delay and delay jitter.  
    
   - Network-based VPN services: 
   In this service the Provider Edge (PE) device performs aggregation of 
   traffic from various CE sites. It should have the ability to support 
   QoS mechanisms based on the underlying network technology (MPLS/ATM 
   etc).  Based on the customer profiles and QoS requirements, as 
   obtained from the policy systems, DiffServ and/or ATM QoS (if the 
   underlying network protocol is ATM) classification may be applied to 
   incoming packets at the PE.  Classification could be based on one (a 
   combination) of a variety of factors like protocol ID, TCP or UDP 
   port number, byte, destination address, source address, 
   Differentiated Services byte etc.  A variety of queueing mechanisms 
   like Weighted Fair Queueing, Weighted Round Robin, Class-based 
   Queuing, Random Early Detection (RED)etc. could be supported.  In 
   addition, shaping and policing may be used to monitor and control 
   incoming and outgoing traffic at the PE.  Each packet"s CoS/QoS 
   attributes may be marked as desired either as a DiffServ Code Points 
   (DSCP) or an ATM QoS class.   
   At the PE router, the DSCPs may be used to define service classes. As 
   for CE-based VPNs, three classes may be used for differentiation of 
   Real-Time (RT), Committed Non-Real-Time (CNRT), and Best-Effort (BE) 
   traffic. Once classified, packets are queued and scheduled for 
   transmission. 
    
5.6.2  A Standards-Based Approach 
   According to the PPVPN charter, a non goal is the development of  new 
   protocols or extension of existing ones. Therefore, with regards to 
   QoS support, a PPPVN shall be able to support QoS in one or more of 
   the following already standardized modes: 
     - Best Effort  (support mandatory for all PPVPN types) 
     - Aggregate CE Interface Level QoS (i.e., "hose" level) 
     - Site-to-site, or "pipe" level QoS 
     - Intserv (i.e., RSVP) signaled  
     - Diffserv marked 
     - Across packet-switched access networks 
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                27 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
      
   Note that all cases involving QoS may require that the CE and/or PE 
   perform shaping and/or policing.  
    
   QoS may be provided on an aggregate level for all PPVPN flows 
   entering and leaving an interface.  QoS in this case applies to 
   packet sent to all destinations, section 5.5 calls this the "point-
   to-cloud," or "hose" SLS/SLA model. Note that the flows originating 
   from multiple sources may congest the interface from the network 
   toward the customer interface. Alternatively, QoS may be provided on 
   a point-to-point basis for a specific set of flows, which section 5.5 
   calls the "pipe" SLS/SLA model. A layer 2 VPN naturally provides this 
   type of QoS. Finally, as defined in section 5.5, there may be a one 
   point to many point SLA/SLS model. How this would map to QoS is to be 
   determined. 
    
   PPVPN CE should be capable of supporting integrated services 
   (Intserv) for certain customers in support of session types of 
   applications, such as switched voice or video. Intserv-capable CE 
   shall support the following Internet standards: 
     - Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP) [RFC 2205] 
     - Guaranteed Quality of Service providing a strict delay bound [RFC 
   2212] 
     -Controlled Load Service providing performance equivalent to that 
   of an unloaded network [RFC 2211] 
      
   PPVPN CE and PE should be capable of supporting differentiated 
   service (diffserv). In diffserv Per Hop Behavior PHB - a description 
   of the externally observable forwarding behavior of a DS node applied 
   to a particular DS behavior aggregate [RFC 2475].  Diffserv-capable 
   PPVPN CE and PE shall support the following per hop behavior (PHB) 
   types: 
     - Expedited Forwarding (EF) - the departure rate of an aggregate 
   class of traffic from a router that must equal or exceed a configured 
   rate [RFC 2598]. 
     - Assured Forwarding (AF) - is a means for a provider DS domain to 
   offer different levels of forwarding assurances for IP packets 
   received from a customer DS domain.  Four AF classes are defined, 
   where each AF class is in each DS node allocated a certain amount of 
   forwarding resources (buffer space and bandwidth) [RFC 2597]. 
      
   It is believed that the need to provide QoS will occur primarily in 
   the access network, since that will often be the bottleneck. This is 
   likely to occur since the backbone effectively statistically 
   multiplexes many users, is traffic engineered, and in some cases also 
   includes capacity for restoration and growth. There are two 
   directions of QoS management that must be considered in any PPVPN 
   service regarding QoS: 
     - From the CE across the access network to the PE 
     - From the PE across the access network to CE 
      
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                28 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   PPVPN CE and PE equipment should be capable of supporting QoS across 
   the following types of QoS-aware packet-switched access networks: 
     - ATM Virtual Connections (VCs) 
     - Prioritized Frame Relay 
     - 802.1d Prioritized Ethernet 
     - MPLS-based access 
     - Multilink Multiclass PPP 
    
5.6.3  Diffserv-Specific Requirements 
   In case of usage of IPSEC tunnels, appropriate mechanisms should be 
   supported in order to not compromise the DiffServ policies across the 
   SP network ([RFC2983] elaborates on this topic).  
   More sophisticated QoS requirements should be also supported when 
   needed, such as Guaranteed Bandwidth tunnels (e.g. edge-to-edge MPLS 
   tunnels in a Network-based VPN). 
    
   NOTE THAT FOLLOWING TEXT IS CURRENTLY DUPLICATED IN CUSTOMER 
   REQUIREMENTS 
   According to the DiffServ scheme of QoS support in IP-based networks, 
   a mapping function (from customer DifServ to SP"s backbone 
   DiffServ)should be provided at the edge of the SP network.  
    
   Support of DSCP transparency [Y.1311.1]: the SP offering the VPN 
   service should be able to set the IP DS field at the egress of the SP 
   backbone to the same value as it was on the ingress of the SP 
   backbone. A rationale for the support of this feature is the 
   following :  
   it is stated [RFC2745] that the codepoints of the DS field may be 
   changed within a DS domain by DS interior or DS boundary nodes. That 
   may not be sufficient in conjunction with the provisioning of IP 
   VPNs, which may have specific requirements : 
   - VPN customers using applications with internal CoS solutions should 
   have the possibility to utilize the solutions independent of the DSCP 
   solution supported by the SP" infrastructure ; 
   - VPN customers supporting more DSCPs than the SP should have the 
   possibility to use these classes within their physical private 
   network sites ; 
   - Carriers" Carrier service scenarios should enable a SP to offer the 
   VPN service to his VPN customers regardless of the DSCP solution 
   supported by the SP identified as Carriers" Carrier SP. 
    
5.7 Resource Control 
   The Service provider should be able to deploy techniques to increase 
   efficiency in terms of network resource utilization, such as Traffic 
   Engineering, and this could possibly done - whenever adequate and 
   acceptable in terms of scalability impact - on a per-VPN basis. 
    
5.8 Inter-AS (SP)VPNs  
   The scenario for VPNs spanning multiple Autonomous Systems (AS)or 
   Service Providers (SP) is a complex one that requires a large degree 
   of standardization.  The scenarios where multiple AS"s are involved 
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                29 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   is the most general case, and is therefore the one described here.  
   The scenarios of concern are the CE-based and network-based L2 and L3 
   VPNs defined in section 2.  
    
   In each scenario, all applicable SP requirements, such as traffic and 
   routing isolation, QoS, management, security, provisioning, etc. must 
   be preserved across PEs in adjacent AS"s.  
    
   An essential pre-condition for an inter-AS VPN is an agreement 
   between the service providers involved that spells out at least 
   trust, economic, and management responsibilities.   
    
The overall scalability of the VPN service must allow the PPVPN service 
to be offered across potentially hundreds of SPs, with the overall 
scaling parameters per SP given in section 5.1. 
    
5.8.1  Routing Protocols 
   If the link between AS"s or SP"s is not trusted, routing protocols 
   run between those AS"s or SP"s should support some form of 
   authentication. For example, TCP option for carrying an MD5 digest 
   may be used to enhance security for BGP [RFC2385]. AS"s/SP"s may 
   specify the AS-path by use of standardrouting protocols. 
    
5.8.2  Management 
    
5.8.3  Bandwidth and Qos Brokering 
   As a VPN should be able to span multiple AS and Service Providers, 
   there is a need for some kind of mechanism that requests certain 
   SLA/QoS parameters from the other domains and/or networks involved in 
   transferring traffic to various sites. This mechanism can be a manual 
   one, e.g. where one provider requests a specific set of QoS 
   parameters for traffic going to and from a specific set of sites from 
   another provider and receives a number of ATM VCs. The mechanism 
   could also be a more automated one where the network itself 
   dynamically requests and receives certain SLA/QoS parameters, for 
   instance negotiates which label to use for different traffic classes 
   for a set of sites residing in a neighboring AS. Or, it might be a 
   combination of both.  
 
   In the case of an automated function, which is desirable, the 
   functionality supported should be for instance to dynamically request 
   and reserve certain QoS parameters such as bandwidth and priority, 
   and then to classify, mark and handle the packets as agreed upon. 
   Observe that as traffic might traverse multiple AS the brokering 
   method should also allow this.  
 
   It is not necessary to perform this kind of brokering on a per VPN 
   basis. Another method might be to make an agreement on a per Service 
   Provider basis specifying the maximum amount of bandwidth and other 
   QoS parameters a service provider might use as a total for all it"s 
   customers usage of the other providers network. Or, it might be on a 
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                30 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   per VPN tunnel basis. The essential is the ability to establish and 
   guarantee uniform QoS across several AS/SP. 
    
5.8.4  Security Considerations 
   If a tunnel traverses multiple SP networks and it passes through an 
   unsecure SP, POP, NAP, or IX, then security mechanisms must be 
   employed. 
    
5.9 Isolation (Traffic, Processing Resources) 
   Routers must isolation VPNs from one another, both with respect to 
   forwarding and with respect to the distribution of routing 
   information. For example, assume that a network contains three 
   routers (A, B, and C) and supports three VPNs (A, B and C). Assume 
   also that each router dedicates one access port to each of the three 
   VPNs. 
    
   Each router must maintain four forwarding tables, a general table and 
   one table that supports each of the three VPNs. When a CE submits a 
   datagram the the network, the PE should forward that datagram 
   according to policy defined by the forwarding table that the CE 
   maintains for that VPN. If that forwarding table does not contain a 
   relevant entry, the CE should execute one of the following 
   procedures, depending upon its configuration: 
    
     1) discard the datagram 
     2) attempt to forward the datagram based upon information obtained 
   from the general routing table. 
    
   The PE MUST NOT forward the datagram based upon information obtain 
   from any other VPNs forwarding table. 
    
   Likewise, routers must isolate VPNs from one another with respect to 
   the distribution of routing information. In the network described 
   above, assume that Router A is connected directly to CE A which is a 
   member of VPN A. Router A may distribute routing information 
   concerning CE A to Routers B and C. Routers B and C may install this 
   information in the forwarding table that supports VPN A, but not any 
   of the other forwarding tables. 
    
5.10 Tunneling Mechanism Independence and Selection 
   Connectivity between CE sites and SP PE to PE nodes in the backbone 
   should not be limited in terms of tunneling technology, such as L2TP, 
   IPSEC, GRE, MPLS, etc. [Y.1311.1] 
    
   A variety of tunneling technologies should be supported inside the SP 
   network between (a pair of) PEs, including MPLS, IPSEC, GRE, IP in 
   IP.  
    
   The tunneling technology used by the VPN Service Provider and its 
   associated mechanisms for tunnel establishment, multiplexing, 
   maintenance should fit the various requirements of the specific VPN 
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                31 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   service offering, such as scaling, security, manageability and QoS 
   related ones. 
    
   To set up tunnels between PE routers, every PE router must support 
   static configuration for tunneling and may support a tunnel setup 
   protocol.   
    
   NEED FURTHER INPUTS ON TUNNEL ESTABLISHMENT AND MONITORING 
   REQUIREMENTS. 
    
   The tunnel establishment protocol must convey information regarding: 
     - Relevant identifiers  
     - QoS/SLA 
     - Restoration 
     - Multiplexing 
    
   There must be a means to monitor the following aspects of tunnels: 
     Statistics, such as amount of time spent in the up and down state 
       Count of transitions between the up and down state 
     Events, such as transitions between the up and down states 
    
5.11 Backbone Technology Independence 
   Considering the physical and link layer technology to be used by the 
   SP"s backbone which will support the IP VPNs, the VPN service 
   offering should not depend on that. Nevertheless, the engineering 
   characteristics of such an IP backbone will have to be taken into 
   account when specifying the IP VPN service offering. 
    
5.12 Protection, Restoration 
   From the access perspective, it should be possible to provide a back-
   up capability whenever the primary access link from a site to one of 
   the IP VPN(s)  fails to be operational. 
   This back-up capability should obviously be as dynamic as possible, 
   i.e. the back-up link should be dynamically established as soon as 
   the primary access link fails to be operational, and should become 
   dynamically idle as soon as the primary access link comes back up 
   [VPN-NEEDS]. 
    
   The Service provider should be able to deploy techniques to increase 
   reliability and fault tolerance of the VPN service offering, such as 
   network protection and restoration mechanisms, and this could 
   possibly done - whenever adequate and acceptable in terms of 
   scalability impact - on a per-VPN basis. Adequate performance 
   indicators should be provided to qualify such capabilities. 
    
   Appropriate indicators in relation with network protection and 
   restoration mechanisms should be provided from the service user 
   perspective. 
   As mentioned in Section 4.10.4 above, in the case of multi-homing, 
   the load balancing capability may be used to achieve a degree of 
   redundancy in the network. In the case of failure of one or more (but 
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                32 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   not all) of the multi-homing links, the load balancing parameters may 
   be dynamically adjusted to rapidly redirect the traffic from the 
   failed link(s) to the surviving links. Once the failed link(s) 
   is(are) restored, the original provisioned load balancing ratio 
   should be restored to its value prior to the failure. 
    
5.13 PPVPN Wholesale 
   The architecture must support the possibility of one service provider 
   offering VPN service to another service provider.  
   This may be useful, for example, when one service provider sells 
   PPVPN service at wholesale to another service provider, who then 
   resells VPN service to  his customers.  
    
   The wholesaler"s VPN must be transparent to the addressing and 
   routing used by the reseller. 
    
   Support for additional levels of hierarchy, for example three levels 
   where a reseller can again resell the VPN service to yet another VPN 
   provider, should be provided. 
   -   -The Carrier"s carrier scenarios belong to this category of PPVPN 
   wholesale. 
  Various Carrier"s Carrier scenarios should be supported, such as: 
  -  the customer Carriers do not operate PPVPN services for their 
     clients;  
  -  the customer Carriers operate PPVPN services for their clients, 
     but these services are not linked with the PPVPN service offered  
     by the Carriers" Carrier;  
  -  the customer Carriers operate PPVPN services for their clients and 
     these services are linked with the PPVPN service offered by the 
     Carriers" Carrier ("Hierarchical VPNs" scenario) 
 
5.14 Management 
   FOLLOWING TEXT IS FROM Y.1311.1  
   Setting up the VPN and managing the deployed devices requires to take 
   care of three main aspects : 
   - connectivity : configuring, provisioning and managing the devices, 
   especially when topology can change 
   - network monitoring (particularly performance and capacity 
   monitoring) in order to meter resources usage and to anticipate 
   scalability problems  
   - security : authentication, authorization and overall policies 
   (including security risks introduced by policy inconsistency). 
    
   In order to facilitate the service management, a logical view of the 
   network indicating VPN topology above the backbone topology is 
   useful. It can be used for provisioning and verification of 
   connectivity, verification of configuration/privacy, fault management 
   and performance management. 
    
   The specification of a management information base (MIB) describing 
   the detailed configuration of network elements involved in the

                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   provisioning of VPN services is a key requirement in network 
   provisioning. The general topic of MIBs for PPVN services will be 
   handled within the framework document.  
    
   ADDITIONAL TEXT NEEDED TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST 
   A management system should satisfy the following requirements: 
   - Control, SLA measurement and accounting on a per customer basis, 
   - Policy for "CE-to-PE" and "PE-to-PE",  
   - Access to VPN parameters (e.g., security keys, location of tunnel 
   initiation/termination points, application-to-DSCP mappings, QoS 
   parameters, etc.) from a secured centralized location,  
   - Access to customer directory services, 
   - New policy and billing implemented in near real time, 
   - Flexibility in terms of service scenarios to be managed, such as 
   customer site connectivity, topologies, deployment scenarios, types 
   of customer IP traffic (v4/v6, unicast/mcast,...). 
    
   FOLLOWING TEXT FOR ALL 5.14.1, 5.14.2 SECTIONS IS FROM ITU Y.1311.1 
   Both the SP and its customers should be able to manage the 
   capabilities and characteristics of their VPN services.  
    
   Automated operations and interoperability with standard management 
   platforms should be pursued.   
    
5.14.1 Configuration Management 
   Following the VPN growth, configuration management for VPNs,according 
   to service templates defined by the provider must be supported. VPN 
   configuration management is needed for basic components such as PE 
   and CE, for example to provision VPN tunnels and access 
   network/links. 
    
   The management system could centralize such a process to guarantee 
   coherence of parameters and accelerate deployment by automating 
   configuration. As VPN configuration and topology highly depends on 
   the customer"s organization, provisioning templates have to apply to 
   the customer"s specific requirements (remote accesses, security 
   policy, QoS). The management system could rely on centralized 
   information to get all needed parameters for optimal adaptation of 
   templates to specific needs. 
    
   Such a system may increase the network reactivity in case of failure 
   or policy violation. It can reduce provisioning delay in case of 
   current VPN configuration requested by the customer (add, modify, 
   delete), which can be a very heavy task in terms of routing tables 
   update. 
    
   In a multi-domain environment, the end-to-end QoS depends on the QoS 
   provided by each domain. In case of a VPN spanning accross two 
   domains, QoS provisioning may reach its limit and such a problem 
   seems difficult to solve.

   Conformance between configured results and customer specific 
   requirements should be verified. This topic is covered in sections 
   5.14.1.3 and 5.14.1.4. 
    
5.14.1.1  Configuration Management for Network-Based VPNs 
   Concrete requirements on configuration management for Network-based 
   VPN are described as follows. 
 
   o The configuration of PE routers must be supported. Their management 
   information includes IP routing information and access control policy 
   information for intranet and extranet membership.  
 
   o Systematic alignment of related identifiers and mapping of these 
   identifiers according to configuration are important when configuring 
   PPVPNs.  Identifiers for SPs, PPVPNs, PEs, CEs, VPN tunnels and 
   identifiers for logical ports as mentioned in Section 5.3 must be 
   configurable to realize desired L2 connectivity and/or L3 
   reachability of the NBVPN. 
   NOTE: ALIGNMENT WITH SEC. 5.3 IS NEEDED 
    
   o Tunnel information must be configured.  It includes the identifiers 
   of tunnels, identifiers of logical links, tunnel states, and QoS/SLA 
   information for QoS/SLA service. 
    
   o Routing protocols running between PE routers and CE devices must be 
   configured per VPN.  For multicast service, multicast routing 
   protocols must also be supported. 
    
   o Routing protocols running between PE routers must be configured.  
   For multicast service, multicast routing protocols must also be 
   supported. 
    
   o The configuration of network-based PPVPN must be coordinated with 
   the configuration of the underlying infrastructure, including Layer 1 
   and 2 networks interconnecting components of PPVPN. 
    
   5.14.1.2 Configuration management for CE-based VPN 
    
   NOTE: TO BE WRITTEN 
    
5.14.1.2  Verification of L2 Connectivity and L3 Reachability 
   It is desirable that a capability to verify the L2 connectivity or L3 
   reachability between CE at user sites within a VPN is provided.  If a 
   logical view of a VPN is provided and the result of this verification 
   is shown in this view, the operator can understand the result easily. 
   NOTE:ABOVE TEXT REQUIRES MORE REVIEW/ POSSIBLE REVISION. 
    
5.14.1.3  Verification of configuration and privacy 
   It is desirable that a capability to verify the configuration and 
   privacy of a VPN is provided.  Privacy here means that the VPN cannot 
   be accessed from outside of this VPN.  If a logical view of a VPN is

   provided and the result of this verification is shown in this view, 
   the operator can understand the result easily.

5.14.2 Service monitoring  
   Network monitoring in the VPN perspective includes the classical 
   items such as fault management, service-level management and 
   accounting. 
    
5.14.2.1  Fault management  
   As VPNs rely on a common network infrastructure, the network 
   management system should provide means to inform the provider on the 
   consequences of a device failure for the VPNs it supported. The NM 
   should provide a logical view of the network indicating VPN topology 
   above the backbone topology. It should provide pointers to the 
   related configuration and customer"s requirement information so as to 
   ease fault isolation and take corrective action as impact on traffic 
   engineering and security considerations may be important. 
    
   To summarize, fault management includes : 
   - customers information of failures, 
   - faults detection (incidents reports, alarms, failures 
   visualization, SLA violation), 
   - faults localization (analysis of alarms reports, diagnosis), 
   - incidents recording, logs,(creation and following of the trouble 
   ticket), 
   - corrective actions (traffic, routing, resources ...). 
    
   It is desirable to detect faults cause by configuration errors, 
   because these may cause VPN service to fail, or not meet other 
   requirements (e.g., traffic isolation). Detection of such errors is 
   inherently difficult because the problem involves more than one node 
   and may reach across a global perspective. On approach could be a 
   protocol that systematically checks that all constraints and 
   consistency checks hold between tunnel configuration parameters at 
   the various end points.  
    
5.14.2.2  Performance management  
   The performance management system should be able to monitor network 
   behaviour  in order to evaluate performance metrics that form part of  
   the service-level agreements. Multiple different VPN services are 
   subscribed by the customers and the system should be able to deploy 
   specific measurement techniques depending on the activated service 
   components (security, multicast, remote access). These techniques may 
   be either intrusive or non-intrusive depending on the parameters or 
   service being considered. 
    
   QoS deployment and SLA monitoring may be coupled by monitoring 
   policies that : 
   - describe QoS mechanisms and the associated metrics that should be 
   activated  
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                36 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   - control monitoring resources such as probes and remote agents 
   Remote agents may be a key to the network monitoring as it allows the 
   collection of statistics directly at the network access points used 
   by customers and mobile users. A logical view of the network 
   indicating the VPN topology helps operators to understand the result 
   of the performance management activities. 
   To summarize, performance management includes : 
   - real-time performance measurements (indicators and thresholds 
   initialization and modification, data collection), 
   - real-time monitoring (resources utilization), VPN status (up/down), 
   - analysis (bandwidth, response time, availability, packet loss), 
   - statistics and trends based on collected metrics. 
    
   Additionally, the performance management system should  have a 
   "Dynamic Bandwidth management" capability : 
   - Dynamic Bandwidth management should allow real-time response to 
   customer requests for changes  of allocated bandwidth (control plane 
   should be flexible to accommodate real time changes) (*) 
   - Performances (e.g. bandwidth allocation) should be traceable 
    
   (*): Dynamic bandwidth allocation would normally occur within the 
   ranges and bounds specified in the Service Level Agreement (SLA), 
   possibly using internal SP mechanisms to check appropriate 
   allocation. 
    
5.14.2.3  Accounting  
   Being able to associate service profiles to customers and to the 
   resources providing these services may facilitate accounting, which 
   can be a key feature of subscribed services. The accounting system 
   has to be able to sort among the huge amount of usage information and 
   correlate this information to performance and fault management 
   information to produce billing according to the real provided 
   service. It should be noted that accounting requirements may conflict 
   with security requirements. 
    
   To summarize, accounting process includes : 
   - measurements of resources utilization, 
   - production of accounting information, 
   - measurement storage (files creation and administration), 
   - quotas control per customer (current consumption update, 
   consumption authorizations checking). 
    
5.14.2.4  Security management features 
   The security management system of a VPN solution must include   
   management features to guarantee the security of network connections, 
   the privacy and integrity of data, as described in section 5.16. 
    
5.14.2.5  Access Control 
   TEXT OF THIS CHAPTER SHOULD BE REVISED TO JUST INDICATE SUPPORT OF  
   SECURITY MANAGEMENT FEATURES FOR ACCESS CONTROL (AUTHENTICATION, DATA 
   PRIVACY). TEXT CURRENTLY PROVIDED BELOW IS A DESCRIPTION OF SECURITY 
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                37

   FEATURES, SO IT HAS A MORE APPROPRIATE LOCATION IN SECURITY SECTION 
   5.16 (REDUNDANCY WITH THIS SECTION HAS ALSO TO BE CHECKED).   
   Access control dictates the amount of freedom a VPN user has, and 
   controls the access of other users to applications and different 
   parts of the network.  
   A VPN without access control only protects the security of the 
   transported data but not the network. Access control capabilities 
   protect the entire network to ensure that VPN users have complete 
   access to the applications, but only to these resources.  
   In case of negotiated customer bandwidth, the access control at 
   network level should ensure that each customer doesn"t violate his 
   contract. 
    
5.14.2.5.1     Authentication  
   Authentication is the process of verifying that the sender is 
   actually who he says he is. 
   Support for strong authentication schemes is particularly important 
   to ensure the privacy of both VPN access point-to-VPN access point  
   (PE to PE) and client-to-VPN Access point (CE-to-PE) communications. 
   This is particularly important to prevent VPN access point spoofing ( 
   e.g. PE fake to enter a specific or a set of VPNs) in the presence of  
   auto-discovery mechanisms.   
   Nomadic access implying dynamic evolution of PEs serving a specific 
   VPN is another situation which requires such authentication schemes 
   in the presence of  autodiscovery mechanisms. A variety of 
   authentication methods are available to meet the needs of particular 
   VPN deployments, including username/password authentication, RADIUS 
   or TACACS servers, LDAP directory servers, X.509 digital 
   certificates, smart cards, ...  
   Scalability is critical when the number of nomadic/mobile clients is 
   increasing. The authentication scheme implemented for such 
   deployments must be both manageable and easily deployed for large 
   numbers of users and VPN access points. 
    
5.14.2.5.2     Data privacy  
   A VPN solution should  protect the privacy of the data being 
   transmitted. Here data means both user and control information.   
   Data privacy could be provided by encryption or by other mechanisms, 
   e.g. data separation. 
    
   It may support multiple encryption algorithms and encryption schemes, 
   including DES, 3DES, and the IPSec standards. Encryption, decryption, 
   and key management could be included in profiles that may be inforced 
   by a policy-based management system. It should be possible to 
   activate encryption on specific services. 
    
5.14.2.6  SLA and QoS management features  
   The management system should support : 
   - specification and the establishment of SLAs between the SP and the 
   various customers, according to the corresponding SLSes ;

   measurement of the indicators which have been defined within the 
   context of the above-mentioned SLAs, on a regular basis. 
    
   FOLLOWING TEXT (SECTION 5.14.3) MAY BE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR FRAMEWORK 
   AS A POTENTIAL SOLUTION -                           - NEED COMMENTS AND INPUT -                                                     - NARAIN, IF YOU 
   HAVE TIME LOOK TO SEE IF LIST IN 5.14.3 IS CORRECT, SHOULD BE 
   AUGMENTED. 
    
5.14.3 VPN management solutions 
    
   The following options are available for deploying management systems 
   for the VPN offering: 
     
   1. Use a call center model for customer control, 
   2. Deploy proprietary or custom-made management solutions,  
   3. Deploy a standards-based, policy-based VPN management solution  
    
   The third option is more scaleable and interoperable and are 
   beneficial to both the customer and the provider. The following 
   chapter describes this option.  
    
5.14.3.1  Policy-based management model 
    
   This model contains four functional areas: configuration; network 
   element; policy engine; and billing. The configuration and billing 
   functional areas provide the customer with a "window" into the 
   provider"s network. Customers can see the level of service that they 
   have and alter it accordingly. The other functional areas view the 
   customer configurations as parameters which must be satisfied.  
    
   This is the first option where the customer can view and configure 
   the network in near real time. The network is configured by either 
   defining policy in a customer owned directory service or by 
   configuring the service by using a web browser. The web browser sends 
   information directly to the policy engine, which is the service 
   control point of the system. The policy engine can also access policy 
   information through LDAP connections to the customer directory 
   service.  
    
   Policy-based management provides the ability to specify rules to 
   govern the behavior of a service. The function of the policy engine 
   involves retrieving and interpreting policy, detecting conflicts, 
   sending the policy to the Policy Enforcement Points (PEP), being 
   aware of network health, SLA requirements, and tracking how customers 
   are currently using the network. The policy engine communicates 
   policy to the PEP by using COPS (Common Open Policy System) and 
   information is communicated back using traditional management 
   protocols (e.g., SNMP). Policy is described by using the Policy Core 
   Schema.

                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   The billing system receives notifications of the changes made by the 
   customer through the policy engine. The customer may view current 
   service parameters at any time by coupling the billing system with 
   the HTTP server.  
    
   Deploying a policy-based system satisfies the following customer 
   management requirements: 
   - Customer control via a web-based service or a directory enabled 
   service, 
   - Flexible administrational policy to any number of elements, 
   - Fully automated to satisfy non-real time requests based on the 
   current network condition.   
    
5.15 Migration Support 
   Service providers must have a graceful means to migrate a customer 
   with minimal service disruption on a site-by-site basis to a PPVPN 
   approach.  
 
   If PPVPN approaches can interwork or interconnect, then service 
   providers must have a graceful means to migrate a customer with 
   minimal service disruption on a site-by-site basis whenever changing 
   interworking or interconnection. 
 
5.16 Isolation, Security, Authentication and Identification           
   SECTION 5.16 COMES FROM [Y.1311.1] 
   The following security functions (described hereafter) should be 
   considered in a PPVPN service offering: 
   - isolation ; 
   - user identification ; 
   - user authentication ; 
   - security of the flow ; 
   - peer identification ; 
   - peer authentication ; 
   - site protection.  
    
5.16.1 VPN isolation 
   From the SP perspective and at a high level of description, the VPN 
   isolation function consists in ensuring that all traffic exchanged 
   within the scope of a VPN remains unknown and protected from other 
   users of the backbone and insensitive with regard to traffic 
   transported over the supporting backbone.  
    
   From this perspective the SP shall ensure, when deploying the 
   service, that it conforms to the following characteristics : 
   - only a set of pre-defined users can access the VPN, 
   - QoS SLA shall be guaranteed whatever the state of the traffic 
   experienced in the supporting IP backbone and especially when this 
   traffic is generated by other customers within or outside the scope 
   of the VPN service, 
   - IP connectivity shall be deployed in such a way that only recorded 
   VPN sites and registered remote users can exchange traffic within the 
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                40 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   VPN. This may lead peer equipment to identify/authenticate each other 
   at different level of the VPN service, 
   - traffic exchanged might be secured thanks to encryption and/or 
   authentication functions, 
   - VPN management functions shall not impact other VPN or IP services. 
    
   This isolation function is achieved by application of a combination 
   of functions related to architecture, quality of service, security 
   and administration functional domains. This set of functions, 
   correctly deployed, constitutes a generic function called "VPN 
   isolation". This function is nevertheless classified within the 
   security domain due to the strong implication of security features in 
   the realization of such a global isolation function. 
    
5.16.2 VPN user identification 
   Among VPN users can be found travelling people who are not 
   permanently attached to one of the sites of the VPN. In order to 
   control the access of those users to the VPN it is necessary to 
   identify them. This identification shall apply within the various 
   deployment context which have been identified (intranet, extranet, 
   sub-vpn), keeping in mind that some of these users can have an access 
   to several distinct VPNs. This identification function can be used to 
   automate or trigger all technical actions which are necessary to 
   establish the communication with the VPN he wants to connect to. Two 
   main identification contexts have to be considered : 
   - identification in case of "mobility", whatever it is an intra-site 
   or inter-site mobility, 
   - identification when the user tries to reach his IP VPN from a 
   public or private access point through a NAS/BAS server or even from 
   a network having an Internet access to which he has a temporary 
   access. 
    
   This function can be implemented by the VPN SP in totality or 
   partially. Roaming capabilities could probably have to be set-up 
   between the Provider and the customer who might well decide to 
   perform the VPN user identification in case he would not accept to 
   outsource the identification/authentication service. In fact this 
   identification will be used by the access SP who needs to identify 
   the user to provide the IP connectivity and by the VPN user 
   identification service in order to accept the VPN connection. The two 
   mechanisms can be linked. 
    
   In this case the access Provider and the VPN SP resources have to 
   cooperate and an agreement has to be reached on common identification 
   specification. 
    
   All information necessary to identify the users will have to be 
   stored and should ideally be maintained by the customer. This 
   information should be made available to the access Provider for 
   controlling the IP access.

                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
5.16.3 VPN user authentication  
   The scope of this authentication function is the same than above and 
   concerns users in a remote access situation. This authentication 
   function will consist in ensuring, with a good level of confidence, 
   that the declared user is the one is claiming to be.  
    
   Various authentication protocols might be used for that purpose 
   depending on the level of security wished by the customer but at 
   least PAP, CHAP and challenged mechanisms should be supported since 
   they are currently widely used in a large range of equipment and 
   services. 
    
   This authentication function may be executed completely or partially 
   by the VPN SP. In the latter case the authentication phase can be 
   relayed to the customer access point according to the terms of the 
   contract.  
    
5.16.4 Securing the flow 
   Within the present context which consist in deploying a VPN over a 
   public IP backbone (which is part of the Internet), the sole routing 
   functions are not sufficient to secure the flows of a given customer. 
   As a matter of fact, even if the flows are correctly routed between 
   the sites (including remote users), the corresponding traffic might 
   be intercepted and consequently read or altered. Securing the flows 
   should be enforced at the network layer to ensure the two main 
   characteristics : 
   - privacy of the traffic, so that only authorized equipment decrypt 
   it, 
   - integrity, to protect recipients from alteration which could have 
   been introduced during the transport. 
   These two functions shall apply to what is called here the "data 
   traffic" of the customer which includes the traffic exchanged between 
   sites, between remote users and sites and even between remote users. 
   But it shall also apply to "control traffic", which is not 
   necessarily perceived by the customer but nevertheless essential to 
   maintain his VPN. 
    
   Even if it is strongly recommended to deploy those functions in an 
   operational context, these functions shall not be considered as 
   mandatory and should be activated only if requested by the customer. 
   In the same kind of idea, those functions should be as flexible as 
   possible so that they can be deployed independently from each other 
   and applied to some part of the traffic (security level may differ 
   depending the traffic which is considered, performance considerations 
   may also lead to secure a sub-set of the traffic).  
    
5.16.5 Peer identification 
   Traffic exchanged within the scope of VPN may involve several 
   categories of equipment that need to cooperate together to provide 
   the service. These network elements can be CE, firewalls, backbone 
   routers, servers, management stations, etc. 
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                42 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
    
   Each time two network elements need to cooperate, it is necessary for 
   the peer to proceed to an identification (enforced by an 
   authentication if needed, see below) before accepting to process the 
   received traffic or to provide the requested service. This 
   identification can be used as a trigger to adapt the way the service 
   will be provided but in most cases to control the access to the 
   network resources. 
    
   This peer identification function is intended here to apply only to 
   network elements participating in the VPN setup. Are excluded here 
   all identification needs related to users" applications. 
   Examples of such peer identification could apply to : 
   - traffic between a CE and a SP access point (P/PE access point), 
   - traffic between CEs belonging to the same VPN, 
   - routers dealing with route announcement (these routers could be a 
   CE and P/PE router or two CEs exchanging routing information), 
   - policy server and a network element, 
   - management station and an SNMP agent, 
   etc.  
    
   This identification function shall not be considered as an atomic 
   function since it is rather distributed and probably implemented 
   differently depending on network elements which are considered. But 
   globally, the VPN service shall provide a peer identification 
   function in defining where it is necessary, how it shall be 
   implemented, how secured it shall be and the way to deploy and 
   maintain identification information necessary to operate the service.  
    
5.16.6 Peer authentication 
   This function is the prolongation, in security terms, of the above 
   function. It aims at authenticating the peer following the same 
   philosophy adopted for user identification and authentication. 
    
5.16.7 Site protection 
   A site might be involved in various ways within the scope of a VPN. 
   It can be part of a VPN deployed to support an Intranet (in that case 
   he is inter-connected with sites belonging to the same company), part 
   of an IP VPN deployed between different companies to support an 
   Extranet, or both. 
    
   Within this context, a site might be subject to various attacks 
   coming from different sources. These potential sources are :  
   - users connected to the supporting public IP backbone, since by 
   definition a IP VPN is built over a public and shared IP 
   infrastructure,  
   - users from the Internet, if the backbone offers an Internet access, 
   - users from remote sites belonging to the VPN the site is part of. 
   Risks that a site may encounter are the following: 
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                43 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   - service denial (when a hacker acts in such a way that a service 
   cannot be used. Mail spamming and access line overloading for 
   instance) ; 
   - viruses ; 
   - intrusions. 
   In order to prevent those risks the VPN SP shall deploy functions 
   that control access to the site, thanks to the deployment of 
   filtering functions provided by firewall for instance but also in 
   monitoring, alerting and eventually logging all suspicious activities 
   in order to detect all possible attacks. 
    
5.17 Provisioning Routing [Y.1311.1] 
   Filtering of VPN routing information in the PE-to-PE and CE-to-PE 
   configurations should be supported. 
   A variety of routing protocols should be supported at the edge and 
   the core level of the Service Provider network : 
   - there should be no restriction on the routing protocols used 
   between CE and PE routers ; 
   - the choice of SP"s IGP must not depend on the routing protocol(s) 
   used between PE and CE routers. Furthermore, that choice should be 
   flexible, not limited to a single routing protocol. 
    
5.18 Provisioning Network Access 
   A service provider must have the means to provision network access 
   between SP-managed PE and CE, as well as the case where the customer 
   manages the CE. 
 
5.19 Provisioning Security Services 
   Deployment scenarios with application of security should be provided 
   (managed CE-based VPNs, L2 VPNs, L3 VPNs) 
    
5.20 Provisioning VPN Parameters 
   Need to have a means to dynamically provision resources associated 
   with implementations of VPN services (e.g., virtual routing 
   instances, table space, etc.). 
    
   The dynamic nature of the VPN resource assignment is crucial to cope 
   with the frequent changes from the customer side (e.g., users joining 
   and leaving the VPN), and achieve scalability. The PEs should be able 
   to dynamically assign the VPN resources. This capability is 
   especially important for dial and wireless VPN services. 
    
5.21 Provisioning Value-Added Service Access 
   A VPN service is from a business point of view quite simple, only 
   providing access between different sites over a common backbone. 
   Other market drivers for the SP business is various kinds of 
   services, and when these are provided through the VPN service itself, 
   we might regard them as value added services. Examples of these kinds 
   of services is for instance Internet access, firewall services, virus 
   screening, IP telephony and IP centrex, application hosting, backup, 
   etc.  It is out of this documents scope to define if and how these 
 
Carugi et al     Informational - Expires August 2001                44 
                    Service requirements for PPVPNs      February, 2001 
 
   different services interact with the VPN in order to solve issues 
   such as addressing, integrity and security. However,the VPN service 
   must be able to provide access to these various types of value added 
   services. 
    
5.21.1 IP Networking Services 
   A VPN service should allow the SP to supply the customer with 
   different kinds of standard IP services like DNS, NTP and RADIUS 
   needed for ordinary network operation and management. The provider 
   should be able to provide IP services to multiple customers from one 
   or many servers. 
     
   The VPN service offering should allow the outsourcing of IP services. 
   The management system could rely on centralized information to get 
   all needed parameters for optimal adaptation of IP services to 
   specific needs. This could also allow cost-effective optimization by 
   offering services at a large range of customers. 
    
5.21.2 Internet access 
   Network-based firewall services must be carrier grade. For redundancy 
   and failure recovery, means for firewall fall-over should be 
   provided. Network-based firewall services that may be provided 
   include virus scanning, traffic-rate limiting against malicious 
   attacks, etc.  
    
   Network-based firewalls must be supported on a per-VPN basis 
   (although multiple VPNs may be grouped into the same firewall).  
   Network-based firewalls should be provided at the major access 
   point(s) for the PPVPN. Network-based firewall services can be 
   embedded in the PE equipment, or can be standalone equipment. 
    
5.22 Provisioning Hybrid VPN Services  
   Service interworking between the identified solutions for PPVPN 
   services and other solutions providing VPN services (e.g. VC-based 
   VPNs) should be also supported. Security and end-to-end QoS issues 
   should be addressed. 
    
5.23 Interoperability 
   Service providers are interested in interoperability in at least the 
   following scenarios: 
     - To facilitate use of PE and managed CE devices within a single SP 
   network 
     - To implement PPVPN services across two or more interconnected SP 
   networks 
     - To achieve interworking or interconnection between customer sites 
   using different PPVPN approaches or different implementations of the 
   same approach
