Abstract

   The currently proposed solution for IPv6 Prefix Delegation is based
   on DHCPv6 protocol.  We believe that in certain network topologies
   and configurations where the CPE routers may not be capable or

   configured to use DHCPv6 and hence can not utilize the currently
   proposed DHCPv6 based ipv6 prefix delegation procedure.  Therefore an
   alternate ipv6 prefix delegation procedure that does not require or
   depend on the DHCPv6 protocol is needed.

   This document proposes an ICMPv6 based prefix delegation (PD)
   mechanism which is in conformance with RFC 3769 that describes the
   requirements for IPv6 prefix delegation.  This proposal involves
   using the Router Solicitation (RS) message for the prefix request and
   the Router Advertisement(RA) message for the prefix delegation.

   A new flag called P-flag (bit 0 of the reserved field) is defined to
   indicate that the RS message includes a PD request.  RS messages with
   PD request can now include PIO option(s) to carry PD information such
   as prefix preference(s) or PD parameters such as lease etc.

   It also proposes defining a new flag called D-flag (reserved bit 26)
   of the PIO option to indicate the presence of PD specific PIO in RS
   and RA messages.

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Prefix Delegation            February 2007


1.  Introduction

   [1] defines neighbor discovery procedures for IPv6 for router
   discovery, prefix discovery, address resolution, neighbor
   unreachability detection and parameter discovery.  It also defines
   the format for the Router Solicitation (RS) and the Router
   Advertisement (RA) messages.

   [2] describes the Prefix Delegation procedure and options to be used
   for Prefix Delegation process using DHCPv6 protocol.

   This document describes IPv6 Prefix delegation mechanism based on the
   ICMPv6 protocol that is used for ND process also.  This proposal is
   in conformance with the RFC 3769 which describes the requirements for
   IPv6 Prefix Delegation.  This proposal is intended for delegation of
   prefixes from a delegating router (DR) to a requesting node (RN).  It
   is also agnostic to the way prefixes are provisioned or managed at
   the delegating Router (DR) or at the requesting node (RN).  The IPv6
   PD mechanism described in this draft is appropriate for all the
   situations for which RFC3633 is appropriate.  But it works without
   requiring DHCP client / server components on the requesting routers
   such as CPE routers.  ICMPv6 based PD mechanism is applicable to
   several different scenarios where IPv6 PD is required but DHCPv6 is
   not.  Neighbor Discovery (ND), SLAAC and ICMPv6 are all integral part
   of the IPv6 stack and hence the proposed mechanism for Prefix
   Delegation does not require any additional components or applications
   on either the requester or the delegator for prefix delegation
   purposes.

   ICMPv6 based PD as proposed in this document does not conflict with
   the DHCPv6 based approach as defined in the RFC 3633.  In fact, both
   mechanisms can co-exist and are not mutually exclusive.  While the
   basic prefix delegation mechanism described in this document is
   different from the DHCPv6 based mechanism, the model and the concepts
   of the IPv6 prefix delegation remain the same.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses some of the terminology defined in IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery RFC 2461 and RFC 3769.

   In addition, this document uses the following definitions:

   a.  Requesting Node (RN): a host or a router that is requesting
       prefix(es) to be delegated from an upstream router





Rao, et al.              Expires August 20, 2007                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Prefix Delegation            February 2007



   b.  Delegating Router (DR): The router delegating prefix(es) to one
       of its downstream requesting nodes

   c.  P-Flag: A flag indicating that sender of the RS message is
       requesting PD.  This document proposes to use bit 0 of the
       reserved field of the RS message.

   d.  D-Flag: A flag indicating that the RS and / or RA messages PIO
       option contains prefix request or delegation.  This document
       proposes to use bit 26 of the PIO option (a reserved bit)



3.  Motivation for ICMPv6 based Prefix Delegation

   The following list summarizes the motivation for this proposal:

   DHCPv6 based Prefix Delegation may not work in all situations such as
   Stateless Automatic Address Configuration where the client routers
   may not have DHCPv6 components deployed or enabled.  Also there are
   certain access technology deployments where CPE routers are not DHCP
   enabled.  Therefore, there is a need for non-DHCP based ipv6 prefix
   delegation mechanism.

   In situations such as mobile networks, Mobile Routers (MR) can take
   advantage of the ICMPv6 based prefix delegation procedure if DHCPv6
   based approach neither available nor enabled in the Mobile Routers.

   Additionally, there has been some customer feedback and requests for
   a non-dhcp based prefix delegation in the ISP space based on the
   complexity of the DHCPv6 based approach.  The simplicity of the
   proposed solution and its potential applicability for an automatic
   hierarchical PD procedure that can be made to work recursively is
   very attractive as it aligns well with the design principles of
   SLAAC.


4.  ICMPv6 based Prefix Delegation procedure

   Though the basic mechanism proposed for prefix delegation is
   different from the DHCPv6 based mechanism, the requirements, model
   and concepts of IPv6 prefix delegation as defined in RFC 3633 and RFC
   3769, still remains the same.

   RFC 2461 defines ICMPv6 based ND procedure, as well as the message
   formats such as Router Solicitation (RS) message, Router
   Advertisement (RA) message and options such as Prefix Information



Rao, et al.              Expires August 20, 2007                [Page 5]

   Option (PIO).  In general, Router Advertisements and per-prefix flags
   allow recipients how the address configuration is performed (Stateful
   and / or stateless).  This specification proposes modifications to
   these ND messages and the PIO option; each will be considered in
   turn.  Additionally, a Requesting Router (RR) can use the modified RS
   message to specify its preferences to the DR.

   In order for a RN (Requesting Node; aka CE) to independently request
   IPv6 prefix delegation, RS message is modified as follows:

   a.  A new flag (P-flag) is defined to indicate that RS message
       includes a PD request.
   b.  In order for the requesting node (RN) to be able to inform the
       delegating router (DR) of its PD preference(s) for prefix(es) and
       / or parameters, RS message will be allowed to carry PIO
       options(s).  PD request without any preferences will have just
       the P-flag set to 1 and does not include any PIO option(s).

   A new flag (D-flag) is defined in the PIO option to indicate the
   presence of prefix(es) delegated in the RA message containing the PIO
   option(s).

   Since the format of the PIO option is common for both the RS and the
   RA messages, if the RS message has the P-flag set, then setting
   D-flag in the PIO option(s) that are included in the RS message for
   indicating preferences is irrelevant.  The information contained in
   each accompanying PIO is understood to be preferred prefix /
   parameter(s).

   IPv6 ND procedure as defined by RFC 2461 allows PIO option to be
   present only in the RA messages.  In order for a RN (Requesting Node;
   aka CE) to independently request an IPv6 prefix delegation, this
   document proposes a change to that policy and modifies the RS
   messages with P-flag set, to carry the PIO option(s).  Setting D-flag
   in those PIO option(s) is irrelevant and as such the nodes receiving
   and processing the RS message with p-flag set need not check for the
   D-flag bit to be set to 1.  RS Messages with P-flag set but do not
   include any PIO options are to be processed as PD requests without
   any preferences.

   All RS messages that do not have P-flag set SHOULD be processed as
   per RFC 2461.

   RA messages containing PIO option(s) without the D-bit set MUST be
   treated as the normal prefix(es) for on-link and SLAAC and SHOULD be
   processed as per the RFC 2461.  RA messages containing PIO option(s)
   with D-bit set MUST be treated as the delegation of prefix(es) to the
   receiving node and SHOULD be processed as per this document.

   There may be cases where more than one DR is present on the link
   shared with the RN.  In cases such as this, the RN will choose as its
   DR the PD capable router whose solicited RA it received first.

   Subsequent RAs received from the remaining on-link PD-capable routers
   will be ignored.

4.1.  Modified Message Formats

4.1.1.  Router Solicitation Message Format

   RNs send RS messages for requesting prefix delegation besides ND
   reasons.

   Modified RS Message format is shown below:


        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      ICMP Fields:

      Type: 133 (8 bits, RS Message)

      Code: 0 (8 bits)

      Checksum: 16-bits.  ICMP checksum.  See ICMPv6 specification.

      P: PD Request Flag. 1-bit.

      Reserved: 31 bits - unused.  MUST be initialized to zeros by the
      sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

      Valid Options: Variable number of options.  Besides Source Link-
      layer Address option, PIO option can also be included with the RS
      message to indicate the PD Request preference(s).  Receivers MUST
      silently ignore any options they do not recognize and continue
      processing the message.

4.1.2.  PIO Option Format

   As per RFC2461, ND messages include zero or more options, some of
   which may appear multiple times in the same message.

   Prefix Information Option type is 3 and is also described in RFC2461.
   Modified PIO option format is shown below, which defines a new flag
   called D-Flag (Delegation Flag) (bit 26 of the PIO option) to be used
   by the ICMPv6 based prefix delegation mechanism.

      octets)

      Prefix Length: 8-bit unsigned integer.

      L: 1-bit on-link flag

      A: 1-bit autonomous address configuration flag

      D: 1-bit delegation flag: If it is set in RS message it denotes
      prefix request and if set in a RA message it denotes prefix
      delegation.

      Reserved1: 5 bits - unused.  MUST be initialized to zeros by the
      sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

      Valid Lifetime: 32 bit unsigned integer. refer to RFC 2461.

      Preferred Lifetime: 32 bit unsigned integer. refer to RFC 2461.

      Reserved2: unused.  MUST be initialized to zeros by the sender and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

      Prefix: IP address or prefix of an IP address.  Prefix Length
      field contains the number of valid leading bits in the prefix.
      Bits in the prefix after prefix length MUST be treated as reserved
      bits and MUST be ignored by the receiver and MUST be set to zero
      by the sender.

4.2.  Message Processing

4.2.1.  RS Message Processing

   The logic below describes the way the RS messages is to be processed
   by the receivers.

           If (P-Flag is set in RS) {
               if (PIOs present) {
                   for (each PIO) {
                        process the PIO as PD request with preferences.
                        do not care D-Flag.
                   }
               } else {
                   process as PD Request without preferences
               }
           } else {  (P-Flag is not set)
                  process as per RFC 2461 (not PD specific).
           }

4.2.2.  RA Message Processing

   The logic below describes the way the RA messages is to be processed
   by the receivers.

            If ( PIOs present) {
                 for (each PIO) {
                      if (D-Flag is set) {
                          It is a PD delegation PIO.
                          process the PIO as PD delegation.
                      } else {
                          process as per rfc 2461 (not PD specific)
                      }
                 }
            }


5.  Error Handling and Notifications

   The PD mechanism should be capable of reporting error and
   informational messages between the RN and the DR.  ICMPv6 messages
   would be used for this purpose.

5.1.  Error Messages

   Error Messages are exchanged between the RN and DR to report critical
   issues that would need to be addressed by either end for the
   delegation process to complete successfully.  The Type field for such
   ICMPv6 message types would be taken from the same value space given
   to ICMPv6 error messages (0 - 127).

   The error message sent in response to PD RS / RA messages SHOULD
   contain the original request that triggered it, as part of the error
   message.  This would enable the receiving node to log appropriate
   error messages with sufficient details.

   The following error messages need to be considered:

   1.  Unavailable Prefix

          This message is sent by the DR to the RN to express it's
          inability to allocate a prefix requested by the RN.  This
          error message could be sent by the DR if

       *  the prefix has already been delegated to another RN
       *  the prefix is not available for the DR to delegate
       *  the RN is not eligible to request this prefix due to policies
       *  the other requirements specified by the RN in it's request
          message cannot be met
       *  the prefix cannot be renewed

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Prefix Delegation            February 2007


          This error message is always sent in response to a RS message
          requesting prefix delegation.  ICMP code field can be used to
          indicate the specific cause of the failure.

          If the RN receives the error message indicating that requested
          prefix is delegated to another RN, it SHOULD log the message
          and SHOULD not request the same prefix immediately.

          If the RN receives an error message indicating the prefix is
          not available for the DR to delegate, it SHOULD log the
          message and SHOULD never request the same prefix.

          If the RN receives an error message indicating the prefix is
          not available due to the DR's policies or due to a failure in
          meeting any requirements specified by the RN in it's request
          message, it could change the requirements and re-send the
          request.  The error message sent by the DR may contain
          information indicating possible parameters for the subsequent
          PD request message to be sent by the RN.

          If the RN receives an error message indicating the prefix
          cannot be renewed, it should log the message and can request
          another prefix.

   2.  Duplicate Prefix

          This message is sent by the DR to the RN to suggest that the
          requested prefix has already been allocated to the RN.  This
          message is sent by the DR if it receives a PD RS from the RN
          for the same prefixes too soon.  The DR might consider this as
          a indication that the RA containing the prefix options was not
          received by the RN.

          On receipt of a Duplicate Prefix error message from the DR,
          the RN can start using the prefix requested.  The lifetime
          fields should be considered valid from the time of the
          original request.

          If the RN had not made a request for the prefix, it must
          silently discard the message.

   3.  Revoked Prefix

          This message is sent by the DR to the RN to suggest that an
          already allocated prefix has now been revoked and the RN MAY
          NOT continue to use it.  Typically, this occurs when there is
          a renumbering done by the DR and it's originally assigned set
          of prefixes.  This message is not generated in response to any

          RS message unlike the Unavailable Prefix error message.

          On receipt of a Revoked Prefix error message from the DR, the
          RN SHOULD immediately stop using the prefix.  If the Revoked
          Prefix was never requested or allocated to the RN, the message
          MUST be silently discarded.


5.2.  Notification Messages

   Type values for these messages fall between 128 - 255 as per rfc
   2463.

   The following informational messages are defined for the prefix
   delegation mechanism.

   Returned Prefix

      This message is sent by the RN to the DR to suggest that it does
      not require the prefix any more.  The DR would then be able to add
      this prefix to it's existing pool and delegate it to other RNs if
      possible.  This message may or may not be sent as a response to a
      RA message delegating prefixes.

      This message MUST contain the prefix(es) returned using the PIO
      option format so that the DR can free up the allocation of
      appropriate prefixes.

      If the DR has not delegated the prefix(es) being returned, it MUST
      silently discard the message.


   Any other messages should be processed as per ICMPv6 specification.


6.  Configuration Variables

   The following Variables need to be considered

   1.  MinPDMsgTxInterval

          The MinPDMsgTxInterval variable defines the time between two
          successive PD error/informational messages sent by one node to
          another.  The node has to wait for MinPDMsgTxInterval before
          re-transmitting a message.

   ND Configuration Variables such as RTR_SOLICITATION_INTERVAL and
   MAX_ROUTER_SOLICITATIONS etc. (defined in RFC 2461) SHOULD be honored

   by this prefix delegation procedure for the purpose of rate limitting
   the RS and RA messages.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a few amendments to the [1] and does not
   introduce any new security threats.  To reduce the threats associated
   with ND it is recommended that deployments use SeND [3] to secure
   neighbor discovery messages.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines new ICMPv6 message types in Sections 5.1 and
   5.2 which requires IANA to assign codes for these new ICMPv6
   messages.
