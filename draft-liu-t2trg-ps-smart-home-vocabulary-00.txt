1.  Introduction

   Smart home is one of vertical applications of Internet of Things
   (IoT).  The deployment of smart home applications and systems often
   requires various types of devices (for example, home appliances) from
   different device manufacturers, and each device requires multiple
   properties and/or methods (for example, switch, mode, etc.)
   supported.

   Now, many consortiums are working on device models to descibe the
   properties and methods of IoT devices, like information model to
   describe the data produced by device, and interaction model to define
   how to interact with device.  However, simply relying on device model
   still cannot guarantee the semantic interoperability.

   Current device information model vocabularies for smart home are
   often tightly coupled to limited number of device manufacturers, thus
   resulting in relatively rigid and static device vocabularies.  The
   static nature of such device vocabularies greatly reduces and, in
   many cases, limits the ability of a smart home service provider to
   introduce new or modify existing device properties and/or methods.

   This document outlines the problems encountered with existing device
   information model vocabularies for smart home, and provides the
   requirement that is necessary to solve the problem.

2.  Problem Statement

   The following points describe aspects of existing smart home device
   vocabularies that are problematic.

Internet-Draft   Smart Home Vocabulary Problem Statement    October 2016


2.1.  Device Information Model Vocabulary Fragmentation

   Device information model vocabularies are often coupled to specific
   device manufacturers.  Even for same kind of device type, the
   information model's properties and command are different.  For
   example, for the air conditioner, manufacturer A may define its
   switch feature as "on", and define value 1 as "switch on" and value 0
   as "switch off"; whereas, manufacturer B may define the switch
   feature as "open", and define value 1 as "switch on" and value 0 as
   "switch off".

   Such Fragmentation imposes constraints on smart home deployment,
   potentially inhibiting the smart home service provider from providing
   smart device interaction function for customers, and reduces
   flexibility because it would be difficult to support devices from new
   manufacturers.

   One possible solution is to define an unified information model
   specification.  Each device manufacturer can map its private device
   information model, thus helping to bridge between different device
   information model.  This information model could be implemented on
   the IoT service platform in the cloud or locally on the smart home
   appliacne.  If implemented on Intrnet server, it is easy for device
   manufacturers to configure the mapping, but it may bring extra cost
   to IoT service platform as well as increase its complexity.  If
   implemented locally, it could bring better user experience since the
   briding is completed locally, but the updating of device information
   model would be difficult.

2.2.  Standardization of Information Model

   Even though many consortiums are working on defining an universal
   device information model for smart home, there is still no dominant
   standard that can cover the requirements of most manufacturers.

   ZigBee Alliance is working on "ZigBee Cluster Library", which defines
   the device model as well as the detailed device vocabulary for smart
   home.  But it is only limited to ZigBee environment.

   OCF is working on "Smart Home Device Specification", which defines
   the device model and vocabulary for smart home.  But the vocabulary
   is very basic, thus cannot satisfy the requirement of samrt home
   implementation.

   W3C is also woring on TD (Things Description) standards.

   However, those information model related standards only trying to
   standardize the way of describing the IoT device's property and its

   command.  The difficulty is that there is no common "vocabulary" for
   the information model of the IoT device.  Although the information
   model could be standardized, it is still impossible to interoperate
   in this case.

3.  Proposed Solution

   Define an unified "vocabulary" standards for the information model of
   smart home.  This standards could be crucial to enable interoperate
   for smart home appliance.
