         Deprecation of BGP Entropy Label Capability Attribute
             draft-ietf-mpls-deprecate-bgp-entropy-label-00

Abstract

   RFC 6790 defines the BGP Entropy Label Capability attribute.
   Regrettably, it has a bug: although RFC 6790 mandates that Entropy
   Label-incapable routers must remove the attribute, in practice this
   requirement can't be guaranteed to be fulfilled.  This specification
   deprecates the attribute.  A forthcoming document will propose a
   replacement.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC6790] defines the Entropy Label Capability attribute (ELCA), an
   optional, transitive BGP path attribute.  For correct operation, it
   is necessary that an intermediate node modifying the next hop of a
   route must remove the ELCA unless the node so doing is able to
   process entropy labels.  Sadly, this requirement cannot be fulfilled
   with the ELCA as specified, because it is an optional, transitive
   attribute: by definition, a node that does not support the ELCA will
   propagate the attribute.  (This is a general property of optional,
   transitive attributes, see [RFC4271].)  But such an ELCA-oblivious
   node is likely to also be entropy label-incapable and is exactly the
   one that we desire to remove the attribute!

   This specification updates RFC 6790 by deprecating the version of
   ELCA defined in Section 5.2 of that document.  A forthcoming document
   will propose a replacement.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  IANA Considerations

   For the reasons given in Section 1, IANA is requested to mark
   attribute 28 in the "BGP Path Attributes" registry as "deprecated",
   reference this RFC.

3.  Security Considerations

   ELCA as defined in [RFC6790] S. 5.2, has in common with other
   optional, transitive path attributes the property that it will be
   "tunneled" through intervening routers that don't implement the
   relevant specification.  Unfortunately, as discussed elsewhere in
   this document, implementations of [RFC6790] S. 5.2 receiving such
   "tunneled" attributes could -- sometimes improperly -- rely on them.
   The consequence of so doing could be a black hole in the forwarding
   path for the affected routes.  Whether this is a new security issue
   or not is somewhat debatable, since to be exploited an attacker would
   have to be part of the control plane path for the route in question,
   and under those circumstances an attacker already has a panoply of
   mischief-making tools available, as discussed in [RFC4272].

   In any case, this document renders any real or imagined security
   issues with ELCA moot, by deprecating it.
