Internet-Draft              XMPP URI Format                February 2004


1. Introduction

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [XMPP-CORE] has
   been adapted by the XMPP WG from the open protocol originally
   developed by the Jabber community.  Currently the Jabber/XMPP network
   contains tens of thousands of servers and millions of other entities.
   Within the context of the streaming XML technology that forms the
   foundation of XMPP, the addresses of XMPP entities are not specified
   as full URIs.  However, many applications external to the existing
   network would like to address XMPP entities as full URIs in
   compliance with RFC 2396 [URI].

   Many types of application can be built using XMPP.  The best-known
   such application is instant messaging (IM) and presence (as described
   in [IMP-MODEL] and [IMP-REQS] and defined for XMPP in [XMPP-IM]).
   Therefore it might seem appropriate to use the im: and pres: URI
   schemes specified by Common Profile for Instant Messaging (CPIM)
   [CPIM] and Common Profile for Presence (CPP) [CPP], rather than to
   define an XMPP-specific URI scheme.  However, while the im: and pres:
   URI schemes are appropriate for instant messaging and presence
   applications and are therefore specified in [XMPP-IM], they may not
   be appropriate for all XMPP applications.  Because XMPP is a
   technology for near-real-time messaging, presence, and
   request-response services using streaming XML, XMPP applications may
   not be IM and presence applications (i.e., they may conform to
   [XMPP-CORE] but not [XMPP-IM]).  Indeed, XMPP is already used in
   applications quite distinct from IM and presence, including network
   management, workflow applications, generic publish-subscribe, remote
   procedure calls, content syndication, gaming, and middleware.  These
   applications require an addressing scheme that is not tied to the
   particular semantics of the im: and pres: URI schemes.  Therefore,
   this document defines a generic URI scheme that will enable
   applications to address as a URI any entity that can communicate via
   XMPP (not merely instant messaging and presence entities).

   On the XMPP network itself, entities are addressed as
   <[node@]domain[/resource]> (i.e., without a URI scheme) rather than
   as <xmpp:[node@]domain[/resource]>.  However, some interfaces to XMPP
   services may be provided by non-native applications (e.g., web
   browsers), and other applications (e.g., databases) may want to refer
   to XMPP entities using addresses that are full URIs.  The xmpp: URI
   format is provided for the sake of such interfaces and applications,
   and MUST NOT be used by native applications for addressing of XML
   stanzas sent over the XMPP network itself.

   The xmpp: URI is opaque rather than hierarchical, and thus is similar
   to a mailto: URI as specified by RFC 2368 [MAILTO].  Because an xmpp:
   URI is opaque, it SHOULD contain only the node identifier (optional)

   and domain identifier (required) portions of a JID as defined in
   Section 3 of [XMPP-CORE] (including by reference all relevant
   stringprep profiles).  An xmpp: URI MAY include the resource
   identifier portion of a JID if the XMPP entity must be addressed as
   such, but this is not recommended since the delimiter used before a
   resource identifier in XMPP addresses is the slash character ("/"),
   which is discouraged by [URI] in opaque URIs.

   If an xmpp: URI is presented in an end-user application that provides
   an non-native interface to an XMPP service (e.g., in a web browser),
   interacting with such a URI SHOULD trigger the application to present
   a user with an appropriate interface to complete an action such as
   sending a message, sending presence, managing a subscription, sending
   an information request (IQ get), or updating relevant information (IQ
   set).

   This memo conforms to the requirements in Registration Procedures for
   URL Scheme Names [URL-REG].  This memo also follows the
   recommendations in Guidelines for new URL Schemes [URL-GUIDE].

1.1 Terminology

   This document inherits terminology described in [XMPP-CORE].

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [TERMS].

1.2 Discussion Venue

   The author welcomes discussion and comments related to the topics
   presented in this document.  The preferred forum is the
   <xmppwg@jabber.org> mailing list, for which archives and subscription
   information are available at <http://www.jabber.org/cgi-bin/mailman/
   listinfo/xmppwg/>.

2. xmpp: URI IANA Registration

   This section provides the information required to register the xmpp:
   URI scheme.

2.1 URI Scheme Name

   xmpp

2.2 URI Scheme Syntax

Internet-Draft              XMPP URI Format                February 2004


   The syntax for an xmpp: URI is defined below using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form as specified by [ABNF].  The jid rule is defined in
   [XMPP-CORE].

   XMPP-URI = "xmpp:" jid


2.3 Character Encoding Considerations

   Representation of non-ASCII character sets in local-part strings is
   limited to the standard methods provided as extensions to RFC 2822
   [IMF].

2.4 Intended usage

   The xmpp: URI is intended to be used by interfaces to the XMPP
   network from non-native user agents such as web browsers, as well as
   by applications that need to address XMPP entities as full URIs.

2.5 Security considerations

   See Security Considerations (Section 4) of this document.

2.6 Relevant publications

   [XMPP-CORE], [XMPP-IM]

2.7 Person and email address to contact for further information

   Peter Saint-Andre [mailto:stpeter@jabber.org]

2.8 Author/Change controller

   This scheme is registered under the IETF tree.  As such, the IETF
   maintains change control.

2.9 Applications and/or protocols which use this URI scheme name

   Applications that provide an interface to XMPP services or that need
   to address XMPP entities as full URIs.

3. IANA Considerations

   This entire document addresses IANA considerations.

4. Security Considerations

   Detailed security considerations for XMPP are given in [XMPP-CORE].

   Providing an interface to XMPP services from non-native applications
   introduces new security concerns.  For example, the ability to
   interact with XMPP entities via a web browser may expose sensitive
   information to attacks that are not possible or unlikely on a native
   XMPP network.  Due care must be taken in deciding what information is
   appropriate for representing in xmpp: URIs; in particular, passwords
   MUST NOT be represented.
