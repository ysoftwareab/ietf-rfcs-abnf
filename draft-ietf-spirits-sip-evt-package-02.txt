Toward the Definition of the SIP Events Package for SPIRITS Protocol

Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with all
   provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task
   Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that other groups
   may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.
   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material
   or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

1. Abstract

   This document describes the definition of the SIP Event
   Package for SPIRITS, based on on the structure defined in [1], the
   SPIRITS protocol requirements documented in [2], the overall SPIRITS
   Architecture presented in RFC 3136 [3], the discussion at the
   Salt Lake City meeting, and the subsequent decisions. To this end,
   the document defines the package and event names, and addresses
   the SUBSCRIBE paramaters.

   This document is not intended as a stand-alone one; instead, it is
   expected to be a module of the future SPIRITS protocol RFC when merged
   with the work developed in [4] and other protocol-specific contributions.
   For this reason, this document is not self-sufficient; the information in
   references [2] and [3] is essential in understanding this Internet-Draft.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

3. Introduction

   The rest of this document is organized as follows: section 4 defines the
   package; section 5 provides a table for IANA registration; and sections
   6, 7, and 8 respectively contain, acknowledgements, references, and
   authors' addresses.

4. Definition of the Packages' and Subpackages' Names

   The SPIRITS events package, named "spirits," has two subpackages:
   "INDPs,"  for the events that correspond to IN Detection points;
   and "user-prof", for the events related to the user profile
   information.  The semantics of these packages is explained in
   the following subsections.

4.1 Sub-package "INDPs"

   INDPs is a terminal sub-package. The information specific to the IN
   Detection Points (DPs), including the names of the DPs is encoded..
   According to [2], the following DPs are handled in this way:

       "OAA" (origination_attempt_authorized)
       "AI"  (Analyzed Info)
       "CI"  (Collected_Info)
       "OA"  (O_Answer)
       "OTS" (O_Term_Seized)
       "TAns"(T_Answer)
       "ONA" (O_No_Answer)
       "RSF" (Route_Select_Failure)
       "TNA" (T_No_Answer)
       "OCB" (O_Called_Party_Busy)
       "OMC" (O_Mid_Call)
       "TMC" (T_Mid_Call)
       "OA"  (O_Abandon)
       "OD"  (O_Disconnect)
       "Tab" (T_Abandon)
       "TD"  (T_Disconnect)
       "TAA" (Termination_Attempt_Authorized)
       "FSA" (Facility_Selected_and_Available)
       "TB"  (T_Busy)

   The DP information is XML-encoded and carried in
   the body of the SUBSCRIBE, as shown in the following
   example:

      SUBSCRIBE sip:gateway.provide.com SIP/2.0
      Events: spirits.INDPs
      Content-Type: application/spirits-events
      Content-Length: 27

      <spirit-event>
         <DP=CI/>
      </spirit-event>
      ...

   The XML schema and DTD for the bodies of both the SUBSCRIBE and
   NOTIFY messages  are described in the companion document.


   4.2 Sub-package "user-prof"

   Similarly, the "user-prof" sub-package is terminal.

   Its specific events are

      "LUS"   (Location Update in the same VLR service area)
      "LUA"   (Location Update in another VLR service area)
      "IA"    (IMSI Attach)
      "MSID"  (MS-initated IMSI Detach)
      "NID"   (Network-initiated IMSI Detach)

   An example of encoding this information
   in the body of the SUBSCRIBE is as follows:

      SUBSCRIBE sip:gateway.provide.com SIP/2.0
      Events: spirits.INDPs
      Content-Type: application/spirits-events
      Content-Length: 27

      <spirit-event>
         <event=LUS>
      </spirit-event>
      ...

   Figure 1 summarizes the package naming and the respective
   functions of both packages as a tree, whose leaves denote
   the XML-encoded information.
