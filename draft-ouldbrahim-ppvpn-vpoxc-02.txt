     Abstract 
         
        This document describes a GMPLS-based Virtual Private Network 
        service called GMPLS-based Virtual Private Cross-Connect 
        (VPOXC). A VPOXC is a provider provisioned VPN service part of 
        the customer private network but administered and under the 
        control of the service provider. A VPOXC operates similarly to a 
        physical optical cross-connect except that it allows a wide 
        spectrum of port topology such as hub and spoke, full mesh, and 
        arbitrary topologies. To the VPOXC customer, the service 
        provider network appears as a virtual private optical cross-
        connect where customer sites are attached to. The VPOXC port 
        topology is defined by the customer, and enforced by the service 
        provider. Customers can signal any optical connectivity 
        according to the port topology implemented by the VPOXC. Client 
        devices operate within the VPOXC space independently from the 
        service provider network operations.  
      
     Sub-IP Summary ID 
      
        This ID targets the PPVPN working group as it deals with a 
        port-based VPN service. This document describes a GMPLS-based 
        Virtual Private Network service called GMPLS-based Virtual 
        Private Cross-Connect (VPOXC). A VPOXC is a provider provisioned 
        VPN service administered and under the control of the service 
        provider. A VPOXC operates similarly to a physical optical 
        cross-connect except that it is using shared resources and 
        implements a wide spectrum of port topology besides just the 
        full mesh port topology. To the VPOXC customer, the service 
        provider network appears as a virtual private optical cross-
        connect where customer sites are attached to. The VPOXC port 
        topology is defined by the customer, and enforced by the service 
        provider. Customers can signal any optical connectivity 
        according to the topology implemented by the VPOXC. Client 
        devices operate within the VPOXC space independently from the 
        service provider network operations.

     WHERE DOES IT FIT IN THE PICTURE OF THE SUB-IP WORK 
         
        Fits the PPVPN box. 
         
     WHY IS IT TARGETED AT THIS WG 
         
        This WG is looking at port based VPN services and solutions. 
        This work addresses a port-based Optical VPN service. 
         
     JUSTIFICATION 
         
        VPOXC based Optical VPNs can also be provided using Provider 
        Provisioned VPN mechanisms. The service described in this draft 
        fits most of the generic requirements for PPVPN (similarly to 
        l2vpn or VPLS). 
         
      
     1. Introduction 
         
        This document describes a GMPLS-based Virtual Private Network 
        service called GMPLS-based Virtual Private Cross-Connect 
        (VPOXC). A VPOXC is a provider provisioned VPN service 
        administered and under the control of the service provider. A 
        VPOXC operates similarly to a physical optical cross-connect 
        except that it is using shared resources and implements a wide 
        spectrum of port topology besides just the full mesh port 
        topology (hub and spoke, arbitrary and full mesh are private 
        port topologies that can be supported within the VPOXC). To the 
        VPOXC customer, the service provider network appears as a 
        virtual private optical cross-connect where customer sites are 
        attached to. The VPOXC port topology is defined by the customer, 
        and enforced by the service provider. Customers can signal any 
        optical connectivity according to the topology implemented by 
        the VPOXC. Client devices operate within the VPOXC space 
        independently from the service provider network operations.  
         
        The bandwidth associated with each VPOXC depends on the access 
        bandwidth of each CE to the VPOXC and the port topology 
        implemented within the VPOXC. As sites are added or removed to 
        the VPOXC, the total VPOXC bandwidth is accordingly adjusted. 
      
        Given the fact that VPOXCs are optical virtual private network 
        services, therefore they are subject to the same requirements 
        described in [OVPN-REQ]. 
         
      
     2. VPOXC Service Model 
         
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.           July  2003                      [Page 3] 
                      draft-ouldbrahim-ppvpn-vpoxc-02.txt     December 2002 
      
      
        A VPOXC customer defines a port topology to be supported by 
        service provider. Within this port topology, the customer 
        selects any connectivity topology. The service provider 
        restricts and constrains port-to-port connectivity according to 
        the topology implemented within the VPOXC.  
         
        A service provider network offering VPOXC services consists of 
        devices such as Optical Network Element (ONE) which may be 
        Optical Cross Connects (OXCs), or SONET/SDH Cross Connects. We 
        partition these devices into P (provider) ONEs and PE (provider 
        edge) ONEs. The P ONEs are connected only to the ONEs within 
        the provider's network. The PE ONEs are connected to the ONEs 
        within the provider network, as well as to the devices outside 
        of the provider network. We'll refer to such other devices as 
        Client Edge Devices (CEs). An example of a CE would be a 
        router, or a SONET/SDH Cross Connect, or an Ethernet switch. To 
        each CE part of the same VPN the service provider appears a 
        virtual private optical cross-connect where customer ports are 
        attached to it.

        For the purpose of the VPOXC service, the resources used to 
        connect a CE to a (VPOXC) PE are represented as TE link [CCAMP-
        ROUTING]. As such, all the constructs (e.g., link bundling) 
        applicable to TE links are applicable here as well. For a given 
        TE link that connects a CE to a (VPOXC) PE the end point of 
        that link connected to the CE is referred to as "CE port", 
        while the end point of that link connected to the (VPOXC) PE is 
        referred to as "VPOXC port". 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.           July  2003                      [Page 4] 
                      draft-ouldbrahim-ppvpn-vpoxc-02.txt     December 2002 
      
      
         
         
        The basic unit of the VPOXC service is an optical or TDM  
        connection between a port on one CE and a port on another CE 
        through the VPOXC. The TDM connection (also referred to TDM LSP 
        in the GMPLS context) rules are driven by [GMPLS-SONET-SDH] for 
        SDH/Sonet interfaces. These rules must be used when 
        establishing TDM connections from CE-port(s) to CE-port(s) over 
        the VPOXC. The number of ports depends on the concatenation 
        capabilities of these interfaces keeping in mind that when 
        provided, virtual concatenation does not constraint the VPOXC 
        port capability. If a port on CE has multiplexing capabilities, 
        the same port could be used to connect to more than one 
        (remote) CE ports. 
      
        Ports within a VPOXC need not have the same characteristics 
        But only ports with compatible characteristics could be 
        connected (e.g., GigE port to GigE port , but not GigE port to 
        OC-48 port). Furthermore, administrative ownership of VPOXC 
        ports is orthogonal to the VPN membership of these ports 
        _Ports within a VPOXC could belong to the same (intranet), or 
        different (extranet) organizations. Association between a CE 
        with a particular VPOXC is established/maintained by the 
        Provider's provisioning system and therefore could be changed 
        only via provider's provisioning system. 
         
        A VPOXC port can be moved to another PE port (or even to 
        another PE) without changing the VPOXC addressing used by the 
        customer to request optical connectivity. 
        Addition/Deletion/Changes of the VPOXC port addresses requires 
        no coordination with the service provider addressing scheme. 
         
        Each VPOXC is associated with one or more control channels used 
        by the CEs to request optical connections. The control channel 
        is addressed using addresses defined within the private network 
        addressing space. Note that a control channel can be an IP 
        tunnel, FR/ATM VCs, etc. Each PE that provides multiple VPOXC 
        services is going to have multiple control channels, one per 
        VPOXC. 
      
         
        The VPOXC ports can be identified by either network layer 
        addresses (e.g., IPv4 addresses), or by a combination of PE ONE 
        identifier and a port/interface index (e.g., IP unnumbered 
        interfaces). A VPOXC service assumes that all the CE ports that 
        are attached to a given VPOXC have identifiers that are 
        unambiguous within that VPOXC. The service provider should not 
        assume that these identifiers are unambiguous outside of that 
        VPOXC. CE ports attaching to the VPOXC can be identified by 
        either network layer addresses (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, NSAP 
        addresses), or by a combination of CE identifier and a 
        port/interface index (e.g., IP unnumbered interfaces). 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.           July  2003                      [Page 5] 
                      draft-ouldbrahim-ppvpn-vpoxc-02.txt     December 2002 
      
      
      
        The VPOXC addressing, routing, and signaling used by the 
        Service Provider network offering the service are completely 
        independent from the addressing, routing, and signaling used by 
        the VPOXC clients of that network. Moreover, for the purpose of 
        the VPOXC service, addressing, routing and signaling used by 
        one VPOXC client, need not be coordinated with any other VPOXC 
        clients. 
         
        To simplify operations and for better scalability and stability 
        purposes, the VPOXC service can be implemented using mechanisms 
        by which a given CE that has at least one port associated with 
        a given VPOXC could learn about all other ports of that VPOXC, 
        even if these ports are on other PE ONEs, and even if these 
        other PE ONEs belong to some other service providers. 
        Furthermore, as a value added service, a service provider may 
        provide a CE that has at least one port in a given VPOXC with 
        the information related to all other CE ports of that VPOXC, 
        including the information about various properties of these 
        ports. 
         
        Given the fact that a VPOXC is part of the customer private 
        network, VPOXC customer may choose to run private routing 
        protocol within the VPOXC (for example using both GMPLS 
        signaling and GMPLS routing at the VPOXC level). Private 
        routing exchange will be discussed in future revisions of this 
        draft. 
       
      
     3. Security Considerations 
         
        In order to meet privacy requirements, VPOXC addresses should 
        only be visible within that VPOXC and must not be leaked to 
        other VPOXCs (OVPNs).
