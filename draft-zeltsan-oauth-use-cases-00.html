Introduction</h3>

<p>The need for documenting the OAuth use cases was discussed at the oauth WG virtual meetings, on
the group's mailing list, and at the IETF 77 and IETF 78. This Internet-Draft describes such use cases. 
The objective of the draft is to initiate discussion that will lead to defining a set of the use cases 
that the OAuth specifications should support.

The following section provides the abbreviated descriptions of the use cases.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Web server</h3>

<p>
<br />

Description: <br />
<br />

Alice accesses an application running on a web server at www.printphotos.example.com and instructs it to print 
her photographs that are stored on a server www.storephotos.example.com. The application at www.printphotos.example.com 
receives Alice's authorization for accessing her photographs without learning her authentication credentials 
with www.storephotos.example.com.

</p>
<p>Pre-conditions:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Alice has registered with www.storephotos.example.com to enable authentication

</li>
<li>The application at www.printphotos.example.com has established authentication credentials with the application 
at www.storephotos.example.com	

</li>
</ul><p>

</p>
<p>Post-conditions:
<br />
<br />

A successful procedure results in the application www.printphotos.example.com receiving an authorization code from 
www.storephotos.example.com. The code is bound to the application at www.printphotos.example.com and to the callback 
URL supplied by the application. The application at www.printphotos.example.com uses the authorization code for 
obtaining an access token from www.storephotos.example.com. The application at www.storephotos.example.com issues 
an access token after authenticating the application at www.printphotos.example.com and validating the authorization 
code that it has submitted. The application at www.printphotos.example.com uses the access token for getting access 
to Alice's photographs at www.storephotos.example.com.
<br />
<br />

Note: When an access token expires, the service at www.printphotos.example.com needs to repeat the OAuth procedure 
for getting Alice's authorization to access her photographs at www.storephotos.example.com. Alternatively, if 
Alice wants to grant the application a long lasting access to her resources at www.storephotos.example.com, 
the authorization server associated with www.storephotos.example.com may issue the long-living tokens. 
Those tokens can be exchanged for short-living access tokens required to access www.storephotos.example.com.

</p>
<p>Requirements:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The server www.printphotos.example.com, which hosts an OAuth client, must be capable of issuing the HTTP redirect 
requests to Alice's user agent - a browser

</li>
<li>Application at www.storephotos.example.com must be able to authenticate Alice. The authentication method is not in the 
OAuth scope 

</li>
<li>Application at www.storephotos.example.com must obtain Alice's authorization of the access to her photos by 
www.printphotos.example.com

</li>
<li>Application at www.storephotos.example.com may identify to Alice the scope of access that www.printphotos.example.com 
has requested while asking for Alice's authorization

</li>
<li>Application at www.storephotos.example.com must be able to authenticate the application at www.printphotos.example.com 
and validate the authorization code before issuing an access token

</li>
<li>Application at www.printphotos.example.com must provide a callback URL to the application at www.storephotos.example.com 
(note: the URL can be pre-registered with www.storephotos.example.com)

</li>
<li>Application at www.storephotos.example.com is required to maintain a record that associates the authorization code 
with the application at www.printphotos.example.com and the callback URL provided by the application 

</li>
<li>Access tokens are bearer's tokens (they are not associated with a specific application, such as 
www.printphotos.example.com) and should have a short lifespan

</li>
<li>Application at www.storephotos.example.com must invalidate the authorization code after its first use

</li>
<li>Alice's manual involvement in the OAuth authorization procedure (e.g., entering an URL or a password) should not be 
required. (Alice's authentication to www.storephotos.example.com is not in the OAuth scope)

</li>
</ul><p>

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
User-agent</h3>

<p>

<br />

Description: <br />
<br />

Alice has installed on her computer a gaming application. She keeps her scores in a database 
of a social site at www.fun.example.com. In order to upload Alice's scores, the application 
gets access to the database with her authorization.

</p>
<p>Pre-conditions:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Alice has installed a gaming application implemented in a scripting language (e.g., 
JavaScript) that runs in her browser and uses OAuth for accessing a social site at 
www.fun.example.com

</li>
<li> There is no a web site supporting this application and capable of handling the OAuth flow

</li>
<li>
The installed application is registered with the social site at www.fun.example.com and 
has an identifier

</li>
<li>Alice has registered with www.fun.example.com for identification and authentication

</li>
<li> An auxiliary web server at www.help.example.com is reachable by Alice's browser and 
capable of providing a script that extracts an access token from an URL's fragment 

</li>
</ul><p>

</p>
<p>Post-conditions:

<br />
<br />

A successful procedure results in Alice's browser receiving an access token. The access token 
is received from www.fun.example.com as a fragment of a redirection URL of an auxiliary 
web server www.help.example.com. Alice's browser follows the redirection, but retains the 
fragment. From the auxiliary web server at www.help.example.com Alice's browser downloads 
a script that extracts access token from the fragment and makes it available to the gaming 
application. The application uses the access token to gain access to Alice's data 
at www.fun.example.com.

</p>
<p>Requirements:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
Registration of the application running in the Alice's browser with the application running 
on www.fun.example.com is required for identification

</li>
<li> Alice's authentication with www.fun.example.com is required

</li>
<li> Application running at www.fun.example.com must be able to describe to Alice the request made by 
the gaming application running on her computer and obtain Alice's authorization for or denial of the 
requested access

</li>
<li> After obtaining Alice's authorization the application running at www.fun.example.com must respond with 
an access token and redirect Alice's browser to a web server (e.g., www.help.example.com) that is  capable 
of retrieving an access token from an URL

</li>

<a name="rfc.section.3.3"></a><h3>3.3.&nbsp;
Mobile App</h3>

<p>
<br />

Description: <br />
<br />

Alice wants to upload (or download) her photographs to (or from) storephotos.example.com using her smartphone. 
She downloads and installs a photo app on her smartphone. In order to enable the app to access her photographs, 
Alice needs to authorize the app to access the web site on her behalf. The authorization shall be valid for a prolonged 
duration (e.g. several months), so that Alice does not need to authenticate and authorize access on every 
execution of the app. It shall be possible to withdraw the app's authorization both on the smartphone as 
well as on the site storephotos.example.com.  

</p>
<p>Pre-conditions:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Alice has installed a (native) photo app application on her smartphone

</li>
<li> The installed application is registered with the social site at storephotos.example.com and has an identifier 

</li>
<li> Alice holds an account with storephotos.example.com

</li>
<li> Authentication and authorization shall be performed in a interactive, browser-based process

</li>
</ul><p>

</p>
<p>Post-conditions:
<br />
<br />

A successful procedure results in Alice's app receiving an access and a refresh token. The app may obtain the tokens 
by utilizing either the web server or the user agent flow. The application uses the access token to gain access to 
Alice's data at storephotos.example.com. The refresh token is persistently stored on the device for use in 
sub-sequent app executions. If a refresh token exists on app startup, the app directly uses the refresh token to 
obtain a new access token.    

</p>
<p>Requirements:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Alice's authentication with www.fun.example.com is required

</li>
<li> Registration of the application running on Alice's smartphone is required for identification and registration and 
may be carried out on a per installation base

</li>
<li> The application at storephotos.example.com provides a capability to view and delete the apps' authorizations. This
implies that the different installations of the same app on the different devices can be distinguished 
(e.g., by a device name or a telephone number)

</li>
<li> The app must provide Alice an option to logout. The logout must result in the revocation of the refresh token 
on the authorization server

</li>
<li>

</li>

Device</h3>

<p>
<br />

Description: <br />
<br />

Alice has a device, such as a game console, that does not support an easy data-entry method. She also has 
an access to a computer with a browser. The application running on the Alice's 
device gets authorized access to a protected resource (e.g., photographs) stored on a server at www.storephotos.example.com.

</p>
<p>Pre-conditions:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Alice uses an Oauth-enabled game console, which does not have an easy data-entry method, for accessing 
her photographs at www.storephotos.example.com. The token issuance process is initiated at the device.

</li>
<li>Alice is able to connect to www.storephotos.example.com using a separate device providing an easy data-entry method 
(e.g., computer), which is equipped with a browser. This device is used to authorize access by the application running
