Abstract

   With	the increased growth of	the Internet, the number of customers
   using BGP4 has grown	significantly. RFC1930 outlines	a set of guide-
   lines for when one needs and	should use an AS. However, the customer
   and service provider	(ISP) are left with a problem as a result of
   this	in that	while there is no need for an allocated	AS under the
   guidelines, certain conditions make the use of BGP4 a very pragmatic
   and perhaps only way	to connect a customer homed to a single	ISP.
   This	paper proposes a solution to this problem in line with recommen-
   dations set forth in	RFC1930.

INTERNET-DRAFT		  Using	a Dedicated AS		   February 1997


1.  Problems

   With	the increased growth of	the Internet, the number of customers
   using BGP4 [1],[2] has grown	significantly. RFC1930 [4] outlines a
   set of guidelines for when one needs	and should use an AS. However,
   the customer	and service provider (ISP) are left with a problem as a
   result of this in that while	there is no need for an	allocated AS
   under the guidelines, certain conditions make the use of BGP4 a very
   pragmatic and perhaps only way to connect a customer	homed to a sin-
   gle ISP. These conditions are as follows:

   1) Customers	multi-homed to single provider

      Consider the scenario outlined in	Figure 1 below.

	  Figure 1: Customers multi-home to a single provider

      Here both	customer X and customer	Y are multi-homed to a single
      provider,	ISP A. Because these multiple connections are "local-
      ized" between the	ISP A and its customers, the rest of the routing
      system (ISP B and	ISP C in this case) doesn't need to see	routing
      information for a	single multi-homed customer any	differently than
      a	singly-homed customer as it has	the same routing policy	as ISP A
      relative to ISP B	and ISP	C.  In other words, with respect to the
      rest of the Internet routing system the organization is singly-
      homed, so	the complexity of the multiple connections is not rele-
      vant in a	global sense.  Autonomous System Numbers (AS) are iden-
      tifiers used in routing protocols	and are	needed by routing
      domains as part of the global routing system.  However, as [4]
      correctly	outlines, organizations	with the same routing policy as
      their upstream provider do not need an AS.

      Despite this fact, a problem exists in that many ISPs can	only
      support the load-sharing and reliability requirements of a multi-
      homed customer if	that customer exchanges	routing	information

      using BGP-4 which	does require an	AS as part of the protocol.

   2) Singly-homed customers requiring dynamic advertisement of	NLRI's

      While this is not	a common case as static	routing	is generally
      used for this purpose, if	a large	amount of NLRI's need to be
      advertised from the customer to the ISP it is often administra-
      tively easier for	these prefixes to be advertised	using a	dynamic
      routing protocol.	Today, the only	exterior gateway protocol (EGP)
      that is able to do this is BGP. This leads to the	same problem
      outlined in condition 1 above.

   As can be seen there	is clearly a problem with the recommendations
   set forth in	[4] and	the practice of	using BGP4 in the scenarios
   above. Section 2 proposes a solution	to this	problem	with following
   sections describing the implications	and application	of the proposed
   solution.

   It should also be noted that	if a customer is multi-homed to	more
   than	one ISP	then they are advised to obtain	an official allocated AS
   from	their allocation registry.


2.  Solution

   The solution	we are proposing is that all BGP customers homed to the
   same	single ISP use a single, dedicated AS specified	by the ISP.

   Logically, this solution results in an ISP having many peers	with the
   same	AS, although that AS exists in "islands" completely disconnected
   from	one another.

   Several practical implications of this solution are discussed in the
   next	section.

3. Implications

3.1 Full Routing Table Announcement

   The solution	precludes the ability for a BGP	customer using the dedi-
   cated AS to receive 100% full routes.  Because of routing loop detec-
   tion	of AS path, a BGP speaker rejects routes with its own AS number
   in the AS path.  Imagine Customer X and Customer Y maintain BGP peers
   with	Provider A using AS number N. Then, Customer X will not	be able
   to received routes of Customer Y.  We do not	believe	that this would
   cause a problem for Customer	X, though, because Customer X and Cus-
   tomer Y are both stub networks so default routing is	adequate, and
   the absence of a very small portion of the full routing table is

   unlikely to have a noticeable impact	on traffic patterns guided by
   MEDs	received.

   A BGP customer using	the dedicated AS must carry a default route
   (preferably receiving from its provider via BGP).


3.2  Change of External	Connectivity

   The dedicated AS specified by a provider is purely for use in peering
   between its customers and the provider. When	a customer using the
   dedicated AS	changes	its external connectivity, it may be necessary
   for the customer to reconfigure their network to use	a different AS
   number (either a globally unique one	if homed to multiple providers,
   or a	dedicated AS of	a different provider).


3.3  Aggregation

   As BGP customers using this dedicated AS are	only homed to one ISP,
   their routes	allocated from its providers CIDR block	do not need to
   be announced	upstream by its	provider as the	providers will already
   be originating the larger block. [6].


3.4  Routing Registries

   The Internet	Routing	Registry (IRR) [5] is used by providers	to gen-
   erate route filtering lists.	 Such lists are	derived	primarily from
   the "origin"	attribute of the route objects.	 The "origin" is the AS
   that	originates the route.  With multiple customers using the same
   AS, finer granularity will be necessary to generate the correct route
   filtering.  For example, the	"mntner" attribute or the "community"
   attribute of	a route	object can be used along with the "origin"
   attribute in	generating the filtering lists.


4. Practice

   The AS number specified by a	provider can either be an AS from the
   private AS space (64512 - 65535) [4], or be an AS previously	allo-
   cated to the	provider.  With	the former, the	dedicated AS like all
   other private AS's should be	stripped from its AS path while	the
   route is being propagated to	the rest of the	Internet routing system.
