1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Extension Headers (EHs) allow for the extension of the IPv6
   protocol, and provide support for core functionality such as IPv6
   fragmentation.  However, common implementation limitations suggest
   that EHs present a challenge for IPv6 packet routing equipment,
   particularly when the IPv6 header chain needs to be processed for
   e.g. enforcing ACLs or implementing other functions
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops].

Internet-Draft     Filtering of IPv6 packets with EHs          June 2021


   Recent studies (see e.g.  [RFC7872]) suggest that there is widespread
   dropping of IPv6 packets that contain IPv6 Extension Headers (EHs).
   In some cases, such packet drops occur at transit routers.  While
   some operators "officially" drop packets that contain IPv6 EHs, it is
   possible that some of the measured packet drops be the result of
   improper configuration defaults, or inappropriate advice in this
   area.

   This document analyzes both the general security implications of IPv6
   EHs, as well as the security implications of specific EH and Option
   types.  It also provides advice on the filtering of IPv6 packets
   based on the IPv6 EHs and the IPv6 options they contain.  Since
   various protocols may use IPv6 EHs (possibly with IPv6 options),
   discarding packets based on the IPv6 EHs or IPv6 options they contain
   can have implications on the proper functioning of such protocols.
   Thus, this document also attempts to discuss the operational and
   interoperability implications of such filtering policies.

   The resulting packet filtering policy typically depends on where in
   the network such policy is enforced: when the policy is enforced in a
   transit network, the policy typically follows a "deny-list" approach,
   where only packets with clear negative implications are dropped.  On
   the other hand, when the policy is enforced closer to the destination
   systems, the policy typically follows an "accept-list" approach,
   where only traffic that is expected to be received is allowed.  The
   advice in this document is aimed only at transit routers that may
   need to enforce a filtering policy based on the EHs and IPv6 options
   a packet may contain, following a "deny-list" approach, and hence is
   likely to be much more permissive that a filtering policy to be
   employed at e.g. the edge of an enterprise network.  The advice in
   this document is meant to improve the current situation of the
   dropping of packets with IPv6 EHs in the Internet [RFC7872] in such
   cases where packets are being dropped due to inappropriate or missing
   guidelines.

   This document is similar in nature to [RFC7126], which addresses the
   same problem for the IPv4 case.  However, in IPv6, the problem space
   is compounded by the fact that IPv6 specifies a number of IPv6 EHs,
   and a number of IPv6 options which may be valid only when included in
   specific EH types.

   This document completes and complements the considerations for
   protecting the control plane from packets containing IP options that
   can be found in [RFC6192].

   Section 2 of this document specifies the terminology and conventions
   employed throughout this document.  Section 3 of this document
   discusses IPv6 EHs and provides advice in the area of filtering IPv6

   packets that contain such IPv6 EHs.  Section 4 of this document
   discusses IPv6 options and provides advice in the area of filtering
   IPv6 packets that contain such options.

2.  Terminology and Conventions Used in This Document

2.1.  Terminology

   The terms "permit" (allow the traffic), "drop" (drop with no
   notification to sender), and "reject" (drop with appropriate
   notification to sender) are employed as defined in [RFC3871].
   Throughout this document we also employ the term "discard" as a
   generic term to indicate the act of discarding a packet, irrespective
   of whether the sender is notified of such drops, and irrespective of
   whether the specific filtering action is logged.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.2.  Applicability Statement

   This document provides advice on the filtering of IPv6 packets with
   EHs at transit routers for traffic *not* explicitly destined to them,
   for cases in which such filtering is deemed as necessary.

2.3.  Conventions

   This document assumes that nodes comply with the requirements in
   [RFC7045].  Namely,

   o  If a forwarding node discards a packet containing a standard IPv6
      EH, it MUST be the result of a configurable policy and not just
      the result of a failure to recognize such a header.

   o  The discard policy for each standard type of EH MUST be
      individually configurable.

   o  The default configuration should allow all standard IPv6 EHs.

   The advice provided in this document is only meant to guide an
   operator in configuring forwarding devices, and is *not* to be
   interpreted as advice regarding default configuration settings for
   network devices.  That is, this document provides advice with respect
   to operational configurations, but does not change the implementation
   defaults required by [RFC7045].

Internet-Draft     Filtering of IPv6 packets with EHs          June 2021


   We recommend that configuration options are made available to govern
   the processing of each IPv6 EH type and each IPv6 option type.  Such
   configuration options should include the following possible settings:

   o  Permit this IPv6 EH or IPv6 Option type.

   o  Discard (and log) packets containing this IPv6 EH or option type.

   o  Reject (and log) packets containing this IPv6 EH or option type
      (where the packet drop is signaled with an ICMPv6 error message).

   o  Rate-limit traffic containing this IPv6 EH or option type.

   o  Ignore this IPv6 EH or option type (as if it was not present) and
      forward the packet.  We note that if a packet carries forwarding
      information (e.g., in an IPv6 Routing Header) this might be an
      inappropriate or undesirable action.

   We note that special care needs to be taken when devices log packet
   drops/rejects.  Devices should count the number of packets dropped/
   rejected, but the logging of drop/reject events should be limited so
   as to not overburden device resources.

   Finally, we note that when discarding packets, it is generally
   desirable that the sender be signaled of the packet drop, since this
   is of use for trouble-shooting purposes.  However, throughout this
   document (when recommending that packets be discarded) we generically
   refer to the action as "discard" without specifying whether the
   sender is signaled of the packet drop.

3.  IPv6 Extension Headers

3.1.  General Discussion

   IPv6 [RFC8200] EHs allow for the extension of the IPv6 protocol.
   Since both IPv6 EHs and upper-layer protocols share the same
   namespace ("Next Header" registry/namespace), [RFC7045] identifies
   which of the currently assigned Internet Protocol numbers identify
   IPv6 EHs vs. upper-layer protocols.  This document discusses the
   filtering of packets based on the IPv6 EHs (as specified by
   [RFC7045]) they contain.

      NOTE: [RFC8200] specifies that non-fragmented IPv6 datagrams and
      IPv6 First-Fragments must contain the entire IPv6 header chain
      [RFC7112].  Therefore, intermediate systems can enforce the
      filtering policies discussed in this document, or resort to simply
      discarding the offending packets when they fail to comply with the
      requirements in [RFC8200].  We note that, in order to implement

      filtering rules on the fast path, it may be necessary for the
      filtering device to limit the depth into the packet that can be
      inspected before giving up.  In circumstances where such a
      limitation exists, it is recommended that implementations provide
      a configuration option that specifies whether to discard packets
      if the aforementioned limit is encountered.  Operators may then
      determine according to their own circumstances how such packets
      will be handled.

3.2.  General Security Implications

   In some device architectures, IPv6 packets that contain IPv6 EHs can
   cause the corresponding packets to be processed on the slow path, and
   hence may be leveraged for the purpose of Denial of Service (DoS)
   attacks [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops] [Cisco-EH]
   [FW-Benchmark].

   Operators are urged to consider the IPv6 EH and IPv6 options handling
   capabilities of their devices as they make deployment decisions in
   future.

3.3.  Summary of Advice on the Handling of IPv6 Packets with Specific
      IPv6 Extension Headers

   This section summarizes the advice provided in Section 3.4, providing
   references to the specific sections in which a detailed analysis can

      Extension Headers

3.4.1.  IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options (Protocol Number=0)

3.4.1.1.  Uses

   The Hop-by-Hop Options header is used to carry optional information
   that may be examined by every node along a packet's delivery path.

   It is expected that nodes will examine the Hop-by-Hop Options header
   if explicitly configured to do so.

   NOTE: A previous revision of the IPv6 core specification, [RFC2460],
   originally required that all nodes examined and processed the Hop-by-
   Hop Options header.  However, even before the publication of
   [RFC8200] a number of implementations already provided the option of
   ignoring this header unless explicitly configured to examine it.

3.4.1.2.  Specification

   This EH is specified in [RFC8200].  At the time of this writing, the
   following options have been specified for the Hop-by-Hop Options EH:

   o  Type 0x00: Pad1 [RFC8200]

   o  Type 0x01: PadN [RFC8200]

   o  Type 0x05: Router Alert [RFC2711]

   o  Type 0x07: CALIPSO [RFC5570]

   o  Type 0x08: SMF_DPD [RFC6621]

   o  Type 0x23: RPL Option [RFC9008]

   o  Type 0x26: Quick-Start [RFC4782]

   o  Type 0x4D: (Deprecated)

   o  Type 0x63: RPL Option [RFC6553]

   o  Type 0x6D: MPL Option [RFC7731]

   o  Type 0x8A: Endpoint Identification (Deprecated)

   o  Type 0xDE: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

   o  Type 0xFE: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

3.4.1.3.  Specific Security Implications

   Legacy nodes that process this extension header might be subject to
   Denial of Service attacks.

   NOTE: While [RFC8200] has removed this requirement, the deployed base
   may still reflect the traditional behavior for a while, and hence the
   potential security problems of this EH are still of concern.

3.4.1.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets containing a Hop-by-Hop Options EH would break any
   of the protocols that rely on it for proper functioning.  For
   example, it would break RSVP [RFC2205] and multicast deployments, and
   would cause IPv6 jumbograms to be discarded.

3.4.1.5.  Advice

   Nodes implementing [RFC8200] would already ignore this extension
   header unless explicitly required to process it.  For legacy
   ([RFC2460]) nodes, the recommended configuration for the processing
   of these packets depends on the features and capabilities of the
   underlying platform, the configuration of the platform, and also the
   deployment environment of the platform.  On platforms that allow
   forwarding of packets with HBH Options on the fast path, we recommend
   that packets with a HBH Options EH be forwarded as normal.
   Otherwise, on platforms in which processing of packets with a IPv6
   HBH Options EH is carried out in the slow path, and an option is
   provided to rate-limit these packets, we recommend that this option
   be selected.  Finally, when packets containing a HBH Options EH are
   processed in the slow-path, and the underlying platform does not have
   any mitigation options available for attacks based on these packets,
   we recommend that such platforms discard packets containing IPv6 HBH
   Options EHs.

   Finally, we note that, for obvious reasons, RPL (Routing Protocol for
   Low-Power and Lossy Networks) [RFC6550] routers must not discard
   packets based on the presence of an IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options EH.

3.4.2.  Routing Header for IPv6 (Protocol Number=43)

3.4.2.1.  Uses

   The Routing header is used by an IPv6 source to list one or more
   intermediate nodes to be "visited" on the way to a packet's
   destination.

3.4.2.2.  Specification

   This EH is specified in [RFC8200].  [RFC2460] had originally
   specified the Routing Header Type 0, which was later obsoleted by
   [RFC5095], and thus removed from [RFC8200].

   At the time of this writing, the following Routing Types have been
   specified:

   o  Type 0: Source Route (DEPRECATED) [RFC2460] [RFC5095]

   o  Type 1: Nimrod (DEPRECATED)

   o  Type 2: Type 2 Routing Header [RFC6275]

   o  Type 3: RPL Source Route Header [RFC6554]

   o  Type 4: Segment Routing Header (SRH) [RFC8754]

   o  Types 5-252: Unassigned

   o  Type 253: RFC3692-style Experiment 1 [RFC4727]

   o  Type 254: RFC3692-style Experiment 2 [RFC4727]

   o  Type 255: Reserved

3.4.2.3.  Specific Security Implications

   The security implications of RHT0 have been discussed in detail in
   [Biondi2007] and [RFC5095].  The security implications of RHT4 (SRH)
   are discussed in [RFC8754].

3.4.2.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Blocking packets containing a RHT0 or RHT1 has no operational
   implications, since both have been deprecated.  Blocking packets with
   a RHT4 (SRH) will break Segment Routing (SR) deployments, if the
   filtering policy is enforced on packets being forwarded within an SR
   domain.

3.4.2.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should discard packets containing a RHT0 or
   RHT1.  Other routing header types should be permitted, as required by
   [RFC7045].

3.4.3.  Fragment Header for IPv6 (Protocol Number=44)

3.4.3.1.  Uses

   This EH provides the fragmentation functionality for IPv6.

3.4.3.2.  Specification

   This EH is specified in [RFC8200].

3.4.3.3.  Specific Security Implications

   The security implications of the Fragment Header range from Denial of
   Service attacks (e.g. based on flooding a target with IPv6 fragments)
   to information leakage attacks [RFC7739].

3.4.3.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Blocking packets that contain a Fragment Header will break any
   protocol that may rely on fragmentation (e.g., the DNS [RFC1034]).
   However, IP fragmentation is known to introduce fragility to Internet
   communication [RFC8900].

3.4.6.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets that contain a Destination Options header would
   break protocols that rely on this EH type for conveying information,
   including protocols such as ILNP [RFC6740] and Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275],
   and IPv6 tunnels that employ the Tunnel Encapsulation Limit option.

3.4.6.5.  Advice

3.4.8.3.  Specific Security Implications

   The security implications of the HIP header are discussed in detail
   in Section 8 of [RFC6275].

3.4.8.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets that contain the Host Identity Protocol would

3.4.10.  Use for experimentation and testing (Protocol Numbers=253 and
         254)

3.4.10.1.  Uses

   These IPv6 EHs are employed for performing RFC3692-Style experiments
   (see [RFC3692] for details).

3.4.10.2.  Specification

   These EHs are specified in [RFC3692] and [RFC4727].

3.4.10.3.  Specific Security Implications

   The security implications of these EHs will depend on their specific
   use.

3.4.10.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   For obvious reasons, discarding packets that contain these EHs limits
   the ability to perform legitimate experiments across IPv6 routers.

3.4.10.5.  Advice

   Operators should determine according to their own circumstances
   whether to discard packets containing these EHs.

3.5.  Advice on the Handling of Packets with Unknown IPv6 Extension
      Headers

   We refer to IPv6 EHs that have not been assigned an Internet Protocol
   Number by IANA (and marked as such) in [IANA-PROTOCOLS] as "unknown
   IPv6 extension headers" ("unknown IPv6 EHs").

3.5.1.  Uses

   New IPv6 EHs may be specified as part of future extensions to the
   IPv6 protocol.

   Since IPv6 EHs and Upper-layer protocols employ the same namespace,
   it is impossible to tell whether an unknown "Internet Protocol
   Number" is being employed for an IPv6 EH or an Upper-Layer protocol.

3.5.2.  Specification

   The processing of unknown IPv6 EHs is specified in [RFC7045].

3.5.3.  Specific Security Implications

   For obvious reasons, it is impossible to determine specific security
   implications of unknown IPv6 EHs.

3.5.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   As noted in [RFC7045], discarding unknown IPv6 EHs may slow down the
   deployment of new IPv6 EHs and transport protocols.  The
   corresponding IANA registry ([IANA-PROTOCOLS]) should be monitored
   such that filtering rules are updated as new IPv6 EHs are
   standardized.

   We note that since IPv6 EHs and upper-layer protocols share the same
   numbering space, discarding unknown IPv6 EHs may result in packets
   encapsulating unknown upper-layer protocols being discarded.

3.5.5.  Advice

   Operators should determine according to their own circumstances
   whether to discard packets containing unknown IPv6 EHs.

4.  IPv6 Options

4.1.  General Discussion

   The following subsections describe specific security implications of
   different IPv6 options, and provide advice regarding filtering
   packets that contain such options.

4.2.  General Security Implications of IPv6 Options

   The general security implications of IPv6 options are closely related
   to those discussed in Section 3.2 for IPv6 EHs.  Essentially, packets
   that contain IPv6 options might need to be processed by an IPv6
   router's general-purpose CPU,and hence could present a DDoS risk to
   that router's general-purpose CPU (and thus to the router itself).
   For some architectures, a possible mitigation would be to rate-limit
   the packets that are to be processed by the general-purpose CPU (see
   e.g.  [Cisco-EH]).

4.3.  Advice on the Handling of Packets with Specific IPv6 Options

   options that have so far been specified, a summary of the security
   implications of each of such options, a discussion of possible

   discarded, and specific advice regarding whether packets containing
   these options should be permitted.

4.3.1.  Pad1 (Type=0x00)

4.3.1.1.  Uses

   This option is used when necessary to align subsequent options and to
   pad out the containing header to a multiple of 8 octets in length.

4.3.1.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC8200].

4.3.1.3.  Specific Security Implications

   None.

4.3.1.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets that contain this option would potentially break
   any protocol that relies on IPv6 options.

4.3.1.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should not discard packets based on the presence

   There are no specific issues arising from this option, except for
   improper validity checks of the option and associated packet lengths.

4.3.3.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets based on the presence of this option will cause

4.3.4.3.  Specific Security Implications

   Those described in [RFC6553].

4.3.4.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   This option is meant to be employed within an RPL instance.  As a
   result, discarding packets based on the presence of this option (e.g.
   at an ISP) will not result in interoperability implications.

4.3.7.1.  Uses

   The Router Alert option [RFC2711] is employed by a number of
   protocols, including the Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP)
   [RFC2205], Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) [RFC2710] [RFC3810],
   Multicast Router Discovery (MRD) [RFC4286], and General Internet
   Signaling Transport (GIST) [RFC5971].  Its usage is discussed in
   detail in [RFC6398].

4.3.7.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC2711].

4.3.7.3.  Specific Security Implications

   Since this option causes the contents of the packet to be inspected
   by the handling device, this option could be leveraged for performing
   DoS attacks.  The security implications of the Router Alert option
   are discussed in detail in [RFC6398].

4.3.7.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets that contain this option would break any protocols
   that rely on them, such as RSVP and multicast deployments.  Please
   see Section 4.3.7.3 for further details.

4.3.7.5.  Advice

   Packets containing this option should be permitted in environments
   where support for RSVP, multicast routing, or similar protocols is
   desired.

4.3.8.  Quick-Start (Type=0x26)

4.3.8.1.  Uses

   This IP Option is used in the specification of Quick-Start for TCP
   and IP, which is an experimental mechanism that allows transport
   protocols, in cooperation with routers, to determine an allowed
   sending rate at the start and, at times, in the middle of a data
   transfer (e.g., after an idle period) [RFC4782].

4.3.8.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC4782], on the "Experimental" track.

4.3.8.3.  Specific Security Implications

   Section 9.6 of [RFC4782] notes that Quick-Start is vulnerable to two
   kinds of attacks:

   o  attacks to increase the routers' processing and state load, and,

   o  attacks with bogus Quick-Start Requests to temporarily tie up
      available Quick-Start bandwidth, preventing routers from approving
      Quick-Start Requests from other connections.

   We note that if routers in a given environment do not implement and
   enable the Quick-Start mechanism, only the general security
   implications of IP options (discussed in Section 4.2) would apply.

4.3.8.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   The Quick-Start functionality would be disabled, and additional
   delays in TCP's connection establishment (for example) could be
   introduced.  (Please see Section 4.7.2 of [RFC4782].)  We note,
   however, that Quick-Start has been proposed as a mechanism that could
   be of use in controlled environments, and not as a mechanism that

   would be intended or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment in the
   global Internet [RFC4782].

4.3.8.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should not discard IPv6 packets based on the
   presence of this option.

4.3.9.  CALIPSO (Type=0x07)

4.3.9.1.  Uses

   This option is used for encoding explicit packet Sensitivity Labels
   on IPv6 packets.  It is intended for use only within Multi-Level
   Secure (MLS) networking environments that are both trusted and
   trustworthy.

4.3.9.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC5570].

4.3.9.3.  Specific Security Implications

   Presence of this option in a packet does not by itself create any
   specific new threat.  Packets with this option ought not normally be
   seen on the global public Internet.

4.3.9.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   If packets with this option are discarded or if the option is
   stripped from the packet during transmission from source to
   destination, then the packet itself is likely to be discarded by the
   receiver because it is not properly labeled.  In some cases, the
   receiver might receive the packet but associate an incorrect
   sensitivity label with the received data from the packet whose
   CALIPSO was stripped by an intermediate router or firewall.
   Associating an incorrect sensitivity label can cause the received
   information either to be handled as more sensitive than it really is
   ("upgrading") or as less sensitive than it really is ("downgrading"),
   either of which is problematic.

4.3.9.5.  Advice

   Recommendations for handling the CALIPSO option depend on the
   deployment environment, rather than whether an intermediate system
   happens to be deployed as a transit device (e.g., IPv6 transit
   router).

   Explicit configuration is the only method via which an intermediate
   system can know whether or not that particular intermediate system
   has been deployed within a Multi-Level Secure (MLS) environment.  In
   many cases, ordinary commercial intermediate systems (e.g., IPv6
   routers and firewalls) are the majority of the deployed intermediate
   systems inside an MLS network environment.

   For Intermediate systems that DO NOT implement RFC-5570, there should
   be a configuration option to EITHER (a) drop packets containing the
   CALIPSO option OR (b) to ignore the presence of the CALIPSO option
   and forward the packets normally.  In non-MLS environments, such
   intermediate systems should have this configuration option set to (a)
   above.  In MLS environments, such intermediate systems should have
   this option set to (b) above.  The default setting for this
   configuration option should be set to (a) above, because MLS
   environments are much less common than non-MLS environments.

   For Intermediate systems that DO implement RFC-5570, there should be
   configuration options (a) and (b) from the preceding paragraph and
   also a third configuration option (c) to process packets containing a
   CALIPSO option as per RFC-5570.  When deployed in non-MLS
   environments, such intermediate systems should have this
   configuration option set to (a) above.  When deployed in MLS
   environments, such intermediate systems should have this set to (c).
   The default setting for this configuration option MAY be set to (a)
   above, because MLS environments are much less common than non-MLS
   environments.

4.3.10.  SMF_DPD (Type=0x08)

4.3.10.1.  Uses

   This option is employed in the (experimental) Simplified Multicast
   Forwarding (SMF) for unique packet identification for IPv6 I-DPD, and
   as a mechanism to guarantee non-collision of hash values for
   different packets when H-DPD is used.

4.3.10.2.  Specification

   Dropping packets containing this option within a MANET domain would
   break SMF.  However, dropping such packets at the border of such
   domain would have no negative impact.

   Intermediate systems should not discard IPv6 packets based on the
   presence of this option.

4.3.12.  Endpoint Identification (Type=0x8A)

4.3.12.1.  Uses

   The Endpoint Identification option was meant to be used with the
   Nimrod routing architecture [NIMROD-DOC], but has never seen
   widespread deployment.

Internet-Draft     Filtering of IPv6 packets with EHs          June 2021


4.3.12.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [NIMROD-DOC].

4.3.12.3.  Specific Security Implications

   Undetermined.

4.3.12.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   None.

4.3.12.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should discard packets that contain this option.

4.3.13.  ILNP Nonce (Type=0x8B)

4.3.13.1.  Uses

   This option is employed by Identifier-Locator Network Protocol for
   IPv6 (ILNPv6) for providing protection against off-path attacks for
   packets when ILNPv6 is in use, and as a signal during initial
   network-layer session creation that ILNPv6 is proposed for use with
   this network-layer session, rather than classic IPv6.

4.3.13.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC6744].

4.3.13.3.  Specific Security Implications

   Those described in [RFC6744].

4.3.13.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding packets that contain this option will break INLPv6
   deployments.

4.3.13.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should not discard packets based on the presence
   of this option.

4.3.14.  Line-Identification Option (Type=0x8C)

4.3.14.1.  Uses

   This option is used by an Edge Router to identify the subscriber
   premises in scenarios where several subscriber premises may be
   logically connected to the same interface of an Edge Router.

4.3.14.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC6788].

4.3.14.3.  Specific Security Implications

   Those described in [RFC6788].

4.3.14.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Since this option is meant to be employed in Router Solicitation
   messages, discarding packets based on the presence of this option at
   intermediate systems will result in no interoperability implications.

4.3.14.5.  Advice

   Intermediate devices should discard packets that contain this option.

4.3.15.  Deprecated (Type=0x4D)

4.3.15.1.  Uses

   No information has been found about this option type.

4.3.15.2.  Specification

   No information has been found about this option type.

4.3.15.3.  Specific Security Implications

   No information has been found about this option type, and hence it
   has been impossible to perform the corresponding security assessment.

4.3.15.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Unknown.

Internet-Draft     Filtering of IPv6 packets with EHs          June 2021


4.3.15.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should discard packets that contain this option.

4.3.16.  MPL Option (Type=0x6D)

4.3.16.1.  Uses

   This option is used with the Multicast Protocol for Low power and
   Lossy Networks (MPL), that provides IPv6 multicast forwarding in
   constrained networks.

4.3.16.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC7731], and is meant to be included
   only in Hop-by-Hop Option headers.

4.3.16.3.  Specific Security Implications

   Those described in [RFC7731].

4.3.16.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Dropping packets that contain an MPL option within an MPL network
   would break the Multicast Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks
   (MPL).  However, dropping such packets at the border of such networks
   will have no negative impact.

4.3.16.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems should not discard packets based on the presence
   of this option.  However, since this option has been specified for
   the Hop-by-Hop Options, such systems should consider the discussion
   in Section 3.4.1.

4.3.17.  IP_DFF (Type=0xEE)

4.3.17.1.  Uses

   This option is employed with the (Experimental) Depth-First
   Forwarding (DFF) in Unreliable Networks.

4.3.17.2.  Specification

   This option is specified in [RFC6971].

4.3.17.3.  Specific Security Implications

   Those specified in [RFC6971].

4.3.17.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Dropping packets containing this option within a routing domain that
   is running DFF would break DFF.  However, dropping such packets at
   the border of such domains will have no security implications.

4.3.17.5.  Advice

   Intermediate systems that do not operate within a routing domain that
   is running DFF should discard packets containing this option.

4.3.18.  RFC3692-style Experiment (Types = 0x1E, 0x3E, 0x5E, 0x7E, 0x9E,
         0xBE, 0xDE, 0xFE)

4.3.18.1.  Uses

   These options can be employed for performing RFC3692-style
   experiments.  It is only appropriate to use these values in
   explicitly configured experiments; they must not be shipped as
   defaults in implementations.

4.3.18.2.  Specification

   Specified in RFC 4727 [RFC4727] in the context of RFC3692-style
   experiments.

4.3.18.3.  Specific Security Implications

   The specific security implications will depend on the specific use of
   these options.

4.3.18.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   For obvious reasons, discarding packets that contain these options
   limits the ability to perform legitimate experiments across IPv6
   routers.

4.3.18.5.  Advice

   Operators should determine according to their own circumstances
   whether to discard packets containing these IPv6 options.

4.4.  Advice on the handling of Packets with Unknown IPv6 Options

   We refer to IPv6 options that have not been assigned an IPv6 option
   type in the corresponding registry ([IANA-IPV6-PARAM]) as "unknown
   IPv6 options".

4.4.1.  Uses

   New IPv6 options may be specified as part of future protocol work.

4.4.2.  Specification

   The processing of unknown IPv6 options is specified in [RFC8200].

4.4.3.  Specific Security Implications

   For obvious reasons, it is impossible to determine specific security
   implications of unknown IPv6 options.

4.4.4.  Operational and Interoperability Impact if Blocked

   Discarding unknown IPv6 options may slow down the deployment of new
   IPv6 options.  As noted in [draft-gont-6man-ipv6-opt-transmit], the
   corresponding IANA registry ([IANA-IPV6-PARAM] should be monitored
   such that IPv6 option filtering rules are updated as new IPv6 options
   are standardized.

4.4.5.  Advice

   Operators should determine according to their own circumstances
   whether to discard packets containing unknown IPv6 options.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   There are no privacy considerations associated with this document.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document provides advice on the filtering of IPv6 packets that
   contain IPv6 EHs (and possibly IPv6 options) at IPv6 transit routers.
   It is meant to improve the current situation of widespread dropping
   of such IPv6 packets in those cases where the drops result from
   improper configuration defaults, or inappropriate advice in this
   area.
