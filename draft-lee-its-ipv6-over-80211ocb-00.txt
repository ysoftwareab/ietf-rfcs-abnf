                draft-lee-its-ipv6-over-80211ocb-00.txt

Abstract

   This document describes the transmission of IPv6 packets over the
   IEEE 802.11p OCB mode.  In particular it sets the MTU parameter and
   describes two alternative frame formats.

1.  Introduction

   In the IEEE 802.11p OCB mode, all nodes in the wireless range can
   directly communicate with each other without authentication/
   association procedures, thus data exchange between nodes can be
   established in fractions of seconds.  The IEEE 802.11p OCB mode has
   the following properties:

   o  Wildcard BSSID (i.e., all bits are set to 1) used by each node

   o  No beacons transmitted

   o  No authentication required

   o  No association needed

   o  No encryption provided

   o  dot11OCBActivated OID set to true

   This document describes the transmission of IPv6 packets over the
   IEEE 802.11p OCB mode.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   OCB - Outside the Context of a BSS.

   802.11-OCB - IEEE 802.11-2012 text flagged by "dot11OCBActivated".
   This means: IEEE 802.11e for quality of service; 802.11j-2004 for
   half-clocked operations; and 802.11p for operation in the 5.9 GHz
   band and in mode OCB.

3.  Maximum Transmission Unit

   The default MTU size for IPv6 packets on an 802.11-OCB link is 1500
   octets.  This size may be reduced by a Router Advertisement
   containing an MTU option which specifies a smaller MTU, or by manual
   (or DHCPv6) configuration of each node.  If a Router Advertisement
   received on an 802.11-OCB interface has an MTU option specifying an
   MTU larger than 1500 octets, or larger than a manually configured
   value, that MTU option may be logged to system management but must be
   otherwise ignored.

   Non-IPv6 packets such as WAVE Short Message Protocol (WSMP) can be
   delivered on 802.11-OCB links.  Specifications of these packets are
   out of scope and do not impose any limit on the MTU size, allowing an
   arbitrary number of 'containers'.

4.  Frame Format

   IPv6 packets can be transmitted as "IEEE 802.11 Data" or
   alternatively as "IEEE 802.11 QoS Data".
