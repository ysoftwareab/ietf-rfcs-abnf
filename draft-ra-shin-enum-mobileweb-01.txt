Internet-Draft     Mobileweb Enumservice Registration          July 2005


2.  Introduction

   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [2]) is a system that transforms
   E.164 numbers [3] into domain names and then uses DNS (Domain Name
   Service, RFC 1034 [4]) services like delegation through NS records
   and NAPTR records to look up what services are available for a
   specific domain name.

   This document registers 'Enumservices' according to the guidelines
   given in RFC 3761 [2] to be used for provisioning in the services
   field of a NAPTR [5] resource record to indicate what class of
   functionality a given end point offers.  The registration is defined
   within the DDDS (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System [6] [7] [5] [8]
   [9] ) hierarchy, for use with the "E2U" DDDS Application, defined in
   RFC 3761 [2].

   This document registers the ENUMservice "mobileweb" using the URI
   schemes 'http:' and 'https:' as per the IANA registration process
   defined in the ENUM specification RFC 3761.

   The ITU (International Telecommunication Union) collates reports of
   world mobile usage.  The total number of mobile subscribers has
   reached more than 1.3 billion as of 2003, according to its
   statistics.

   As the market of mobile telephony service has kept growing, the
   number of mobile internet users has been gradually increasing.

   Mobile ENUM usage will be of high importance according to its
   convenience and portability; the number of mobile devices with
   Internet access that can take advantage of its convenience may well
   outweigh those with fixed connectivity.

   Mobile devices do have some special characteristics that lead to
   optimisation of content; they tend to have smaller screens, and at
   present their access bandwidth is relatively low whilst the latency
   over this access is relatively high.

   In particular, a number of schemes have been developed to provide
   web-based content that is optimised for these characteristics - these
   schemes can be described as providing "Mobile Webpages".

   Such Special purpose Mobile Webpages are smaller and simpler than web
   pages for general use; the Mobile Webpage is designed to fit within
   the pocket-sized display of mobile terminals, and to reflect the
   "long pipes" by which these terminals are connected.

   Mobile web services are being provided using different protocol

   architectures.  Currently there are three representative different
   protocol architectures for the mobile web service : WAP [10], ME [11]
   and i-mode [12].

   This document registers mobile web-service (mobileweb) as an
   ENUMservice with veriants to reflect these three protocols (WAP, ME
   and i-mode), together with "uniform" variants that indicate that the
   content is optimised for mobile use, but uses a standard protocol
   architecture.

3.  Current Status of Mobile Web Services

   A Mobile Webpage is a simplified form of general web page, designed
   to be displayed in the small screen of a Mobile Terminal.

   Currently, there are three representative protocol architectures used
   for a mobile terminal to access mobile web-pages.  These three
   protocols are WAP (Wireless Application Protocol)[9], ME (Mobile
   Explorer)[10] and i-mode[11].  These differ in the method they use
   for the mobile terminal to request and receive a mobile webpage, and
   the markup language in which the mobile webpage is presented.

   The following figures show brief specifications of the WAP, ME and
   i-mode protocol architectures:

   they are designed for mobile terminals that have such support.
   Conversely, "general purpose" web pages are often not displayed
   properly on mobile terminals.

   If mobile web-services use ENUMServices in accordance with RFC4002
   [13] ("IANA Registration for ENUMServices web and ft"), it is very
   hard for the mobile service provider, terminal and its user to
   distinguish optimised Mobile Webpages from "general use" webpages.
   Moreover, there is no way to discriminate the protocol architecture
   (WAP, ME or i-mode) used by the mobile web-service, and so that needs
   to be supported by the terminal.

   Consequently, the ENUMservice registration used by a mobile web-
   service must be classified according to the protocol architecture
   that web-service uses; it needs to use another Enumservice from those
   specified in RFC 4002.

4.  Mobile Web Service Registration

4.1  Introduction

   The Enumservice variants registered in this section indicate that the
   resource identified by the associated URI is capable of being a
   source of information through a mobile webpage.

   There are two choices of ENUMservices registration of mobile web-
   services.  These are 'Diverse Mobile Web Service Registration' and
   'Uniform Mobile Web Service Registration'.

   The 'Diverse Mobile Web Service Registration' variants use
   Enumservice Type 'mobileweb' and different Enumservice Subtypes
   according to the mobile protocol architecture (WAP, ME, i-mode)
   employed by mobile web-services.  So far, for those Enumservices that
   have both a type and subtype, the type reflected the kind of service
   provided, and the subtype reflected the URI scheme needed.

   However, this document specifies the protocol architecture used for
   the mobile web-service as the subtype because it is impossible to
   discern among the protocols of mobile web-service through specifying
   URI scheme as the subtype (for example, ME and i-mode both use the
   same URI scheme, http(s)).  As you can see in section 2.4.2.1 (ENUM
   Services) of RFC 3761, Enumservice specifications contain the
   functional specification, the valid protocols, and the URI schemes
   that may be returned.  There is no implicit mapping between the
   textual string "type" or "subtype" in the grammar for the Enumservice
   and URI schemes or protocols.  Accordingly, it is not wrong to
   specify the protocol architecture of mobile web-service as the
   subtype.  If there is a mobile web-site, and that mobile web-service
   is provided using different URIs depending on the protocol
   architectures used by the mobile web-service, then that mobile web-
   service provider uses the appropriate 'Diverse Mobile Web Service
   Registration' variant.

   On the other hand, the 'Uniform Mobile Web Service Registration' uses
   Enumservice Type 'mobileweb' but does not use any Enumservice
   Subtypes.  If there is one mobile web-site, and the mobile web-
   service is provided using a same URI regardless of the protocols of
   mobile web-service (namely, if mobile web-server is intelligent and
   able to branch the connection to the proper web-page according to the
   supported protocol of mobile web-service), then the mobile web-
   service provider uses the 'Uniform Mobile Web Service Registration'
   variant

   Besides, in accordance with the trend that the protocols of mobile
   web-service are being unified and converged, this document proposes

   that the unified and converged mobile web-service be registered using
   'Uniform Mobile Web Service Registration'.

4.2  Diverse Mobile Web Service Registration with 'http:','https:'

      Enumservice Name: "mobileweb"

      Enumservice Type: "mobileweb"

      Enumservice Subtype: "wap", "me", "imode"

      URI Scheme: 'http:', 'https:'

      Functional Specification:

         This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
         associated URI scheme is capable of being a source of
         information through a mobile webpage, using the specified
         mobile protocol architecture.

      Security Considerations:

         There are no specific security issues with this 'Enumservice'.
         However, the general considerations of Section 7 apply.

5.  Considerations for the 'WAP' registration

   In 4.2, mobile web-service conforming to WAP protocol is registered
   with 'http(s)' URI scheme.  As you can see in the brief WAP
   specification above, for WAP 2.0, it is reasonable to use 'http(s)'
   URI scheme, whilst it might look unreasonable to use 'http(s)' URI
   scheme for WAP 1.x because WAP 1.x uses WSP/WTP for transport on
   terminal-side.  However, it is noted that the terminal has a function
   that transforms http(s) requests in the browser (application) level
   to WSP/WTP forms, and the WAP Gateway has a function that restores
   the WSP/WTP forms to the original http(s) requests again.  Therefore,
   the fact that a mobile web-service conforming to WAP is registered
   with 'http(s)' URI scheme doesn't raise any issues.  However, if a
   URI scheme (e.g wap, wsp, wtp, wsl and so on) for WAP is to be
   devised in the future, mobile web-service conforming to WAP could
   instead be registered with the new URI scheme.  This would require an
   update to this registration if that ever occurs.

6.  Expected Behaviour

   Browser (application) for mobile web-services and its user must know
   what protocol of mobile web-services is supported.  Only so, it is
   possible to register and connect to a web-service properly.

   After a ENUM resolution of a E.164 associated with mobile web-
   service, there are three likely results.

   In case that only URIs registered by 'Diverse Mobile Web Service
   Registration' are returned as the resolution result,
   browser(application) or its user selects the URI registered by a
   proper Enumservice Subtype(wap, me or imode) and tries making
   connection with the URI.  If there are several proper URIs,
   browser(application) or its user can select a URI, based on the value
   of Order and Preference field of NAPTR or the own rule.

   In case that only URIs registered by 'Uniform Mobile Web Service
   Registration' are returned as the resolution result,
   browser(application) or its user selects a URI, based on the value of
   Order and Preference field of NAPTR or the own rule.  If the mobile
   web-server connected is intelligent and has an appropriate branch
   web-page, browser(application) and its user can be provided with
   mobile web-service.  If the mobile web-server connected is
   intelligent and has no appropriate branch web-page,
   browser(application) and its user can not be provided with mobile
   web-service.  If mobile web-service uses only the unified and
   converged protocol, and browser(application) supports it,
   browser(application) and its user can be provided with the mobile
   web-service.  If mobile web-service uses only the unified and
   converged protocol, and browser(application) does not support it,
   browser(application) and its user can not be provided with the mobile
   web-service.

   In case that URIs registered by 'Diverse Mobile Web Service

7.  Security Considerations

   As used by ENUM, DNS is a global, distributed database.  Thus any
   information stored there is visible to anyone anonymously.  Although
   this is not qualitatively different from publication in a telephone
   directory, it does expose the data subject to having "their"
   information collected automatically without any indication that this
   has been done, or by whom.

   Data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate lists of
   targets for unrequested information; in short, it is used to address
   "spam".  Anyone who uses a Web-archived mailing list is aware that
   the volume of "spam" email they receive increases when they post to
   the mailing list; publication of a telephone number in ENUM is no
   different and may be used to send "junk faxes" or "junk SMS", for
   example.

   Many mailing list users have more than one email address and use
   "sacrificial" email accounts when they post to these lists to help
   filter out unrequested emails.  This is not so easy with published
   telephone numbers; the PSTN E.164 [12] number assignment process is
   much more involved, and usually a single E.164 number (or a fixed
   range of numbers) is associated with each PSTN access.  Thus,
   providing a "sacrificial" phone number in any publication is not
   possible.

   Due to the implications of publishing data on a globally accessible
   database, as a principle the data subject MUST give explicit informed
   consent when data is published in ENUM.

   In addition, the data subject should be made aware that, due to
   storage of such data during harvesting by third parties, removal of
   the data from publication will not remove any copies that have been
   taken; in effect, any publication may be permanent.

   However, regulations in many regions will require that the data
   subject can at any time request that the data is removed from
   publication, and that consent for its publication is explicitly
   confirmed at regular intervals.

   The user SHOULD be asked to confirm opening a mobile webpage because
   it could impose a charge on the user.

   Using 'http' URI scheme to connect with a mobile webpage is not
   secure, so the user should apply the same caution when entering
   personal data as they would do if using a client application started
   with any other method.  Although this is not a feature of ENUM or
   these Enumservices, the ENUM-using application on the end system may

Internet-Draft     Mobileweb Enumservice Registration          July 2005


   appear different from the user's "normal" browser, so the user SHOULD
   receive an indication of whether their communication is secured.

   As evaluating a mobile web page can involve execution of embedded (or
   linked) content that may include executable code, evaluating a mobile
   web URL involves risks.  If automatic evaluation of a mobile web link
   were to be used, the querying user would be exposed to risks
   associated with that automatic download and execution of content.
   Thus, the client MUST ask the querying user for confirmation before
   evaluating the mobile web URL; the client MUST NOT download and
   evaluate the mobile web content automatically.

   An analysis of threats specific to the dependence of ENUM on the DNS,
   (threats against which are covered in [17]) and the applicability of
   DNSSEC to these, is provided in RFC 3761.
