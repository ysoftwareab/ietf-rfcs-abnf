2.  Abstract

   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [1] defines a
   network representation of a search filter transmitted to an LDAP
   server.  Some applications may find it useful to have a common way of
   representing these search filters in a human-readable form.  This
   document defines a human-readable string format for representing the
   full range of possible LDAP version 3 search filters, including

   extended match filters.

   This document replaces RFC 2254.  See Appendix A for a list of
   changes relative to RFC 2254.

3.  LDAP Search Filter Definition

   An LDAPv3 search filter is defined in Section 4.5.1 of [1] as
   follows:

        Filter ::= CHOICE {
                and                [0] SET OF Filter,
                or                 [1] SET OF Filter,
                not                [2] Filter,
                equalityMatch      [3] AttributeValueAssertion,
                substrings         [4] SubstringFilter,
                greaterOrEqual     [5] AttributeValueAssertion,
                lessOrEqual        [6] AttributeValueAssertion,
                present            [7] AttributeDescription,
                approxMatch        [8] AttributeValueAssertion,
                extensibleMatch    [9] MatchingRuleAssertion
        }

        SubstringFilter ::= SEQUENCE {
                type    AttributeDescription,
                SEQUENCE OF CHOICE {
                        initial        [0] LDAPString,
                        any            [1] LDAPString,
                        final          [2] LDAPString
                }
        }

        AttributeValueAssertion ::= SEQUENCE {
                attributeDesc   AttributeDescription,
                attributeValue  AttributeValue
        }

        MatchingRuleAssertion ::= SEQUENCE {
                matchingRule    [1] MatchingRuleID OPTIONAL,
                type            [2] AttributeDescription OPTIONAL,
                matchValue      [3] AssertionValue,
                dnAttributes    [4] BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
        }

        AttributeDescription ::= LDAPString

        AttributeValue ::= OCTET STRING




Howes & Smith      Intended Category: Standards Track           [Page 2]

INTERNET-DRAFT   String Representation of LDAP Filters         July 2000


        MatchingRuleID ::= LDAPString

        AssertionValue ::= OCTET STRING

        LDAPString ::= OCTET STRING

   where the LDAPString above is limited to the UTF-8 encoding of the
   ISO 10646 character set [4].  The AttributeDescription is a string
   representation of the attribute description and is defined in [1].
   The AttributeValue and AssertionValue OCTET STRING have the form
   defined in [2].  The Filter is encoded for transmission over a
   network using the Basic Encoding Rules defined in [3], with
   simplifications described in [1].

4.  String Search Filter Definition

   The string representation of an LDAP search filter is defined by the
   following grammar, following the ABNF notation defined in [5].  The
   filter format uses a prefix notation.

        filter     = "(" filtercomp ")"
        filtercomp = and / or / not / item
        and        = "&" filterlist
        or         = "|" filterlist
        not        = "!" filter
        filterlist = 0*filter
        item       = simple / present / substring / extensible
        simple     = attr filtertype value
        filtertype = equal / approx / greater / less
        equal      = "="
        approx     = "~="
        greater    = ">="
        less       = "<="
        extensible = attr [":dn"] [":" matchingrule] ":=" value
                     / [":dn"] ":" matchingrule ":=" value
        present    = attr "=*"
        substring  = attr "=" [initial] any [final]
        initial    = value
        any        = "*" *(value "*")
        final      = value
        attr       = AttributeDescription from Section 4.1.5 of [1]
        matchingrule = MatchingRuleId from Section 4.1.9 of [1]
        value      = AttributeValue from Section 4.1.6 of [1] with some characters
                escaped (see below).

   The attr and matchingrule constructs are as described in the
   corresponding section of [1] given above.




Howes & Smith      Intended Category: Standards Track           [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT   String Representation of LDAP Filters         July 2000


   The value construct is as described in the corresponding section of
   [1] given above, except that if an AttributeValue contains any of the
   following characters

        Character       ASCII value
        ---------------------------
        *               0x2a
        (               0x28
        )               0x29
        \               0x5c
        NUL             0x00

   the character must be encoded as the backslash '\' character (ASCII
   0x5c) followed by the two hexadecimal digits representing the ASCII
   value of the encoded character. The case of the two hexadecimal
   digits is not significant.

   This simple escaping mechanism eliminates filter-parsing ambiguities
   and allows any filter that can be represented in LDAP to be
   represented as a NUL-terminated string. Other characters besides the
   ones listed above may be escaped using this mechanism, for example,
   non-printing characters.

   For example, the filter checking whether the "cn" attribute contained
   a value with the character "*" anywhere in it would be represented as
   "(cn=*\2a*)".

   Note that although both the substring and present productions in the
   grammar above can produce the "attr=*" construct, this construct is
   used only to denote a presence filter.

5.  Examples

   This section gives a few examples of search filters written using
   this notation.

        (cn=Babs Jensen)
        (!(cn=Tim Howes))
        (&(objectClass=Person)(|(sn=Jensen)(cn=Babs J*)))
        (o=univ*of*mich*)

   The following examples illustrate the use of extensible matching.

        (cn:1.2.3.4.5:=Fred Flintstone)
        (sn:dn:2.4.6.8.10:=Barney Rubble)
        (o:dn:=Ace Industry)
        (:dn:2.4.6.8.10:=Dino)




Howes & Smith      Intended Category: Standards Track           [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT   String Representation of LDAP Filters         July 2000


   The second example illustrates the use of the ":dn" notation to
   indicate that matching rule "2.4.6.8.10" should be used when making
   comparisons, and that the attributes of an entry's distinguished name
   should be considered part of the entry when evaluating the match.

   The third example denotes an equality match, except that DN
   components should be considered part of the entry when doing the
   match.

   The fourth example is a filter that should be applied to any
   attribute supporting the matching rule given (since the attr has been
   left off). Attributes supporting the matching rule contained in the
   DN should also be considered.

   The following examples illustrate the use of the escaping mechanism.

        (o=Parens R Us \28for all your parenthetical needs\29)
        (cn=*\2A*)
        (filename=C:\5cMyFile)
        (bin=\00\00\00\04)
        (sn=Lu\c4\8di\c4\87)

   The first example shows the use of the escaping mechanism to
   represent parenthesis characters. The second shows how to represent a
   "*" in a value, preventing it from being interpreted as a substring
   indicator. The third illustrates the escaping of the backslash
   character.

   The fourth example shows a filter searching for the four-byte value
   0x00000004, illustrating the use of the escaping mechanism to
   represent arbitrary data, including NUL characters.

   The final example illustrates the use of the escaping mechanism to
   represent various non-ASCII UTF-8 characters.

6.  Security Considerations

   This memo describes a string representation of LDAP search filters.
   While the representation itself has no known security implications,
   LDAP search filters do. They are interpreted by LDAP servers to
   select entries from which data is retrieved.  LDAP servers should
   take care to protect the data they maintain from unauthorized access.

   Please refer to the Security Considerations section of [6] for more
   information.

10.  Appendix A: Changes Since RFC 2254

10.1.  Technical Changes

   "Search Filter Definition" section: changed the ABNF definition of
   empty filter set).  This change aligns this document with RFC 2251
   and allows the full range of possible LDAPv3 filters to be
   represented.  The authors do not believe that this change will cause
   significant interoperability problems.

10.2.  Editorial Changes

   IESG Note: removed note about lack of satisfactory mandatory
   authentication mechanisms.

   "Abstract" section: updated second paragraph to indicate that RFC
   2254 is replaced by this document (instead of RFC 1960).

   Clarified the definition of 'value' to take into account the fact
   that it is not precisely an AttributeValue from RFC 2251 section
   4.1.6 (special handling is required for some characters).

   "Security Considerations" section: added reference to RFC 2829.

   "References" section: added entries for RFC 2829 and updated UTF-8
   reference to RFC 2279.
