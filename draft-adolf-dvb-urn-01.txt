Abstract

   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for
   the Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB) for naming persistent
   resources defined within DVB standards. Example resources include
   technical documents and specifications, eXtensible Markup Language
   (XML) Schemas, classification schemes, XML Document Type Definitions
   (DTDs), namespaces, style sheets, media assets, and other types of
   resources produced or managed by DVB.

1.  Introduction

   The Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB) is an industry-led
   consortium of over 270 broadcasters, manufacturers, network
   operators, software developers, regulatory bodies and others in over
   35 countries committed to designing global standards for the global
   delivery of digital television and data services. Services using DVB
   standards are available on every continent with a total of more than
   100 million DVB receivers already deployed.

   DVB would like to assign unique, permanent, location-independent
   names based on URNs for some resources it produces or manages. These
   URns will be constructed according to the URN sytax defined in
   [RFC2141].

   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace to be
   registered according to the procedures set forth in [RFC3406].


2.  Specification Template

   This section provides the information required to register a formal
   namespace according to the registration procedure defined in
   [RFC3406]. The URns conform to the syntax defined in [RFC2141].

   Namespace ID:

      "dvb"

   Registration Information:

      Version: 1
      Date: 2007-02-28

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Name:           Peter MacAvock

Internet Draft     DVB URN            July 12, 2007


      Title:          Executive Director, DVB Project Office
      Affiliation:    DVB Digital Video Broadcasting
      Address:        Ancienne Route 17a
                      CH-1218 Geneva
                      SWITZERLAND
      Phone:          +41 22 717 2719
      Email:          macavock@dvb.org

   Declaration of structure:

      URNs assigned by DVB will have the following hierarchical
      structure based on the organizational structure of the DVB
      standards:

         urn:dvb:{NSS}

      where the syntax of "{NSS}" is specified in Section 2.2 of the URN
      Syntax requirements ([RFC2141]).

      The individual URNs will be assigned by DVB through the process of
      development of DVB standards.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      None

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      DVB will establish unique identifiers as appropriate.

      Uniqueness is guaranteed as long as the assigned string is never
      reassigned.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      DVB is committed to maintaining the accessibility and persistence
      of all resources that are officially assigned URNs by the
      organization.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      Assignment is limited to the owner and those authorities that are
      specifically designated by the owner. DVB may designate portions
      of its namespace for assignment by other parties.

   Process of identifier resolution:

      The owner will develop and maintain "URN catalogues" that map all

Internet Draft     DVB URN            July 12, 2007


      assigned URNs to Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) specifically to
      enable Web-based resolution of named resources.  In the future an
      interactive online resolution system may be developed to automate
      this process.

      The owner will authorize additional resolution services as
      appropriate.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      The "assigned US-ASCII string" is case-insensitive.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified. The owner will develop and maintain URN
      catalogues.  The presence of a URN in a catalogue indicates that
      it is valid.

   Scope:

      Global

3.  Examples

   The following examples are not guaranteed to be real. They are
   presented for pedagogical reasons only.

      urn:dvb:ipdc:esg:2005
      urn:dvb:cs:ZappingTypeCS:2001

4.  Namespace Considerations

   URN assignment procedures:

      The individual URNs shall be assigned through the process of
      development of DVB standards by the Digital Video Broadcasting
      Project (DVB).

   URN resolution/delegation:

      The resolution and delegation shall be determined through the
      process of development of DVB standards by the Digital Video
      Broadcasting Project (DVB).

Internet Draft     DVB URN            July 12, 2007


   Type of resources to be identified:

      Types of resources to be identified include XML schema definition
      files, classification schemes and identification systems.

   Type of services to be supported:

      Types of services supported include controlled term lookup in
      classification schemes, resolution of ids in identification
      systems.

5.  Community Considerations

   Open assignment and use of identifiers within the namespace:

      With on-going development of DVB standards, DVB will establish
      requirements for assignment and use of identifiers within the DVB
      namespace.

   Open operation of resolution servers for the namespace (server):

      With on-going development of DVB standards, DVB will establish
      requirements and seek candidates for operating resolution servers
      as appropriate.

   Creation of software that can meaningfully resolve and access
   services for the namespace (client):

      With on-going development of DVB standards, DVB members will
      develop software implementations of its standards.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a URN NID registration of "dvb". IANA is
   requested to include it in the URN Namespaces registry.
