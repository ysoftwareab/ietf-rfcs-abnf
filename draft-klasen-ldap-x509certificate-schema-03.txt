Abstract

   This document describes an LDAP schema which can be used to implement
   a certificate store for X.509 certificates.  Specifically, two
   structural object classes for X.509 user and CA certificates are
   defined.  Key fields of a certificate are stored in LDAP attributes

   so that applications can easily retrieve the certificates needed by
   using basic LDAP search filters.  Multiple certificates for a single
   entity can be stored and retrieved.

Internet-Draft    An LDAPv3 Schema for X.509 Certificates      June 2003


1. Introduction

   A key component in the wide-spread adoption of a PKI infrastructure
   is the general availability of public keys and their certificates.
   Today, certificates are often published in an X.500 compliant
   directory service.  These directories are accessed by applications
   using the LDAP v3 [RFC3377] protocol.  An LDAPv3 schema for PKI
   repository objects is specified in [pkix-ldap-schema], where a set of
   object classes, attribute types, syntaxes, and extended matching
   rules are defined.  For storing certificates, the "userCertificate"
   and "cACertificate" attribute types are used.  All certificates of an
   entity are stored as values in these multi-valued attributes.  This
   solution has a serious drawback.  In LDAP, the smallest granularity
   of data access is the attribute.  The directory server will therefore
   always return the full list of certificates of an entry to clients
   dealing with certificates.  If the number of certificates for an
   entity is large this will result in considerable overhead and burden
   to the client.

   This document proposes to solve this problem by the use of the
   structural object classes x509userCertificate and x509caCertificate
   for storing certificates.  Each certificate will be stored in a
   separate entry in the directory.

   While it is a simple matter to modify the DIT in such a way that all
   certificate information is removed from the entries and placed in the
   container directly beneath the entries according to the definitions
   of this specification, it is less simple to simultaneously modify all
   of the applications that depend on certificates being stored in the
   entry.  Thus, it may be desirable to duplicate the certificate
   information, by having it appear in the entry, as well as in the
   container beneath the entry for a short period of time, in order to
   allow for migration of the applications to the new LDAP schema.  As
   in any situation in which information is duplicated, great care must
   be taken in order to ensure the integrity and consistency of the
   information.

   Fields of certificates which are needed to identify a certificate and
   those which are often used in searching for an appropriate
   certificate, are extracted from the certificate and stored as
   attributes of the entry.  Each attribute type uses existing LDAP
   syntax, so that no new matching rules need to be defined.
   Applications can thus search for specific certificates with simple
   LDAP filters.  This approach could be named a metadata approach,
   since data (attributes) about data (certificate) are stored.

   The use of simple attributes also makes a large scale widely
   distributed certificate repository service possible by using an

   indexing service based on The Common Indexing Protocol (CIP)
   [RFC2651], which defines a protocol between index servers for
   exchanging indexobjects in order to facilitate query routing.  The
   Tagged Index Object format as specified in [RFC2654] was specified to
   carry directory server information, by collecting the single
   attributetypes and values.

   This document is one of a set following this approach comprising:

   1.  the LDAP schema for X.509 public key certificates (this document)

   2.  the LDAP schema for X.509 attribute certificates [ldap-ac-schema]

   3.  the LDAP schema for X.509 CRLs [ldap-crl-schema]

   Two alternative approaches are discussed in the next two sections.

2. Comparison with Values Return Filter Control

   In [matchedval] a control has been defined that allows for only a
   subset of values of a specified attribute to be returned from a
   matching entry, by defining a filter for the returned values.  In
   this section, this approach is compared with the one proposed in this
   document.

   The major benefit of the Values Return Filter Control is that it does
   not require any changes to the DIT.

   There are several advantages in using the x509certificate object
   class.  No special matching rules are needed to retrieve a specific
   certificate.  Any field in the certificate can be used in the search
   filter.  Even information that doesn't appear in the certificate can
   be used in a search filter.  It is easier to remove certificates from
   the DIT, since the entire certificate BER/DER encoding does not have
   to be supplied in the modify operation.  Searches that don't need
   extensible matching rules and Values Return Filter Control will
   perform faster.

   Another advantage of the solution proposed here is that it will not
   be necessary to modify existing server implementations to support
   this schema.  The extended matching rules proposed in [pkix-ldap-
   schema] would require substantial changes in the servers' indexing
   mechanisms.  In contrast, servers implementing the x509certificate
   schema can easily leverage their indexing support for standard LDAPv3
   syntaxes.

   A CIP-based indexing system for a wide scale distributed certificate
   repository will rather be possible by using the solution proposed

   here due to its dependency on attribute values.

3. Comparison with component matching approach

   [componentmatch] defines a new mechanism for matching in complex
   syntaxes, by defining generic matching rules that can match any user
   selected component parts in an attribute value of any arbitrarily
   complex attribute syntax.  We believe that this might be the proper
   way to solve search problems in the longer term, but that it will
   take a long time until such ASN.1 based mechanisms will be
   implemented in LDAP servers and clients.  Even if this has happened
   the mechanism proposed here, will still be useful in the frame of
   CIP.  A simple and easy to implement mechanism is needed today and
   this is what this memo wants to provide.

4. The x509certificate object classes and their attribute types

   The description of all attributes with relevance to fields and
   extensions of an X.509 certificate include a respective reference to
   [X.509-2000] and to [RFC3280].

4.1 Attributes for mandatory fields of an X.509 certificate

4.1.1 X.509 version

   X.509 Version of the encoded certificate (See X.509(2000) 7, RFC3280
   4.1.2.1.) or of the CRL.

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.10126.1.5.3.1
           NAME 'x509version'
           DESC 'X.509 Version of the certificate, or of the CRL'
           EQUALITY integerMatch
           SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27
           SINGLE-VALUE )

   Values of this attribute may either be 0, 1, 2 or 3 corresponding to
   X.509 v1, v2, v3, or v4.

4.1.2 Serial number

   The serial number is an integer assigned by the CA to each
   certificate.  It is unique for each certificate issued by a given CA
   (i.e., the issuer name and serial number uniquely identify a
   certificate).  See X.509(2000) 7, RFC3280 4.1.2.2

   	      particular CA'
   	EQUALITY integerMatch
   	SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27 )


4.1.3 Signature algorithm

   OID identifying the algorithm used by the CA in signing the
   certificate (see X.509(2000) 7, RFC3280 4.1.2.3) or the CRL.

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.10126.1.5.3.3
   	NAME 'x509signatureAlgorithm'
   	DESC 'OID of the algorithm used by the CA in
   	      signing the CRL or the certificate'
   	EQUALITY objectIdentifierMatch
   	SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38
   	SINGLE-VALUE )


4.1.4 Issuer

   String representation of the issuer's distinguished name (see
   X.509(2000) 7, RFC3280 4.1.2.4)

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.10126.1.5.3.4
   	NAME 'x509issuer'
   	DESC 'Distinguished name of the entity who has signed and
   	      issued the certificate'
   	EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
   	SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12
   	SINGLE-VALUE )

   Values of this attribute type must be encoded according to the syntax
   given in [RFC2253].

4.1.5 Validity

   The "validity" attribute in an X.509 certificate (see X.509(2000) 7,
   RFC3280 4.1.2.5) consists of an ASN.1 sequence of two timestamps
   which define the begin and end of the certificate's validity period.
   This sequence has been split up into two separate attributes
   "x509validityNotBefore" and "x509validityNotAfter".  The times are
   represented in string form as defined in [RFC2252].

   Note that the field in the certificate may be in UTC or
   GeneralizedTime format.  If in UTC format, the creator of this
   attribute MUST convert the UTC time into GeneralisedTime format when
   creating the attribute value.

4.1.6 Subject

   String representation of the subject's distinguished name (see
   X.509(2000) 7, RFC3280 4.1.2.6).

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.10126.1.5.3.7

   	EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
   	SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12
   	SINGLE-VALUE )

   Values of this attribute type must be encoded according to the syntax
   given in [RFC2253].

4.1.7 Subject public key info algorithm

   OID identifying the algorithm associated with the certified public
   key (see X.509(2000) 7, RFC3280 4.1.2.7).

   	SINGLE-VALUE )


4.2 Attributes for selected extensions

   As this specification intends to only facilitate applications in
   finding certificates, only those extensions have to be defined that
   might be searched for.  Thus extensions described in [RFC3280] like
   the following are not dealt with here:

   o  private key usage period extension

   o  policy mappings extension

   o  subject directory attributes extension

   o  basic constraints extension

   o  name constraints extensions

   o  policy constraints extensions

   o  inhibit any policy extension

   o  freshest CRL extension

   o  authority information access extension

   o  subject information access extension


4.2.1 Authority key identifier extension

   This attribute identifies the public key to be used to verify the
   signature on this certificate or CRL (see X.509(2000) 8.2.2.1,
   RFC3280 4.2.1.1).  The key may be identified by an explicit key
   identifier in the keyIdentifier component, by identification of a
   certificate for the key (giving certificate issuer in the
   authorityCertIssuer component and certificate serial number in the
   authorityCertSerialNumber component), or by both explicit key
   identifier and identification of a certificate for the key.

4.2.3 Key usage extension

   This attribute defines the purpose (e.g., encipherment, signature,
   certificate signing) of the key contained in the certificate (see
   X.509(2000) 8.2.2.3, RFC3280 4.2.1.3).

5. DIT structure and naming

   If the schema presented in this document is used to store certificate
   information in a directory that contains entries for organizations,
   persons, services, etc., each certificate belonging to an entity
   SHOULD be stored as a direct subordinate to the entity's entry.  In
   this case, these entries MUST be named by a multi-valued RDN formed
   by the certificate issuer and serial number, as this is the only way
   to enforce unique RDN under the siblings.  This is expressed in the
   following two name forms:

   	NAME "x509caCertificateNameform"
   	OC x509caCertificate
   	MUST ( x509serialNumber $ x509issuer ) )

   There are some LDAP implementations that don't support multi-valued
   RDNs.  These can use following alternative two name forms:

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.10126.1.5.5.8
         NAME "x509userCertificateAltNameForm"
         OC x509userCertificate
         MUST x509issuerSerial )


   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.10126.1.5.5.9
         NAME "x509PcaCertificateAltNameForm"
         OC x509caCertificate
         MUST x509issuerSerial )

   The attribute description of x509issuerSerial can be found in [ldap-
   ac-schema]

   For public directories of CAs that, besides the data stored in the
   certificates, do not hold any additional data about end entities the
   following DIT structure might be preferable.  Entries for
   certificates are stored directly below the issuing CA's entry.  In
   this case these entries SHOULD be named by the certificate serial
   number.  This is expressed in the following two name forms:

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.10126.1.5.5.10
   	NAME "x509userCertificateSerialNumberNameForm"
   	OC x509userCertificate

   	NAME "x509caCertificateSerialNumberNameForm"
   	OC x509caCertificate
   	MUST x509serialNumber )

   Care must be taken when encoding DNs that contain an x509issuer
   attribute.  Such a value is a string representation according to

   [RFC2253].  These strings contain RFC2253 special characters and must
   therefore be escaped.  For example, the issuer name in a certificate
   may be:

   x509issuer: OU=VeriSign Trust Network,OU=(c) 1998 VeriSign\2c Inc. -
     For authorized use only,OU=Class 1 Public Primary Certification Au
     thority - G2,O=VeriSign\2c Inc.,C=US

   When used in a DN, this will be appear as:

    \2cOU\3d(c) 1998 VeriSign\5c\2c Inc. - For authorized use only\2cOU\3d

6. Security Considerations

   Attributes of directory entries are used to provide descriptive
   information about the real-world objects they represent which can be
   people, organizations, or devices.  Most countries have privacy laws
   regarding the publication of information about people.

   Without additional mechanisms such as Operation Signatures [RFC2649]
   which allow a client to verify the origin and integrity of the data
   contained in the attributes defined in this document, a client MUST
   NOT treat this data as authentic.  Clients MUST only use - after
   proper validation - the data which they obtained directly from the
   certificate.  Directory administrators MAY deploy ACLs which limit
   access to the attributes defined in this document to search filters.

   Transfer of cleartext passwords is strongly discouraged where the
   underlying transport service cannot guarantee confidentiality and may
   result in disclosure of the password to unauthorized parties.

   In order to protect the directory and its contents, strong
   authentication MUST have been used to identify the Client when an
   update operation is requested.

Appendix B. Sample searches

   This section details how clients should access the certstore.  The
   searches are presented in LDAP URL format.

   Retrieve all certificates for an end entity from a certstore using
   the first DIT structure:

   ldap:///CN=Norbert%20Klasen,O=DAASI%20International%20GmbH,C=de?
   	x509userCert?one?(objectClass=x509userCertificate)

   Find a certificate in a trustcenter's certstore suitable for sending
   an encrypted S/MIME message to "norbert.klasen@daasi.de"
