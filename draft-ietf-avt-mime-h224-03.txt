Abstract

   In conversional video applications far end camera control protocol is
   used by participants to control the remote camera.  The protocol that
   is commonly used is ITU H.281 over H.224.  The document registers the
   H224 media type.  It defines the syntax and the semantics of the SDP
   parameters needed to support far end camera control protocol using
   H.224.

1.  Introduction

   The document registers the H224 media type that may be used by
   systems that uses SDP [RFC2327].

   This media type is used for supporting the simple far end camera
   control protocol on SDP based systems.  The media type helps
   signaling gateways between H.323 [ITU.H323] and SDP based systems to
   use far end camera control, end to end, without having any protocol
   translation in the middle.

   The document defines H224 media type since the RTP packets in H.323
   annex Q [ITU.H323] carry H.224 frames[ITU.H224] The far end camera
   control protocol (FECC) is internal to H.224 frame and is identified
   by the client ID field of the H.224 packet.

   The document will define the SDP [RFC2327] parameters needed to
   support the above far end camera control protocol in systems that use
   SDP

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant RTP implementations.

3.  Far-end camera control protocol

   This simple protocol is based on ITU-T H.281[ITU.281] frames inside
   ITU-T H.224 packets in an RTP/UDP channel.  H.323 annex Q specifies
   how to build the RTP packets from the H.224 packets.

   Using far end camera control protocol in point to point calls and
   multipoint calls for packet switch networks is described in H.323
   annex Q

4.  IANA Considerations

   This section describes the media types and names associated with this
   payload format.  The registration uses the templates defined in
   RFC2048 [RFC2048] and draft-freed-media-type-reg-05 [I-D.freed-media-
   type-reg] it follows RFC3555 [RFC3555].

4.1.  Registration of MIME media type application/h224

   MIME media type name: application

   MIME subtype name: H224

   Required parameters: None

   Optional parameters: None

   Encoding considerations:

      This media type is framed (see H.323 Annex Q [ITU.H323]) and
      contains binary data

   Security considerations: See Section 6

   Interoperability considerations:

      Terminals sending simple far end camera control command should use
      this MIME type, receivers who can not support the protocol will
      reject the channel.

   Published specification: RFC yyy

   Applications which use this media type:

      Video conferencing applications.

   Additional information: none

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:

      This media type depends on RTP framing, and hence is only defined
      for transfer via RTP [RFC3550].  Transport within other framing
      protocols is not defined at this time.

5.  SDP Parameters

   The media media type application/h224 string is mapped to fields in
   the Session Description Protocol (SDP) as follows:

   o The media name in the "m=" line of SDP MUST be application.  The
   transport SHALL be any applicable RTP profile (for example RFC 3551
   [RFC3551]) and the payload type is dynamic.

   o The encoding name in the "a=rtpmap" line of SDP MUST be h224 (the
   MIME subtype).

   o The default clock rate in the "a=rtpmap" line MUST be 4800.

   The recommended maximum bandwidth for this protocol is 6.4 kbit/sec.

5.1.  Usage with the SDP Offer Answer Model

   When offering FECC using SDP in an Offer/Answer model [RFC3264] the
   following considerations are necessary.

   Far end camera control communication are uni-directional.  H.224 is
   bi-directional and can be used to learn the capabilities of the
   remote video end point e.g how many cameras it has.  The offer answer
   exchange is dependent on the functionality of both side.

   The offerer offers a sendonly channel if its camera can not be
   remotely controlled and if the offerer does not intend to use H.224
   to learn the capabilities of the remote video endpoints.

   In all other cases, when the offerer's camera can be remotely
   controlled and/or it intends to use H.224 capabilities negotiation,
   the offerer offers a sendrecv channel.

   The answerer behavior is as follows:

   If it receives an offer with sendonly it answers with a recvonly if
   it supports far end camera control, otherwise it ignores / reject the
   offer.

   If it receives an offer with sendrecv and its camera can be remotely
   controlled it answers with a sendrecv option.  If its camera cannot
   be remotely control it rejects the offer but may later try to
   remotely control the offerer's camera using this procedure.

6.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550] and any applicable profile, e.g.  RFC3551.
   This implies that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by
   encryption.

   A potential denial-of-service threat exists.  The attacker can inject
   pathological datagrams into the stream which may cause the receiver
   to move the camera randomly.  The usage of authentication of at least
   the RTP packet is RECOMMENDED

   As with any IP-based protocol, in some circumstances a receiver may
   be overloaded simply by the receipt of too many packets, either
   desired or undesired.  Network-layer authentication may be used to
   discard packets from undesired sources, but the processing cost of
   the authentication itself may be too high.
