1.    Introduction 
    
   LDELIVER is a LEMONADE extension to the IMAP protocol (P-IMAP) 
   defines extensions to the IMAPv4 Rev1 protocol [RFC3501] to enable 
   sending email as an IMAP command. This provides simple ways to 
   provide reply and forward without download with a gateway to the 
   email and submit servers. 
    
   LDELIVER is not intended to replace SMTP [RFC2821]. Instead it is 
   envisaged as a simple way to implement gateways that support features 
   like reply and forward without downloading complete messages whe the 
   email and submit servers may not support the commands described in 
   [LEMONADEPROFILE] to support such capabilities. 
    
   Of course, LDELIVER also allows reducing the amount of protocols to 
   support on the client, port to use and parameters to set or 
   provisions. 
    
   All these are important features required in particular to support 
   mobile email use cases [MEMAIL][OMA-ME-RD]: 
   - Forward and reply without download 
   - Ease of provisioning over the air 
   - Ease of manual provisioning 
   - Reduction of resources on the client 
   - Ease of implementation and deployment with existing email and 
     submit server 
   -  
   The server that supports LDELIVER can be used to send email, thus 
   eliminating the need for the client to connect to a separate SMTP 
   server.  
    
   When forwarding/replying to a message from the client, the end user 
   may choose to reattach the original's message attachments by just 
   specifying the UID of the original message and specifiers for the 
   required bodyparts.  The client need not download the attachments of

                              <LDELIVER>                    July 2005 
 
 
   the original message itself. This is an expected behavior of a server 
   that supports LDELIVER.  
    
   The client may also edit portions of these fields and re-compose the 
   edited body parts (addressees, body, attachments) using IMAP URL 
   [RFC2192] and a MIME header proposal, Content-External-Location which 
   accomplishes the same functionality as Lemonade CATENATE/BURL [BURL] 
   proposals.  
    
2.   Relation with other E-mail specifications 
    
   LDELIVER can be seen as a command that allows optimization of IMAP 
   for mobile clients.  
    
   The Lemonade Profile [LEMONADEPROFILE] specifies the Lemonade Pull 
   Model that governs the exchanges among mail servers or between 
   desktop mail client and mail servers. Lemonade investigates adding 
   mobile optimizations for the next version of the profile. 
    
   LDELIVER should be seen as a way to address the issues of mobile 
   optimization and an input to the Lemonade Profile work as a 
   alternative suitable for fast support of forward, reply and edit 
   without download.  
    
   Clients and servers MAY support other Lemonade extensions and 
   behaviors. 
    
   This document assumes that clients MUST be compliant to LDELIVER, if 
   they decide to use LDELIVER. The server that advertises support for 
   LDELIVER via CAPABILITY MUST be compliant to LDELIVER for its 
   exchanges with the mobile client.  
    
3.   Interactions between the Client and Server when supporting LDELIVER 
    
   A compliant server must support all IMAPv4Rev1 commands from client 
   devices following the syntax defined in [RFC3501].  Thus, a client 
   may issue any existing IMAP commands to the server, and both the 
   server and client must behave as specified in [RFC3501].   
    
    
4.   The CAPABILITY Command 
    
   The CAPABILITY command is defined in [RFC3501], section 6.1.1.  The 
   client sends a CAPABILITY command so it can query the server to find 
   out what commands it supports.  In [RFC3501], the IMAP server is 
   allowed to specify additional capabilities not included in that 
   specification.  A server that supports LDELIVER conforms to that 
   requirement, and MUST list that it supports LDELIVER.

   A server can also enumerate individually the other commands that it 
   supports.  
    
   capability_cmd =  tag SP "CAPABILITY"  
   Valid States:  NOT AUTHENTICATED, AUTHENTICATED, SELECTED, or LOGOUT 
   Responses:  REQUIRED untagged response: CAPABILITY 
   Result:  OK - capability completed 
      BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid 
    
   Example: A server that implements LDELIVER.  
      C: a001 CAPABILITY 
      S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 AUTH=LOGIN IDLE LDELIVER 
      S: a001 OK CAPABILITY completed 
    
5.   Specification details 
    
5.1.     the LDELIVER command 
    
   The LDELIVER command can be used for creating new messages, or 
   replying to/forwarding an existing message. The first argument after 
   the command name indicates whether this is a new message "N", a reply 
   "R" or a forward "F" of an existing message. When replying/forwarding 
   a message, the client must specify the UID validity (See [IMAP-DISC]) 
   and UID of the message being replied to or forwarded and whether or 
   not to include the attachments of the original message in the 
   reply/forward, by indicating either "Y" or "N" after the UID 
   parameter.  If nothing is mentioned, the text of the message being 
   replied to/forwarded is automatically appended to the end of the new 
   message regardless. Edits of part of the message (including reply 
   address fields also treated as a body part, body or attachments) can 
   be performed by the client. Composition on the server is then done 
   using Content-External-Location. If the user wishes to save a copy of 
   this message to some folder, it can specify that next by using 
   "SAVETO" followed by the name of the folder.  If and only if SAVETO 
   is specified, the server will return an LDELIVERUID response code 
   with the UID validity and then the UID of that saved message in that 
   folder.  If the message cannot be saved to the server, an okay 
   response will still be returned, but without a UID.  The ENVELOPE 
   argument specifies the list of recipients that this message is 
   delivered to, analogous to the SMTP RCPT TO envelop. The last 
   argument of the LDELIVER command is a number in braces that denotes 
   the number of bytes in the message (conforming to [RFC2822]) that is 
   to follow.  A "+" before the closing braces means the client will 
   send a CRLF and then the message immediately, without waiting for a 
   continuance response from the server.  The server continues to wait 
   until it receives the number of bytes specified, and then waits for 
   an additional CRLF.  If more bytes were input before this additional 
   CRLF than was specified, the server returns an error.  Thus, the

   client should input exactly the number of bytes specified for the 
   Internet Address, and then one final CRLF to terminate the LDELIVER.  
    
   The ldeliver command can used after the client has been 
   authenticated.  This command will not disturb the current IMAP 
   connection, meaning that the server will not send back any untagged 
   responses, (such as EXISTS, EXPUNGE, etc.) as a response to LDELIVER.    
    
   ldeliver_cmd = tag SP "LDELIVER" SP  
                  ("N") / (("R"/"F") SP folder SP uid-validity SP uid SP 
                  ("Y" / "N)) 
                  [SP "SAVETO="  folder] SP ENVELOPE recipient-list  "{" 
   number ["+"] "}"   
                  internet_msg 
    
   recipient-list = ô(ô 1*address ô)ö / nil 
   address =  defined in RFC3501 Section 9 (Formal Syntax) 
    
   Valid States:  AUTHENTICATED, SELECTED 
   Responses:  no responses 
   Result:  OK - mail delivered successfully by the SMTP server,  
                 LDELIVERUID response code included if the SAVETO is  
                 included in the command. 
            BAD - invalid arguments, for example missing parameter.

   A reply message for message 203 is prepared and includes all  
   original attachments. 
      S: A001 OK LDELIVER completed 
    
5.2.     Content-External-Location, IMAP URL, and Server based attachments 
   
   A LDELIVER compliant client may support adding attachments from 
   either local storage, or re-attaching remote attachments stored in 
   another IMAP message.  
    
   On replying to or forwarding a message, the client allows the user to 
   compose the body of the message as well it may offer the user the 
   option to re-attach remote attachments. It may do so, by issuing a 
   BODYSTRUCTURE request, and allowing the user to choose which 
   attachment parts of the original message to re-attach. 
    
   Instead of then downloading those attachments in full and re-
   attaching them locally, the client may form an IMAP URL [RFC2192] 
   such as ôimap://server/INBOX/;uid=100;section=1.2ö and then add an 
   attachment to the composed message that includes this URL in a 
   Content-External-Location header. 
    
   Example message 
    
   From: sender@sender.org 
   To: receiver@receiver.org 
   Subject: those attachments that originator@originator.org sent 
   Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=myboundary

   I donÆt like this photo that Originator took. 
    
   --myboundary 
   Content-Type: image/jpeg 
   Content-External-Location: imap://server/INBOX/;uid=100;section=1.2 
    
   Text here is attached as a placeholder if the fetch fails

   The server, upon receiving the LDELIVERed message, replaces any MIME 
   parts containing Content-External-Location by fetching the IMAP URLs 
   (if possible) and replacing the content of the placeholder attachment 
   with the content of the fetched attachment. 
 
    
6.   Note on LDELIVER, SMTP and Lemonade Profile 
    
   A server MAY always rather support SMTP instead of LDELIVER. A client 
   MAY then select to rely on SMTP instead of LDELIVER. This of course 
   may reduce the forward / reply without download capabilities that may 
   be available. 
    
   A server MAY also advertise via capability support for Lemonade 
   Profile [LEMONADEPROFILE] or the subset of commands (see 
   [LEMONADEPROFILE] needed to support forward without download. In such 
   case, the client MAY rely on the Lemonade profile forward without 
   download mechanisms. 
    
   When it comes to mobile clients, it is generally not expected that 
   mobile clients will run mailing list services from mobile devices, 
   utilize large distribution lists, or run automated mail notification 
   services. Therefore, LDELIVER is not designed to support SMTP 
   functions which take advantage of full control of the SMTP envelop, 
   or SMTP extensions like NOTARY. 
    
   In general, because of mobile device resource constraints, and 
   corporate firewall and security policies, LDELIVER is easier to 
   deploy for mobile devices, than exposing and restricting SMTP 
   services to mobile devices, especially those devices without VPN 
   functionality. 
    
Security Considerations 
    
   The protocol calls for the same security requirements as IMAP and 
   [LEMONADEPROFILE].   
 
   It is also recommended that clients be explicitly registered with the 
   server through separate channels / application. Exchanges should then 
   be paired, encrypted and signed as deemed appropriate by the user and 
   administrators. 
    
   When an implementation is based on gateways, this may create new 
   security issues.   
    
   In some implementations, the client may connect to a proxy that sits 
   in an operator network, but the backend email storage server sits in 
   a separate enterprise network.  The enterprise network is assumed to 
   be secure, but the operator network may not be trusted.  If

   unencrypted information lies in the operator network, that 
   information is vulnerable to attacks. 
    
   If the LDELIVER server is implemented in the enterprise network, then 
   the proxy on the carrier should be an encrypted SSL pass-through 
   proxy.  The proxy is unaware of the encryption keys and thus cannot 
   encrypt any data.  Without the encryption key, this proxy cannot see 
   any of the information sent from the client, nor can it send any 
   bogus commands to the backend enterprise email server to corrupt the 
   user's mailbox.  The additional cost for this design is that the 
   backend enterprise email server and the client devices must have 
   additional processing to handle this encryption. 
    
   If the LDELIVER server is implemented as a backend IMAP server with 
   additional command processing done on it, there are more complex 
   security issues.  This proxy must be able to send commands to the 
   backend server to accomplish its tasks, as well as read information 
   coming from the backend server.  An attacker thus can send commands 
   to the backend.    This proxy may also send bogus responses back to 
   the client.  Clearly, this setup is not an ideal issue and many 
   complications that make this problem complex to solve.  The 
   suggestion recommended is to rely on encrypted messages to be 
   decrypted at the backend submit server before being sent by it. The 
   key exchange for encryption should not occur through the proxy.  It 
   has to be done through another channel: manually entered by user 
   (e.g. password), or via an HTTP SSL request to the enterprise server.
