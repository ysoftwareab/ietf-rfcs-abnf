INTERNET DRAFT     NVO3 Geneve applicability for SFC       March 1, 2018


1. Introduction

   The Service Function Chaining (SFC) Architecture [rfc7665] defines a
   service function chain (SFC) as (1) the instantiation of an ordered
   set of service functions and (2) the subsequent "steering" of traffic
   through them.

   SFC defines a Service Function Path (SFP) as the exact set of service
   function forwarders (SFF)/service functions (SF)s the packet will
   visit when it actually traverses the network.

   An optimized SFP helps to build an efficient Service function chain
   (SFC) that can be used to steer traffic based on classification
   rules, and metadata information to provide services for Network
   Function Virtualization (NFV).  Metadata are typically passed between
   service functions and Service function forwarders SFF(s) along a
   service function path.

   In a Network Virtualization Overlays (NVO3) domain, Network
   Virtualization Edges (NVE)s can be implemented on hypervisors hosting
   virtual network functions (VNF)s implementing service functions, or
   on physical routers connected to service function appliances. NVO3
   domain uses tunneling and encapsulation protocols such as Geneve to
   provide connectivity for tenants workloads and service function
   running in its domain. NVEs in an NVO3 domain are typically
   controlled by a centralized network virtualization authority NVA.

   [RFC8300] defines a new encapsulation protocol, network service
   header (NSH) to encode the SFP and the metadata.

1.1 Requirement for SFC in NVO3 domain

   The requirement is to provide service function chaining in an NVO3
   domain without the need to implement yet another control plane for
   service topology.

1.2 Proposed solution for SFC in NVO3 domain

   This document specifies the applicability of using Generic Network
   Virtualization Encapsulation (Geneve), to carry the service function
   path (SFP) information, and the network service header (NSH)
   encapsulation.

   The SFP will be implemented using a new Geneve Service Function List
   (SFL) option for use strictly between Network Virtualization Edges
   (NVEs) performing the service forwarding function (SFF) in the same
   Network Virtualization Overlay over Layer 3 NVO3 domain. The next
   protocol in the Geneve Header will be the NSH EtherType, 0x894F. The

   NSH encapsulation will include the Service Path Identifier (SPI) and
   the Service Index (SI). The NSH SI will serve as an index to the VNF
   hop to visit in the SFL.

   In the absence of the SFL we would need a service topology control
   plane. The Geneve overlay will encap the NSH encapsulation and the
   next protocol on Geneve will be the NSH Ethertype.

   When present, the HMAC sub-TLV MUST be encoded as the last sub-TLV.

   If the HMAC sub-TLV is present, the H-Flag (Figure 2) MUST be set.

   When the H-flag is set, the NVE inspecting the Geneve Service
   Function List Option TLV MUST find the HMAC sub-TLV in the last 38
   octets of the option TLV.

5. Operation

   The mechanisms described in this section should work with both ipv4
   and ipv6 for both customer inner payload and Geneve tunnel packets.

5.1 Operation at Ingress

   A Source NVE acting as a service function classifier and a service
   function forwarder can be any node in an NVO3 domain, originating
   based on a classification policy for some customer inner payload an
   IP Geneve tunnel packet with the service function list (SFL) option
   TLV. The service functions in the SFL represent the IP addresses of
   the service functions that the inner customer packets needs to be
   inspected by. A controller can program the ingress NVE node to
   classify traffic and identify a service function paths i.e the set of
   service functions in the path. The mechanism through which an SFL is
   derived by a controller or any other mechanisms is outside of the
   scope of this document. 

   The ingress NVE node fills in the list of service functions in the
 


Boutros                Expires September 2, 2018                [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT     NVO3 Geneve applicability for SFC       March 1, 2018


   path, to the Geneve Service Function List option TLV, putting the
   first service function ip address as the last element in the list and
   the last service function ip address as the first element, setting of
   the NSH service index to the first element. The ingress NVE node,
   then, resolves the service first function ip address, to the NVE
   virtual tunnel endpoint node hosting or directly connected to the
   service function. 

   The Geneve tunnel destination is then set to the NVE tunnel endpoint
   hosting the first service function, and the service index is
   decremented to n-1 (where n is the number of elements in the SFL),
   and set on the SFL option TLV. An NSH metadata can also be set on the
   packet by the NVE ingress node.

   The Geneve packet is sent out towards the first NVE.

   HMAC optional sub-TLV may be set too.

5.2 Operation at each NVE along the service function path

   The NVE node along the service function path corresponding to the
   Geneve tunnel destination of the packet, receives the packet, perform
   the service function forwarder function and identifies the SFL
   option, and locates the service function in the list based on the
   service index.

   The Geneve tunnel header and option TLV(s) will be stripped and the
   packet will be delivered to the service function or virtual network
   function (VNF). The NVE maintains state related to the association of
   the SFL option TLV and the NSH service path identifier. The packet
   passed to the service function encaped with the NSH header and NSH
   context, if the SF is NSH aware, other encapsulations like vlan or q-
   in-q encap may be used to pass the metadata and NSH SPI to the SF
   too.

   When the packet comes back from the service function along with the
   service path identifier (SPI) context, based on SPI on the packet the
   NVE acting as the SFF will be able to locate the SFL option TLV. 

   If the metadata context indicate (1) that some service functions need
   to be bypassed the NVE should bypass in the SFL the service functions
   to be skipped and update the NSH service index accordingly. (2) A new
   classification need to be performed on the packet, in that case the
   NVE can re-classify the packet or sent it to an NVE node capable of
   classification.

   The NVE node, then, resolves the next service function ip address, to
   the NVE virtual tunnel endpoint node hosting or directly connected to

INTERNET DRAFT     NVO3 Geneve applicability for SFC       March 1, 2018


   the service function.

   The NVE then sets the Geneve tunnel destination to the next NVE
   tunnel endpoint, and the NSH service index is decremented by 1 and
   set on the NSH Header, along with other NSH metadata option TLV.

   The Geneve ip packet is sent out towards the next NVE.

5.3 Operation at Egress

   At the last NVE node along the service function path, the NVE locates
   the service function in the SFL option TLV based on the NSH service
   index. The service index received at the last NVE node will be set to
   1.

   The Geneve tunnel header and option TLV(s) will be stripped and the
   packet will be delivered to the service function. The NVE maintains
   state related to the association of the SFL option TLV and the NSH
   service path identifier. The packet passed to the service function
   encaped with the NSH header and NSH context, if the SF is NSH aware,
   other encapsulations like vlan or q-in-q encap may be used to pass
   the metadata and NSH SPI to the SF too.

   When the packet comes back from the service function, based on NSH
   SPI on the packet or based the NVE will be able to locate the SFL
   option TLV. 

   Given that the service index will be set to 1, the last NVE will now
   deliver the packet to the NVE hosting or directly connected to the
   inner packet destination.

   A packet received with a service function index of 0 MUST be dropped.

6. Security Considerations

   Only NVE(s) that are the destinations of the Geneve tunnel packet
   will be inspecting the  List of Service Function next hops Option. A
   Source routing option has some well-known security issues as
   described in [RFC4942] and [RFC5095].

   The main use case for the use of the Geneve List of Service Function
   next hops Option will be within a single NVO3 administrative domain
   where only trusted NVE nodes are enabled and configured participate,
   this is the same model as in [RFC6554].  

   NVE nodes MUST ignore the Geneve List of Service Function next hops
   Option created by outsiders based on NVA or trusted control plane
   information.

   There is a need to prevent non-participating NVE node from using the
   Geneve Service Function List option TLV, as described in [draft-ietf-
   6man-segment-routing-header], we will use a security sub-TLV in the
   Service Function List option TLV, the security sub-TLV will be based
   on a key-hashed message authentication code (HMAC).

   HMAC sub-TLV will contain:

   HMAC Key-id, 32 bits wide;

   HMAC, 256 bits wide (optional, exists only if HMAC Key-id is not 0).

   The HMAC field is the output of the HMAC computation (per RFC 2104
   [RFC2104]) using a pre-shared key identified by HMAC Key-id and of
   the text which consists of the concatenation of:

   The source IPv4/IPv6 Geneve tunnel address

   Version and Flags

   HMAC Key-id.

   All addresses in the List.

   The purpose of the HMAC optional sub-TLV is to verify the validity,
   the integrity and the authorization of the Geneve Service Function
   List option TLV itself.  

   The HMAC optional sub-TLV is located at the end of the Geneve Service
   Function List option TLV. 

   The HMAC Key-id field serves as an index to the right combination of
   pre-shared key and hash algorithm and except that a value of 0 means
   that there is no HMAC field. 

   The HMAC Selection of a hash algorithm and Pre-shared key management
   will follow the procedures described in [draft-ietf-6man-segment-
   routing-header] section 6.2.
