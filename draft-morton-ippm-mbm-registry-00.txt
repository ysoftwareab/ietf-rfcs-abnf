1.  Introduction

   Note: Efforts to synchronize structure and terminology with
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] will likely be incomplete until both
   drafts are stable.

   This memo proposes a (set of) entry(ies) for the Performance Metric
   Registry, based on Model-Based Metrics (MBM).  It uses terms and
   definitions from the IPPM literature, primarily [RFC2330].

2.  Scope

   This document defines one of the initial set of Performance Metrics
   Registry entries, for which IETF approval (following development in
   the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group) will satisfy the
   requirement for Expert Review.  Note that all are Active Performance
   Metrics, which are based on RFCs prepared in the IPPM working group
   of the IETF, according to their framework [RFC2330] and its updates.

3.2.  Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary
   details related to the metric definition, including the RFC reference
   and values of input factors, called fixed parameters.

3.2.1.  Reference Definition

   <Full bibliographic reference to an immutable doc.>

   <specific section reference and additional clarifications, if needed>

   Mathis, M. and A.  Morton, "Model Based Metrics for Bulk Transport
   Capacity", draft-ietf-ippm-model-based- metrics-08 (work in
   progress), July 2016.

   The primary metrics of measurement are round-trip delay and one-way
   loss, measured under the conditions described in Section 8.5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-model-based-metrics].

   For loss:

   Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M.  Zekauskas, "A One-way Packet Loss
   Metric for IPPM", RFC 2680, DOI 10.17487/RFC2680, September 1999,
   <http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2680>.

   Section 2.4 of [RFC7680] provides the reference definition of the
   singleton (single value) one-way loss metric.  Section 3.4 of
   [RFC7680] provides the reference definition expanded to cover a
   multi-singleton sample.  Note that terms such as singleton and sample
   are defined in Section 11 of [RFC2330].

   For round-trip delay:

   Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., Zekauskas, M., and A.  Morton, Ed., "A One-
   Way Delay Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)", STD 81, RFC
   7679, DOI 10.17487/RFC7679, January 2016, <http://www.rfc-
   editor.org/info/rfc7679>.

   [RFC2681]

   <specific section reference and additional clarifications, if needed>

   Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] provides the reference definition of the
   singleton (single value) Round-trip delay metric.  Section 3.4 of
   [RFC2681] provides the reference definition expanded to cover a
   multi-singleton sample.  Note that terms such as singleton and sample
   are defined in Section 11 of [RFC2330].

Internet-Draft           Initial Registry Part 2            October 2016


   Note that although the definition of "Round-trip-Delay between Src
   and Dst" is directionally ambiguous in the text, this metric tightens
   the definition further to recognize that the host in the "Src" role
   will send the first packet to "Dst", and ultimately receive the
   corresponding return packet from "Dst" (when neither are lost).

   Finally, note that the variable "dT" is used in [RFC2681] to refer to
   the value of Round-trip delay in metric definitions and methods.  The
   variable "dT" has been re-used in other IPPM literature to refer to
   different quantities, and cannot be used as a global variable name.

3.2.2.  Fixed Parameters

   <list and specify Fixed Parameters, input factors that must be
   determined and embedded in the measurement system for use when
   needed>

   Type-P as defined in Section 13 of [RFC2330]:

   o  IPv4 header values:

      *  DSCP: set to 0

      *  TTL: set to 255

      *  Protocol: Set to 6 (TCP)

   o  IPv6 header values:

      *  DSCP: set to 0

      *  Hop Count: set to 255

      *  Protocol: Set to 6 (TCP)

   o  TCP header values:

      *  Checksum: the checksum MUST be calculated

   o  TCP Payload

      *  see target_MTU in Run-time parameters.

   Other measurement parameters:

   o  Tmax: a loss threshold waiting time

      *  3.0, expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of type
         decimal64 with fraction digits = 5 (see section 9.3 of
         [RFC6020]) and with resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), with
         lossless conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per
         section 6 of [RFC5905].

3.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

3.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   The method of measurement is described in Section 8.1.5 of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-model-based-metrics].

   @@@@<more could be said here about loss and RTT methods>

3.3.2.  Packet Stream Generation

   <list of generation parameters and section/spec references if needed>

   The stream generation parameters are described in Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-model-based-metrics].  They are dependent on the
   target parameters described in the Run-time parameters section below.

   packet_headway  Time interval between packets, specified from the
      start of one to the start of the next.

   burst_headway  Time interval between bursts, specified from the start
      of the first packet one burst to the start of the first packet of
      the next burst.

   paced_single_packets  Send individual packets at the specified rate
      or packet headway.

   paced_bursts  Send bursts on a timer.  Specify any 3 of: average data
      rate, packet size, burst size (number of packets) and burst
      headway (burst start to start).

   slowstart_rate  Mimic TCP slowstart by sending 4 packet paced bursts
      at an average data rate equal to twice the implied bottleneck IP
      capacity (but not more than the sender interface rate).

      specified number of packets packets in a two level burst pattern
      that resembles slowstart.

   repeated_slowstart_burst  Repeat Slowstart bursts once per
      target_RTT.

3.3.3.  Traffic Filtering (observation) Details

   <insert the measured results based on a filtered version of the
   packets observed, and this section provides the filter details (when
   present), and section reference>.

   NA

3.3.4.  Sampling Distribution

   <insert time distribution details, or how this is diff from the
   filter>

   NA

3.3.5.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   <list of run-time parameters, and any reference(s)>.

   The following parameters are described in [RFC2330]

   Src  the IP address of the host in the Src Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see Section 4 of [RFC6991])

   Dst  the IP address of the host in the Dst Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see section 4 of [RFC6991])

   T0 a time, the start of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-
      time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3
      of [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a start time is unspecified
      and Tf is to be interpreted as the Duration of the measurement
      interval.  The start time is controlled through other means.

   Tf a time, the end of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time"
      as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a end time date is ignored and
      Tf is interpreted as the Duration of the measurement interval.

   The following MBM-specific parameters are as defined in Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-model-based-metrics], and subsequent sections of the
   memo.

   target_rate  The specified application data rate required for an
      application's proper operation.

   target_RTT  The specified baseline (minimum) RTT of the longest
      complete path over which the user expects to be able meet the
      target performance.

   target_MTU  The specified maximum MTU supported by the complete path
      the over which the application expects to meet the target
      performance.

   target_window_size  The average number of packets in flight (the
      window size) needed to meet the Target Data Rate, for the
      specified Target RTT, and MTU.  It implies the scale of the bursts
      that the network might experience.

   subpath_???  Do we need a subpath-specific parameter?

   derating  The modeling framework permits some latitude in relaxing or
      "derating" some test parameters as described in Section 5.3 in
      exchange for a more stringent TIDS validation procedures,
      described in Section 10 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-model-based-metrics].

   test_window  The smallest window sufficient to meet or exceeded the
      target_rate when operating with a pure self clock over a test
      path.



   The following MBM-specific parameters are as defined in Section of
   7.2 [I-D.ietf-ippm-model-based-metrics]:

   H0H1_ratio  The value of the multiplier on the Null Hypothesis loss
      ratio used to calculate the Alternate Hypothesis loss ratio.

   alpha_TI_err  Measurements support accepting H0 with the specified
      Type I error = alpha (= 0.05 for example).

   beta_TII_err  Measurements support accepting H1 with the specified
      Type II error = beta (= 0.05 for example).

   Additional MBM-specific parameters may be calculated by the
   measurement system itself, or they may be supplied as additional Run-
   time parameters:

   Mean Round-trip Time:

   The mean SHALL be calculated using the conditional distribution of
   all packets with a finite value of round-trip delay (undefined delays
   are excluded), a single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   See section 4.2.2 of [RFC6049] for details on calculating this
   statistic, and 4.2.3 of [RFC6049].

   The time value of the result is expressed in units of seconds, as a
   positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 9 (see
   section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.000000001 seconds (1.0
   ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit NTP timestamp as
   per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905].

7.  Acknowledgements

   The authors thank Brian Trammell for suggesting the term "Run-time
   Parameters", which led to the distinction between run-time and fixed
   parameters implemented in this memo, for identifying the IPFIX metric
   with Flow Key as an example, and for many other productive
   suggestions.  Thanks to Peter Koch, who provided several useful
   suggestions for disambiguating successive DNS Queries in the DNS
   Response time metric.

   The authors also acknowledge the constructive reviews and helpful
   suggestions from Barbara Stark, Juergen Schoenwaelder, Tim Carey, and
   participants in the LMAP working group.
