Internet-Draft The IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option for Geographical December 2016


Abstract

   For IPv6-based ITS applications, ITS data packets are required to
   be delivered to a specific destination ITS node.
   In this draft, a new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop option, the IPv6 Geo-unicast
   Hop-by-Hop option, with the geographical information of the
   destination ITS node and the forwarding mechanism information
   is defined.

Internet-Draft The IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option for Geographical December 2016


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   
2.  Introduction

   For the support of IPv6-based ITS (Intelligent Transportation System)
   applications, ITS data packets are required to be delivered based
   on the geographical location (longitude and latitude) information of
   the destination ITS node or area. We call the former geographical
   unicast (in short, geo-unicast).

   From the considerations in [Geo-Problem], in this draft, we define
   the new IPv6 Geo-unicast Hop-by-Hop option with the geo-location
   information of the destination ITS node. Also, the IPv6 Geo-unicast
   Hop-by-Hop option has the field for the geographical unicast
   mechanism from the originator to the destination ITS node.


3. Terminology

   ITS node
      A vehicle or a device that may generate ITS-related data
      in the form of IPv6 datagrams

   Geo-location
      The location of an ITS node represented in the form of
      longitude and latitude. The geo-location information
      is represented in the form of the World Geodetic System 1984
      (WGS84) [WGS-84] formatted coordinates.

   Geographical Forwarding
      IPv6 datagram forwarding based on the geo-location information
      of the source and the destination ITS node or area.
      Geographical unicast/broadcast and geocast belong to geographical
      forwarding.

   Geographical Unicast (Geo-unicast)
      IPv6 datagram forwarding based on geo-location information
      to a specific single target ITS node which can be a vehicle or
      roadside unit (RSU) or any type of an IPv6 node.

   Originator
      The source ITS node that has generated this IPv6 datagram.

   Sender
      The previous hop ITS node that has forwarded this IPv6 datagram.


4. Hop-by-Hop Option for Geographical Unicast

   The format of the Geocast Hop-by-Hop option is as follows:

   IPv6 Source Address
      The Source IPv6 Address field of the IPv6 datagram is set to
      the IPv6 address of the originator.

   IPv6 Destination Address
      The Destination IPv6 Address field of the IPv6 datagram is set to
      the geo-unicast address to be assigned by IANA.

   Option Type
      The IPv6 Option Type code for IPv6 geo-unicast; to be assigned
      by IANA.

   Option Data Length
      The number of octets of the option data field of this option.

   C Flag
      This indicates the geographical casting type. 'C = 0' implies
      geographical unicast and 'C = 1' implies geocast.
      Thus, in this case, C = 0.

   Geo-Unicast Type
      This indicates the geo-unicast forwarding type used
      for the delivery of the IPv6 datagram from the originator to
      the destination ITS node; e.g., Greedy Forwarding (GF) [GF],
      Contension-Based Forwarding (CBF) [CBF], Greedy Perimeter
      Stateless Routing (GPSR), Geographic Source Routing (GS), etc.

   N Flag
      If N = 1, it indicates the latitude is north relative to the
      Equator. Otherwise, it indicates the latitude is south of
      the Equator.

   E Flag
      If E = 1, it indicates the longitude is east of the Prime
      Meridian. Otherwise, it indicates the longitude is west of
      the Prime Meridian.

   S Flag
      If S = 1, the Sender Latitude Degree and the Sender Longitude
      Degree fields are specified. Otherwise, those fields do not exist.

   O Flag
      If O = 1, the Originator Latitude Degree and the Originator
      Longitude Degree fields are specified. Otherwise, those fields
      do not exist.

   U Flag
      If U = 1, the Location Unicertainty field is specified.
      Otherwise, the field is not specified.

   Reserved
      The reserved field for further extensions of this option.

   Location Unicertainty
      The uncertainty of the location (in centimeters).

   Timestamp
      Time when this IPv6 datagram was generated in seconds since
      the epoch (00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970).

   Destination Latitude
      A range of 0 - 90 degrees (in 1/10 micro degrees) north or
      south of the Equator (northern or southern hemisphere,
      respectively) of the destination ITS node.

   Destination Longitude
      A range of 0 - 180 degrees (in 1/10 micro degrees) east or
      west of the Prime Meridian of the destination ITS node.

   Sender Latitude
      A range of 0 - 90 degrees (in 1/10 micro degrees) north or
      south of the Equator (northern or southern hemisphere,
      respectively) of the sender.

   Sender Longitude
      A range of 0 - 180 degrees (in 1/10 micro degrees)s east or
      west of the Prime Meridian of the sender.

   Originator Latitude
      A range of 0 - 90 degrees (in 1/10 micro degrees) north or
      south of the Equator (northern or southern hemisphere,
      respectively) of the originator.

   Originator Longitude
      A range of 0 - 180 degrees (in 1/10 micro degrees) east or
      west of the Prime Meridian of the originator.
