   New EPP Parameters for the usTLD                       February 2002 
   
   
  Abstract 
      
  This document defines two new EPP parameters to enable the exchange 
  of additional information between the registry and the registrars for 
  the United States ccTLD (usTLD). These two new parameters only apply 
  to contact objects served as registrants for usTLD domains. This is 
  accomplished according to the EPP extension framework in the command-
  response <extension> field.

  1. Introduction 
      
     EPP (i.e., Extensible Provisioning Protocol) defines an extensible 
     registry-registrar protocol for domain name registrations. It 
     consists of a suite of documents: the generic protocol framework 
     [3], and the object mappings for domain, host and contact [4-6], 
     and the transport mapping to TCP [7]. 
      
     The EPP extension framework allows registry specific features to 
     be added at three levels: protocol, object and command-response 
     [3]. The extensions made to EPP for the usTLD is at the command-
     response level. Specifically, two new information elements are 
     added to the <extension> field in the contact object. 
      
     The intent of this document is to specify the protocol elements in 
     EPP extensions in order to accommodate additional information 
     required for a registrar to interconnect with the usTLD registry 
     via an EPP-compatible interface. Specifically, the document

   New EPP Parameters for the usTLD                       February 2002 
   
   
     defines two new EPP parameters for contact objects to be used as 
     registrants for usTLD domains. The first parameter describes the 
     intended purpose of the domain name, while the second specifies 
     the Nexus category to which the registering organization belongs. 
     Both are defined as parameters within the command-response 
     <extension> field for the contact object [6], according to the EPP 
     extension framework outlined in [3]. 
      
     For more information about usTLD and Nexus requirements, please 
     refer to [8] and [9]. 
      
      
  2. EPP Extensions for the usTLD 
      
     The EPP extensions for the usTLD are in the contact object mapping 
     [5] at the command-response level. The extension template for the 
     contact object is outlined below.  
      
     C: <EPPCommandName> 
     C:  <contact:command 
          xmlns:contact="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:contact-1.0" 
     C:   xsi:schemaLocation="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:contact 
            contact-1.0.xsd"> 
     C:    <!-- One or more contact-specific command elements. --> 
     C:  </contact:command> 
     C:  <extension> 
     C:    <!-- One or more server-defined elements. --> 
     C:  </extension> 
     C:  <trID> 
     C:    <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID> 
     C:  </trID> 
     C: </EPPCommandName> 
      
     S:<response> 
     S:  <result code="1000"> 
     S:    <msg lang="en">Command completed successfully</msg> 
     S:  </result> 
     S:  <extension> 
     S:    <!-- One or more server-defined elements. --> 
     S:  </extension> 
     S:  <trID> 
     S:    <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID> 
     S:    <svTRID>54321-XYZ</svTRID> 
     S:  </trID> 
     S:</response> 
      
     The extensions for the usTLD are accomplished by defining two new 
     elements within the <extension> field. Three EPP commands are 
     affected by the extensions for the contact object. 
      
      
  3. Server-Defined Elements 
      
     Two parameters are defined for conveying information in the 
     <extension> field; AppPurpose and NexusCategory. They are 
     specified as name-value pairs within <extension> as follows:

   New EPP Parameters for the usTLD                       February 2002 
   
   
     <extension> 
     AppPurpose=value 
     NexusCategory=value 
     </extension> 
      
     Here ôvalueö is a character string to be defined in Sections 3.1 
     and 3.2, respectively. When both parameters are present in the 
     <extension> field, they are separated by at least one white space 
     character. 
      
      
     3.1  AppPurpose Parameter 
      
     The AppPurpose (i.e., Application Purpose) parameter specifies the 
     intended usage for the domain name. The set of defined values for 
     this parameter is: 
      
     - ôP1ö: Business use for profit; 
       
     - ôP2ö: Non-profit business, club, association, religious 
        organization, etc.;  
      
     - ôP3ö: Personal use;  
      
     - ôP4ö: Educational purposes;  
      
     - ôP5ö: Government purposes. 
      
      
     3.2   Nexus Parameter 
      
     Qualifying registrants for the usTLD fall into one of the three 
     categories: 
      
     - Nexus Category 1 
         
        A natural person (i) who is a US citizen, (ii) a permanent 
        resident of the US or any of its possessions or territories, or 
        (iii) whose primary place of domicile is in the US or any of 
        its possessions.  
         
     - Nexus Category 2 
         
        An entity or organization that is (i) incorporated within one 
        of the fifty US states, the District of Columbia, or any of the 
        US possessions or territories, or (ii) organized or otherwise 
        constituted under the laws of a state of the US, the District 
        of Columbia or any of its possessions and territories 
        (including federal, state, or local government of the US, or a 
        political subdivision thereof, and non-commercial organizations 
        based in the US.) 
         
     - Nexus Category 3 
         
        A foreign entity or organization that has a bona fide presence 
        in the US or any of its possessions or territories, and that 
        has substantial lawful contacts with, or lawful activities in, 
        the US.

   New EPP Parameters for the usTLD                       February 2002 
   
   
     Nexus information is required for the registrants to ensure that 
     only those individuals or organizations that have a substantive 
     lawful connection to the US are permitted to register for usTLD 
     domain names. 
      
     The NexusCategory parameter specifies the Nexus category or sub-
     category to which the registrant belongs. The set of defined 
     values for this parameter is: 
      
     - ôC11ö: A natural person who is a US Citizen;  
      
     - ôC12ö: A natural person who is a Permanent Resident; 
      
     - ôC21ö: An entity or organization that is (i) incorporated 
        within one of the fifty US states, the District of Columbia, or 
        any of the US possessions or territories, or (ii) organized or 
        otherwise constituted under the laws of a state of the US, the 
        District of Columbia or any of its possessions and territories 
        (including federal, state, or local government of the US, or a 
        political subdivision thereof, and non-commercial organizations 
        based in the US.) 
      
     - ôC31/CCö: a foreign organization that regularly engages in 
        lawful activities (sales of goods or services or other 
        business, commercial, or non-commercial, including not for 
        profit relations) in the United States. The CC equals to the 
        country code of the organization, as defined in ISO 3166 [10]. 
      
     - ôC32/CCö organization has an office or other facility in the 
        U.S., where CC equals to the county code of the organization, 
        as defined in ISO 3166 [10]. 
      
     C11 and C12 are sub-categories of Nexus Category 1. C21 is Nexus 
     Category 2. C31 and C32 are sub-categories of Nexus Category 3. 
      
     Note that the third sub-category of Nexus Category 1, i.e., ôA 
     natural person whose primary place of domicile is in the US or any 
     of its possessions,ö is not qualified to register domain names 
     under usTLD. 
      
      
  4. EPP Commands 
      
     Three EPP commands are involved in the exchange of usTLD 
     parameters between the registry and the registrars. They all apply 
     only to those contact objects that are to be used as registrants 
     for the usTLD domains. 
      
     - <contact:create> command. At the time of creating a contact 
        object for a registrant, usTLD parameters MUST be provided. 
      
     - <contact:update> command. It can be used to modify usTLD 
        parameters in a contact object that has already been created 
        for a usTLD registrant. 
      
     - <contact:info> command. It can be use to retrieve usTLD 
        parameters associated with a contact object for a usTLD 
        registrant.

   New EPP Parameters for the usTLD                       February 2002 
   
   
     Regarding updating the usTLD parameters on a contact object using 
     <contact:update>, the following behaviors are assumed by the 
     registry: 
      
     - If no <extension> field, or only an empty <extension> field 
        such as <extension/> or <extension></extension> is present in 
        the command, no action is taken by the registry. That is, the 
        current value of either usTLD parameters, if exists, remain 
        unchanged. 
    
     - If either parameter is present in the <extension> field of the 
        command as a ôparameter=valueö pair and the value is not null, 
        e.g.,  
         
          <extension>AppPurpose=P1</extension>  
         
        the registry will replace the value of the corresponding 
        parameter in the contact object with the value supplied in the 
        command. 
         
     - If either parameter is present in the <extension> field in the 
        command as a ôparameter=valueö pair and the value is null, 
        e.g.,  
         
          <extension>AppPurpose=</extension>  
         
        the registry will remove the corresponding parameter from the 
        contact object. 
         
     - If either parameter does not appear in the <extension> field of 
        the command, the current value of the parameter, if exists, 
        remain unchanged.  
      
   Please refer to Section 5 for restrictions on update and removal of 
   usTLD parameters for a contact object as registrant of a usTLD 
   domain. 
    
   When a contact object is associated with a usTLD domain, three other 
   EPP commands corresponding to the domain object are also involved: 
   <domain:create>, <domain:update> and <domain:info>. Please see 
   Section 5 below. 
      
  5. Information Checking 
      
     The two new usTLD parameters defined in Section 3 only apply to 
     contact objects as registrants. Other contact objects, such as 
     administrative and billing contacts, do not REQUIRE the provision 
     of such information. 
      
     The intended usage of a contact object is identified when it is 
     associated with a domain object. The two usTLD parameters will be 
     checked by the registry server at the time when a contact object 
     is associated with a usTLD domain object as the registrant.  
      
     Sepcifically, when the contact object is associated with a domain 
     object as registrant in a <domain:create> or <domain:update> 
     command, if AppPurpose or NexusCategory does not exist for the 
     contact object, an EPP result code 2304 "Object status prohibits 
     operation" SHOULD be returned. Moreover, if the value of 
    
  <draft-liu-epp-usTLD-00>       Expires August 2002                 6 
   
   New EPP Parameters for the usTLD                       February 2002 
   
   
     AppPurpose or NexusCategory is not valid, an EPP result code 2306 
     "Parameter value policy error" SHOULD be returned [3]. 
      
     Note that usTLD information checking for a contact object is done 
     only when it is associated with a domain name as registrant, not 
     at the time the contact object is created. It is the role of 
     registrant that stipulates the provision of the two usTLD 
     parameters for the contact object. 
      
     Once a contact object is associated with a registered usTLD domain 
     as registrant, both usTLD parameters MUST be present at all time. 
     A registrar MUST NOT use <contact:update> to remove either 
     parameters, otherwise an EPP result code 2304 "Object status 
     prohibits operation" SHOULD be returned. If the <contact:update> 
     command results in an invalid value for AppPurpose or 
     NexusCategory, an EPP result code 2306 "Parameter value policy 
     error" SHOULD be returned [3]. 
      
  6. Examples

     Here the Nexus information returned indicates that the registrant 
     registered the domain in .usTLD for business for profit and he/she 
     is an US citizen. The <authInfo> element may not be returned if 
     the querying registrar is not the sponsoring registrar.  
      
      
  7. Internationalization Considerations 
   
     The new parameters defined in this document are for usTLD only. 
     They do not introduce any additional international considerations 
     other than those specified for EPP contact object mapping [5]. 
      
      
  8. IANA Considerations 
      
     The new parameters defined in this document do not require IANA 
     registrations. 
   
      
  9. Security Considerations 
      
     The new parameters defined in this document do not provide any 
     other security services or introduce any additional considerations 
     beyond those described in EPP contact object mapping [5]
