1. Introduction

   Certificate Transparency (CT) is a set of mechanisms designed to
   deter, detect, and facilitate remediation of certificate mis-
   issuance [Architecture]. Mis-issuance of certificates by CAs
   motivates the development of CT. This document describes the
   requirements for Certification Authorities (CAs) and Subjects that
   elect to participate as elements of the Certificate Transparency
   (CT) system, focusing on the Web PKI context.

Internet-DraftCT Certification Authority and Subject Requirements
                            November 2015


1.1. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Requirements for a CT-aware Certification Authority (CA)

   A CT-aware CA logs the certificates that it issues. It may benefit
   from CT since relying parties may have greater confidence in the
   validity of such certificates because they are available to be
   observed by Monitors [Monitor-Auditor]. CAs also are the CT elements
   primarily responsible for remediation, i.e., by revoking mis-issued
   certificates.

   A CT-aware CA MUST submit a certificate (or a pre-certificate [6962-
   bis]) to one or more logs selected by the CA. A CT-aware CA submits
   a pre-certificate to a log when it issues a name redacted
   certificate (see Section 4.2 of [6962-bis]), or when it wants to
   embed a Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT) (see Section 5.6 of
   [6962-bis]) in a certificate that it issues. A CA operating an OCSP
   server MAY elect to provide SCTs to its Subjects via an OCSP
   extension (see Section 8.1.1 of [6962-bis]).

   Figure 1 illustrates interactions between a CA and other elements of
   the CT system.

Internet-DraftCT Certification Authority and Subject Requirements
                            November 2015


2.1. Interaction with a Log

   Most certificates submitted to logs are expected to be end-entity
   certificates, each associated with the Subject (TLS Server) that it
   represents. This includes wildcard certificates, which are EE
   certificates that will match a set of Subject names. These are
   attractive to a Subject because a single certificate can be used to
   represent multiple servers (in subdomains of a single domain name).
   CT-aware CAs MAY issue wildcard certificates, if such issuance is
   consistent with the Certificate Practice Statement of the CA. In
   addition to logging EE certificates, a CA that issues name-
   constrained CA certificates MAY elect to log them (see Section 4.3
   of [6962-bis]).

2.1.1. Logging a (pre-)certificate

   A CA MAY interact with a log to submit a (pre-)certificate to create
   a log entry (see Section 3 of [6962-bis]). The pre-certificate
   capability is offered to facilitate rapid deployment of CT. It has
   the advantage that web sites need not make any software changes to
   acquire one or more SCTs, because the SCTs are embedded in the
   certificate itself. There is, however, a downside of embedding SCTs
   in certificates. If a log that provided an SCT is compromised or
   otherwise becomes not acceptable to browsers and Monitors, the
   certificate associated with that SCT will have to be re-issued with
   a replacement SCT. Thus, in the long term, the options of conveying
   an SCT via the TLS handshake or in an OCSP response (e.g., "stapled"
   into the handshake [RFC6961]), are preferred. However, transmission
   of an SCT via the TLS handshake requires changes to web site
   software to acquire and insert SCTs. Transmission via an OCSP
   response requires that either browsers fetch such responses (which
   appears not to be the norm), or that a web site passes the OCSP data
   via the TLS handshake (and that the OCSP signer be prepared to
   generate this modified form of response).

2.1.2. Name-redacted pre-certificates

   A CA may submit a "name-redacted" pre-certificate to a log. A name-
   redacted pre-certificate includes one or more "?" labels in lieu of
   DNS name components. Name-redaction is a feature of CT designed to
   enable an organization to log certificates without revealing all of
   the DNS name components in the certificate that will be matched to
   the log entry. This is an attractive feature for organizations that
   want to benefit from CT without revealing internal server names as a
   side effect of logging. An end-entity certificate that is to be
   treated as logged via this mechanism MUST contain a critical

                            November 2015


   (X.509v3) extension that indicates which labels have been redacted
   in the log entry. This extension is needed to enable TLS clients and
   Monitors to match a received certificate against the corresponding
   log entry in an unambiguous fashion. See Section 4.2 of [6962-bis]
   for a detailed description of name-redaction in the CT context.

2.1.3. Which and How Many Logs to Use

   The CT architecture does not mandate a specific number of SCTs that
   should be associated with a certificate. Browsers and Monitors MAY
   establish requirements for the minimum number of associated SCTs in
   different contexts, but such requirements are outside the scope of
   the CT architecture. The implication of this is that it is up to the
   CA to determine which and how many logs to use for a given
   certificate. In selecting an appropriate set of logs, a CA is trying
   to anticipate which logs will be acceptable to the TLS clients
   (browsers) that will process SCTs. CAs MAY track the sets of logs
   that browser vendors configure into their products to ensure
   appropriate log coverage. A CA also may accept suggestions for logs
   from the Subjects it serves. The CT architecture does not specify
   interfaces or protocols for communication between CT-aware CAs and
   browser vendors or Subjects to acquire this information.

2.2. Verification of Logging

   A CA SHOULD verify the SCT that has been returned for a certificate
   or pre-certificate. (A CA might submit certificates or pre-
   certificates to multiple logs, with the intent to use only a subset
   of the returned SCTs. In this case the CA need not verify SCTs that
   is does not elect to use.) It is RECOMMENDED that a CA verify that a
   pre-certificate or certificate that it has submitted has, in fact,
   been logged. To perform this verification, the CA waits for an
   interval dictated by the Maximum Merge Delay (MMD) associated with
   the log, and then requests both a Signed Tree Head (STH) and an
   inclusion proof (Section 6.6 of [6962-bis]). The CA SHOULD then
   verify the inclusion proof returned by the log, as described in
   Section 9.4.1 of [6962-bis].

2.3. Monitoring

   It is RECOMMENDED that a CT-aware CA operate a Monitor on behalf of
   its clients. In this context the CA has most of the reference
   information needed to perform the Monitor function (see [Monitor-
   Auditor]). (For Subjects who use only the one CA, the CA has all of
   the information needed; for Subjects who use multiple CAs for the
   same DNS names, each CA would need reference information for all of

Internet-DraftCT Certification Authority and Subject Requirements
                            November 2015


   the legitimate certificates issued by all of the other CAs.) When a
   CA detects a log entry that conflicts with a certificate that it
   issued (and that has not otherwise been authorized by the
   appropriate Subject), the Monitor SHOULD alert the affected Subject,
   so that the Subject can request revocation of the mis-issued
   certificate. The interface used by a CT-aware CA to inform the
   Subject is not specified by this document.

2.4. Remediation

   When a CA is notified that the CA has mis-issued a certificate, the
   CA SHOULD verify that the reporting entity is authorized to make
   this request and that the certificate in question has been mis-
   issued. If authorization and mis-issuance are verified, the CA
   SHOULD revoke and replace the mis-issued certificate. How the CA
   verifies the authorization of the reporting entity is outside the
   scope of the CT architecture. (If the entity that notified the CA is
   the Subject of the mis-issued certificate, the Subject should be
   able to provide evidence that it is the legitimate holder of another
   certificate for the name in question.)

3. Requirements for CT-aware Subjects (TLS web servers)

   Certificate Subjects are major beneficiaries of CT, since legitimate
   certificates issued to them are protected by CT mechanisms.
   Detection of mis-issuance by a Monitor is supported if a
   bogus/erroneous certificate is logged, and if the Subject has
   arranged to have its (legitimate) certificates tracked by one or
   more Monitors. (Ideally, the Subject or its CA logged the legitimate
   certificates, but that is not strictly required for a mis-issued
   certificate to be detected by a Monitor.) A Subject is responsible
   for requesting revocation (to effect remediation) when it is alerted
   to mis-issuance of a certificate with a Subject or Subject
   Alternative names associated with the Subject. Alerting is performed
   by the Monitor function, but a Subject may act as a self-Monitor.
   Finally, Subjects are responsible for conveying SCTs [6962-bis] to
   browsers, e.g., transmitting them using a TLS handshake extension,
   via an OCSP extension, or via embedding in the certificate for the
   web site. (See Section 7 of [6962-bis] for details on SCT
   transmission.)

   Figure 2 illustrates interactions between a Subject and other
   elements of the CT system.

      Figure 2 Interactions between Subject and other elements of CT

3.1. Logging a Certificate

   A CT-aware Subject (e.g., a web site operator) MAY submit its
   certificate(s) to a log, and acquire an SCT for each certificate it
   submits, using the add-chain log interface (see Section 6.1 of
   [6962-bis]). There are three reasons for a Subject to log its own
   certificate(s): (1) its CA did not embed an SCT in the
   certificate(s) it issued to the Subject, (2) the Subject wants to
   acquire SCTs from additional logs, or (3) the Subject wants the
   flexibility offered by conveying SCTs (from logs of its choosing) in
   the TLS handshake (including via OCSP). Section 7 of [6962-bis]
   describes the requirements imposed on Subjects (TLS Servers) for
   delivery of SCTs to CT-enabled TLS clients.

3.2. Verification of Logging

   When a Subject has acquired an SCT, it SHOULD perform the same
   checks described for a CA (see Section 2.2 above), to verify that
   the log has created an entry for each submitted certificate.

Internet-DraftCT Certification Authority and Subject Requirements
                            November 2015


3.3. Monitoring

   It is RECOMMENDED that every CT-aware Subject either perform self-
   monitoring, or become a client of a third-party Monitor (see
   [Monitor-Auditor] for details). In the self-monitoring context, log
   entries of interest are ones that contain a Subject or Subject
   Alternative Name (SAN) associated with the Subject's web site(s).
   (Name-constrained CA certificates and wildcard certificates also
   have to be examined to detect certificates that would match the end-
   entity certificates associated with a Subject's web sites.) Whenever
   a certificate of interest is detected, the Subject compares it with
   the public key information associated with the Subject's
   certificate(s). If there is a mismatch, this indicates that this
   logged certificate was mis-issued. The means by which a Subject
   determines which set of logs to watch is outside the scope of the CT
   specifications. Although the CT architecture does not limit the
   number of logs that may exist, it is anticipated that there will be
   a small number of logs that are widely used. If this model is
   adopted, the metadata for these logs will be available from browser
   vendors [Browsers], and thus should be available to Subjects that
   elect to act as their own Monitors.

3.4. Remediation

   If certificate mis-issuance is detected by or reported to the
   Subject, the Subject contacts the CA that issued the certificate
   (using the Issuer name in the certificate), and requests revocation
   of the mis-issued certificate, to resolve the problem. (The means by
   which a Subject determines how to contact a CA based on the issuer
   name is outside the scope of this specification.) The Subject may
   also contact browser vendors and ask that they put the certificate
   on a blacklist of mis-issued certificates or put the issuing CA's
   certificate on a bad-CA-list.

4. Security Considerations

   CT is a system created to improve security for X.509 public key
   certificates, especially in the Web PKI context. The attack analysis
   in [draft-trans-threat-analysis] examines the types of attacks that
   can be mounted against CT, to effect mis-issuance, and how CT
   addresses (or fails to address) each type of attack. That analysis
   is based on the architecture described in [Architecture], and thus
   readers of this document are referred to that one for a thorough
   discussion of the security aspects of CT. Briefly, CT logs represent
   a viable means of deterring semantic mis-issuance of certificates.
   Monitors are an effective way to detect semantic mis-issuance of

   logged certificates [Monitor-Auditor]. The CT architecture enables
   certificate Subjects to request revocation of mis-issued
   certificates, thus remedying such mis-issuance. Residual
   vulnerabilities exist with regard to some forms of log and Monitor
   misbehavior, because the architecture does not include normative
   means of detecting such behavior.  The current design also does not
   ensure the ability of Monitors to detect syntactic mis-issuance of
   certificates. This is because provisions for asserting the type of
   certificate being issued, for inclusion in an SCT, have not been
   standardized.
