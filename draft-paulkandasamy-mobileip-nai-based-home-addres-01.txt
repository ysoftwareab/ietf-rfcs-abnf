                   NAI-Based Home Address Assignment     January, 2006 
  
  
  
 1. Problem Statement 
     
    With the introduction of NAIs for identifying Mobile Nodes, RFC 
    2794 also enabled the Home Agents to be able to assign IP addresses 
    to Mobile Nodes during their initial registration. Though the 
    concept of NAI-based home address assignment is referenced in both 
    RFC 2794 and RFC 3344, a comprehensive procedure for achieving such 
    a NAI-based home address assignment has not been outlined. More 
    particularly, the Home Agent and Mobile Node behaviors including 
    the error recovery mechanisms for various scenarios related to  
    NAI-based home address assignment have not yet been specified as 
    described below. 
     
       -  Home Agent and Mobile Node behaviors during various error 
          scenarios have not been clearly specified. RFC 2794 allows 
          the mobile node to send a registration request with the NAI 
          extension and with a non-zero home address. In this scenario, 
          the home agent behavior is undefined for the case where it is 
          unable to assign that requested home address. For example, 
          whether the home agent should return a error code informing 
          that it cannot assign the requested home address or whether 
          the home agent can assign an alternative address and return 
          it in the reply. 
     
          Another example could be the scenario where the home agent 
          reboots after a mobile node successfully registered and then 
          the home agent receives a re-registration from the mobile 
          node. For the home agent, this request is indistinguishable 
          from an initial request as mentioned in the paragraph above. 
          In this case, if the home agent is unable to assign the home 
          address in the request, there are no error codes or 
          provisions that the HA can use to inform the MN that the 
          address assignment failed for the requested home address, but 
          it might still be able to assign a new home address. 
     
        -  Home Agent and the Mobile Node behaviors during the 
          re-registration and deregistration scenarios have not been 
          clearly outlined for the case where the mobile node obtained 
          the home address using NAI-based home address assignment. For 
          example, whether the NAI extension is mandatory in re-
          registrations or deregistrations, or whether the home address 
          field in the re-registrations and deregistrations can be 
          0.0.0.0. 
     
        -  Other details like what should be the IP Destination Address 
          of the first successful registration reply forwarded by the 
          foreign agent to the mobile node in the case of a dynamic

                   NAI-Based Home Address Assignment     January, 2006 
  
          home address assignment has not been specified. According to 
          RFC 3344 (section 3.7.2.3), the foreign agent should set the 
          IP Destination Address of a successful reply to the mobile 
          node's home address. But in the case of NAI-based home 
          address assignment, the mobile node might not be knowing its 
          home address till it gets the first successful registration 
          reply and so it might not be able to receive the packet if 
          the IP Destination Address was set to its home address. 
     
    This document specifies a procedure that the Mobile IP entities 
    should follow in order to facilitate NAI-based home address 
    assignment under various circumstances like those mentioned above. 
     
 2. Proposed Solution Overview 
     
    In this procedure, the mobile node can request dynamic home address 
    assignment, by appending the NAI extension [1] to the registration 
    request along with the Dynamic Home Address extension (defined in 
    section 5 and hereafter referred to as the Dynamic-HoA) and by 
    setting the home address field to 0.0.0.0 or to a particular 
    address (as a hint) that it prefers to be assigned. 
     
    If the home address field is 0.0.0.0 and the request has a NAI 
    extension as well the Dynamic-HoA extension, indicating that the 
    mobile node is capable of dynamic home address assignment, then the 
    home agent tries to assign a new address for the mobile node and 
    return a reply with the home address field containing the assigned 
    address. If the home agent is unable to assign an address, it 
    rejects the request with the code ADDR_ALLOC_FAILED. 
     
    If the home address field is non-zero and the request has a NAI 
    extension as well as the Dynamic-HoA extension, indicating that the 
    mobile node is capable of dynamic home address assignment, the home 
    agent tries to assign the requested address specified in the home 
    address field and return the same address in the reply. If the home 
    agent is unable to assign the requested address, the home agent 
    tries to assign an alternative address and return the alternative 
    address in the reply. If the home agent is unable to assign an 
    alternative address, it rejects the request with the code 
    ADDR_ALLOC_FAILED.  
     
    In all the above cases, if the registration request does not 
    contain the Dynamic-HoA extension, the HA behaves according to the 
    RFC 2794 and RFC 3344.

 4. Requirements and Scope 
  
    Following are the requirements that the proposed NAI-based home 
    address assignment scheme tries to satisfy. 
     
       -  Allow the MN to request a particular address to be assigned 
          as the home address. This allows the MN to continue using its 
          old address across a HA reboot. 
     
       -  Specify that re-registrations MUST have the NAI extension, if 
          the initial registration had one. Also, the re-registrations 
          MUST have the assigned home address in the home address 
          field, unless the MN rebooted. 
     
       -  Specify the HA/FA/MN behavior for the scenarios where the HA 
          rebooted and/or the MN rebooted after the MN was successfully 
          registered. 
     
       -  Specify a unique error code for the HA to return in the 
          registration reply, when NAI-based home address assignment 
          fails, which will allow the MN to resort to an appropriate 
          error recovery mechanism. 
     
       -  Allow the HA to simultaneously support MNs that support the 
          NAI-based home address assignment procedure described in this 
          document as well as the MNs that don't. (Backward 
          Compatibility) 
           
       -  MN that returns back to its home network is outside the scope 
          of this document and should be covered in the specific 
          address management specification (e.g. DHCP). 
     
       -  NAI-based home address assignment involving a legacy FA is 
          outside the scope of this document. 
  
 5. The Dynamic Home Address Extension

                   NAI-Based Home Address Assignment     January, 2006 
  
    This extension, also referred to as the Dynamic-HoA, is a skippable 
    extension, included by the MN to inform the home agent that the MN 
    is capable of the dynamic home address assignment procedure 
    outlined in this document. This extension follows the Type-Length-
    Value extension format as defined in [2].  
     
     
     0                   1             
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5  
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |     Type      |   Length      | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
       
       Type         Dynamic-HoA (skippable) 
     
       Length       0 
     
    The Dynamic-HoA extension MUST always precede the  
    authorization-enabling extension between the MN and the HA. 
  
    When this extension is present and the RRQ(HoA) is non-zero, the HA 
    tries to assign the RRQ(HoA) to the MN. If it is unable to assign 
    this requested address, the HA MUST try to allocate an alternative 
    address to the MN and return it in the RRP(HoA). If the HA is 
    unable to assign the requested address or an alternative address, 
    the HA returns a RRP with code ADDR_ALLOC_FAILED and the HoA set to 
    0.0.0.0. 
     
    When this extension is present and the RRQ(HoA) is 0.0.0.0, and if 
    there is an existing binding entry for that MN, then the HA MUST 
    return the home address in the MN's binding entry as the RRP(HoA). 
    If there is no binding entry, then the HA MUST try to assign a new 
    address to the MN and return it in the RRP(HoA). If the HA is 
    unable to assign a address to the MN, the HA returns a RRP with 
    code ADDR_ALLOC_FAILED and the RRP(HoA) set to 0.0.0.0. 
  
 6. The Proposed Scheme 
    
    The following tables summarize the behavior of the HA, FA and MN in 
    various scenarios involving dynamic home address assignment and 
    deregistrations. Each of the cases in the tables are described in 
    detail following each table. 
  
 6.1 Dynamic Home Address Assignment Scenarios 
     
    This table outlines the scenarios involving dynamic address 
    assignment, where the RRQ contains the NAI extension and the 
    Dynamic-HoA extension and the lifetime in the RRQ is non-zero.

    Case 1: 
     
    Scenario    : HA reboots after a MN successfully registered and 
                  then receives a re-registration from the MN. For the 
                  HA, this RRQ is indistinguishable from an initial 
                  RRQ, since there is no binding. 
     
    HA Behavior : The HA MUST try to assign the RRQ(HoA) to the MN, and 
                  if successful, it MUST create the binding entry and 
                  send a successful RRP with HoA == RRQ(HoA).  
     
    FA Behavior : If the Code value in the RRP indicates that the 
                  registration was accepted by the HA, then the FA MUST 
                  create or update the corresponding visitor entry with 
                  HoA == RRP(HoA). 
     
    MN Behavior : If the Code value in the RRP indicates that the 
                  registration was accepted, then the MN starts using 
                  the RRP(HoA).

                  HA is unable to assign the RRQ(HoA) to the MN. 
                      
    HA Behavior : The HA MUST try to assign an alternative address and 
                  if successful, it MUST create a new binding entry and 
                  MUST return a RRP with HoA containing the alternative 
                  address. If the HA is unable to assign an alternative 
                  address, it MUST return a RRP with the code 
                  ADDR_ALLOC_FAILED and RRP(HoA) set to 0.0.0.0. 
     
    FA Behavior : If the Code value in the RRP indicates that the 
                  registration was accepted by the HA, then the FA MUST 
                  create or update the corresponding visitor entry with

                  If the RRP has the code ADDR_ALLOC_FAILED, the FA 
                  just forwards the RRP to the MN without taking any 
                  action. 
                   
    MN Behavior : Same behavior as in Case 1. 
     
    Case 3: 
     
    Scenario    : MN reboots after it was successfully registered and 
                  then tries dynamic home address assignment using 
                  Dynamic-HoA extension with RRQ(HoA) containing the 
                  requested address. 
                      
    HA Behavior : No new behavior. The HA MUST return the Binding(HoA) 
                  in the RRP(HoA).  
     
    FA Behavior : Same behavior as in Case 1. 
     
    MN Behavior : Same behavior as in Case 1.  
     
    Case 4: 
     
    Scenario    : MN reboots after it was successfully registered and 
                  then tries dynamic home address assignment using 
                  Dynamic-HoA extension with RRQ(HoA) containing the 
                  requested address. But the HA has a binding entry for 
                  the MN in its binding list with HoA different from 
                  the RRQ(HoA).  
     
                  This could be the case where the MN has been 
                  configured with a preferred address but was assigned

                  a different address during its previous registration 
                  before the reboot. 
     
    HA Behavior : Same behavior as in case 1. The HA MUST try to assign 
                  RRQ(HoA) to the MN and if successful, it MUST create 
                  a new binding entry and return a RRP with HoA == 
                  RRQ(HoA). 
        
    FA Behavior : Same behavior as in Case 1. 
     
    MN Behavior : Same behavior as in Case 1. 
     
    Case 5: 
     
    Scenario    : Same as case 4, except that the RRQ(HoA) cannot be 
                  assigned to the MN. 
     
    HA Behavior : Same behavior as in case 2.  
     
    FA Behavior : Same behavior as in Case 2. 
     
    MN Behavior : Same behavior as in Case 1. 
     
    Case 6: 
     
    Scenario    : Initial RRQ (No binding in the HA). 
                  MN and HA reboot after a successful registration. 
                      
    HA Behavior : The HA MUST try to assign a new HoA for the MN and 
                  return it in the RRP(HoA). 
     
    FA Behavior : Same behavior as in case 1. 
     
    MN Behavior : If the RRP indicates that the registration request 
                  was accepted and RRP(HoA) is non-zero, then the MN 
                  starts using the RRP(HoA). 
     
    Case 7: 
     
    Scenario    : MN reboots after successfully registering and then 
                  sends a RRQ with the Dynamic-HoA. 
     
    HA Behavior : HA returns Binding(HoA) in the RRP(HoA). 
     
    FA Behavior : Same behavior as in case 1. 
     
    MN Behavior : Same behavior as in case 6.

    This table outlines the deregistration scenarios related to the 
    cases where the address was assigned using the dynamic home address 
    assignment procedure. The HA and the FA MUST follow this procedure 
    only if the deregistration request contains the Dynamic-HoA 
    extension.

    Case 1: 
     
    Scenario    : HA reboots after the MN successfully registered. 
     
    HA Behavior : The HA MUST send a reply indicating the registration 
                  was accepted with RRP(HoA) == RRQ(HoA), since this 
                  will allow the MN to stop using the home address. 
     
    FA Behavior : If the RRP indicates that the RRQ was accepted, the 
                  FA MUST delete the visitor entry corresponding to 
                  RRP(NAI) and RRP(HoA). The FA MUST forward the RRP in 
                  even if there is no corresponding visitor entry.

    Scenario    : Normal deregistration scenario. 
     
    HA Behavior : The HA MUST delete the binding entry with the 
                  matching RRQ(NAI) and RRQ(HoA) depending upon the 
                  value of the care-of address in the RRQ as per RFC 
                  3344. 
     
    FA Behavior : Same as in Case 1. 
     
    MN Behavior : Same as in Case 1. 
     
    Case 3: 
     
    Scenario    : The MN and the HA reboot after the MN successfully 
                  registered and the MN sends a deregistration with 
                  zero HoA. And in this case, the HA does not have any 
                  binding corresponding to the RRQ(NAI). 
     
    HA Behavior : The HA MUST send a RRP indicating the registration 
                  was accepted. 
     
    FA Behavior : If the RRP indicates that the RRQ was accepted, and 
                  the RRP(HoA) is zero, the FA MUST delete all the 
                  visitor entries corresponding to RRP(NAI). The FA 
                  MUST forward the RRP in even if there is no 
                  corresponding visitor entry. 
     
    MN Behavior : No new behavior. 
     
    Case 4: 
     
    Scenario    : The MN reboots after it successfully registered with 
                  the HA and wants the HA to clear all the bindings 
                  corresponding to its NAI. 
     
    HA Behavior : The HA MUST delete all the binding entries 
                  corresponding to the RRQ(NAI). This will enable the 
                  HA to clear the stale binding entries, in case of a 
                  MN reboot. 
     
    FA Behavior : Same as in Case 3. 
     
    MN Behavior : No new behavior. 
  
 7. MN Considerations

                   NAI-Based Home Address Assignment     January, 2006 
  
 7.1 Sending Registration Requests 
  
 7.1.1 Initial Registration Requests 
  
    This section describes the MN considerations for the initial 
    registration case, where the MN is trying to acquire a new home 
    address from its HA. 
     
    A MN following the NAI-based home address assignment procedure 
    specified in this document, MUST append the NAI extension to the 
    RRQ and MUST follow one of the following methods whenever it wants 
    to acquire a new home address: 
     
       -  by sending the RRQ(HoA) as 0.0.0.0 along with the Dynamic-HoA 
          extension. 
     
       -  by sending a preferred address in the home address field 
          along with the Dynamic-HoA extension. 
     
    In the case where the MN is registering via a FA, the MN MUST set 
    the IP Source Address of the RRQ to 0.0.0.0, if it is requesting 
    dynamic home address assignment, even for cases where the MN is 
    sending a non-zero value in the RRQ(HoA) as a hint to the HA. 
     
 7.1.2 Re-registration Requests 
     
    Once the MN successfully obtains a dynamically assigned home 
    address from its HA, it MUST set the home address field to that 
    address and MUST append the NAI extension as well as the Dynamic-
    HoA extension that was included in its last successful 
    registration, in all its subsequent re-registrations. 
  
 7.1.3 Deregistration Requests 
  
    To deregister a specific dynamic address that was obtained using 
    the procedures mentioned in this document, the MN MUST append the 
    NAI extension and MUST set the RRQ(HoA) to that assigned home 
    address. The MN MAY also append the Dynamic-HoA extension from its 
    last successful RRQ. 
     
    In cases like a MN reboot, the MN MAY try to clear the stale 
    binding entries in the HA by sending a deregistration with the NAI 
    extension and with RRQ(HoA) set to 0.0.0.0. In this case, the MN 
    MUST add the Dynamic-HoA extension to inform the HA and the FA to 
    follow the deregistration procedures defined in section 6.2 of this 
    document. 
  
 7.2 Receiving Registration Replies

                   NAI-Based Home Address Assignment     January, 2006 
  
 7.2.1 Validity Checks 
  
    Whenever a MN sends a RRQ with a Dynamic-HoA extension, it SHOULD 
    verify that the corresponding RRP also includes the Dynamic-HoA 
    extension. If the RRP does not have the Dynamic-HoA extension, then 
    the MN SHOULD assume that the HA is incapable of the NAI-Based home 
    address assignment procedure and the MN SHOULD behave as per RFC 
    2794 and RFC 3344. 
  
 7.2.2 Processing Registration Replies 
     
    Whenever a MN sends a registration request, it can receive any of 
    the following type of replies from the HA. 
     
       -  RRQ rejected with code ADDR_ALLOC_FAILED. 
          In this case, the MN's request for dynamic home address 
          assignment has been rejected by the HA. The MN can resort to 
          some error recovery mechanism depending upon the type of RRQ 
          that got rejected. For example, if the dynamic address 
          assignment failed, the MN could try registering using a 
          static address as per the RFC 2794 and RFC 3344. 
     
       -  RRQ accepted with RRP(HoA) == RRQ(HoA). 
          In this case, the MN requested a non-zero home address and 
          the HA was able to assign the same address to the MN. 
     
       -  RRQ accepted with RRP(HoA) != RRQ(HoA) 
          If the RRQ(HoA) was 0.0.0.0, then the HA assigned a new 
          address to the MN. 
     
          If the RRQ(HoA) was non-zero and the RRQ was sent with a 
          Dynamic-HoA extension, then the HA assigned a different 
          address to the MN than the RRQ(HoA). In this case, the MN 
          MUST check for the presence of the Dynamic-HoA extension. 
     
          If this was a re-registration request where the HoA was 
          obtained from a successful reply, then the MN MUST stop using 
          the old address RRQ(HoA) and MUST start using the new address 
          RRP(HoA), since this could be the case where the HA rebooted 
          and cannot allocate the RRQ(HoA) to this MN again. 
     
    In addition to these replies, the MN can also receive registration 
    replies denied by the FA as per section 3 of RFC 2794. 
  
 8. HA Considerations 
  
 8.1 Registration Requests 
  
 8.1.1 Validity Checks 
        
  
 Paulkandasamy & Leung       Expires - July 20, 2006      [Page 13] 
                                    
                   NAI-Based Home Address Assignment     January, 2006 
  
    If the Dynamic-HoA extension is present in the RRQ, it MUST precede 
    an authorization-enabling extension between the MN and the HA. 
    Otherwise the HA SHOULD reject the RRQ with Code 134 (poorly formed 
    request) [2]. The HA MAY choose to ignore such requests, to prevent 
    any possible DOS attacks. 
     
    The HA MUST start the NAI-based home address assignment procedure 
    for a RRQ having a non-zero lifetime value, only after 
    authenticating the MN using an authorization-enabling extension. 
     
    If the RRQ has a Dynamic-HoA extension and the MN is not 
    provisioned for dynamic home address assignment, then the HA MUST 
    reject the RRQ with code 129 (administratively prohibited) [2]. 
  
 8.1.2 Processing Registration Requests 
     
    Upon receiving a RRQ with a non-zero lifetime, the home-agent can 
    provide dynamic home address assignment to the MN. This is the case 
    where the RRQ has the Dynamic-HoA extension. The HA behavior for 
    this case will be as defined in the sections 5 and 6.1. 
     
    The HA behavior in the case of a deregistration will be as defined 
    in section 6.2. 
  
 8.2 Sending Registration Replies 
  
    If the HA is successful in assigning a new address for the MN, then 
    it sends a RRP with the home address field containing the newly 
    assigned address. 
     
    If the HA is denying the request with ADDR_ALLOC_FAILED, then the 
    home address field MUST be set to 0.0.0.0. 
     
    If the RRQ included the Dynamic-HoA Extension and the HA is able to 
    recognize that extension, then it MUST include same extension in 
    the RRP, preceding the authorization-enabling extension between the 
    MN and the HA. On the other hand, if the HA does not recognize the 
    Dynamic-HoA extension, then the HA MUST NOT include this extension 
    in the RRP. This would enable the MN to know whether the HA is 
    capable of NAI-based home address assignment procedure. 
  
 9. FA Considerations 
  
    Upon receiving a RRQ or a RRP with a NAI extension, the FA MUST 
    perform all the applicable validity checks mentioned in section 3 
    of RFC 2794. 
     
    In addition, if the RRQ or the RRP included the Dynamic-HoA 
    extension, the FA MUST follow the procedures mentioned in this 
    document.

                   NAI-Based Home Address Assignment     January, 2006 
  
  
 9.1 Registration Replies 
  
    Whenever the FA is originating a RRP with a FA reject code or 
    forwarding a RRP from the HA to the MN, it MUST set the IP 
    Destination address of the reply to be the IP Source Address of the 
    corresponding RRQ, if it is non-zero. This is because, in the case 
    of NAI-based home address assignment, the FA has no way of knowing 
    if the MN has already started using the RRQ(HoA) or the RRP(HoA). 
    If the IP Source Address of the RRQ is set to 0.0.0.0, then the IP 
    Destination address is set to 255.255.255.255. 
     
    This is because, if the foreign agent set the IP Destination 
    Address of a successful reply to the mobile node's home address as 
    per RFC 3344 (section 3.7.2.3), the mobile node might not be 
    knowing its home address till it gets the first successful 
    registration reply and so might not be able to receive the reply 
    packet. 
  
 10. IANA Considerations 
  
 10.1 Mobile IP Extension Type 
  
    This document introduces the following Mobile IP extension type. 
     
             Name       : Dynamic Home Address extension 
             Type Value : TBD 
             Section    : 5 
     
 10.2 Mobile IP HA Error codes 
  
    This document introduces two error codes that can be returned by 
    the HA in a Mobile IP Registration Reply. 
     
            Name               Value    section first referenced 
            ----               -----    ------------------------ 
            ADDR_ALLOC_FAILED   TBD     2 
          
 11. Security Considerations 
  
    The above mentioned procedure for NAI-based home address assignment 
    introduces the Dynamic-HoA extension which MUST be protected by an 
    authorization-enabling extension [2] between the MN and the HA. 
    Thus, this procedure does not introduce any new security concerns. 
  
 12. Backward Compatibility Considerations 
  
 12.1 Legacy Home Agent

                   NAI-Based Home Address Assignment     January, 2006 
  
    Upon receiving a RRQ from a MN following the procedure outlined in 
    this document, the legacy HA SHOULD follow the behavior as per RFC 
    2794 and RFC 3344 ignoring the Dynamic-HoA extension which has been 
    defined in the skippable range of extensions.  
  
 12.2 Legacy Foreign Agent 
  
    For the cases where the RRQ is sent by the MN with home address 
    field set to 0.0.0.0 or where the RRQ(HoA) is non-zero and is the 
    same as RRP(HoA), the behavior of the legacy FA should be the same 
    as per RFC 2794. 
     
    For the case where the RRQ(HoA) is non-zero and is different from 
    the RRP(HoA) the behavior is implementation dependant, since this 
    case was outlined neither in RFC 2794 nor in RFC 3344. Hence, the 
    scenarios involving a legacy FA operating between a MN and a HA 
    following the NAI-based home address assignment procedure described 
    in this document is outside the scope of this document. 
  
 12.3 Legacy Mobile Node 
  
    The behavior of a legacy MN will not be affected, since the new 
    behavior will be applicable only for RRQs and RRPs which include 
    the Dynamic-HoA extension.
