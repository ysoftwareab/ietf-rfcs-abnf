            A Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace for SCTE
                       draft-dthakore-scte-urn-00

Abstract

   This document describers the Namespace Identifier (NID) 'scte' for
   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) used to identify resources published by
   the Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers (SCTE).  SCTE
   specifies and manages resources that utilize this URN identification
   model.  Management activities for these and other resource types are
   handled by the SCTE.

1.  Introduction

   The SCTE standards program is an ANSI-accredited forum for the
   development of technical specifications supporting cable
   telecommunications.  SCTE standards work includes: data and telephony
   over cable; application platform development; digital video;
   emergency alert systems; network monitoring systems; cables,
   connectors and amplifiers; construction and maintenance practices;
   energy management, and more.

   Occasionally, SCTE specification efforts require identifiers in a
   managed namespace so that they are unique and persistent.  To ensure
   that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration of a specific
   Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace Identifier (NID) for use by
   SCTE is being speified in this document, in full conformance with the
   NID registration process specified in RFC3406 [RFC3406]

2.  URN Specification for SCTE

   Namespace ID:

      scte

   Registration Information:

      registration version number: 1
      registration date: 2016-03-20

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Registering organization

         Name: Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers
         Address: 140 Philips Road, Exton, PA 19341-1318, USA
      Designated contact

         Role: Manager, Standards
         Email: TBD

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the
      "scte" NID will have the following structure:

         urn:scte:{SCTEresource}:{ResourceSpecificString}

      where the "SCTEresource" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the
      URN syntax requirements of [RFC2141].
      SCTE will maintain a naming authority, the SCTE Assigned Names and
      Numbers [SANN] specification, that will contain the assignment of
      SCTE resource classes and the specific registration values
      assigned for each resource class.  This specification will be
      published on the SCTE Standards Program website.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      SCTE publishes information regarding the registered resources in
      the corresponding SCTE standards.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      SCTE will manage resource classes using the "scte" NID and will be
      the authority for managing resources and associated subsequent
      strings.  SCTE is expected to guarantee the uniqueness of the
      strings themselves.

      SCTE could allow the use of experimental type values for testing
      purposes only.  Note that using experimental types may create
      collisions as multiple users may use the same values for resources
      and specific strings.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      SCTE will update the SCTE Assigned Names and Numbers specification
      to document the registered resources that use the "scte" NID.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      SCTE will provide procedures for registration of each type of
      resource that it maintains.  Each such resource may have three
      types registration activities:

   1.  Registered values associated with SCTE documents or services
   2.  Registration of values or sub-trees to other entities
   3.  Name models for use in experimental purposes

   Process of identifier resolution:

      The namespace is not listed with a resolution discovery system;
      this is not applicable for this URN registration.

   Rules for lexical equivalence:

      No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of
      [RFC2141] apply.

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
      implemented in support of SCTE activities.

   Scope:

      Global

3.  Example

   The following example represents a hypothetical URL that could be
   assigned by SCTE.
   urn:scte:dash:2015

   This example defines the URN to be used for for ANSI/SCTE 214-1 2015
   "MPEG DASH for IP-Based Cable Services Part 1: MPD Constraints and
   Extensions"

4.  Namespace Considerations

   SCTE develops specifications that may require the use of data models.
   URN Namespaces are key constructs to manage the definitions of those
   data models reliably with persistence and uniqueness.

   The use of URNs should also help specification authors to maintain
   different versions of URNs and dependencies between URNs across
   different versions of SCTE specifications if they so wish.

5.  Community Considerations

   Participants involved in the development and usage of SCTE
   specifications and cable industry deployments will benefit from the
   publication of this namespace by providing consistent and reliable
   names for the XML namespaces, schema locations, and similar
   identifiers of physical data models published within SCTE
   specifications.

   The SCTE specifications are publicly available and are licensed to
   manufacturers on a nondiscriminatory basis.  SCTE will maintain the
   corresponding specifications where the registered resources are
   referenced or used.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds a new entry ("scte") in the urn-namespaces
   registry.  This is the defining document for the entry.  The entry
   can be found in the Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespaces
   [IANA-URN] Registry.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general,
   which are described in [RFC1737], [RFC2141], [RFC3406]

8.  Acknowledgements

   The authors acknowledge that the text from [RFC6289] formed the basis
   for the initial version of this document.
