  1. 
     Overview  
     
   The European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) is defining 
   a Next Generation Network (NGN) where a substantial part of it is 
   based on the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) defined by the Third-
   Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). IMS is largely based on the 
   Session Initiation Protocol [1].  
        
   ETSI has developed a number of requirements draft-jesske-sipping-
   tispan-requirements [5] to support the usage of SIP in Next 
   Generation Networks that interoperate, at the service level, with the 
   Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), the Integrated Services 
   Digital Network (ISDN), the 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), and 
   SIP networks and terminals that implement the service logic.  
        
   In order to provide full support in SIP of existing services, 
   extensions to SIP are needed.    
   This document proposes the use of the Reason header field in 
   responses and adds a location field where the release was originated. 
   This is needed for creating services that must be interoperable with 
   the PSTN/ISDN network and the interoperability of traversing 
   communications through SIP not using SIP-I. This fulfils the 
   requirement [REQ-GEN-1]  
 
  2. 
     Overall Applicability  
     
   The SIP procedures specified in this document are foreseen for 
   networks providing simulation services and/or interworking to the 
   PSTN/ISDN.

Internet-Draft        Reason Header in Responses          January 2008 
 
 
   The document is describing the use of the Reason header in SIP 
   responses. These procedures are only valuable if the reason contained 
   in the element "protocol" is "Q.850". A inclusion of a SIP reason 
   (protocol="SIP") is not helpful due to the fact that the response 
   already provides the SIP reason. The Release Causes are described 
   within ETSI EN300 485 [5]  
   To provide more information to ISDN devices that are using SIP UA's 
   like a IAD (Integrated Access Devices) as relay for interworking the 
   release location of the call should be included within the Reason 
   Header. Such information is meaningful for scenarios where the user 
   phones to an ISUP network.   
        
  3. 
     Terminology  
     
   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, 
   SHOULD,SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear 
   in this document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 
   [RFC2119].      
    
  4. 
     Procedures  
     
   For providing services and PSTN/ISDN interoperability it MUST be 
   possible to include Reason header fields with Q.850 Cause values. 
     
4.1 
    Procedures at the UA  
     
   A UA that supports the Reason header field can process the Q.850 
   Cause Value and display it or an equivalent text. The inclusion of a 
   Reason header field by UA is only for 2B2 UA interworking with the 
   PSTN/ISDN or providing services foreseen.  
     
4.2 
    Procedures at a SIP proxy  
     
   SIP proxies that receive a response containing a Reason header field 
   is forwarding the response without changing the reason.   
        
   A SIP proxy receiving a request that includes a Reason header field 
   can route the request to an application server for further analysis 
   and base services on it.   
        
   Based on network policy a Proxy can remove a Reason header field send 
   from a UAC.  
     
4.3P
    rocedures at an application server  
     
   An application server that receives a SIP request that contains a 
   response including a Reason header MAY analyze the SIP Reason and 
   base further procedures on this analyses.

   For Example the application server could use the reason for sending a 
   announcement towards the originating entity of the Session.   
        
   As an example the Anonymous Communication Rejection (ACR) service 
   defined by ETSI Telecommunications and Internet converged Services 
   and Protocols for Advanced Networking (TISPAN)      
    
  5. 
     Procedures at an interworking point with ISUP 
   For interoperability reasons the Q.850 Cause Value and the Location 
   of a Release shall be mapped to the Reason Header.

     Security Considerations  
  
   The presence of the Reason header in a response does not affect the  
   treatment of the response.  
   Including such a header by an untrusted entity could adulterate the  
   reactions of the originating entitys. E.G. sending back a cause value  
   "87" can cause an announcement within the PSTN/ISDN saying that the  
   call was rejected due to the Closed User Group service.   
   Therefore it is RECOMMENDED to include the Reason header including 
   the location information in Responses only by trusted entities as it 
   is described within RFC3325 [7]  
  
 
  8. 
     IANA Considerations  
 
This document describes the use of the Reason header field described 
   within RFC 3326 [2]. No additional SIP elements are defined within 
   this document. Therefore, this document does not provide any action 
   to IANA.
