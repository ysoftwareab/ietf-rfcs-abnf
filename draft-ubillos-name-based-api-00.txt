Abstract

   Today, networked applications typically make use of name-oriented
   network abstractions.  There is a myriad of application development
   frameworks who provide abstracted APIs allowing applications to refer
   to their peers by name.  These abstractions normally only provide
   application-layer protocol functionality.  They are normally uni-
   lateral solutions, the support for the protocol used is implied by
   the service accessed on the remote peer(s).

   We suggest a unified API for networked applications.  Isomorphic to
   the existing name-based solutions, but with added network-related
   functionality.  Providing an existing application-layer protocols
   with network features such as mobility, multi-homing, IPv4/IPv6
   interoperability, NAT-traversal and so on...

1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   Locator - A topological address with which a host can be reached.
   E.g.  IPv4/IPv6 or MAC-addresses.

   Multi-home - A host which is reachable through multiple locators.

   Name - Something with which a host (or service) can be named.  E.g. a
   FQDN, a peer-id in a DHT or any other structure from.

3.  Motivation

   Applications and application-frameworks today typically deal with
   locators directly.  The resolution: name -> locator is done by
   directly by the application or it is done framework (e.g.  Java).
   This severely limits the functionality the operating system may
   provide.

   The alternative is using shim-layer solutions, where the OS presents
   a pseudo-address to the application and deals with locator management
   internally in the network-layer

4.  Name-based API

   An API which allows the applications or application-frameworks to
   address their peers by name in a simple manner still providing the
   interface parts required to leverage the network functions.  It
   should be complete but as far as possible be optional.

   Where the actual translation to locators should happen is an open
   question, and it seems likely that this should be a variable.
   Comparable how BSD sockets may vary its 'layer' by e.g.  SOCK_STREAM/
   SOCK_DGRAM, SOCK_RAW with or without setsockopt(HDRINCL).

5.  Bi-lateral requirements

   I the application-frameworks today, the common element between peers
   is the service used.  This implies the application protocol used.
   For network based functions a mechanism to check for support at the
   remote peer is needed.  This function should be backwards compatible.
