   Abstract 
    
   This document describes the use of CR-LDP [CRLDP] to establish 
   backup LSP tunnels for local repair of LSP tunnels established by 
   CR-LDP. 
    
   This document proposes extensions to existing CR-LDP for setting up 
   backup tunnels for protecting LSPs on an exclusive bandwidth basis 
   or shared bandwidth basis as desired by the initiator of the tunnel 
   at the head end node. Several backup segments are maintained for a 
   single LSP and they are meant to provide link and node failure 
   protection along various segments of the LSP. Sharing of backup 
   segments across multiple LSPs is also facilitated to achieve 
   scalability 
    
   1. Introduction 
    
    MPLS serves as a high speed switching mechanism which leverages 
   existing layer 2 protocols with popular layer 3 routing protocols 
   and serves to establish a common control and management plane. High 
   availability, fault tolerance and failure recovery are expected out

   of MPLS solutions. CR-LDP is an extension to LDP[LDP] for 
   establishing traffic engineered LSPs across the network to meet the 
   needs of real-time applications and QoS conscious applications. The 
   need for quick responses to failures and recovery from such failures 
   is all the more important in such a scenario. Several solutions and 
   approaches have been proposed for providing protection and recovery 
   for MPLS CR-LDP tunnels in [MPLS-FRR], [CRLDP-PP]. 
    
   This document describes the use of CR-LDP [CRLDP] to establish 
   backup LSP segments to take over traffic while local repair is in 
   progress for LSP tunnels. These backup segments exists across 
   sections of the LSP protecting it selectively against node and link 
   failures. These backup segments have the provision to be shared 
   across multiple LSPs traversing the protected set of links and 
   nodes, thus providing a scalable solution. Exclusive bandwidth 
   protection, Shared bandwidth protection and protection without 
   bandwidth guarantee are the options proposed in this document. By 
   the term LSP we mean an explicitly routed LSP with or without 
   bandwidth constraints. 
    
   In order to meet the needs of real-time applications such as voice 
   and video, in case of failure, it is required to re-direct such 
   traffic onto alternate paths in a few milliseconds. Since the local 
   repair mechanism cannot compute and establish an alternate path in 
   such a short time back up tunnels are used to take over the traffic 
   in the intervening time. Traffic will not be lost or delayed much 
   due to the latency in the local repair mechanism. Once the backup 
   segments are in place then on failure of a node or link the traffic 
   is switched to the back up tunnel from the point of local repair. 
   The backup segments are intended to cover both node and link 
   failures till the local repair mechanism computes an alternate path 
   for the primary LSP. Since the back up segments operate for a short 
   time they can be chosen to provide shared bandwidth protection or no 
   bandwidth guarantee at all depending on the application requirement 
   and the anticipated time for local repair.

        Local Repair - Techniques used to repair LSP tunnels quickly 
   when a node or link along the LSPs path fails. 
    
        Protected/Primary LSP - An LSP is said to be protected at a 
   given hop if it has one or multiple associated backup segments 
   originating at that hop. 
    
        Backup Segment - An LSP segment that is used to backup up one 
   or more primary LSPs traversing a set of nodes and links  
    
        PLR - Point of Local Repair. The head-end of a backup segment  
    
        MP - Merge Point. The LSR where one or more backup segments 
   rejoin the path of the protected LSP, downstream of the potential  
   failure.  
    
       One to Many backup segment - A backup segment which protects 
   multiple LSPs by bandwidth sharing along its links though the labels 
   for them along the links would be different. The bandwidth of this 
   segment is the highest of bandwidths shared by all individual LSPs. 
    
   3. CR-LDP Extensions 
    
   We propose two additional TLVs, TUNNEL_PROTECT TLV and BACKUP TLV to 
   CR-LDP. The TUNNEL PROTECT TLV has the U and F bit set to 1 .The 
   BACKUP TLV has the U and F bits set to zero. TUNNEL_PROTECT TLV will 
   be used in the Label Request message while the BACKUP TLV will be 
   used in the Label Request message and Label Release message. 
    
   3.1 TUNNEL_PROTECT TLV 
    
   The tunnel protect object is used by the Ingress LSR to indicate 
   that the tunnel needs to be backed up while local repair is in 
   progress. 
        The format of the tunnel protect TLV is given below 
    
     0                   1                   2                   3

      0x00 - Bandwidth protection not needed 
      0x01  - Shared Bandwidth protection needed  
      0x02 -  Exclusive Bandwidth protection needed 
    
   If shared bandwidth protection is desired then tunnels that desire 
   such protection can share bandwidth along the links of the backup 
   segment, else each tunnel should be given exclusive bandwidth in the 
   back up segment.  
    
   Bandwidth protection not needed indicates that backup segments need 
   not have any bandwidth reservation in the back up segment. This and 
   shared bandwidth can be chosen when no bandwidth guarantees are 
   needed for the short time when local repair is going on.

   4. Signaling for Back up Tunnels and Operational Overview 
    
    
   While setting up the LSP tunnel, at the head-end LSR, the TUNNEL 
   PROTECT TLV is sent in the label request message for tunnels which 
   need to be protected/backed up. Each node along the path which 
   recognizes this TLV and is capable of rapidly switching over traffic 
   to backup segments in case of failure initiates the setting up of 
   backup segments, in addition to the usual CR- LDP request message 
   processing. An alternate path is computed by the node and a label 
   request with the BACKUP TLV is sent along the back up path. The 
   BACKUP TLV is constructed at the PLR after the backup segment is 
   computed. The ER TLV that is sent along the back up segment contains 
   hops upto the Merge Point(MP) only, where the protected LSP and 
   backup segments merge.  The list of ER HOPs in the primary LSP is 
   used along with the topology information to compute the merge point. 
   The MP, when it processes the label request, recognizes that it is 
   the end of a back up segment and merges it with the 
   primary/protected LSP whose LSPID is present in the LSPID TLV.  The 
   BACKUP TLV is used by the MP to recognize it as a request for 
   setting up the backup segment. This request is not propagated any 
   further. Label mapping is sent towards the PLR when label mapping is 
   received for the primary/protected LSP. Thus the MP will send two 
   label mappings one along the primary LSP and another along the 
   backup segment. The PLR node can distinguish the two mappings as 
   belonging to the primary LSP and backup segment since the requests 
   were sent by itself. In case any of the nodes along the backup 
   segment including the MP do not recognize the BACKUP_TLV an unknown 
   TLV notification must be sent towards the PLR and the backup segment 
   establishment would fail. 
    
   Hence each node along the path would have a backup segment starting 
   from it and ending at a node which is atleast more than one hop away 
   along the PLR, to ensure link and node protection. 
 
   
                [R1]---[R2]----[R3]----[R4]---[R5] 
                          \\           // 
                            [R6]===[R7]   

     
   In the above example, R2 in this case would build a backup segment 
   [R2->R6->R7->R4]. The doubled lines represent this segment. The 
   backup tunnel for [R1->R2->R3->R4->R5] again rejoins the original  
   path at R4. R2 is the PLR and R4 the MP. 
    


Vijayanand C                 October 2002                    [page 6 ]

     Similarly there would be backup segments across R1 to R3 and R3 to 
   R5. That is, every node along the path that recognizes the TUNNEL 
   PROTECT TLV initiates a backup segment.  
    
   Multiple back-up segments of the same LSP could merge into a single 
   backup segment if paths computed by nodes on the same primary LSP 
   for the same primary LSP have links in common. The common nodes 
   start from a node on the backup segment called the point of backup 
   merger upto the MP with the primary LSP. The nodes recognize this 
   and propagate only a single label request from the point of backup 
   merger of the backup segments. For this, the path from the point of 
   backup merger to the merge point with the primary LSP should be 
   exactly same in the ER HOP TLV, otherwise merging should not be 
   done. In this case when the mapping message arrives at the point of 
   backup merger in the backup segment it sends out two label mappings 
   towards each of the PLR nodes upstream. 
    
                [R1]---[R2]----[R3]----[R4]---[R5]---[R6] 
                         \\      \\          // 
                          [R7]=== [R8]=== [R9]    
    
   In the above example, the backup segments from R2 and R3 have R5 as 
   the MP as per the computation done by them. The two backup segments 
   merge at R8.Hence R8 is the point of backup merger, while R5 is the 
   MP with the primary LSP. 
    
   Another scenario for merger occurs in the back up path when two 
   different tunnels requesting shared bandwidth protection have links 
   in common from point of backup merger in back up path to merge point 
   with primary LSP. The flags field in the BACKUP TLV, will be used to 
   determine whether sharing can be done from point of backup merger in 
   the backup segment. In this case, since shared bandwidth protection 
   is desired, the higher of the bandwidths is used. However  
   different label request messages have to be propagated to maintain 
   the identity of the individual LSPs. This results in a scenario 
   where LSPs share bandwidth. This choice is useful because the backup 
   tunnels operate for a very short time when local repair of primary 
   LSP is in progress. This results in a one to many backup segment 
   because the bandwidth in the backup segment is shared by multiple 
   primary LSPs. 
    
   When there is a node or link failure the traffic is immediately 
   switched to the backup segment at the PLR even while the local 
   repair mechanism is initiated in the PLR. Thus the traffic is not 
   lost/delayed because of the computation and set up latency of the 
   local repair mechanism. 
    
   When the local repair mechanism completes, the primary LSP is 
   complete once again. Let this be called as the new primary LSP.

   Traffic is switched back to the new primary LSP from the backup 
   segment. The repaired segment of the new primary LSP would traverse 
   a different set of links and nodes compared to the failed segment. 
   Hence the new primary LSP segment needs to be protected. For this, 
   the existing backup segment is first released. The release is 
   initiated by the PLR. The release message contains the BACKUP TLV to 
   indicate that it is for the back up segment. The MP uses the BACKUP 
   TLV to identify that the release is for the back up segment. After 
   the backup segment is released a new backup segment is initiated by 
   the PLR and established as described earlier. 
    
   When a primary LSP is released from its head end via a release 
   message, each of the PLR nodes which have initiated back up segments 
   have to release the back up segments in addition to the primary 
   segments by means of release message along the backup segments. 
   These release messages contain BACKUP TLV in addition to the usual 
   list of TLVs. 
    
   If the LSP is torn from a node downstream of MP, by means of 
   withdraw messages, each of the MPs long the path back to the head-
   end propagate withdraw to both the primary and back up segments. 
   There is however, no need for the BACKUP TLV in the withdraw message 
   as the PLR can identify the back up segment.  
    
   In case a failure occurs along the backup segment, the existing 
   backup segment is torn down by withdraw and release messages from 
   the point of failure. The PLR then reinitiates a new backup segment.  
    
   Label mapping and withdraw messages sent on the back up segment from 
   the MP to the PLR should not be propagated towards the head end by 
   the PLR  
    
   5. Back up Path Computation 
     
   Back up path computation is done by the PLR taking the following 
   aspects into consideration (apart from the usual CRLDP constraints 
   parameters): 
    
   - Whether shared or exclusive bandwidth protection is needed. If 
   shared bandwidth reservation is only needed then bandwidth used by 
   existing shared bandwidth LSPs can be re-used. This involves 
   knowledge of existing LSPs, which are open to sharing bandwidth in 
   their back up paths. 
    
   - The hop count limit for the back up segment. The hop count of the  
   segment computed should be within the specified path count limit 
    
   - The backup segment should provide link and node protection for 
   atleast one node and one link.

   - The list of ER HOPS in the label request for the primary LSP needs 
   to be taken into account so that the backup segment does not deviate 
   too much from the requested ER HOPs. 
    
   The algorithm used for this computation is outside the scope of this 
   document. 
    
   6. Interoperability Considerations 
    
   The PLR nodes, the merge point nodes and all nodes along the back up 
   tunnel must recognize this extension to CRLDP in order to provide 
   this feature. Nodes in the primary LSP which donot support this 
   feature will ignore the additional TLVs and silently forward them 
   since the U and F bits are set in the TUNNEL PROTECT TLV. This will 
   result in they not being part of any back up paths established as 
   per this document.  
    
   7. Open Issues 
    
    Rapid Notification of failure to the PLR node is outside the scope 
   of this document and may affect the effectiveness of this solution
