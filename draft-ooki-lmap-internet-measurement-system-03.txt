Abstract

   This document describes an experience of Japanese Internet
   measurement system to measure end-to-end performance of user's
   experience.  We have developed the system toward the enhancement of
   the network performance in an ISP since October 2013.  The systems
   and the considerations about the Internet measurement are introduced
   along with our current status.  This document is expected to be
   useful for the standardization of Internet measurements.

1.  Introduction

   In Japan, it is common to use a high speed Internet such as 100Mbps
   and 1Gbps as an ISP's customer connection.  Users only know the
   maximum bandwidth of the last one mile for the ISP connection.  The
   maximum bandwidth value is ranging from 100Mbps to 2Gbps in ISP's
   price plan as a FTTH connection.

   Of course the end-to-end performance of actual Internet connection is
   below the bandwidth value.  Internet users can obtain actual
   performance depends on various ISP conditions such as congestions.
   Internet users don't know the performance of the actual network.

   On the other hand, ISPs also don't know the quality that Internet
   users experience.  For the ISP's point of view, it is important to
   understand the service quality for its customers in order to design
   its network properly.  For this reason, it is necessary to measure
   the actual performance of typical Internet users.

   The Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) working
   group is formed to standardize a large scale measurement system to
   measure broadband network performance.  The current LMAP WG focus on
   the information model, data model language, the protocols in a
   certain ISP network.  However, the LMAP WG does not focus on the
   measurement of the global end-to-end performance at the moment.  We
   believe that either way someday it will be necessary to establish a
   method for the Internet measurement and the standardization of the
   end-to-end performance measurement, that is not closed to a certain
   ISP.

   This document describes the Internet measurement system and our
   considerations for the end-to-end measurement.  Our measurement
   requirements can be useful for LMAP framework.  We have measured the
   end-to-end performance by using Internet measurement system we have
   been operating since 2011.  We expect the experience of our case can
   contribute to the standardizations in LMAP WG and the enhancement of
   network operation from ISP's perspective.

2.  Motivation of Internet Measurement

   The LMAP WG describes some use cases for the Large-scale Measurement
   of Broadband Performance [RFC7536][I-D.deng-lmap-collaboration].
   There are three reasons that we, ISPs, need to measure the end-to-end
   performance of user experience of its access services.

   First, ISPs want to keep the customer satisfaction.  Typically ISPs
   provide the list of maximum bandwidth and the service prices, such as
   the estimated total fee and the discount rate after the result of a
   cash back campaign.  Japanese users select a ISP based on only those
   information without knowing the end-to-end performance results.  The
   poor performance causes the lower customer satisfaction.

   On the other hand, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and
   Communications in Japan discuss the ideal measurement methods of the
   end-to-end performance about the mobile network in the research
   society.  The organization has yet to be discussed fixed network.
   The researchers are planning to measure the mobile network
   performance on the 1,500 measurement points in the main Japanese
   area.  They use the tool Federal Communications Commission developed
   for measurement of the end-to-end performance.  The mobile network

   operator in Japan may be required to publish the actual performance
   in addition to the best effort performance.

   Second, contents providers are beyond the control of ISPs.  The
   traffic volume of Contents Delivery Network (CDN) providers such as
   AKAMAI and LEVEL3 is increasing in the Internet in recent years.  How
   much users are connecting to which contents providers impact the end-
   to-end performance.  ISPs need to understand their behavior to decide
   ISP's strategies and operation.

   Third, we would like to support the public evaluations of ISPs.  Some
   contents service provider e.g., Google or Sandvine[google][sandvine],
   presented the reports about Internet traffic and ISP performance
   based on each criterion recently.  The Google report presents the
   results of multiple ISPs measured in for each locations in USA.
   People in the world can browse the reports on the Internet.  These
   reports will have huge impact on user's choice of the ISP selection.
   We would like to double-check by using our performance data in order
   to confirm whether the reports can be reliable or not.  If we can
   find the difference of the performance results between our data and
   the reports, we might be able to review whether our measurement
   methods are mistaken or not.  It is also better for an ISP to
   investigate and comprehend the status of end-to-end performance
   between ISPs.  So, we have to measure the end-to-end performance by
   ourself.

   Hence, ISPs should measure the end-to-end performances from end users
   to multiple content providers accurately while comparing with other
   ISPs' performance.  Then, ISPs can show a performance of the actual
   network to build brand value compared with other providers.

3.  Framework of Internet Measurement System

   We introduce the framework of Internet Measurement System in this
   section.  The words, such as Measurement Agent, Controller, and
   Collector conforms to the glossary of the LMAP document[I-D.ietf-
   lmap-framework].

3.1.  Measurement Agent

   The MA has the functions that receive instructions from Controller
   Server (described below), performs measurement tasks, and sends the
   measurement results to the Collector Server.

Internet-Draft         Internet Measurement System         December 2015


3.1.1.  Specification of the MA

   We used a Japanese product, called OpenBlocks [plathome], which is
   the Linux box with Dual Core Marvell ARMADA XP 1.33GHz, 1GB SDRAM
   memory.  We selected the box as the MA because of the affordable
   price, software stability, small form factor, flexible functionally,
   and extendability.  The MA needs some CPU power in order to connect
   PPPoE access line and download tens of contents on the Internet.  The
   OpenBlocks stacks CPU enough to archive them.

3.1.2.  Configuration

   We introduce information configured on the MA in this section.

   o  MA's ID

   We have to setup the MA's ID.  The ID has to be a unique among MAs in
   order for Controller server to distinguish MAs.  The information is
   described in the "/etc/hostname" on Linux File System.  The naming
   rule is based on the location of MA, the types of line, and the plan,
   etc.

   On the other hand, MA doesn't have a group ID.  The ID in our
   measurement system is under only Controller Server.

   o  HTTP Get Tasks

   MA automatically gets the measurement tasks from Controller Server
   every five minutes.  MA sends the request about the tasks and
   schedule to Controller Server by HTTP.  Controller Server returns the
   tasks decided based on SCHEDULE Table to the MA.

   o  Convert measurement results

   MA automatically converts from raw data to the type of JSON data.
   JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format.  We selected it as our
   measurement data model language because of readability, simple
   format, and easy data cleaning to analyze the measurement data.  On
   the other hand, the LMAP WG selected YANG Data Model [I-D.ietf-lmap-
   yang].  We need to consider which we should use YANG data model or
   not.  The convert process is executed every one minute.  The
   converted JSON data is written in the measurement result files.  An
   example of JSON data type of the results of wget raw data is as
   follows.

   {"host":"tokyo-xXx01","filename":"tokyo-xXx01_ISP_target_wget_2014120
   3235011.log.ok","result":"ok","line":"2","message":"2014-12-03
   23:50:18 (10.1 MB/s) - `/dev/null' saved [67206439/67206439]"}

   o  Data Collector and Submitting

   MA automatically and efficiently collects and submits the measurement
   data.  To make it realized, we selected the fluentd which is an open
   source data collector, The software lets Collector Server unify the
   data collection and understanding of data.  The reason we selected it
   is that the software is reliable, stable, and simple of
   implementation enough to control hundreds of MAs.  The data
   collecting tool of many products and system in Japan is implemented
   by fluentd.  The above measurement result files are submitted to
   Collector Server by the process as soon as the files are created.  An
   example of the running flutend process is as follows.

   /usr/bin/ruby1.9.1 /usr/local/bin/fluentd --daemon /var/lib/fluent/
   fluentd.pid --user fluent --group fluent --config /etc/fluent/
   fluent.conf --log /var/log/fluent/fluent.log -vv

   o  Self Check

   The MAs check whether the above processes for measurement service are
   down or not on the regular interval.  If a process is down, the MA
   transmits the message about the message logs to Controller Server.

3.1.3.  Location of the MA

   We have distributed MAs on many places all over Japan.  The number of
   locations is approximately 150 in June 2015.  The number of our MAs
   will be increasing in approximately 200 by the end of this year.  MAs
   are located in houses where the residents can respond our requests
   (e.g., not turning off the power to constantly perform the
   measurement) to manipulate the device.

3.2.  Controller Server

   The Controller Server is a Linux server.  The Controller Server has
   the functions to instruct the MAs and receives the HTTP GET requests
   from MAs.  The Controller Server has 3 tables of database implemented
   by MySQL to instruct MAs.

3.2.1.  Control of MAs

   The Controller Server manage MAs by using two tables (MA Table and
   GROUP Table).  A example of the MA Table is as follows.  MA_ID is a
   key identifying MA.  TYPE is a kind of network type.  MODE expresses
   the type of the measurement.IF MODE is 0, it means MA is the
   measurement mode.  The mode is the status that MAs are performing a
   measurement task.  If MODE is 1, it means MA is the maintenance mode.
   The mode is the status that MA stop performing a measurement task.

   In case of MODE 1, the MA automatically connect to Controller Server
   by using ssh protocol.  We can login to the MA of MODE 1 from
   Controller Server and change the configuration.  We can manage the
   behavior for MAs by switching the MODE.

   +-------------+-------+-------+---------+------+--------------------+

                             Table 1: MA Table

   A example of the GROUP Table is as follows.  The GROUP_ID is a key
   record grouping MAs.  MAs are sure to belong one group at least.  MA,
   tokyo-nFh04, belongs to the group-id1.  The GROUP_INFO is the
   remarks.  We can set the information of the group which MAs belong in
   the column

                 +-----------+-------------+------------+
                 |  GROUP_ID |    MA_ID    | GROUP_INFO |
                 +-----------+-------------+------------+
                 | group-id1 | tokyo-nFh04 |  Group 01  |
                 | group-id2 | osaka-nFs01 |  Group 02  |
                 +-----------+-------------+------------+

                           Table 2: GROUP Table

3.2.2.  Control of the Assigned ISP

   We set the information of ISP accounts to assign MAs on the
   Controller Server.  MAs automatically download the information from
   Controller Server.  Of course, assigned ISP account is unique of all
   ISP accounts for the measurements.  The table includes the column of
   multiple assigned information so that the duplicate use does not
   happen.  A example of the ISP Table is as follows.  ASSIGN_ID is a
   key record within the table.  MEASURE_ISP is the service name of ISP.
   ISP_ID is the unique ID to connect to the ISP network.  PASSWORD is
   the password of the ISP_ID.  ASSIGN_STATUS, ASSING_MA, and
   ASSIGN_TIME are the assigned information at that time.  If the
   ASSIGN_STATUS is 1, that means a MA use the ISP_ID.

                            Table 3: ISP Table

3.2.3.  Setting the Measurement Task and Measurement Schedule

   We set the measurement tasks to instruct MAs on the Controller
   Server.  MAs automatically download the task from Controller Server
   by the fixed time.  We need to set a measurement schedule with the
   measurement task at the same time.  A example of the MEASUREMENT
   SCHEDULE Table is as follows.  SCH_ID is a key record within the
   table.  LINE_TYPE is a type of network provided by a network service.
   ISP is a Internet service provider to perform the measurement tasks.
   SCRIPT is the script file of the measurement tasks described by some
   programming languages.  PARAM is a parameter file required for
   performing measurement tasks.  START_TIME is the time when MAs start
   performing a measurement task.  END_TIME is the time when MAs stop
   performing a measurement task.

   +------+--------+--------+----+----------+-------+---------+--------+
   | SCH_ | GROUP_ | LINE_T | IS |  SCRIPT  | PARAM | START_T | END_TI |

3.2.4.  Receiving the Requests

   On the Controller Server, a httpd program is running as a daemon that
   executes continuously in the background to handle requests.  The
   Controller Server returns the appropriate measurement tasks and
   measurement schedules to MAs in response to HTTP GET requests.  The
   MA which complete own measurement task receives a new measurement

   task continuously.  MAs can start performing the next measurement
   tasks continuously.

3.3.  Collector Server

   The Collector Server receives the measurement results from MAs
   through fluentd process.  The fluentd process is running as a daemon
   that executes continuously in the background to handle the
   measurements data.  The details of the measurement results received
   by fluentd process are listed below.

   saved [67206439/67206439]"}

   A example of the directory structure of the stored measurement
   results is as follows.  A MA's measurement result file is created by
   the day.

   /data/MA's-ID/measure_result_MA's-ID.DATETIME.log

   When the Collector Server receives the measurement results, the
   server creates the directory of the MA-ID of MA and the measurement
   result files.  The measurement results are stored in the data
   directory.

3.4.  Architecture

   The architecture of the measurement system is composed of MAs,
   Controller Server, and, Collector Server.

   Figure 1: Architecture of the Internet Measurement System

   We need to import Controller Server the record of MA's configuration
   in MA Table, GROUP Table, and MEASUREMENT SCHEDULE Table before the
   MA is powered on.

   When a MA is powered on, it tries to establish the FTTH access PPPoE
   connection with the ISP.  After obtaining an IP address, it

Internet-Draft         Internet Measurement System         December 2015


   automatically connect the Controller Server and gets the
   configuration by HTTP.  If the value of MODE column in MA Table is 1,
   the MA automatically gets the maintenance mode.  If the value of that
   is 0, the MA automatically gets the measurement mode and start
   downloading the measurement tasks that is configured in MEASUREMENT
   SCHEDULE Table.

   The MA prepares for the measurement tasks, performs the tasks for
   Measurement Target Contents actively, and collects the measurement
   results.

   After the completion of the measurement tasks, the MA sends the
   measurement results to Collector Server using fluentd process. and
   submits the request for downloading the next measurement tasks to
   Controller Server using HTTP.

   When the specification of the LMAP WG's protocol and framework is
   finished, we will deploy the protocol in our measurement system.

4.  Operation of Internet Measurement System

   We introduce the operation of Internet Measurement System we have
   been operating since October 2013 in this section.

4.1.  Measurement Performance Metrics

   The MAs perform only active measurements for Target Contents.
   Examples of the Target Contents include Video Streaming files, OS
   update files, and the test server for performance measurement in a
   local ISP network.

   In our measurements, the measurement performance metrics are as
   follows.

   o  Round Trip Time (RTT)

   This is the response time between the submission of the ICMP echo
   request packet and the reception of the ICMP echo reply packet.  The
   metric can also be regarded as the round-trip delay time.  This is
   measured by the ping command.  We take the min/avg/max time and the
   loss rate based on measuring this metrics one hundred times by the
   measurement task.  An example of the command MAs execute is as
   follows.

   MA-ID $ ping -i 0.05 -c 100 {contents_ip_address}

   o  Hop Count and Network Path




Ooki & Kamei              Expires June 23, 2016                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft         Internet Measurement System         December 2015


   This metric refers to the number of intermediate devices (like
   routers) through which the data must pass between the MA and the
   Target Contents.  This metric is regarded as the network distance
   between the MA and the Target Contents.  This is measured by the
   traceroute command.  Actually, MA submits the ICMP echo requests
   three times.  Afterwards, by checking the hop counts and network
   path, we can find the change of the network routing on the Internet.
   An example of the command MAs execute is as follows.

   MA-ID $ traceroute -nIq 3 {contents_ip_address}

   o  Throughput

   This metric refers to how much data can be transferred from the MA to
   the Target Contents in a given amount of time.  This is regarded as
   the bandwidth.  We can understand how fast we can get the contents
   the on the network.  Currently, this is measured by the wget command.
   A MA receives URL of the measurement targets and start downloading
   the contents using HTTP GET.  When the download is completed, the
   value divided the contents size by the download complete time is
   regarded as the performance metrics of throughput.  An example of the
   command MAs execute is as follows.

   MA-ID $ wget -T 300 -dvO /dev/null {wgetopts} {contents_url}

   In addition to above three performance metrics, we are studying the
   change of destination IP address of the Internet contents distributed
   by some contents service providers.  It is important for ISPs to know
   the mechanism of the contents delivery networks.  MAs resolve some
   FQDN and gets the destination IP address.  We are studying the
   mechanism of the contents delivery networks based on the response
   results.

4.2.  Measurement Target Contents

   The selection of the Target Contents is important for the Internet
   measurement; the type, the length, and the number of the contents.
   We need to measure the representative contents on the Internet.  In
   order to find such contents, we have selected contents based on two
   viewpoints.

   One is the volume of transferred data of network traffic in an ISP.
   We obtained partial traffic data on multiple prefectures in Japan.
   We selected the Target Contents which were higher in the transferred
   traffic volume ranking.  Examples of such target Contents are Youtube
   Video Streaming files and Mac OS update file on AKAMAI and so on.





Ooki & Kamei              Expires June 23, 2016                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft         Internet Measurement System         December 2015


   Second is the number of access to the contents in the Internet.  For
   example, the portal sites such as Google or Yahoo!, etc.  and the
   shopping sites such as Amazon and iTunes, etc.  are always the higher
   in the number of access to the contents in the Internet.

   In another viewpoint, we need to change the target contents according
   to the purpose of analysis.  If our purpose is to measure an event
   traffic, e.g., the download traffic concerning iOS update or the
   access traffic concerning the special winning sale of the
   professional baseball team, etc., we need to measure the related
   contents.

4.3.  Measurement Schedule

   On receiving the measurement tasks from Controller Server, MAs start
   measurement tasks.  MAs used to perform the measurement task by
   thirty minutes.  When the measurement completes, MAs wait the next
   scheduled time and do not perform the next measurement tasks.  On the
   contrary, when the measurement does not complete before the next
   scheduled time, the MA kills the measurement process and moves to the
   next measurement.  The current system in that point is flexible
   because the MA can start the next task as soon as a measurement task
   is completed.  We can collect more kinds of data than before.

4.4.  Applications of Measurement

   Using the data collected by our measurement system we have studied
   how to comprehend and analyze end-to-end performance more accurately
   than ever before.  A example of analysis is the difference of network
   performance between Japanese ISPs, based on the combinations of
   Target Contents, measurement time, and areas.  We took the
   measurement results in consideration to ISP network design and ISP
   operation as a reference information.

   Furthermore, we have studied the analysis method based on the
   combination of our customer feedbacks, remarks on social network
   service, and customer voices on our callcenters in addition to the
   collected measurement data.  As the result of combined analysis, we
   expect to find new and useful knowledge we have never found before.

5.  Issues of Internet Measurement System

   We introduce the issues of Internet Measurement System we have been
   operating in this section.  The issue section is divided into three
   parts: Architecture Issue, Operation Issue, and Security Issue.

Internet-Draft         Internet Measurement System         December 2015


5.1.  Architecture Issue

   o  Scalability

   The Controller Server is connected to receive HTTP GET requests from
   multiple MAs.  This means that the Controller Server needs to process
   as many HTTP GET requests as the number of MAs.  The number of MAs
   can easily grow beyond the number of HTTP GET requests that a
   Controller Server can process.  If we place hundreds of MAs all over
   Japan, we will need to improve the scalability of our system.

   o  IPv6 Support

   IPv6 network is constructed totally independently from IPv4 network.
   Hence, the performance of the IPv6 network is highly likely different
   from that of the IPv4 network.

   Although the IPv6 network is not the majority yet, it is growing.
   NTT EAST and WEST provided only 2.7% in NGN (Next Generation Network)
   on December 2013.  The rate of IPv6 enabled network in Japan is 27%
   in June 2014[IPv6-Promotion Council].  NTT EAST and WEST presented
   the IPv6 support in PPPoE connection on March 2014.  All CPE devices
   for NTT access line already support IPv6 tunneling, allowing users to
   adapt IPv6 easily.

   In order to achieve the broad applicability of our measurement
   results, we will need to investigate the IPv6 performance also.

   o  Data Reliability

   We need many kinds of data in order to improve the reliability of
   data analysis.  If there are many kinds of data, the reliability of
   our analysis results will be improved and the analysis results might
   be statistically significant.  We need to develop the architecture to
   collect as many different types data as possible.  When a MA
   completed all the instructed measurement tasks, we are creating the
   measurement system that the MA performs other measurement tasks being
   high priority as soon as possible when a MA completed all the
   instructed measurement tasks.

5.2.  Operation Issue

   o  Selection of the Products as Measurement Agent

   We used a Japanese product, called OpenBlocks.  However, some issues
   happen by using this product.  The product sometimes generates high
   heat (e.g., a certain hot day).  The heat is hot enough to feel like
   getting burned.  In fact, the maximum degree of the heat reaches



Ooki & Kamei              Expires June 23, 2016                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft         Internet Measurement System         December 2015


   about eighty degrees Celsius.  Some people were afraid to set up MA
   in their house.  We are looking for more efficient product satisfying
   our requirements than this model.

   o  Selection of Measurement Target Contents

   It is difficult to decide what contents should be measured to present
   the representative performance.  There are many kinds of contents on
   the Internet.

   This time we have selected the Target Contents based on the volume of
   transferred data at some points in an ISP.  However, there are more
   metrics to consider, such as the number of accesses to that contents,
   rather than the transferred volume.  Other metrics are not studied in
   this document.

   o  Stable Operation

   We had experiences where the measurement results were not sent
   immediately, and the measurements for some Target Contents were
   failed.  Although the actual causes of these difficulties vary (e.g.,
   accidentally disconnected LAN cable or power cable), we could easily
   respond to those issues using informations (e.g., time and place)
   contained in the centralized logs in the Collector Server.  Another
   difficulty is the change in the settings of the contents provider.
   For example, wget command for a video content has not worked due to a
   change in a setting in the contents provider.  This issue is
   difficult to tackle and is left for future work.

5.3.  Security Issue

   o  Measurement between ISPs and CSPs

   If we continuously measure the performance about the contents in the
   Internet, from the point of the contents service provider, it can be
   obstacle to provide the stable service due to the traffic volume for
   measurement.  However, we need real situations for the customer to
   measure the performance as correctly as possible.  The service
   provider may request the limitation, e.g., volume and the number of
   access, for measurement to MA.  In terms of the combination between
   ISPs and CSPs, we may need the condition for measurement.

   o  DDoS Attack

   We placed approximately 150 MAs all over Japan.  These MAs may become
   DDoS attackers by wrong commands from the Controller Server.  From
   this reason, the list of commands MAs can perform should be
   restricted.  And also, the MAs must deny illegal accesses and logins.

Internet-Draft         Internet Measurement System         December 2015


   MAs should permit only access through instruction from the Controller
   Server.

6.  Security Considerations

   As described in Setion 5.3, security consideration for Internet
   measurement must be considered.

7.  IANA Considerations

   No need to describe any request regarding number assignment.
