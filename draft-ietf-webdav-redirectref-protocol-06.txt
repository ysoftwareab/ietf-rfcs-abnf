Abstract

   This specification defines redirect reference resources.  A redirect
   reference resource is a resource whose default response is an HTTP/
   1.1 302 (Found) status code, redirecting the client to a different
   resource, the target resource.  A redirect reference makes it
   possible to access the target resource indirectly, through any URI
   mapped to the redirect reference resource.  There are no integrity
   guarantees associated with redirect reference resources.

   Distribution of this document is unlimited. Please send comments to

Internet-Draft    WebDAV Redirect Reference Resources       October 2003


1. Introduction

   This is one of a pair of specifications that extend the WebDAV
   Distributed Authoring Protocol to enable clients to create new access
   paths to existing resources.  This capability is useful for several
   reasons:

   URIs of WebDAV-compliant resources are hierarchical and correspond to
   a hierarchy of collections in resource space.  The WebDAV Distributed
   Authoring Protocol makes it possible to organize these resources into
   hierarchies, placing them into groupings, known as collections, which
   are more easily browsed and manipulated than a single flat
   collection. However, hierarchies require categorization decisions
   that locate resources at a single location in the hierarchy, a
   drawback when a resource has multiple valid categories. For example,
   in a hierarchy of vehicle descriptions containing collections for
   cars and boats, a description of a combination car/boat vehicle could
   belong in either collection. Ideally, the description should be
   accessible from both. Allowing clients to create new URIs that access
   the existing resource lets them put that resource into multiple
   collections.

   Hierarchies also make resource sharing more difficult, since
   resources that have utility across many collections are still forced
   into a single collection. For example, the mathematics department at
   one university might create a collection of information on fractals
   that contains bindings to some local resources, but also provides
   access to some resources at other universities.  For many reasons, it
   may be undesirable to make physical copies of the shared resources on
   the local server: to conserve disk space, to respect copyright
   constraints, or to make any changes in the shared resources visible
   automatically. Being able to create new access paths to existing
   resources in other collections or even on other servers is useful for
   this sort of case.

   The redirect reference resources defined here provide a mechanism for
   creating alternative access paths to existing resources.  A redirect
   reference resource is a resource in one collection whose purpose is
   to forward requests to another resource (its target), possibly in a
   different collection.  In this way, it allows clients to submit
   requests to the target resource from another collection.  It
   redirects most requests to the target resource using the HTTP 302
   (Found) status code, thereby providing a form of mediated access to
   the target resource.

   A redirect reference is a resource with properties but no body of its
   own.  Properties of a redirect reference resource can contain such
   information as who created the reference, when, and why. Since

Internet-Draft    WebDAV Redirect Reference Resources       October 2003


   redirect reference resources are implemented using HTTP 302
   responses, it generally takes two round trips to submit a request to
   the intended resource.  Servers are not required to enforce the
   integrity of redirect references.  Redirect references work equally
   well for local resources and for resources that reside on a different
   server from the reference.

   The remainder of this document is structured as follows: Section 3
   defines terms that will be used throughout the specification.
   Section 4 provides an overview of redirect reference resources.
   Section 5 discusses how to create a redirect reference resource.
   Section 6 defines the semantics of existing methods when applied to
   redirect reference resources, and Section 7 discusses their semantics
   when applied to collections that contain redirect reference
   resources. Sections 8 through 10 discuss several other issues raised
   by the existence of redirect reference resources.  Sections 11
   through 14 define the new headers, properties, and XML elements
   required to support redirect reference resources.  Section 15
   discusses capability discovery.  Sections 16 through 18 present the
   security, internationalization, and IANA concerns raised by this
   specification. The remaining sections provide a variety of supporting
   information.

2. Notational Conventions

   Since this document describes a set of extensions to the WebDAV
   Distributed Authoring Protocol [RFC2518], itself an extension to the
   HTTP/1.1 protocol, the augmented BNF used here to describe protocol
   elements is exactly the same as described in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC2616]. Since this augmented BNF uses the basic production rules
   provided in Section 2.2 of [RFC2616], these rules apply to this
   document as well.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. Terminology

   The terminology used here follows and extends that in the WebDAV
   Distributed Authoring Protocol specification [RFC2518]. Definitions
   of the terms resource, Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), and Uniform
   Resource Locator (URL) are provided in [RFC2396].

   Redirect Reference Resource

      A resource created to redirect all requests made to it, using 302
      (Found), to a defined target resource.

   Non-Reference Resource

      A resource that is not a reference to another resource.

   Target Resource

      The resource to which requests are forwarded by a reference
      resource. A target resource can be anything that can be identified
      by an absolute URI (see [RFC2396], "absoluteURI").

Internet-Draft    WebDAV Redirect Reference Resources       October 2003


4. Overview of Redirect Reference Resources

   For all operations submitted to a redirect reference resource, the
   default response is a 302 (Found), accompanied by the Redirect-Ref
   header (defined in Section 11.1 below) and the Location header set to
   the URI of the target resource.  With this information, the client
   can resubmit the request to the URI of the target resource.

   A redirect reference resource never automatically forwards requests
   to its target resource. Redirect resources bring the same benefits as
   links in HTML documents. They can be created and maintained without
   the involvement or even knowledge of their target resource. This
   reduces the cost of linking between resources."

   If the client is aware that it is operating on a redirect reference
   resource, it can resolve the reference by retrieving the reference
   resource's DAV:reftarget property (defined in Section 12.1 below),
   whose value contains the URI of the target resource.  It can then
   submit requests to the target resource.

   A redirect reference resource is a new type of resource. To
   distinguish redirect reference resources from non-reference
   resources, a new value of the DAV:resourcetype property (defined in
   [RFC2518]), DAV:redirectref, is defined in Section 13.1 below.

   Since a redirect reference resource is a resource, methods can be
   applied to the reference resource as well as to its target resource.
   The Apply-To-Redirect-Ref request header (defined in Section 11.2
   below) is provided so that referencing-aware clients can control
   whether an operation is applied to the redirect reference resource or
   to its target resource.  The Apply-To-Redirect-Ref header can be used
   with most requests to redirect reference resources.  This header is
   particularly useful with PROPFIND, to retrieve the reference
   resource's own properties.

5. Creating a Redirect Reference Resource

   The new MKRESOURCE method is used to create new redirect reference
   resources.  In order to create a redirect reference resource using
   MKRESOURCE, the values of two properties must be set in the body of
   the MKRESOURCE request.  The value of DAV:resourcetype MUST be set to
   DAV:redirectref, a new value of DAV:resourcetype defined in Section
   13.1. The value of DAV:reftarget MUST be set to the URI of the target
   resource.

   Used in this way, the MKRESOURCE method creates a redirect reference
   resource whose target is identified by the DAV:reftarget property.

5.1 MKRESOURCE

   The MKRESOURCE method requests the creation of a redirect reference
   resource and initialization of its properties in one atomic
   operation.

   Preconditions:

      A resource MUST NOT exist at the Request-URI.

   Request Marshalling:

      The location of the new resource to be created is specified by the
      Request-URI.

      The request body of the MKRESOURCE method MUST consist of the
      DAV:propertyupdate XML element defined in Section 12.13 of
      [RFC2518], specifying a DAV:resourcetype of "DAV:redirectref".

   Postconditions:

      If the response status code is 201, a new resource exists at the
      Request-URI.

      The properties of the new resource are as specified by the
      DAV:propertyupdate request body, using PROPPATCH semantics.

      If the response status code is not 201, then a new resource is not
      created at the Request-URI, and any existing resource at the
      Request-URI is unaffected.

   Response Marshalling:

      Responses from a MKRESOURCE request MUST NOT be cached, as
      MKRESOURCE has non-idempotent semantics.

Internet-Draft    WebDAV Redirect Reference Resources       October 2003


      The following status codes can be expected in responses to
      MKRESOURCE:

      201 (Created): The new resource was successfully created.

      403 (Forbidden): The server does not allow the creation of the
      requested resource type at the requested location, or the parent
      collection of the Request-URI exists but cannot accept members.

      409 (Conflict): A resource cannot be created at the Request-URI
      because the parent collection for the resource does not exist, or
      because there is already a resource at that request-URL.

      423 (Locked): The Request-URI is locked, and the lock token was
      not passed with the request.

      507 (Insufficient Storage): The server does not have sufficient
      space to record the state of the resource.


5.2 Example: Creating a Redirect Reference Resource with MKRESOURCE

   MKRESOURCE /~whitehead/dav/spec08.ref HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.ics.uci.edu
   Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
   Content-Length: xxx

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
   <D:propertyupdate xmlns:D="DAV:">

       <D:prop>
         <D:resourcetype><D:redirectref/></D:resourcetype>
         <D:reftarget>
           <D:href>/i-d/draft-webdav-protocol-08.txt</D:href>
         </D:reftarget>
       </D:prop>
     </D:set>
   </D:propertyupdate>

   >> Response:

   HTTP/1.1 201 Created

   This request resulted in the creation of a new redirect reference

6. Operations on Redirect Reference Resources

   Although non-referencing-aware clients cannot create reference
   resources, they should be able to submit requests through the
   reference resources created by reference-aware WebDAV clients.  They
   should be able to follow any references to their targets.  To make
   this possible, a server that receives any request made via a redirect
   reference resource MUST return a 302 (Found) status code, unless the
   request includes an Apply-To-Redirect-Ref header specifying "T". The
   client and server MUST follow [RFC2616] Section 10.3.3 "302 Found",
   but with these additional rules:

   o  The Location response header MUST contain an absolute URI that
      identifies the target of the reference resource.

   o  The response MUST include the Redirect-Ref header.  This header
      allows reference-aware WebDAV clients to recognize the resource as
      a reference resource and understand the reason for the
      redirection.

   A reference-aware WebDAV client can act on this response in one of
   two ways.  It can, like a non-referencing client, resubmit the
   request to the URI in the Location header in order to operate on the
   target resource.  Alternatively, it can resubmit the request to the
   URI of the redirect reference resource with the
   "Apply-To-Redirect-Ref: T" header in order to operate on the
   reference resource itself. In this case, the request MUST be applied
   to the reference resource itself, and a 302 response MUST NOT be
   returned.

   A reference-aware client may know before submitting its request that
   the Request-URI identifies a redirect reference resource. In this
   case, if the client wants to apply the method to the reference
   resource, it can save the round trip caused by the 302 response by
   using an Apply-To-Redirect-Ref header in its initial request to the
   URI.

   As redirect references do not have bodies, GET and PUT requests with
   "Apply-To-Redirect-Ref: T" MUST fail with status 403 (forbidden).

7. Operations on Collections That Contain Redirect Reference Resources

   Consistent with the rules in Section 6, the response for each
   redirect reference encountered while processing a collection MUST be
   a 302 (Found) unless a "Apply-To-Redirect-Ref: T" header is included
   with the request.  The overall response will therefore be a 207
   (Multi-Status). Since a Location header and Redirect-Ref header
   cannot be returned for each redirect reference encountered, the same
   information is provided using properties in the response elements for
   those resources.  The DAV:location pseudo-property and the
   DAV:resourcetype property MUST be included with the 302 status code.
   This necessitates an extension to the syntax of the DAV:response
   element that was defined in [RFC2518]. The extension is defined in
   Section 14 below.

   It is recommended that future editors of [RFC2518] define the
   DAV:location pseudo-property in [RFC2518], so that non-referencing
   clients will also be able to use the response to operate on the
   target resource.  (This will also enable clients to operate on
   traditional HTTP/1.1 302 responses in Multi-Status responses.) Until
   then, non-referencing clients will not be able to process 302
   responses from redirect reference resources encountered while
   processing a collection.

   The Apply-To-Redirect-Ref header (defined in Section 11.2) MAY be
   used with any request on a collection.  If present, it will be
   applied to all redirect reference resources encountered while
   processing the collection.

7.1 MOVE and DELETE on Collections That Contain Redirect References

   DELETE removes the binding that corresponds to the Request-URI.  MOVE
   removes that binding and creates a new binding to the same resource.
   In cases where DELETE and MOVE are applied to a collection, these
   operations affect all the descendents of the collection, but they do
   so indirectly.  There is no need to visit each descendent in order to
   process the request.  Consequently, even if there are redirect
   reference resources in a tree that is being deleted or moved, there
   will be no 302 responses from the redirect reference resources.

7.2 LOCK on a Collection That Contains Redirect References

   LOCK poses special problems because it is atomic. An attempt to lock
   (with Depth: infinity) a collection that contains redirect references
   will always fail.  The Multi-Status response will contain a 302
   response for each redirect reference.

   Reference-aware clients can lock the collection by using

   Apply-To-Redirect-Ref, and, if desired, lock the targets of the
   redirect references individually.

   Non-referencing clients must resort to locking each resource
   individually.

7.3 Example: PROPFIND on a Collection with Redirect Reference Resources

   Suppose a PROPFIND request with Depth: infinity is submitted to the
   following collection, with the members shown here:

   http://www.svr.com/MyCollection/
        (non-reference resource) diary.html
        (redirect reference resource) nunavut

   >> Request:

   PROPFIND /MyCollection/ HTTP/1.1

         <D:resourcetype><D:redirectref/></D:resourcetype>
       </D:prop>
     </D:response>
   </D:multistatus>

   In this example the Depth header is set to infinity, and the
   Apply-To-Redirect-Ref header is not used.  The collection contains
   one URI that identifies a redirect reference resource.  The response
   element for the redirect reference resource has a status of 302
   (Found), and includes a DAV:prop element with the DAV:location
   pseudo-property and the DAV:resourcetype property to allow clients to
   retrieve the properties of its target resource.  (The response
   element for the redirect reference resource does not include the
   requested properties.  The client can submit another PROPFIND request
   to the URI in the DAV:location pseudo-property to retrieve those
   properties.)

7.4 Example: PROPFIND with Apply-To-Redirect-Ref on a Collection with
    Redirect Reference Resources

   Suppose a PROPFIND request with "Apply-To-Redirect-Ref: T" and Depth:
   infinity is submitted to the following collection, with the members
   shown here:

        (non-reference resource) diary.html

   Since the "Apply-To-Redirect-Ref: T" header is present, the response
   shows the properties of the redirect reference resource in the
   collection rather than reporting a 302 status.

    Resource

   Suppose a COPY request is submitted to the following collection, with

     </D:prop>
     </D:response>
   </D:multistatus>

   In this case, since /MyCollection/nunavut is a redirect reference
   resource, the COPY operation was only a partial success.  The
   redirect reference resource was not copied, but a 302 response was
   returned for it.  So the resulting collection is as follows:

   /OtherCollection/

   The server returns a 302 response code for the redirect reference
   resource in the collection.  Consequently, neither the collection nor
   any of the resources identified by its internal member URIs were
   locked. A referencing-aware client can submit a separate LOCK request
   to the URI in the DAV:location pseudo-property returned for the
   redirect reference resource, and can resubmit the LOCK request with
   the Apply-To-Redirect-Ref header to the collection.  At that point
   both the reference resource and its target resource will be locked
   (as well as the collection and all the resources identified by its
   other members).

9. Relative URIs in DAV:reftarget

   The URI in the href in a DAV:reftarget property MAY be a relative
   URI. In this case, the base URI to be used for resolving the relative
   URI to absolute form is the URI used in the HTTP message to identify
   the redirect reference resource to which the DAV:reftarget property
   belongs.

   When DAV:reftarget appears in the context of a Multi-Status response,
   it is in a DAV:response element that contains a single DAV:href
   element. The value of this DAV:href element serves as the base URI
   for resolving a relative URI in DAV:reftarget.  The value of DAV:href
   may itself be relative, in which case it must be resolved first in
   order to serve as the base URI for the relative URI in DAV:reftarget.
   If the DAV:href element is relative, its base URI is constructed from
   the scheme component "http", the value of the Host header in the
   request, and the request-URI.

10. Redirect References to Collections

   In a Request-URI /segment1/segment2/segment3, any of the three
   segments may identify a redirect reference resource.  (See [RFC2396],
   Section 3.3, for definitions of "path" and "segment".)  If any
   segment in a Request- URI identifies a redirect reference resource,
   the response is a 302. The value of the Location header in the 302
   response is as follows:

   The leftmost path segment of the request-URI that identifies a
   redirect reference resource, together with all path segments and
   separators to the left of it, is replaced by the value of the
   redirect reference resource's DAV:reftarget property (resolved to an
   absolute URI).  The remainder of the request-URI is concatenated to
   this path.

   Note: If the DAV:reftarget property ends with a "/" and the remainder
   of the Request-URI is non-empty (and therefore must begin with a "/
   "), the final "/" in the DAV:reftarget property is dropped before the
   remainder of the Request-URI is appended.

   Consider Request-URI /x/y/z.html.  Suppose that /x/ is a redirect
   reference resource whose target resource is collection /a/, which
   contains redirect reference resource y whose target resource is
   collection /b/, which contains redirect reference resource z.html
   whose target resource is /c/d.html.

   /x/y/z.html
       |
       | /x -> /a
       |
       v
   /a/y/z.html
       |
       | /a/y -> /b
       |
       v
   /b/z.html
       |
       | /b/z.html -> /c/d.html
       |
       v
   /c/d.html

   In this case the client must follow up three separate 302 responses
   before finally reaching the target resource.  The server responds to
   the initial request with a 302 with Location: /a/y/z.html, and the

11. Headers

11.1 Redirect-Ref Response Header

   Redirect-Ref = "Redirect-Ref:" (absoluteURI | relativeURI)
                  ; see sections 3 and 5 of [RFC2396]

   The Redirect-Ref header is used in all 302 responses from redirect
   reference resources. The value is the (possibly relative) URI of the
   link target as specified during redirect reference resource creation.

11.2 Apply-To-Redirect-Ref Request Header

   Apply-To-Redirect-Ref = "Apply-To-Redirect-Ref" ":" ("T" | "F")

   The optional Apply-To-Redirect-Ref header can be used on any request
   to a redirect reference resource.  When it is present and set to "T",
   the request MUST be applied to the reference resource itself, and a
   302 response MUST NOT be returned.

   If the Apply-To-Redirect-Ref header is used on a request to any other
   sort of resource besides a redirect reference resource, the server
   MUST ignore it.

12. Properties

12.1 reftarget Property

   Name: reftarget

   Namespace: DAV:

   Purpose: A property of redirect reference resources that provides an
      efficient way for clients to discover the URI of the target
      resource.  This is a read-only property after its initial
      creation. Its value can only be set in a MKRESOURCE request.

   Value: href containing the URI of the target resource.  This value
      MAY be a relative URI.  The reftarget property can occur in the
      entity bodies of MKRESOURCE requests and of responses to PROPFIND
      requests.


   <!ELEMENT reftarget href >


12.2 location Pseudo-Property

   Name: location

   Namespace: DAV:

   Purpose: For use with 302 (Found) response codes in Multi-Status
      responses.  It contains the absolute URI of the temporary location
      of the resource.  In the context of redirect reference resources,
      this value is the absolute URI of the target resource.  It is
      analogous to the Location header in HTTP 302 responses defined in
      [RFC2616] Section 10.3.3 "302 Found."  Including the location
      pseudo-property in a Multi-Status response requires an extension
      to the syntax of the DAV:response element defined in [RFC2518],
      which is defined in Section 14 below.  This pseudo-property is not
      expected to be stored on the reference resource. It is modeled as
      a property only so that it can be returned inside a DAV:prop
      element in a Multi-Status response.

   Value: href containing the absolute URI of the target resource.


   <!ELEMENT location href >

13. XML Elements

13.1 redirectref XML Element

   Name: redirectref

   Namespace: DAV:

   Purpose: Used as the value of the DAV:resourcetype property to
      specify that the resource type is a redirect reference resource.


   <!ELEMENT redirectref EMPTY >

14. Extensions to the DAV:response XML Element for Multi-Status
    Responses

   As described in Section 7, the DAV:location pseudo-property and the
   DAV:resourcetype property may be returned in the DAV:response element
   of a 207 Multi-Status response, to allow clients to resubmit their
   requests to the target resource of a redirect reference resource.

   Whenever these properties are included in a Multi-Status response,
   they are placed in a DAV:prop element associated with the href to
   which they apply.  This structure provides a framework for future
   extensions by other standards that may need to include additional
   properties in their responses.

   Consequently, the definition of the DAV:response XML element changes
   to the following:

   <!ELEMENT response (href, ((href*, status, prop?) | (propstat+)),
   responsedescription?) >

15. Capability Discovery

   Sections 9.1 and 15 of [RFC2518] describe the use of compliance
   classes with the DAV header in responses to OPTIONS, to indicate
   which parts of the WebDAV Distributed Authoring protocols the
   resource supports. This specification defines an OPTIONAL extension
   to [RFC2518].  It defines a new compliance class, called
   redirectrefs, for use with the DAV header in responses to OPTIONS
   requests.  If a resource does support redirect references, its
   response to an OPTIONS request may indicate that it does, by listing
   the new redirectrefs compliance class in the DAV header and by
   listing the MKRESOURCE method as one it supports.

   When responding to an OPTIONS request, any type of resource can
   include redirectrefs in the value of the DAV header.  Doing so
   indicates that the server permits a redirect reference resource at
   the request URI.

15.1 Example: Discovery of Support for Redirect Reference Resources

   >> Request:

   OPTIONS /somecollection/someresource HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org

   >> Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Allow: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, COPY, MOVE
   Allow: MKCOL, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, LOCK, UNLOCK, MKRESOURCE
   DAV: 1, 2, redirectrefs

   The DAV header in the response indicates that the resource /
   somecollection/someresource is level 1 and level 2 compliant, as
   defined in [RFC2518].  In addition, /somecollection/someresource
   supports redirect reference resources.  The Allow header indicates
   that MKRESOURCE requests can be submitted to /somecollection/
   someresource.

16. Security Considerations

   This section is provided to make applications that implement this
   protocol aware of the security implications of this protocol.

   All of the security considerations of HTTP/1.1 and the WebDAV
   Distributed Authoring Protocol specification also apply to this
   protocol specification.  In addition, redirect reference resources
   introduce several new security concerns and increase the risk of some
   existing threats.  These issues are detailed below.

16.1 Privacy Concerns

   By creating redirect reference resources on a trusted server, it is
   possible for a hostile agent to induce users to send private
   information to a target on a different server.   This risk is
   mitigated somewhat, since clients are required to notify the user of
   the redirection for any request other than GET or HEAD. (See
   [RFC2616], Section 10.3.3 302 Found.)

16.2 Redirect Loops

   Although redirect loops were already possible in HTTP 1.1, the
   introduction of the MKRESOURCE method creates a new avenue for
   clients to create loops accidentally or maliciously.  If the
   reference resource and its target are on the same server, the server
   may be able to detect MKRESOURCE requests that would create loops.
   See also [RFC2616], Section 10.3 "Redirection 3xx."

16.3 Redirect Reference Resources and Denial of Service

   Denial of service attacks were already possible by posting URLs that
   were intended for limited use at heavily used Web sites.  The
   introduction of MKRESOURCE creates a new avenue for similar denial of
   service attacks.  Clients can now create redirect reference resources
   at heavily used sites to target locations that were not designed for
   heavy usage.

16.4 Revealing Private Locations

   There are several ways that redirect reference resources may reveal
   information about collection structures.  First, the DAV:reftarget
   property of every redirect reference resource contains the URI of the
   target resource.  Anyone who has access to the reference resource can
   discover the collection path that leads to the target resource.   The
   owner of the target resource may have wanted to limit knowledge of
   this collection structure.

Internet-Draft    WebDAV Redirect Reference Resources       October 2003


   Sufficiently powerful access control mechanisms can control this risk
   to some extent.  Property-level access control could prevent users
   from examining the DAV:reftarget property.  (The Location header
   returned in responses to requests on redirect reference resources
   reveals the same information, however.)

   This risk is no greater than the similar risk posed by HTML links.

Internet-Draft    WebDAV Redirect Reference Resources       October 2003


17. Internationalization Considerations

   This specification follows the practices of [RFC2518] in encoding all
   human-readable content using XML [XML] and in the treatment of names.
   Consequently, this specification complies with the IETF Character Set
   Policy [RFC2277].

   WebDAV applications MUST support the character set tagging, character
   set encoding, and the language tagging functionality of the XML
   specification.  This constraint ensures that the human-readable
   content of this specification complies with [RFC2277].

   As in [RFC2518], names in this specification fall into three
   categories: names of protocol elements such as methods and headers,
   names of XML elements, and names of properties.  Naming of protocol
   elements follows the precedent of HTTP, using English names encoded
   in USASCII for methods and headers.  The names of XML elements used
   in this specification are English names encoded in UTF-8.

   For error reporting, [RFC2518] follows the convention of HTTP/1.1
   status codes, including with each status code a short, English
   description of the code (e.g., 423 Locked).  Internationalized
   applications will ignore this message, and display an appropriate
   message in the user's language and character set.

   This specification introduces no new strings that are displayed to
   users as part of normal, error-free operation of the protocol.

   For rationales for these decisions and advice for application
   implementors, see [RFC2518].

Appendix C. Resolved issues (to be removed by RFC Editor before
            publication)

   Issues that were either rejected or resolved in this version of this
   document.

C.1 lc-60-ex

   Type: change

   [3]

   reuterj@ira.uka.de (2000-02-14): Section 7, para 3: Make it clear
   that these are just examples of client behavior, and are not meant to
   limit the client's behavior to these options.

   Resolution (2003-10-13): Agreed to delete this paragraph. Continue
   discussion of what information should be returned with 302 in
   multistatus. Just location? Also redirectref? Update: ret gid of
   pseudo-property and special response format, define new response
   element instead. See ossue lc-61-pseudo.

C.2 lc-06-reftarget-relative

   Type: change

   [4]

   joe@orton.demon.co.uk (2000-01-29): Why does the spec talk about
   relative URIs in DAV:reftarget in MKRESOURCE requests? Is the server
   required to resolve the relative URI and store it as absolute? Is the
   server required to keep DAV:reftarget pointing to the target resource
   as the reference / target move, or is DAV:reftarget a dead property?

   Resolution (2003-10-13): DAV:reftarget is readonly and present only
   on redirect references that are also WebDAV resources. Add a method
   for setting the target. Change definition of Redirect-Ref header so
   that it has the target as its value (comes back on all 302
   responses). Server MUST store the target exactly as it is set. It
   MUST NOT resolve relatives to absolutes and MUST NOT update if target
   resource moves. See also issue 17, 43, 50, 57

C.3 lc-71-relative

   Type: change

   reuterj@ira.uka.de (2000-02-14): Section 9: Base URI should be the
   Request-URI or href minus its final segment.

   Resolution (2003-10-08): Original WG comment: Fix this. However, this
   is just a misunderstanding. The process of resolving a relative URI
   against a hierarchical base URI already involves removal of the last
   path segment, so the draft is correct here.

C.4 9-MKRESOURCE-vs-relative-URI

   Type: change

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2003-10-08): Do not say anything about
   MKRESOURCE vs relative URIs. The server is supposed to store the
   relative URI, thus the issue of resolving the URI does only apply
   upon retrieval, not creation.

C.5 lc-72-trailingslash

   Type: change

   [6]

   reuterj@ira.uka.de (2000-02-14): Section 10: Forbid DAV:reftarget
   from ending in "/"

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (): (last call WG response): Make the
   note warn about the possibility of two slashes in a row, recommend
   against ending target with a slash, since that could result in two
   slashes in a row.

   Resolution (2003-10-09): It seems that the rule in the 3rd paragraph
   already explains how to deal with this situation. No change.

C.6 lc-50-blindredirect

   Type: change

   [7]

   yarong@Exchange.Microsoft.com (2000-02-11): Replace current language
   explaining the purpose of the Redirect-Ref header with language that
   simply states that it marks blind 302 responses from redirect
   resources. (Section 6.3, 11.1)

   Resolution (2003-10-02): Section 6.3 was removed in response to issue
   48. In 11.1, change the definition of the Redirect-Ref header to have
   the value of the target (relative URI) as its value. Then we don't

   need a method for retrieving the target's relative URI. Presence of
   the Redirect-Ref header lets the client know that the resource
   accepts Apply-To-RR header and the new method for updating target.
   Reject Yaron's suggested language, but make the above changes.

C.7 lc-74-terminology

   Type: change

   [8]

   reuterj@ira.uka.de (2000-02-14): "plain HTTP/1.1 redirect" - find
   some good name for this an use it consistently

   Resolution (2003-10-02): Remove the whole sentence.

C.8 11.2-apply-to-redirect-ref-syntax

   Type: change

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2003-10-17): Many toolkits have
   problems sending empty HTTP headers (optimizing them away).

   Resolution (2003-10-17): Define values "T" and "F" (similar to WevDAV
   Overwrite header). This will also allow clients to express that they
   are aware of redirect extensions without also having to apply the
   request to the reference resource.

C.9 15.1-options-response

   Type: change

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2003-10-20): Fix OPTIONS response
   ("Public" header mentioned, "Allow" header value line break). Remove
   irrelevant response headers.

   Resolution (2003-10-20): Fix.

C.10 lc-79-accesscontrol

   Type: change

   [9]

   reuterj@ira.uka.de (2000-02-22): Section 16.4: "In some environments,
   the owner of a resource might be able to use access control to
   prevent others from creating references to that resource." That would
   not be consistent with the concept of redirect references as weak

   is already the target of some redirection reference.

Appendix D. Open issues (to be removed by RFC Editor before publication)

D.1 lc-85-301

   Type: change

   ejw@cse.ucsc.edu (2000-01-03): Support creation of other than 302
   redirects, especially 301.

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2003-10-13): HTTP seems to distinguish
   the following use cases: (a) permanent redirect (301), (b) temporary
   redirect (302 or 307), (c) redirect to a GET location after POST
   (303) and (d) agent-driven negotiation (300). Among these, (a) and
   (b) seem to be well understood, so we should support both. (c)
   doesn't seem to be applicable. (d) may become interesting when user
   agents start supporting it, so the spec should be flexible enough to
   support a feature extension for that. For now I propose that the
   client is able to specify the redirection type as a resource type,
   such as "DAV:permanent-redirect-reference" and
   "DAV:temporary-redirect-reference". This spec would only define the
   behaviour for these two resource types and would allow future
   extensions using new resource types and suggested response codes.

D.2 lc-38-not-hierarchical

   Type: change

   [10]

   yarong@Exchange.Microsoft.com (2000-02-11): Not Hierarchical: The
   first sentence of the second paragraph of the introduction of the
   redirect spec asserts that the URIs of WebDAV compliant resources
   match to collections. The WebDAV standard makes no such requirement.
   I therefore move that this sentence be stricken.

   Resolution: State the more general HTTP rationale first (alternative
   names for the same resource), then introduce the collection hierarchy
   rationale, which applies only if you are in a WebDAV-compliant space.

D.3 lc-36-server

   Type: change

   [11]

   yarong@Exchange.Microsoft.com (2000-02-11): Servers: Replace "server"
   with "unrelated system" throughout.

Internet-Draft    WebDAV Redirect Reference Resources       October 2003


   Resolution: Try replacing "server" with "host" in some contexts,
   rephrasing in passive voice in others. See also issue 40.

D.4 lc-33-forwarding

   Type: change

   [12]

   yarong@Exchange.Microsoft.com (2000-02-11): Forwarding: Replace
   "forward" with "redirect" throughout.

   Resolution: Use "redirect" for the behavior redirect resources do
   exhibit. Use "forward" for the contrasting behavior (passing a method
   on to the target with no client action needed). Define these two
   terms. See also issue 40.

D.5 lc-37-integrity

   Type: change

   [13]

   yarong@Exchange.Microsoft.com (2000-02-11): Integrity: Intro, para 7
   "Servers are not required to enforce the integrity of redirect
   references." Integrity is not defined. Replace with something
   clearer.

   Resolution: Rewrite to say that the server MUST NOT update the target
   See also issue 6.

D.6 3-terminology-redirectref

   Type: change

   [14]

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2003-07-27): Consider global rename of
   "redirect reference resource" to "redirect resource".

D.7 lc-19-direct-ref

   Type: change

   [15]

   reuterj@ira.uka.de (2000-02-07): Section 4, para 5 and Section 6,
   para 3 discussions of the Apply-to-Redirect-Ref header make it sound

   as if we are specifying direct reference behavior.

   Resolution: Change these passages so that the contrast is between
   applying the method to the redirect reference and responding with a
   302.

D.8 lc-41-no-webdav

   Type: change

   [16]

   yarong@Exchange.Microsoft.com (2000-02-11): Make redirect references
   independent of the rest of WebDAV. The creation method for redirect
   references shouldn't require an XML request body.

   Resolution: We will make redirect references independent of the rest
   of WebDAV. MKREF will not have an XML request body.

D.9 lc-58-update

   Type: change

   [17]

   yarong@Exchange.Microsoft.com (2000-02-11): There needs to be a way
   to update the target of a redirect reference.

   Resolution: Agreed. See also issues 6, 43.

D.10 lc-24-properties

   Type: change

   [18]

   reuterj@ira.uka.de (2000-02-07): Section 5.1: Replace the sentence
   "The properties of the new resource are as specified by the
   DAV:propertyupdate request body, using PROPPATCH semantics" with the
   following: "The MKRESOURCE request MAY contain a DAV:propertyupdate
   request body to initialize resource properties. Herein, the semantics
   is the same as when sending a MKRESOURCE request without a request
   body, followed by a PROPPATCH with the DAV:propertyupdate request
   body."

   Resolution: No longer relevant once we switch to MKREF with no
   request body.

D.11 rfc2606-compliance

   Type: editor

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2003-10-02): Ensure that examples use
   only sample domains as per RFC2606.

D.12 lc-48-s6

   Type: change

   [19]

   yarong@Exchange.Microsoft.com (2000-02-11): Replace all of section 6
   with just this: A redirect resource, upon receiving a request without
   an Apply-To-Redirect-Ref header, MUST respond with a 302 (Found)
   response. The 302 (Found) response MUST include a location header
   identifying the target and a Redirect-Ref header. If a redirect
   resource receives a request with an Apply-To-Redirect-Ref header then
   the redirect reference resource MUST apply the method to itself
   rather than blindly returning a 302 (Found) response.

   Resolution: Keep a summary along the lines of Yaron's proposal (don't
   use the word "blindly"). Keep the bullets detailing the headers to be
   returned. Delete the rest, including the examples. See also issue 28,
   29, 30, 31, 32.

D.13 lc-28-lang

   Type: edit

   [20]

   reuterj@ira.uka.de (2000-02-07): Section 6: Get rid of the sentence
   "A reference-aware WebDAV client can act on this response in one of
   two ways." A client can act on the response in any way it wants.

   Resolution: Agreed. See also issue 48.

D.14 lc-29-lang

   Type: edit

   [21]

   reuterj@ira.uka.de (2000-02-07): Section 6, para 4: Obvious, doesn't
   need to be stated. Maybe note in an example.

   Resolution: Agreed. See also issue 48.

D.15 lc-44-pseudo

   Type: change

   [22]

   yarong@Exchange.Microsoft.com (2000-02-11): Instead of adding an
   optional prop XML element to the response element in 207 responses,
   define a new location XML element and a new refresource XML element.

   Resolution: Agree to define new XML elements that are not
   pseudo-properties. Disagreement about whether refresource is needed.
   See issue 61.

D.16 lc-61-pseudo

   Type: change

   [23]

   reuterj@ira.uka.de (2000-02-14): Section 7: It doesn't make sense to
   ask future editors of RFC 2518 to define DAV:location with the
   semantics it has here. RFC 2518 should provide the information in the
   Location header somehow in multistatus responses, but not by using
   properties.

   Resolution: Define an XML element for location that is not a
   pseudo-property. We'll keep the recommendation that RFC 2518 add this
   for 302 responses. See also issue 44.

D.17 lc-62-oldclient

   Type: change

   [24]

   reuterj@ira.uka.de (2000-02-14): Section 7: It's too strong to claim
   that non-referencing clients can't process 302 responses occurring in
   Multi-Status responses. They just have an extra round trip for each
   302.

   Resolution: Remove last sentence of the paragraph that recommends
   changes to RFC 2518.

D.18 lc-63-move

   Type: change

   [25]

   reuterj@ira.uka.de (2000-02-14): Section 7.1: Is MOVE atomic from the
   perspective of a client? Agrees that there should be no 302s for
   member redirect references, but finds the rationale dubious.

   Resolution: Remove 7.1. Reword 7.2 to avoid concerns with "poses
   special problems" and "due to atomicity".

D.19 lc-57-noautoupdate

   Type: change

   [26]

   yarong@Exchange.Microsoft.com (2000-02-11): Add language to forbid
   servers from automatically updating redirect resources when their
   targets move.

   Resolution: Agreed. See also issue 6.

D.20 lc-53-s10

   Type: change

   [27]

   yarong@Exchange.Microsoft.com (2000-02-11): The behavior described in
   this section would have a very serious impact on the efficiency of
   mapping Request-URIs to resources in HTTP request processing. Also
   specify another type of redirect resource that does not behave as in
   section 10, but instead would "expose the behavior we see today in
   various HTTP servers that allow their users to create 300 resources."
   Be sure we know what behavior will be if the redirect location is not
   an HTTP URL, but, say ftp.

   Resolution: We won't define 2 sorts of redirect references here.
   Servers SHOULD respond with 302 as described here, but if they can't
   do that, respond with 404 Not Found. (It's hard to modularize the
   behavior specified - it impacts processing Not Found cases of all
   methods, so you can't just add it to an HTTP server in a redirect ref
   module.)
