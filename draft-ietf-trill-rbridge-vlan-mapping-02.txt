                         RBridges: VLAN Mapping

             <draft-ietf-trill-rbridge-vlan-mapping-02.txt>


Abstract

   Some bridge products provide a feature known as "VLAN mapping" or
   "VLAN ID translation", in which a bridge translates a data frame's
   VLAN ID from one VLAN to another when it forwards a frame from one
   port to another. This feature facilitates scenarios such as combining
   two bridged LANs with overlapping VLAN IDs into one bridged LAN
   without merging two communities just because they have been given the
   same VLAN ID in the original two clouds. This document describes how
   RBridges can achieve the same functionality.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                    RBridges: VLAN Mapping


1. Introduction

   Bridges perform a feature known as "VLAN mapping" or "VLAN ID
   translation", in which two or more layer 2 clouds are connected
   together using a set of bridges, but in which the VLAN IDs are not
   consistent in the different clouds.

   The set of bridges interconnecting the clouds are known as the "cut
   set", meaning that if that set of bridges is removed, the clouds are
   separated.

   Bridges in the cut set are configured to translate some set of VLAN
   IDs in one cloud to different VLAN IDs when forwarding from one cloud
   to the other.

   One reason to do this is to intentionally not merge VLAN-A endnodes
   in one layer 2 cloud with the community of VLAN-A endnodes in the
   other cloud.

   Another reason to do this is to intentionally merge two communities,
   marked with different VLAN IDs in the different clouds.

   This feature is accomplished solely by configuring bridges in the cut
   set.

   This document explains how to accomplish the same functionality with
   RBridges.  In this document we will assume there are two clouds
   "East" and "West", and RBridges RB1, RB2, and RB3 that interconnect
   the two clouds.

   "internal RBridges".

   General familiarity with the base TRILL protocol [RFCtrill] is
   assumed in this document.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                    RBridges: VLAN Mapping


2. Internal RBridges and VLAN Mapping

   Internal RBridges will not be aware that VLAN mapping is going on.
   They will behave exactly as they would without VLAN mapping.  The
   only evidence they will have of VLAN mapping is the existence of an
   optional TLV that a cut set RBridge, RB1, MAY include in its LSP
   [layer2], listing the VLAN mappings that RB1 is configured to be
   performing.

   Internal RBridges will ignore this TLV field. It is only there for
   detection of misconfiguration.



3. Configuration of Cut Set VLAN Mapping RBridges

   If VLAN A in cloud "East" is to be translated into VLAN B in cloud
   "West", a cut set RBridge RB1 MUST be configured, for every port, as
   to whether that port is in East or West, and configured with VLAN
   mappings, such as:

      "East/VLAN A <----> West/VLAN B"

   That mapping means that when RB1 forwards a frame on a port
   configured to be in East to a port configured to be in West, with the
   VLAN tag of A, it replaces the VLAN tag "A" with "B" in the inner
   encapsulated frame.

   Note that mappings are always symmetric, meaning that if RB1 is
   translating tag "VLAN A" to tag "VLAN B" when forwarding from East to
   West, it will translate tag "VLAN B" to tag "VLAN A" when forwarding
   from West to East.

   The complete rules for a cut set RBridge forwarding a frame from port
   X in VLAN A to port Y are as follows:

   1. If the ports connect to the same cloud, the frame is forwarded
      without VLAN translation.

   2. If the ports connect to different clouds then

      2.a If there is a translation in effect for VLAN A frames arriving
          from the cloud to which port X connects to the cloud to which
          port Y connects, the VLAN ID is changed according to the
          translation.

      2.b If there is no translation in effect for VLAN A frames
          arriving from the cloud to which port X connects to the cloud
          to which port Y connects, the frame is forwarded without
          translating the VLAN.


R. Perlman, et al.                                              [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                    RBridges: VLAN Mapping


   A cut set RBridge MAY be configured with a translation from a valid
   VLAN A to VLAN ID zero, which means to drop frames in VLAN A at the
   cut set RBridge, but this may result in partitioning VLAN A as
   follows: In the diagram below, if the link between RBwest1 and
   RBwest2 fails, then the shortest path from RBwest1 to RBwest2 may be
   through RBcut1, RBeast1, and RBcut2. RBcut1 and RBcut2 might be
   configured to map VLAN A to zero, dropping VLAN A frames, perhaps in
   an attempt to keep VLAN A frames confined to the West region. If so,
   the failure of the link between RBwest1 and RBwest2 partitions VLAN A
   in the West region since the RBridges will try to forward the frames
   via RBcut1-RBeast1-RBcut2 and they will be dropped at RBcut1 or
   RBcut2.

      +--+------+     +--------+          |
         |
      ---+



4. Advertisement of VLAN Mappings

   To detect misconfiguration, a cut set RBridge RB1 MAY advertise its
   VLAN mappings in its LSP. This is done by assigning 16-bit IDs to
   each of the clouds by manual configuration. All cut set RBridges
   SHOULD be configured with the same IDs for the clouds.  So, in our
   example, if "East" is "1" and "West" is "2", and VLAN A in East is
   mapped to VLAN B in West, the TLV [layer2] would report a set of
   mappings, including:

      {(1:A,2:B)}



5. Translation of VLAN IDs by Cut Set RBridges

   If RB1 is configured to believe port X is in "East" and port Y is in
   "West", and RB1 is configured such that "East/VLAN A <----> West/VLAN
   B", then when RB1 forwards data frames from port X to port Y, if the
   received frame from port X has Inner.VLAN (inner header VLAN ID) VLAN
   A , then RB1 changes the VLAN tag from VLAN A to VLAN B as it


R. Perlman, et al.                                              [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                    RBridges: VLAN Mapping


   forwards onto port Y.

   Note: This is true whether RB1 is the appointed forwarder on port X
   for VLAN A and the frame arrives unencapsulated, or whether the frame
   has arrived already encapsulated as a VLAN A frame.

   Likewise, RB1 performs the same VLAN translation whether the frame is
   known unicast or multi-destination.



6. Reporting Attached VLANs by Cut Set RBridges in LSPs

   If RB1 is configured to translate VLAN A in east to VLAN B in west,
   then RB1 reports, in its LSP, that it is connected to both VLAN A and
   VLAN B, even if RB1 is not appointed forwarder for either or both
   VLAN A or VLAN B.

   The reason RB1 must claim to be attached to VLAN A and VLAN B is so
   that multi-destination data frames for VLAN A originating in West
   will not get filtered before reaching RB1, and multi-destination data
   frames for VLAN B originating in East will also not get prematurely
   filtered.



7. Advertising of Multicast Groups by Cut Set RBridges

   If RB1 is configured to translate VLAN A in East to VLAN B in West,
   then RB1 MUST take steps as described below in order to ensure that a
   multicast packet for group G in VLAN A will not be filtered inside
   the West cloud, if there are receivers for (VLAN A, group G) in East
   and vice versa. If the cut set RBridges do nothing, then a multicast
   for VLAN B, group G would be filtered inside the West cloud, since
   RBridges inside the East cloud will only be requesting receipt of
   VLAN A, group G.

   To solve this problem RB1 MUST report connectivity to an IPv4
   multicast router and an IPv6 multicast router for both VLANs A and B.



8. Endnode Advertisements by cut set RBridges

   TRILL allows RBridges to optionally advertise attached endnodes. This
   endnode advertisement uses the TRILL ESADI (End System Address
   Distribution Information) protocol.

   If cut set RBridge RB1 is translating VLAN A (in East) to VLAN B (in
   West), and RB1 is doing ESADI for its attached endnodes in VLAN A, it


R. Perlman, et al.                                              [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                    RBridges: VLAN Mapping


   should transmit the ESADI advertisement inner tagged with VLAN A when
   forwarding onto ports labeled as "East", and transmit the same ESADI
   advertisement inner tagged with VLAN B when forwarding onto ports
   labeled as "West". An East VLAN-A ESADI generated by any RBridge in
   East will automatically get translated into a VLAN B ESADI when
   forwarding into West, because ESADIs are handled just like ordinary
   encapsulated data frames, the VLAN tag to which the ESADI belongs is
   the VLAN tag on the inner data frame, and that VLAN tag will be
   translated by (properly configured) cut set RBridges when forwarding
   between East and West.

9. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions. This section should be
   deleted by the RFC Editor before publication.



10. Security Considerations

   See [RFCtrill] for general RBridge Security Considerations.

   If cut set RBridges have misconfigured VLAN mappings, VLANs may be
   inadvertently partitioned or inadvertently merged and frames may be
   delivered in the wrong VLAN, which could violate security policies.
   However, misconfiguration of VLAN mapping will not cause loops.

Appendix Z: Change Summary

   RFC Editor: Please delete this section on publication.



Changes from -00 to -01

   1. Because RBridges can not tell what cloud other RBridges are in,
      drop the "optimized" option for advertising multicast listeners
      and require the advertisement of multicast router connectivity.

   2. Specify that the cloud connectivity must be specified for all cut
      set RBridges and that cloud IDs are manually configured and are 16
      bit.

   3. Expand rules for VLAN ID mapping/handling at a cut set RBridge so
      as to drop frames that are for a VLAN ID to which another VLAN ID
      is being mapped. (See Section 3.)

   4. Add mention of "VLAN ID translation", the 802.1 name for VLAN
      mapping.

   5. Minor editing changes.



Changes from -01 to -02

   1. Remove previous confused text about VLAN mapping (point 3 in
      changes from -00 to -01).

   2. Add text allowing mapping to zero to indicate frames should be
      dropped. Add text and diagram explaining that this can lead to
      VLAN partition.

   3. Add normative reference to draft-ietf-isis-layer2.

   4. Minor editing changes.
