Internet-Draft             NETCONF over BEEP                 August 2003


1. Introduction

   The NETCONF protocol [1] defines a simple mechanism through which a
   network device can be managed.  NETCONF is designed to be usable over
   a variety of transport protocols.  This document specifies a
   transport mapping over the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP)
   [2] .

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

2. BEEP Transport Mapping

   All NETCONF over BEEP implementations MUST implement the profile and
   functional mapping between NETCONF and BEEP as described below.

2.1 NETCONF Session Initiation

   Managers may be either BEEP listeners or initiators.  Similarly,
   agents may be either listeners or initiators.  Thus the initial
   exchange takes place without regard to whether a manager or the agent
   is the initiator.  After the transport connection is established, as
   greetings are exchanged, they should each announce their support for
   TLS [5] and optionally SASL [4] (see below), as well as for the
   SYSLOG profile [6].  Once greetings are exchanged, if TLS is to be
   used and available by both parties, the listener STARTs a channel
   with the TLS profile.

   Once TLS has been started, a new greeting is sent by both initiator
   and listener, as required by the BEEP RFC.

   At this point, if SASL is desired, the initiator starts BEEP channel
   1 to perform a SASL exchange to authenticate itself.  When SASL is
   completed, the channel MUST be closed.

   Once authentication has occurred, there is no need to distinguish
   between initiator and listener.  We now distinguish between manager
   and agent.

   The manager now establishes an NETCONF management channel for the
   purpose of exchanging capabilities, monitoring progress, and aborting
   remote procedure calls.  As initiators assign odd channels and
   listeners assign even channels, the management channel is BEEP
   channel 1 or 2, depending on whether the manager is the initiator or
   the listener.

   The manager next establishes the NETCONF operational channel for the
   purpose of issuing RPC requests.  This channel is BEEP channel 3 or
   4.

   Finally, if either manager or agent wishes to send or receive
   notifications, it may issue a start on the next available channel if
   the other side has sent the send or receive NETCONF capability.

   At this point, the NETCONF session is established.

2.2 NETCONF RPC Execution

   To issue an RPC, the manager transmits on the operational channel a

   BEEP MSG containing the RPC and its arguments.  In accordance with
   the BEEP standard, RPC requests may be split across multiple BEEP
   frames.

   Once received and processed, the agent responds with BEEP RPYs on the
   same channel with the response to the RPC.  In accordance with the
   BEEP standard, responses may be split across multiple BEEP frames.

2.3 NETCONF <rpc-abort> and <rpc-progress>

   <rpc-abort> and <rpc-progress> requests are issued by the manager on
   the NETCONF management channel, and the agent responds with BEEP RPYs
   on that same channel.

2.4 NETCONF Session Teardown

   Either side may initiate the termination of an NETCONF session.  In
   This is done by issuing a BEEP close on the operational channel after
   the current RPC has completed.  The same is done with any
   notification channels by the end that transmits notifications.
   Finally, BEEP channel 0 is closed.

2.5 BEEP Profiles for NETCONF Channels

   There are two profiles, the management channel profile and the
   operations channel profile.  These are not to be confused with the
   BEEP control channel.

   The operations channel will have two commands, <rpc> and <rpc-reply>.
   The management channel will have one additional operation with
   <rpc-progress>.

2.5.3 Notification Channel Profile

   The NETCONF notification channel profile is defined in RFC 3195 [6].

3. Security Considerations

   Configuration information is by its very nature sensitive.  Its
   transmission in the clear and without integrity checking leaves
   devices open to classic so-called "person in the middle" attacks.
   Configuration information often times contains passwords, user names,
   service descriptions, and topological information, all of which are
   sensitive.  A NETCONF transport protocol, therefore, must minimally
   support options for both confidentiality and authentication.

   BEEP makes use of both transport layer security and SASL.  We require
   that TLS be used in BEEP as described by the BEEP standard.
   Client-side certificates are strongly desirable, but an SASL
   authentication is the bare minimum.  SASL allows for the use of
   protocols such as RADIUS [9], so that authentication can occur off
   the box.

   SASL authentication will occur on the first channel creation.  No
   further authentication may occur during the same session.  This
   avoids a situation where rights are different between different
   channels.  If an implementation wishes to support multiple accesses
   by different individuals with different rights, then multiple
   sessions are required.

   Different environments may well allow different rights prior to and
   then after authentication.  Thus, an authorization model is not
   specified in this document.  When an operation is not properly
   authorized then a simple "permission denied" is sufficient.  Note
   that authorization information may be exchanged in the form of
   configuration information, which is all the more reason to ensure the
   security of the connection.
