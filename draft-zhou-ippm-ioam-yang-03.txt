1.  Introduction

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] records OAM information within user packets
   while the packets traverse a network.  The data types and data
   formats for IOAM data records have been defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  The IOAM data can be embedded in many
   protocol encapsulations such as Network Services Header, Segment
   Routing, and IPv6 [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-transport].

   This document defines a data model for IOAM capabilities using the
   YANG data modeling language [RFC7950].  This YANG model supports all
   the three categories of IOAM data, which are Tracing Option, Proof of
   Transit Option, and Edge-to-Edge Option.

Internet-Draft             YANG Model for IOAM             December 2018


1.1.  Tree Diagrams

   The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Curly braces "{" and "}" contain names of optional features that
      make the corresponding node conditional.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write), "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!" a
      container with presence, and "*" denotes a "list" or "leaf-list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  Design of the IOAM YANG Data Model

2.1.  Profiles

   The IOAM model is organized as list of profiles as shown in the
   following figure.  Each profile associates with one flow and the
   corresponding IOAM information.

   module: ietf-ioam
      +--rw ioam
         +--rw ioam-profiles
            +--rw admin-config
            |  +--rw enabled?   boolean
            +--rw ioam-profile* [profile-name]
               +--rw profile-name                    string
               +--rw filter
               |  +--rw filter-type?   ioam-filter-type
               |  +--rw acl-name?      -> /acl:acls/acl/name
               +--rw protocol-type?                  ioam-protocol-type
               +--rw incremental-tracing-profile {incremental-trace}?
               |  ...
               +--rw preallocated-tracing-profile {preallocated-trace}?
               |  ...
               +--rw pot-profile {proof-of-transit}?
               |  ...
               +--rw e2e-profile {edge-to-edge}?
                  ...

   The "enabled" is an administrative configuration.  When it is set to
   true, IOAM configuration is enabled for the system.  Meanwhile, the
   IOAM data-plane functionality is enabled.

   The "filter" is used to identify a flow, where the IOAM profile can
   apply.  There may be multiple filter types.  ACL is the default one.

   The IOAM data can be encapsulated into multiple protocols, e.g., IPv6
   [RFC8200], Geneve [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve],VxLAN-GPE
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe].  The "protocol-type" is used to indicate
   where the IOAM is applied.  For example, if the "protocol-type" is
   IPv6, the IOAM ingress node will encapsulate the associated flow with
   the IPv6-IOAM [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-transport] format.

   IOAM data includes three usage options with four encapsulation types,
   i.e., incremental tracing data, preallocated tracing data, prove of
   transit data and end to end data.  In practice, multiple IOAM data
   types can be encapsulated into the same IOAM header.  The "ioam-
   profile" contains a set of sub-profiles, each of which relates to one
   encapsulation type.  The configured object may not support all the
   sub-profiles.  The supported sub-profiles are indicated by 4 defined
   features, i.e., "incremental-trace", "preallocated-trace", "proof-of-
   transit", "edge-to-edge".

2.2.  Preallocated Tracing Profile

   The IOAM tracing data is expected to be collected at every node that
   a packet traverses to ensure visibility into the entire path a packet
   takes within an IOAM domain.  The preallocated tracing option will
   create pre-allocated space for each node to populate its information
   . The "preallocated-tracing-profile" contains the detailed
   information for the preallocated tracing data.  The information
   includes:

   o  enabled: indicates whether the preallocated tracing profile is
      enabled.

   o  node-action: indicates the operation (e.g., encapsulate IOAM
      header, transit the IOAM data, or decapsulate IOAM header) applied
      to the dedicated flow.

   o  trace-type: indicates the per-hop data to be captured by the IOAM
      enabled nodes and included in the node data list.

   o  Loopback mode is used to send a copy of a packet back towards the
      source.

      +--rw trace-type?             ioam-trace-types
      +--rw enable-loopback-mode?   boolean

2.3.  Incremental Tracing Profile

   The incremental tracing option contains a variable node data fields
   where each node allocates and pushes its node data immediately
   following the option header.  The "incremental-tracing-profile"
   contains the detailed information for the incremental tracing data.
   The detailed information is the same as the Preallocated Tracing
   Profile, but with one more variable, "max-length", which restricts
   the length of the IOAM header.

   +--rw incremental-tracing-profile {incremental-trace}?
      +--rw enabled?                boolean
      +--rw node-action?            ioam-node-action

      +--rw enable-loopback-mode?   boolean
      +--rw max-length?             uint32

2.4.  Proof of Transit Profile

   The IOAM Proof of Transit data is to support the path or service
   function chain verification use cases.  The "pot-profile" contains
   the detailed information for the prove of transit data.  The detailed
   information are described in [I-D.brockners-proof-of-transit].

   +--rw pot-profile {proof-of-transit}?
      +--rw enabled?                boolean
      +--rw active-profile-index?   pot:profile-index-range
      +--rw pot-profile-list* [pot-profile-index]
         +--rw pot-profile-index    profile-index-range
         +--rw prime-number         uint64
         +--rw secret-share         uint64
         +--rw public-polynomial    uint64
         +--rw lpc                  uint64
         +--rw validator?           boolean
         +--rw validator-key?       uint64
         +--rw bitmask?             uint64

2.5.  Edge to Edge Profile

   The IOAM edge to edge option is to carry data that is added by the
   IOAM encapsulating node and interpreted by IOAM decapsulating node.

   The "e2e-profile" contains the detailed information for the edge to
   edge data.  The detailed information includes:

   o  enabled: indicates whether the edge to edge profile is enabled.

   o  node-action is the same semantic as in Section 2.2.

   o  e2e-type indicates data to be carried from the ingress IOAM node
      to the egress IOAM node.

   +--rw e2e-profile {edge-to-edge}?
      +--rw enabled?                boolean

4.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /ioam/ioam-profiles/admin-config

   The items in the container above include the top level administrative
   configurations related to the IOAM functionalities and all the IOAM
   profiles.  Unexpected changes to these items could lead to the IOAM
   function disruption and/ or misbehavior of all the IOAM profiles.

   o  /ioam/ioam-profiles/ioam-profile

Internet-Draft             YANG Model for IOAM             December 2018


   The entries in the list above include the whole IOAM profile
   configurations which indirectly create or modify the device
   configurations.  Unexpected changes to these entries could lead to
   the mistake of the IOAM behavior for the corresponding flows.

5.  IANA Considerations

   RFC Ed.: In this section, replace all occurrences of 'XXXX' with the
   actual RFC number (and remove this note).

   IANA is requested to assign a new URI from the IETF XML Registry
   [RFC3688].  The following URI is suggested:

           URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ioam
           Registrant Contact: The IESG.
           XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document also requests a new YANG module name in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC7950] with the following suggestion:

           name: ietf-ioam
           namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ioam
           prefix: ioam
           reference: RFC XXXX
