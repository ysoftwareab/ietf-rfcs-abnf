Abstract

   A set of second level domain names are defined under a new top level
   domain name such that local private DNS zones can be maintained
   similar to the private IP addresses reserved in [RFC 1918].  These
   zone locally appear to be part of the global DNS name tree.
   Additional second level domain names are assigned under this TLD for
   loopback addresses and IPv6 link and site local addresses.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                           Local DNS Names


1. Introduction

   The global Internet Domain Name System (DNS) is documented in [RFC
   1034, 1035, 1591] and numerous additional Requests for Comment. It
   defines a tree of names starting with root, ".", immediately below
   which are top level domain names such as .com and .us.  Below top
   level domain names there are normally additional levels of names.

   Generally the information in the DNS is public and intended to be
   globally accessible.  Certainly, in the past, the model of the
   Internet was one of end-to-end openness [RFC 1958].  However, with
   increasing security threats and concerns, firewalls and enclaves have
   appeared. In many cases, organizations have hosts or resources that
   they specifically want to reference with DNS names but which they
   also want to be walled off from global access and even from global
   knowledge of the DNS name.

   In the realm of IP addresses, this has been accomplished by reserving
   three blocks of addresses as documented in [RFC 1918].  Familiarity
   with the contents of that RFC is assumed.

   In the DNS area, local private names have generally been achieved in
   the past by "splitting" DNS at the enclave boundary, giving different
   answers to resolvers depending or whether they are inside or outside
   of the enclave, using different servers for inside and outside, etc.
   as mentioned in [RFC 1918].  Such relatively complex configuration
   diddling is at variance with the simple global tree structure of the
   initial DNS.

   This document specifies an alternative approach to achieving the
   effect of local names that is more in tune with the concept of a
   single global DNS tree or at least the appearance of a single tree.
   Use of this approach is not required and older techniques will
   continue to work.

   [RFC 1918] requires that private IP addresses not be indirectly
   exposed to the general Internet via DNS records or otherwise.  This
   RFC provides the recommended way to accomplish such private IP
   address hiding and carves out an exception thereto for the addresses
   of the servers for some zones which are children of the .local top
   level domain name.



2. Local Names Via The .local Top Level Domain

   The fundamental idea, as described in more detail below, is to define
   second level domains under .local which are served by DNS name
   servers that have private IP addresses.  These server's addresses
   would only be routed within the domain to which the names are local.

   Thus the servers, and the names and resource records inside them,
   would not be directly accessible outside the enclave, if the
   guidelines in this document are followed.

   The following figure shows a highly simplified overview of an example
   configuration:

   Starting at the bottom, pubhost6 is intended to illustrate an
   ordinary host connected to the Internet with domain name
   pubhost6.example.com. Though not indicated in the above diagram,
   every DNS zone is in fact served by at least two hosts (and some but
   substantially more).  The addresses of the servers for the root (.),
   .com, and example.com zones would all be in the public portion of the


Donald E. Eastlake 3rd                                          [Page 4]


INTERNET-DRAFT                                           Local DNS Names


   IP address space, i.e., in the space of all unicast IP addresses not
   reserved for private use.

   Moving to the top of the figure, enclave A represents some
   organization that wishes to have some hosts with publicly visible
   names and some with hidden names that are visible only locally.
   pubhost3.a.com is an example of a publicly visible host which would
   probably have a public IP address although access to pubhost3 from
   outside the enclave might be filtered or even blocked by a firewall
   or the like.  privhost1 and privhost2 are examples of hidden names.
   If a zone with privhost1 and privhost2 in it is served by DNS servers
   with private IP addresses ("private IP addresses A") such that the
   servers are accessible within enclave A but not from outside enclave
   A, then the information is that zone will only be locally visible.
   As show in the above figure, privhost1 and privhost2 have addresses
   that are also private IP addresses, making those hosts inaccessible
   outside enclave A, but it is the private addresses of the DNS
   servers, not of the hosts pointed to from within the private DNS
   zone, that provides the protection for the DNS names and other
   private DNS information.  (From the above simplified diagram, it
   might appear that fully qualified domain names of these hosts would
   be privhost1.local and privhost2.local but the names are actually
   more complex as explained in Section 2.1.)

   Finally, in the middle, another enclave is shown with two hosts with
   visible names and public IP addresses, pubhost4.b.com and
   pubhost5.b.com.  In addition, there are two private host names
   privhost2 and privhost3.  The duplication of privhost2 between
   enclaves A and B would not be a problem as only DNS resolvers in
   enclave A can access the DNS servers with the zone having the enclave
   A version of privhost2 and only DNS resolvers in enclave B can access
   the DNS servers with the zone having the enclave B version of
   privhost2.

   Publicly visible host names are required by [RFC 1918] to have public
   (i.e., globally unique) IP addresses.  Private DNS names would
   normally have private IP addresses, and all do in the figure above,
   but this is not required.  A public IP address could be stored under
   a private name.  And, of course, it is possible for the same physical
   host to have multiple IP addresses, including a mix of public and
   private.  The dotted line in the figure above is intended to indicate
   that privhost3 and pubhost4 are actually the same physical machine.
   The could be accomplished equally well by storing a single public
   address for that host under both the public and private names or by
   having the host answer to both a public IP address stored under the
   public name and a private IP address stored under the private name.
   In the later case you could even also store the public address along
   with the private address under the private name.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                           Local DNS Names


2.1 Local DNS Server Specifics

   A variety of second level names are provided in the .local zone each
   of which is a delegation point to a zone with some number of name
   servers in one of the private IP address space blocks.  The multiple
   second level names permit choice between the different private IP
   blocks and different numbers of servers.  Thus the actual fully
   qualified name for the private host examples in the figure above
   would be more like privhost1.a2.local, privhost2.a2.local, etc. (but
   see Section 2.3 below).

   Glue records are provided to give private IP addresses for initial
   name servers; however, it should be noted that the NS and A records
   in the local zones will dominate the information stored in the .local
   zone. This means that once a resolver has contacted a local server,
   the list of NS RRs in the local zone on that server will control and
   could contain more or different servers than were given at the chosen
   .local delegation point.  Nevertheless, the glue A records in the
   global .local zone do place some constraints of the private IP
   address of the local DNS servers implementing zones which are
   children of .local.

   It is also possible for an enclave to locally configure its own
   version of the .local zone.  Depending on its enclave boundary
   implementation, it might be able to constrain all of its internal
   references to .local to use its own variant version.  This version
   could have whatever private addresses were desired for the name
   servers involved.  Such a configuration MAY be used, but it is
   recommended that the globally accessible .local specified herein be
   used for uniformity.  That way, even a unconstrained resolver
   starting from the normal root servers (i.e., an "out of the box"
   resolver) will correctly resolve or fail to resolve names under
   .local depending on the resolvers location in the network as
   specified herein.

   It is only necessary for the local DNS servers to have private IP
   addresses to achieve the effect of local names.  However, care MUST
   be taken that none of the local DNS servers or any server that might
   cache their output is accessible by any network interface that has a
   non-private IP address.  Otherwise considerable confusion could
   result if local names are resolved by a resolver outside a local
   enclave to private IP addresses which have a different meaning for
   that resolver.

   The Appendix A to this document gives the recommended initial content
   of the .local zone.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                           Local DNS Names


2.2 Local in-addr.arpa Zones

   Inverse lookup of local names corresponding to private IP addresses
   needs to be provided via the in-addr.arpa zone. Appendix B contains
   recommended additions to the in-addr.arpa zone (or subzones thereof)
   to accomplish this.  Because of the fixed naming within this zone,
   different names with different numbers of servers or different
   addresses can not be provided.  As with the forward .local entries,
   the actual NS RRs in the servers serving the private portions of the
   inverse in-addr.arpa will dominate.  When one of these is queried by
   a resolver, it can provide information on additional servers for that
   particular subzone in the private IP address portion of the in-
   addr.arpa tree.



2.3 Name Conflicts

   The intention is that local names would only be used in the enclave
   where the entities they refer to exist, and these names would not be
   exported.  However, experience indicates that. despite best efforts
   to avoid it, some such names will leak out via email cc's, URL's in
   HTML, etc.  (Such leakage occurs regardless of how the local names
   are formed or whether they are accessible via the default root zone.)
   These leaked private names can cause confusion if they can conflict
   with global names or names local to other enclaves.  Use of the
   .local top level domain assures no conflict with global names.  To
   assure no conflict with different local fully qualified names, the
   domain name of the enclave SHOULD always be prefixed to .local.

   For example, a company might have
        host1.company.co.xy
   as a globally accessible host and
        host2.company.co.xy.b3.local
   as a host for internal use only.  The global name could normally be
   resolvable anywhere on the Internet while the local name could not be
   resolved anywhere except within the company enclave.

   Note that different names were chosen for the initial label in the
   two names above, i.e., host1 and host2. The reason for this is that,
   in some environments, local hosts are referred to by an unqualified
   names, such as host3.  For DNS look up purposes, such a name must be
   expanded into a fully qualified domain name and a "search list" of
   possible suffix qualifications is tried.  If, for example, both
   host4.school.ac.xy and host4.school.ac.xy.b3.local existed, then a
   local reference to "host4" would be ambiguous and could lead to
   either machine depending on the order of qualifications tried.  This
   order could even be different in different pieces of local software
   or on different local hosts, resulting in substantial confusion. For
   this reason, it is strongly recommended that disjoint name sets be

INTERNET-DRAFT                                           Local DNS Names


   used for global and local entity unqualified domain names and that
   fully qualified domain names be used wherever practical.



2.4 Nested Enclaves

   It is possible to have enclaves within enclaves.  In general the best
   way to accomplish this is to use a different portion of the private
   IP address space at each nesting level of enclave.  (Private IP
   address space can be reused in enclaves that are siblings or the
   like.)  Then similar entries to those proposed here for .local can be
   made in the private zone referring to name servers with addresses in
   the nested enclave's private IP address space.



3. Other Names in .local

   Three additional second level domain names are assigned in the .local
   top level domain for other types of local names.

   In particular, link.local and site.local are reserved for use in
   qualifying IPv6 link local names and site local names.

   In addition, loopback.local is assigned and given the loopback
   address.



4. Security Considerations

   This section discusses the strength of the privacy offered by using
   subzones of .local, interactions with DNS security, and possible
   interaction with network abuse.



4.1 Strength of Privacy Offered

   It should be noted that the privacy of the DNS information protected
   by storing it in servers with private IP addresses is not strong.  It
   is completely dependent on the integrity of enclave perimeter routing
   to make these servers inaccessible.  And it may occasionally leak out
   in any case due to inclusion in email address fields, web pages, and
   the like, although such leakage should be no worse than current split
   DNS implementations of DNS data hiding.

   Software should not depend on local names being accessible only
   within a particular enclave as someone could deliberately create the


Donald E. Eastlake 3rd                                          [Page 8]


INTERNET-DRAFT                                           Local DNS Names


   same names within a different enclave even if the names incorporate
   the name of the original enclave in an attempt to avoid such
   conflicts.



4.2 Interaction with DNSSEC

   Although an enclave may derive some amount of security by virtue of
   its isolation, it will normally be desirable to implement DNS
   security [draft-ietf-dnssec-secext2-*.txt] within the enclave.  The
   enclave owner should generate their own keys and sign their subzone
   of .local.  However, a signed copy of their public key can not be
   included in the .local zone as it is different for every enclave.
   Thus, to authenticate the .local subzone contents, it will be
   necessary to sign the KEY RR at the apex of the local subzone of
   .local with the .local zone key or another key that is trusted by
   local resolvers or staticly configure the public key for the .local
   subzone in local resolvers.



4.3 Network Abuse

   Use of the defined private server second level domain names under
   return addresses, or the like, could cause DNS, SMTP, and many other
   types of references to IP addresses in the [RFC 1918] blocks.  This
   can occur from within a firewall due to web browsing or email
   processing of web pages or email from virtually anywhere in the
   Internet.  However, this is not a new situation as anyone who
   controls any zone in the DNS, say zone.foo.example, can, although
   this violates [RFC 1918], create entries therein with arbitrary IP
   addresses (including multicast and undefined formats).  Then, by
   using these name entries in email, web links, etc., attempt to cause
   a variety of spurious protocol connections to those addresses.

   Use of .local at least provides some warning that a name may be not
   be correctly resolvable.
