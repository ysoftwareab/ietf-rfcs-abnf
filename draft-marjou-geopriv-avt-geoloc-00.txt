Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Format for Geoloc            June 2008


1.  Introduction

   Nowadays several applications share geographical location
   information.  For example, in the context of VoIP, location
   information can already be exchanged between different users by the
   means of protocols such as SIP or HTTP.  The location data is
   typically exchanged once, or a few times during a session.

   However some moving users may want to share their geographical
   location for a long duration so that remote users can instantaneously
   watch their current location.  In the same vein, during a car race, a
   live show may want to permanently multicast the geographical location
   in addition to the video filmed from the inside of a vehicle.  In
   this type of use-case the geographical location data needs to be
   transported many times per minute in order to reflect the correct
   location.

   Section 3 details the requirements needed by such use-cases

   Based on these requirements, the conclusion is that the Real-time
   Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] is a natural choice to transport
   geographical location data in case of real-time transmission
   scenarios and that a payload format needs to be specified, which is
   done in the following sections of this document.

   As this stage, it is still too early to dive into the details of a
   solution, which means that Section 5 to Section 9 are only a skeleton
   that gives a view of the topics that may be addressed in future
   versions of the draft

   Section 10 discusses the security issues.


2.  Conventions, Definitions and Acronyms

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   Geographical location object: entity made of different elements like
   longitude, latitude, and altitude, all belonging to the same instance
   of a geographical location.


3.  Requirements

   The solution for transporting real-time geographical location needs

   to fulfill the following requirements:

   REQ-1  The protocol MUST support real-time transport of geographical
          location (i.e. small delays, small overhead ...).

   REQ-2  The protocol MUST allow the synchronization of geographical
          location data with other types of media (e.g. video).

   REQ-3  The protocol MUST allow the streaming of geographical location
          data using multicasting.

   REQ-4  The protocol MUST be able to transport geographical latitude,
          longitude, and altitude.

   REQ-5  The protocol SHOULD be able to transport speed and compass
          direction.

   REQ-6  [[Additional geographical parameters?  E.g. : would anyone
          need civic data?]]

   REQ-7  [[Do we want a mechanism that allows to set the precision of
          the transmitted data?]]


   Based on these requirements, we can say that REQ1, RE2, and REQ3 can
   be fulfilled thanks to the RTP protocol [RFC3550], while the other
   REQs can be achieved with a payload format dedicated to the transport
   of geographical location.


4.  Media Format Background

   A first question about geographical localisation data is whether
   there is an already specified format that could be used in an RTP
   payload.

   Historically, NMEA 0183 [NMEA 0183] has been the most widely used
   standard in order to transport GPS data.  One may think about reusing
   NMEA messages into RTP packets.  However, this approach suffers a
   number of drawbacks: 1 - NMEA standard does not only describe the
   format of geographical data, but is also tied to serial link
   interfaces, which means that additional details would be needed to
   indicate what is kept from NMEA or not when using its messages in an
   RTP payload. 2 - There are many NMEA messages, which would require an
   out-of-band negotiation to select the wanted messages.

   Another widely used format for geographical location is the Keyhole
   Markup Language (KML) [KML] promoted by applications such as Google

   Maps or Google Earth.  One may also think about using this file
   format into RTP packet payloads.  However, this approach also suffers
   some drawbacks: 1 - KML format is targeted to annotation and
   visualization on geographical rendering applications.  Though
   geographical data is definitely present, other types of data related
   to the GUI (e.g. orientation views, scales, ...) are far beyond the
   requirements of this document.

   PIDF-LO [RFC4119] is an IETF standard that describes an object format
   for carrying geographical information on the Internet.  While this
   format transports GPS like information, it has 2 drawbacks: 1 - It
   can contain civic location, which is not needed according to the
   current requirements. 2 - The content is described in XML content,
   which may generate some few additional overhead.

   As there is no suited format for exchanging data, there is some sense
   to define a new format for RTP payload data.


5.  Payload Format

5.1.  RTP Header Usage

   The first part of an RTP packet is made of the fixed RTP header
   fields.  The three fields set by the application in the fixed RTP
   header, timestamp, marker bit and payload type are explained here.
   For this payload format these fields should be interpreted and
   defined as following:

   Timestamp: The timestamp is used for identifying the time when the
   location object was acquired by the sender.  One packet must carry a
   single location object.

   Marker bit (M bit): The marker bit is always set to zero.

   Payload Type (PT): The payload type is set dynamically and out of
   band in accordance with current practice.

5.2.  Payload Data

   This section defines a number of general elements making part of the
   geographical location object.

   In this section, it is important to limit the total length taken by
   the different attributes in order to have an object of small length
   and avoid fragmentation.

   All elements start with an eight-bit identifier.  These identifiers

Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Format for Geoloc            June 2008


   are taken from two different number spaces.  The numbers 0-127 are
   used a common number space, identifying general elements and must be
   registered with IANA.  Numbers 128-255 are left for future
   extensions, if any.

   An object SHALL only be present a single time in each packet.

5.2.1.  Latitude Element

   The latitude element (LAT) is used by applications to send the
   latitude.


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | El.type (1)   | Len           | Latitude                      :
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      :                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Len: Number of bytes that the element consists of.

   Latitude: Value of the element.

   [[TODO: discuss the exact data format in next version.]]

5.2.2.  Longitude Element

   The longitude element (LON) is used by applications to send the
   longitude.


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | El.type (2)   | Len           | Longitude                     :
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      :                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Len: Number of bytes that the element consists of.  Valid lengths are
   0-255, where 0 is allowed but lacks purpose.

   Longitude: Value of the element.

5.2.3.  Altitude Element

   The altitude element (ALT) is used by applications to send the
   altitude.


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | El.type (2)   | Len           | Altitude                      :
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      :                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Len: Number of bytes that the element consists of.

   Altitude: Value of the element.


6.  Examples

6.1.  Payload Example

   [[TODO: Add an example]]

6.2.  SDP Example

   Below is an example of SDP describing RTP geographical location
   packets within the same RTP session from port 40000 and at a maximum
   rate of 1000 geographical location objects per second:


   m=application 40000 RTP/AVP 98
   a=rtpmap:98 geoloc/1000
   a=sendonly


7.  Congestion Control Considerations


8.  Payload Format Parameters

8.1.  Media Type Definition

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: geoloc

Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Format for Geoloc            June 2008


   Required parameters:

   rate.  The typical rate is 1000; other rates may be specified.

   [[TODO: Additional details will be added in a future version of the
   draft, when the overall framework is validated.]]

8.2.  Mapping to SDP

   [[TODO: discuss if parameters can be negotiated.]]


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.


10.  Security Considerations

   In the context of real-time geographical location information sent in
   RTP, geographical location can be considered as a regular media, as
   voice or video.  Thus, when there are some privacy concerns about
   sharing the location, the traditional "phone" establishment session
   can apply: thanks to a session control protocol such as SIP, users
   can authenticate the remote peer and they are free to share or not
   their geographical location information within the multimedia
   session.

   Otherwise, as the geographical location is transported with RTP, all
   of the security considerations from Section 14 of RFC3550 [RFC3550]
   apply.
