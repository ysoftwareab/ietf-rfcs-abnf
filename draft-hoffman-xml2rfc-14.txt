                   The 'XML2RFC' version 3 Vocabulary
                      draft-hoffman-xml2rfc-14

Abstract

   This document defines the "XML2RFC" version 3 vocabulary; an XML-
   based language used for writing RFCs and Internet-Drafts.  It is
   heavily derived from the version 2 vocabulary that is also under
   discussion.  This document obsoletes the v2 grammar described in RFC
   2629 and its expected followup, draft-reschke-xml2rfc.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                  December 2014


1.  Introduction

   This document describes version 3 ("v3") of the "XML2RFC" vocabulary;
   an XML-based language ('Extensible Markup Language', [XML]) used for
   writing RFCs ([RFC7322]) and Internet-Drafts ([IDGUIDE]).

   This document obsoletes the version 2 vocabulary ("v2") [XML2RFCv2],
   which contains the extended language definition.  That document in
   turn obsoletes the original version ("v1") [RFC2629].  This document
   directly copies the material from [XML2RFCv2] where possible; as that
   document makes its way toward RFC publication, this document will
   incorporate as many of the changes as possible.

   The v3 format will be used as part of the new RFC series described in
   [RFC6949].  The new format will be handled by one or more new
   processors for checking the XML and converting it to other
   representations.  Features of the expected processors are described
   in Appendix B.

   Note that the vocabulary contains certain constructs that might not
   be used when generating of the final text; however, they can provide
   useful data for other uses (such as index generation, populating a
   keyword database, or syntax checks).

   In this document, the term "format" is used when describing types of
   documents, primarily XML and HTML.  The term "representation" is used
   when talking about a specific instatiation of a format, such as an
   XML document or an HTML document that was created by an XML document.

   The following two sections are a hopefully-complete list of all the
   technical changes between [XML2RFCv2] and this document, as well as
   the design criteria for those changes.

1.1.  Design Criteria for the Changes in v3

   The design criteria of the changes from v2 to v3 are:

   o  The intention is that starting and editing a v3 document will be
      easier than for a v2 document.

   o  There will be good v2-to-v3 conversion tools for when an author
      wants to change versions.

   o  There are no current plans to make v3 XML the required submission
      representation for drafts or RFCs.  That might happen eventually,
      but it is likely to be years away.

   There is a desire to keep as much of the v2 grammar as makes sense



Hoffman                   Expires June 18, 2015                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                  December 2014


   within the above design criteria and not to make gratuitous changes
   to the v2 grammar.  Another way to say this is "we would rather
   encourage backward compatibility but not be constrained by it".
   Still, the goal of starting and editing a v3 document being easier
   than for a v2 document is more important than backwards compatibility
   with v2, given the latter two design criteria.

   v3 is upwards compatible with v2, meaning that a v2 document is meant
   to be a valid v3 document as well.  However, some features of v2 are
   deprecated in v3 in favor of new elements.  Deprecated features are
   listed in Section 1.2.3, and are described in [XML2RFCv2].

1.2.  Differences from v2 to v3

   The format changes in v3 are listed in the following subsections.

1.2.1.  New Elements in v3

   o  Add <dl>, <ul>, and <ol> as new ways to make lists.  This is a
      significant change from v2 in that the child under these elements
      is <li>, not <t>. <li> has a model of either containing one or
      more <t> elements, or containing the flowing text normally found
      in <t>.  These lists are children of <section>s and other lists
      instead of <t>.

   o  Add <strong>, <b>, <em>, <i>, <tt>, <sub>, and <sup> for character
      formatting.

   o  Add <aside> for incidental text that will be indented when
      displayed.

   o  Add <sourcecode> to differentiate from <artwork>.

   o  Add <table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>, <tr>, <td>, and <th> to
      give table functionality like that in HTML.

   o  Add <boilerplate> to hold the automatically-generated boilerplate
      text.

   o  Add <blockquote> to indicate a quotation as in a paragraph-like
      format.

   o  Add <name> to sections, notes, figures, and texttables to allow
      character formatting (fixed-width font) in their titles, and to
      allow references.

   o  Add <postalLine>, free text that represents one line of the
      address.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                  December 2014


   o  Add <displayreference> to allow display of more mneumonic anchor
      names for automatically-included references.

   o  Add <refcontent> to allow better control of text in a reference.

   o  Add <referencegroup> to allow referemcing multi-RFC documents such
      as STDs and BCPs.

   o  Add <link> to point to a resource related to the RFC.

   o  Add <br> to allow line breaks (but not blank lines) in the
      generated output for table cells.

1.2.2.  New Attributes for Existing Elements

   o  Add "sortRefs", "symRefs", "tocDepth", and "tocInclude" attributes
      to <rfc> to cover processor instructions (PIs) that were in v2
      that are still needed in the grammar.  Also add "finalizedTime" to
      indicate the time that the XML is published.

   o  Add "ascii" attributes to <email>, <organization>, <street>,
      <city>, <region> and <code>.  Also add "asciiFullname",
      "asciiInitials", and "asciiSurname" to <author>.  This allows an
      author to specify their information in their native scripts as the
      primary entry and still allow the ASCII-equivalent values to
      appear in the processed documents.

   o  Add "xml:lang" attribute to <artwork>, <postal>, <author>, and
      <organization>.  This is sometimes useful for renderers which
      display different fonts for ideographic characters used in China
      and Japan.

   o  Add the "section", "relative", and "sectionFormat" attributes to
      <xref>.

   o  Add the "numbered" and "removeInRFC" attributes to <section>.

   o  Add the "removeInRFC" attribute to <note>.

   o  Add "pn" to <artwork>, <aside>, <blockquote>, <dt>, <figure>,
      <li>, <section> <sourcecode>, <t>, and <table> to hold
      automatically generated numbers for items in a section that don't
      have their own numbering (namely figures and tables).

   o  Add "display" to <cref> to indicate to processors whether or not
      to display the comment.

1.2.3.  Elements and Attributes Deprecated from v2

   Deprecated elements and attributes are legacy vocabulary from v2 that
   are supported for input to v3 processors.  They are likely to be
   removed from those processors in the future.  Instead of being listed
   in Section 2, they are listed in in Section 3.  See Appendix B for
   more information on processors and how they will handle deprecated
   features.

   o  Deprecate <list> in favor of <dl>, <ul>, and <ol>.

   o  Deprecate <spanx>; replace it with <strong>, <b>, <em>, <i>, and
      <tt>.

   o  Deprecate <vspace> because the major use for it, creating pseudo-
      paragraph-breaks in lists, is now handled properly.

   o  Deprecate <texttable>, <ttcol>, and <c>; replace them with the new
      table elements (<table> and the elements that can be contained
      within it).

   o  Deprecate <facsimile> because it is rarely used and is not
      actually useful; <email> is a much more useful way to get in touch
      with authors.

   o  Deprecate <format> because it is not useful and has caused
      surprise for authors in the past.  If the goal is to provide a
      single URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) for a reference, use the
      "target" attribute on <reference> instead.

   o  Deprecate <preamble> and <postamble> in favor of simply using <t>
      before or after the figure.  This also deprecates the "align"
      attribute in <figure>.

   o  Deprecate the "title" attribute in <section>, <note>, <figure>,
      and <texttable> in favor of the new <name>.

   o  Deprecate the "alt", and "src" attributes in <figure> because they
      overlap with the attributes in <artwork>.

   o  Deprecate the "xml:space" attribute in <artwork> because there was
      only one useful value.  Deprecate "height" and "width" attribute
      in both <artwork> and <figure> because they are not needed for the
      new output formats.

   o  Deprecate the "pageno" attribute in <xref> because it was unused
      in v2.  Deprecate the "none" and "title" values for the "format"
      attribute in <xref> because the former makes no sense semantically

      and the latter because it has unpredictable output.

1.2.4.  Additional Changes from v2

   o  Allow non-ASCII characters in the format; the characters that are
      actually allowed will be determined by the RFC Editor.

   o  Allow <artwork> and <sourcecode> to be used on their own in
      <section> (no longer confine them to a figure).

   o  Give more specifics of handling the "type" attribute in <artwork>.

   o  Allow <strong>, <b>, <em>, <i>, <tt>, <eref>, and <xref> in
      <cref>.

   o  Allow the sub-elements inside a <reference> to be in any order.

   o  Turned off the auto-generation of anchors in <cref> because there
      is no use case for them that cannot be achieved in other ways.

   o  Allow more than one <artwork>, or more than one <sourcecode>, in
      <figure>.

   o  In <front>, make <date> optional.

   o  In <postal>, allow the sub-elements to be in any order.  Also
      allow the inclusion of the new <postalLine> instead of the older
      elements.

   o  In <references>, now require <name> to give the section name.

   o  In <section>, restricted the names of the anchors that can be used
      on some types of sections.

   o  Made <seriesInfo> a child of <front>, and deprecated it as a child
      of <reference>.

   o  <t> now only contains non-block elements, so it no longer contains
      <figure> elements.

   o  Do not generate the grammar from a DTD, but instead get it
      directly from the Relax Next Generation (RNG) grammar [RNG].

1.3.  Syntax Notation

   The XML vocabulary here is defined in prose, based on the Relax NG
   schema ([RNC]) contained in Appendix C (specified in Relax NG Compact
   Notation, "RNC").

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                  December 2014


   Note that the schema can be used for automated validity checks, but
   certain constraints are only described in prose (example: the
   conditionally required presence of the "abbrev" attribute).

2.  Elements

   The sections below describe all elements and their attributes.

   Note that attributes not labeled "mandatory" are optional.

   Many elements have an optional "anchor" attribute.  In all cases, the
   value of the "anchor" attribute needs to be a valid XML "Name"
   (Section 2.3 of [XML]), additionally constrained to US-ASCII
   characters ([USASCII]).  Thus, the character repertoire consists of
   "A-Z", "a-z", "0-9", "_", "-", ".", and ":", where "0-9", ".", and
   "-" are disallowed as start character.  Anchors are described in more
   detail in Appendix B.2.

   Except inside <artwork> and <sourcecode>, horizontal whitespace and
   linebreaks are collapsed into a single whitespace, and leading and
   trailing whitespace are trimmed off.

2.1.  <abstract>

   Contains the abstract of the document.  See [RFC7322] for more
   information on restrictions for the abstract.

   This element appears as a child element of: <front> (Section 2.27).

   Content model:

   One or more <t> elements (Section 2.54)

2.1.1.  'pn' attribute

   The name for the abstract.  See Appendix B.2.1 for a description of
   this.

2.2.  <address>

   Provides address information for the author.

   This element appears as a child element of: <author> (Section 2.7).

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.67)

2.3.1.  'ascii' attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the annotation.

2.4.  <area>

   Provides information about the IETF area to which this document
   relates (currently not used when generating documents).

   The value ought to be either the full name or the abbreviation of one
   of the IETF areas as listed on <http://www.ietf.org/iesg/area.html>.
   The list at the time that this document is being published is:
   "Applications", "app", "General", "gen", "Internet", "int",
   "Operations and Management", "ops", "Real-time Applications and
   Infrastructure", "rai", "Routing", "rtg", "Security", "sec",
   "Transport", "tsv".

   This element appears as a child element of: <front> (Section 2.27).

   Content model: only text content.

2.5.  <artwork>

   This element allows the inclusion of "artwork" into the document.

   <artwork> provides full control of horizontal whitespace and line
   breaks, and thus is used for a variety of things, such as:

   o  diagrams ("line art"),

   o  complex tables, or

   o  protocol unit diagrams.

   Alternatively, the "src" attribute allows referencing an external
   graphics file, such as a bitmap or a vector drawing in SVN, using a
   URI.  In this case, the textual content acts as fallback for output
   representations that do not support graphics, and thus ought to
   contain either a "line art" variant of the graphics, or otherwise
   prose that describes the included image in sufficient detail.

   If the artwork includes either "&" or "<" characters, or the string
   "]]>" those characters need to be encoded using escaping or CDATA
   block(s); see <sourcecode> for a fuller description of these
   solutions.

   In [XML2RFCv2], the <artwork> element was also used for source code
   and formal languages; in v3, this is now done with <sourcecode>.

   There are at least four ways to include SVG in artwork in Internet
   Drafts:

   o  Inline, by including all of the SVG in the content of the element
      (such as "<artwork type="svg"><svg xmlns...">")

   o  Inline, but using XInclude (see Appendix B.1 (such as "<artwork
      type="svg"><xi:include href=...")

   o  As a data: URI (such as "<artwork type="svg" src="data:image/
      svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3...">")

   o  As a URI to an external entity (such as "<artwork type="svg"
      src="http://www.example.com/...">")

   These four methods can also be used for including text artwork, but
   using a data: URI is probably confusing for text artwork.

   This element appears as a child element of: <aside> (Section 2.6),
   <blockquote> (Section 2.11), <figure> (Section 2.26), <section>
   (Section 2.47), <td> (Section 2.57), and <th> (Section 2.59).

   Content model:

   Text

2.5.1.  'align' attribute

   Controls whether the artwork appears left justified (default),
   centered, or right justified.

   Allowed values:

   o  "left" (default)

   o  "center"

   o  "right"

2.5.2.  'alt' attribute

   Alternative text description of the artwork (which is more than just
   a summary or caption).  This is primarily used with artwork that is
   text-based.  When the art comes from the "src" attribute, and the
   format of that artwork supports alternate text, the alternative text

   comes from the text of the artwork itself.

2.5.3.  'anchor' attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this artwork.

2.5.4.  'height' attribute

   Deprecated.

2.5.5.  'name' attribute

   A filename suitable for the contents (such as for extraction to a
   local file).

   This attribute generally isn't used for document generation, but it
   can be helpful for other kinds of tools (such as automated syntax
   checkers which work by extracting the artwork).

2.5.6.  'pn' attribute

   The number for this artwork within the section.  The numbering is
   shared with other elements of a section.  This is described in more
   detail in Appendix B.2.

2.5.7.  'src' attribute

   The URI reference of a graphics file ([RFC3986]).

   Note that this can be a "data" URI ([RFC2397]).

2.5.8.  'type' attribute

   Specifies the type of the artwork.  The value of this attribute is
   free text with certain values designated as preferred.  A private
   processor (as described in Appendix B) might add type-specific
   formatting to artwork with the preferred values.  If a processor
   encounters a value for "type" that is not one of the preferred
   values, it can issue a warning but should still use the artwork as if
   it had no "type" attribute.

   The preferred values for <artwork> types are:

   o  ascii-art

   o  call-flow

   o  hex-dump

   o  svg

   The RFC Editor will maintain a complete list of the preferred values
   on its web site, and that list is expected to be updated over time.
   Thus, a consumer of v3 XML should not cause a failure when it
   encounters an unexpected type.

2.5.9.  'width' attribute

   Deprecated.

2.5.10.  'xml:lang' attribute

   Allows specification of the language used.  This is sometimes useful
   for renderers which display different fonts for ideographic
   characters used in China and Japan.

2.5.11.  'xml:space' attribute

   Deprecated.

2.6.  <aside>

   This element is a container for content that is semantically less
   important or tangential to the content that surrounds it.

   o  <ul> elements (Section 2.64)

2.6.1.  'anchor' attribute

2.6.2.  'pn' attribute

   The number for this aside within the section.  The numbering is
   shared with other elements of a section.  This is described in more
   detail in Appendix B.2.

2.7.  <author>

   Provides information about a document's author.  This is used both
   for the document itself (at the beginning of the document) and for
   referenced documents.

   The <author> elements contained within the document's <front> element
   are used to fill the boilerplate, and also to generate the "Author's
   Address" section (see [RFC7322]).

   Note that an "author" can also be just an organization (by not
   specifying any of the name attributes, but adding the <organization>
   child element).

   Furthermore, the "role" attribute can be used to mark an author as
   "editor".  This is reflected both on the front page and in
   bibliographical references.  Note that this specification does not
   define a precise meaning for the term "editor".

   See Section "Authors vs. Contributors" of [RFCPOLICY] for more
   information.

   The ASCII equivalent of the author's full name.

2.7.2.  'asciiInitials' attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the author's intials.

2.7.3.  'asciiSurname' attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the author's surname.

2.7.4.  'fullname' attribute

   The full name (used in the automatically generated "Author's Address"
   section).

2.7.5.  'initials' attribute

   Author initials (used on the front page and in references).

   The value contains one or more initials, each followed by a period.
   Initials should be provided as a whitespace separated list of pairs
   of a letter and a dot.

2.7.6.  'role' attribute

   Specifies the role the author had in creating the document.

   Allowed values:

   o  "editor"

2.7.7.  'surname' attribute

   The author's surname (used on the front page and in references).

2.7.8.  'xml:lang' attribute

   Allows specification of the language used.  This is sometimes useful
   for renderers which display different fonts for CJK characters.

2.8.  <b>

   Causes the text to be displayed in bold.  It is almost always a
   better idea to use the <strong> element instead.  This element can be
   combined with other character formatting elements, and the formatting
   will be additive.

   Comments can be used in a document while it is work-in-progress.
   They usually appear either inline and visually highlighted, at the
   end of the document (depending on file representation and settings of
   the processor), or not at all (when generating an RFC).

   This element appears as a child element of: <annotation>
   (Section 2.3), <b> (Section 2.8), <c> (Section 3.1), <dd>
   (Section 2.19), <dt> (Section 2.22), <em> (Section 2.23), <i>
   (Section 2.28), <li> (Section 2.31), <name> (Section 2.34),
   <postamble> (Section 3.5), <preamble> (Section 3.6), <strong>
   (Section 2.51), <sub> (Section 2.52), <sup> (Section 2.53), <t>
   (Section 2.54), <td> (Section 2.57), <th> (Section 2.59), <tt>
   (Section 2.63), and <ttcol> (Section 3.9).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  Text

   o  <b> elements (Section 2.8)

   o  <em> elements (Section 2.23)

   o  <eref> elements (Section 2.25)

   o  <i> elements (Section 2.28)

   o  <strong> elements (Section 2.51)

   o  <sub> elements (Section 2.52)

   o  <sup> elements (Section 2.53)

   o  <tt> elements (Section 2.63)

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.67)

2.17.1.  'anchor' attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this comment.

2.17.2.  'display' attribute

   Says whether or not the the comment should be displayed by
   processors.  This might be set to "false" if you want to keep a
   comment in a document after the contents of the comment have already
   been dealt with.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true" (default)

   o  "false"

2.17.3.  'source' attribute

   Holds the "source" of a comment, such as the name or the initials of
   the person who made the comment.

2.18.  <date>

   Provides information about the publication date.

   Note that this element is used both for the boilerplate of the
   document being produced, and also inside bibliographic references
   that use the <front> element.

   In the boilerplate case, it defines the date of publication for the
   current document (Internet Draft or RFC).  When producing Internet-
   Drafts, the Draft Processor uses this date to compute the expiration
   date (see [IDGUIDE]).  When one or more of "year", "month", or "day"
   are left out, the processor will attempt to use the current system
   date if the attributes that are present are consistent with that
   date.

   Also in the first case, that month names, if given, need to match the
   full English month name: "January", "February", "March", "April",
   "May, "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November",
   or "December".

   In the case of bibliographic references, the date information can
   have prose text for the month or year.  For example, vague dates
   (year="ca. 2000"), date ranges (year="2012-2013"), non-specific
   months (month="Second quarter") and so on, are allowed.

   This element appears as a child element of: <front> (Section 2.27).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.18.1.  'day' attribute

   In the "boilerplate" case: the day of publication; this is a number.
   Otherwise: an indication of the publication day, with the format not
   being restricted.

2.18.2.  'month' attribute

   In the "boilerplate" case: the month of publication; this is the
   English name of the month.  Otherwise: an indication of the
   publication month, with the format not being restricted.

2.18.3.  'year' attribute

   In the "boilerplate" case: the year of publication; this is a number
   (usually four-digit).  Otherwise: an indication of the publication
   year, with the format not being restricted.

2.19.  <dd>

   The definition part of an entry in a definition list.

   This element appears as a child element of: <dl> (Section 2.21).

   Content model:

   Either:

      One or more <t> elements (Section 2.54)

   Or:

      In any order, but at least one of:

      *  Text

      *  <b> elements (Section 2.8)

      *  <sup> elements (Section 2.53)

      *  <tt> elements (Section 2.63)

      *  <xref> elements (Section 2.67)

2.20.  <displayreference>

   This element gives a mapping between the anchor of a reference and a
   name that will be displayed instead.  This allows authors to display
   more mneumonic anchor names for automatically-included references.
   For example, if the reference uses the anchor "RFC6949", the
   following would cause that anchor in the body of displayed documents
   to be "RFC-dev":

   <displayreference from="RFC6449" to="RFC-dev"/>

   If a reference section is sorted, this element changes the sort
   order.

   This element appears as a child element of: <back> (Section 2.9).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.20.1.  'target' attribute (mandatory)

   This attribute must be the name of an anchor in a <reference>
   element.

2.20.2.  'to' attribute (mandatory)

   This attribute is a name that will be displayed as the anchor instead
   of the anchor that is given in the <reference> element.  The string
   given must start with one of the following characters: 0-9, a-z, A-Z.
   The other characters in the string must be 0-9, a-z, A-Z, "-", ".",
   and "_".

2.21.  <dl>

   A definition list.  Each entry has a pair of elements: a term (<dt>)
   and a definition (<dd>).  (This is slightly different than the model
   used in HTML, whicl allows for multiple terms for a single
   definition.)

   This element appears as a child element of: <aside> (Section 2.6),
   <section> (Section 2.47), <td> (Section 2.57), and <th>
   (Section 2.59).

2.21.1.  'hanging' attribute

   The hanging attribute defines whether or not the term appears on the
   same line as the definition. hanging="true" indicates that the term
   is to the left of the definition, while hanging="false" indicates
   that the term will be on a separate line.

   Allowed values:

   o  "false"

   o  "true" (default)

2.21.2.  'spacing' attribute

   Defines whether or not there is a blank line between entries.
   spacing="normal" indicates a single blank line, while
   spacing="compact" indicates no space between.

   Allowed values:

   o  "normal" (default)

   o  "compact"

   well), grouped under a regular entry.

   Index entries generally refer to the exact place where the <iref>
   element occured.  An exception is the occurence as a child element of

2.32.  <link>

   A link to an external document that is related to the RFC.

   The following are the supported types of external documents that can
   be pointed to in a <link> element:

   o  The current ISSN for the RFC Series.  The value for the "rel"
      attribute is "isPartOf".  The link should use the form
      "urn:issn:".

   o  The DOI for this document.  The value for the "rel" attribute is
      "describedBy".  The link should use the form specified in [DOI].

   o  The Internet Draft that was submitted to the RFC Editor to become
      the published RFC.  The value for the "rel" attribute is
      "convertedFrom".  The link should be to an IETF-controlled web
      site that retains copies of Internet Drafts.

   o  A representation of the document offered by the document author.
      The value for the "rel" attribute is "alternate".  The link can be

   One or more <section> elements (Section 2.47)

2.34.  <name>

   The name of the section, note, figure, or texttable.  This name can
   have flow markup such as to make some characters use a fixed-width
   font, or to include references.

   This element appears as a child element of: <figure> (Section 2.26),
   <note> (Section 2.35), <references> (Section 2.44), <section>

2.34.1.  'slugifiedName' attribute

   This attribute is filled in by a processor with a "slugified" version
   of the text in the element.  This attribute can be used in the output
   formats for elements that have both names and numbers.

2.35.  <note>

   Creates an unnumbered section that appears after the abstract.

   It is usually used for additional information to reviewers (working
   group information, mailing list, ...), or for additional publication
   information such as "IESG Notes".

   2.  One or more <t> elements (Section 2.54)

2.35.1.  'pn' attribute

   The name for this note.  See Appendix B.2.1 for a description of
   this.

2.35.2.  'removeInRFC' attribute

   If set to "yes", this note is marked in the processor with text
   indicating that it should be removed before the document is published
   as an RFC.

   Allowed values:

   o  "yes"

   o  "no" (default)

2.35.3.  'title' attribute

   Deprecated.  Use <name> instead.

2.36.  <ol>

   An ordered list.  The labels on the items will be either a number or
   a letter, depending on the value of the style attribute.

   This element appears as a child element of: <aside> (Section 2.6),
   <section> (Section 2.47), <t> (Section 2.54), <td> (Section 2.57),
   and <th> (Section 2.59).

   Content model:

   One or more <li> elements (Section 2.31)

2.36.1.  'group' attribute

   When a processor sees an <ol> element with a "group" attribute that
   has already been seen, the processor continues the numbering of the
   list from where the previous list with the same group name left off.
   If an <ol> element has both a "group" and "start" attribute, the
   group's numbering is reset to the given start value.

2.36.2.  'spacing' attribute

   Defines whether or not there is a blank line between entries.
   spacing="normal" indicates a single blank line, while
   spacing="compact" indicates no space between.

   Allowed values:

   o  "normal" (default)

   o  "compact"

2.36.3.  'start' attribute

   The ordinal value to start the list at.  This defaults to "1", and
   must be an integer of 0 or greater.

2.36.4.  'style' attribute

   The style of the labels on list items.  If the length of the style
   value is 1, the meaning is the same as it is for HTML:

   a  Lowercase letters (a, b, c, ...)

   A  Uppercase letters (A, B, C, ...)

   1  Decimal numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)

   i  Lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, ...)

   I  Uppercase Roman numerals (I, II, III, ...)

   For style "a" and "A", after the 26th entry, the numbering starts at
   "aa"/"AA", then "ab"/"AB", and so on.

   If the length of the style value is greater than 1, the value must
   contain a percent-encoded indicator and other text.  The value is a
   free-form text that allows counter values to be inserted using a
   "percent-letter" format.  For instance, "[REQ%d]" generates labels of
   the form "[REQ1]", where "%d" inserts the item number as decimal
   number.

   The following formats are supported:

   %c Lowercase letters (a, b, c, ...)

   %C Uppercase letters (A, B, C, ...)

   %d Decimal numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)

   %i Lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, ...)

   %I Uppercase Roman numerals (I, II, III, ...)

   %% Represents a percent sign

   Other formats are reserved for future use.

   It is an error for the style string to be empty, and processors will
   reject documents with an element that has such a style.  For bulleted
   lists, you use the <ul> element.  For lists that have neither bullets
   nor numbers, use the <ul> element with the 'empty="true"' attribute.

   If no "style" attribute is given, the default style is the same as
   "style='%d.'".

2.37.  <organization>

   Specifies the affiliation of an author.

   This information appears in both the "Author's Address" section and
   on the front page (see [RFC7322] for more information).  If the value
   is long, an abbreviated variant can be specified in the "abbrev"
   attribute.

   This element appears as a child element of: <author> (Section 2.7).

   Content model: only text content.

2.37.1.  'abbrev' attribute

   Abbreviated variant.

2.37.2.  'ascii' attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the organization's name.

2.37.3.  'xml:lang' attribute

   Allows specification of the language used.  This is sometimes useful
   for renderers which display different fonts for ideographic
   characters used in China and Japan.

2.38.  <phone>

   Represents a phone number.

   The value is expected to be the scheme-specific part of a "tel" URI
   (so does not include the prefix "tel:"), using the "global numbers"
   syntax.  See Section 3 of [RFC3966] for details.

   This element appears as a child element of: <address> (Section 2.2).

   Content model: only text content.

2.39.  <postal>

   Contains optional child elements providing postal information.  These
   elements will be displayed in an order that is processor-specific.  A
   postal address can contain only a set of <street>, <city>, <region>,
   <code>, and <country> elements, or only an ordered set of
   <postalLine> elements, but not both.

   This element appears as a child element of: <address> (Section 2.2).

   Represents one line of a postal address.  When more than one
   <postalLine> is given, the processor emits them in the order given.

   This element appears as a child element of: <postal> (Section 2.39).

   Content model: only text content.

2.40.1.  'ascii' attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the text in the address line.

2.41.  <refcontent>

   Text that should appear between the title and the date of a
   reference.  The purpose of this element is to prevent the need to
   abuse <seriesInfo> to get such text in a reference.

   For example:

   <reference anchor="April1">

       <author initials="K." surname="Phunny" fullname="Knot Phunny"/>
       <date year="2000" month="April"/>
     </front>
     <refcontent>Self-published pamphlet</refcontent>

2.42.2.  'target' attribute

   Holds the URI for the reference.

2.43.  <referencegroup>

   Represents a list of bibliographic references that will be
   represented as a single reference.  This is most often used for
   references in the STD and BCP series, where a single reference (such
   as "BCP 9") encompasses more than one RFC.

   Document-wide unique identifier for this reference group.  Usually,
   this will be used both to "label" the reference group in the
   references section, and as an identifier in links to this reference
   entry.

2.44.  <references>

   Contains a set of bibliographical references.

   In the early days of the RFC series, there was only one "References"
   section per RFC.  This convention was later changed to group
   references into two sets, "Normative" and "Informative" as described
   in [RFC7322]).  This vocabulary supports the split with the <name>
   child element.  In general, the title should be either "Normative
   References" or "Informative References".

   By default, the order of references is significant.  Processors,
   however, can be instructed to sort them based on their anchor names.

   This element appears as a child element of: <back> (Section 2.9).

2.45.1.  'ascii' attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the region name.

2.46.  <rfc>

   This is the root element of the xml2rfc vocabulary.

   Processors distinguish between RFC mode ("number" attribute being
   present) and Internet-Draft mode ("docName" attribute being present):
   it is invalid to specify both.  Setting neither "number" nor
   "docName" can be useful for producing other types of document but is
   out-of-scope for this specification.

2.46.3.  'docName' attribute

   Specifies the name or the Internet Draft or private document.  A
   private document is one whose representation is not meant to be an
   Internet Draft or RFC.  If the value for this attribute starts with
   the string "draft-", a processor treats the input as an Internet
   Draft; if the value starts with any other string, a processor treats
   this as a private document.  The name in the value should be the
   document name without any file extension.  That is, the value for
   this attribute should be "draft-ietf-somewg-someprotocol-07", not
   "draft-ietf-somewg-someprotocol-07.txt".

   have no <name> element as errors because all sections need a name.

2.47.6.  'toc' attribute

   Indicates to a processor whether or not the section is to be included
   in the table of contents.  This only takes effect if the level of the
   section would have appeared in the table of contents based on the
   "tocDepth" attribute of the <rfc> element, and of course only if the
   table of contents is being created based on the "tocInclude"
   attribute of the <rfc> element.  If this is set to "exclude", any
   section below this one will be excluded as well.  The "default" value
   indicates to include the section if it would be included by the
   tocDepth attribute of the <rfc> element.

2.48.  <seriesInfo>

   Specifies the document series in which this document appears, and
   also specifies an identifier within that series.

   This element appears as a child element of: <front> (Section 2.27),
   and <reference> (Section 2.42; deprecated in this context).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.48.1.  'asciiname' attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the name field.

2.48.2.  'asciivalue' attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the value field.

2.48.3.  'category' attribute

   Document category (see Appendix A.1).

2.48.4.  'name' attribute (mandatory)

   The name of the series.

   The following names trigger specific processing (such as for auto-
   generating links, and adding descriptions such as "work in
   progress"): "BCP", "FYI", "Internet-Draft", "RFC", "STD", and "DOI".

2.48.5.  'value' attribute (mandatory)

   The identifier within the series specified by the "name" attribute.

   For BCPs, FYIs, RFCs, and STDs this is the number within the series.
   For Internet-Drafts, it is the full draft name (ending with the two-
   digit version number).  For DOIs, the value is given such as
   "10.123456/rfc1149", (the actual value will be specified later in
   [DOI]).

2.49.  <sourcecode>

   This element allows the inclusion of sourcecode into the document.

   <sourcecode> provides full control of horizontal whitespace and line
   breaks.  It is thus useful for source code and formal languages (such
   as ABNF or the RNC notation used in this document).  When rendered,
   sourcecode is always shown in a monospace font.

   For artwork such as character-based art, diagrams of message layouts,
   and so on, use the <artwork> element instead.

   A common problem authors have with <sourcecode> is that the XML
   processor returns errors if the text in the artwork contains either
   the "&" or "<" character, or the string "]]>".  To avoid these
   problems, the "&" and "<" characters may be escaped using the strings
   "&amp;" and "&lt;", respectively; the "]]>" string can be represented
   as "]]&gt;".  Alternatively, they may be surrounded in a CDATA
   structure: "<![CDATA[]]>".  For example:

   Desired output:
      allowed-chars = "." | "," | "&" | "<" | ">" | "|"

   Using escaping:
   <sourcecode>
      allowed-chars = "." | "," | "&amp;" | "&lt;" | "&gt;" | "|"
   </sourcecode>

   Using CDATA:
   <sourcecode>
   <![CDATA[   allowed-chars = "." | "," | "&" | "<" | ">" | "|"]]>
   </sourcecode>

   Using CDATA is not a panacea, but it does help prevent having to use
   escapes in places where using using escapes can cause other problems,
   such as difficulty of inclusion from other documents.

   This element appears as a child element of: <blockquote>
   (Section 2.11), <figure> (Section 2.26), <section> (Section 2.47),
   <td> (Section 2.57), and <th> (Section 2.59).

   Content model: only text content.

2.49.1.  'anchor' attribute

2.49.2.  'name' attribute

   A filename suitable for the contents (such as for extraction to a
   local file).  This attribute generally isn't used for document
   generation, but it can be helpful for other kinds of tools (such as
   automated syntax checkers which work by extracting the source code).

2.49.3.  'pn' attribute

   The number for this sourceode within the section.  The numbering is
   shared with other elements of a section.  This is described in more
   detail in Appendix B.2.

2.49.4.  'src' attribute

   The URI reference of a source file ([RFC3986]).

2.49.5.  'type' attribute

   Specifies the type of the sourcecode.  The value of this attribute is
   free text with certain values designated as preferred.  A private
   processor (as described in Appendix B) might add type-specific
   formatting to sourcecode with the preferred values.  If a processor
   encounters a value for "type" that is not one of the preferred
   values, it can issue a warning but should still use the artwork as if
   it had no "type" attribute.

   The preferred values for <sourcecode> types are:

   o  abnf

   o  asn.1

   o  bash

   o  c++

   o  c

   o  cbor

   o  dtd

   o  java

   o  javascript

   o  json

   The RFC Editor will maintain a complete list of the preferred values
   on its web site, and that list is expected to be updated over time.
   Thus, a consumer of v3 XML should not cause a failure when it
   encounters an unexpected type.

2.64.2.  'spacing' attribute

   Defines whether or not there is a blank line between entries.
   spacing="normal" indicates a single blank line, while
   spacing="compact" indicates no space between.

   Allowed values:

   o  "normal" (default)

   o  "compact"

2.65.  <uri>

   Contains a web address associated with the author.

   The contents should be a valid URI (see Section 3 of [RFC3986]).

   This element appears as a child element of: <address> (Section 2.2).

   Content model: only text content.

2.66.  <workgroup>

   This element is used to specify the Working Group (IETF) or Research
   Group (IRTF) from which the document originates, if any.  The
   recommended format is the official name of the Working Group (with
   some capitalization).

   In Internet-Drafts, this is used in the upper left corner of the
   boilerplate, replacing the "Network Working Group" string.
   Formatting software can append the words "Working Group" or "Research
   Group", depending on the "submissionType" property on the <rfc>
   element (Section 2.46.11).

   This element appears as a child element of: <front> (Section 2.27).

   Content model: only text content.

2.67.  <xref>

   Inserts a reference to a different part of a document.

   The generated text depends on whether the <xref> is empty (in which
   case the processor will try to generate a meaningful text fragment),
   and the nature of the referenced document part.

   If the element is empty, a converter must invent text to show for the

   reference.  If the element is filled in and the format being
   converted to supports links, the text from the element is surrounded
   by a link to the reference.

   Any element that allows the "anchor" attribute can be referenced;
   however, there are restrictions with respect to the text content
   being generated.  For instance, a <t> can be a reference target,
   however, because paragraphs are not (visibly) numbered, the author
   will have to make sure that the prose is sufficient for a reader to
   understand what is being referred to.

   Content model: only text content.

2.67.1.  'format' attribute

   This attribute is used to control the format of the generated
   reference text.

   "counter"

      Inserts just a counter; this is used for the number of a section,
      figure, or table.  For example:

     <section anchor="overview">Protocol Overview</section>
     . . .
     See Section <xref target="overview" format="counter"/>
     for an overview.

      might generate

     See Section 1.7 for an overview.

   "default"

      Inserts a text fragment that describes the referenced part
      completely, such as "Section 2" or "Table 4" for internal links,
      or "[XML]" for links to references.  For example:

     . . .
     See <xref target="overview"/> for an overview.

      might generate

     See Section 1.7 for an overview.

   "none"

      There will be no auto-generated text.  This is useful for creating
      a link that will appear in the processed text.

   "title"

      Inserts a title for the referenced element (usually obtained from
      the referenced element's <name> child element.  If the target is a
      reference, then the <title> element inside the <front> element is
      used.

   Allowed values:

   o  "counter"

   o  "title"

   o  "none"

   o  "default" (default)

2.67.2.  'pageno' attribute

   Deprecated.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true"

   o  "false" (default)

2.67.3.  'relative' attribute

   Specifies a relative reference from the main target.  Rendering
   relative references is based on the format for the converted
   document.

   acceptable values are:

   o  "of" (default)

   o  "comma"

   o  "parens"

   For example:

     See <xref target="RFC6949" section="2.3" sectionFormat="of"/>
     for more information.

2.67.6.  'target' attribute (mandatory)

   Identifies the document component being referenced.

   The value needs to match the value of the "anchor" attribute of
   another element in the document.

4.  Internationalization Considerations

   This format is based on [XML], thus does not have any issues
   representing arbitrary Unicode [UNICODE] characters in text content.
   The RFC Editor may restrict some of the characters that can be used
   in a particular RFC; the rules for such restrictions are covered in
   [NONASCII].

5.  Security Considerations

   The "name" attribute on the <artwork> element (Section 2.5.5) can be
   used to derive a filename for saving to a local file system.
   Trusting this kind of information without pre-processing is a known
   security risk; see Section 4.3 of [RFC6266] for more information.

   The "type" attribute of the <artwork> and <sourcecode> elements is
   meant to encourage processors to automatically extract known types of
   content from an RFC or Internet Draft.  While extraction is probably
   safe, those processors might also think that they could further
   process the extracted content such as by rendering artwork or
   executing code.  Doing so without first sanity-checking the extracted
   content is clearly a terrible idea from a security perspective.  More
   generally, a processor that is reading RFCs or Internet Drafts needs
   to be suspicious of any content that it intends to post-process.

   All security considerations related to XML processing are relevant as
   well (see Section 7 of [RFC3470]).

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Internet Media Type Registration

   IANA maintains the registry of Internet media types [BCP13] at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types>.

   This document updates the specification for the Internet media type
   "application/rfc+xml" from the one in [XML2RFCv2].  The following is
   to be registered with IANA.

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  rfc+xml

   Required parameters:  There are no required parameters.

   Optional parameters:  "charset": This parameter has identical
      semantics as the charset parameter of the "application/xml" media
      type specified in Section 9.1 of [RFC7303].

   Encoding considerations:  Identical to those of "application/xml" as
      described in Section 9.1 of [RFC7303].

   Security considerations:  As defined in Section 5.  In addition, as
      this media type uses the "+xml" convention, it inherits the
      security considerations described in Section 10 of [RFC7303].

   Interoperability considerations:  N/A

   Published specification:  This specification.

   Applications that use this media type:  Applications that transform
      xml2rfc to output representations such as plain text or HTML, plus
      additional analysis tools.

   Fragment identifier considerations:  The "anchor" attribute is used
      for assigning document-wide unique identifiers that can be used as
      shorthand pointers, as described in Section 2.8 of [XPOINTER].

      Deprecated alias names for this type:  None.

      Magic number(s):  As specified for "application/xml" in Section
         9.1 of [RFC7303].

      File extension(s):  .xml or .rfcxml when disambiguation from other
         XML files is needed

      Macintosh file type code(s):  TEXT

   Person & email address to contact for further information:  See
      Authors Section.

   Intended usage:  COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:  N/A

   Author:  See Authors Section.

   Change controller:  RFC Series Editor (rse@rfc-editor.org)

6.2.  Link Relation Registration

   The following is a proposed addition to [LINKRELATIONS].

   Relation Name: convertedFrom

   Description: The document linked to was later converted to the
   document that contains this link relation.  For example, an RFC can
   have a link to the Internet Draft that became the RFC; in that case,
   the link relation would be "convertedFrom".

   Reference: This document.

   Notes: This relation is different than "predecessor-version" in that
   "predecessor-version" is for items in a version control system.  It
   is also different that "previous" in that this relation is used for
   converted resources, not those that are part of a sequence of
   resources.

   Application Data: none

A.1.  The /seriesInfo/@category Attribute

   For RFCs, the category attribute (Section 2.48.3) determines the
   "maturity level" (see Section 4 of [RFC2026]).  The allowed values
   are "std" for "Standards Track", "bcp" for "BCP", "info" for
   "Informational", "exp" for "Experimental", and "historic" for
   "Historic".

   For Internet-Drafts, the category attribute is not needed, but will
   appear on the front page as "Intended Status".  Supplying this
   information can be useful to reviewers.

A.2.  The /rfc/@ipr Attribute

   This attribute value can take a long list of values, each of which
   describes an IPR policy for the document (Section 2.46.5).  The
   values are not the result of a grand design, but remain simply for
   historic reasons.  Of these values, only a few are currently in use;
   all others are supported by various tools for backwards compatibility
   with old source files.

      *Note:* some variations of the boilerplate are selected based on
      the document's date; therefore it is important to specify the
      "year", "month" and "day" attributes of the <date> element when
      archiving the XML source of an Internet-Draft on the day of
      submission.

   _Disclaimer: THIS ONLY PROVIDES IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION.  IF YOU
   NEED LEGAL ADVICE, PLEASE CONTACT A LAWYER._ For further information,
   refer to <http://trustee.ietf.org/docs/IETF-Copyright-FAQ.pdf>.

   For the current "Status Of This Memo" text, the submissionType
   attribute (Section 2.46.11) determines whether a statement about
   "Code Components" is inserted (which is the case for the value
   "IETF", which is the default).  Other values, such as "independent",
   suppress this part of the text.

A.2.1.  Current Values: '*trust200902'

   The name for these values refers to the "IETF TRUST Legal Provisions
   Relating to IETF Documents", sometimes simply called the "TLP", which
   went into effect on February 15, 2009 ([TLP2.0]).  Updates to this
   document were published on September 12, 2009 ([TLP3.0]) and on
   December 28, 2009 ([TLP4.0]), modifying the license for code
   components (see <http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/> for further
   information).  The actual text is located in Section 6 ("Text To Be
   Included in IETF Documents") of these documents.

A.2.1.1.  trust200902

   This value should be used unless one of the more specific
   '*trust200902' values is a better fit.  It produces the text in
   Sections 6.a and 6.b of the TLP.

A.2.1.2.  noModificationTrust200902

   This produces additional text from Section 6.c.i of the TLP:

      This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may
      not be created, except to format it for publication as an RFC or
      to translate it into languages other than English.

      *Note:* this clause is incompatible with RFCs that are published
      on the Standards Track.

A.2.1.3.  noDerivativesTrust200902

   This produces the additional text from Section 6.c.ii of the TLP:

      This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may
      not be created, and it may not be published except as an Internet-
      Draft.

      *Note:* this clause is incompatible with RFCs.

A.2.1.4.  pre5378Trust200902

   This produces the additional text from Section 6.c.iii of the TLP,
   frequently called the "pre-5378 escape clause":

   See Section 4 of
   <http://trustee.ietf.org/docs/IETF-Copyright-FAQ.pdf> for further
   information about when to use this value.

      *Note:* this text appears under "Copyright Notice", unless the
      document was published before November 2009, in which case it
      appears under "Status Of This Memo".

A.2.2.  Historic Values

A.2.2.1.  Historic Values: '*trust200811'

   The attribute values "trust200811", "noModificationTrust200811" and
   "noDerivativesTrust200811" are similar to their "trust200902"
   counterparts, except that they use text specified in <http://
   trustee.ietf.org/license-info/archive/
   IETF-Trust-License-Policy_11-10-08.pdf>.

A.2.2.2.  Historic Values: '*3978'

   The attribute values "full3978", "noModification3978" and
   "noDerivatives3978" are similar to their counterparts above, except
   that they use text specified in Section 5 of [RFC3978].

A.2.2.3.  Historic Values: '*3667'

   The attribute values "full3667", "noModification3667" and
   "noDerivatives3667" are similar to their counterparts above, except
   that they use text specified in Section 5 of [RFC3667].

A.2.2.4.  Historic Values: '*2026'

   The attribute values "full2026" and "noDerivativeWorks2026" are
   similar to their counterparts above, except that they use text
   specified in Section 10 of [RFC2026].

   The special value "none" was also used back then, and denied the IETF
   any rights beyond publication as Internet-Draft.

A.3.  The /rfc/@submissionType Attribute

   The RFC Editor publishes documents from different "document streams",
   of which the "IETF stream" is the most prominent one.  Other streams
   are the "independent stream" (used for things such as administrative
   information or April 1st RFCs), the "IAB stream" (Internet
   Architecture Board) and the "IRTF stream" (Internet Research Task
   Force).

   The values for the attribute are "IETF" (the default value),
   "independent", "IAB", and "IRTF".

   Historically, this attribute did not affect the final appearance of
   RFCs, except for subtle differences in Copyright notices.  Nowadays
   (as of [RFC5741]), the stream name appears in the first line of the
   front page, and it also affects the text in the "Status Of This Memo"
   section.

   For current documents, setting submissionType attribute will have the
   following effect:

   o  For RFCs, the stream name appears in the upper left corner of the
      first page (in Internet Drafts, this is either "Network Working
      Group", or the value of the <workgroup> element).

   o  For RFCs, if affects the whole "Status Of This Memo" section (see
      Section 3.2.2 of [RFC5741]).

   o  For all RFCs and Internet Drafts, it determines whether the
      "Copyright Notice" mentions the Copyright on Code Components (see
      TLP, Section "Text To Be Included in IETF Documents").

A.4.  The /rfc/@consensus Attribute

   For some of the publication streams (see Appendix A.3), the "Status
   Of This Memo" section depends on whether there was a consensus to
   publish (again, see Section 3.2.2 of [RFC5741]).

   The consensus attribute ("yes"/"no", defaulting to "yes") can be used
   to supply this information.  The effect for the various streams is:

   o  "independent" and "IAB": none.

   o  "IETF": mention that there was an IETF consensus.

   o  "IRTF": mention that there was a research group consensus (where
      the name of the research group is extracted from the <workgroup>
      element).

Appendix B.  The v3 Format and Processors

   This section describes topics that are specific to processors.  Note
   that there is some discussion of processors in the main body of the
   document as well.  For example, some elements have descriptions of
   how a processor might create output from the element.

   A processor has multiple roles.  The processor checks whether or not
   the input is valid XML; it also checks whether or not the input XML
   matches this format.  It may have one or more outputs, depending on
   the way that it is invoked.  It might convert the XML to different
   XML, or to a different representation such as HTML or plain text, or
   do no conversion at all.  It also might give diagnostic warnings
   about how to improve the input.

   In v2, the grammar was specified as a DTD.  In v3, the grammar is
   specified only as Relax Next Generation (RNG).  This means that
   processors need to work from the RNG, not from a DTD.  Some of the
   features of the v3 grammar cannot be specified as a DTD.

   This section differentiates between three types of processors:

   o  RFC Processor -- The processor used by the RFC Editor to process
      the input from one of the RFC streams, and to process XML produced
      during the RFC editing process.

   o  Draft Processor -- The processor used by the Internet Draft
      submission tool.  This processor will be defined in a different
      document.

   o  Private Processors -- There may be processors that are meant to
      run on the computers of authors.  These processors may be used to
      produce interim versions of the non-canonical representations so
      that authors can see how their XML might later be rendered; to
      create documents in representations different than those supported
      by the RFC Editor; to possibly create documents that are not meant
      to be Internet Drafts or RFCs; and to convert XML that has
      external information into XML that has that external information
      included.

   It is expected that a single piece of software will be used for both
   the RFC Processor and the Draft Processor, with different application
   settings to differentiate between them.  It is also expected that the
   same software could be used as a Private Processor; others might
   create Private Processors independently, or using parts of, the
   software used by the RFC Editor.

   The RFC Processor and Draft Processor must have clear error

   reporting, giving more context than just a line number.  For example,
   the error messages will differentiate between errors in XML and those
   from the v3 format.

   It is expected that both the RFC Processor and the Draft Processor
   will have options to produce different types of output.  For example,
   they might have a "convert XML to XML" option that expands the XML
   entities in the output.

   The restrictions on the canonical XML for RFCs, as well as how the
   non-canonical formats will look, are described at <https://
   www.rfc-editor.org/rse/wiki/
   doku.php?id=design:format-and-content-rfcs>.

B.1.  Including External Text

   All XML processors for v3 are expected to support XInclude
   [XInclude].  XInclude specifies a processing model and syntax for
   general purpose inclusion of information that is either on the
   Internet or local to the user's computer.

   In the v3 syntax, XInclude is expressed as the <xi:include> element.
   To use this element, you need to include the "xi" namespace in the
   <rfc> element; that is, you need to specify

   xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"

   as one of the attributes in the <rfc> element.

   The most common way to use <xi:include> is to pull in references that
   are already formed as XML.  Currently, this can be done from
   xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org, but later is expected to be from the RFC
   Editor.  For example, if a document has three normative references,
   all RFCs, the document might contain:

   <references>
       <xi:include href="http://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/
          bibxml/reference.RFC.2119.xml"/>
       <xi:include href="http://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/
          bibxml/reference.RFC.4869.xml"/>
       <xi:include href="http://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/
          bibxml/reference.RFC.7169.xml"/>
   </references>

   <xi:include> can be used anywhere an XML element could be used (but
   not where free text is used).  For example, if three Internet Drafts
   are all including a particular paragraph or section verbatim, that
   text can be kept either in a file or somewhere on the web, and be

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                  December 2014


   included with <xi:include>.  An example of pulling something from the
   local disk would be:

   <x:include href="file://home/chris/ietf/drafts/commontext.xml"/>

   In general, XInclude should be used instead of ENTITY references and
   XML Processor Instructions (PIs) that allow external inclusions.

B.2.  Anchors and IDs

   People writing and reading Internet Drafts and RFCs often want to
   make reference to specific locations in those documents.  In the case
   of RFC authors, it is common to want to reference another part of
   their document, such as "see Section 3.2 of this document".  Readers,
   on the other hand, want to reference part of documents that they
   didn't write, such as "see Section 3.2 of RFC 6949".  The XML
   vocabulary in this document attempts to support both sets of people.

   Authors can leave anchors in a document that can later be used for
   references with the "anchor" attribute.  Anchors can be included in
   the following elements: <artwork>, <aside>, <blockquote>, <cref>,
   <figure>, <li>, <reference>, <referencegroup>, <section>,
   <sourcecode>, <t>, and <table>.  The author can then refer to that
   anchor in the "target" attribute of the <xref> element.

   Readers can refer to any element that has an "anchor" attribute by
   that attribute.  Note, however, that most of the time, elements won't
   have anchors.  In the common case, the reader wants to refer to an
   element that does not have an "anchor" attribute, but that element
   has "pn" attribute.

   Processors add the "pn" attribute to many elements during processing.
   This attribute and its value are automatically generated by the
   processor if the attribute is not there; if the attribute is already
   there, the processor may replace the value.

B.2.1.  Overlapping Values

   In the HTML representation of this XML vocabulary, both anchors and
   "pn" attributes will be used in the "id" attributes of elements.
   Thus, there can be no overlap between the names entered in "anchor"
   attributes, in "slugifiedName" attributes, and those that are
   generated for the "pn" attributes.  Also, there are some values for
   the "anchor" values that are reserved for sections, and those
   sections can only have those anchor values.

   The following rules prevent this overlap:

   o  "pn" for regular sections always has the format "s-nnn", where
      "nnn" is the section or appendix number.  For example, this would
      be "s-2.1.3" for Section 2.1.3 and "s-a" for Appendix A.  For the
      <abstract> element, it is always "s-abstract".  For the <note>
      element, it is always "s-note-nnn", where "nnn" is a sequential
      value.

   o  "pn" for <figure> elements always has the format "f-nnn", where
      "nnn" is the figure number.  For example, this would be "f-5" for
      Figure 5.

   o  "pn" for <table> elements always has the format "t-nnn", where
      "nnn" is the figure number.  For example, this would be "t-5" for
      Table 5.

   o  "pn" for all elements not listed above always has the format
      "p-nnn-mmm", where "nnn" is the section number and "mmm" is the
      relative position in the section.  For example, this would be
      "p-2.1.3-7" for the seventh part number in Section 2.1.3.

   o  "slugifiedName" always has the format "n-ttt", where "ttt" is the
      text of the name after slugification.  For example, this would be
      "n-protocol-overview" for the name "Protocol Overview".  The
      actual conversions done in slugification will be specified at a
      later time.

   o  Anchors must never overlap with any of the above.  The easiest way
      to assure that is to not pick an anchor name that starts with a
      single letter followed by a hyphen.  If an anchor does overlap
      with one of the types of names above, the processor will reject
      the document.
