 Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA): Configuration and Policy
                                Mapping
                   draft-pentikousis-supa-mapping-04

Abstract

   Nowadays, the underlying network infrastructure grows in scale and
   complexity, which make it challenging for network operators to manage
   and configure the network.  Deploying policy or configuration based
   on an abstract view of the underlying network is much better than
   manipulating each individual network element, however, in this case,
   the policy and configuration cannot be recognized by the network
   elements.  This document describes guidelines for mapping said
   abstract configuration and policy into device-level configuration and
   the way in which such models will be processed by software to produce
   configuration details for actual devices.  The Simplified Use of
   Policy Abstractions (SUPA) framework overview and primary procedures
   of mapping are described.  Moreover, an exemplary mapping scenario is
   provided to illustrate the defined mechanism.

1.  Introduction

   As the underlying network infrastructure grows, new services are
   introduced, and traffic volumes increase rapidly, it becomes
   significantly more challenging and complicated to maintain the
   network and deploy new services than in the past.  Configuration
   automation can provide significant benefits in deployment agility.
   Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA)
   [I-D.zhou-supa-framework] aims to improve configuration automation by
   introducing multi-level abstractions.  In SUPA, the definition of a
   standardized model for a network topology graph, which could be used
   to describe topologies at any functional layer, and information
   models of various network services and network service development
   policies allow network operators to manipulate their infrastructure
   as a whole rather than individual devices.  Well-designed
   abstractions are able to provide a wide range of granularity for

   various applications needs, from the lower-level physical network to
   high-level network services.  However, these information models
   cannot be directly utilized by network elements, thus a mapping
   mechanism is necessary to bridge the gap between these information
   models and network element-recognized configuration.

   SUPA employs Network Manager/Controller.  Network Manager/Controllers
   represent one or more entities that are able to control the operation
   and management of a network infrastructure and mediate between the
   Service Management and the network elements to provide, maintain and
   deploy network services and policies.  Each Network Manager/
   Controller supports the SUPA interface/protocol and is a software
   repository, which stores the information associated with each network
   element.  The mapping mechanism could be part of the Network Manager/
   Controller implementation in order to map the SUPA model(s) into
   specified configuration models (or so-called southbound interfaces),
   which can be recognized by the network element(s).

4.  Configuration and Policy Mapping

   This section introduces a framework for mapping configuration and
   policy in the context of a network with several network elements and
   one or more Service Managements.

4.1.  Overview

   The SUPA framework for mapping network-level configuration into
   specific network management and controlling policies is illustrated

         Figure 1: SUPA configuration and policy mapping overview

   Service Management manages and programs the underlying network
   elements indirectly based on the abstract view of the network
   infrastructure.  In practice, this means that Service Management can,
   among others, configure the underlying network as a whole rather than
   as a set of individual network elements.  As a result, the diversity
   of the actual network elements in active operation is abstracted,
   which allows Service Management to manage and program the network in
   a simpler, more maintainable and efficient manner.  On the other end

   of the spectrum, the NEs can continue their regular operation without
   having to become cognizant of the fact that configuration is applied
   at the network level.

   In order to bridge the gap between configuration set by Service
   Management and that required by the NEs, the Network Manager/
   Controller has to provide a mapping mechanism which translates the
   configuration settings from the network level to the device level.
   This document considers three modules in the SUPA framework to
   support such a mapping mechanism, as follows.

   First, a network resource module maintains the resource of the
   infrastracture, such as topology of the network, and provides the
   information of the resouce to Service Management.  It also provides
   the necessary information of each network element when mapping
   configuration from the network-level to device-level.  Second, the
   service management and policy module, which is responsible for
   transmitging (send/receive) and process the network-level
   configuration.  Third, the protocol-specific configuration produces
   the output of the mapping mechanism and is responsible for
   distributing the device- level configuration to the corresponding
   network elements.

   In this framework, one would expect the introduction and use of
   algorithms/strategies for specific network services which can
   automatically generate device-level configuration based on the
   Service Management policies/configurations.  Note, however, that said
   algorithms and strategies are out of the scope of this document.

4.2.  Mapping Procedure

   From the view point of Service Management:

   Firstly, Service Management needs some context of the underlying
   network, especially the infrastructure (physical or logical) of the
   network, before it deploys a policy/service to the network.  For
   example, if Service Management attempts to steer traffic from one
   path to another, it should have the information of the existing paths
   first.  Service Management requests this context information from
   Network Manager/Controller, and the information is provided with the
   topology model.  This procedure does not have to be processed every
   time Service Management deploys a policy/service.

   Secondly, Service Management can obtain the current status of a
   service for reference before it deploys a new policy.  In such cases,
   Service Management sends a "GET" request to the Network Manager/
   Controller, and the Network Manager/Controller encapsulates this

   information with the models specified by SUPA network service models
   models.

   Thirdly, Based on the service and policy configuration, and also
   service/network status if neccessary, Service Management deploys the
   action of the policy by sending a "POST" request to the Network
   Manager/Controller.

   From the view point of Network Manager/Controller:

   Firstly, the Network Manager/Controller is responsible for
   maintaining the infrastructure information, and it provides
   information to Service Managements with the network resource models,
   such as topology information model.

   Secondly, once the Network Manager/Controller receives actions of a
   policy from Service Managements, it maps these actions to protocol-
   specific models.  The intelligence/algorithms of how to do the
   mapping is implementation-specific and out of the scope of this
   specification, as are the protocol-specific models.

   Thirdly, with the protocol-specific models, the device-level
   configurations for heterogeneous devices can be generated and
   conveyed by the Network Manager/Controller using, for example,
   [RFC6020], [I-D.bierman-netconf-restconf],
   [I-D.atlas-i2rs-architecture] and CLI, to the corresponding NEs.

        Figure 2: Bandwidth use optimization for DC Interconnection

   Figure 2 illustrates a simple example in which interoperability
   between Service Management and Network Manager/Controller in an
   inter-data center (inter-DC) environment is considered.

   For the purposes of this example, let us focus on the dynamic
   configuration of the IP path between the seven illustrated DCs,
   labeled A, B, C, D, E, F and G, based on the policies.  First of all,
   we would like the IP path to be created based on certain constraints.
   Secondly, we would like to map it to the device-level connections.
   In this scenario, there are two paths from DC A to DC B.  Typical IP
   shortest-path routing would choose path A(192.0.2.1)-C(192.0.2.3) >

   B(192.0.2.2).  However, under certain conditions, such as, for
   instance, when the bandwidth utiliaztion between A and B is beyond 80
   percents, the Service Management can decide that is better to steer
   traffic from path (A, C, B) to a new path which goes through a
   specific node.

   Figure 2 depicts the layer 3 topology of the underlying network.

   First, Service Management needs some information about A, B, C, D and
   the links between them.  This information can be obtained from
   Network Manager/Controller, and it is listed in the fragment below.
   This information is derived from the Topology YANG model described in
   [I-D.contreras-supa-yang-network-topo].

   Secondly, Service Management defines the policy using policy policy
   models defined in SUPA, and then sends the steering information
   derived from service and policy information to Network Manager/
   Controller using a protocol such as [RFC6020], and
   [I-D.bierman-netconf-restconf].  Figure 4 presents the policy for
   traffic steering: the traffic (supaflow) with destination IP address
   192.0.2.11/24 needs to be steered to DC B, the new path must go
   through DC D.  This configuration is derived from the YANG model

   Based on the steering information, the Network Manager/Controller
   generates a path which meets the requirements: in this example, the
   computed path is (A, D, E, B).  Network Manager/Controller also has
   to configure each device on the new path, not only the devices
   specified by the configuration such as node D, but also the devices
   in the underlying network which must be reconfigured, such as node E.
   The topology information is also necessary when Network Manager/
   Controller decides which device ought to be configured.

   With the assistance of other information in Network Manager/
   Controller, such as topology information, service/policy

   configuration can be translated into protocol-specific yang models
   (or southbound interface) first.  Taking node D as an example, the
   configuration expressed in the YANG model defined in
   [I-D.lhotka-netmod-routing-cfg]could be as follows:

   The configuration of other nodes is similar.  Based on this vendor-
   neutral device-level configuration and the features of each NE, the
   NE-specific configuration can be generated.  Once nodes A, C, D and E
   have received their respective NE-specific configurations, the
   device-level configuration could be deployed and then, the traffic is
   steered as Service Management specified.
