Internet-Draft                 HELD Deref                      June 2007


1.  Introduction

   This memo relates to the IETF requirements document for a location
   configuration protocol (LCP) [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps] and the
   requirements document describing location by reference functionality
   [I-D.marshall-geopriv-lbyr-requirements].  The HELD specification
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] describes the geopriv
   layer-7 LCP, and can provide location by value, in the form of a
   PIDF-LO [RFC4119], and location by reference, in the form of location
   URIs.  This memo shows how HELD can satisfy all of the requirements
   outlined in [I-D.marshall-geopriv-lbyr-requirements] to make it
   suitable for reuse as a dereference protocol for HTTP location URIs.

   This document only addresses HTTP location URIs.  Other URI forms,
   the required permissions, and the need for authentication by any
   specific Recipient is deemed to be in the application domain and
   therefore out of scope for this document.  A location URI is
   dereferenced by a location Recipient to obtain the location of a
   Target.  How the recipient obtains the location URI is not in scope
   for this document.  However, a mechanism such as that described in
   [I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance] may be used to provide this
   functionality.

   In order to use a location URI a dereference protocol is required.
   The entity retrieving location (the Recipient) needs to be able to
   convey basic information to the LCS ensure that information for the
   correct Target, in the correct form, to the best accuracy, is
   provided.  To support this functionality the dereference protocol
   needs to provide a means to:

   1: identify the Target for which location is required.

   2: request location in the form required by the application.

   3: indicate the acceptable trade-off between time and accuracy.

   Using HELD, a requestor is able to request a literal location in the
   form of a PIDF-LO, or indirectly in the form of a location URI.  A
   HELD location URI explicitly satisfies the first criteria described
   above in that it must uniquely identify an End-Point.  The remaining
   two criteria are directly addressed by functionality provided in the
   HELD protocol specification.  The remainder of this memo addresses
   HELD's suitability as a dereference protocol based on the
   requirements described in [I-D.marshall-geopriv-lbyr-requirements],
   and describes how it is to be used when dereferencing an HTTP
   location URI.

2.  Terminology

   The key conventions and terminology used in this document are defined
   as follows:

   This document reuses the term Target, as defined in [RFC3693].

   This document uses the term Location Configuration Server, LCS, as
   the node in the access network providing location information to an
   End-Point, or to the node dereferencing a location URI.  This term is
   also used in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Detailed Description

   The following assumptions are made when HELD is used a HTTP location
   URI dereference protocol:

   1: An End-Device has requested a location URI from the LCS using
      HELD.

   2: The LCS has generated an HTTP location URI that uniquely
      identifies the End-Point to the LCS.

   3: The End-Point has conveyed the location URI to a location
      Recipient in a suitably secure manner.

   Given these assumptions a location Recipient is able to request the
   location of a Target from the LCS using a subset of parameters in a
   HELD <locationRequest> message.  The HELD locationRequest is directed
   to the location URI provided by the Target to the location Recipient.

          Figure 1: HELD Location URI Dereference Context Diagram

   The <locationType> parameter allows location to be requested in a
   specific form.  The a thrid-party location Recipient SHOULD NOT
   request location as a locationURI.  The LCS MUST respond with a 400

   "Request Error" if it receives a request for a locationURI where HELD
   is being used as a dereference protocol.  Location information
   provided by the LCS SHALL be a well-formed PIDF-LO complying to the
   rules and guidelines in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile].

   A semantic of HELD is that the LCS will provide location information
   on request even if the location information does not fit the form
   requested.  This stems from the premise that some location is better
   than no location.  HELD provides a means for the requestor to modify
   this behaviour and instruct the LCS to return an error if location
   information is not available in the form requested.  This is done
   using the "exact" attribute, and can be used by a third-party
   location Recipient when HELD is used as dereference protocol.

   Location systems often have more than one determination mechanism at
   their disposal.  Differing determination techniques provide different
   degrees of accuracy over differing periods of time.  Generally, more
   acurate determination techniques require more time.  HELD addresses
   this trade-off by allowing the requestor to specify how long they are
   prepared to wait for a location result.  This the LCS to select the
   most accurate determination technique at it disposal that return a
   result in the specified time.  The HELD attribute for specifying this
   value is the "responseTime" attribute and can be used by a third-
   party location Recipient to specify their preference for accuracy-
   time trade-off .

   Where the LCS is unable to process the location Recipient's request,
   it SHOULD return the appropriate error from the existing HELD error
   set defined in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery].

4.  Security Considerations

   In the general case, possession of the location URI is a grant of
   permission to access location information for the Target.  It is
   therefore the responsibility of the Target to ensure the conveyance
   of a location URI is secure from interception.  One proposed set of
   conveyance measures is addressed in
   [I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance].  The TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL
   cipher suite MUST NOT be used.

4.1.  LCS Identity

   In the normal case connection establishment from the recipient to the
   LCS will be made on HTTP over TLS, and the location URI being
   dereferenced by the Recipient will contain the hostname of the LCS.
   Where the hostname is known to the Recipient, the Recipient MUST
   check it against the LCS identity presented in the server's
   certificate message.  A discrepency MAY indicate a possible man-in-
   the-middle-attack, the the Recpient should take appropriate action
   based on application dependent semantics.  Actions MAY include but ar
   not limited to; proceeding anyway, flagging the result as suspect,
   dropping to HTTP over TCP, or giving up.

   In some applications the Recipient has prior knowledge of the
   expected identity of the LCS, in such cases hostname checking is not
   required.

5.  Recipient Identity

   Typically the Recipient will not be required to authenticate with the
   LCS as possession of the location URI is suffcient is a reasonable
   access token.  Where Recipient authentication is required HTTP basic
   and digest authentication MAY be used; in this situation TLS MUST BE
   used.

Appendix A.  HELD Compliance to IETF Location Reference Requirements

   This appendix describes how HELD complies to the location reference
   requirements stipulated in [I-D.marshall-geopriv-lbyr-requirements].

A.1.  Rq1

   "Location Reference Identifier as a URI: The dereferencing protocol
   MUST support an LRI in URI form, and may support other non-URI
   forms."

   COMPLY.  HELD only provide location references in URI form.

A.2.  Rq2

   "Dereference Protocol Confidentiality: The dereferencing protocol
   MUST support mechanisms for encrypting messages sent between client
   (Location recipient) and server (Location server)."

   COMPLY.  HELD supports the use of HTTP over TLS.

A.3.  Rq3

   "Dereference Protocol Transparancy: The dereferencing protocol MUST
   support the exchange of messages without encryption (i.e., in
   plaintext)."

   COMPLY.  HELD can, if required, be used over straight HTTP.  The
   recommended usage however is over TLS.

A.4.  Rq4

   "Location Reference Expiry: The dereference protocol MUST support
   specification of a finite period of validity for the LRI."

   COMPLY.  HELD location URIs are provided to the End-Point with an
   explicit expiry time.  How and if the End-Point chooses to provide
   this expiry time to a location Recipient is a matter of conveyance
   and is out of scope for HELD.

A.5.  Rq5

   "Dereference Protocol Transport: The de-reference protocol MUST
   support TCP/IP and MAY support UDP/IP."

   COMPLY.  HELD uses HTTP as a transport which runs on top of TCP.

Internet-Draft                 HELD Deref                      June 2007


A.6.  Rq6

   "Dereference Protocol Authentication: The dereferencing protocol MUST
   support both client-side and server-side authentication."

   COMPLY.  The client may authenticate itself to the server using
   HTTP's digest authentication mechanism as described in [RFC2617] and
   updated errata.  The server authenticates itself using the methods
   described in HTTP on TLS [RFC2818].

A.7.  Rq7

   "Location Privacy: The dereference protocol MUST support the
   application of privacy rules to the dissemination of a requested
   location object."

   COMPLY.  When used as a dereference protocol HELD provides location
   in PIDF-LO, including default, or Target assigned usage-rule values.

A.8.  Rq8

   "Dereferenced PIDF-LO Result: The dereferencing of an LRI MUST result
   in a well-formed PIDF-LO."

   COMPLY.  HELD when used as a dereference protocol MUST provide
   location information as a PIDF-LO that complies with
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile] as described in Section 3.
