Internet-Draft    Survey of Middlebox Control Protocols        July 2007


1.  Introduction

   Network address translators (NATs) and firewalls - frequently
   referred to as "middleboxes" - are a subject of active discussion in
   the IETF and related development and standardization communities.
   These devices are not part of the traditional end-to-end Internet
   architecture, because they usually operate on transport- and higher-
   layer information inside the network, which is a layering violation
   in the original architecture, because operating on that information
   was the exclusive providence of the end-hosts.

   However, in practice, NATs have turned out to be necessary to be able
   to mitigate the IPv4 address space limitations of many network
   domains.  Similarly, because the networking software in many systems
   has turned out to contain security defects of different kinds, use of
   firewalls is common to protect the systems from attacks coming from
   the network.  Another motivation for firewalls is to protect against
   the abuse of possibly scarce of expensive bandwidth, for example,
   unwanted traffic on wireless links.

   A shared disadvantage of NATs and firewalls is that they often encode
   knowledge about a particular set of higher-layer protocols and
   applications in order to operate.  This practice prevents new types
   of network protocols or applications from being deployed end-to-end,
   unless the middleboxes are upgraded or reconfigured as well.  For
   example, a firewall is usually configured with a list of ports for a
   set of common network applications, preventing introduction of new
   applications.  Furthermore, they commonly only support traditional
   transport protocols, such as TCP and UDP, preventing the use of other
   protocols, such as IPsec, IP tunneling, or other transport protocols.
   In addition, many NATs and firewalls maintain some state for each
   active transport-layer session that typically needs to be refreshed
   in constant intervals, and can be initiated only by certain hosts.

   The IETF is currently developing recommendations for the operation of
   NATs in the BEHAVE working group.  These recommendations provide
   guidelines for how NATs should translate a number of common
   protocols, including TCP [I-D.ietf-behave-tcp], UDP [RFC4787], ICMP
   [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-icmp] and IP multicast
   [I-D.ietf-behave-multicast].  Other organizations are developing
   similar guidelines.  One example are Microsoft's requirements for the
   "Works with Windows Vista" and "Certified for Windows Vista" logo
   program [VISTALOGO] (see page 121 to page 132).

   Even if these efforts result in more unified behavior of middleboxes,
   they will not necessarily overcome the above-mentioned limitations:
   different protocols and applications will still need to adapt to the
   behavior of NATs and firewalls.  Commonly, new protocols must be

   encapsulated into UDP packets in order to pass through these devices.
   Although the UDP header and protocol logic are minimal and do not
   consume much network capacity, the use of UDP causes other problems,
   because it is not connection-oriented.  Because there are no messages
   for connection establishment or connection tear-down in UDP, a
   stateful NAT or firewall needs to monitor ongoing UDP traffic between
   a source and destination, and in the absence of such traffic assumes
   that the session has ended, removing the related session state.  In
   practice, the timers for state clean-up have turned out to be short
   (on the order of seconds), requiring the end hosts to transmit
   frequent and resource-consuming keep-alive messages to refresh the
   session state maintained at middleboxes.

   A more advanced method to overcome the limitations caused by NATs or
   firewalls would be to allow end-hosts to signal their communication
   characteristics and profiles explicitly to the NATs and firewalls, or
   alternatively to allow these devices to signal their configuration
   information to the end-hosts.  With such schemes, the number of
   state-refreshing keep-alives could be significantly reduced, and NATs
   and firewalls could be made directly aware of the communication
   characteristics of the end-hosts.

   A number of existing protocols have been proposed for this purpose,
   and new proposals are being prepared.  This document aims to support
   such efforts by surveying existing proposals and by discussing the
   the benefits and shortcomings of these schemes.

3.  SOCKS

3.1.  Protocol Overview

   The SOCKS Protocol Version 5 [RFC1928] defines a method for nodes
   located on an IP network (such as an Intranet with no routing to the
   Internet) to establish TCP sessions and exchange UDP datagrams with
   another IP network (usually the global Internet).  To that end, a
   SOCKS server must be located on the boundary of both networks, and
   SOCKS clients must explicitly request the server to relay their
   communication sessions.

   When a SOCKS client establishes a TCP session to the remote network,
   it first connects to the SOCKS server on a well-known TCP port,
   sending a connection request with optional authentication
   credentials.  The request specifies in which direction the TCP
   session is to be established, i.e., whether the SOCKS server will act
   as the active or passive endpoint.  The SOCKS server, if it accepts
   the request, informs the client of the external IP address and TCP
   port number that it will use.  If the SOCKS server acts as the
   passive endpoint, it sends an additional response once the TCP three-
   way handshake is completed.  The SOCKS server then forwards traffic
   between the internal and external TCP sessions, until either of them
   is terminated.

   UDP sessions are also initially negotiated via a TCP session to the
   SOCKS server, in a similar manner.  If successful, the client obtains
   the IP address and UDP port number of a UDP relay server.  The relay
   forwards UDP datagrams between the local and remote networks.  When
   sending a datagram, the client adds an additional, SOCKS-specific
   header, which carries the IP address or DNS name of the remote peer
   and the intended destination UDP port number of the datagram.  The
   relay adds the same header when forwarding datagrams from the remote
   network back to the client.

3.2.  Protocol Analysis

   The SOCKS protocol makes few assumptions about the network
   environment it operates in.  In particular, there can be any number
   NAT/firewall devices between the client and the SOCKS server, and
   there need not be a router between the local and remote networks.  It
   is assumed that the SOCKS server itself can freely exchange TCP and
   UDP packets with the remote network.

   SOCKS supports both IPv4 and IPv6 as well as translation from one to
   the other.  SOCKS only supports UDP and TCP as transport protocols.
   Conveyance of IP header parameters other than the IP addresses (such
   as IP options, hop limit, TOS field, etc.) are not defined.  SOCKS

Internet-Draft    Survey of Middlebox Control Protocols        July 2007


   cannot be used for generic server applications: only one passive TCP
   session per request is allowed.

   The protocol is mature and implementations for clients and servers
   are widely available.  SOCKS is supported in many FTP and HTTP
   clients.  Applications must usually be modified to support SOCKS, but
   it is also possible to implement SOCKS transparently as a shim layer
   above the BSD socket API.

   SOCKS requires manual configuration on the client.  SOCKS server
   address and optional credentials must be explicitly provisioned.


4.  NSIS - NAT/Firewall Signaling Layer Protocol

4.1.  Protocol Overview

   NSIS uses a two-layer architecture with one lower-layer transport
   (NTLP) and multiple upper-layer application signaling protocols
   (NSLPs).  This section first discusses the generic properties of the
   NTLP transport and then the specific characteristics of the NAT/
   Firewall signaling protocol built upon it.

   GIST [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp] establishes NTLP "routing" state that
   allows signaling messages to be routed forwards and backwards along a
   path.  GIST also provides two ways to send signaling messages:

   1.  An RSVP-like signaling style with end-to-end addressed messages
       that contain the source and the destination IP addresses of the
       data flow.  The messages are intercepted along the path by NSIS
       nodes interested in these messages (by using Router Alert
       Options).  The GIST specification refers to this as the Datagram
       mode (D-mode).

   2.  Connection mode (or C-mode) is used when NSIS nodes are directly
       addressed.  This mode assumes that the discovery procedure has
       already finished (or the address of the receiving node is known
       via other means) and information about the node is already
       available.

   An important part of GIST is its discovery mechanism.  As an outcome
   of the discovery procedure the querying node learns the address of
   the responding node, its capability and establishes GIST routing
   state.

   Once the next NSIS aware node is known, a messaging association can
   be established between these two nodes using C-mode.  The same
   procedure is repeated again and again for the C-Mode until the last

Internet-Draft    Survey of Middlebox Control Protocols        July 2007


   GIST node is reached.

   The NAT/Firewall NSLP description [I-D.ietf-nsis-nslp-natfw] defines
   an NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) for configuration of network
   address translators and firewalls on top of GIST.

   The NATFW NSLP uses GIST as a transport for its signaling messages.
   Objects about a created NAT binding, as well as lifetime and
   signaling information (such as protocol headers and error messages)
   are contained in a NATFW NSLP message itself.  All other information
   about the flow identifier and the session identifier is carried in
   GIST.  For communication security between neighboring NATFW NSLP
   nodes the usage of Transport Layer Security (TLS) is specified.  The
   usage of an authorization token is possible
   [I-D.manner-nsis-nslp-auth]

   It is useful to distinguish between two signaling modes:

      The first mode (CREATE) is the traditional way of creating a NAT
      binding by sending a message from the data sender along the path
      to the data receiver.  Figure 1 shows a message exchange for this
      signaling mode.


      The second mode (EXTERNAL) is used when a data receiver is behind
      a NAT and wants to establish a NAT binding to allow incoming data
      traffic.  Figure 2 shows this mode.  It was necessary to introduce
      this mode, because of an end-to-end reachability problem.
      Furthermore, it provides a transition scenario where the data
      receiver behind a NAT or a firewall is able to configure their
      middlebox locally.

                   Figure 1: The NATFW NSLP CREATE Mode

   With the CREATE mode shown in Figure 1 the data sender (which happens
   to be the NSIS initiator in this case) sends a message to request a
   NAT binding to be created.  The message is targeted to the data
   receiver, which returns a success or failure in the RESPONSE message.
   The data sender learns about the new NAT binding with information
   carried in the RESPONSE message.

                  Figure 2: The NATFW NSLP EXTERNAL Mode

   With the EXTERNAL mode shown in Figure 2 the data receiver behind a
   NAT creates a NAT binding.  This allows data traffic from a node on
   the Internet to be received.  Please note that the EXTERNAL message
   is sent in the opposite direction of the data traffic.

4.2.  Protocol Analysis

   This section discusses the pros and cons of the protocol.

      Is the protocol is restricted to certain applications or network
      environments?

   The usage of the protocol is not restricted to a specific environment
   but to take advantage of its features it is necessary that Network
   Address Translators and firewalls implement this protocol.

      Does it require additional infrastructure, lower-layer features or
      cooperation from other entities?

   While the protocol supports a zero-configuration scheme so that it
   works in almost network topologies.  The protocol works with multiple

Internet-Draft    Survey of Middlebox Control Protocols        July 2007


   nested NATs and firewalls unless the data receiver is behind a
   complex network topology combined with routing asymmetry (without)
   state synchronization between the edge firewalls when the data sender
   does not support the protocol as well.

   To make use of the security functionality and to perform meaningful
   authorization capabilities it is, however, necessary to have some
   form of security infrastructure in place.  The protocol provides a
   very flexible security model with support in different security
   architectures.

   Furthermore,for the EXTERNAL signal mode to work it is necessary that
   the edge firewall or edge NAT towards the public Internet terminates
   the signaling message exchange since the message might be targeted
   towards an address that does not exist.

      Does it require modifications to applications?

   The protocol can be used in a proxy mode where no end host support is
   necessary.  In order to benefit best from the supported functionality
   is is advisable to make applications aware of the capability.

      How mature is the specification?  Has the protocol seen any use or
      deployment?

   The specification is passed Working Group Last Call and several
   implementations (including open source implementations) exist.
   However, the protocol is not deployed yet.

      How does the client discover the middlebox?

   The middlebox discovery is accomplished as part of the functionality
   provided in GIST, namely specifically crafted packets that look like
   data packets are used.  These discovery packets are marked with a
   router alert option and they are intercepted by firewalls and NATs
   along the path.

      What kinds of "pinholes" does the protocol support?

   The protocol supports a long range of pinholes.  The complete list
   can be found in Section 5.8.1.1 of GIST.

      What kinds of prior security arrangements does the protocol
      assume?

   When client authentication is required then the credentials of a
   ciphersuite available for TLS need to be available to the end host.
   The security architecture builds on a hop-by-hop security



Eggert, et al.          Expires January 10, 2008               [Page 10]

   architecture.  Alternatively, the usage of an authorization token is
   possible.  Authorization tokens can also be used in a non-hop-by-hop
   fashion.

   The security architecture is meant to provide strong security
   protection rather than opportunistic security mechanisms.  Further
   security mechanisms can be added without the need to re-define the
   protocol by plugging new security functionality into GIST or the
   NATFW NSLP and my making use of the initial capability exchange.

      Does it work if routers (not supporting this protocol) somewhere
      drop packets with IP options?

   GIST and the NATFW NSLP has problems if routers drop packets marked
   with the Router Alert option.  It is, however, possible to extend
   GIST with a different path-coupled signaling procedure.

      Does the protocol allow running a general-purpose server behind
      the NAT/firewall?

   Yes.

8.  UPnP - Internet Gateway Device Standardized Device Control Protocol

8.1.  Protocol Overview

   The Internet Gateway Device (IGD) is an "edge" interconnection device
   between a residential Local Area Network (LAN) and a Wide Area
   Network (WAN), providing connectivity to the Internet for the
   networked devices in the residential network.  The IGD could be
   physically implemented as a dedicated, standalone device or modeled
   as a set of Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP) devices and services on a

   personal computer.

   As an UPnP-based protocol, the IGD Standardized Device Control
   Protocol [UPNP] inherits the features that the UPnP Device
   Architecture provides for support zero-configuration, "invisible"
   networking, and automatic discovery for a breadth of device
   categories.  Any device can dynamically join a network, obtain an IP
   address, announce its name, convey its capabilities upon request, and
   learn about the presence and capabilities of other devices.  Devices
   can disconnect from the network automatically without leaving any
   unwanted state information behind.

   The IGD Standardized Device Control Protocol contains a set of
   devices and services that allow clients (in the UPnP context also
   called "Control Points") to control the initiation and termination of
   connections, monitor status and events of connections, or manage host
   configuration services, e.g., DHCP or Dynamic DNS.  Among these
   services, the "WANIPConnection" service provides the functionality
   that allows the Control Points to manage the network address
   translation on the IGD device.

   The IGD Standardized Device Control Protocol preserves the ability of
   non-UPnP devices to initiate and/or share Internet access.

8.2.  Protocol Analysis

   The IGD Standardized Device Control Protocol is intended to be used
   in unmanaged network environments such as those found typically in
   residential networks.  The residential network can have up to four
   segments, a limitation inherited from the UPnP Device Architecture,
   because the TTL value for the link-local multicast discovery messages
   is four.

   By design, the protocol does permit the presence of several
   residential gateways in the same network and also permits residential
   gateways to have multiple connections to the Internet.  In practice,
   a lack of routing mechanisms across multiple, simultaneously active
   WAN connections on multiple WAN interfaces and related issues caused
   by multiple, simultaneously active Internet Gateway devices (e.g.,
   default gateway conflict resolution, load balancing or fail over)
   make scenarios other than that of a single Gateway Device with a
   single Internet connection difficult to support.

   A residential gateway supporting the IGD Standardized Device Control
   Protocol is able to operate in two modes.  In "routed mode", the
   gateway shares the routable WAN IP address with the control points on
   the LAN using NAT.  In "bridged" mode, all Ethernet packets from
   devices on the LAN are bridged to the WAN.  In scenarios where the IP



Eggert, et al.          Expires January 10, 2008               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft    Survey of Middlebox Control Protocols        July 2007


   address on the WAN interface is not routable, the device can be
   switched from routed to bridged mode, allowing both the discovery of
   IGD Standardized Device Control Protocol devices further along the
   path as well as the use of other NAT hole-punching protocols.

   Applications that intend to create port mappings on a residential
   gateway supporting the IGD Standardized Device Control Protocol need
   to have embedded control point functionality, enabling them to create
   port mappings from TCP or UDP port on the external IPv4 address to
   the corresponding ports on the internal IPv4 addresses.

   The protocol is implemented in more than 90% of the consumer routers,
   although the functionality might not be enabled by default.


9.  NAT-PMP - NAT Port Mapping Protocol

9.1.  Protocol Overview

   The NAT Port Mapping Protocol [I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp] is a light-
   weight binary protocol running on top of UDP between client hosts and
   their IPv4 gateway.  Clients can send requests to their first-hop
   gateway on a well-known UDP port, in order to determine whether NAT-
   PMP is supported.  If that is the case, they will also learn the
   external IPv4 address of the gateway device.

   If the gateway supports NAT-PMP, a host can assume that it is behind
   a NAT and start sending request for mapping of external TCP or UDP
   ports on the external IPv4 address.  Mappings can be destroyed
   explicitly.  They also automatically expire after a timeout that can
   be negotiated per mapping, unless refreshed.

   Through the use of link-local multicast, the gateway can notify hosts
   if its external IP changes, and/or if it has rebooted.  In the latter
   case, hosts are expected to recreate any mappings.  This procedure
   attempts to protect against loss of state at the gateway.

   NAT-PMP assumes that there is one and only one NAT along the path,
   which also has to be the first-hop gateway.  A gateway must not
   enable NAT-PMP if it is does not perform address/port translation.

9.2.  Protocol Analysis

   NAT-PMP is applicable to small, unmanaged, non-routed networks,
   connecting multiple hosts to the IPv4 Internet through a single
   public IPv4 address.  It does not require any configuration.  Support
   from the gateway can be auto-detected by clients, and the trust model
   is solely based on network attachment.  There is no support for IPv6,



Eggert, et al.          Expires January 10, 2008               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft    Survey of Middlebox Control Protocols        July 2007


   nor is there support for transport protocols other than TCP or UDP.
   Nested NATs and non-NAT'ing firewalls are not supported.

   NAT-PMP covers the same use cases as [UPNP], although it is not as
   widely deployed today.  (NAT-PMP is currently mostly implemented by
   equipment from Apple Computer, Inc.).  The specification is recent,
   but nevertheless mature.

   Applications will normally need to be modified to explicitly request
   port mappings from the operating system, which would then operate the
   NAT-PMP state machine and message handling.  By design, the protocol
   allows applications to expose services to the outside, so hole-
   punching could conceivably be done automatically whenever an
   application listens to a local TCP port (although this would probably
   have unwelcome security implications).

12.  ALD - Application Listener Discovery for IPv6

12.1.  Protocol Overview

   Application Listener Discovery for IPv6 [I-D.woodyatt-ald] is a
   light-weight, binary protocol to explicitly punch holes through
   stateful IPv6 firewalls.  It uses ICMPv6 for signaling and is auto-
   configured through an explicit ICMPv6 router advertisement option.

   If the gateway supports ALD, a host can request the opening of holes
   for any incoming packet toward its own IPv6 address, based on one of
   multiple possible criteria:

   o  always

   o  an IP protocol (excluding IPv6 extension headers)

   o  for any standard transport protocol, a destination port number

   o  for IPsec ESP, an SPI value




Eggert, et al.          Expires January 10, 2008               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft    Survey of Middlebox Control Protocols        July 2007


   Holes automatically expire if not refreshed before a negotiated
   timeout.  The gateway can additionally notify hosts through
   unsolicited advertisements if it has rebooted or lost state.

12.2.  Protocol Analysis

   ALD is aimed at unmanaged IPv6 networks, where it might not be
   acceptable to pass any unsolicited packets coming from the outside
   toward any hosts in the internal network.  ALD needs support from all
   IPv6 routers within the network, because clients learn the ALD
   middlebox address through IPv6 Neighbor Discovery auto-configuration.
   It is expected that ALD will operate on the router itself in most
   cases.  As with IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, there is no authentication.

   The specification is currently a work-in-progress; there is no known
   deployment to date.  Applications would supposedly need slight
   modifications, similar as with [UPNP] or [I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp].

   ALD can handle "pinholes" for any transport protocol, although it is
   limited to IPv6 networks, and is meant to restore the ability to
   operate general-purpose servers behind stateful firewalls.  It
   currently does not explicitly support nesting, though ALD middleboxes
   could probably forward pinholes request in a hierarchical manner
   (from innermost to outermost device).
