Abstract

   This document specifies extensions to the RPSL language for dealing
   with 32 bit (4 byte) AS numbers.  It also gives a list of RPSL
   attributes that will be affected by this change and that may require
   tools to be updated.

Internet-Draft    RPSL extensions for 32 bit AS Numbers   September 2006


1.  Introduction

   Four byte (32 bit) AS numbers (ASN32) are defined in [as4bytes].
   This document does not specify a format to represent these numbers.
   A separate document [asn32rep] proposes to represent them as:

      <high order 16 bit value in decimal>.<low order 16 bit value in
      decimal>

   This format allows users to easily distinguish 16 and 32 bit ASN.

   RPSL (Routing Policy Specification Language) ([RFC2622] and
   [RFC4012]) uses the format "ASx" for an AS, with x a 1 to 5 digit
   number in the range 0 to 65535.  RPSL was defined before the
   introduction of 32 bit AS numbers (ASN32).

   Deployment of ASN32 will start early 2007 [asn32d].  To use these
   numbers in RPSL, the RPSL standard will have to be updated to allow
   for ASN32.  This document defines the necessary extensions to the
   RPSL standard.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Proposal

   The terms "2-byte only AS Numbers" and "4-byte AS numbers" are
   defined in [asn32rep].  Following this document, the field <as-
   number> in [RFC2622] (section 2) will be replaced by:

      An <as-number> is a string that can be either:

      *  ASx, for 2-byte only AS numbers, or
      *  ASy.z for 4-byte AS Numbers, with x and y using the same format
         as [asn32rep].
      x, y and z are integer numbers in the range 0 to 65535.  If y
      equals 0, it and the following "."  MUST both be dropped.  An
      application MAY accept a string with y equal to 0 as input.

   Similar, following [asn32rep] and [RFC2622], the definition of a
   community specification will be replaced by:

      An community specification is a string that can be either:

      *  x:N, for 2-byte only AS numbers, or
      *  y.z:N for 4-byte AS Numbers, with x and y using the same format
         as [asn32rep].
      x, y, z and N are integer numbers in the range 0 to 65535.  If y
      equals 0, it and the following "."  MUST both be dropped.  An
      application MAY accept a string with y equal to 0 as input.

   No other changes to the RPSL standard will be made.

2.1.  Background

   The proposed format ("ASx.y") for RPSL uses the same format for ASN32
   as had been proposed for other representations of ASN32.  This will
   allow for an easy conversion of data between RPSL-based tools and
   other tools.

   The format also has the advantage that the number of RPSL attributes
   will not change.  Proposals based on the RPSL language extension
   mechanism will all result in adding a large number of new attributes
   to RPSL.

   The format has the disadvantage that the code parsing RPSL data of
   existing tools will have to be update to allow for the new format.
   In other words, existing tools may break.  However, we believe that
   the advantages outweigh this disadvantage.

2.2.  Examples

   AS3333 refers to the AS with identifier 3333.  AS0.3333 refers to the
   same AS but this notation should not be used.  An identifier of
   AS65536 is not valid, even though the identifier can be expressed in
   a 32 bit integer.  This AS should be referred to as AS1.0.


3.  RPSL Attributes affected by this change

   The following table lists RPSL attributes that will be affected by
   this change.  It is intended as a check-list for developpers updating
   their tools.  In this table:

   o  A: the AS syntax used in this attribute has changed
   o  C: the community value syntax used in this attribute has changed

Internet-Draft    RPSL extensions for 32 bit AS Numbers   September 2006


4.  Security Considerations

   Many systems will treat strings "xxx.yyy" as real number values and
   convert this internally to floating point numbers.  One must take
   care that this will not happen.

   Systems may use unsigned 16-bit integers for the internal
   representation of AS numbers.  It should be checked that tools
   internally use (at least) an unsigned 32-bit number for ASN.

   Parsing ASN32 based communities attributes will result in longer byte
   strings.  It should be checked that tools internally have sufficient
   memory allocated to store these strings.  One possibility is to use
   the extensions to the 8 octet AS Extended Communities [RFC4360]
   proposed in A DRAFT THAT HAS EXPIRED BUT WILL BE REVIVED.


5.  IANA Considerations

   None.  (This section may be removed on publication as an RFC.)
