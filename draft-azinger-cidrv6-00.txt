CIDR for IPv6: Address Aggregation, Allocation, and Assignment Strategy
                        draft-azinger-cidrv6-00

Abstract

   This document discusses strategies for assigning and aggregating IPv6
   address space.  While CIDR was created to help alleviate this problem
   in regards to IPv4 addresses with the original [RFC1519] (and updated
   in [RFC4632]) we are now in need of a similar document to give
   direction for IPv6 addressing policies.  Similarly, [RFC1518]
   discussed how to use CIDR to allocate address space for IPv4, and
   [RFC1887] discusses the subject for IPv6.  The objective here is to
   update these documents and provide the best current guidance on how
   to manage address space in conjunction with managing the growth of
   routing tables in an IPv6 world.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet has continued to evolve and the demands placed on its
   infrastructure continue to grow at an increasing rate.  While there
   are a number of contributing factors there are a few key elements
   that have led to a concerning escalation in routing table growth and
   have made scalability an area of serious concern for network
   operators.  Effort must be put forward to minimize the impact of IPv6
   deployment to the routing system.  Two key aspects of this system
   include routing table churn composed of routing advertisements and
   withdrawals and the routing table size as measured by the number of
   entries in the DFZ, the Default-Free zone.  While retaining current
   Internet practices, this document addresses the problem of routing
   table size by examining steps to minimize the impact of Multi-homing
   and Traffic Engineering, two widely implemented features that provide
   enhanced network resiliency and traffic path control.

2.  Contributing factors to the problem

   There are several factors that work against routing table
   scalability.  A full description of the contributing factors and
   views can be read in [I-D.narten-radir-problem-statement].  The
   exhaustion of the unassigned IPv4 address space is the principal
   motivator resulting in two of the key growth drivers.  The first
   driver is the presence of increasingly longer prefixes in the DFZ
   Over the years the longest prefix generally accepted globally has
   increased from a relatively small number of classful prefixes to a
   preponderance of classless /24 CIDR prefixes.  As IPv4 address
   availability diminishes, more Internet users are and will continue to
   push their providers to route even longer prefixes externally that in
   the past were filtered.  This is something that we must look to
   minimize and find ways to deter as much as possible.

   The second driver resulting from IPv4 address exhaustion is the rapid
   uptake in IPv6 deployment by providers and end users.  This adoption,
   while clearly in the best interest for the long term viability of the
   Internet, contributes a unique set of challenges that must be
   addressed to promote efficient routing table growth.  Some of these
   challenges visible today are the liberal assignment of Provider
   Independent (PI) space to end users, micro-allocations, and critical
   network infrastructure allocations by the various RIRs.

   These drivers have increased the need for more guidance on routing
   policy in order to limit the number of unnecessary entries in the
   global routing table.  The future impact of this increased pressure
   on routing table growth is an area of immediate concern.

3.  Aggregation

   The common method for reducing state on both internal and external
   routing tables is through aggregation of information.  Borrowing from
   experience gained in operating IPv4 networks, in order for CIDR to
   succeed in reducing the global routing system growth rate, the IPv6
   address assignment process needs to make aggregation of routing
   information along topological lines.  In general, the topology of the
   network has not changed since IPv4 CIDR and even with IPv6 the
   topology of the network is still determined by the service providers
   who have built it. .  Topologically significant address assignments
   are necessarily service-provider oriented.

   Start of Excerpt from [RFC4632]
      The assignment of prefixes is intended to roughly follow the
      underlying Internet topology so that aggregation can be used to
      facilitate scaling of the global routing system.  One implication
      of this strategy is that prefix assignment and aggregation is
      generally done according to provider-subscriber relationships,
      since that is how the Internet topology is determined.
      Aggregation is simple for an end site that is connected to one
      service provider: it uses address space assigned by its service
      provider, and that address space is a small piece of a larger
      block allocated to the service provider.  No explicit route is
      needed for the end site; the service provider advertises a single
      aggregate route for the larger block.  This advertisement provides
      reachability and routeability for all the customers numbered in
      the block.
      There are two, more complex, situations that reduce the
      effectiveness of aggregation:
      *  An organization that is multi-homed.  Because a multi-homed
         organization must be advertised into the system by each of its
         service providers, it is often not feasible to aggregate its
         routing information into the address space of any one of those
         providers.  Note that the organization still may receive its
         address assignment out of a service provider's address space
         (which has other advantages), but that a route to the
         organization's prefix is, in the most general case, explicitly
         advertised by all of its service providers.  For this reason,
         the global routing cost for a multi-homed organization is
         generally the same as it was prior to the adoption of CIDR.  A
         more detailed consideration of multi-homing practices can be
         found in [RFC4116].
      *  An organization that changes service provider but does not
         renumber.  This has the effect of "punching a hole" in one of
         the original service provider's aggregated route
         advertisements.  CIDR handles this situation by requiring that
         the newer service provider to advertise a specific



Azinger, et al.         Expires December 31, 2010               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                CIDR for IPv6                    June 2010


         advertisement for the re-homed organization; this advertisement
         is preferred over provider aggregates because it is a longer
         match.  To maintain efficiency of aggregation, it is
         recommended that an organization that changes service providers
         plan eventually to migrate its network into a an prefix
         assigned from its new provider's address space.  To this end,
         it is recommended that mechanisms to facilitate such migration,
         such as dynamic host address assignment that uses [RFC2131]),
         be deployed wherever possible, and that additional protocol
         work be done to develop improved technology for renumbering.
   End of Excerpt from [RFC4632]

   It is important to recognize that some efficiency can still be gained
   with multi-homed sites (and in general, for any site composed of
   multiple, logical IPv6 networks).

   Start of Excerpt from [RFC4632]
      By allocating a contiguous power-of-two block address space to the
      site (as opposed to multiple, independent prefixes), the site's
      routing information may be aggregated into a single prefix.  Also,
      since the routing cost associated with assigning a multi-homed
      site out of a service provider's address space is no greater than
      the old method of sequential number assignment by a central
      authority, it makes sense to assign all end-site address space out
      of blocks allocated to service providers.
      It is also worthwhile to mention that since aggregation may occur
      at multiple levels in the system, it may still be possible to
      aggregate these anomalous routes at higher levels of whatever
      hierarchy may be present.  For example, if a site is multi-homed
      to two relatively small providers that both obtain connectivity
      and address space from the same large provider, then aggregation
      by the large provider of routes from the smaller networks will
      include all routes to the multi-homed site.  The feasibility of
      this sort of second-level aggregation depends on whether
      topological hierarchy exists among a site, its directly-connected
      providers, and other providers to which they are connected; it may
      be practical in some regions of the global Internet but not in
      others.
   End of Excerpt from [RFC4632]

4.  Allocation plan

   Allocations of /32 or shorter prefixes are best provided to network
   service providers from their regional registries.  RIR initial and
   subsequent allocation policy to service providers should allow for a
   minimum of 2 years worth of usage based on historical or business
   plan projections.  Organizations should be assigned appropriate
   subnets from their network service providers larger aggregate



Azinger, et al.         Expires December 31, 2010               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                CIDR for IPv6                    June 2010


   allocations that are in turn appropriately sized, such as /48 for
   organizations wishing to multi-home.

   Start of Excerpt from [RFC4632]
      Hierarchical delegation of addresses in this manner implies that
      sites with addresses assigned out of a given service provider are,
      for routing purposes, part of that service provider and will be
      routed via its infrastructure.  This implies that routing
      information about multi-homed organizations (i.e., organizations
      connected to more than one network service provider) will still
      need to be known by higher levels in the hierarchy.
      A historical perspective on these issues is described in
      [RFC1518].  Additional discussion may also be found in [RFC3221].
   End of Excerpt from [RFC4632]

   Similarly to the days of classful routing, IPv6 is following the same
   historical path of giving PI assignments.  It is in the interests of
   the network infrastructure to document a best practice for obtaining
   IPv6 addresses, and it is recommended that most, if not all, network
   numbers be distributed through service providers.  Using the process
   proposed in this document will support this from becoming a growing
   problem and will also reduce the scalability concerns core engineers
   face and the workload for Regional Registries.

5.  Current Statistics and Projections

   The good news is that IPv6 has started growing at a significant rate.
   The bad news is that IPv6 has started growing at a significant rate.
   Table 1 shows the observed growth for 2009.

              +----------------+---------+---------+--------+
              |                | Jan '09 | Dec '09 | Growth |

              +----------------+---------+---------+--------+

   There are several salient points that should be extracted from this
   table.  The first, and foremost, is that the routing table is now
   growing rapidly.  At 54% growth, this is faster than Moore's law
   would accommodate.  The roots are prefixes that have no 'less
   specifics' in the routing table.  Even at 50% growth per year, this

Internet-Draft                CIDR for IPv6                    June 2010


   number exceeds Moore's law.  More specifics are typically injected to
   support traffic engineering or multi-homing.

   The AS count growth shows the number of new organizations
   participating in BGP.  Transit ASes are routing domains that have
   multiple peer ASes.  Stub ASes are routing domains that have only a
   single peer AS.

5.1.  Analysis

   These numbers show that 610 new organizations have joined IPv6
   routing.  Of these new organizations, 85% are stub ASes.  The new
   organizations are injecting 860 new prefixes.  Of these, 76% are root
   prefixes.  Since any new AS must inject at least one prefix into
   routing to be counted, there would appear to be a very high
   correlation between new stub ASes and new root prefixes.  From this,
   it seems reasonable to conclude that the bulk of the new root
   prefixes are injected by stub ASes.  Further, since it seems unlikely
   that most of these stub ASes will turn into transit ASes in the
   future, it also seems reasonable to conclude that these organizations
   are actually end-user organizations who are injecting routes based on
   their PI address assignments.

   Thus, the bulk of the routing table growth appears to be due to PI
   prefix injection.

5.2.  Projections

   Given the high state of flux in the deployment of IPv6, it seems
   difficult to conclude that the statistics from 2009 will be
   representative of future routing table growth.  Thanks to the influx
   of new users who are being forced onto IPv6 by the impending IPv4
   runout, there are plausible arguments that would suggest that growth
   could accelerate.  There are also plausible arguments that suggest
   that as IPv6 deployment reaches ubiquity, that the growth might
   curtail in a logistic S-curve.  Lacking more data, it is difficult to
   clearly argue that either of these results is inevitable.

   It is possible, however, to look at the implications of the current
   growth rate, if it is sustained at the 2009 rate of 54%.  Table 2
   shows this growth rate:

5.3.  Impact of CIDR

   With the adoption of the plan outlined here, growth of the routing
   table in a default-free router is greatly reduced since most new
   address assignments will come from one of the large blocks allocated
   to the service providers.  This plan recognizes the continued need
   for multi-homing and the requirement to offer multi-homing via IPv6.
   Due to this requirement multi-homing will be the main reason for the
   continued growth of the routing table size but not because of
   independent subnet statements based solely on the desire for
   independence.

6.  Protocol

   This document requires that all parties implement routing protocols
   for IPv6 as previously published for IPv4 in [RFC4632].

7.  Rules for Route Advertisements

   This document requires that all parties follow the rules for route
   advertisements for IPv6 as previously published for IPv4 in
   [RFC4632].

8.  Responsibility of configuration and aggregation

   This document requires that all parties take responsibility of
   configuration or aggregation for IPv6 as previously published for
   IPv4 in [RFC4632].

9.  Procedural Changes

   It is possible that some organizations will need to alter their
   filters to follow the guidance of this document.  This is minimal and
   should not be considered an issue.

10.  Recommendations

   Internet Registries should begin to hand out IPv6 blocks of /32 or
   shorter to network service providers in order to accommodate both
   their growth and their customers' growth.  In addition Internet
   Registries should severely limit or eliminate the amount of PI
   assignments in order to help facilitate the decrease in routing table
   growth.  Service providers will allocate /48's to their customer
   organizations with multi-home requirements.  Implementation and
   deployment of these modifications should occur immediately.
