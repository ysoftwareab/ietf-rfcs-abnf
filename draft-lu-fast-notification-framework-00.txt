                draft-lu-fast-notification-framework-00

Abstract

   This document describes an architectural work that competes with the
   IP Fast Re-Route (IPFRR) solution which aims to minimize the network
   down time in the event of equipments failure.  The work provides a
   layered framework based upon which applications such as the domain-
   wide fast convergence may be achieved through the transport layer
   fast delivery of failure notifications.

1.  Introduction

   The ability to recover rapidly from network failures is one of the
   most sought network characteristics.  Few solutions address this
   issue to the satisfactory.

   IPFRR [RFC5714] is one such solution.  It mimics MPLS-FRR [RFC4090]
   solution.  The difference is that the MPLS-FRR is path based, or
   source routing based in other words.  This implies that the re-route
   decision can be carried out by the PLR (point-of-local-repair) router
   alone, with no need of cooperation of other LSRs in the network.

   Unfortunately, IP based FRR is by nature not source routing based.
   Its re-route decision may not be honored by other routers in the
   network.  The consequence can be very severe, either traffic outage
   or even routing loops.

   Many methods were proposed around IPFRR concept but none is close to
   be satisfactory.  Some methods such as LFA described in [RFC5286]
   require lot of computation and have coverage issue.  Some others such
   as Not-Via [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-notvia-addresses] are extremely
   complicated and are prohibitive to be useful.

   The primary reason for such difficulties can be understood from the
   following passage which is quoted from [RFC5714] first paragraph of
   section 1:

   However, there is an alternative approach, which is to compute backup
   routes that allow the failure to be repaired locally by the router(s)
   detecting the failure without the immediate need to inform other
   routers of the failure.

   The phrase "without the immediate need to inform other routers of the
   failure" is against the very nature of the IP network in which the
   domain-wide synchronization is the key.

   In this document we propose a method which directly addresses the
   rapid network synchronization needs.  It is not IPFRR based.  However
   it can achieve the same or better result without much complexity and
   compromise.

   The method lays out a framework which decouples the improvement in
   the forwarding plane from the control plane.  The design also allows
   and promotes future innovations based upon the framework.

2.  Event Framework

   An event framework is introduced for the purpose of rapid
   disseminating of events to all interested receivers in a network.

   The framework is application independent.  Many applications can
   generate the events and/or register to receive the events.  A TLV
   based framework is proposed to ensure separation between application
   and the delivery framework.

   The event framework is also independent of the underlying delivery
   mechanisms.  Different delivery mechanisms may be introduced, each
   with different properties suitable for different requirements.  For
   example, some delivery mechanism is solely optimized for simplicity;
   while other may improve on reliability.

   One of the use cases of this event framework is Fast Failure

Internet-Draft              Fast-Notification               October 2010


   Notification, which can be used to improve network convergence time.
   When a failure occurs in a network, routers adjacent to the failure
   can detect it and quickly disseminate the failure notifications to
   other routers throughout the area.  Routing protocols on different
   routers can register and receive such failure notifications, then
   quickly react to the failure to achieve fast convergence.

   The routing protocols discussed in this work are Interior Gateway
   Protocols (IGP) with the focus on the Link State Routing Protocols
   such as Open Shortest Path First [RFC2328] and Intermediate System to
   Intermediate System [RFC1195] [ISO.10589.1992].

   The event in the scope of this architecture is specifically the link-
   down event or node-down event.  The up events are not fast flooded
   for the sake of network stability.


3.  Layered Structure

   The framework can be viewed as a layered structure in which various
   routing functions can be rearranged.  This arrangement is based on
   the principle of separation of functions.  It will facilitate the
   innovation in various component building blocks and in the mean while
   allow them to integrate in a systematic manner.

   There are two layers that make the framework.  One is for routing
   protocol specific functionality.  The other is the data transport
   layer.  Figure 1 depicts this concept.

                 Figure 1: Fast Notification Architecture

   Regular routing protocol performs the flooding in store-and-forward
   manner.  While this is reliable (retransmission) and secure
   (adjacency check), it involves control plane operation and the
   control plane to data plane communication.  It inevitably drags the

   network-wide convergence.

   With the fast notification architecture, the delivery function is
   detached from the application layer and moved onto the transport
   layer.  More precisely, the transport layer provides domain-wide fast
   delivery platform.  The normal flooding function is still kept in the
   application layer to ensure ultimate synchronization in case the fast
   flooding does not reach some intended routers for whatever reasons.

   The speed of the fast flooding needs not to be faster than the data
   traffic.  As long as the messenger travels at the same speed of the
   data traffic, it always gives the next-hop router the same amount of
   time for processing as it gives the previous router.


4.  Operation

   Fast failure notification operates on following steps:

   1.  Failure detection;

   2.  Notification composing and dispatching;

   3.  Notification flooding;

   4.  Notification receiving;

   5.  Routing/forwarding table update.

4.1.  Failure detection

   This can be made in many ways.  But it has to be fast and light-
   weight.  Layer-2 link-event monitoring and signaling is obvious an
   option.  Bidirectional Forwarding detection (BFD) is also a good
   candidate.  There may be more, or combinations of them.

   The fast notification architecture encourages the innovation in this
   area which can be pursued freely and independently.

4.2.  Notification Origination

   This part involves the message format.  This document does not
   specify or endorse a particular format.  It is open to any format as
   long as it fulfills the fast flooding purpose.  The detecting router
   is responsible for the initiation of the fast notification process.
   Its action is the starting point of the fast flooding.

   There are two packet formats worth of mentioning.

Internet-Draft              Fast-Notification               October 2010


4.2.1.  IGP PDU

   The simplest approach is to use the IGP packet format directly.  For
   example, the OSPF Router-LSA packet which reflects a broken adjacency
   (one fewer router link) can be fast-flooded to all routers without
   special modification.

   The benefit is that the receivers can process the packet as usual.
   Moreover since the packet is no different than the one in normal
   flooding, it guarantees the seamless transition when the "slow"
   flooding catches up.  Plus, there will be no duplicate effort of fast
   and slow convergence.  Flooding stops wherever a router is updated
   (already fast flooded).

   The drawback is that the message cannot be made uniform for multiple
   protocols.  Other protocol such as IS-IS will have to devise a
   different format.  In addition, since IS-IS PDU is not IP based, it
   may require encapsulation in some cases.

   Another drawback is that the normal IGP flooding uses adjacency check
   to prevent DoS attack or PDU replay from un-trusted parties.  The
   check has to be bypassed for the fast-flooded packets to be accepted.
   This opens door to the DoS or some other attacks.  Domain-wide
   authentication may be adopted for protection.

4.2.2.  Uniform Message

   This format must include essential and sufficient information about
   the broken link.  The message will be treated on the receiver router
   as a local event.  The uniformed messaging provides freedom for
   future expansion.  The format thus is recommended TLV-based.

   Cautions must be taken in case the message is mistakenly flooded due
   to bugs or some error conditions.  Timeout machinery may be used to
   protect against such issues.

   The detecting router is responsible for the initiation of the fast
   notification process.  Its action is the starting point of the fast
   flooding.

4.3.  Fast Flooding

   The fast flooding does not specify the fast flooding mechanism.  It
   is up to the routing society to figure out and single out good
   solutions.  The requirement is that the flooding has to be

   a.  Reliable in that it reaches all participants even after failures
       occur;

   b.  Loop-free;

   c.  Simple;

   d.  Can be authenticated.

4.4.  Notification Receiving and Handling

   This involves upon the arrival of the notification message, how it is
   forwarded to the routing protocol for further processing.  If the
   fast-flooding scheme uses specific IP destination addresses or MAC
   addresses, the receiving router has to recognize it.

   When the message reaches the protocol process, it may have to relax
   its acceptance criteria.

   If in the future, some algorithm is developed that the notification
   handling takes very few CPU cycles, this process may be performed in
   real-time.  Therefore it is worthy of considering move the
   notification handling into the data plane.  This will cut a large
   chunk of delay and may lead to hitless domain-wide convergence.

4.5.  Routing/Forwarding Table Update

   This should be the same as normal IGP decision process.  It is also
   possible to pre-download the changes to the data plane if the
   complexity can be limited.  This will improve the overall convergence
   time dramatically.


5.  Convergence Analyses

5.1.  Definition of Convergence Time

   The convergence time is measured by dividing the number of lost
   packets with the traffic flow rate between any two routers in the
   domain.  This SHOULD equal to the domain wide network convergence
   time if all individual routers have the same computing power and the
   same convergence time.

5.2.  Domain Wide Convergence

   Due to the propagation delay, all routers do not converge at the same
   time.  The traffic loss, however, stops immediately after the first
   router repairs.



Lu, et al.               Expires April 21, 2011                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft              Fast-Notification               October 2010


   This is because the data traffic has to go through the same
   propagation delay, which exactly compensate the late starting of the
   convergence at remote routers.

   Take a ring topology for example, as shown in Figure 2.


                          Dest        Src
                           |           |
                          ---   ---   ---      ---
                          |A|---|B|---|C|...---|N|
                          ---   ---   ---      ---
                           |                    |
                           ----------------------

                          Figure 2: Ring Topology

   Assume all routers have same convergence time 50 milliseconds.
   Assume the transmission delay over each hop is 20 milliseconds.

   Upon link A-B failure, B floods its Link State Update to C. Table 1
   shows the convergence timeline.

              +------+-----------------+--------------------+
              | Node | Converge Starts | converge Completes |
              +------+-----------------+--------------------+
              | B    | 0               | 50ms               |
              | C    | 20ms            | 70ms               |
              +------+-----------------+--------------------+

   During the first 50 milliseconds, packets from B to A are dropped.
   Right after 50th milliseconds, B re-routes packets toward C. Those
   packets, after traveling 20 milliseconds, arrive C at 70th
   milliseconds when C is just repaired.  Since C and all downstream
   routers will correct themselves one by one right before those packets
   arrive, they will arrive at the destination via the corrected path
   successfully.  The overall convergence time is thus same as B's.

5.3.  Micro-looping

   If routers' convergence time is different, micro looping may form,
   although packets will still be delivered after several loops.  Still
   use Figure 2 for example.  Assume C needs 90 milliseconds to
   converge.  When B re-routes packets back to C at 70th milliseconds, C
   has not finished its updating yet.  It continues to use its old
   forwarding table and bounces packets back to B. B in turn re-route
   packets again to C. This time packets arrive at C at 110th
   milliseconds.  C has done updating and will forward packets

Internet-Draft              Fast-Notification               October 2010


   correctly.  The packets are looped once.

   The micro-looping does not form easily with Fast Flooding method.
   The routers have to differ in computing speed and differ
   significantly.

5.4.  Packet Reordering

   Due to the different convergence timeline, packets may be temporarily
   forwarded in wrong direction before being placed on the right track.
   This will not cause packet loss, but will result in packet
   reordering.

   Packet reordering affects TCP communication adversely in that new
   sequence numbered packets may arrive ahead of the older ones.

   This problem is common in IPFRR solutions, and remains an open issue.
   Not-Via for example, may have packets reordered when it switches to
   use the final stable routes from the temporary LFAs.  On the other
   hand, the connectionless network by nature never promises ordered
   packet delivery.  This type of problem deserves a separate topic and
   is beyond the scope of this document.


6.  Scalability Analyses

   Fast Flooding scales with networks of any size and any topology.  At
   least it scales no inferior to the normal IGP flooding.


7.  Traffic Analyses

   Traffics that did not route through the broken link are intact.
   Traffics that did will be successfully re-routed as soon as the
   affected router converges (as opposed to all routers converge).

   Upon the convergence of the affected router, Fast Flooding guarantees
   correct routes for all affected traffics.
