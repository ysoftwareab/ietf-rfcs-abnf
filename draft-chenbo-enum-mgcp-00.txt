Abstract

   MGCP decomposes a multimedia gateway into two parts, a call agent and
   a media gateway,thus brings greater extensibility and makes it easy
   to construct a large-scale VoIP network.  This document registers the
   MGCP Enumservice according to the guidelines given in RFC 3761
   [3].This kind of Enumservice is mainly applied in Carrier Networks.

1.  Introduction

   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [3]) is a system that uses DNS
   to translate telephone numbers into URIs.  By using DNS services like
   delegation through NS records and NAPTR records, one can look up what
   services are available for a specific E.164 number.

   As an improvement of H.323, MGCP assumes a call control architecture
   where the call control "intelligence" is outside the gateways and
   handled by external call control elements MGC(Media Gateway
   Controller)known as Call Agents, while MG(Media Gateway) is just
   responsible for the media conversion.  MGCP defines the interaction
   messages between them.  Moreover, MGCP assumes that these call
   control elements, or Call Agents, will synchronize with each other to
   send coherent commands and responses to the gateways under their
   control because MGCP does not define a mechanism for synchronizing
   Call Agents.

   This document registers the MGCP Enumservice according to the
   guidelines given in RFC3761 [3].  The MGCP Enumservice is used in the
   services field of a NAPTR resource record which indicates what class
   of functionality a given end point offers.  As shown in part 5.2,
   ENUM-MGCP is mainly used in carrier networks, making a unified
   addressing intra or inter MGCP system or even between other VoIP
   systems and MGCP systems.

3.  Address of record in MGCP

   The address of MGCP end-points includes two parts.  One is the domain
   name of attributive gateway, the other is the local name of this
   terminal in the gateway.  Local name uses the form of physical
   interface/circuit number.  For example, a MGCP address
   hrd4/56@gw23.example.net:5060 means that the attributive gateway is
   gw23.example.net, using port 5060, and the physical interface is hrd4
   , while the circuit number is 56.

4.  The 'E2U+MGCP' Enumservice

   Traditionally, the services field of a NAPTR record contains a string
   that is composed of two subfields: a 'protocol' subfield and a
   'resolution service' subfield.  ENUM in particular defines an 'E2U'
   (E.164 to URI) resolution service.  This document defines an 'E2U+
   mgcp' Enumservice for MGCP.  The scheme of the URI that will appear
   in the regexp field of a NAPTR record using the 'E2U+mgcp'
   Enumservice is 'mgcp'.

5.  Example of E2U+MGCP Enumservice and scenes for application

5.1.  Example of E2U+MGCP Enumservice

   The following is an example of the use of the Enumservice registered
   by this document in a NAPTR resource record.

   $ORIGIN 9.2.1.3.1.8.8.5.0.1.6.8.e164.arpa.

   IN NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+mgcp" "!^.*$!mgcp:hrd4/56@example.cn!" .

5.2.   The scenes for MGCP-ENUM application

   Part of MGCP's address of record is physical interface/circuit number
   which should be unknown to end-users, so ENUM-MGCP is not for one
   dedicated user but for carriers.With the help of ENUM-MGCP, the
   calls, no matter intra MGCP system, inter MGCP system, or from other
   VoIP systems, can have a unified addressing.

   There are three scenes as below.In these scenes, T1 represents
   terminal1,while T2 represents terminal2,and arrows show the call
   signal.

   Scene 1: the ENUM-based call procedure in the same MGCP system

   MGC1 receives a call request from T1.  After querying ENUM system,
   MGC1 has found that the call would terminate in the same MGCP system,
   then it makes a direct connection to MG12.

                  |MG11  | --------> |  MGC1  | --------> |  MG12 |
                  +------+           +--------+           +-------+
                    ^                    / ^                  \
                   /                        \
                                       /                        \
                 /                    v       \                  v
               +------+             +----------+             +-------+
               |  T1  |             |  ENUM    |             |  T2   |
               +------+             +----------+             +-------+

   the ENUM-based call procedure in the same MGCP system

   Scene 2: the ENUM-based call procedure among different MGCP systems

   MGC1 receives a call request from T1.  After querying from ENUM
   system, MGC1 has found that the call would terminate in another MGCP
   system, then it makes a connection to the relative call agent MGC2.

   the ENUM-based call procedure among different MGCP systems

   Scene 3: the ENUM-based call procedure between other VoIP systems and
   MGCP systems

   The call agent of other VoIP systems, such as sip or H.323 based
   systems, receives a call request from T1.  After ENUM query, it would
   find that the caller is MGCP-based.  It then makes a connection to
   the attributive MGC using a MGCP-based signal.
