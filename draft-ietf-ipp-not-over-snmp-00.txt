Abstract 

   This document is a submission to the Internet Printing Protocol
   Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
   Comments should be submitted to the ipp@pwg.org mailing list.  
   
   This document proposes a mapping of IPP notifications over SNMP,
   using new Printer Event and Job Event traps (to be added to the PWG
   Job Monitoring MIB [PWG-JOB]).  This mapping may be used to deliver
   printer notifications for any printer (not just IPP-capable ones) and
   also job notifications for any job (not just ones submitted via IPP).
   
   This document proposes:  (2) SNMP traps; (1) SNMP textual convention;
   and (4) SNMP leaf objects (for use in trap bindings).

Internet Draft        IPP Notifications over SNMP        10 October 1999



1.  Introduction

   The IPP protocol [IPP-PRO] supports passive monitoring of IPP Printer
   and Job objects, via client polling of IPP object attributes using
   the 'Get-Printer-Attributes' and 'Get-Job-Attributes' operations.  
   
   This IPP Notifications over SNMP mapping supports dynamic monitoring
   of IPP Printer and Job objects, via server generation of SNMP traps.
   
   
   1.1.  Terminology for Conformance
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted per [RFC-2119].  


2.  SNMP Network Management Framework

   See:  Section 1 'Introduction' and section 2 'Management Information'
         of IETF Coexistence between SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 [RFC-1908].
   
   See:  Section 1.1 'SNMPv1', section 1.2 'SNMPv2', and section 1.3
         'SNMPv3' of IETF Coexistence between SNMP Versions [V3-COEX].

   3.3.  Rules for Encoding Notifications
   
   Over some transports and/or media, the variable-bindings of these
   SNMP traps MAY not fit the MTU (maximum transmission unit) size.
   Conforming IPP Notification generators SHALL perform this procedure
   to ensure that all variable-bindings of these SNMP traps are always

Internet Draft        IPP Notifications over SNMP        10 October 1999

   included in the generated SNMP trap packet:  
   
   1)  Truncate all strings specified for variable-bindings
       to the reduced maximum sizes that are specified in their
       corresponding OBJECT clauses in their MODULE-COMPLIANCE.
   1a) If all variable-bindings now fit within the MTU,
       then exit this procedure and generate the SNMP trap.
   2)  Truncate the next one of the following string objects to
       the empty string (zero length in the ASN.1 BER encoding),
       in the order listed:
       - 'prtChannelInformation' (from Printer MIB v2 [PRT-MIB2])
       - 'prtGeneralPrinterName' (from Printer MIB v2 [PRT-MIB2])
       - 'jmEventSubscriberUserName'
       - 'jmEventSubscriberUserData'
       - 'jmAttributeValue...jobName.1'
   2a) If all variable-bindings now fit within the MTU,
       then exit this procedure and generate the SNMP trap.
   2b) If all variable-bindings do NOT fit within the MTU,
       then repeat step (2) for next string object.
   3)  If all variable-bindings do NOT fit within the MTU,
       then -> logic error (variable-bindings MUST now fit).
   
   
   3.4.  Registration for IPP Notifications
   
   IPP Clients may register for IPP Notifications delivered via SNMP by 
   either of the following methods:  
   
   
   3.4.1.  Registration via IPP
   
   IPP Create-Subscription and Job creation (Create-Job, Print-Job,
   Print-URI) operations MAY be used to create per-Printer or per-Job
   IPP Subscription objects and MAY specify 
   
     'notify-recipient' = 'ipp-snmp://hostname[.port]' 
   
   
   3.4.2.  Registration via SNMP
   
   SNMP Set-Request operations MAY be used to create appropriate rows in
   the SNMP Notification MIB defined in [RFC-2573] and MAY specify:  
   
   1)  'snmpNotifyTag'
       - tag of this notification - see 'snmpTargetAddrTagList' below
       - example "jmPrinterEventV2Event" or "jmJobEventV2Event"
   2)  'snmpNotifyType'
       - notification sent using either SNMP Trap (unacknowledged)
         or SNMP Inform-Request (acknowledged)
   3)  'snmpNotifyStorageType'
       - row persistence of this registration

Internet Draft        IPP Notifications over SNMP        10 October 1999

   
   
   SNMP Set-Request operations MAY be used to create appropriate rows in
   the SNMP Target MIB defined in [RFC-2573] and MAY specify:  
   
   1)  'snmpTargetAddrTDomain' and 'snmpTargetAddrTAddress'
       - target transport protocol and address (equivalent to URI)
   2)  'snmpTargetAddressTimeout' and 'snmpTargetAddrRetryCount'
       - retry timeout and limit (for acknowledged notifications
         delivered using SNMP Inform-Request rather than SNMP Trap)
   3)  'snmpTargetAddrTagList'
       - tags of notifications to be sent to this target (client)
       - example value "jmPrinterEventV2Event jmJobEventV2Event"
   4)  'snmpTargetAddrParamsEntry'
       - notification security and SNMP protocol version
   5)  'snmpTargetAddrStorageType'
       - row persistence of this registration
   
   
   3.5.  Relationship to other MIBs
   
   
   
   3.5.1.  IETF Host Resources MIB (RFC 1514)
   
   The 'jmPrinterEventV2Event' trap defined in this document includes a 
   'hrDeviceStatus' object for a device of type 'hrDevicePrinter'.  The
   'jmPrinterEventV2Event' trap defined in this document includes four
   objects from the IETF HR MIB [RFC-1514] in the variable-bindings:  
   
   - 'hrDeviceStatus' --> IPP 'printer-state'
   - 'hrPrinterStatus' --> IPP 'printer-state'
   - 'hrPrinterDetectedErrorState' --> IPP 'printer-state-reasons'
   - 'hrSystemDate' --> IPP 'printer-current-time'
   
   
   3.5.2.  IETF Printer MIB (RFC 1759)
   
   The 'jmPrinterEventV2Event' trap defined in this document includes a 
   'hrDeviceStatus' object for a device of type 'hrDevicePrinter'.  The 
   appropriate 'hrDeviceIndex' to use in the companion IETF Printer MIB 
   [RFC-1759] is indicated by the instance suffix of the variable's OID.
   
   
   3.5.3.  Printer MIB v2 (work-in-progress)
   
   The 'jmPrinterEventV2Event' trap defined in this document includes
   two objects from the (work-in-progress) Printer MIB v2 [PRT-MIB2] in
   the variable-bindings:

5.  IANA Considerations

   None - the only enumerated textual convention defined in this documen
   is proposed for addition to the PWG Job Monitoring MIB which is not a
   IETF standards track document.  The PWG does maintain a registration
   process for updates to the PWG Job Monitoring MIB.


6.  Internationalization Considerations

   The 'jmEventSubscriberUserName' text string defined in this document 
   of type 'JmUTF8StringTC' (UTF-8 stream-encoded ISO 10646/Unicode text
   defined in the PWG Job Monitoring MIB [PWG-JOB].  The natural languag
   of this object is inherently ambiguous (as it usually contains some
   transform of a personal name).


7.  Security Considerations

   This IPP Notifications over SNMP mapping defines only 'read-only'
   objects.  It is suitable for use with any version of SNMP, as no upda
   security is required (because no configuration updates are supported)
   
   No sensitive information is available via IPP Notifications over SNMP
