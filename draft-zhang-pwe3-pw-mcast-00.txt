1. Introduction 

   With a growing need for transmitting the multicast-based services 
   such as IP TV, DVB etc., it is necessary to support the efficient 
   transport of the multicast-based services in networks. The Working 
   Groups, such as MPLS and L2VPN, has begun to discuss the requirements 
   and solutions for multicast. In the same way, the solutions are 
   needed to support the multicast traffic over PW. 

   The purpose of this document is to propose procedures to transmit the 
   multicast traffic using the unidirectional Pseudowires (PWs), and

   describe the corresponding extensions to Label Distribution Protocol 
   (LDP). 

2. Terminology 

   The document defines the following additional terms: 

   - Point-to-Point Pseudo Wire (P2P PW). A PW that is bidirectional 
      and carries the essential elements of an emulated service from one 
      PE to the other PE over a PSN. 

   - Point-to-Multipoint Pseudo Wire (P2MP PW). A PW that has one ROOT 
      PE and one or more LEAF PEs, is a unidirectional tree and carries 
      the essential elements of an emulated service from ROOT PE to one 
      or more LEAF PEs over a PSN. 

   - P2MP PW ROOT Provider Edge (ROOT PE). Source of a P2MP PW, maps 
      multicast traffic into P2MP PW, also referred to as ingress PE of 
      multicast traffic. 

   - P2MP PW LEAF Provider Edge (LEAF PE). One of many potential 
      destinations of a P2MP PW, initiates the signaling message that 
      setup and tear-down P2MP PW, also referred to as egress PE of 
      multicast traffic. 

3. Overview of Solution 

   The current procedures for establishing a PW is described in [PWE3-
   CTRL], where typically an LDP session is established between two PEs 
   handling the point-to-point Pseudowire (P2P PW) End Service. 

   A solution to support multicast traffic may use the point-to-point 
   PWs across the provider network and the existing signaling procedures. 
   In this case, the ingress PE simply replicates and sends the 
   multicast packet for each egress PE over all corresponding PWs. 

   The solution has the advantage in ensuring the P and PE devices 
   isolated from the multicast issues. But this is not clearly optimal. 
   The replication is implemented on the PE, so it wastes bandwidth and 
   is only applicable to transmit the multicast traffic with the low 
   bandwidth and the small egresses. 

   Thus the other mechanisms are required to efficiently support the 
   multicast-based services. The point-to-multipoint unidirectional PWs 
   similar to the multicast tree may be constructed to transmit the 
   multicast-based services. It may overcome the limitation of the 
   above-mentioned solution and need to extend the existing LDP protocol.

   In this instance, the PSN tunnel used to carry the point-to-
   multipoint PW (P2MP PW) may consist of a P2MP LSP, or multiple P2P 
   and P2MP LSPs, and may be pre-provisioned or dynamically established 
   by LDP[P2MP-LDP] or RSVP[P2MP-RSVP] signaling. A PSN tunnel may carry 
   one or more P2MP PWs. 

   A P2MP PW consists of a single ROOT PE, and one or more LEAF PEs. The 
   ROOT PE must have a targeted LDP session with each of LEAF PEs. The 
   LEAF PEs initiate P2MP PW setup and tear-down. The ROOT PE installs 
   forwarding state to map traffic into the P2MP PW. A P2MP PW emulates 
   a unidirectional service from the ROOT PE to the LEAF PEs. 

   For multicast-based service, only a single copy of packet needs to be 
   transmitted, and can only carry one PW label. So the all LEAF PEs 
   should assign the same PW label for the same P2MP PW. 

   Upstream label allocation is proposed in [MCAST-OVER-P2MP] and [LDP-
   UPSTREAM]. The ROOT (upstream) PE is responsible for coordinating, 
   allocating, and distributing the labels used by the LEAF PEs so that 
   a single copy of the labeled packet may be sent to all LEAF PEs. 

   In this document, the solution proposed use the upstream label 
   allocation for establishing P2MP PWs cross a single domain, and the 
   PSN tunnel is a pre-provisioned or dynamically established P2MP LSP.  

   The P2MP PWs cross the multiple domains and a PSN tunnel consisting 
   of multiple P2P and P2MP LSPs, will be discussed in the next version. 

4. Reference Model for P2MP PW

   PE1, PE2, PE3 and PE4 provide multicast-based service, i.e.PW1, to 
   CE1, CE2, CE3 and CE4. These PEs reside in same PSN domain. A PSN 
   P2MP tunnel is used to connect the attachment circuits (ACs) attached 
   to PE1 to the corresponding ACs attached to PE2, PE3 and PE4. PE1 is 
   ROOT PE, and PE2, PE3, PE4 are LEAF PEs. 

   Another multicast-based service is also carried in the same PSN P2MP 
   tunnel, i.e.PW2. PE1 is ROOT PE, and PE2, PE3 are LEAF PEs.

5. Signaling Procedures 

   For the upstream label allocation, the ROOT PE allocates and 
   advertises the labels for a P2MP PW, and it solves the issue of 
   coordination of labels between the LEAF PEs for a P2MP PW. 

5.1. Setup 

   The setup procedures for upstream label allocation are shown in 
   Figure 2. 

   A LEAF PE wishing to join to a P2MP PW sends a Label Request message 
   to request upstream label allocation. The message contains the 
   multicast FEC TLV identifying a P2MP PW and the Upstream-Assigned 
   Label Request TLV indicating to request upstream label allocation. 

   The ROOT PE receiving such Label Request message verifies the 
   multicast FEC TLV and responds a Label Mapping message with an 
   allocated label in the Upstream-Assigned Label TLV for the multicast 
   FEC TLV. 

   The ROOT PE will allocate the same label for the LEAF PEs sending 
   Label Request message with the same multicast FEC TLV. 

   If the LEAF PE, receiving a Label Mapping message with an Upstream-
   Assigned Label TLV, does not recognize the TLV, it MUST respond a 
   Notification message with a status code "Unknown TLV" [RFC3036]. If 
   it does recognize the TLV but is unable to process the allocated 
   label, it MUST respond a Notification message with a status code of 
   "No Label Resources". 

           ROOT PE                      LEAF PEs 
             |                                 | 
             |  Label Request (Request TLV)    | 
             |<--------------------------------| 
             |  Label Mapping (allocate Label) | 
             |-------------------------------->| 
             |                                 | 
                                                   
                    Figure 2 Upstream label allocation 

5.2. Teardown 

   When the ROOT PE receives a Label Withdraw message with a multicast 
   FEC TLV from a LEAF PE, it snips off the LEAF PE from the 
   corresponding P2MP PW. 

 
 
Zhang                  Expires August 21, 2006                [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft    draft-zhang-pwe3-pw-mcast-00.txt       February 2006 
    

   Until the ROOT PE removes the final LEAF PE, the P2MP PW is tore down. 
   The ROOT PE releases the label and removes the forwarding state to 
   map traffic into the P2MP PW. 

6. Capability Negotiation Procedures 

   During P2MP PW setup process, the PEs need to exchange some 
   information and learn each other's capability, e.g. the usage of PW 
   status TLV and control word and so on. For a P2MP PW, all LEAF PE and 
   ROOT PE must agree on the capability. 

   For upstream label allocation, the ROOT PE decides the capability of 
   the P2MP PW, i.e., if the LEAF PE does not support the capability the 
   ROOT PE does, it will be unable to join to the corresponding P2MP PW. 

6.1. PW Status 

   If a PW Status TLV is contained in a message (Label Request for LEAF 
   PEs, Label Mapping for ROOT PE), it indicates that the PE supports 
   the PW Status TLV. 

   If the ROOT PE supports the PW Status TLV, and receives the Label 
   Request message not including a PW Status TLV, then the ROOT PE 
   responds with the Label Release message including the new defined 
   status code "Using PW Status TLV not consistent". The LEAF PE will be 
   unable to join to the P2MP PW. 

   If the ROOT PE does not support the PW Status TLV, and receives the 
   Label Request message including a PW Status TLV, then the ROOT PE 
   responds with the Label Mapping message not including the PW Status 
   TLV. The P2MP PW will revert to the label withdraw method of 
   signaling PW status. The ROOT PE will automatically ignore the PW 
   Status TLV in which the U bit (Unknown message bit) is set. The LEAF 
   PE may join to the P2MP PW. 

6.2. Control Word 

   If the C-bit (Control Word bit) of multicast FEC TLV in message is 
   set, i.e. C=1, it indicates that the PE sending message supports the 
   control word. 

   - The control word is REQUIRED for the PW type. If the ROOT PE, that 
      receives the Label Request message of a LEAF PE with C=0, MUST 
      respond a Label Release message with an "Illegal C-bit" status 
      code. And the LEAF PE will be unable to join to the P2MP PW.  

   - The control word is NOT mandatory for the PW type. 
 
 
Zhang                  Expires August 21, 2006                [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft    draft-zhang-pwe3-pw-mcast-00.txt       February 2006 
    

     If the ROOT PE, that supports the use of the control word, receives 
     the Label Request message of a LEAF PE with C=0, then the ROOT PE 
     sends a Label Release message with a "Wrong C-bit" status code. And 
     the LEAF PE will be unable to join to the P2MP PW. 
     If the ROOT PE, that does not support the use of the control word, 
     receives the Label Request message of a LEAF PE with C=1, it 
     responds a Label Mapping message with C=0. The LEAF PE receiving 
     such message sends a Label Withdraw message with a "Wrong C-bit" 
     status code, and may initiate a Label Request message with C=0 over 
     again. And the LEAF PE will be accepted. 

7. Potential Issues 

   Upstream label allocation may be used only when both the ROOT PE and 
   the LEAF PE support it, i.e. the ROOT PE need negotiate the 
   capability supporting upstream label allocation with the LEAF PEs. 

   If some of LEAF PEs support upstream label allocation and some of 
   LEAF PEs do not, a P2MP PW will be established between the ROOT PE 
   and all those LEAF PEs that can support upstream label allocation, 
   and the individual P2P PWs will be established from the ROOT PE to 
   each of the LEAF PEs that do not support it. 

   The signaling mode of the "Upstream label allocation" differs from 
   the existing P2P PW that uses LDP in its "downstream unsolicited" 
   mode. 

8. LDP Extensions 

   The solutions described above require several protocol extensions to 
   LDP. 

8.1. FEC Element 

   The multicast FEC TLV includes a P2MP PW FEC Element to identify a 
   P2MP PW.  

   The two new FEC Element types, P2MP PWid FEC Element and P2MP 
   Generalized PWid FEC Element, are defined corresponding to PWid FEC 
   Element and Generalized PWid FEC Element in [PWE3-CTRL]. A P2MP PW 
   may be identified using alternative FEC Elements.

   The LEAF PE must know the address of the ROOT PE and a TAI by 
   manually configured or dynamically learned for using P2MP PW 
   Generalized PWid FEC element.  

   When the ROOT PE receives an originating message (Label Request) from 
   a LEAF PE, it will verify the multicast FEC TLV in such message. 

   If it can not map the TAI in multicast FEC TLV to one of its 
   Forwarders, then it sends a Label Release message to the LEAF PE with

   a status code "Unassigned/Unrecognized TAI". The LEAF PE will be 
   unable to join to the P2MP PW. 

   If it can map the TAI to one of its Forwarders, the establishment 
   procedures of the P2MP PW will continue. 

   In nature, a TAI of the ROOT PE may uniquely identify a P2MP PW. 

8.2. Status TLV 

   The Label Request message may include the PW Status TLV. 

   A new LDP status code is defined for "Using PW Status TLV not 
   consistent", and it needs to be assigned by [IANA]. 

9. Sequencing Considerations 

   Support for sequencing depends on the PW type, and implemented by the 
   sequence number field in the control word. It may be omitted if not 
   needed. 

   In case of supporting sequencing, it must be assured to wait a 
   sufficient interval before re-using the released label. Otherwise the 
   residual packets will be intermixed with the new starting packets, 
   and the LEAF PEs will receive the packets with orderless sequencing 
   numbers. Some packets will be rejected. 

10. Security Considerations 

   A PSN tunnel consisting of a pre-provisioned P2MP LSP may carry one 
   or more P2MP PWs, but these P2MP PWs may include the different sets 
   of LEAF PEs. This means that the traffic for a P2MP PW will be 
   delivered to the LEAF PEs of the other P2MP PWs. 

   This issue will be discussed in the future. 

11. IANA Considerations 

   This document requires IANA to define the following new FEC element 
   types. 

   FEC element Type   Description 

   TBD            P2MP PWid FEC Element 

   TBD            P2MP Generalized PWid FEC Element

   A new Status Code appears in section 4.2.1, 5.2.1, and 6.2.1, which 
   needs assignment by IANA. 

   Status Code       Description 

   TBD            "Using PW Status TLV not consistent"
