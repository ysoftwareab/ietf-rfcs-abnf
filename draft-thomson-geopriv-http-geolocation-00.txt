Abstract

   A Geolocation header is defined for HTTP.  The Geolocation header
   provides a reference to location information in an HTTP request.  A
   server can use this information in processing the request.

Internet-Draft              HTTP Geolocation                  March 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a header for Hypertext Transfer Protocol
   (HTTP) [RFC2616] that includes a reference location information.

   The "Geolocation" request header includes a URI to a resource that
   includes location information.  A server can choose to use this
   information in serving the request.  How this affects the response is
   up to the server, but this could be used to select content that is
   more appropriate for a recipient at the given location.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and indicate requirement
   levels for compliant implementations.

   Some terminology from [I-D.ietf-geopriv-arch] is used.


3.  Geolocation Header

   The "Geolocation" header is a end-to-end request header that includes
   a reference to location information.  This reference is an absolute
   URI [RFC3986] that identifies a resource that contains location
   information.

   The following ABNF [RFC5234] defines the syntax of the Geolocation
   header.  This ABNF uses the modified syntax and existing rules for
   HTTP from [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging].

   Geolocation-Header = "Geolocation:" OWS "<" absolute-URI ">"
                        *geoloc-param
   geoloc-param       =  OWS ";" OWS token [ "=" word ]

   The value of location information can be carried in the body of a
   request using a "cid:" URI [RFC2392].  The "geo:" URI
   [RFC5870]provides another means of including location information
   directly.

   Location information that is included by reference to an independent
   resource means that the server has some control over how location
   information is acquired.  Depending on the needs of the server, it
   may need to follow this reference before responding to the request.

Internet-Draft              HTTP Geolocation                  March 2011


   A location that is provided by reference to a constantly updating
   resource could permit a server to request information that better
   suits their end by a variety of methods.  Content negotiation, HTTP-
   Enabled Location Delivery [I-D.ietf-geopriv-deref-protocol] and
   location filtering [I-D.ietf-geopriv-loc-filters] could be used,
   depending on the type and capabilities of the identified resource.
   Providing location by reference allows a server to request location
   information some time after receiving the request, enabling
   applications that operate outside the time of the client-server
   interaction.  This has potential privacy implications, see Section 6.

   Servers that implement support for the Geolocation header MUST
   support "cid:", "https:" and "http:" URIs.  Servers MUST support
   location information in the form of a Presence Information Data
   Format - Location Object (PIDF-LO) [RFC4119].

   A client SHOULD NOT include multiple Geolocation headers in the same
   request.  Though it is permitted, a server that doesn't have
   additional information about each URI might find it difficult to
   select a single location or reconcile different locations.
   [I-D.ietf-sipcore-location-conveyance] provides a discussion on the
   consequences of including multiple location values.

   Resources that provide different representations based on the value
   of the Geolocation header typically need a Vary header containing
   "Geolocation" if they can be cached.


4.  427 (Bad Geolocation) Status Code

   A status code of 427 indicates that the request contained missing,
   badly formed, unsupported or inaccessible location information.

   This indicates that a request might be successful if it contained
   different location information.  The client might:

   o  include a Geolocation header (after gaining permission), if one
      was absent

   o  include a location value directly, if a location reference was
      provided

   o  include a different URI type, if alternatives are available

   o  modify any authorization rules on the identified resource to
      permit the server access

   A representation included in the response SHOULD provide what

   guidance the server can provide the client in providing a request
   that will succeed.


5.  Examples

   In the following example, location is included by value.  The
   Geolocation header references a PIDF-LO document in the body of the
   request.

   GET /resource HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com:8443
   Geolocation: <cid:rf*c36n89@r.213562>
   Content-ID: <rf*c36n89@r.213562>
   Content-Length: TBD
   Content-Type: application/pidf+xml

   <presence xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf"
             xmlns:gp="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10"
             xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml"
             xmlns:gs="http://www.opengis.net/pidflo/1.0"
             entity="pres:circle@example.com">
     <tuple id="circle">
       <status>
         <gp:geopriv>
           <gp:location-info>
             <gs:Circle srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326">
               <gml:pos>42.5463 -73.2512</gml:pos>
               <gs:radius uom="urn:ogc:def:uom:EPSG::9001">
                 850.24
               </gs:radius>
             </gs:Circle>
           </gp:location-info>
           <gp:usage-rules/>
           <gp:method>OTDOA</gp:method>
         </gp:geopriv>
       </status>
     </tuple>
   </presence>

   In the following example, location is included by reference to an
   HTTP resource.

   GET /resource HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com:8443
   Geolocation: <https://lis.example.net/location/scey89pse>

Internet-Draft              HTTP Geolocation                  March 2011


   In the following example, an error response indicates that the
   Geolocation was not accessible by the server.

   HTTP/1.1 427 Bad Geolocation
   Host: example.com:8443
   Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8
   Content-Length: 95

   <https://lis.example.net/location/scey89pse> was not accessible.
   HTTP Error: 403 Forbidden


6.  Privacy Considerations

   Location information is highly privacy-sensitive.  A discussion of
   the privacy considerations as they relate to location information in
   general, and a terminology framework can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-arch].  Most importantly, a client MUST NOT send
   location information without the permission of a Rule Maker.

   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-arch] defines rules for the server that are
   included in the Location Object [RFC4119].  A conforming server MUST
   respect the rules regarding location retention and retransmission in
   PIDF-LO.

   Confidentiality protection, as provided by HTTP over TLS [RFC2818]
   MUST be used to protect location information, unless other forms of
   protection are provided, or a Rule Maker has provided permission for
   information to be universally distributed.  This applies whether the
   request contains location information by value or by reference; the
   guidance in [RFC5808] recommends confidentiality protection for some
   URIs that reference location.

   Location information that is included by reference to a resource
   allows the server to retrieve location information outside of the
   context of the request.  An access control policy on the referenced
   resource may be used to control access.

   The privacy considerations for this document are similar to those for
   SIP location conveyance [I-D.ietf-sipcore-location-conveyance], with
   one major exclusion.  The intermediary architecture for HTTP doesn't
   support routing in the same way that SIP does and routing based on
   location information is not possible in the same manner.  For this
   reason, the privacy concerns relating to routing and the related
   "Routing-Allowed" header are not relevant to HTTP.

7.  Security Considerations

   In addition to the privacy considerations, HTTP over TLS [RFC2818]
   provides integrity protection for location information on a hop-by-
   hop basis.

   Servers that support Geolocation headers need to be aware of the
   potential attacks that accepting URIs provided by clients could
   enable.  The security considerations of [RFC3986] contains guidance
   on using URIs.
