                   BMP Extension for Path Marking TLV
                draft-cppy-grow-bmp-path-marking-tlv-02

Abstract

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides an interface for obtaining
   BGP Path information.  BGP Path Information is conveyed within BMP
   Route Monitoring (RM) messages.  This document proposes an extension
   to BMP to convey the status of a BGP path after being processed by
   the BGP best-path selection algorithm.  This extension makes use of
   the TLV mechanims described in draft-lucente-bmp-tlv
   [I-D.lucente-bmp-tlv].

1.  Introduction

   For a given prefix, multiple paths with different path status, e.g.,
   the "best-path", "back-up path" and so on, may co-exist in the BGP
   RIB after being processed by the local policy and the BGP decision
   process.  The path status information is currently not carried in the
   BGP Update Message RFC4271 [RFC4271] or in the BMP Update Message
   RFC7854 [RFC7854].

   External systems can use the path status for various applications.
   The path status is commonly checked by operators when performing
   troubleshooting.  Having such status stored in a centralized system
   can enable the development of tools facilitating this process.

   Optimisation systems can include the path status in their process,
   and also use the status as a validation source (since it can compare
   the calculated state to the actual outcome of the network, such as
   primary and backup path).  As a final example, path status
   information can complement other centralized sources of data, for
   example, flow collectors.

   This document defines a so-called Path Marking TLV to convey the BGP
   path status information to the BMP server.  The BMP Path Marking is
   defined to be prepended in the BMP Route Monitoring (RM) Message.

2.  Path Marking TLV for the RM Message

   As per RFC4271 [RFC4271], the BMP RM Message consists of the Common
   Header, Per-Peer Header, and the BGP Update PDU.  According to draft-
   lucente-bmp-tlv [I-D.lucente-bmp-tlv] , optional trailing data in TLV
   format is allowed in the BMP RM Message to convey characteristics of
   transported NLRIs (i.e. to help stateless parsing) or vendor-specific
   data.  Such TLV types are to be defined for each application.

   To include the path status along with each BGP path, we define the
   Path Marking TLV, shown as follows.

      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     |E|                    Reason Code(variable)                    |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                          Figure 1: Path Marking TLV

   o  Type = TBD1 (2 Octets): indicates that it's the Path Marking TLV.

   o  Length (2 Octets): indicates the length of the value field of the
      Path Marking TLV.  The value field further consists of the Path-
      Status field and Reason Code field.

   o  E bit (1 Bit) for Path Status: indicates if any enterprise-
      specific path status is used after the IANA-registered path status
      code.

   o  Path Status (4 Octets): indicates the path status of the BGP
      Update PDU encapsulated in the RM Message.  Currently 7 types of
      path status are defined, as shown in Table 1.

   o  E bit (1 Bit) for Reason Code: indicates if any enterprise-
      specific reason code is used after the IANA-registered reason
      code.

   o  Reason Code (Variable): indicates the reasons/explanations of the
      path status indicated in the Path Type field.  The detailed Reason
      Code field is defined in Section 2.2.

2.1.  Path Status

   The Path Status field contains a bit field where each bit encodes a
   specific role of the path.  Multiple bits may be set when multiple
   path status apply to a path.

   Two encoding options for Path Status are described in the following
   two sections.

2.1.1.  IANA-registered Path Status Encoding

       +-------------------------------+

                 Figure 2:  IANA-registered encoding of Path Status

   o  E bit (1 Bit): set to 0, indicating that only IANA-registered path
      status is used in this TLV.

   o  IANA-registered Path Status (2 octets): indicates the IANA-
      registered path status, as specified in Table 1.

                     +--------+----------------------+
                     | Value  | Path type            |

                     | 0x0000 | Unknown              |
                     | 0x0001 | Invalid              |

   The best-path is defined in RFC4271 [RFC4271] and the best-external
   path is defined in draft-ietf-idr-best-external
   [I-D.ietf-idr-best-external].

   An invalid path is a route that does not enter the BGP decision
   process.

   A non-selected path is a route that is not selected in the BGP
   decision process.  In other words, Best route and ECMP routes are not
   considered as non-selected.

   A primary path is a recursive or non-recursive path whose nexthop
   resolution ends with an adjacency draft-ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic].  A prefix can have more than one primary
   path if multipath is configured draft-lapukhov-bgp-ecmp-
   considerations [I-D.lapukhov-bgp-ecmp-considerations].  A best-path
   is also considered as a primary path.

   A backup path is also installed in the RIB, but it is not used until
   some or all primary paths become unreachable.  Backup paths are used
   for fast convergence in the event of failures.

   A non-installed path refers to the route that is not installed into
   the IP routing table.

   For the advertisement of multiple paths for the same address prefix
   without the new paths implicitly replacing any previous ones, the
   add-path status is applied RFC7911 [RFC7911].

2.1.2.  Enterprise-specific Path Status Encoding

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

       Figure 3: Enterprise-specific encoding of Path Status

   o  E bit (1 Bit): set to 1, indicating enterprise-specific path
      status is used in this TLV.

   o  Enterprise-specific Path Type (4 octets): indicates enterprise-
      specific path status, which remains to be defined.

   o  Enterprise Number (4 octets): indicates the IANA enterprise number
      IANA-PEN.

2.2.  Reason Code

   The Reason Code field contains a bit field where each bit encodes a
   specific reason.  Multiple bits may be set when multiple reasons
   apply to a path.

2.2.1.  IANA-registered Reason Code Encoding

      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

               Figure 4:  IANA-registered encoding of Reason Code

   o  E bit (1 Bit): set to 0, indicating that only IANA-registered
      reason code is used in this TLV.  With the E bit set to 0, the
      Length field of the Path Marking TLV SHOULD be set to 8.

   o  IANA-registered Reason Code (4 octets): indicates the IANA-
      registered reason code of the path status.

2.2.2.  Enterprise-specific Reason Code Encoding

       Figure 5: Enterprise-specific encoding of Reason Code

   o  E bit (1 Bit): set to 1, indicating enterprise-specific reason
      code is also used in this TLV.

   o  IANA-registered Reason Code (4 octets): indicates the IANA-
      registered reason code of the path status.

   o  Enterprise Number (4 octets): indicates the IANA enterprise number
      IANA-PEN.

   o  E-specific Reason Code (Variable): indicates enterprise-specific
      reason code of the path status.
