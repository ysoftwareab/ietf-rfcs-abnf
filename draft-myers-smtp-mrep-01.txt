1.  Abstract

   SMTP [SMTP] [HOST-REQ] and its service extensions [ESMTP] provide a
   mechanism for transferring mail reliably and efficiently.  The design
   of the SMTP protocol effectively requires the receiver-SMTP to manage
   a mail delivery queue.

   In some limited circumstances, outside the area of mail exchange
   between independent hosts on public networks, it is desirable to
   implement a system where a mail receiver does not manage a queue.
   This document describes an extension command which modifies the SMTP
   protocol to accommodate this situation.

   This extension is one which should be used only by specific prior
   arrangement and configuration.  Its use by a sender-SMTP should not
   be triggered by availability, therefore the extension is not given an
   ESMTP EHLO keyword.

2.  Conventions Used in this Document

   In examples, "S:" and "R:" indicate lines sent by the sender-SMTP and
   receiver-SMTP respectively.

3.  Introduction and Overview

   The design of the SMTP protocol effectively requires the receiver-
   SMTP to manage a mail delivery queue.  This is because a single mail
   transaction may specify multiple recipients and the final "." of the
   DATA command may return only one reply code, to indicate the status
   of the entire transaction.  If, for example, a receiver-SMTP is given
   a transaction for two recipients, delivery to the first succeeds, and
   delivery to the second encounters a temporary failure condition,
   there is no mechanism to inform the sender-SMTP of the situation.
   The receiver-SMTP must queue the message and later attempt to deliver
   it to the second recipient.

   This queuing requirement is beneficial in the situation for which
   SMTP was originally designed: store-and-forward relay of mail between
   networked hosts.  In some limited situations, it is desirable to have
   a receiver-SMTP which does not manage a queue, instead relying on the
   sender-SMTP to perform queue management.  As an example, consider a
   hypothetical host with a mail system designed as follows:

   The host's mail system has three independent, communicating
   subsystems.  The first is a queue manager, which acts as a
   traditional SMTP agent, transferring messages to and from other hosts
   over TCP and managing a mail queue in persistent storage.  The other
   two are agents which handle delivery for addresses in domains for
   which the host takes responsibility.  One agent performs gatewaying
   to and from some other mail system.  The other agent delivers the
   message into a persistent mail spool.

   It would be desirable to use SMTP over a local inter-process
   communication channel to transfer messages from the queue manager to
   the delivery agents.  It would, however, significantly increase the
   complexity of the delivery agents to require them to manage their own
   mail queues.

   The MREP extension permits the receiver-SMTP to return, after the
   final "." of the DATA command, one reply for each recipient.
   Therefore, if the queue manager is configured to use SMTP with the
   MREP extension when transferring messages to the delivery agents,
   then the delivery agents may attempt delivery to each recipient after
   the final "." and individually report the status for each recipient.
   Connections which should use the MREP extension are drawn in the
   diagram above using asterisks.

   Note that it is not beneficial to use the MREP extension when
   transferring messages to the queue manager, either from the network
   or from a delivery agent.  The queue manager does implement a mail
   queue, so it may store the message and take responsibility for later
   delivering it.

4.  The MREP command

   As the MREP extension changes the behavior of existing SMTP commands,
   it is first necessary for the sender-SMTP to enable its use.  To do
   this, the sender-SMTP issues the MREP command, with no arguments.  If
   the receiver returns a positive completion reply (which it must do
   with a 250 reply code), then for the rest of the session the MREP
   extension is enabled and the behavior of the receiver-SMTP is
   modified as described later in this document.  The MREP extension is
   never again disabled in the session, not by RSET or any other
   command.

   The MREP command may be issued at any time the sender-SMTP is
   permitted to issue the MAIL command.

5.  Effect on the DATA command

   When the MREP extension is enabled, there is one additional
   restriction placed on the DATA command, and one change to how replies
   to the final "." are sent.

   The additional restriction is that when there have been no successful
   RCPT commands in the mail transaction, the DATA command MUST fail
   with a 503 reply code.

   The change is that after the final ".", the receiver-SMTP returns one
   reply for each previously successful RCPT command in the mail
   transaction, in the order that the RCPT commands were issued.  Even
   if there were multiple successful RCPT commands giving the same
   forward-path, there must be one reply for each successful RCPT
   command.

   When one of these replies to the final "." is a Positive Completion
   reply, the receiver-SMTP is accepting responsibility for delivering
   or relying the message to the corresponding recipient.  It must take
   this responsibility seriously, i.e., it MUST NOT lose the message for
   frivolous reasons, e.g., because the host later crashes or because of
   a predictable resource shortage.

   A multiline reply is still considered a single reply and corresponds
   to a single RCPT command.


   EXAMPLE:

      R: 220 foo.edu SMTP server ready
      S: EHLO foo.edu
      R: 250-foo.edu

      R: 250 SIZE
      S: MREP
      R: 250 MREP extension now enabled
      S: MAIL FROM:<chris@bar.com>
      R: 250 OK
      S: RCPT TO:<pat@foo.edu>
      R: 250 OK
      S: RCPT TO:<jones@foo.edu>
      R: 550 No such user here
      S: RCPT TO:<green@foo.edu>
      R: 250 OK
      S: DATA
      R: 354 Start mail input; end with <CRLF>.<CRLF>
      S: Blah blah blah...
      S: ...etc. etc. etc.
      S: .
      R: 250 OK
      R: 452 <green@foo.edu> is temporarily over quota
      S: QUIT
      R: 221 foo.edu closing connection

   NOTE: in the above example, the domain names of both the sender-SMTP
   and receiver-SMTP are identical.  This is because in the example the
   sender-SMTP and receiver-SMTP are different subsystems of the same
   mail domain.

6.  Effect on the BDAT command

   When the MREP extension is enabled and the receiver-SMTP supports the
   ESMTP CHUNKING extension [BINARYMIME], a BDAT command containing the
   LAST parameter returns one reply for each previously successful RCPT
   command in the mail transaction, in the order that the RCPT commands
   were issued.  Even if there were multiple successful RCPT commands
   giving the same forward-path, there must be one reply for each
   successful RCPT command.  If there were no previously successful RCPT
   commands in the mail transaction, then the BDAT LAST command returns
   zero replies.

   When one of these replies to the BDAT LAST command is a Positive
   Completion reply, the receiver-SMTP is accepting responsibility for
   delivering or relying the message to the corresponding recipient.  It
   must take this responsibility seriously, i.e., it MUST NOT lose the
   message for frivolous reasons, e.g., because the host later crashes
   or because of a predictable resource shortage.

   A multiline reply is still considered a single reply and corresponds
   to a single RCPT command.

Internet DRAFT                    MREP                 December 19, 1995


   The behavior of BDAT commands without the LAST parameter is not
   changed; they still return exactly one reply.

7.  Implementation requirements

   Use of the MREP extension can aggravate the situation described in
   [DUP-MSGS].  To avoid this synchronization problem, the following
   requirements are made of implementations:

   A receiver-SMTP implementation which is capable of quickly accepting
   responsibility for delivering or relaying a message to multiple
   recipients and which is capable of sending any necessary notification
   messages SHOULD NOT accept the MREP command.

   The MREP extension SHOULD NOT be used over wide area networks.

   The receiver-SMTP SHOULD send each reply as soon as possible.  If it
   is going to spend a nontrivial amount of time handling delivery for
   the next recipient, it SHOULD flush any outgoing SMTP buffer, so the
   reply may be quickly received by the sender-SMTP.

   The sender-SMTP SHOULD process the replies as they come in, instead
   of waiting for all of the replies to arrive before processing any of
   them.  If the connection closes after replies for some, but not all,
   recipients have arrived, the sender-SMTP MUST process the replies
   that arrived and treat the rest as temporary failures.

8.  Fallback strategies

   If a receiver-SMTP which does not implement a mail queue receives a
   mail transaction when the MREP extension has not been enabled, it has
   one of two choices:

   1. Cause the MAIL command to fail with a 500 or some other Permanent
   Negative Completion reply.  This will hopefully cause the
   misconfiguration of the sender-SMTP to be obvious.

   2. Accept the MAIL command and at most one RCPT command.  After
   returning one success reply to an RCPT command, further RCPT commands
   in the mail transaction fail with a 450 or some other Transient
   Negative Completion reply.  This will permit delivery to one
   recipient per transaction.  Remaining recipients will be hopefully
   queued for delivery during subsequent delivery attempts.
