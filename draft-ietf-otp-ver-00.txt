1.0 ABSTRACT

  This document provides a series of inputs and correct outputs for all
  three of the defined OTP cryptographic hashes presented in RFC 1938.
  Specifically MD4, MD5, and SHA1.  This document is intended to be used
  by developers for interoperability checks when creating generators or
  servers.  Output is provided in both hexadecimal notation and the six
  word encoding documented in Appendix C of RFC 1938.

5.0 Security Considerations

The whole concept of OTP's are part of a security system, however this
document does not deal with any security issues.
