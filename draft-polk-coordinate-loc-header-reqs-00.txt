1.0 Introduction

This document calls for an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol 
for a Coordinate Location Header principally to be used in times of 
emergency.

1.1  Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
document are to be interpreted as described in [1].


1.2 Motivation

When a SIP UA initiates a session to a well-known emergency response URI, 
such as "sos@any_erc.domain" from [2], providing the emergency response 
center with the UA's Coordinate location could be beneficial, especially 
if the caller is signaling for "help". 


1.3 Terminology

The following terms and acronyms will be used throughout this document:

   ERC = Emergency Response Center


2.0 Overview of the Coordinate Location

A Coordinate is a Latitude value, a Longitude value or an Altitude value. 
A Coordinate Location is these 3 values in a group. Resolution is the 
knowledge that a thing or device or person is within a defined boundary. 
The level of resolution is termed precision. How precise a coordinate 
location is depends on how much area (either 2 or 3 dimensionally) is 
provided between given boundaries. If none is given, this should be 
considered a coordinate intersection, or a point (either 2 or 3 
dimensionally). 



Polk                                                                Page 2

When the precision is between two Latitude lines, there must be derived a 
latitude pair (which the object is between). Couple this with the 
Longitude pair, and the result is a 2 dimensional location area. If the 
object is a person, a building or a handheld device for instance, and the 
latitude (and maybe the longitude) pair(s) is miles apart, the precision 
is minimal (or small or less). If the same object were described with a 
precision of latitude pairing of millimeters, the precision is great (or 
high). If there is no longitude pairings, the object has been given a 
maximum (or best) known resolution (or precision).

In the cases of UAs initiating session with emergency response centers, 
the best available known precision is desired.

In a voice application today, emergency response centers typically want 3 
things from in an emergency call:

      #1 - the call itself

      #2 - the call back number

      #3 - the location of the caller

SIP with [2] can provide the call and the return URI (either in the From 
or Contact fields). The location of the caller is difficult, and one 
solution for this is the caller tells the emergency response center where 
they are. Technically, the UA can transmit this location information in 
the original INVITE via the proposed extension here if the UA knows its 
location already. 

One mechanism for the UA learning its location is described in [3]. This 
DHCP Option provides all that is necessary for the emergency response 
center to know where the session initiator is. 

Although this Geopriv/DHC Option is based on a wired UA, this header is 
connectivity type unaware, and can be used if the location of a UA were 
learned through other means.


3.0 Coordinate Location Requirements

The following are the requirements for the creation of this Header-field

   REQ# 1 - The Coordinate Header consist of Latitude, Longitude and 
            Altitude

   REQ# 2 - The resolution of the coordinates be the most precise known to 
            the UA

   REQ# 3 - An optional field, one each for Latitude and Longitude 
            coordinates, is supplied for each coordinate to give the known 
            boundaries

For example, if the UA knows it is between two latitude lines (the 
equivalent of two latitude numbers), this be included in the Coordinate

Header in such a way as both appear as a pair for Latitude and/or 
Longitude.

   REQ# 4 - To ensure numbers or decimals aren't rounded off, all digits 
            should be included that are know in each Coordinate field 
            (Lat/Long/Alt)

   REQ# 5 - No digits should be rounded up or down, making the coordinate 
            location less precise

   REQ# 6 - A Datum Field must be present to ensure the local significance 
            of the Coordinate Location given

   REQ# 7 - When the Coordinate header is to be included in a SIP message, 
            even during emergency conditions, it should be considered a 
            "Using Protocol" as defined within [4], and follow the 
            policies and security considerations as outlined within that 
            document


4.0 Security Considerations

Just as stated in the last requirement above, when a SIP message includes 
the Coordinate Header, SIP (or the UA) should incorporate the guidelines 
set forth in [4] to ensure the correct policies and security information 
is fully utilized - based upon the reason why the header is included in 
that message.


5.0 IANA Considerations

There are no IANA considerations within this document
