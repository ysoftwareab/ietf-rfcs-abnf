Abstract

   This document proposes a protocol for remote control of a phone.  The
   extensions proposed are designed to be simple both to understand and
   to implement.


1 Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.


2 Definitions

   Master: A device which issues PhoneControl requests.  For example, a
     personal digital assistant (PDA) or a Personal Computer (PC).

   Phone: A device which receives control requests and sends responses.
     For example, a SIP phone or back-to-back UA.

Internet Draft               phonectl                   January 10, 2001

   Line: One end of a SIP call leg.  Analogous to a line of a multi-line
     POTS phone. The line connects the phone to another remote SIP
     endpoint (not to the master).

   Active: A phone line in a non-idle state.  For example: ringing,
     connected, or indicating failure (fast busy).

   Back-to-back UA: A device which can connect multiple calls like a
     user agent would. These calls can then have their media selectively
     bridged.


3 Introduction

   This document proposes a protocol for remote control of a phone.  The
   syntax is optimized for a SIP endpoint, and a method of transporting
   commands over SIP is defined, but non-IP devices can also use it.


4 Message Transport

   When using a transport layer of SIP, PhoneControl messages shall use
   the method PHONECTL, but be contained entirely in the body.  SIP
   provides transport, reliability, sequencing, authentication, and
   addressing.

   Phonectl message shall have the MIME type text/phonecontrol.


5 PhoneControl Syntax

   A PhoneControl message consists of a list of RFC822-style headers. 
   Use of line folding is discouraged.

   Each PhoneControl message begins with a version string.

        PhoneControl-message = Version-Header *message-header

        Version-Header       = "PhoneControl" ":" PC-Version CRLF
        PC-Version           = "1.0"


   There are two types of messages, requests and responses.  A response
   is identified by containing a Response header, indicating the result
   of the action.  Only phones send responses.  Only masters send
   requests.


6 Command Header

   The Command header is a mandatory header for every PHONECTL message. 

Dean/Belkind/Biggs                                              [Page 2]

Internet Draft               phonectl                   January 10, 2001

   The command is followed by a case-insensitive string indicating the
   action to be taken.  The command header MUST be copied into the
   response.

        Command-Header    = "Command" ":" Command-Value
        Command-Value     = "dial" | "hangup" | "digits" | "select" |
                            "lines" | "query" | "login" | "get" |
                            "set" | "capability" | "users" |
                            extension-command
        extension-command = token


7 Response Header

   The response header indicates the result of a PhoneControl request. 
   It contains a numeric result code and a response string.

        Response-Header      = "Response" ":"
                                Response-Code SP Response-Value
        Response-Code        = 3DIGIT
        Response-Value       = *<TEXT-UTF8>


8 Device Header

   This header is used with select and capability commands.  Device
   names are discovered using the capability command.  With the "select"
   command a phone call can be attached to a device.  For example, the
   following message moves a call to speakerphone:

          PhoneControl: 1.0
          Command: select
          Line: line3
          Device: speakerphone

   The device header is optional in a select command.  When missing a
   non-hold device will be used.

   A device may contain the modifier "mute", which disables the local
   microphone.

   The devices which prefix with the string mixer tend to be useful for
   back-to-back UA's.


9 Line Header

   The phone presents itself as a multi-line phone.  Only the phone
   chooses the line names.  The line names MAY contain spaces.  The
   phone SHOULD name the lines with something presentable to the user. 
   The phone may choose to frequently reuse line names, or not.  For

Dean/Belkind/Biggs                                              [Page 3]

Internet Draft               phonectl                   January 10, 2001

   example:

          Line: green
          Line: 1
          Line: 847-555-1415
          Line: rick@siphappens.com

   If the phone uses a SIP URI for the line, it is preferable that the
   URI is the near-end name of the line.

   When a PhoneControl command is sent down an established call-leg (one
   that has had an INVITE), the nickname of "myself" can be used for the
   line representing call-leg.


10 User Header

   This header is used by the login command.  It is used to identify a
   user.


11 Access Header

   This header is used with the capabilities and login command to
   indicate the access authentication schemes supported by the phone.

12 Authorization Header

   This header gives credentials to be used by the phone for future
   requests (not to the master).

   The format of clear uses digest style parameters.  The password is
   hex encoded.  Before the password is hex encoded it is XOR'ed with
   the MD5 Hash of all passwords used to authenticate the PhoneControl
   request.  The MD5 hash is not hex encoded before XORing.  If the
   password is too long, the hash is repeated.  Before XORing the
   password may be appended with zeros which are discarded upon
   unencoding.

    Authorization: clear
     realm="3com.com",user="Rick",password="17a82cd62e19"


13 Command Header

   This header is used with the capabilities and login command to
   indicate the commands supported by the phone.

14 Dial Command

   The dial command is used to place a call to the address listed in the
   To header.  It is recommended that the command also contain a From
   header to indicate who initiated the call.

   For example, to initiate a call the master might send a message that
   looks like:

        PhoneControl: 1.0
        Command: dial
        To: "Salesdroid" <sip:sales@3com.com>
        From: sip: belkind@3com.com

   The phone responds to the command with a 200 OK it if accepts the
   request.  This does not imply that the INVITE was successful.  If
   accepted, the response MUST contain a Line header indicating to the
   master on which line the call was made.  This identifier can then be
   used to track the progress of the call.  In general, phones must
   never need to wait on network traffic before responding to a PHONECTL
   command.

   Any "to" or "from" header which does not contain a scheme (e.g. 
   sip:) will be mapped to a SIP URI just like the user entered it on
   the phone interface.  e.g.  appending a default dialing domain.

   The dial command may contain Authorization headers to be used on only
   this call.  See the Login Command for more details.


15 Hangup Command

   The hangup command will cause the phone to terminate a call.  If the
   call is not yet connected, the master MAY include a Status header
   indicating the status code to return for the incoming INVITE.  If no
   line is given, then the currently selected lines are disconnected.

   If the master supplies a "To" or "From" header, these MUST match the
   call leg or the hangup command is rejected.  Matching is not strict.

   A hangup command could look like:

        PhoneControl: 1.0
        Command: hangup
        Line: Line 2

   Hangup command for a locally ringing call:

        PhoneControl: 1.0
        Command: hangup
        Status: 600 Declined

Dean/Belkind/Biggs                                              [Page 5]

Internet Draft               phonectl                   January 10, 2001

        Line: Line 2

   hangup is not appropriate for 300-class responses, use 'redirect'
   command.


16 Digits Command

   The digits command is intended for DTMF generation in established
   calls, but may be used for incremental dialing or other key presses.

   DTMF digits are enclosed in double quotes.  Multiple digits MAY be
   sent in one request.  An additional token of Ok MAY be appended to
   indicate the end of dialing for those phones which support it.  A
   token of flashhook is also defined:

          Digits-Header = "Digits" ":" 1*( quoted-string | "ok" |
                          "cancel" | "back" | "flashhook" |
                          extension-button )


   An example digits request to dial a number might be:

          PhoneControl: 1.0
          Command: Digits
          Digits: "5551212" ok


   Entering DTMF tones during a call can be represented as:

          PhoneControl: 1.0
          Command: Digits
          Digits: "123"


17 Lines Command

   The "lines" command allows the master to determine the active lines
   of a phone.  Any non-idle state, such as ringing or call failure
   (fast busy), is considered to be active.  Only the phone chooses the
   line names.  Line names may look like URI's, or descriptions, but
   SHOULD be human presentable.  The line name is used to reference the
   line in other PhoneControl

   The body of the response will contain a sequence of headers beginning
   with a Line header, and followed by zero or more additional headers. 
   Each occurrence of a line header indicates a currently active line. 
   Successive non-line headers describe the state of the previously
   defined line.  Each active line SHOULD return at least the status,
   to, from, and device headers.

Internet Draft               phonectl                   January 10, 2001

   An example "lines" response message might look like:

        PhoneControl: 1.0
        Command: Lines
        Response: 200 OK
        Line: red button
        Status:200 connected
        To: "Guido Schuster" <5551212@sfour.com>
        From: Rick@3com.com
        Device: handset
        Line: green button
        Status:200 Ok
        To: "Ikhlaq Sidhu" <7005554141@sfour.com>
        From: Rick@3com.com
        Device: hold
        Line: blue button
        Status:401 Authentication Required
        To: Rick@3com.com
        From: "Billy Biggs" <911@sfour.com>
        Device: hold


   The status header codes are the same status codes defined in RFC2543

   Two new (virtual) status codes of are hereby defined...

        184 Waiting on DNS
        185 Contacting, no response


18 Users Command

   The master uses this command to determine the users currently logged
   into a phone.

   The body of the List Users response contains a sequence of headers
   beginning with a User header, and followed by zero or more additional
   headers.  Each occurrence of a User header indicates a currently
   active user.  Successive non user headers describe the state of the
   previously defined user.

   Each active user SHOULD return at least the status header.

   The status header codes are the same as the response code to the last
   register.  An example response would be:

        PhoneControl: 1.0
        Command: Users
        Response: 200 OK
        User: rick@3com.com
        Status: 200 OK

        User: ronnen@belkind.net
        Status: 401 Authorization Required


19 Capabilities Command

   This command is used to discover the features and devices available
   on the phone.

   Each phone is responsible for its own devices, and should use names
   which are human presentable.  The first device name MUST correspond
   to the hold device.

   An example Capability response could look like:

       PhoneControl: 1.0
       Command: capability
       Response: 200 Ok
       Devices: hold handset speaker speakerphone mute
       Access: basic digest chap
       Commands: select users login hangup join dial


20 Select Command

   The select command makes a line off hook.  Thus, it will answer a
   ringing call.

   The select command MAY contain zero or one device header.  (for
   example hold, handset, speaker, or speakerphone).  If device is
   omitted then a non-hold device will be used.  Any previously selected
   lines for that device are put on hold.

   To conference, multiple line headers are listed.  A line may have
   only one device, but a device may have multiple lines (e.g.  when
   conferencing).  Be aware that the phone may be able to have different
   lines selected to handset and speakerphone simultaneously.

   For example, to place the current speakerphone call "Line 1" on hold,
   and select "Line 2":

        PhoneControl: 1.0
        Command: select
        Line: Line 2
        Device: speakerphone

   For example, to conference line "1" and "2" on mutted handset:

        PhoneControl: 1.0
        Command: select
        Device: handset mute

        Line: 2
        Line: 1


21 Join Command

   The join command will effect the end of a transfer.  The master can
   either provide two lines (for the end of consultation and supervised
   transfer), or provide one line and a user header (for blind
   transfer).  In SIP this is usually accomplished a REFER or BYE-Also.


22 Query Command

   The query command is used to retrieve the _to_, and _from_ of a call-
   leg and additional stats.  The query command MUST include either a
   Line header indicating the line being queried or a User header.

   The body of the query response MUST include the near and far names of
   a call-leg which correspond to the To and From of a SIP message.  The
   phone may include additional information.

   For example...

        PhoneControl: 1.0
        Command: query
        Line: line1

        PhoneControl: 1.0
        Command: query
        Response: 200 OK
        Line: line1
        To: rick@siphappens.com
        From: ronnen@siphappens.com
        Contact: 1415@gw5.3com.com
        Route: proxy1, proxy2, gw5.3com.com
        Status: ok
        Device: handset

   A query can also specify a user...

        PhoneControl: 1.0
        Command: query
        User: +18475551415

        PhoneControl: 1.0
        Command: query
        Response: 200 OK
        User: +18475551415@3com.com
        To: rick@fdd.com
        From: ronnen@belkind.net

        Contact: gw5.3com.com

   Extra parameters may be included in the response.

   If a query or users command for a user contains a "Contact:" header
   it MUST be an unaltered copy from the last REGISTER received.


23 Get Command

   This command is used to get phone specific parameters.  The request
   body contains a list of parameters, one per RFC822 header of the
   body.  If none are provided, the phone SHOULD volunteer some.  The
   parameters names are not standardized and may change from device to
   device.

   The response to a get request will contain a list of headers
   (name:value) in the body of the message.  If the Get request included
   a parameter that is not supported by the phone, the parameter will
   not be listed in the response.

   For example:

        PhoneControl: 1.0
        Command: get
        Vol:
        DDD:
        Nonexistent:

   The corresponding response:

        PhoneControl: 1.0
        Command: get
        Response: 200 OK
        Vol: 5
        DDD: 3com.com


   Suggested parameters are:

24 Set Command

   This command is used to set a phone specific parameter.  The body
   contains a list of headers (name:value).  Any parameter not supported
   is omitted in the body of the response.  The response will contain
   the modified value of the parameters.

   For example:

        PhoneControl: 1.0
        Command: set
        Vol: 9999
        DDD: 3com.com
        Nonexistent: foo

   The corresponding response:

        PhoneControl: 1.0
        Command: set
        Response: 200 OK
        Vol: 100
        DDD: 3com.com


25 Login Command

   The Login command allows the master to login and provide a phone with
   credentials so the phone has authority to place calls and register
   (i.e.  receive calls).

   "Login" does not give the master authority to PhoneControl the phone.
   A phone can regulate PHONECTL access with a 401 Unauthorized response
   to a PHONECTL request carried via SIP.  When this happens the master
   will reattempt the PHONECTL with an authorization header in the SIP
   head.

   The master can set a login duration with an expire header.  The
   master MUST use the expire syntax of seconds from present, but the
   phone MAY not.  An expire of "0" is a logout command.  The special
   expire value of "never" means the login should not expire.

   Each login command causes the phone to issue a REGISTER request for
   authentication.  Credentials provided with a expired login MAY be

Internet Draft               phonectl                   January 10, 2001

   kept until applicable connected calls complete.

   The login command will be successful (200 OK) even before a REGISTER
   is sent.  Masters wishing to track the progress of this resulting
   REGISTER message should subscribe or poll with the "users" command. 
   In general, phones must never need to wait on network traffic before
   responding to a PHONECTL command.

   Credentials will be sent as Authorization headers.  A master MAY
   choose to provide additional credentials beyond those necessary to
   login, and the phone will save them for use on future requests such
   as placing calls.

   For example...

          PHONECTL aphone.3com.com SIP/2.0

   Revealing passwords is a security concern.  It is not necessary for
   some modes of operation, but is useful as an alternative to human
   keying.

   The login command may contain extra get/set parameters.  If possible
   the phone will use these on a per user basis.


26 SIP SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY

   This draft defines a new NOTIFY event of "PhoneControl".  A
   subscriber will receive PHONECTL responses corresponding to timely
   requests for "lines" and "users".

28 Security Considerations

   Although passing passwords in plaintext is terrible security, there
   are many applications where users already memorize and enter a
   personal identification number (PIN).  This is already plaintext
   sharing of passwords.  Changing these PINs frequently, making them
   long and different for each service is good practice but presents a
   significant memorization problem.  Storing these passwords on a
   personal digital assistant (PDA), which delivers them electronically,
   can improve this.

   It is assumed that most use of the PHONECTL method will be for
   physically local devices, as an alternative to human keying.  Much of
   the communication will be over direct device-to-device channels such
   as infrared.  Use of plaintext password over shared medium like
   Ethernet is discouraged.

   Phones MAY require different PHONECTL passwords based on the command
   or line requested, and MAY report incomplete information as security
   dictates.

   Previous versions of PHONECTL tried to allow authenticated use
   without revealing passwords to the phone.  The phone would hold
   requests which needed digest authentication, and the master would
   assist.  This has not worked well in practice.  A better solution is
   one-time and time-sensitive passwords.  A PDA with PHONECTL makes
   this easier.
