Internet-Draft        CableHome Gateway QoS MIB          January 2003 
 
Abstract 
    
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  
   In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-
   based management for prioritized Quality of Service functionality 
   within a LAN, between a CableHome residential gateway device and 
   CableHome compliant LAN host devices. 
 
   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the 
   SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7].  The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP 
   framework and existing SNMP standards.

1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [12]. 
 
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [7], STD 58, RFC 2579 [8] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [9]. 
    
    
2. Glossary 
    
   The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable 
   system usage, from normal residential gateway operation, or from the 
   documents associated with the CableHome Specifications [21] & [22]. 
    
2.1 CATV 
    
   Originally "Community Antenna Television", now used to refer to any 
   cable or hybrid fiber and cable system used to deliver video signals 
   to a community. 
       
2.2 CableHome Residential Gateway 
    
   A CableHome Residential gateway passes data traffic between the cable 
   operator's broadband data network (the Wide Area Network, WAN) and 
   the Local Area Network (LAN) in the cable data service subscriber's 
   residence or business. In addition to passing traffic between the WAN 
   and LAN, the CableHome Residential Gateway provides several services 
   including a DHCP client and a DHCP server (RFC2131) [23], a TFTP 
   server (RFC1350) [24], management services as enabled by 
   SNMPv1/v2c/v3 agent compliant with the RFCs listed in Section 1, and 
   security services including stateful packet inspection firewall 
   functionality and software code image verification using techniques. 
    
2.3 Portal Services 
    
   A logical element aggregating the set of CableHome-specified 
   functionality in a CableHome compliant cable gateway device. 
    
2.4 Boundary Point (BP) 
   A logical element aggregating the set of CableHome-specified 
   functionality in a CableHome compliant LAN host device (LAN IP 
   Device).

Internet-Draft        CableHome Gateway QoS MIB          January 2003 
 
2.5 Application Identifiers 
   The port number assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority 
   (IANA) to an application, used by CableHome-specified elements to 
   identify an application. 
    
    
    
3. Overview 
    
   This MIB entity supports basic traffic prioritization and queuing for 
   CableHome compliant devices. The MIB is derived from the CableHome 
   1.1 specification [22]. Support for traffic prioritization and 
   queuing is provided through four tables. These tables and their use 
   is summarized below and described in detail in the CableHome 1.1 
   specification [22]. 
    
   Applications running on CableHome compliant devices are identified 
   with their IANA-assigned UDP/TCP port number. Service providers have 
   the ability to configure the priority for any application by 
   associating a priority number with the port number in a table 
   implemented in the cable gateway device (Application Priority Master 
   Table). When CableHome compliant LAN host devices acquire a network 
   address lease, they communicate to the cable gateway device the list 
   of applications implemented on the LAN host. This information is 
   recorded in two other tables in the cable gateway device (BP 
   Application Priority Table and Destination Priority Table). Portal 
   Services functions refer to the Application Priority Master Table and 
   reply to the LAN host device(s) with the priority assigned to their 
   applications. 
    
   The cable gateway device maintains a queue for each LAN interface, 
   and each interface supports a particular number of priority levels. A 
   fourth table, the PS Interface Attributes Table, maintains this 
   information. 
    
    
3.1 Structure of the MIB 
    
   This MIB entity contains one group: 
    
   The cabhPriorityQosGroup group contains the mechanisms needed for 
   CableHome compliant cable gateway devices and LAN hosts to identify 
   and communicate applications needing prioritized queuing and media 
   access. The cabhPriortyQosGroup contains the following tables: 
    
   cabhPriorityQosMasterTable  
   Allows the service provider to provision the residential gateway with 
   a list of supported applications and a priority value for each. The 
   Portal Services refers to this table when acting as a proxy for the

   service provider, to provide application priorities to Boundary Point 
   elements. 
 
    
   cabhPriorityQosBpTable 
   Contains the list of application identifiers for each BP element in 
   the LAN. These values are acquired by the PS during the BP Discovery 
   process as described in [22]. 
    
   cabhPriorityQosBpDestTable 
   Contains a list of destination IP addresses for each BP, each of 
   which can be provisioned for a special priority for a specified 
   application. Applications are identified by their IANA-assigned port 
   number. 
    
   cabhPriorityQosPsIfAttribTable 
   Identifies the number of queues and the number of media access 
   priorities for each LAN interface. LAN interfaces are identified by 
   their ifIndex. 
    
    
3.2 Management Requirements 
    
   In addition to the explicit requirements in this specification, the 
   Cable Gateway MUST support all applicable CableHome and IETF 
   requirements and MIB objects.

5. Formal Syntax 
    
   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur 
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [3]. 
    
6. Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations. 
    
   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and 
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
   them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide 
   features for such a secure environment. 
    
 
 
Bhagwat/Cardona/Luehrs   Expires - July 2003                [Page 14] 
Internet-Draft        CableHome Gateway QoS MIB          January 2003 
 
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.  
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects 
   in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as 
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
