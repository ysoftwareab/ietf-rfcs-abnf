1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR), defined in [RFC8402], leverages the source
   routing paradigm.  The headend node steers a packet through an SR
   Policy [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy], instantiated as an
   ordered list of segments.  A segment, referred to by its Segment
   Identifier (SID), can have a semantic local to an SR node or global
   within an SR domain.  SR supports per-flow explicit routing while
   maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress nodes to the SR
   domain.

   However, there is no standard method defined to compare and contrast
   the foundational SR packet forwarding capabilities of network
   devices.  This document aims to extend the efforts of [RFC1242] and
   [RFC2544] to SR network.

   The SR architecture can be instantiated on two data-plane: SR over
   MPLS (SR-MPLS) and SR over IPv6 (SRv6).  This document is limited to
   SRv6.

   SR can be applied to the IPv6 architecture with a new type of routing
   header called the SR Header (SRH) [RFC8754].  An instruction is
   associated with a segment and encoded as an IPv6 address.  An SRv6
   segment is also called an SRv6 SID.  An SR Policy is instantiated as
   an ordered list of SRv6 SIDs in the routing header.  The active
   segment is indicated by the Destination Address (DA) of the packet.

   For Segment Routing, PUSH, NEXT, and CONTINUE are operations applied
   by the forwarding plane.

   PUSH consists of the insertion of a segment at the top of the segment
   list.  In SRv6, the top of the segment list is represented by the
   first segment in the SRH.

   NEXT consists of the inspection of the next segment.  The active
   segment is completed and the next segment becomes active.  In SRv6,
   NEXT is implemented as the copy of the next segment from the SRH to
   the destination address of the IPv6 header.

   CONTINUE happens when the active segment is not completed; hence, it
   remains active.  In SRv6, the CONTINUE operation is the plain IPv6
   forwarding action of a regular IPv6 packet according to its
   destination address.

   [RFC5180] provides benchmarking methodology recommendations that
   address IPv6-specific aspects, such as evaluating the forwarding
   performance of traffic containing extension headers.

   The purpose of this document is to describe a methodology specific to
   the benchmarking of Segment Routing.  The methodology described is a
   complement for [RFC5180].

2.  SRv6 Forwarding

   In IPv6, a Prefix-SID is allocated in the form of an IPv6 address.
   For the IPv6 data plane, a new type of IPv6 Routing Extension Header,
   called Segment Routing Header (SRH) has been defined.  The SRH
   contains the Segment List as an ordered list of IPv6 addresses: each
   address in the list is a SID.  A dedicated field, referred to as

   Segments Left, is used to maintain the pointer to the active SID of
   the Segment List.

   There are three different categories of nodes that may be involved in
   segment routing networks.

   The SR source node is the headend node and steers a packet into an SR
   Policy.  It can be a host originating an IPv6 packet or an SR domain
   ingress router encapsulating a received packet into an outer IPv6
   packet and inserts the SRH in the outer IPv6 header.  It sets the
   first SID of the SR Policy as IPv6 Destination Address of the packet.

   The SR transit node forwards packets destined to a remote segment as
   a normal IPv6 packet on the basis of the IPv6 destination address,
   because the IPv6 destination address does not locally match with a
   segment.  Indeed, according to [RFC8200] the only node allowed to
   inspect the Routing Extension Header (and therefore the SRH) is the
   node corresponding to the destination address of the packet.

   The SR segment endpoint node receives packets whose IPv6 destination
   address is locally configured as a segment.  It creates Forwarding
   Information Base (FIB) entries for its local SIDs.  For each SR
   packet, it inspects the SRH and replaces the IPv6 destination address
   with the new active segment.

   The operations applied by the SRv6 packet processing are different at
   the SR source, Transit and SR segment endpoint nodes.

   The processing of the SR source node corresponds to the sequence of
   the insertion of the SRH, composed of SIDs stored in reverse order,
   and setting of the IPv6 Destination Address as first SID of the SR
   Policy.  It can be performed by encapsulating a packet into an outer
   IPv6 packet with an SRH.  Another possibility is to perform the
   insertion of an SRH as a new header between the IPv6 header and the
   Next Header (e.g. the Transport Layer Header, TCP or UDP).  This
   option only applies to IPv6 packets and it is especially suited in
   case the source host is acting as headend node.

   The processing of the SR segment endpoint node corresponds to the
   detection of the new active segment, which is the next segment in the
   Segment List and the related modification of the IPv6 destination
   address of the outer IPv6 header.  Then packets are forwarded on the
   basis of the IPv6 forwarding table.

   The processing of the SR transit node corresponds to normal
   forwarding of the packets containing the SR header.  In SRv6 the
   transit nodes do not need to be SRv6 aware, as every IPv6 router can
   act as an SRv6 transit node since any IPv6 node will maintain a plain

   IPv6 FIB entry for any prefix, no matter if the prefix represents a
   segment or not.

   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] specifies the concepts of SR
   Policy and steering into an SR Policy.  The header of a packet
   steered in an SR Policy is augmented with the ordered list of
   segments associated with that SR Policy.  SR Policy state is
   instantiated only on the headend node, that steers a flow into an SR
   Policy.  Indeed intermediate and endpoint nodes do not require any
   state to be maintained.  SR Policies can be instantiated on the
   headend dynamically and on demand basis.  Moreover, signaling can be
   used in the case of a controller based deployment.  For all these
   reasons, SR Policies scale better than traditional TE mechanisms.

   In addition to the basic SRv6 packet processing, the SRv6 Network
   Programming model [RFC8986] describes a set of functions that can be
   associated to segments and executed in a given SRv6 node.

   Examples of such functions are described in [RFC8986], but, in
   practice, any behavior and function can be associated to a local SID
   in a node, in order to apply any special processing on the packet.
   Obviously, the definition of a standardized set of segment routing
   functions facilitates the deployment of SR domains with interoperable
   equipment from multiple vendors.

   According to [RFC8986], 128 bit SID can be logically split into three
   fields and interpreted as LOCATOR:FUNCTION:ARGS (in short
   LOC:FUNCT:ARG) where LOC includes the L most significant bits, FUNCT
   the following F bits and ARG the remaining A bits, where 128=L+F+A.
   The LOC corresponds to an IPv6 prefix (for example with a length of
   48, 56 or 64 bits) that can be distributed by the routing protocols
   and provides the reachability of a node that hosts a number of
   functions.  All the different functions residing in a node have a
   different FUNCT code, so that their SIDs will be different.  The ARG
   bits are used to provide information (arguments) to a function.  From
   the routing point of view, the solution is scalable, as a single
   prefix is distributed for a node, which implements a potentially
   large number of functions and related arguments.

3.  Test Methodology

3.1.  Test Setup

   The Device Under Test (DUT) is connected to the test ports on the
   test tool according to [RFC2544].

   The test topology recommended for the SRv6 performance evaluation are
   the same as IPv6 and are described in [RFC5180] and [RFC2544], in



Fioccola, et al.        Expires September 8, 2022               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 BM for SRv6                    March 2022


   both single-port and multi-port scenarios.  Single-port testing
   measures per-interface forwarding performance, while multi-port
   testing measures the scalability of forwarding performance across the
   entire platform.

3.2.  IGP and BGP Support

   It is RECOMMENDED that all of the ports on the DUT and test tool
   support a Segment Routing extensions for dynamic Interior Gateway
   Protocol (IGP) for routing such as IS-IS
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-srv6-extensions] and OSPF
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-ospfv3-srv6-extensions] as well as Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) [I-D.ietf-bess-srv6-services].

   As specified in [RFC8402], in the context of an IGP-based distributed
   control plane, two topological segments are defined: the IGP-
   Adjacency segment and the IGP-Prefix segment; while, in the context
   of a BGP-based distributed control plane, two topological segments
   are defined: the BGP peering segment and the BGP-Prefix segment.

   The distribution method that is used (e.g.  OSPF, IS-IS, BGP) MUST be
   reported.

3.3.  Frame Formats and Sizes

   The tests for SRv6 will use the Frame characteristics as described in
   [RFC5180].

   As specified in [RFC5180], for Ethernet, the following frame sizes
   SHOULD be used for benchmarking over this media type: 64, 128, 256,
   512, 1024, 1280, and 1518 bytes.  Note that the recommended 1518-byte
   frame size represents the maximum size of an untagged Ethernet frame.
   A frame size commonly used in operational environments is 1522 bytes,
   the max length for a VLAN-tagged frame.

3.4.  Protocol Addresses

   IANA reserved an IPv6 address block for use with IPv6 benchmark
   testing (see [RFC5180]).  IPv6 source and destination addresses for
   the test streams SHOULD belong to the IPv6 range assigned by IANA.

3.5.  Traffic with SRH

   The extension header chain recommended in [RFC5180] for testing is:
   Routing header (24-32 bytes), Destination options header (8 bytes),
   Fragment header (8 bytes).  This was considered a real-life
   extension-header chain but it does not fit well for SRv6.




Fioccola, et al.        Expires September 8, 2022               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                 BM for SRv6                    March 2022


   The length of the SRH is (n x 16 + 8) bytes, where n is the number of
   segments.  So, for most of the SRv6 application the recommendation of
   [RFC5180] is not enough.  In addition, it is worth mentioning that
   the length of SRv6 packets is increased in Topology Independent Loop-
   Free Alternate (TI-LFA) Fast Reroute (FRR), binding SID, and
   microloop avoidance scenarios.

   For SRv6, the extension header chain characteristics and length that
   are used MUST be reported and the DUT MUST traverse the chain of
   extension headers, so the impact on performance can be observed.

4.  Reporting Format

   There are new parameters that MUST be added to the parameters
   specified in [RFC5180] and [RFC2544]:

   o  SRv6 types of nodes.

   o  Number of Segments considered in the SRH.

   o  Extension header chain (including SRH) characteristics and length.

   o  Global SIDs or Local SID forwarding behavior.

   o  SR Headend or Endpoint Behaviors eventually associated with a SID,
      as specified in [RFC8986].

   For the sake of completeness, the following Figure 1 reports all the
   SR Headend or Endpoint Behaviors, as defined in [RFC8986].  But, in
   most cases, it may not be necessary to test all the services and it
   is possible to select a subset.

5.  SRv6 Forwarding Benchmarking Tests

   This document recommends the same benchmarking tests described in
   [RFC2544] and [RFC5180] while observing the DUT setup and the traffic
   setup considerations described above.  Indeed, the specificities of
   SRv6, for example the SRH processing, require additional benchmarking
   steps.

5.1.  Throughput

   This section contains the description of the tests that are related
   to the characterization of a DUT's SRv6 traffic forwarding
   throughput.

   The list of segments for SRv6 is represented as a list of IPv6
   addresses, included in the SRH.  There are three distinct types of
   nodes that are involved in segment routing networks.

5.1.1.  Throughput of a Source Node

   Objective: To obtain the DUT's Throughput during the packet
   processing of a Source Node.  It is when the Source SR node, which
   corresponds to the headend node, encapsulates a received packet into
   an outer IPv6 packet and inserts the SR Header (SRH) as a Routing
   Extension Header in the outer IPv6 header.  The Segment List in the
   SRH is composed of SIDs and the Source SR node sets the first SID of
   the SR Policy as IPv6 Destination Address of the packet.

   Procedure: Same as [RFC5180].

   Reporting Format: Same as [RFC5180] but adding the additional
   parameters specified in Section 4.

5.1.2.  Throughput of a Segment Endpoint Node

   Objective: To obtain the DUT's Throughput during the packet
   processing of a Segment Endpoint Node.  It is when the SR Segment
   Endpoint node receives packets whose IPv6 destination address is
   locally configured as a segment.  The SR Segment Endpoint node
   inspects the SR header: it detects the new active segment, i.e. the
   next segment in the Segment List, modifies the IPv6 destination
   address of the outer IPv6 header and forwards the packet on the basis
   of the IPv6 forwarding table.

   Procedure: Same as [RFC5180].

   Reporting Format: Same as [RFC5180] but adding the additional
   parameters specified in Section 4.

5.1.3.  Throughput of a Transit Node

   Objective: To obtain the DUT's Throughput during the packet
   processing of a Transit Node.  It is when a Transit node forwards the
   packet containing the SR header as a normal IPv6 packet because the
   IPv6 destination address does not locally match with a segment.

6.  SR Policy: protection performance

   [RFC6414] provides common terminology and metrics for benchmarking
   the performance of protection mechanisms.

   An SR Policy can be used for Traffic Engineering (TE), Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM), or Fast Reroute (FRR) reasons.
   Protection allows that, in the event the interface associated with
   the Adj-SID is down, the packet can still be forwarded via an
   alternate path.  The use of protection is clearly a policy-based
   decision that determines, for example, that the packet processing by
   the source node is done to forward a packet over a backup path
   calculated using TI-LFA.  There are 2 different protection mechanisms
   for SR-TE: Segment protection specified in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-protection-sr-te-paths] and Path protection
   introduced in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

7.  Security Considerations

   Benchmarking methodologies are limited to technology characterization
   in a laboratory environment, with dedicated address space and
   constraints.  Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT
   specifically for benchmarking purposes.  Any implications for network
   security arising from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and
   in production networks.  The benchmarking network topology is an
   independent test setup and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may
   forward the test traffic into a production network or misroute
   traffic to the test management network.

   There are no specific security considerations within the scope of
   this document.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
