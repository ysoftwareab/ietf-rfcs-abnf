1.  Introduction

   This document defines an RR type ("OX") to implement an architecture
   for the exchange of digital objects using identifiers stored within
   the DNS.  DNS.  Each OX RR contains an object type that might be
   opaque and private to the producer and the consumer of the data and
   either the data (if small enough to fit in the RR) or a pointer on
   how to retrieve the actual data.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The OX Resource Record

3.1.  Description

   The Type value for the OX RR is TBD.  The OX RR is class independent.
   No special processing is required within DNS servers or libraries.

   The RDATA of the resource record comprises of five fields: OX-
   ENTERPRISE, OX-TYPE, OX-MEDIA-TYPE, OX-LOCATION and OX-DATA.

3.1.1.  Enterprise and Type fields

   The OX-ENTERPRISE and OX-TYPE fields are combined to indicate the
   semantic type of the OX record being represented by the RR.  That
   semantic is private to the producer of data hosted on an
   authoritative DNS server and the application software using a DNS
   stub resolver to retrieve it.

   The OX-ENTERPRISE field uses values as specified in the IANA SMI
   Network Management Private Enterprise Codes Registry
   [IANA-ENTERPRISE].  An exception to that is that the reserved value
   of zero (0) is used to indicate that the the OX-ENTERPRISE is not
   set.

   Some commonly used values of OX-TYPE are registered in the IANA OX
   Type Registry Section 7.1, others are privately defined.  As those
   private types might be used in cross-organization systems, use of the
   OX-ENTERPRISE field is RECOMMENDED to disambiguate types.

3.1.2.  Location field

   The OX-LOCATION signals how the OX-DATA field should be interpreted
   using the values specified in the OX Location Type Registry
   Section 7.2.

   The value 0 is reserved.

   For the value 1 ("Local"), the OX-DATA contains the actual OX object.

   For the value 2 ("URI") the OX-DATA contains a UTF-8 encoded string
   representing the URI from which the OX object can be obtained.

   For the value 3 ("HDL") the OX-DATA contains a UTF-8 encoded string
   representing the handle from the Handle System [RFC3650]  from which
   the OX object can be obtained.

   Other values might be defined in the future, for example for NFS,
   LDAP, etc...

   DNS software implementing the OX RR type MUST NOT drop or otherwise
   refuse to handle the OX RRs containing an unknown or unsupported OX-
   LOCATION and MUST treat the OX-DATA portion of the RR as an abstract
   opaque field.

Internet-Draft             DNS Object Exchange             December 2017


3.1.3.  Media Type

   The OX-MEDIA-TYPE field contains the Internet media type [RFC6838]
   for the OX object represented by this record.

   If a non-Local object is retrieved over a protocol that supports
   inclusion of a media type value (e.g. an HTTP Content-Type header)
   then the client MUST use that value (if supplied) in preference to
   any value specified inside this resource record.  In such case, the
   OX-MEDIA-TYPE MAY be set to NULL, length 0.

3.1.4.  Data

   The OX-DATA field contains either the object's data, or some form of
   reference specifying from where the data can be obtained, per the OX-
   LOCATION field above.

   OX-ENTERPRISE: a 32-bit unsigned integer in network order.

   OX-TYPE: a 32-bit unsigned integer in network order.

   OX-LOCATION: an 8-bit unsigned integer.

   OX-MEDIA-TYPE: A <character-string> (see [RFC1035]).  The first octet
   of the <character-string> contains the number of characters to
   follow.

   OX-DATA: A variable length blob of binary data.  The length of the
   OX-DATA is not contained within the wire format of the RR and has to
   be computed from the RDLENGTH of the entire RR once other fields have
   been taken into account.

3.3.  OX RDATA Presentation Format

   The OX-ENTERPRISE field is presented as an unsigned 32-bit decimal
   integer with range 0 - 4,294,967,295.

   The OX-TYPE field is presented as an unsigned 32-bit decimal integer
   with range 0 - 4,294,967,295.

   The OX-LOCATION field is presented as an unsigned 8-bit decimal
   integer with range 0 - 255.

   The OX-MEDIA-TYPE field is presented as a single <character-string>.

   The OX-DATA is presented as Base64 encoded data [RFC4648] unless the
   OX-DATA is empty in which case it is presented as a single dash
   character ("-", ASCII 45).  White space is permitted within Base64
   data.

4.  Security Considerations

   The use of DNSSEC is encouraged to protect the integrity of the data
   contained in the OX RR type.

5.  Privacy Considerations

   Personally identifiable information (PII) data appearing in the OX-
   DATA field SHOULD be encrypted.

6.  Operational consideration

   Some OX records might contain large data that is only of interest to
   a single party, as such, caching those records does not provide much
   benefits and could be considered a denial of service attack on the
   caching resolver infrastructure.  It is thus RECOMMENDED that the TTL
   associated with large OX RRs be set as small as possible to avoid
   caching.

7.  IANA Considerations
