Abstract

   The Control and maintenance protocol for providing various Layer 1
   and Layer 2 services over a Packet Switched Network has been
   described in [1]. This document pre-allocates the fixed Pseudo-wire
   identifier , and other fixed protocol values that are to be assigned
   by IANA using the "IETF Consensus" policy defined in RFC2434

1. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119


2. Pseudowire Type

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "Pseudowire Type".  These are 15-
   bit values.  PW Type values 1 through 63 are to be assigned by IANA
   using the "IETF Consensus" policy defined in RFC2434. PW Type values
   64 through 127 are to be assigned by IANA, using the "First Come
   First Served" policy defined in RFC2434. PW Type values 128 through
   32767 are vendor-specific, and values in this range are not to be
   assigned by IANA. A Pseudowire Type description of up to 65
   characters is required for any assignment from this registry.

   Initial Pseudowire type value allocations are specified below:

      PW type Description

      0x0001  Frame Relay DLCI
      0x0002  ATM AAL5 SDU VCC transport
      0x0003  ATM transparent cell transport
      0x0004  Ethernet Tagged Mode
      0x0005  Ethernet
      0x0006  HDLC
      0x0007  PPP
      0x0008  SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation Service Over MPLS (CEM) [Note1]
      0x0009  ATM n-to-one VCC cell transport

Internet Draft   draft-ietf-pwe3-iana-allocation-06.txt   September 2004


      0x000A  ATM n-to-one VPC cell transport
      0x000B  IP Layer2 Transport
      0x000C  ATM one-to-one VCC Cell Mode
      0x000D  ATM one-to-one VPC Cell Mode
      0x000E  ATM AAL5 PDU VCC transport
      0x000F  Frame-Relay Port mode
      0x0010  SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation over Packet (CEP)
      0x0011  Structure-agnostic E1 over Packet (SAToP)
      0x0012  Structure-agnostic T1 (DS1) over Packet (SAToP)
      0x0013  Structure-agnostic E3 over Packet (SAToP)
      0x0014  Structure-agnostic T3 (DS3) over Packet (SAToP)
      0x0015  CESoPSN basic mode
      0x0016  TDMoIP basic mode
      0x0017  CESoPSN TDM with CAS
      0x0018  TDMoIP TDM with CAS

   Note 1: This PW type is grandfathered for a historical protocol.  The
   recommended standards-track protocol to use is CEP (PW type 0x0010).


3. Interface Parameters field

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "Pseudowire Interface Parameter
   Identifiers". Parameter ID values 1 through 63 are to be assigned by
   IANA using the "IETF Consensus" policy defined in RFC2434. Parameter
   ID values 64 through 127 are to be assigned by IANA, using the "First
   Come First Served" policy defined in RFC2434. Parameter ID values 128
   through 255 are vendor- specific, and values in this range are not to
   be assigned by IANA. Any assigments requested from this registry
   require a description up to 54 characters. Furthermore a length
   specifed as follows:
     - A decimal integer
     - Text as follows:"up to X", where X is a decimal integer
     - Up to 3 different decimal integers.

       is also required for assignment from this registry.

       Initial Pseudowire Interface Parameter Identifier value
       allocations are specified below:
       Parameter ID Length    Description

          0x01        4       Interface MTU in octets
          0x02        4       Maximum Number of concatenated ATM cells
          0x03     up to 82   Optional Interface Description string
          0x04        4       CEP/TDM Payload Bytes
          0x05        4       CEP options
          0x06        4       Requested VLAN ID
          0x07        6       CEP/TDM bit-rate

Internet Draft   draft-ietf-pwe3-iana-allocation-06.txt   September 2004


          0x08        4       Frame-Relay DLCI Length
          0x09        4       Fragmentation indicator
          0x0A        4       FCS retension indicator
          0x0B      4/8/12    TDM options
          0x0C        4       VCCV parameter

   Note that the Length field is defined as the length of the interface
   parameter including the parameter id and length field itself.


4. Pseudo Wire Status"

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "Pseudowire Status Codes". These
   are bitstrings of length 32. Status bits 1-15 are to be assigned by
   IANA using the "IETF Consensus" policy defined in RFC2434. Initial
   bit allocations are specified in "IANA Allocations for pseudo Wire
   Edge to Edge Emulation (PWE3)" [IANA], and should be incorporated by
   IANA into the registry. PW Status Bits 16 through 23 are to be
   assigned by IANA, using the "First Come First Served" policy defined
   in RFC2434. PW Status Bits 24 through 31 are vendor-specific, and
   values in this range are not to be assigned by IANA.  Any requests
   for allocation from this registry must include a 65 character
   description.  Initial Pseudowire Status Codes value allocations are
   as follows:

      0x00000000 - Pseudo Wire forwarding ( clear all failures )
      0x00000001 - Pseudo Wire Not Forwarding
      0x00000002 - Local Attachement Circuit ( ingress ) Receive Fault
      0x00000004 - Local Attachement Circuit ( egress ) Transmit Fault
      0x00000008 - Local PSN-facing PW ( ingress ) Receive Fault
      0x00000010 - Local PSN-facing PW ( egress ) Transmit Fault


5. Security Considerations

   This document specifies only fixed identifiers, and not the protocols
   used to carry the encapsulated packets across the network.  Each such
   protocol may have its own set of security issues, but those issues
   are not affected by the identifiers specified herein.
