Abstract

   This document describes a framework for inter-domain Quality of
   Service (QoS).  It makes use of a new concept denoted by Meta-QoS-
   Class.  This new concept guides and simplifies QoS agreements between
   providers and opens up new perspectives for a global QoS-enabled
   Internet.

Internet-Draft         The Meta-QoS-Class concept              June 2005


1.  Introduction

   Inter-domain Quality of Service (QoS) is seen as one of the future
   challenges for the Internet community [RFC3869].  At a first stage,
   most of the effort has been put into intra-domain specific problems.
   A number of issues still appear to need further elaboration
   [RFC2990], before it is conceivable to have an operational deployment
   of QoS services including inter-domain aspects.

   As pointed in [WIP], concepts should always be created in relation to
   specific problems.  This memo focuses on inter-domain QoS and
   proposes some mechanisms to ease extending intra-domain QoS
   capabilities.  It introduces a new concept denoted by Meta-QoS-Class
   (MQC).  This concept is based on a very simple assumption: for two
   adjacent domains, each specifically engineered to convey traffic for
   a given application, the quality of the transportation across the two
   networks as a whole is likely to be satisfactory for the application,
   even if the two networks are managed by two different entities.
   Basically this is how the Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) works.
   Finally, this memo explains how MQC could be used to promote a global
   QoS-enabled Internet.  Note that this document doesn't specify any
   protocols or systems.

2.  Terminology

   Service Provider

      An entity that provides Internet connectivity.  Sometimes simply
      referred to as provider or SP.  This document assumes that a
      provider owns and administers an IP network called a domain.

   Domain

      A network infrastructure composed of one or several Autonomous
      Systems.

   Local-QoS-Class (l-QC)

      A QoS transfer capability across a single domain, characterized by
      a set of QoS performance parameters denoted by (D, J, L).  From a
      Diffserv [RFC2475] perspective, an l-QC is an occurrence of a Per
      Domain Behavior (PDB) [RFC3086].  It is then signalized by one or
      several Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)[RFC2474].

   (D, J, L)

      D: one-way transit delay [RFC2679], J: one-way transit delay
      variation or jitter [RFC3393], and L: packet loss rate [RFC2680].

   Inter-domain QoS

      Refers to the level of network QoS guarantees for communications
      that span several domains.

   Service scope

      Network boundaries demarcating the guarantees of a service.


3.  Assumptions

   This memo considers the Internet subset composed of all domains with
   Diffserv-like capabilities.  These capabilities can differ from one
   provider to another by the number of deployed l-QCs, by their
   respective QoS characteristics, and also by the way they have been
   implemented and engineered.  This memo does not put any specific
   requirements on the intra-domain traffic engineering policies and the
   way they are enforced.

   When crossing a domain, a traffic requesting a particular QoS
   treatment experiences conditions constrained by the values of the (D,
   J, L) tuple corresponding to the l-QC applied by the provider.

   A provider negotiates QoS agreements only with its BGP peers
   [RFC1771].  Potentially, all SPs that are directly accessible without
   the need to cross a third party domain (immediate neighbors).  This
   is referenced as the cascaded model, see (Figure 1).  The opposite
   approach is the centralized model, see (Figure 2), where agreements
   can be reached directly with any remote providers.

                  /-Agreement-\/-Agreement-\/-Agreement-\
                  |           ||           ||           |
               +--v-+       +-vv-+       +-vv-+       +-v--+
               |SP  +-------+SP  +-------+SP  |-------+SP  |
               |4   |       |3   |       |2   |       |1   |
               +--- +       +----+       +----+       +----+

                         Figure 1: Cascaded model

   There is a great deal of complexity and scalability issues related to
   the centralized approach, which represents a radical shift from
   current Internet business model.  Therefore, the only realistic way
   forward seems to be the cascaded approach.  This is the approach
   adopted in the remainder of this document.

4.  Binding l-QCs as a fundamental inter-domain QoS process

   Inter-domain QoS can be approached from many points of view.  For
   providers it is a matter of extending their service scopes, beyond
   the boundaries of their own domains.  They want to benefit from the
   Internet QoS infrastructure formed by all QoS-enabled domains.  On a
   low level (with regard to protocol layering) extending the service
   scopes means extending the l-QCs.  Packets leaving a domain that
   applied a given l-QC (signaled by a given DSCP if Diffserv is used),
   should experience similar treatment when crossing external domains up
   to their final destination.

   By definition, two l-QCs from two neighboring domains are bound
   together once the two providers have agreed to transfer traffic from
   one l-QC to the other.  Binding l-QC appears as a fundamental
   process, it should ensure the consistency of inter-domain QoS
   treatments.

   A provider needs to find the best match between its deployed l-QCs
   and the neighbor's l-QCs.  One potential difficulty is that providers
   are, in general, very reluctant to communicate on how their networks
   are engineered.  They consider this kind of information as private
   and confidential.  L-Qc binding should operate with minimal exchange
   of information.

5.  Provider to provider agreements analysis

5.1  About traps and glaciation

   In order to identify relevant criteria to bind adjacent l-QCs, this
   section analyzes provider to provider agreements based on chains of
   domains.

   Provider SPn offers IP connectivity services to its customers that
   are part of its BGP neighbors.  An IP connectivity service is a set
   of (Destination, D, J, L) where Destination is a group of IP

Internet-Draft         The Meta-QoS-Class concept              June 2005


   addresses reachable via SPn, and (D, J, L) is the QoS performance to
   get from SPn to Destination.  SPn guarantees the level of QoS for the
   crossing of the whole chain of providers (SPn, SPn-1, SPn-2, ...,
   SP1) from its own domain to the domain where Destination is located,
   see (Figure 3).  That means SPn implicitly guarantees the level of
   QoS for the crossing of distant domains like SPn-2.  In the same way,
   SPn-2 is likely to be part of numerous SP chains and to see its level
   of QoS guaranteed by many providers it has maybe even never heard of.

             -----> packet flow

                       <----------- Guarantee Scope ----------->

                 Figure 3: Provider to provider agreement

   Any modification in a given agreement is likely to have an impact on
   numerous external agreements that make use of it.  A provider sees
   the degree of freedom to renegotiate, or terminate, one of its own
   agreements, being restricted by the number of external (to its
   domain) agreements that depend on it.  This is referenced as the SP
   chain trap issue.  Within the scope of global Internet services, each
   provider would find itself being part of a large number of SP chains.
   This solution is not appropriate for a worldwide QoS coverage as it
   would lead to glaciation phenomena, ending up with a completely
   petrified QoS infrastructure, where nobody could renegotiate any
   agreement.

   If a QoS-enabled Internet is deemed desirable, with QoS services
   available potentially to and from any destination, as we are used to
   with the current Internet, any solution must resolve this problem and
   find alternate schemes for provider to provider agreements.

5.2  Recommendations for provider agreements

   These recommendations are based on two assumptions.  First, to avoid
   forming SP chain traps, provider to provider agreements should not
   cover several domains.  Second, since it is very hard to know about
   agreements more than one domain hop, and that these agreements can
   change, it is almost impossible to have an accurate visibility of
   their evolution.




Levis & Boucadair        Expires January 1, 2006                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         The Meta-QoS-Class concept              June 2005


   Therefore, a provider should take the decision to bind one of its
   l-QCs to one of its neighbor l-QCs based exclusively on:

   - What it knows about its own l-QCs;

   - What it knows about its neighbor l-QCs.

   Agreements are then based on guarantees covering a single domain.
   For any n, SPn should guarantee SPn+1 only the crossing performance
   of SPn.

5.3  Edge to edge guarantees

   It is very important to note that the proposition to limit guarantees
   to only one domain hop applies exclusively to provider to provider
   agreements.  It does not in any way preclude edge to edge guarantees
   for a user communication.

                 <-------------Edge to Edge------------->
                   +----+    +----+    +----+    +----+
                   |SP  +----+SP  +----+SP  |----+SP  |
         (User A)--|4   |    |3   |    |2   |    |1   |--(User B)
                   +----+    +----+    +----+    +----+
                 <--PtoP--><--PtoP--><--PtoP--><--PtoP-->

         <--  -->: guarantee scope

                  Figure 4: User communication guarantees

   Any QoS inter-domain solution, either based on MQC or on a completely
   different approach, is valid as long as each provider claiming to
   offer some QoS performance actually delivers the expected level of
   guarantee.  In Figure 4, edge to edge guarantee between users A et B
   is ensured by concatenation of local provider to provider (PtoP)
   agreements.

5.4  The need for MQC

   For its binding process, a provider will not use any information
   related to what is happening more than one domain away.  It will try
   to find the best match between its l-QCs and its neighbor l-QCs.
   That is to say, it will bind its l-QC with the neighbor l-QC that has
   the closest performance.  However, at the scale of a communication,
   if there is systematically a slight difference between each upstream
   and downstream l-QC, there can be a significant difference between
   the first and the last l-QC.  There must be a means to ensure the
   consistency and the coherency of a QoS treatment when traversing a
   given path.

Internet-Draft         The Meta-QoS-Class concept              June 2005


   A solution is to have a classification tool that defines two l-QCs as
   being able to be bound together if, and only if, they are classified
   in the same category.  Each category is called a Meta-QoS-Class
   (MQC).  Two l-QCs can be bound together if, and only if, they belong
   to the same MQC.

6.  The Meta QoS Class concept

6.1  Definition

   An MQC can be loosely defined as a label associated with a set of
   applications that bear similar network QoS requirements.  It can be
   put on any l-QC suited to convey packets from this type of
   applications.  It is a means to certify that this l-QC is suitable
   for the traffic of this application.

6.2  Template

   The following attributes should be documented in any specification of
   an MQC.

   o  A list of services (e.g.  VoIP) the MQC is particularly suited
      for.

   o  Boundaries for each QoS performance attribute (D, J, L), whenever
      required.  Several levels can be specified depending on the size
      of the network provider (regional, national, etc.).

   o  Constraints on traffic (e.g. only TCP-friendly).

   o  Constraints on the ratio: network resources for the class to
      overall traffic using this class (e.g. less resource than peak
      traffic).


6.3  Binding process

   A provider goes through several steps to extend its internal l-QCs.
   First, it classifies its own l-QCs based on MQCs.  Second, it learns
   about available MQCs advertised by its neighbors.  To advertise an
   MQC, a provider must have at least one compliant l-QC and should be
   ready to reach agreements to let neighbor traffic benefits from it.
   Third, it contracts an agreement with its neighbor to send some
   traffic that will be handled accordingly to the agreed MQCs.  The
   latter stage is the binding process.

   Note that when a provider contracts an agreement with a neighbor, it
   may well not know to what downstream l-QCs its own l-QCs are going to

Internet-Draft         The Meta-QoS-Class concept              June 2005


   be bound.  It only knows that when it sends a packet requesting a
   given MQC treatment (for example, owing to an agreed DSCP marking)
   the packet will be handled in the downstream domain by an l-QC
   compliant with the treatment associated with this MQC.

6.4  Properties

   An MQC typically bears properties relevant to the crossing of one and
   only one domain.  However this notion can be extended, in a
   straightforward manner, to the crossing of several domains, as long
   as the set of consecutive domains is considered as a single virtual
   domain.

   MQC should not be confused with PDB concept defined in Diffserv
   architecture.  The two notions share the common characteristic of
   specifying some QoS performance values.  But the two concepts differ
   in their purposes.  The objective for the definition of a PDB is to
   help implementation of l-QCs within a single administrative network.
   The objective for an MQC is to help agreement negotiation between
   providers, and therefore the process of binding two adjacent l-QCs.

   The MQC concept is very flexible with regard to new unanticipated
   applications.  According to the end-to-end principle [E2E], a new
   unanticipated application should have little impact on existing
   l-QCs, because the l-QCs should have been designed and engineered, to
   the extent possible, to gracefully allow any new application to
   benefit from the existing QoS infrastructure.  However, this issue
   does not concern the MQCs as such, because an MQC is an abstract
   concept that has no physical existence.  It is only the problem of
   l-QCs design and engineering.  Therefore, a new unanticipated
   application could simply drive a new MQC and a new classification
   process for the l-QCs.

   A hierarchy of MQCs can be defined for a given type of service (e.g.
   VoIP with different qualities: VoIP for residential and VoIP for
   enterprise).  A given l-QC can be suitable for several MQCs (even
   outside the same hierarchy).  Several l-QCs in a given domain can be
   classified as belonging to the same MQC.

   MQC is a concept.  MQC does not prohibit the use of any particular
   mechanism or protocol at the data, control, or management plane.  For
   example, Diffserv, Intserv, traffic shaping, traffic engineering,
   admission control, and so forth, are completely legitimate.  MQC
   simply drives and federates the way QoS inter-domain relationships
   are built.

Internet-Draft         The Meta-QoS-Class concept              June 2005


6.5  Common understanding

   The need for standardization is strong as far as inter-domain QoS is
   concerned [RFC2990].  Each provider must have the same understanding
   of what a given MQC is about.  A global agreement on a set of MQC
   standards is needed.  The number of classes to be defined must remain
   very small to avoid an overwhelming complexity.  There must be also a
   means to certify that the l-QC classification made by a provider
   conforms to the MQC standards.  So the standardization effort should
   go along with some investigations on conformance testing
   requirements.

7.  New perspectives for a gobal QoS-enabled Internet

   The MQC concept opens up new perspectives for a QoS enabled Internet
   that keeps, as much as possible, the openness characteristics of the
   existing best-effort Internet.  This is certainly not the only domain
   of application to explore, but it is sufficiently important to
   deserve some special considerations.

   The resulting QoS Internet can be viewed as a set of parallel
   Internets or MQC planes.  Each plane consists of all the l-QCs bound
   accordingly to the same MQC.  When an l-QC maps to several MQCs, it
   potentially belongs to several planes.  Users can select the MQC
   plane that is the closest to their needs, as long as there is a path
   available for the destination.

   The best effort service can be considered as relevant to the so-
   called best-effort MQC.  It is of primary importance to maintain a
   best-effort route available when no QoS route is known.  Best-effort
   delivery must survive QoS and must remain the main Internet transport
   service.

   When a provider contracts with another provider based on the use of
   MQCs, it simply adds a logical link to the corresponding MQC plane,
   basically like what current traditional inter-domain agreement means
   for the existing Internet.  As soon as a new domain joins an MQC
   plane, it can reach all domains and networks within this plane.

   Figure 5 a) depicts the physical layout of a fraction of the
   Internet, comprising four domains with full-mesh connectivity.

             a) physical configuration      b) an MQC plane

                           Figure 5: MQC planes

   Figure 5 b) depicts how these four domains are involved in a given
   MQC plane.  SP1, SP2 and SP4 have at least one compliant l-QC (SP3
   maybe has or not) for this MQC.  A bi-directional agreement exists
   between SP1 and SP2, SP1 and SP4, SP2 and SP4.

   Route path selection within a selected MQC plane can be envisaged as
   the traditional routing system used by the Internet routers: do your
   best to find one path, which is as good as possible.  Thus, we can
   rely on a BGP-like protocol, for instance the proposal detailed in
   [q-BGP], for the inter-domain routing process.  The resilience
   feature of the IP routing system is preserved: if a QoS path breaks
   somewhere, the routing protocol will make it possible to dynamically
   compute another QoS path if available, in the proper MQC plane.

8.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

9.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a framework and not protocols or systems.
   Potential risks and attacks will directly depend on the
   implementation technology.  Solutions to implement this proposal must
   detail security issues in the relevant protocol documentation.

   Particular attention should be paid on giving access to MQC resources
   only to authorized traffic.  Unauthorized access can lead to denial
   of service when the network resources get overused.
