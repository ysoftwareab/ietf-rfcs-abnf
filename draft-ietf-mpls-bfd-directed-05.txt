     Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) Directed Return Path
                    draft-ietf-mpls-bfd-directed-05

Abstract

   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is expected to be able to
   monitor wide variety of encapsulations of paths between systems.
   When a BFD session monitors an explicitly routed unidirectional path
   there may be a need to direct egress BFD peer to use specific path
   for the reverse direction of the BFD session.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 5880 [RFC5880], RFC 5881 [RFC5881], and RFC 5883 [RFC5883]
   established the BFD protocol for IP networks and RFC 5884 [RFC5884]
   set rules of using BFD asynchronous mode over IP/MPLS LSPs.  These
   standards implicitly assume that the egress BFD peer will use the
   shortest path route regardless of route being used to send BFD
   control packets towards it.

   For the case where a LSP is explicitly routed it is likely that the
   shortest return path to the ingress BFD peer would not follow the
   same path as the LSP in the forward direction.  The fact that BFD
   control packets are not guaranteed to follow the same links and nodes
   in both forward and reverse directions is a significant factor in
   producing false positive defect notifications, i.e. false alarms, if
   used by the ingress BFD peer to deduce the state of the forward
   direction.

   This document defines the BFD Reverse Path TLV as an extension to LSP
   Ping [RFC4379] and proposes that it is to be used to instruct the
   egress BFD peer to use explicit path for its BFD control packets
   associated with a particular BFD session.  The TLV will be allocated

   from the TLV and sub-TLV registry defined by RFC 4379 [RFC4379].  As
   a special case, forward and reverse directions of the BFD session can
   form a bi-directional co-routed associated channel.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

1.1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Problem Statement

   When BFD is used to monitor unidirectional explicitly routed path,
   e.g.  MPLS-TE LSP, BFD control packets in forward direction would be
   in-band using the mechanism defined in [RFC5884] and [RFC5586].  But
   the reverse direction of the BFD session would follow the shortest
   path route and that might lead to the problem in detecting failures
   on a unidirectional explicit path as described below:

   o  a failure detection by ingress node on the reverse path cannot be
      interpreted as bi-directional failure unambiguously and thus
      trigger, for example, protection switchover of the forward
      direction without possibility of being a false positive.

   To address this scenario the egress BFD peer would be instructed to
   use a specific path for BFD control packets.

3.  Direct Reverse BFD Path

3.1.  Case of MPLS Data Plane

   LSP ping, defined in [RFC4379], uses BFD Discriminator TLV [RFC5884]
   to bootstrap a BFD session over an MPLS LSP.  This document defines a
   new TLV, BFD Reverse Path TLV, that MUST contain a single sub-TLV
   that can be used to carry information about the reverse path for the
   BFD session that is specified by value in BFD Discriminator TLV.

3.1.1.  BFD Reverse Path TLV

   The BFD Reverse Path TLV is an optional TLV within the LSP ping
   [RFC4379], [RFC6424].  However, if used, the BFD Discriminator TLV
   MUST be included in an Echo Request message as well.  If the BFD
   Discriminator TLV is not present when the BFD Reverse Path TLV is
   included, then it MUST be treated as malformed Echo Request, as
   described in [RFC4379].

Internet-Draft          BFD Directed Return Path           February 2017


   The BFD Reverse Path TLV carries information about the path onto
   which the egress BFD peer of the BFD session referenced by the BFD
   Discriminator TLV MUST transmit BFD control packets.  The format of
   the BFD Reverse Path TLV is as presented in Figure 1.

    |                                                             |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                      Figure 1: BFD Reverse Path TLV

   BFD Reverse Path TLV Type is 2 octets in length and has a value of
   TBD1 (to be assigned by IANA as requested in Section 5).

   Length field is 2 octets long and defines the length in octets of the
   Reverse Path field.

   Reverse Path field contains a sub-TLV.  Any Target FEC sub-TLV
   (already defined, or to be defined in the future) for TLV Types 1,
   16, and 21 of MPLS LSP Ping Parameters registry MAY be used in this
   field.  Exactly one sub-TLV MUST be included in the Reverse Path TLV.
   If more than one sub-TLV is present in the Reverse Path TLV, then, in
   order to avoid ambiguity of which of TLVs to use, the egress BFD peer
   MUST send Echo Reply with the received Reverse Path TLVs and set the
   Return Code to "Too Many TLVs Detected" Section 3.2.

   If the egress LSR cannot find the path specified in the Reverse Path
   TLV it MUST send Echo Reply with the received Reverse Path TLV and
   set the Return Code to "Failed to establish the BFD session.  The
   specified reverse path was not found" Section 3.2.  The egress BFD
   peer MAY establish the BFD session over IP network as defined in
   [RFC5884].

3.1.2.  Static and RSVP-TE sub-TLVs

   When an explicit path on an MPLS data plane is set either as Static
   or RSVP-TE LSP respective sub-TLVs defined in [RFC7110] MAY be used
   to identify the explicit reverse path for the BFD session.

3.2.  Return Codes

   This document defines the following Return Codes for MPLS LSP Echo
   Reply:

   o  "Too Many TLVs Detected", (TBD3).  When more than one Reverse Path
      TLV found in the received Echo Request by the egress BFD peer, an
      Echo Reply with the return code set to "Too Many TLVs Detected"
      MUST be sent to the ingress BFD peer Section 3.1.1.

   o  "Failed to establish the BFD session.  The specified reverse path
      was not found", (TBD4).  When a specified reverse path is not
      available at the egress BFD peer, an Echo Reply with the return
      code set to "Failed to establish the BFD session.  The specified
      reverse path was not found" MUST be sent back to the ingress BFD
      peer Section 3.1.1.

4.  Use Case Scenario

   In the network presented in Figure 2 node A monitors two tunnels to
   node H: A-B-C-D-G-H and A-B-E-F-G-H.  To bootstrap a BFD session to
   monitor the first tunnel, node A MUST include a BFD Discriminator TLV
   with Discriminator value (e.g. foobar-1) and MAY include a BFD
   Reverse Path TLV that references H-G-D-C-B-A tunnel.  To bootstrap a
   BFD session to monitor the second tunnel, node A MUST include a BFD
   Discriminator TLV with a different Discriminator value (e.g. foobar-
   2) [RFC7726] and MAY include a BFD Reverse Path TLV that references
   H-G-F-E-B-A tunnel.

           C---------D
           |         |
   A-------B         G-----H
           |         |
           E---------F

                Figure 2: Use Case for BFD Reverse Path TLV

   If an operator needs node H to monitor a path to node A, e.g.
   H-G-D-C-B-A tunnel, then by looking up list of known Reverse Paths it
   MAY find and use the existing BFD session.
