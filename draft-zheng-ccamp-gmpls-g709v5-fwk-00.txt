1. Introduction 

   ITU-T G.709v3, published in 2012, defined the interfaces to Optical 
   Transport Network (OTN), supporting a variety of Optical Data Unit 
   (ODU) containers up to 100 Gbps and flexible multiplexing hierarchy. 
   The OTN control plane framework was described in [RFC7062], 
   corresponding signaling and routing extensions were further 
   specified in [RFC7139] and [RFC7138] respectively. Furthermore, 
   there were additional updates made to G.709v4, resulting in 
   additional extensions which are described in [RFC7892] and [RFC7963]. 

   To meet the increasing demand for higher client bit rates, Edition 5 
   of G.709 [ITU-T G.709v5] has been released to provide beyond 100G 
   capabilities by introducing an ODUCn layer, which contains an 
   optical payload unit(OPUCn).  

   This document reviews relevant aspects of beyond 100 Gbps (B100G) 
   OTN technology and how it impacts current GMPLS control-plane 
   protocols. It highlights new considerations and proposes how to 
   update the mechanisms described in [RFC7062] to meet B100G control 
   plane requirements.   

1.1. Scope 

   For the purposes of the B100G control plane discussion, the OTN 
   should be considered as a combination of the current OTN ODUk/Cn and 
   the wavelength optical layer.  This document focuses on only the 
   control of the ODUk/ODUCn layer.  The optical layer control will be 
   addressed in a separate document.

3.1.2. Supporting clients signals with ODUCn 

   According to [ITU-T G.709v5], various client signals can be mapped 
   to be supported by ODUCn. Typical client signal includes Ethernet, 
   MPLS and IP. The signal hierarchies can be found in Figure 1.

                            OTUCn 

                 Figure 1: Mapping Client Signal to ODUCn 

   Packet streams (e.g., Ethernet, MPLS, IP) which are encapsulated 
   with the generic framing procedure is considered as the client and 
   can be carried by OTN client signals (known as ODUk, including 
   ODU0~4 and ODUflex). Then the OTN client signals will be further 
   mapped into ODUCn containers and multiplexed into OTUCn. It is worth 
   noting that the maximum bit rate for ODUk is 100G (ODU4), which is 
   the same rate of ODUC1. The mapping from ODU client signal to ODU 
   Containers is also required when ODU4 is multiplexed into ODUC1.  

   Examples of multiplexing can be found as follow:  

    

      -  ODU0/ ODU1/ ODU2/ ODU3/ ODU4 into ODUC1 multiplexing with 
   5Gbps TS granularity: ODU0/ ODU1/ ODU2/ ODU3/ ODU4 occupies 
   1/1/2/8/20 of the 20 TSs for ODUC1. It is worth noting that for ODU0 
   and ODU1, the 5G TS is only partially occupied.  

   The type of the transported payload, encoded as the payload type, is 
   set to 22 for ODUCn. 

3.2. MSI of ODUCn 

      When multiplexing an OTN client signal into ODUCn, [ITU-T G.709v5] 
   specifies the information that must be transported in-band to 
   correctly demultiplexing the signal.  MSI is used to specify the 
   identifier of each multiplexing section. The MSI information is 
   located in the mapping specific area of the PSI signal and is local 
   to each link. 

      The MSI information is organized as a set of entries, with n 
   entries for each OPUC TS.  The MSI has a fixed length of 40n bytes 
   and indicates the ODTU content of each tributary slot (TS) of an 
   OPUCn.   

   Two bytes are used for each tributary slot.  The information carried 
   by each entry is: 

      - TS availability bit 1 indicates if the tributary slot is 
   available or unavailable. 

 
 
Zheng et al            Expires September 2017                 [Page 6] 

 draft-zheng-ccamp-b100g-otn-fwk-00.txt                      March 2017 
    

      - The TS occupation bit 9 indicates if the tributary slot is 
   allocated or unallocated. 

       - The tributary port number in bits 2 to 8 and 10 to 16 indicates 
   the port number of the ODTUCn.ts that is being transported in this 
   TS; a flexible assignment of tributary port to tributary slots is 
   possible. ODTUC.ts tributary ports are numbered 1 to 10n. The value 
   is set to all-0s when the occupation bit has the value 0 (tributary 
   slot is unallocated). 

   Tributary Port Number (TPN) indicates the port number of the OTN 
   client signal transported by the ODUCn.  The TPN is the same for all 
   the TSs assigned to the transport of the same OTN client signal. 

3.3. OTUCn sub rates (OTUCn-M) 

   An OTUCn with a bit rate that is not an integer multiple of 100 
   Gbit/s can be described as an OTUCn-M. An OTUCn-M frame contains n 
   instances of OTUC overhead, ODUC overhead and OPUC overhead together 
   with M 5Gbit/s OPUCn TS.  

   When an OTUCn-M is used to carry an ODUCn (20n-M) TS are marked as 
   unavailable, in the OPUCn multiplex structure identifier (MSI), 
   since they cannot be used to carry a client signal. 

    

4. Connection Management of ODUCn 

   ODUk based connection management has been described in section 4 of 
   [RFC7062]. In this section the connection management of ODUCn is 
   described, which is independent but used together with ODUk based 
   connection management.  

   ODUCn based connection management is concerned with controlling the 
   connectivity of ODUCn paths. According to ITU-T G.872, the 
   intermediate nodes with ODUCn do not support the switching of ODUCn 
   time slot. Intermediate ODUCn points are only considered as a 
   forwarding node.  Once an ODUCn path is used to transport client 
   signal, the TS occupied will not change across the ODUCn network.

5. GMPLS Implications 

5.1. Implications for GMPLS Signaling 

   For OTNv3 network control, [RFC7139] defines RSVP-TE signaling 
   extensions, extending the base specifications [RFC3473] and 
   [RFC4328]. 

   As described in Section 3, [ITU-T G.709v5] introduced some new 
   features including the ODUCn, OTUCn for beyond 100G control.  The 
   mechanisms defined in [RFC7139] do not support such features, and 
   protocol extensions SHALL be necessary to allow them to be 
   controlled by a GMPLS control plane.  In summary, the following new 
   signaling aspects SHOULD be considered: 

   -  Support for specifying new signal types and related traffic 
   information: The traffic parameters should be extended in a 
   signaling message to support the new ODUCn; 

   -  Support the new TS granularity: the signaling protocol should be 
   able to identify the TS granularity (i.e., the new 5 Gbps TS 
   granularity) to be used for establishing a Hierarchical LSP that 
   will be used to carry service LSP(s) requiring a specific TS 
   granularity. 

   -  Support for LSP setup of new ODUCn containers with related 
   mapping and multiplexing capabilities: A new label format must be 
   defined to carry the exact TS's allocation information related to 
   the extended mapping and multiplexing hierarchy (for example, ODU4 
   into ODUCn multiplexing (with 5 Gbps TS granularity)), in order to 
   set up all the possible ODU connections. 

   - Support for TPN allocation and negotiation: TPN needs to be 
   configured as part of the MSI information (see more information in 
   Section 3.1.2.1).  A signaling mechanism must be identified to carry 
   TPN information if the control plane is used to configure MSI 
   information. 

   - Support for LSP setup of OTUCn sub rates (OTUCn-M) path: based on 
   previous extensions, there should be new signal mechanism to declare 
   the OTUCn-m information.  

5.2. Implications for GMPLS Routing 

   The path computation process needs to select a suitable route for an 
   ODUCn connection request.  Evaluation of the available bandwidth on 
   each candidate link is required for path computation. The routing 
 
 
Zheng et al            Expires September 2017                 [Page 8] 

 draft-zheng-ccamp-b100g-otn-fwk-00.txt                      March 2017 
    

   protocol SHOULD be extended to carry sufficient information to 
   represent ODU Traffic Engineering (TE) topology. 

   The Interface Switching Capability Descriptors defined in [RFC4203] 
   present a new constraint for LSP path computation.  [RFC4203] 
   defines the Switching Capability, related Maximum LSP Bandwidth, and 
   Switching Capability specific information. [RFC7138] updates the 
   ISCD to support ODU4, ODU2e and ODUflex. The new Switching 
   Capability specific information provided in [RFC7138] have to be 
   adapted to support new features contained in [ITU-T G.709v5].  The 
   following requirements should be considered: 

   -  Support for carrying the link multiplexing capability: As 
   discussed in Section 3.1.2, many different types of ODUk can be 
   multiplexed into the ODUCn.  For example, ODU4 may be multiplexed 
   into ODUC1.  An OTUCn link may support one or more types of ODUk 
   signals.  The routing protocol should be capable of carrying this 
   multiplexing capability. 

   - Support for additional Tributary Slot Granularity advertisement: 
   as new tributary slot granularity (5G TS) is introduced in [G.709 
   v5], there is a need to specify this parameter.  

   - Support for advertisement of OTUCn sub rates support information: 
   Given the same n value, there is possible different OTUCn sub rates. 
   Corresponding information should be defined in the routing mechanism
