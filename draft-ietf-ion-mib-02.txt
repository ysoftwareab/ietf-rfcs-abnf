Abstract

  The purpose of this memo is to define the Management Information Base
  (MIB) for supporting Classical IP and ARP over ATM as specified in
  Classical IP and ARP over ATM, refer to
  reference [3]. Support of an ATM interface by an IP layer
  will require implementation of objects from several Managed
  Information Bases (MIBs) as well as their enhancement in order
  to enable usage of ATM transports. It is the intent of this MIB to
  fully adhere to all prerequisite MIBs unless explicitly stated.
  Deviations will be documented in corresponding conformance statements.

1.  Introduction

  This document is a product of the Internetworking Over NBMA Working
  Group. Its purpose is to define a MIB module for extending the
  traditional MIBs supported by a TCP/IP implementation to support
  Classical IP and ARP over ATM.

  Many MIB related RFCs and Internet Drafts have been considered in the
  development of this document. The ones that are considered central to
  the extensions defined by this document are:

         o RFC 2011 -  SNMPv2 Management Information Base for the
                   Internet Protocol using SMIv2 [10]. The IP over ATM
                   (IPOA) MIB provides extensions to the IP Group for
                   handling IP over ATM flows. A basic understanding of
                   the IP Group is essential for understanding this
                   document.

Greene et al.        IP and ARP over ATM (IPOA) MIB        21 March 1997


         o RFC 1573 - Interfaces Group Evolution [2]. This document is
                   important since it provides several very useful
                   enhancements over the interface group defined in RFC
                   1213 that aid in handling ATM related interfaces.

         o RFC 1695 - Definitions of Managed Objects for ATM Management
                   [4].  Support of this MIB is required for
                   implementing the layers between AAL5 and ATM. The
                   contents of this MIB will not explicitly be address
                   here. RFC 1695 provides a basis for managing ATM
                   interface layering and management of:

                            - ATM Switched Virtual Connections (SVCs)
                            - ATM Permanent Virtual Connections (PVCs)


  The ATM Forum UNI ILMI MIB is specified by the ATM Forum in various
versions of the UNI specification. The ILMI MIBs being defined are not
supported via SNMP agents but via SNMP requests sent over an ATM network
to an ATM entity encapsulated in an AAL5 header.  Support of the ILMI
MIB(s) is considered out of the scope of this document.



2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

  The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of three
  major components.  They are:

  o the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1], - the mechanisms used for
    describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

  o the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [5], - the core set of managed
    objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

  o the protocol, RFC 1157 [9] and/or RFC 1905 [7] - the protocol
    for accessing managed information.

  Textual conventions are defined in RFC 1903 [6], and conformance
  statements are defined in RFC 1904 [8].

  The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
  experimentation and evaluation.

  This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI.
  A semantically identical MIB conforming to the SNMPv1 SMI can be
  produced through the appropriate translation.

2.1.  Object Definitions

  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
  the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
  defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
  defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named
  by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The
  object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
  identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
  convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to
  refer to the object type.



3.  Structure of the MIB

  The Classical ARP and IP over ATM (IPOA) MIB structure is split into
  three components:

    o Basic Support MIB Definitions
    o Client Supported MIB Definitions
    o ATMARP Server MIB Definitions

  All IP and ARP over ATM entities, both clients and ATMARP servers, are
  required to support the MIB definitions in the Basic Support MIB
  Definitions section. Clients need to additionally support the MIB
  definitions outlined in the Client specific section and ATMARP Servers
  must additionally support the ATMARP Server specific MIB definitions.

  Implementation of the Definitions of Managed Objects for ATM
  Management [4] defines the modeling of the various layers within an
  ATM Interface. This modeling is assumed as a prerequisite for the IPOA
  MIB. The IPOA MIB makes no assumptions on how this layering is
  actually implemented within a system. Several of the MIB tables
  defined by the IPOA MIB, like the base TCP/IP MIBs, requires that an
  ifIndex exist that points to an ATM Interface.  Refer to the
  Definitions of Managed Objects for ATM Management (RFC 1695) for the
  definition of an ATM Interface interface layering.

  The use of an IP over ATM Virtual Interface layer is not explicitly
  required by the IPOA MIB. The use of virtual layers above an RFC1695
  defined interface layer is not absolutely necessary for modeling the
  attachment of IP to an ATM network. The IPOA MIB uses a generic
  ifIndex that must related to a ATM Physical Interface in its MIB
  definitions.  It up to the implementers of this MIB to determine their
  own ATM interface layering (assuming compliance with RFC 1573 and RFC
  1695).  The IANA ifType propVirtual was created for this purpose and
  is used in RFC 1695.

3.1.  Basic Support MIB Definitions

  Basic support that must be implemented by both Clients and ATMARP
  Servers consist of:

    o ATM Logical IP Subnet (LIS) Table
    o ATM Logical IP IF Mapping Table
    o ATMARP Remote Server Table
    o ATM VC Table
    o ATM Config PVC Table
    o Notifications


3.1.1.  ATM Logical IP Subnet (LIS) Table

  The ATM Logical IP Subnet (LIS) Table defines the subnets that this
  system is a member of for purposes of reaching destinations over a ATM
  transport.  The LIS table is indexed by the subnet address
  (ipoaLisSubnetAddr) and not ifIndex.  The ipoaLisIfMappingTable
  described in the next section provides the mapping between Logical IP
  Subnets and the interface layer. It is possible that the same LIS can
  be reached via different ATM physical interfaces.

  The ipAddrTable and the ipoaClientTable provides the mapping from a
  local IP address to a ATM physical interface. One or more ipAddrTable
  entries can point to the same ipoaLisEntry. An ipAddrEntry's
  ipAdEntAddr ANDed with its ipAdEntNetMask should equal an
  ipoaLisEntry's ipoaLisSubnetAddr. Given that a interface can be
  multi-homed each local IP address associated with an interface
  requires an entry in the ipAddrTable. Each ipAddrTable entry for a
  local IP address associated with a ATM physical interface should map
  to an entry in the ipoaLisTable.

  The bulk of the objects in a ipoaLisEntry exists to control ATMARP for
  a particular LIS:

         ipoaLisInactivityTimer
         ipoaLisMinHoldingTime
         ipoaLisQDepth
         ipoaLisMaxCalls
         ipoaLisCacheEntryAge
         ipoaLisRetries
         ipoaLisTimeout

  An ipoaLisMaxCalls defines the maximum number of VCs that can be
  established simultaneously per LIS. An ipoaLisDefaultPeakCellRate
  defines the best effort default peak cell rate in both the forward and
  backwards direction when establishing a VCCs.

Greene et al.        IP and ARP over ATM (IPOA) MIB        21 March 1997


  The ipAddrTable's ipAdEntReasmMaxSize is the "The size of the largest
  IP datagram which this entity can re-assemble from incoming IP
  fragmented datagrams received on this interface" and is different from
  the ipoaLisTable's ipoaLisDefaultMtu with is the default MTU used
  within an LIS. Note that this is the default MTU used within the LIS
  represented by this entry. Note that this is the default MTU not the
  actual which is represented as ipoaVcNegotiatedMtu in the ipoaVcTable.

  The ipoaLisRowStatus object enables entries in the ipoaLisTable to be
  created or deleted via SNMP. Creation of an ipoaLisTable entry results
  in the adding of a corresponding ipAddrTable entry and a
  ipoaLisIfMappingTable entry. Creation of multiple ipAddrTable entries
  and ipoaLisIfMappingTable entries for the same LIS is not addressed by
  this document.  When ipoaLisRowStatus is changed from active(1) to
  notInService(2) or from active(1) to destroy(6), this has the side-
  effect of removing all entries from the ipNetToMediaTable that are
  associated with this LIS (in other words, it flushes the entity's
  ATMARP cache). It also removes the ipoaVcTable entries that were
  associated with those ipNetToMediaTable entries.  Destroying the row
  removes the corresponding entries in the ipoaArpSrvrTable,
  ipoaArpClientTable, ipoaLisIfMappingTable and the
  ipoaArpRemoteSrvrTable.

  Entries in both the ipNetToMediaTable and the ipoaVcTable that are
  associated with a ipoaConfigPvcEntry are not effected by changes to
  ipoaLisRowStatus.


3.1.2.  ATM Logical IP IF Mapping Table

  The ipoaLisIfMappingTable maps a LIS to all ATM physical interfaces
  that it is configured to be supported from. Each entry in the
  ipoaLisIfMappingTable should map to a ipAddrTable entry.  It is also
  possible for a system, most commonly a switch, to have multiple LISes
  associated with the same ATM physical interface.


3.1.3.  ATMARP Remote Server Table

  Entries in the ipoaArpRemoteSrvrTable exists to locally configure the
  remote ATMARP Servers that exist on a per LIS basis. Classic2 requires
  that at least one ATMARP server be configured per LIS where SVC
  traffic is intended. PVC usage doesn't require use of ATMARP. No
  ipoaArpRemoteSrvrTable entries should be configured for a LIS where
  only PVCs will be used. An entry in the ipoaArpRemoteSrvrTable is
  indexed by the subnet address of the LIS, ipoaLisSubnetAddr, and the
  ATM address of the remote ATMARP server, ipoaArpRemoteSrvrAddr.

Greene et al.        IP and ARP over ATM (IPOA) MIB        21 March 1997


  If a PVC is intended to be used to communicate with a remote ATMARP
  server then the ipoaConfigPvcTable should be used to create and active
  the PVC prior to activating a ipoaArpRemoteSrvrEntry. The
  ipNetToMediaTable and ipoaVcTable can be searched looking for a match
  on AtmAddr.  A value of 0 for both ipoaArpRemoteSrvrVpi and
  ipoaArpRemoteSrvrVci imply that no VC exists to the remote ATMARP
  server. ipoaArpRemoteSrvrRowStatus would also not be active.


3.1.4.  ATM VC Table

  A entry in the ipoaVcTable should have at least one corresponding
  ipNetToMediaTable entry.  Both tables use the ipNetToMediaTable's
  indexes ipNetToMediaIfIndex and ipNetToMediaNetAddress.  The
  ipoaVcTable has the additional indexes ipoaVcVpi and ipoaVcVci. A
  ipoaVcEntry exists for every VC per ATM physical interface per
  destination IP address.  Refer to the following diagram that
  illustrates the relationship between ipoaVcTable and the
  ipNetToMediaTable:

         ipoaVcTable                        ipNetToMediatable
       ------------------------------     ----------------------------
        ipNetToMediaIfIndex              ipNetToMediaIfIndex      
        ipNetToMediaNetAddress           ipNetToMediaNetAddress   
        ipoaVcVpi                                                 
        ipoaVcVci                                                 
        ipoaVcType                                                
                                         ipNetToMediaPhysAddress  
        ipoaVcNegotiatedEncapsType                                
        ipoaVcNegotiatedMtu                                       
                                         ipNetToMediaType         
       ------------------------------     ----------------------------

  ipoaVcType indicates if the entry is for a SVC or PVC. An ipoaVcEntry
  corresponding to a PVC is created automatically when a
  ipoaConfigPvcEntry is created and the IP Address at the end of the PVC
  disovered. The associating ipNetToMediaTable entry would have its
  ipNetToMediaType set to static(4). ipNetToMediaTable entries created
  during the ATMARP processing have a ipNetToMediaType of dynamic(3).
  The process to locally configuring a ipNetToMediaTable entry and a
  ipoaVcTable entry for a SVC without using ATMARP is not within the
  scope of this document.


3.1.5.  ATM Config PVC Table

  An entry in the ipoaVcTable is created after the InATMARP successfully
  completes for a ipoaConfigPvcEntry during its activation. InATMARP

Greene et al.        IP and ARP over ATM (IPOA) MIB        21 March 1997


  must return the IP Address of the other end of the PVC in order to
  have the needed indexes to create a ipNetToMediaEntry and a
  ipoaVcEntry. ipoaConfigPvcRowStatus would then be set to active(1).

  A Network Management Station wanting to create a PVC at a particular
  system for use as an IP transport would:


     o  use RFC1695 to create the PVC
     o  use the ipoaConfigPvcTable in the IPOA MIB to configure
        the PVC for use by IP

  Refer to the following diagram that illustrates the relationship
  between the ipoaVcTable and the ipoaConfigPvcTable:

         ipoaVcTable                        ipoaConfigPvcTable
       ------------------------------     ----------------------------
        ipNetToMediaIfIndex              ipNetToMediaIfIndex      
        ipNetToMediaNetAddress                                    
        ipoaVcVpi                        ipoaConfigPvcVpi         
        ipoaVcVci                        ipoaConfigPvcVci         
        ipoaVcType                                                
                                         ipoaConfigPvcDefaultMtu  
        ipoaVcNegotiatedEncapsType                                
        ipoaVcNegotiatedMtu                                       
                                         ipoaConfigPvcRowStatus   
       ------------------------------     ----------------------------

  When the ipoaVcEntry is created its ipoaVcType will be set to pvc(1),
  its ipoaVcNegotiatedEncapsType set to llcSnap(1), and its
  ipoaVcNegotiatedMtu set to 9180 octets by default. Classic2 allows use
  of other MTU values for PVCs but considers how a value other than 9180
  could be selected to be out of scope. ipoaConfigPvcDefaultMtu can be
  used to configure the MTU to be used for the PVC.  Both ends must have
  the same value configured.  The associating ipNetToMediaTable entry
  would have its ipNetToMediaType set to static(4).

  When ipoaConfigPvcRowStatus is changed from active(1) to
  notInService(2) or from active(1) to destroy(6), this has the side-
  effect of removing the corresponding ipNetToMediaEntry, ipoaVcEntry
  and ipoaConfigPvcEntry.


3.1.6.  Notifications

  Both ATM clients and ATMARP Servers must support generation of a
  ipoaMtuExceed notification.

3.2.  Client Supported MIB Definitions

  The ATMARP Client Table is the only additional MIB table that a client
  must implement.


3.2.1.  ATMARP Client Table

  A entry in the ipoaArpClientTable should have a corresponding
  ipAddrTable entry where both are indexed by the same ipAdEntAddr.
  Refer to the following diagram that illustrates the relationship
  between ipoaArpClientTable and ipAddrTable entries:

  Both tables use the same index, ipAdEntAddr.  The ipAddrTable's
  ipAdEntNetMask when ANDed with its ipAdEntAddr yield the subnet of the
  LIS which indexes the ipoaLisTable. The ipAddrTable's ipAdEntIfIndex
  points to the a physical interface ifTable entry.  The attachment
  point for IP into an ATM network is via an ATM interface's ifIndex.
  This ifIndex is contained in an ipAddrTable entry.

  ipoaArpClientAtmAddr is the local ATM address associated with the
  corresponding ATM ifTable entry. ipoaArpClientSrvrInUse is the ATM

  address of the ATMARP server being used for a particular client. If
  SVCs are not being used then the value of this object is 0.

  It is sometimes possible for a system to have multiple IP addresses
  configured within the same IP subnet. The indexing of this table would
  seem to preclude that, however, it is possible to have additional
  entries in the ipAddrTable with the same ifIndex and with the same
  subnet address. The mechanism for adding these entries to the
  ipAddrTable (which is read-only) is beyond the scope of this document.


3.3.  Server Supported Objects

  ATMARP servers must support:

    o ATMARP Server Table
    o Notifications

  as defined in the following sections. This table exists only on a
  system where at least one ATMARP server is present.


3.3.1.  ATMARP Server Table

  This table defines the list of ATMARP servers within a LIS. Each entry
  of the table defines each ATMARP server's ATM address, the LIS it is a
  member of, and various InATMARP and ATMARP statistics.

  An entry in this table provides information about an ATMARP server
  within a LIS and is indexed by ipAdEntAddr and the ipoaArpSrvrAddr
  (ATM address of the ATMARP server).

  Entries may be created by a management application using the
  ipoaArpSrvrRowStatus object. Entries in this table may also be created
  by the system and not by a management application, for example as a
  result of ILMI.

  Entries in this table may be deleted by setting the
  ipoaArpSrvrRowStatus object to destroy(6). This includes entries that
  were added by the system and not by a management application.


3.3.2.  Notifications

  An ATMARP Server must support the following notifications:

       o ipoaDuplicateIpAddress
       o ipoaLisCreate

Greene et al.        IP and ARP over ATM (IPOA) MIB        21 March 1997


       o ipoaLisDelete

  Generation of ipoaLisCreate and ipoaLisDelete notifications is
  controlled by the ipoaLisTrapEnable object. These notifications
  indicated when a ipoaLisEntry is either created or deleted. The
  purpose of these notifications is to enable Network Management
  Applications to dynamically discover the existence of ATMARP Server
  LIS participation in order to eventually determine LIS composition via
  subsequent SNMP queries.  It is permissible for a ATM client only
  system to support the ipoaLisTrapEnable object and generate
  ipoaLisCreate and ipoaLisDelete notifications.

          may have the same effect on the corresponding ipAddrTable
          entry. An entry in the ipoaArpClientTable has a corresponding
          entry in the ipAddrTable. Both are indexed by ipAdEntAddr.
          The ifIndex and subnet mask of a client entry are the
          ipAddrEntry's ipAdEntIfIndex and ipAdEntNetMask respectively.
          A remote creation of an object in this table requires
          that either the corresponding ipAddrTable entry exists or
          that ipAdEntIfIndex and ipAdEntNetMask be specified in the
          creation of a ipoaArpClientEntry at a minimum in order
          to create the corresponding ipAddrEntry. Specification
          of ipAdEntBcastAddr and ipAdEntReasmMaxSize to complete a
          ipAddrEntry is implementation dependent."
