Internet-Draft    The Camellia XCBC-96 and XCBC-PRF-128   September 2009


Abstract

   This memo specifies two new algorithms.  One is the usage of XCBC
   mode with Camellia block cipher on the authentication mechanism of
   the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload and Authentication Header
   protocols.  This algorithm is called Camellia-XCBC-96.  Latter is
   pseudo-random function based on XCBC with Camellia block cipher for
   Internet Key Exchange.  This algorithm is called Camellia-XCBC-PRF-
   128.

Internet-Draft    The Camellia XCBC-96 and XCBC-PRF-128   September 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies two new algorithms.  One is the usage of XCBC
   based on Camellia block cipher on the authentication mechanism of the
   IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [7] and Authentication
   Header protocols (AH) [6].  This algorithm is called
   Camellia-XCBC-96.  Latter is Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) based on
   XCBC with Camellia block cipher for Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2)
   [8].  This algorithm is called Camellia-XCBC-PRF-128.

   The Camellia algorithm specification and object identifiers are
   described in [2].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

4.  Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document there are no known weak keys for
   Camellia.  And no security problem has been found on Camellia [10],
   [11]

   For other security considerations, please refer to the security
   considerations of the previous use of XCBC mode document described in
   [3] and [4].

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned AH/ESP Authentication Algorithm Value <TBD2> for
   IKEv2 Transform Type 3 (Integrity Algorithm) to CAMELLIA-XCBC-MAC.
   IANA has assigned AH Transform Identifier <TBD1> for IKEv2 Transform
   Type 2 (Pseudo-Random Function) to AH_CAMELLIA-XCBC-MAC.
