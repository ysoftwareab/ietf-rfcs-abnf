Abstract

   L2TP protocol is a virtual extension of PPP across IP network
   infrastructure. L2TP makes possible for an access concentrator(LAC)
   to be near remote clients, while allowing PPP termination server
   (LNS) to be located in enterprise premises. L2TP allows an
   enterprise to retain control of RADIUS data base, which is used
   to control Authentication, Authorization and Accountability (AAA)
   of dial-in users. The objective of this document is to extend
   security characteristics of IPsec to remote access users, as they
   dial-in through the Internet. This is accomplished without creating 
   new protocols and using the existing practices of Remote Access and
   IPsec. Specifically, the LNS node, acting as Secure Remote Access
   Server (SRAS), will mandate IPsec from remote clients, thereby
   ensuring that all IP packets it receives across the Internet are
   authenticated prior to injecting to enterprise network. The document
   also discusses the configuration aspects of SRAS and its limitations.

Internet Draft       Secure Remote Access with L2TP          August 1999




1. Introduction and Overview

   Now-a-days, it is common practice for employees to dial-in to their
   enterprise over the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) and 
   perform day-to-day operations just as they would if they were in 
   corporate premises. This includes people who dial-in from their home
   and road warriors, who cannot be at the corporate premises. As the 
   Internet has become ubiquitous, it is appealing to dial-in through 
   the Internet to save on phone charges and save the dedicated voice 
   lines from being clogged with data traffic.

   The document suggests an approach by which remote access over the
   Internet could become a reality. The approach is founded on the
   well-known techniques and protocols already in place. Remote Access
   extensions based on L2TP, when combined with the security offered 
   by IPSec can make remote access over the Internet a reality. The 
   approach does not require inventing new protocol(s).

   The trust model of remote access discussed in this document is
   viewed principally from the perspective of an enterprise into which
   remote access clients dial-in. A remote access client may or may not
   want to enforce end-to-end IPsec from his/her end to the enterprise.
   However, it is in the interest of the enterprise to mandate security
   of every packet that it accepts from the Internet into the
   enterprise.  Independently, remote users may also pursue end-to-end
   IPsec, if they choose to do so. That would be in addition to the
   security requirement imposed by the enterprise edge device.

   Section 2 has reference to the terminology used throughout the
   document. Also mentioned are the limited scope in which some of these
   terms may be used in this document. Section 3 has a brief description
   of what constitutes remote access. Section 4 describes what
   constitutes network security from an enterprise perspective.
   Section 5 describes the model of secure remote access as a viable
   solution to enterprises. The solution presented in section 5 has some
   limitations. These limitations are listed in section 6.  Section 7 is
   devoted to describing new RADIUS attributes that may be configured to
   turn a NAS device into Secure Remote Access Server.

2. Terminology and scope

   Definition of terms used in this document may be found in one of 
   (a) L2TP Protocol document [Ref 1], (b) IP security Architecture 
   document [Ref 2], or (c) Internet Key Enchange (IKE) document 
   [Ref 5].

   Note, the terms Network Access Server (NAS) and  Remote Access 
   Server(RAS) are used interchangeably throughout the document.
   While PPP may be used to carry a variety of network layer
   packets, the focus of this document is limited to carrying IP
   datagrams only. 
   
   "Secure Remote Access Server" (SRAS) defined in this document 
   refers to a NAS that supports tunnel-mode IPsec with its remote 
   clients. Specifically, LNS is the NAS that is referred.

   Lastly, there are a variety of transport mediums by which to 
   tunnel PPP packets between a LAC and LNS. Examples include 
   Frame Relay or ATM cloud and IP network infrastructure. For 
   simplicity, the document assumes a public IP infrastructure as 
   the medium to transport PPP packets between LAC and LNS. 
   Security of IP packets (embedded within PPP) in a trusted 
   private transport medium is less of a concern for the purposes
   of this document. 


3. Remote Access operation

   Remote access is more than mere authentication of remote clients
   by a Network Access Server(NAS). Authentication, Authorization, 
   Accounting and routing are integral to remote access. A client
   must first pass the authentication test before being granted 
   link access to the network. Network level services (such as IP)
   are granted based on the authorization characteristics
   specificed for the user in RADIUS.  Network Access Servers use
   RADIUS to scale for large numbers of users supported. NAS also
   monitors the link status of the remote access clients.

   There are a variety of techniques by which remote access users
   are connected to their enterprise and the Internet. At a link 
   level, the access techniques include ISDN digital lines, analog 
   plain-old-telephone-service lines, xDSL lines, cable and wireless  
   to name a few. PPP is the most common Layer-2 (L2)protocol used 
   for carrying network layer packets over these remote access 
   links. PPP may be used to carry a variety of network layer 
   datagrams including IP, IPX and AppleTalk. The focus of this 
   document is however limited to IP datagrams only.

   L2TP is a logical extension of PPP over an IP infrastructure. 
   While a LAC provides termination of Layer 2 links,  LNS provides
   the logical termination of PPP. As a result, LNS becomes the 
   focal point for (a) performing the AAA operations for the remote
   users, (b) assigning IP address and monitoring the logical
   link status (i.e., the status of LAC-to-LNS tunnel and the link

   between remote user and LAC), and (c) maintaining host-route to
   remote user network and providing routing infrastructure into
   the enterprise.
   
   L2TP uses control messages to establish, terminate and monitor
   the status of the logical PPP sessions (from remote user to LNS). 
   These are independent of the data messages. L2TP data messages 
   contain an L2TP header, followed by PPP packets. The L2TP header
   identifies the PPP session (amongst other things) to which the 
   PPP packet belongs. The IP packets exchanged from/to the remote 
   user are carried within the PPP packets.  The L2TP data messages, 
   carrying end-to-end IP packets in an IP transport medium may be 
   described as follows. The exact details of L2TP protocol may be 
   found in [Ref 1].

4. Requirements of an enterprise Security Gateway 

   Today's enterprises are aware of the various benefits of 
   connecting to the Internet. Internet is a vast source of 
   Information and a means to disseminate information and make 
   available certain resources to the external world. However, 
   enterprises are also aware that security breaches (by being 
   connected to the Internet) can severely jeopardize internal 
   network.

   As a result, most enterprises restrict access to a pre-defined 
   set of resources for external users. Typically, enterprises 
   employ a firewall to restrict access to internal resources and 
   place externally accessible servers in the DeMilitarized Zone
   (DMZ), in front of the firewall, as described below in figure 1.

   Figure 1: Security model of an Enterprise using Firewall


   Network Access Servers used to allow direct dial-in access 
   (through the PSTN) to employees are placed within the private 
   enterprise network so as to avoid access restrictions imposed 
   by a firewall. 

   With the above model, private resources of an enterprise are 
   restricted for access from the Internet. Firewall may be 
   configured to occasionally permit access to a certain resource 
   or service but is not recommended on an operational basis as 
   that could constitute a security threat to the enterprise. 
   It is of interest to note that even when the firewall is 
   configured to permit access to internal resources from pre-defined
   external node(s), many internal servers, such as NFS, enforce

   address based authentication and do not co-operate when the IP 
   address of the external node is not in corporate IP address 
   domain. In other words, with the above security model, it becomes
   very difficult to allow employees to access corporate resources,
   via the Internet, even if you are willing to forego security 
   over the Internet.

   With the advent of IPsec, it is possible to secure corporate
   data across the Internet by employing a Security Gateway within 
   the enterprise. Firewall may be configured to allow IKE and 
   IPsec packets directed to a specific  Security Gateway behind 
   the firewall. It then becomes the responsibility of the Security 
   Gateway to employ the right access list for external connections
   seeking entry into the enterprise. Essentially, the access control 
   functionality for IPsec secure packets would be shifted to the 
   Security Gateway (while the access control for clear packets is 
   retained with the firewall). The following figure illustrates the 
   model where a combination of Firewall and Security Gateway control 
   access to internal resources.

   Figure 2: Security Model based on Firewall and Security Gateway 


   In order to allow employee dial-in over the Internet, an LNS may 
   be placed behind a firewall, and the firewall may be configured to 
   allow UDP access to the LNS from the Internet. Note, it may not be 
   possible to know all the IP addresses of the LACs located on the 
   Internet at configuration time. Hence, the need to allow UDP access 
   from any node on the Internet. The LNS may be configured to process 
   only the L2TP packets and drop any UDP packets that are not L2TP.

Internet Draft       Secure Remote Access with L2TP          August 1999


   
   Such a configuration allows remote access over the Internet. 
   However, the above setup is prone to a variety of security attacks
   over the Internet. It is easy for someone on the Internet to steal
   a remote access session and gain  access to precious resources of 
   the enterprise. Hence it is important that all packets are 
   preserved with IPsec to a security Gateway (SGW) behind the LNS, 
   so the Security Gateway will not allow IP packets into corporate 
   network unless it can authenticate the same. 
   
   The trust model of secure remote access assumes that the enterprise
   and the end user are trusted domains. Everything in between is not
   trusted. Any examination of the end-to-end packets by the nodes 
   enroute would violate this trust model. From this perspective, even
   the LAC node enroute must not be trusted with the end-to-end IP
   packets. Hence, location and operation of LAC is not relevant for 
   the discussion on security. On the other hand, location and 
   operation of LNS and the Security Gateway (SGW) are precisely the 
   basis for discussion.  

   Having security processing done on an independent Security gateway 
   has the following shortcomings.

   1. Given the trust model for remote access, the SGW must be 
      configured with a set of security profiles, access control lists 
      and IKE authentication parameters for each user. This mandates
      an independent provisioning of security parameters on a per-user
      basis. This may not be able to take advantage of the user-centric
      provisioning on RADIUS, used by the LNS node. 

   2. Unlike the LNS, SGW may not be in the routing path of remote 
      access packets. I.e., there is no guarantee that the egress IP 
      packets wil go through the chain of SGW and LNS before they are 
      delivered to remote user. As a result, packets may be subject 
      to IPSec in one direction, but not in the other. This can be a 
      significant threat to the remote access trust model.

   3. Lastly, the SGW node does not have a way to know when a remote 
      user node(s) simply died or the LAC-LNS tunnel failed. Being 
      unable to delete the SAs for users that no longer exist could 
      drain the resources of the SGW. Further, the LNS cannot even 
      communicate the user going away to the SGW because, the SGW 
      maintains its peer nodes based on IKE user ID, which could be 
      different the user IDs employed by the LNS node.

Internet Draft       Secure Remote Access with L2TP          August 1999


5. Secure Remote Access

   Combining the functions of IPsec Security Gateway and LNS into 
   a single system promises to offer a viable solution for secure 
   remote access. By doing this, remote access clients will use a 
   single node as both (a) PPP termination point providing NAS 
   service, and (b) the Security gateway node into the enterprise. 
   We will refer this node as "Secure Remote Access Server" (SRAS).

   The SRAS can benefit greatly from the confluence of PPP session 
   and IPsec tunnel end points. PPP session monitoring capability 
   of L2TP directly translates to being able to monitor IPsec tunnels. 
   Radius based user authorization ability could be used to configure
   the security characteristics for IPsec tunnel. This includes setting
   access control filters and security preferences specific to each 
   user. This may also be extended to configuring IKE authentication 
   and other negotiation parameters, when automated key exchange is 
   solicited. Security attributes that may be defined in Radius 
   are discussed in detail in section 7. Needless to say, the 
   centralized provisioning capability and scalability of Radius helps 
   in the configuration of IPsec. 
   
   As for remote access, the benefit is one of IPsec security as 
   befitting the trust model solicited by enterprises for the 
   end-to-end IP packets traversing the Internet. You may use simply AH 
   where there is no fear of external eaves-dropping, but you simply
   need to authenticate packet data, including the source of packet. 
   You may use ESP (including ESP-authentication), where there is no 
   trust of the network and you donot want to permit eaves-dropping 
   on corporate activities. 

   Operation of SRAS requires that the firewall be configured to permit 
   UDP traffic into the SRAS node. The SRAS node in turn will process
   just the L2TP packets and drop the rest. Further, the SRAS will 
   require all IP packets embedded within PPP to be one of AH and 
   ESP packets, directed to itself. In addition, the SRAS will also 
   permit IKE UDP packets (with source and destination ports sets 
   to 500) directed to itself in order to perform IKE negotiation
   and generate IPsec keys dynamically. All other IP packets embedded
   within PPP will be dropped. This enforces the security policy for
   the enterprise by permitting only the secure remote access packets 
   into the enterprise. When a PPP session is dropped, the IPsec and 
   ISAKMP SAs associated with the remote access user are dropped from

   Figure 3: Secure Remote Access Server operation in an Enterprise


   The following is an illustration of secure remote access data flow 
   as end-to-end IP packets traverse the Internet and the SRAS. The 
   example shows IP packet tunneling and IPsec transformation as
   packets are exchanged between a remote Access host (RA-Host) and a 
   host within the enterprise (say, Ent-Host).

   Note, the IP packets originating from or directed to RA-Host are 
   shown within PPP encapsulation, whereas, all other packets are shown 
   simply as IP packets.  It is done this way to highlight the PPP 
   packets encapsulated within L2TP tunnel. The PPP headers below are 
   identified by their logical source and destination in parenthesis. 
   Note, however, the source and recipient information of the PPP data
   is not a part of PPP header. This is described thus, just for 
   clarity. In the case of an L2TP tunnel, the L2TP header carries the 
   PPP session ID, which indirectly identifies the PPP end points to the
   LAC and the LNS. Lastly, the IPsec Headers section below include the
   tunneling overhead and the AH/ESP headers that are attached to the
   tunnel.

6. Limitations to Secure Remote Access with L2TP

   The SRAS model described is not without its limitations. Below is
   a list of the limitations.
   
   1. Tunneling overhead: There is considerable tunneling overhead on 
      the end-to-end IP packet. Arguably, there is overlap of 
      information between tunneling headers. This overhead will 
      undercut packet throughput.
      
      The overhead is particularly apparent at the LAC and SRAS nodes.
      Specifically, the SRAS has the additional computational overhead 
      of IPsec processing on all IP packets exchanged with remote 
      users. This can be a significant bottleneck in the ability of 
      SRAS to scale for large numbers of remote users. 

   2. Fragmentation and reassembly: Large IP packets may be required to
      undergo Fragmentation and reassembly at the LAC or the LNS as a 
      result of multiple tunnel overhead tagged to the packet. 
      Fragmentation and reassembly can havoc on packet throughput and
      latency. However, it is possible to avoid the overhead by 
      reducing the MTU permitted within PPP frames. 

   3. Multiple identity and authentication requirement: Remote Access 
      users are required to authenticate themselves to the SRAS in 
      order to be obtain access to the link. Further, when they require 
      the use of IKE to automate IPsec key exchange, they will need to
      authenticate once again with the same or different ID and
      a distinct authentication approach. The authentication 
      requirements of IKE phase 1 [Ref 8] and LCP [Ref 3] are 
      different.
      
      However, it is possible to have a single authentication approach 
      (i.e., a single ID and authentication mechanism) that can be 
      shared between LCP and IKE phase 1.  The Extended Authentication 
      Protocol(EAP) [Ref 4] may be used as the base to transport IKE 
      authentication mechanism into PPP. Note, the configuration
      overhead is not a drag on the functionality perse.

   4. Weak security of Link level authentication: As LCP packets 
      traverse the Internet, the Identity of the remote user and the
      password (if a password is used) is sent in the clear. This makes
      it a target for someone on the net to steal the information and 
      masquerade as remote user. Note, however, this type of password 
      stealing will not jeopardize the security of the enterprise per 
      se, but could result in denial of service to remote users. An
      intruder can collect the password data and simply steal the

      link, but will not be able to run any IP applications 
      subsequently, as the SRAS will fail non-IPsec packet data. 
      
      A better approach would be to employ Extended Authentication 
      Protocol (EAP) [Ref 4] and select an authentication technique 
      that is not prone to stealing over the Internet. Alternately, 
      the LAC and the SRAS may be independently configured to use 
      IPsec to secure all LCP traffic exchanged between themselves.

   
7. Configuring RADIUS to support Secure Remote Access.

   A centralized RADIUS database is used by enterprises to maintain
   the authentication and authorization requirements of the dial-in
   Users. It is also belived that direct dial-in access (e.g., through
   the PSTN network is) safe and trusted and does not need any
   scrutiny outside of the link level authentication enforced 
   in LCP. This belief is certainly not shared with the dial-in 
   access through the Internet.

   So, while the same RADIUS database may be used for a user directly 
   dialing-in or dialing in through the Internet, the security 
   requirements may vary. The following RADIUS attributes may be 
   used to mandate IPsec for the users dialing-in through the Internet.
   The exact values for the attributes and its values may be obtained
   from IANA.

7.1. Security mandate based on access method

   A new RADIUS attribute IPSEC_MANDATE may be defined for each user.
   This attribute may be given one of the following values.

	NONE 		(= 0)    implying no IPsec mandate on the 
				 end-to-end IP packets embedded 
				 within PPP.

	LNS_AS_SRAS	(=1)     implying IPsec mandate on the 
				 end-to-end IPsec packets embedded 
				 within PPP. However, this mandate is 
				 only for an LNS node and the LNS must
				 be the end point for the IPsec packets.

	SRAS		(=2)     implying IPsec mandate only on the
				 end-to-end IPsec packets embedded 
				 within PPP. This mandate is applicable
				 to any NAS node (not specific to an LNS).
				 The NAS node must be the end point for 
				 the IPsec packets.



Srisuresh                                                      [Page 15]

Internet Draft       Secure Remote Access with L2TP          August 1999



  When  the IPSEC_MANDATE attribute is set to one of LNS_AS_SRAS or
  simply SRAS, that would direct the NAS to drop any IP packets in the 
  PPP that are not associated with an AH or ESP protocol. As an 
  exception, the NAS will continue to process IKE packets (UDP packets, 
  with source and destination port set to 500) directed from remote 
  users.

7.2. Security profile for the user 

   Each dial-in user may be assigned a security profile that determines
   the access requirements. The profile could contain information
   such as the access control security filters, security preferences
   and the nature of the Keys (manual or automatic generated via the
   IKE protocol) used for security purposes.

   The SECURITY-PROFILE attribute can be assigned a filename, as a 
   string of characters. The contents of the file could be vendor 
   specific. But, the contents should include (a) a prioritized
   list access control security policies, (b) Security Association
   security preferences associated with each security policy.

7.3. IKE negotiation profile for the user

   If the security profile of the user requires automated key exchange
   dynamically, the parameters necessary for IKE negotiation may be 
   configured separately in a different file. IKE-NEGOTIATION 
   attribute can be assigned a filename, as a string of characters. The 
   contents of the file could however be vendor specific. The contents 
   would typically include (a) the IKE ID of the user and  SRAS, 
   (b) preferred authentication approach and the associated parameters,
   such as pre-shared-key or pointer to the X.509 digital Certificate
   etc., and, (c) ISAKMP security negotiation preferences.
   phase I and the information necessary to authenticate.

Internet Draft       Secure Remote Access with L2TP          August 1999


   This document is about providing secure remote access to 
   enterprises via the Internet. However, the document does 
   not address security issues for network layers other than 
   IP. While the document focus is on security over the 
   Internet, the security model provided is not limited to the
   Internet or the IP infrastructure alone. It may also be 
   applied over other L2TP tunnel transport transport media 
   such as Frame Relay and ATM clouds. If the transport media 
   is a trusted private network infrastructure, the security 
   measures described may not be as much of an issue. The 
   solution suggested in the document is keeping in view the
   trust model between the remote user and enterprise.


10. IANA Considerations

   This document defines a total of three "magic" number attributes 
   to be maintained by the IANA.  The following sub-section explains 
   the criteria to be used by the IANA to assign additional numbers 
   as values to the IPSEC-MANDATE attribute described in section 7.1.

10.1.  IPSEC-MANDATE attribute Value

   Values 0-2 of the IPSEC-MANDATE-Type Attribute are defined in 
   Section 7.1; the remaining values are available for assignment 
   by the IANA with IETF Consensus [Ref 11].
