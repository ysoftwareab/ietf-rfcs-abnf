   Abstract

   This memorandum describes a proposed mechanism under which differing
   schemes for the naming, allocation and management of new
   international top-level domains may be tried without their
   interfering with each other.

   This memorandum discusses the trademrk issues underlying the current
   debate on International TLDs, and proposes non-interfering
   simultaneous experiments, following the proposals of
   [DENNINGER],[HIGGS],[MASEK] and [POSTEL].

   This memo is being distributed to the Internet community in order to
   solicit their opinions of the proposals contained in it. In
   particular, The IETF, IANA, NEWDOM SHARED-TLD and related mailing
   lists are invited to read and comment on this material.

Introduction

   This paper was written to inform the community, to suggest adapting
   existing practices of the IETF (two implementations before
   standardization) to a mixed technical and political problem and to
   suggest means by which this practice could be carried out.

   It was once pointed out to the author that it was a serious error to
   try to deal with a problem indirectly, without explicitly stating the
   problem and taking account of it in the solutions.

   This paper therefor directly raises the question of how much the U.S.
   and world trademark system affects domain names, and particularly
   domain name in the international top-level domains.  Following that
   it considers what effects particular proposed changes in the
   available domains might reasonably have on the trademark issues.
   This is the main body of the paper, and is written in the form of an

   appreciation of the situation.

   The paper draws some interim conclusions, and suggests further work
   before we settling on a final solution or set of solutions.

   Finally, it points out means by which we can continue the
   investigation without interference with the proposals of Postel at
   all.

Historical Background

   Commercial organizations have recently found problems with the
   availability of particular domain names, since they have generally
   fallen into the practice of requesting their business names and
   trademarks as their domain names.

   Since the current domain naming scheme is a naming scheme, designed
   to map arbitrary but meaningful names into IP numbers, the business
   community rapidly fell into difficulties with the fact that domain
   names are unique.  There can only be one ``united'' subdomain in the
   ``.com'' top-level domain, for example.

   Alas, ``United Airlines'' and ``United Vanlines'' and presumably
   ``United Trucklines'' all use the word United as part of their
   trademark, and might well all desire the ```united.com'' domain.

   This has caused difficulties and bad feelings, exacerbated by the
   resolution policies which the operator of the .com registry has tried
   in order to deal with the problem.

   The problem is moderately serious, in that it affects major
   commercial organizations.  It does not pose a threat to the operation
   of the net, but does pose problems in its use by commercial
   organizations, especially international organizations which wish to
   register in the international top-level domain ``.com''.

   There is great interest and debate about the problem, however, as it
   is very topical.  Several IETF and ISOC-related conferences have
   included sessions on the subject and numerous initiatives have
   commenced:


        Several proposals [DENNINGER],[HIGGS],[MASEK],[POSTEL] have been
        made, in the form of internet drafts, to create additional top-
        level domains.

        One organization, ALTERNIC, has commenced an initiative to
        register and serve these additional experimental top-level

INTERNET DRAFT                                            September 1996


        domains.

        Numerous organizations have applied to be registries for the new
        domains when a procedure to do so is standardized.

Trademark Issues

   Trademark is a well-studied and well-understood subject in jurispru-
   dence and business practice.

   Trademark law keeps one manufacturer from misrepresenting his goods
   as someone else's, by protecting the first user of a mark from others
   who might try to use identical or misleadingly similar marks.

   Like domain-names, they are established by someone starting to use
   them.  Also like domain names, they are unique.  However, because
   there are only so many words in the english (or any other) language,
   they have come to be used as "proper adjectives".  We say the Allied
   van lines, Esso gasoline or the Unix timesharing system.  The use of
   a category serves to disambiguate the trademark from other, similar,
   ones.

   Similarly, they are often geographically disambiguated: one can have
   Judy's Cafe in Tucson Arizona and Judy's Cafe in El Paso, Texas.
   Most jurisdictions allow registry of trademarks within that particu-
   lar state or country as a part of the use of the legal system to pro-
   tect them. There are internationally known trademarks, but there are
   only voluntary means of settling disputes about those.

   In common usage, a trademark is often used as part of a phrase, such
   as ``the Unix timesharing system'' or ``Standard Oil of New Jersey''.
   This is a distinguished name, the thing from which it is dis-
   tinguished and sometimes a broader category.  In domain-name notation
   these might be stated as ``unix.operatingsystems'' and
   ``standard.oilrefiners.nj''.

   As such, several proposals have been made to employ a similar disam-
   biguation in the allocation of domain names to such companies.
   Expanding on this is the contents of the next part of the paper, an
   appreciation (cf Appendix A) of the possible naming schemes which
   might be employed.

Appreciation of the Situation

   Aim

      The aim of the appreciation is to provide in brief the material
      factors and plausible courses of action which a body setting out

      the form of future top-level domain names will need to consider.

      The paper is limited to discussing issues centered around the form
      of domain names and their interaction with trademark and trademark
      litigation.

      Criteria for choosing a solution sufficient to meet best current
      practice standards have been proposed in [AGMON].

      It is the intention of the author to advance discussion, not to
      exclude or propose particular courses.

   Factors

      Trademarks

         The primary factor in this discussion is the issue of trademark
         on names which organizations wish to use as domain names.

         There is a rich history of jurisprudence on the subject: for
         our purposes, a trademark holder which wishes to establish a
         presence on the internet may wish:

           A domain name identical to one or more of their trademarks
           (referred to in the rest of the document as [identical]).

           Protection against dilution of their trademark from the use
           of a similar name as a domain name by another party on the
           net (referred to henceforth as [dilution]).

         Companies registering domains in the United States have evi-
         denced such desires, with numerous lawsuits currently underway.
         This is exacerbated by the conflict resolution mechanisms used
         by NSI, the U.S. InterNIC operator.  However, it should be
         noted that this problem has not yet become significant in any
         of the national top-level domains.

         A further variant is that some trademark holders, notably of
         very well-known names, have expressed an intention to register
         their name in all applicable domains, to proactively prevent
         infringement or dilution in any context.  This is especially
         true of well-known multinational companies,  and conflicts in
         suhc registration is a known problem in the allocation of 800
         numbers (referred to as [all domains] below).

INTERNET DRAFT                                            September 1996


      Inferrability

         A second factor is the desire of the companies registering
         domain to have their domain names ``guessable'' from their com-
         pany names (referred to in the following as [guessable]).

         For example, a company named ``SeaTech'' might wish the domain
         ``seatech.com''.  With a name of this form, persons made aware
         of it would assume that it was doing business throughout North
         America (and indeed the world), and that one could send mail to
         <persons-name>@seatech.com and find their web page at
         www.seatech.com.


         If the company does not have a short, unique name, it is to
         their advantage to have a name which can be found by a domain
         name system or web search.  For example, the American Airlines
         web page can be found in a few seconds as
         ``www.americanair.com'' by an Alta Vista search for ``american
         airlines''.

   Courses of Action

      Course 0: Do Nothing.

         We could, of course, do nothing. This would leave us with a
         problem in the .com domain, and place the responsibility for
         solving it on the NIC operator.

         Based on their lack of success to date, this is probably
         inadvisable.

         (Course 0 is always ``do nothing'', and is conventionally
         included to ensure that all reasonable courses of action are
         considered.  This includes a failure to make a decision, which
         is implicitly an unintentional decision to do nothing.)

      Course 1: Revert to First-Come, First Served

         We could revert to allocating domain names in .com and the
         other existing domains to the first person requesting them,
         without other conditions.  This would not directly address
         either of the above problems, but would remove the NIC operator
         from the center of the debate, as they could merely disclaim
         responsibility for trademark problems, require the parties to
         go to court, and agree to abide by the result.

         In the case of either identical or very similar names, the



Collier-Brown                                                   [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT                                            September 1996


         trademark holders would have to ``fight it out'' in court.
         [identical][dilution]

         As there would only be a single international .com domain (and
         some similar national domains), the ability of a company which
         holds a trademark in the airline business to distinguish itself
         from one which holds the same trademark in the trucking busi-
         ness would be limited.

         Litigation would presumably continue in the international
         domain and to a lesser degree in national domains.

         Companies desiring a presence in all domains would need only to
         establish a single international domain, in .com, and might
         attempt to establish domains in national domains, .edu and/or
         .org [all domains]

         Company's domain names would be in one sense hard to guess, as
         there is no rule about which trademark holder would get the
         domain in .com.  In another sense, they would be easy to guess,
         so long as you wanted the site of the winner of the race to
         register.

         Other trademark holders might elect to add distinguishing words
         to their domain names, such as ``americanair'' or ``allied-
         vanlines''.[guessable]

         There would be little or no effect on domains looked up via
         search services.

      Course 2: Synonyms

         We could establish more domains in parallel to .com, such as
         .biz, an existing experimental top-level domain.

         Companies desiring the ``same'' name as another could simply
         register in .biz as opposed to .com, so that allied.biz would
         be united vanlines and united.com would be united
         airlines.[identical]

         This would not address the dilution problem, however: there
         would be ``two'' uniteds, with nothing to distinguish between
         them in the mind of the customer save which synonym for ``busi-
         ness'' they were registered under.  It is likely that at least
         one allied would be displeased with this lack of differentia-
         tion and ask for relief on the basis of dilution of their
         trademark.[dilution]

INTERNET DRAFT                                            September 1996


         Companies inclined to defend their trademarks strongly would
         attempt to register the same domain in all synonymous domains.
         This would be a brand-new point of contention between trademark
         holders in different businesses.[all domains]

         Company names would be hard to guess, as there would be a com-
         ponent of the domain name which would not be predictable (which
         synonym) and which would have to be memorized or looked up by
         the customer.[guessable]

         There would be little effect on domains looked up via search
         services, and more people would find it necessary to use such
         services.

      Course 3: Meaningless Names

         We could establish domains whose names were meaningless: for
         example, we could have .AAA, .AAB, .AAC and so on, and allow or
         coerce companies to register in randomly-chose ones.

         If we allowed companies to register in the one of their choice,
         many companies would choose domains meaningful to them, with
         many desiring to be in the first, last or most meaningful
         domain.

         Companies desiring the ``same'' name as another could simply
         register in a different domain, so that allied.aaa might be
         united vanlines and united.bbb might be united
         airlines.[identical]

         This would not address the dilution problem, however: there
         would be ``two'' uniteds, with nothing to distinguish between
         them in the mind of the customer save a random string. It is
         likely that companies would be displeased with this lack of
         differentiation and ask for relief on the basis of dilution of
         their trademark by someone in another domain.[dilution]

         Companies inclined to defend their trademarks strongly would
         attempt to register the same domain in all random domains.
         This would be (like .biz/.com) a new point of contention
         between trademark holders in different businesses.[all domains]

         Company names would be hard to guess, as there would be a com-
         ponent of the domain name which would be random and which would
         have to be memorized or looked up by the customer.[guessable]

         As before, there would be little effect on domains looked up
         via search services, and more people would find it necessary to

         use such services.

      Course 4: Meaningful Names

         We could establish domains whose names were meaningful business
         categories drawn from existing trademark categories established
         by national bodies or international agreement. For example, we
         could have .soap, and names like lever-brothers.soap for the
         cleaner-related branches of Lever Brothers.

         This is also called a controlled vocabulary, and is commonly
         used in library searching and categorization (eg, the U.S.
         Library of Congress system).

         Companies wishing to have identical domain names, if in dif-
         ferent categories, would simply register their desired name.
         We could have american.buslines and american.airlines without
         difficulty.  If the categories are over-broad, we would have
         problems with clashes, such as if bus-, truck- and air-lines
         were all grouped together under the .transport
         domain.[identical]

         Companies fearing dilution would suffer directly only if the
         categories were over-broad.  They could suffer dilution if the
         general public was inclined to assume that the same ``united''
         operated united.vanlines, united.airlines and united.buslines.
         This is possible, but appears far-fetched.[dilution]

         Companies desiring to protect their trademark by defending it
         broadly would find it difficult and expensive to justify regis-
         tration in a very large number of arguably inappropriate
         domains.  If the bozotron company wished to proactively defend
         its good name by registering bozotron.soap, while not manufac-
         turing soap, there would be room for litigation if a soap com-
         pany with bozotron as a trademark desired the bozotron.soap
         domain. [all domains] (This might be a solved problem in trade-
         mark law: comments are invited from the reader.)

         Domain names would be relatively guessable, given a small
         enough set of categories and some experience with the system by
         the customer.  Persons unsure of the business categories would
         need to look those up with a search service.  Persons who do
         not know the business's category, only its name, would have to
         use search services, as above.[guessable]

      Course 5: Obfuscated Meaningful Names

         We could establish domains whose names were meaningful business
         categories, but refer to them by the category number, thus giv-
         ing us C10, C02 and so forth.

         This has a result indistinguishable from random names, save the
         names will not chance to match meaningful short words.  If the
         obfuscation were progressively less effective, such that
         categories could be inferred to increasing degrees from the
         names, it would come more and more to resemble meaningful
         names.

      Course 6: Unconstrained Names

         We could establish domains with unconstrained names: any organ-
         ization could propose a name and have it made a top-level
         domain.

         This is in fact the former case within .com, with the limita-
         tion that only nominally commercial entities can be registered.
         Films are seemingly businesses, however, so the limitation is
         not absolute.

         This has a result indistinguishable from reverting to first-
         come first-served in com, save that the load on the root name
         servers would be remarkable, as most enquiries would have to go
         to them.

      Course 7: Partially Unconstrained Names

         We could allow names to be drawn from a vocabulary which is
         constrained only in that it distinguishes different kinds of
         business.  This might start with the existing categories and
         subcategories established in international trademark law, and
         be expanded by reference to the literature of trademark with
         more and more precise terms.  For example, transportation might
         be an initial category, from which companies might well ask
         that trucklines, buslines and airlines be added, sufficient to
         distinguish their businesses.  Companies doing business in
         several specific subcategories would have the option of regis-
         tering in each (x.trucklines and x.railways) or in the parent
         category (x.transport).

         Companys seeking to distinguish themselves would ask for regis-
         tration in the category that most accurately describes their
         business, to avoid being mistaken for another, like-named
         business.[identical]

         Companies concerned with dilution might choose more specific
         names, to avoid anyone mistaking them for someone else.  In
         effect, the category they choose would become closely associ-
         ated with their names (eg, the Unix[tm] Timesharing System) and
         would appear to the customer to be part of the name.[dilution]

         Companies wishing to defend their trademarks strongly could
         regard the above as sufficient.  If not, they would have the
         option of trying to register their name in all domains where
         they believed there was a chance some-one might use the same
         name.  This would be expensive and time-consuming, though: the
         International Olympic Committee might well find itself faced
         with registering olympic.restaurant.brampton.on.ca in one known
         extreme case.  [all domains]

         Names would be guessable, but less so than with a more con-
         trolled vocabulary.  A search service with a knowledge of the
         requisite synonyms would be straightforward to provide,
         however.[guessable]

      Course 9: Retire the International Domains

         We could cease registering domains in the international top-
         level domains.

         The problem would immediately be relocated to the registries
         and courts of individual countries.  This would be very similar
         to reverting to first-come, first-served in .com, save it would
         now be in (eg) .com.us and presumably in .com.az.us.

         In the case of either identical or very similar names, the
         trademark holders would have to ``fight it out'' in court, but
         would have a clear indication of what court system to use.
         [identical][dilution]

         Companies which were in different jurisdictions such as Judy's
         Cafe in Tucson AZ and Judy's Cafe in El Paso, Texas, would be
         able to easily distinguish themselves from one another.  Com-
         panies in the same jurisdiction would still suffer from the
         inability to distinguish airlines from the like-named companies
         in the trucking business. Litigation would presumably continue
         over these issues.

         Companies desiring a presence in all domains would need to
         establish themselves in all possible national domains.  [all
         domains]

         Company's domain names would be substantially easier to guess:



Collier-Brown                                                  [Page 11]

INTERNET DRAFT                                            September 1996


         one would have to have an idea of how wide an area they do
         business in in order to know whether to look in .com.us or
         .com.tucson.az.us.  This has not proved a problem un the .ca
         domain, where a similar scheme is employed.[guessable]

      Course 9: Restrict the .com Domain to Multinationals

         This would separate the problem into two: one relocatable, as
         in the previous example, and one in correspondingly less chance
         of clashes.  As multinationals tend to avoid name-clashes in
         any case, this might significantly reduce the size of the prob-
         lem.  [identical][dilution]

         Multinationals also are among the main companies who desire to
         protect their trademarks strongly and proactively.  [all
         domains]

         Otherwise, the analysis is the same as the last case.

      Course 10: Combinations

         Finally, we might elect to try combinations of courses based on
         their relative strengths and weaknesses.

         It is plausible to have constrained or partially constrained
         names with a special category for companies who are both
         inclined to protect their trademarks strongly and who are
         internationally known.  If Ortel found it necessary to defend
         its name against all similar names (eg, Nortel), then it might
         ask for a higher-level domain than all other companies.  In the
         root if necessary, in .com if all the categories were to exist
         within .com.

         It is also plausible to have combinations of geography in sub-
         national domains, and categories in national and international
         domains.

   Conclusions

      Contrary to the author's previous opinion, it appears that some
      combination of courses might meet the needs of copyright holders
      as set out in the factors section above, and the public policy
      recommendations of [AGMON].

      Nevertheless, it is not apparent at this time what the correct
      combination might be.

Recommendations

   The author recommends further study.

   Allow the experiment to continue: this would allow allow multiple
   different streams of development, inclusing those of Postel, Higgs,
   Denninger, and similar experiments by autonomous national domains
   (eg, .ca)

   This is a direct parallell to the normal practice of requiring multi-
   ple working implementations before proceeding to standardization.
   The difference here is that at least two working instances of a
   viable (if imperfect) solution might be asked for, rather than two
   examples of working code.


   Set groundrules so there would be no ``pollution'' of one experiment
   by another: keep the experiments orthogonal to one another, so suc-
   cess in a particular aspect could be clearly identified.

   The author suggests commercial vs non-commercial registries (done),
   shared versus singular-registry domains,  synonym domains vs
   categories (using unshared registries) and shared registries (using
   any domain or domains).

   Run the experiment for no less that one year nor more than two.

Mechanism

   IANA shall seperate the namespaces.

   The IANA shall reserve names from the U.S. and International Trade-
   mark Classes for use by category-based top-level domains. It shall
   authorize the creation of top-level domains with names which appear
   on the World Intellectual Property Organizations' list, or in the
   U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's ``Trademark Acceptable Identifica-
   tion of Goods and Services Manual'' only for experiments in categori-
   cal naming.  Suitable forms of the main categories will be acccepted
   by the IANA for such categorical domains, and at their sole discre-
   tion, names of sub-categories may be made available if in IANA's
   opinion the category is over-broad.  IANA shall refrain from author-
   izing any top-level domains synonymous with those names.  These names
   are enumerated in Appendix B below, and forms suitable for use as
   domain names are partially enumerated in [HIGGS].

   IANA shall expressly permit creation of new top-level domains
   synonymous to others, including existing domains, so long as they are
   not synonymous with these categories.

INTERNET DRAFT                                            September 1996


   Finally, IANA shall permit at its discretion the creation of other
   top-level domains, with naming schemes not discussed here, so long as
   they are not synonymous with either of the above.

   Within these new top-level domains, IANA shall reserve all second-
   level names which match existing top-level domains categories and
   sub-categories, to avoid the inadvertent creation of ambigous, redun-
   dant or non-meaningfull domains such as oil.oil.

   IANA may elect to authorize multi-level categorizations like
   lubricants.oil if, after initial experimentation, it is their opinion
   that such are desirable in place of or in addition to narrowly
   defined top-level domains.

   appreciations is taught as a means of clarifying one's thoughts about
   difficult problems.

   An appreciation has /in +2
   a single aim, stated without the use of ``and'' or ``or'',
   limitations, which may constrain the problem,
   factors, each of which affects at least one course of action,
   courses of action, each of which is affected by some or all of the
   factors, and
   a conclusion.

 All courses are annotated with the names of the factors which affect
 them.

 Readers are encouraged to look for missing relevant factors, missing
 courses of action, factors which are not used by any (or some) of the
 courses and courses which do not follow from the factors which sup-
 posedly affect them.
