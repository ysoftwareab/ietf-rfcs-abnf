 Extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol for
                   Enhanced Errors and Notifications
                 draft-ietf-pce-enhanced-errors-05.txt

Abstract

   This document defines new error and notification TLVs for the PCE
   Communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440].  It identifies the possible
   PCEP behaviors in case of error or notification.  Thus, this draft
   defines types of errors and how they are disclosed to other PCEs in
   order to support predefined PCEP behaviors.

Internet-Draft   Extensions to PCEP for Enhanced errors    February 2019


1.  Terminology

   PCE terminology is defined in [RFC4655].

   PCEP Peer: An element involved in a PCEP session (i.e. a PCC or a
   PCE).

   Source PCC: the PCC, for a given path computation query, initiating
   the first PCEP request, which may then trigger a chain of successive
   requests.

   Target PCE: the PCE that can compute a path to the destination
   without having to query any other PCE.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Introduction

   The PCE Communication Protocol [RFC5440] is designed to be flexible
   and extensible in order to allow future evolutions or specific
   constraint support such as proposed in [RFC7470].  Crossing different
   PCE implementations (e.g. from different providers or due to
   different releases), a PCEP request may encounter unknown errors or
   notification messages.  In such a case, the PCEP RFC [RFC5440]
   specifies to send a specific error code to the PCEP peer.  This
   document updates [RFC5440] by introducing mechanism to propagate the
   error message, with specifying error and notification TLVs.

   In the context of path computation crossing different routing domains
   or autonomous systems, the number of different PCE system
   specificities is potentially high, thus possibly leading to divergent
   and unstable situations.  Such phenomenon can also occur in
   homogeneous cases since PCE systems have their own policies that can
   introduce differences in requests treatment even for requests having
   the same destination.  In order to generalize PCEP behaviors in the
   case of heterogeneous PCE systems, new objects have to be defined.
   Dealing with heterogeneity is a major challenge considering PCE
   applicability, particularly in multi-layer, multi-domain and H-PCE
   contexts [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-hpce].  Thus, extending such error
   codes and PCEP behaviors accordingly would improve interoperability
   among different PCEP implementations and would solve some of these
   issues.  However, some of them would still remain (e.g. the
   divergences in request treatment introduced by different policies).

Internet-Draft   Extensions to PCEP for Enhanced errors    February 2019


   The purpose of this draft is to identify and specify new optional
   TLVs and objects in order to generalize PCEP behaviors.

3.1.  Examples

   The two following scenarios underline the need for a normalization of
   the PCEP behaviors according to existing error or notification types.

3.1.1.  Error use-case

   PCE(i-1) has sent a request to PCE(i) which has also sent a request
   to PCE(i+1).  PCE(i-1) and PCE(i+1) have the same error semantic but
   not PCE(i).  If PCE(i+1) throws an error type and value unknown by
   PCE(i).  PCE(i) could then adopt any other behaviors and sends back
   to PCE(i-1) an error of type 2 (Capability not supported), 3 (Unknown
   Object) or 4 (Not supported Object) for instance.  As a consequence,
   the path request would be cancelled but the error has no meaning for
   PCE(i-1) whereas if PCE(i) had simply forwarded the error sent by
   PCE(i+1), it would have been understood by PCE(i-1).

3.1.2.  Notification use-case

   PCE(i-1) has sent a request to PCE(i) which has also sent a request
   to PCE(i+1) but PCE(i+1) is overloaded.  Without extensions, PCE(i+1)
   should send a notification of type 2 and a value flag giving its
   estimated congestion duration.  PCE(i) can choose to stop the path
   computation and send a NO_PATH reply to PCE(i-1).  Hence, PCE(i-1)
   ignores the congestion duration on PCE(i+1) and could seek it for
   further requests.

4.  PCEP Behaviors

   One of the purposes of the PCE architecture is to compute paths
   across networks, but an added value is to compute such paths in
   inter-area/layer/domain environments.  The PCE Communication Protocol
   [RFC5440] is based on the Transport Communication Protocol (TCP).
   Thus, to compute a path within the PCE architecture, several TCP/PCEP
   sessions have to be set up, in a peer-to-peer manner, along a set of
   identified PCEs.

   When the PCEP session is up for two PCEP peers, the PCC of the first
   PCE System (the source PCC) sends a PCReq message.  If the PCC does
   not receive any reply before the dead timer is out, then it goes back
   to the idle state.  A PCC can expect two kinds of replies: a PCRep
   message containing one or more valid paths (EROs) or a negative PCRep
   message containing a NO-PATH object.

Internet-Draft   Extensions to PCEP for Enhanced errors    February 2019


   Beside PCReq and PCRep messages, notification and error messages,
   named respectively PCNtf and PCErr, can be sent.  There are two types
   of notification messages: type 1 is for cancelling pending requests
   and type 2 for signaling a congestion of the PCE.  Several error
   values are described in [RFC5440].  The error types concerning the
   session phase begin at 2, error type 1 values are dedicated to the
   initialization phase.

   As the PCE Communication Protocol is built to work in a peer-to-peer
   manner (i.e. supported by a TCP Connection), it supposes that the
   "deadtimer" of the source PCC is long enough to support the end-to-
   end distributed path computation process.

   The exchange of messages in the PCE Communication Protocol is
   described in details when PCEP is in states OpenWait and KeepWait in
   [RFC5440].  When the session is up, message exchange is defined in
   [RFC5440].  [RFC5441] describes the Backward Recursive Path
   Computation (BRPC) procedure, and, because it considers an inter-
   domain path computation, gives a bigger picture of the possible
   behaviors when the session is up.  Detailed behavior is mostly let
   free to any specific implementation.  The following sections
   identifies the PCEP behaviors in case of error or notification and
   also introduce the requirement of PCEP peer identification in both
   cases.

4.1.  PCEP Behaviors in Case of Error

   [RFC5440] specifies that "a PCEP Error message is sent in several
   situations: when a protocol error condition is met or the request is
   not compliant with the PCEP specification".  On this basis, and
   according to the other RFCs, the identified PCEP behaviors are the
   followings:

   o  "Propagation": the received message requires to be propagated
      forwardly or backwardly (depending on which PCEP peer has sent the
      message) to a set of PCEP peers;

   o  "Criticality level": in different RFCs, error-types affects the
      state of the PCEP request or session in different manners; hence,
      different level of criticality can be observed:

   o

      *  Low-level of criticality: the received message does not affect
         the PCEP connection and further answer can still be expected;






Pouyllau, et al.         Expires August 19, 2019                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   Extensions to PCEP for Enhanced errors    February 2019


      *  Medium-level of criticality: the received message does not
         affect the PCEP connection but the request(s) is(are)
         cancelled;

      *  High-level of criticality: the received message indicates that
         the PCEP peer will close the session with its peer (and so
         pending requests associated by the error, if any, are
         cancelled.)

   The high-level of criticality has been extracted from [RFC5440] which
   associates such a behavior to error-type of 1 (errors raised during
   the PCEP session establishment).  Hence, such errors are quite
   specific.  For the sake of completeness, they have been included in
   this document.

4.2.  PCEP Behaviors in Case of Notification

   Notification messages can be employed in two different manners:
   during the treatment of a PCEP request, or independently from it to
   advertise information (in [RFC5440], the request ID list within a
   PCNtf message is optional).  Hence, three different types of
   behaviors can be identified:

   o  "Local": the notification does not imply any forward or backward
      propagation of the message;

   o  "Request-specific propagation": the received message requires to
      be propagated forwardly or backwardly (depending on which peer has
      sent the message) to the PCEP peers;

   o  "Non request-specific propagation": the received message must be
      propagated to any known peers (e.g. if PCE discovery is activated)
      or to a list of identified peers.

4.3.  PCE Peer Identification

   The propagation of errors and notifications affects the state of the
   PCEP peers along the chain.  In some cases, for instance a
   notification that a PCE is overloaded, the identification of the PCEP
   peer - or that the sender PCE is not the direct neighbor - might be
   an important information for the PCEP peers receiving the message.
   The ID of sender PCE is not carried in the error TLVs, but can be
   achieved via the speaker entity ID TLV during state synchronization.
   An example can be found in [RFC8232].

5.  PCEP Extensions for Error and Notification Handling

   This section describes extensions to support error and notification
   with respect to the PCEP behavior description defined in Section 4.
   This document does not intend to modify errors and notification types
   previously defined in existing documents (e.g.  [RFC5440], [RFC5441],
   etc.).  Error related TLVs have been specified in this section, while
   the notification functionality can be achieved via using PCNtf
   message with RP object with no need to extend further notification
   type.

5.1.  Propagation TLV

   To support the propagation behavior mentioned in Section 4.1 and
   Section 4.2, a new optional TLV is defined, which can be carried in
   PCEP-ERROR and NOTIFICATION objects, to indicate whether a message
   has to be propagateed or not.  The allocation from the "PCEP TLV Type
   Indicators" sub-registry will be assigned by IANA and the request is
   documented in Section 10.

   The description is "Propagation", the length value is 2 bytes and the
   value field is 1 byte.  The value field is set to 0 meaning that the
   message MUST NOT be propagated.  If the value field is set to 1, the
   message MUST be propagated.  Section 5.4 specifies the destination
   and to limit the number of messages.

5.2.  Error-criticality TLV

   To support the shutdown behavior mentioned in Section 4.1, we extend
   the PCEP-ERROR object by creating a new optional TLV to indicate
   whether an error is recoverable or not.  The allocation from the
   "PCEP TLV Type Indicators" sub-registry will be assigned by IANA and
   the request is documented in Section 10.

   The description is "Error-criticality", the length value is 2 bytes
   and the value field is 1 byte.  The value field is set to 0 meaning
   that the error has a low-level of criticality (so further messages
   can be expected for this request).  If the value field is set to 1,
   the error has a medium-level of criticality and requests whose
   identifiers appear in the same message MUST be cancelled (so no
   further messages can be expected for these requests).  If the value
   field is set to 2, the error has a high-level of criticality, the
   connection for this PCEP session is closed by the sender PCE peer.

Internet-Draft   Extensions to PCEP for Enhanced errors    February 2019


5.3.  Behaviors and TLV combinations

   The propagation behavior MAY be combined with all criticality levels,
   thus leading to 6 different behaviors.  In the case of a criticality
   level of 2, the session is closed by the PCE peer which sends the
   message.  Hence, the criticality level is purely informative for the
   PCE peer which receives the message.  If it is combined with a
   propagation behavior, then the PCE propagating the message MUST
   indicate the same level of criticality if it closes the session.
   Otherwise, it MUST use a criticality level of 1 if it does not close
   the session.

   For a PCErr message, all the possible behaviors described in
   Section 4.1 can be covered with TLVs included in a PCEP-ERROR object.
   The following table captures all combinations of error behaviors:


   | Error      \Propogation|      0       |       1      |
   | criticallity\ Value    | (   No       |(Propogation  |
   |  value       \         | Propagation) |  Required)   |
   |------------------------------------------------------|
   |      0 (low)           |    Type 1    |   Type 4     |
   |      1 (medium)        |    Type 2    |   Type 5     |
   |      2 (high)          |    Type 3    |   Type 6     |
   |------------------------------------------------------|



   o  "Error Behavior Type 1" : Local Error with a low level of
      criticality;

   o  "Error Behavior Type 2": Local Error with a medium level of
      criticality;

   o  "Error Behavior Type 3": Local Error with a high level of
      criticality;

   o  "Error Behavior Type 4": Propagated Error with a low level of
      criticality;

   o  "Error Behavior Type 5": Propagated Error with a medium level of
      criticality;

   o  "Error Behavior Type 6": Propagated Error with a high level of
      criticality;

5.4.  Propagation Restrictions TLVs

   In order to limit the propagation of errors and notifications, the
   following mechanisms SHOULD be used:

      A Time-To-Live(TTL) RLV: to limit the number of PCEP peers that
      will recursively receive the message;

      A DIFFUSION-LIST TLV: to specify the PCEP peer addresses or
      domains of PCEP peers the message must be propagate to;

      History mechanism: if a PCEP peer keeps track of the messages it
      has relayed, it could avoid propagating an error or notification
      it has already received.

   Such mechanisms SHOULD be used jointly or independently depending the
   error or notification behaviors they are associated to.  The
   conditions of use for the TTL and DIFFUSION-LIST TLVs are described
   in sections below.

5.4.1.  Time-To-Live (TTL) TLV

   The TTL value is set to any integer value to indicate the number of
   PCEP peers that will recursively receive the message.  The TTL TLV
   SHOULD be used with propagated errors or notifications ("Propagation"
   TLV with value 1 in PCEP-ERROR or NOTIFICATION objects).  Each PCEP
   peer MUST decrement the TTL value before propagating the message.
   When the TTL value becomes 0, the message is no more propagated.

   If the message to be propagated is request-specific and there is no
   TTL or DIFFUSION-LIST TLVs included, the message MUST reach the
   source PCC (or alternatively the target PCE).

5.4.2.  DIFFUSION-LIST TLV

   The DIFFUSION-LIST TLV can be carried within either the error object
   of a PCErr message, or the notification object of a PCNtf message.
   It can either be used in a message sent by a PCC to a PCE or vice
   versa.  The DIFFUSION-LIST MAY be used with propagated errors (TLV
   "Propagation"at value 1 in PCEP-ERROR object).

   The format of the DIFFUSION-LIST object body is as follows:

   Type (16 bits): restricts the diffusion to certain peers.  The
   following values are currently defined:

      0: Any PCEP peer indicated in the list must be reached.

      1: Only PCEs must be reached (and not PCC).

      2: All PCEP peers with which a session is still opened must be
      reached.

   The value of DIFFUSION-LIST is made of sub-objects similar to the IRO
   defined in [RFC5440].  The following sub-object types are supported.

   If the error or notification codes target specific PCEP peers, a
   DIFFUSION-LIST TLV avoids partially flooding all PCEP peers.  Any
   PCEP peer receiving a PCErr or PCNTf message containing a PCEP-ERROR
   or a NOTIFICATION object with a TLV "Propagation" at value 1 and
   where a DIFFUSION-LIST appears, MUST remove the addresses of the PCEP
   peers from the DIFFUSION-LIST, before sending the message to any
   other PCEP peers.  This is performed by adding the PCEP peer
   addresses to the Explicit eXclusion Route Sub-object of the
   DIFFUSION-LIST.  If a DIFFUSION-LIST value is empty, the PCEP peer
   MUST NOT propagate the message to any peer.

   Note that, a Diffusion-List could contain strict or loose addresses
   to refer to a network domain (e.g. an Autonomous System number, an
   OSPF area, an IP address).  Hence, the PCEP peers targeted by the
   message would be the PCEP peers covering the corresponding domain.
   If an address is loose, each time a PCEP peer forwards a message to
   another PCEP peer of this address, it MUST add it own address to the
   Explicit eXclusion Route Sub-object (EXRS) of the Diffusion-List for
   any forwarded messages.  Hence, a PCE SHOULD avoid forwarding the
   same message repeated to the same set of peers.  Finally, when an
   address is loose, the forwarding SHOULD be restrained indicating what
   type of PCEP peers are targeted (i.e.  PCE and/or PCC).

5.4.3.  Rules Applied to Existing Errors and Notifications

   Many existing normative references states on error definitions (see
   for instance [RFC5440], [RFC5441],[RFC5455], [RFC5521], [RFC5557],
   [RFC5886], [RFC6006], [RFC8231], [RFC8232],[RFC8253], [RFC8281],
   [RFC8306], [RFC8408], [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group]).  This
   section provides processing rules for existing error types handling,
   as a recommendation.  According to the definitions provided in this
   document, the follwoing rules are applicable:

      Error-type 1, described in [RFC5440], relates to PCEP session
      establishement failures.  All errors of this type are local and
      not propagated.  Hence, if a "Propagation" TLV is added to the
      error message it is recommended to be set to value 0.  Error-
      values 1,2,6,7 have a high level of criticality.  Hence, if the
      "Error-criticality" TLV is included within a PCErr message of type
      1 and value 1,2,6 or 7, it is recommended to have a value of 2.

      Error-type 2,3,4, "Capability not supported", "Unknown object" and
      "Not supported object" respectively, described in [RFC5440]:
      errors of this type MAY be propagated using the TLV "Propagation".
      Their level of criticality is defined as leading to cancel the
      path computation request [RFC5440].  Hence, if the "Error-
      criticality" TLV is included, it usually have a value of 1.  The
      error-value 4 of error-type 4 ("Unsupported parameter") associated
      to the BRPC procedure [RFC5441] is suggested to contain the
      "Propagation" TLV with a DIFFUSION-LIST requesting a propagation
      to the PCC at the origin of the request.

      Error-type 5 refers to "Policy violation", error values for this
      type have been defined in [RFC5440], [RFC5541], [RFC5557],
      [RFC5886] and [RFC6006].  In [RFC5440], it is specified that the
      path computation request MUST be cancelled when an error of type 5
      occurs.  Hence, if the "Error-criticality" TLV is included, it
      usually have a value of 1.  As such errors might be conveyed to
      several PCEs, the "Propagation" TLV MAY be used.

Internet-Draft   Extensions to PCEP for Enhanced errors    February 2019


      Error-type 6 described as "Mandatory object missing" in [RFC5440],
      leads to the cancellation of the path computation request.  Hence,
      if the "Error-criticality" TLV is included, it usually have a
      value of 1.  The "Propagation" TLV MAY be used with such errors.
      The error-value of 4 for Monitoring object missing defined in
      [RFC5886] is no exception to the rule.

      Error-type 7 is described as "synchronized path computation
      request missing".  In [RFC5440], it is specified that the reffered
      synchronized path computation request MUST be cancelled when an
      error of type 5 occurs.  Hence, if the "Error-criticality" TLV is
      included, it usually have a value of 1.  The "Propagation" TLV MAY
      be used with such errors.

      Error-type 8 is raised when a PCE receives a PCRep with an unknown
      request reference.  If the "Propagation" TLV is used with error-
      type 8, it is recommended to be set at a value of 0.  The "Error-
      criticality" TLV is not particularly relevant for error-type 8.
      Hence, it usually have the value of 0 if used.

      Error-type 9 is raised when a PCE attempts to establish a second
      PCEP session.  The existing session must be preserved.  Hence, if
      the "Error-criticality" TLV is included, it usually have a value
      of 0.  By definition, such an error message SHOULD NOT be
      propagated.  Thus, if the "Propagation" TLV is used with error-
      type 9, it is usually set to a value of 0.

      Error-type 10 which refers to the reception of an invalid object
      as described in [RFC5440] no indication is provided on the
      cancellation of the path computation request.  Hence, if the
      "Error-criticality" TLV is included, it usually have a value of 0.
      The "Propagation" TLV MAY be used with such errors with any value
      depending on the expected behavior.

      Error-type 11 relates to "Unrecognized EXRS subobject" and is
      described in [RFC5521].  No path computation request cancellation
      is required by [RFC5521].  Hence, if the "Error-criticality" TLV
      is included, it usually have a value of 0.  The "Propagation" TLV
      MAY be used with such errors with any value depending on the
      expected behavior.

      Error-type 12 refers to "Diffserv-aware TE error" and is described
      in [RFC5455].  Such errors are raised when the CLASSTYPE object of
      a PCReq is recognized but not supported by a PCE.  [RFC5455] does
      not state about the path computation request when such errors are
      met.  Hence, both "Propagation" and "Error-criticality" TLVs COULD
      be used within such error-types' messages and set to any specified
      values.

Internet-Draft   Extensions to PCEP for Enhanced errors    February 2019


      Error-type 13 on "BRPC procedure completion failure" is described
      in [RFC5441].  [RFC5441] states that in such cases, the PCErr
      message MUST be relayed to the PCC.  Hence, such messages SHOULD
      contain a "Propagation" TLV and a DIFFUSION-LIST with a Target-
      Type of 0 and corresponding adresses or with a Target-Type of 2.
      It is not specified in [RFC5441] whether the path computation
      request should be canceled or not.  If the procedure is not
      supported, it does not necessarily imply to cancel the path
      computation request if another procedure is able to read and write
      VSPT objects.  Thus, the "Error-criticality" TLV MAY be used with
      any value depending on the expected behavior.

      Error-type 15 refers to "Global Concurrent Optimization Error"
      defined in [RFC5557].  [RFC5557] states that the corresponding
      global concurrent path optimization MUST be cancelled at the PCC.
      Hence, if the "Error-criticality" TLV is included, it usually have
      a value of 1.  The "Propagation" TLV MAY be used with such errors.

      Error-type 16 relates to "P2MP Capability Error" defined in
      [RFC6006].  Such errors lead to the cancellation of the path
      computation request.  Hence, if the "Error-criticality" TLV is
      included, it usually have a value of 1.  The "Propagation" TLV MAY
      be used with such errors.

      Error-type 17, titled "P2MP END-POINTS Error" is defined
      [RFC6006].  Such errors are thrown when a PCE tries to add or
      prune nodes to or from a P2MP Tree.  [RFC6006] does not specify if
      such errors lead to cancel the path computation request.  Hence,
      the "Error-criticality" and "Propagation" TLVs MAY be used with
      this type of error with any value depending on the expected
      behavior.

      Error-type 18 of "P2MP Fragmentation Error" is described [RFC6006]
      which does not specify whether the path computation request should
      be cancelled.  But, as messages are fragmented, it is natural to
      think that the PCE should wait at least a bit for further
      messages.  The "Error-criticality" TLV MAY be included in such
      error messages and is particularly adapted to differ the semantic
      of the same error-type message: if it is included with a value of
      0 then the PCE will still wait for further fragmented messages,
      when this waiting time ends, the TLV can be included with a value
      of 1 in order to finally cancel the request.  The "Propagation"
      TLV MAY also be used with such errors.

      Error-type 19 of "Invalid Operation" is described in [RFC8231] and
      [RFC8281], which implies a wrong capability description for PCEP
      session.  In this case, the PCErr message MUST be returned to PCC,
      and this message usually contain a "Propagation" TLV and a

      DIFFUSION-LIST with a Target-Type of 0 or 2.  The "Error-
      criticality" TLV is recommended be set to 2 in order to guanrantee
      the termination of PCEP session.

      Error-type 20 of "LSP State Synchronization Error" is described in
      [RFC8231] and [RFC8232], which cannot successfully sync up the LSP
      states.  In this case, the "Error-criticality" TLV should be set
      to 2 in order to guanrantee the termination of PCEP session.  The
      "Propagation" TLV MAY also be used with such errors.

      Error-type 21 of "Invalid traffic engineering path setup type" is
      described in [RFC8408] . Such errors failed to find a matched path
      setup type and the PCEP sessions MUST be closed.  In this case,
      the "Error-criticality" TLV is usually set to 2 in order to
      guanrantee the termination of PCEP session.  The "Propagation" TLV
      MAY also be used with such errors.

      Error-type 23 of "Bad parameter value" is described in [RFC8281] .
      Such errors occur when there is a conflict in path name of C flag
      not set for PCE initiation.  In this case, the "Error-criticality"
      TLV may be set to either 0 or 1 to indicate whether the request is
      still valid, with the PCEP session open.  The "Propagation" TLV
      MAY also be used with such errors.

      Error-type 24 of "LSP instantiation error" is described in
      [RFC8281] . Such errors occur when PCC detects problems when
      establishing the path, the message MUST relay to the PCE,
      therefore the "Propogation" TLV is usually contained.  The "Error-
      criticality" TLV may be set to either 0 or 1 to indicate whether
      the request is still valid, with the PCEP session open.

      Error-type 25 of "PCEP StartTLS failure" is described in
      [RFC8253].  Such errors indicate the security issue in transport
      layer.  In this case, the "Error-criticality" TLV is usually set
      to 2 in order to close the PCEP session.  The "Propagation" TLV
      MAY also be used with such errors, depending on the detailed
      security conditions.

      Error-type 26 of "Association Error " is described in
      [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] . Such errors occur when there is
      problem for LSP association.  In this case, the "Error-
      criticality" TLV should be set to either 0 or 1 to indicate
      whether the request is still valid, with the PCEP session open.
      The "Propagation" TLV MAY also be used with such errors.

6.  Future Extension Consideration

   The procedures specified in this work applies to all the existing
   error types.  For future PCE protocol extension who gives new error
   types, it is requested to provide description on the applicability of
   "Propagation" TLV and "Error-criticality" TLV.

7.  Backward Compatibility Consideration

   There would be backward compatibility issue if there are multiple
   PCEs with different level understanding of error message.  In a
   scenario that PCE(i) propagate the error message to PCE (i+1), it is
   possible that PCE (i+1) is not capable to extract the message
   correctly, then such error message would be ignored and not be
   further propagated.

   There can be potential approach to avoid these problem, such as
   recognizing the incapable PCE and avoiding propagation.  However,
   these approach is not in the scope of this document.

8.  Error and Notification Scenarios

   [Editor Note] This section will be moved to appendix for publication.

   This section provides some examples depicting how the error described
   above can be used in a PCEP session.  The origin of the errors or
   notifications is only illustrative and has no normative purpose.
   Sometimes the PCE features behind may be implementation-specific
   (e.g. detection of flooding).  This section does not provide
   scenarios for errors with a high-level of critcity (i.e., Error
   behaviors 3 and 6) since such errors are very specific and until now
   have been normalized only during the session establishment (error-
   type of 1).

8.1.  Error Behavior Type 1

   In this example, a PCC attempts to establish a second PCEP session
   with the same PCE for another request.  Consequently the PCE sends
   back an error message with error-type 9.  This error stays local and
   does not affect the former session.  The second session is ignored.
   If the "Propagation" TLV and "Error-criticality" TLV are used, they
   should be both set to value 0.

8.2.  Error Behavior Type 2

   In this example, the PCC sends a DiffServ-aware path computation
   request.  If the PCE receiving the request does not support the
   indicated class-type, it thus sends back a PCErr message with error-
   type=12 and error-value=1.  If the "Propagation" TLV and "Error-
   criticality" TLV are present, they should carry value 0 and value 1
   respectively.  Consequently, the request is cancelled.

8.3.  Error Behavior Type 4

   In this example, a PCC sends a path computation requests with no P
   flag set (e.g.  END-POINT object with P-flag cleared).  This is
   detected by another PCE in the sequence.  The path computation
   request can thus be treated but the P-Flag will be ignored.  Hence,
   this error is not critical but the source PCC should be informed of
   this fact.  So, a PCErr message with error-type 10 ("Reception of an
   invalid object").  The PCEP-ERROR object of the message contains a
   "Propagation" TLV at value 1 and a "Error-criticality" TLV at value
   0.  It is hence propagated backwardly to the source PCC.

8.4.  Error Behavior Type 5

   In this example, PCEs are using the BRPC procedure to treat a path
   computation request [RFC5441].  However, one of the PCEs does not
   support a parameter of the request.  Hence, a PCErr message with
   error-type 4 and error-value 4 is sent by this PCE and has to be
   forwarded to the source PCC.  The PCEP-ERROR object includes a
   "Propagation" TLV at value 1 and "Error-criticality" TLV at value 1
   and the message is propagated backwardly to the source PCC.
   Consequently, the request is cancelled.

9.  Security Considerations

   Within the introduced set of TLVs, the "Propagation" TLV affects PCEP
   security considerations since it forces propagation behaviors.  Thus,
   a PCEP implementation SHOULD activate stateful mechanism when
   receiving PCEP-ERROR or NOTIFICATION object including this TLV in
   order to avoid DoS attacks.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains a registry of PCEP parameters.  This includes a sub-
   registry for PCEP Objects.

   IANA is requested to make an allocation from the sub-registry as
   follows.  The values here are suggested for use by IANA.

10.1.  PCEP TLV Type Indicators

   As described in Section 5.4 the newly defined TLVs allows a PCE to
   enforce specific error and notification behaviors within PCEP-ERROR
   and NOTIFICATION objects.  IANA is requested to make the following
   allocations from the "PCEP TLV Type Indicators" sub-registry.


    Value              Description                 Reference
     TBD               Propagation                this document
