  Abstract  
      
     This document defines the "doi" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) 
     scheme for the Digital Object Identifier (DOI). DOIs are 
     identifiers for entities of significance to the intellectual 
     property communities. The "doi" URI scheme allows a resource for 
     an entity identified by a DOI to be referenced by a URI for 
     Internet applications.  A "doi" URI is dereferenced to a set of 
     network services through an appropriate resolution system. The 
     binding between the "doi" URI and the resource which it references 
     is managed and is persistent over time.

  1  Introduction  
          
     This document defines the "doi" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) 
     scheme for the Digital Object Identifier (DOI). DOIs are 
     identifiers for entities of significance to the intellectual 
     property communities. The "doi" URI scheme allows a resource for 
     an entity identified by a DOI to be referenced by a URI for 
     Internet applications.  A "doi" URI is dereferenced to a set of 
     network services through an appropriate resolution system. The 
     binding between the "doi" URI and the resource which it references 
     is managed and is persistent over time. 
      
     The term "Digital Object Identifier" should be construed as 
     meaning an identifier ("Identifier") of an entity ("Object") for 
     use in networked environments ("Digital"). In this sense an 
     "Object" can be any entity - any digital or physical manifestation 
     or  performance, or any abstract work - that is identified by a 
     DOI.  
      
     Some concepts relevant to DOI follow:

     In this document the key words "must", "must not", "required", 
     "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not", "recommended", 
     "may", and "optional" are to be interpreted as described in 
     RFC2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for compliant 
     implementations. 
   
  3  The "doi" URI Scheme 
          
  3.1 Definition of "doi" URI Syntax  
          
     The "doi" URI syntax defined in this document conforms to the 
     generic URI syntax as specified in RFC 2396 [2] and follows the 
     "opaque_part" production rule. The complete BNF for a "doi" URI 
     using the grammar of RFC 822 [3] as amended by RFC 2396, section 
     1.6, is as follows: 
      
       doi_uri         = scheme ":" doi_identifier  
       scheme          = "doi"  
       doi_identifier  = prefix "/" suffix  
       prefix          = *uric_no_slash 
       suffix          = *uric  
      
     where the following productions are taken directly from RFC 2396: 
      
       uric_no_slash = unreserved | escaped | ";" | "?" | ":" | "@" | 
                       "&" | "=" | "+" | "$" | "," 
        
       uric          = reserved | unreserved | escaped 
        
       reserved      = ";" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" | 
                       "$" | "," 
       unreserved    = alphanum | mark  
       mark          = "-" | "_" | "." | "!" | "~" | "*" | "'" | 
                       "(" | ")" 
       escaped       = "%" hex hex   
       hex           = digit | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | 
                       "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" 
      
       alphanum      = alpha | digit 
       alpha         = lowalpha | upalpha 
      
       lowalpha = "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" |

                  "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | 
                  "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z"

                  "8" | "9" 
      
     A "doi" URI has a DOI as its scheme-specific part. A DOI is 
     constructed by appending a unique suffix string to an assigned 
     prefix string separated by a slash "/" character. The prefix is 
     always assigned to a DOI Prefix Holder by a DOI Registration 
     Agency. The DOI Prefix Holder is responsible for the creation of a 
     valid suffix. The prefix in a DOI corresponds to the naming 
     authority. The administration of any particular DOI may be 
     transferred to another party at any time. The prefix does not 
     denote the owner of a DOI. 
      
     ANSI/NISO Z39.84-2000 [4] is the authoritative reference that 
     specifies the rules for constructing a DOI. Once constructed, a 
     DOI should be regarded as an opaque identifier with no internal 
     structure. The minimum constraints for validation of a DOI string 
     are that the prefix and suffix components be non-empty. 
      
  3.2 Allowed Characters Under the "doi" URI Scheme 
      
     The syntax for a DOI is defined in accordance with the ANSI/NISO 
     Z39.84-2000 standard "Syntax for the Digital Object Identifier 
     Syntax". A DOI is represented using the Unicode [5] character set 
     and is encoded in UTF-8 [6]. 
      
     The "doi" URI syntax uses the same set of allowed US-ASCII 
     characters as specified in RFC 2396 for a generic URI. No special 
     characters are reserved, although certain US-ASCII characters are 
     excluded from all URIs.  
      
     Excluded US-ASCII characters and non-US-ASCII characters must be 
     escaped before forming the URI. Details of the escape encoding can 
     be found in RFC 2396, section 2.4. 
          
  3.3 Examples of "doi" URIs 
          
     Some examples of syntactically valid "doi" URIs are given below: 
        
       (a) doi:alpha-beta/182.342-24 
        
     where "alpha-beta" is the prefix and "182.342-24" is the suffix.

       (b) doi:10.abc/ab-cd-ef 
        
     where "10.abc" is the prefix and "ab-cd-ef" is the suffix.  
        
       (c) <rdf:Description about="doi:10.23/2002/january/21/4690"/> 
        
     where "10.23" is the prefix and "2002/january/21/4690" is the 
     suffix. 
      
       (d) doi:11.a.7/0363-0277(19950315)120%3A5%3C%3E1.0.TX%3B2-V 
        
     where "11.a.7" is the prefix and "0363-
     0277(19950315)120%3A5%3C%3E1.0.TX%3B2-V" is the prefix. Note that 
     in unescaped form this DOI is represented in UTF-8 as 
     "11.a.7/0363-0277(19950315)120:5<>1.0.TX;2-V".  
   
  4  Lexical Equivalence for the "doi" URI Scheme 
      
     The DOI is a case-insensitive identifier. As it is often desirable 
     to determine if two "doi" URIs are the same without resolving them 
     a general purpose means of doing so is by testing for "lexical 
     equivalence" as defined below. 
      
     Two "doi" URIs are lexically equivalent if they are octet-by-octet 
     equal after the following preprocessing: 
      
         1. Normalize the case of the leading "doi:" token to be      
            lowercase 
         2. Normalize the case of the scheme-specific part 
            including any %-escaped characters to be lowercase 
      
     Note that %-escaped characters must not be removed. 
      
  5  Examples of Lexical Equivalence for the "doi" URI Scheme 
      
     The following comparisons highlight the lexical equivalence 
     definitions for "doi" URIs: 
      
         1. doi:10.abc/ab-cd-ef 
         2. doi:10.ABC/ab-cd-ef 
         3. doi:10.ABC/AB-cd-ef 
         4. doi:10.ABC/AB-CD-ef 
         5. doi:10.ABC/AB-CD-EF 
      
     All the above "doi" URIs are lexically equivalent.

     The International DOI Foundation (IDF) is a not-for-profit 
     membership-based organization founded to develop a framework of 
     infrastructure, policies and procedures to support the 
     identification needs of the intellectual property communities. 
     The IDF is the maintenance agency for DOI and appoints DOI 
     Registration Agencies. 
      
     DOIs are created by DOI Prefix Holders and must be registered via 
     a DOI Registration Agency. Any network user can become a DOI 
     Prefix Holder by agreement with a DOI Registration Agency. 
      
     Registration Agencies perform the following functions: allocating 
     DOI prefixes, registering DOIs, and providing the necessary 
     infrastructure to allow DOI Prefix Holders to declare and maintain 
     the metadata associated with a particular DOI. DOI Registration 
     Agencies also maintain knowledge of the current owner of each 
     individual DOI to ensure legal administrative updates. 
      
  7  DOI Resolution 
      
     A "doi" URI is dereferenced to one or more network services. This 
     dereference process is known as "resolution" of the DOI. Examples 
     of network services that can be accessed on resolution of the DOI 
     include redirection to another network resource, return of a 
     metadata record describing the entity identifed by the DOI, etc. 
      
     Resolution of a DOI is accomplished through an appropriate 
     resolution service using a network protocol specific to that 
     service. 
   
  8  Rationale 
      
  8.1 Why Create a New URI Scheme for DOI? 
      
     Under RFC 2718, "Guidelines for new URL Schemes" [7], it is stated 
     that a URI scheme should have a "demonstrated utility", and in 
     particular should be applied to "things that cannot be referred to 
     in any other way". DOI meets both of these criteria in that it is 
     a well established identifier (see <http://www.doi.org/>) for 
     entities of significance to the intellectual property communities, 
     with some 10 million examples in current use on the Internet, and 
     is being widely embraced by the content industries. DOI is not 
     bound to an Internet protocol and so requires its own dedicated 
     URI scheme.  
   
  8.2 Why Not Use an Existing URI Scheme for DOI? 
      

   
   
  Paskin                 Expires - November 2003               [Page 6] 
                           The "doi" URI Scheme                 May 2003 
   
   
     The administration granularity of existing URI schemes typically 
     operates at the authority component level. By contrast DOIs are 
     managed at the individual identifier level. It is for this reason 
     that the DOI prefix is not to be interpreted as an "owner" 
     authority but rather as the "creator" authority. Once created the 
     DOI should be regarded as an opaque identifier with no internal 
     structure. For this reason a "doi" URI has no relative URI forms. 
      
  8.3 Why Not Use a URN Namespace ID for DOI? 
   
     RFC 2396 states that a "URN differs from a URL in that it's [sic] 
     primary purpose is persistent labeling of a resource with an 
     identifier". A DOI on the other hand has a dual purpose: both to 
     provide for the persistent identification of an entity of 
     significance to the intellectual property communities, as well as 
     to enable access to a set of network services. In this regard a 
     "doi" URI scheme should be considered as being similar to the 
     "tel", "fax" and "modem" URI schemes documented in RFC 2806 [8]. 
      
  9  Security Considerations 
          
     The "doi" URI scheme is subject to the same security 
     considerations as the general URI scheme described in RFC 2396. 
      
     Dereference of a "doi" URI to access network services will be 
     subject to the security considerations of the underlying protocol 
     used to access the resource referenced by the "doi" URI.
