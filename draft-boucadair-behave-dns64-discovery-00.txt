Internet-Draft           DNS64 Service Discovery            October 2009


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overall Context

   Recently, due to IPv4 address depletion, several solutions have been
   proposed within IETF.  Among those solutions, IPv6 is the only
   perennial solution that should be implemented by service providers.
   Nevertheless, this implementation won't be in one shot and the co-
   existence between IPv4 and IPv6 should be managed for a while.  In
   addition to the co-existence issue, interconnection means to enable
   successful communications between IPv4 and IPv6 realms must be
   enforced.

   In this context, BEHAVE WG is currently specifying translator
   mechanisms which cover both stateful
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful] and stateless
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] modes.  The proposed solutions require
   the definition of a new IPv4-mapped IPv6 address
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] which is used to represent an IPv4-
   only host in an IPv6 realms and the definition of a new mechanism
   called DNS64 for synthesizing a AAAA record, representing an IPv4-
   mapped IPv6 address in the DNS system, from the A record representing
   the IPv4 address of the IPv4-only host [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64].

   This IPv4-mapped IPv6 address, when managed by a translator, is to be
   considered as "fake" address in a DNS system since it is not
   necessarily assigned to any host's interface qualified by the
   associated name.  In fact, the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address represents
   the IPv6 interface of the translator used to translate packet
   exchanged with the IPv4 host.

   Moreover, it can be confusing for applications since the application
   querying for this address must be aware that the application running
   on the host represented by the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address is connected
   through an IPv4 interface and may be not able to use a reference
   [I-D.carpenter-behave-referral-object] to an IPv6 address in the
   packet payload.

   When an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address is used as destination address, the
   traffic will be handled by a translator device and no direct
   communication would be possible.

1.2.  Technical Issues

   This memo discusses issues that may be encountered when deploying
   DNS64 mechanism in operational networks.  Particularly, In order to
   avoid crossing NAT64 boxes, natives communications should be
   encouraged.  Therefore, an IPv6 host should be able to prefer a



Boucadair & Burgey       Expires April 22, 2010                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           DNS64 Service Discovery            October 2009


   native destination IPv6 address to reach a remote peer instead of any
   IPv4-mapped IPv6 address synthesised through the DNS64 mechanism.

   Furthermore, a dual-stack host should be able to prefer the native
   IPv4 address instead of any IPv4-mapped IPv6 address but should be
   able to prefer the native IPv6 address instead of any IPv4 one.
   Consequently, the activation of the DNS64 mechanism must be avoided
   for dual-stack hosts if they are not able to distinguish native AAAA
   records from synthesised AAAA records.

   A solution to distinguish native AAAA records from synthesised AAAA
   records is proposed in [I-D.boucadair-behave-dns-a64].  This proposal
   introduces a new A64 DNS Record Type for synthesised AAAA records.
   But, as this new record type will not be "understood" by existing
   implementations, it is necessary, during a transition phase, to
   return, to non-updated IPv6 applications or non updated IPv6 DNS stub
   resolvers, AAAA records for synthesised AAAA records.

   Therefore the original DNS64 mechanism is updated as follows:

   o  Rely on DNS64 mechanism as described in [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64].
      When supported, a DNS server returns AAAA records for native IPv6
      addresses records and IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.  This mechanism
      may be used during the transition phase.

   o  Introduce A64-capable DNS which returns AAAA records for native
      IPv6 addresses and A64 records for IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.

1.3.  Contribution of this Draft

   This document focuses on the following issues:

   o  Discovery of a compliant DNS server which is able to generate
      synthesised AAAA records [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64].

   o  Ability to distinguish native AAAA records from synthesised AAAA
      records.


2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms.

   o  Authoritative server: A DNS server that can answer authoritatively
      for a given DNS query.

   o  Stub resolver: A resolver with minimum functionality, typically
      for use in end points that depends on a recursive resolver.  Most

Internet-Draft           DNS64 Service Discovery            October 2009


      end points on the Internet use stub resolvers.

   o  Recursive resolver: A DNS server that accepts requests from one
      resolver, and asks another resolver for the answer on behalf of
      the first resolver.

   o  AAAA_DNS function: A logical function that synthesizes AAAA
      records (containing IPv6 addresses) from A64 records if there is
      no AAAA native records and generate also AAAA records from A
      records(containing IPv4 addresses) if there is no AAAA native
      records and no A64 records for the requested domain name.

   o  A64_DNS function: A logical function that returns A64 records or
      synthesizes A64 records (containing IPv6 addresses) from A records
      (containing IPv4 addresses).

   o  AAAA_DNS server: A DNS server which supports AAAA_DNS function.

   o  A64_DNS server: A DNS server which supports A64_DNS function.

   o  A64_DNS recursor: A recursive resolver that provides the A64_DNS
      function as part of its operation.

   o  Synthetic RR: A DNS resource record (RR) that is not contained in
      any zone data file, but has been synthesized from other RRs.  An
      example is a synthetic AAAA record created from an A record.

   o  DNS64 service: Denotes the service offered by a DNS server which
      is supporting AAAA_DNS or A64_DNS functions.

   o  A DNS server that includes neither AAAA_DNS nor A64_DNS function
      and is not able to manage A64 records is called a "DNS64
      uncompliant DNS server".


3.  Discovery of DNS64 Service

3.1.  DNS-based Approach: DNS64 SRV RR

3.1.1.  Rationale

   This section proposes to define a new SRV RR [RFC2782] for the
   location of DNS64 service.  DNS64 service is unambiguously
   distinguished from native AAAA-capable DNS servers.  DNS64 service
   should not be invoked for the resolution of native AAAA records.  A
   decision-making process may be enforced in the client side to drive
   the invocation of DNS64 service or native IPv6 DNS server
   appropriately.  Otherwise, the traffic which may go through the



Boucadair & Burgey       Expires April 22, 2010                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           DNS64 Service Discovery            October 2009


   translators is not optimised and extra-processing would be required.

   The DNS64 service can also be defined using S-NAPTR [RFC3958] or
   U-NAPTR [RFC4848].

3.1.2.  DNS64 SRV RR Definition

   The format of the generic SRV RR defined in [RFC2782] is as follows:

       _Service._Proto.Name TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port Target

   Within this memo, only the description of "Service" and "Target" are
   re-produced below.  For more information about the description of the
   fields, the reader is invited to refer to [RFC2782].

   o  Service: The symbolic name of the desired service.  For the DNS64
      service, "DNS64" is proposed as a service name for the location of
      DNS64 service.  If the proposal is adopted, a formal service name
      is to be assigned by IANA.  When used in an SRV RR, the assigned
      service name must be prepended with an "_" character.

   o  Target: The domain name of the target host.  There must be one or
      more address records for this name.  A Target of "." means that
      the service is decidedly not available at this domain.

   In order to retrieve a the IP address of a DNS server supporting the
   DNS64 service, the client should be SRV-capable and should be
   configured to issue a dedicated SRV query.  The result of the
   corresponding query should be used to retrieve the synthesised IPv6
   addresses representing IPv4 hosts.

   A host should be provided with DNS servers which support AAAA records
   and servers which support DNS64 service.  In order to avoid invoking
   NAT64 boxes, a client should be configured in order to prefer
   requesting native IPv6 DNS servers first.  If not result has been
   retrieved, DNS64 can be then invoked.

   This sequential approach may increase the required delay for the
   establishment of a communication.  Several solutions (out o scope of
   this document) can be envisaged such as:

   1.  Issue simultaneous queries;

   2.  Define a new record type/query type to identify an IPv4-mapped
       IPv6 address from a native IPv6 one;

   3.  Define a new query type to retrieve all existing records.

Internet-Draft           DNS64 Service Discovery            October 2009


3.1.3.  Example Usage

   A client is provisioned with the QNAME to be used for the resolution
   of DNS64 service.

   If a client wants to discover a DNS server that provides DNS64
   service for the domain MyInternetAccessDomain.com., it does a lookup
   of _DNS64._udp.MyInternetAccessDomain.com.

3.2.  DHCP-based Approach

   DHCPv6 can be used to provision the IP address(es) of DNS server(s)
   which are capable to provide DNS64 service.  A new option is required
   for this purpose.

   The format of the proposed DHCPv6 Option is shown in the figure
   hereafter:

        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

       |                                                               |
       |                 Address(es) of DNS Server (s)               |

   Below is provided the description of the fields:

   o  Type: OPTION_DNS64.  To be assigned by IANA for DNS64 service.

   o  option-length: variable

   o  Address(es) of DNS Server (s): One or a list of IP addresses of
      DNS server(s) supporting the DNS64 service.

   o  valid-lifetime: The valid lifetime for the address(es) enclosed in
      the option, expressed in units of seconds.

3.3.  RA-based Approach

   This section describes a RA-based solution which is similar to the
   one described in [RFC5006] for the discovery of RRDNS servers.

   This option is used to convey the IPv6 address of the DNS server (s)
   supporting the DNS64 service.

   Below is provided the description of the fields:

   o  Type: OPTION_DNS64.  To be assigned by IANA for DNS64 service.

      the option, expressed in units of seconds.

4.  On the Location of A64_DNS and AAAA_DNS Functions

   AAAA_DNS function should be located in a stub resolver or may be
   located in the first recursive resolver after the stub resolver.

   AAAA_DNS function should not be activated in a stub resolver located
   on a dual-stack host with access to public IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
   An exception to this rule may happen to manage communication between
   IPv6-only application on dual-stack host and IPv4-only application,
   but such case may not be common.

   AAAA_DNS function should not be activated in a resolver called by a



Boucadair & Burgey       Expires April 22, 2010                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft           DNS64 Service Discovery            October 2009


   stub resolver located on a dual-stack host with access to public IPv4
   and IPv6 networks.  AAAA_DNS function must not be activated on an
   authoritative server.

   A64 records, may be used on authoritative DNS servers, but only if
   the IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses stored in this record has a global
   scope.  In that case this records may be introduced in the server
   with standard provisioning tools, but in some cases it may be
   preferable to provision only the A records and to use an A64_DNS
   function to generate the corresponding A64 records.

   More generally, an A64_DNS function should be located in a recursive
   DNS resolver chosen so that, for all IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses
   stored in A64 records generated by this A64_DNS function, the
   translator interface represented by this IPv6 address is the best
   suitable to translate packets exchanged between any of the hosts
   using a stub resolver sending requests to this DNS resolver and the
   IPv4 interface represented by the IPv4 address mapped in this IPv6
   address.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests the use of "_DNS64" service label.  This service
   is associated only with UDP transport.


6.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in [RFC2782] should be taken into
   account.
