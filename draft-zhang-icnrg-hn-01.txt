    Abstract 

       This document defines a hybrid naming scheme for unifying all kinds 
       of information including resources, services and data. As many 
       proposals of novel network architectures emerge, such as DONA, ICN,
       NDN, the location-based routing starts to transfer to the content-based
       ones. Currently, it is incompatible that many different information
       naming schemes are adopted in  different network proposals,
       respectively, i.e. flat names in DONA, hierarchical names in NDN. The 
       proposed naming scheme adopts a hybrid naming structure including 
       hierarchical component, flat component and attribute component. The 
       hybrid naming (hn) scheme enables to identify different routing 
       information uniformly, and provides great compatibility and advantages.

    1. Introduction 

    1.1. Hierarchical naming 

       Some emerging network architectures (i.e. Content-Centric Network 
       (CCN)[1]/Named Data Networking (NDN)[2]) have proposed a readable 
       naming mechanism based on the hierarchical structure. This 
       hierarchical name is very similar as identifying a web with a URL, 
       for example "/www.bupt.edu.cn/content/a.avi". In this example, "/" is 
       the separator between adjacent components of the name.  

       We acknowledge that there are some advantages in this naming scheme. 
       First, it has a good compatibility with current applications or 
       systems based on URL, which can reduce the difficulty of deploying 
       the novel network. Second, it has a good aggregation to reduce the 
       number of routing information, and improve lookup efficiency of 
       routing information. Besides, its lookup mechanism has a good 
       compatibility with the existing classless inter-domain routing 
       (CIDR)[3]. 

       However, the hierarchical name also has some fatal disadvantages. It 
       consists of a series of unlimited components. The number of 
       components is variable, and the length of each component is not 
       restricted. All these features cause the length of names is variable 
       and relatively long [4]. In this way, the routing table and 
       forwarding table may be very huge, which results in the lookup 
       efficiency becomes very low.  

       In addition, when users search for a resource, they might not 
       remember the long name of the resource. For example, users need the 
       resource a.avi, but they might not know the official name 
       "/www.bupt.edu.cn/content/a.avi" or "/www.bupt.edu.cn/movie/a.avi". 
       Hierarchical naming structure is difficult to support a fuzzy 
       matching based on the attributes of names. 

    1.2. Flat naming 

       The flat naming mechanism has been used in other novel network 
       architectures, such as DONA [5] and NetInf [6]. This flat name can be 
       produced by cryptographic hashing of the content itself or its 
       attributes.  

       Due to the flat name has not any structure restriction, it can be 
       obtained and used more flexibly. Any string with a fix length, no 
       matter whether it is unreadable or readable, can be used as a flat 
       name.  

     
     
    Zhang, et al.          Expires April 8, 2015                [Page 4] 
        
    Internet-Draft  Uniform information with a hn scheme     October 2014 
        

       However, the flat name has a low degree of aggregation, which will 
       increase the number of the routing entries and reduce the 
       expandability of routing table. Besides, most of flat names are not 
       readable, which increase the probability of users' forgetting the 
       official names of the desired information. When users want to obtain 
       contents, it needs a mapping between readable names and unreadable 
       names for users by means of an additional mapping system.  

    1.3. Attribute naming 

       The naming mechanism based on attributes of content is used in the 
       CBCB [7]. It enumerates the attribute information of a resource, such 
       as the category, format, date, feature, level and so on. This name is 
       non-uniqueness which is different from the former two mechanisms. The 
       related content can be searched and located by means of the key 
       properties of resource.  

       The advantage of this naming is that it supports searching key words 
       and provides benefits for the fuzzy matching for searching resources. 
       However, there may be many similar properties for a set of certain 
       resources. The uniqueness is hardly guaranteed by a limited number of 
       attributes. Thus, to guarantee the uniqueness, the attributes stored 
       in routing system will be very huge. 

        

    2. Conventions used in this document 

       The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
       "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
       document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].  

       In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation   
       only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be    
       interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance. 

       In this document, the characters ">>" preceding an indented line(s)   
       indicates a compliance requirement statement using the key words    
       listed above. This convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying   
       or finding the explicit compliance requirements of this RFC. 

        

    3. Novel hybrid naming (hn) format 

       According to the analysis of above three kinds of naming mechanisms 
       in terms of advantages and disadvantages, a hybrid naming is 
     
     
    Zhang, et al.          Expires April 8, 2015                [Page 5] 
        
    Internet-Draft  Uniform information with a hn scheme     October 2014 
        

       suggested to highlight the advantages of them and weaken their 
       disadvantages.  

       Most importantly, three mainstream different naming schemes are 
       adopted in different novel network architectures, which make the 
       networks be hardly compatible and implemented complexly.  

       One easy and all-benefit solution is the integrated method for them, 
       taking each of them as a part of the hybrid naming solution. In other 
       words, each of them takes some weight of the novel naming scheme. 

        

       We proposed a hybrid naming mechanism (named by "hn"), which 
       organizes three kinds of naming mechanisms in a sequence, and builds 
       a more powerful and universal naming format. 

       The hybrid naming format should include three components: 

       o Hierarchical component 

       o Flat component 

       o Attribute component 

        

       Each part carries different information of name in different formats, 
       which produce an entire name. The hybrid name is started by a symbol 
       "hn://". The order of three parts should be as follows: 

       1. The first part of a name is very important for the aggregation of 
          routing entries. A hierarchical structure is adopted in the first 
          part. The symbol "/" is used to split the hierarchical levels in 
          this part. 

       2. The second part of a name is very important to identify the 
          content uniquely. A flat structure is used in the second part. A 
          string with a fix length can be used by a hash computing. 

       3. The third part of a name is used to represent the extensive 
          information of resources. The attribute-based structure is 
          selected in the third part, which is composed of a set of 
          attribute words.

    3.1. Hierarchical component generating 

       Hierarchical component is the first part of the hn naming format. 
       This part is suggested to be generated following a reference standard 
       to be followed. This standard should define the string set in top 
       level, string set in second level and so on. This reference standard 
       is very useful to promote its aggregation greatly. One available but 
       not complete reference standard for naming hierarchical component is 
       the naming scheme of DNS. 

        

    3.2. Flat component generating 

       Flat component is the second part of hn naming scheme. This part is 
       suggested to identify the information using a string with a limited 
       length. This part must identify the information uniquely by combing 
       with the first part.  

       Flat component can be generated by cryptographic hash algorithm by 
       the information itself or some characters of the information. This 
       part has a low probability of aggregation, but it highlights and 
       ensures the uniqueness of name. 

        

    3.3. Attribute component generating 

       Attribute component is placed as the third part of hn naming scheme. 
       This part will take charge of the fuzzy matching and some advanced 

     
     
    Zhang, et al.          Expires April 8, 2015                [Page 7] 
        
    Internet-Draft  Uniform information with a hn scheme     October 2014 
        

       search, i.e., QoS guarantee. This part will also contribute to 
       conduct some potential advanced application based on the useful 
       attributes. It can be generated by extracting the features of the 
       information, such as the format, issue time, file size, catalog, 
       location, popularity, privacy level and so on. 

        

    4. Advantages 

    4.1. High aggregation 

       The aggregation of names is very important for the name lookup and 
       storage. According to Google's report, the number of URLs it indexed 
       was 26 million in 1998, which reached to one billion in 2000, and is 
       currently 1 trillion [8]. In July 2011, these URLs could be 
       aggregated to about 280 million domain names, among which 86 million 
       are active.  

       It is a fact that there is a great aggregation for the first few 
       levels of the hierarchical tree. Therefore, the hierarchical 
       structure is used in the first part of the hn. By this way, the 
       routing entries can be reduced obviously and the aggregation of route 
       can be improved. For example, there are two routing entries 
       "/www.bjtu.edu.cn/m/movie/fhk562nfgjru056:kongfu:avi:1024p:part1 3" 
       and "/www.bjtu.edu.cn/m/picture/fh84rnf213gjrru:jpg:300*500:prairie 
       3" which have the same forwarding port "3" and prefix 
       "/www.bjtu.edu.cn/m". Therefore, the forwarding port and 
       "/www.bjtu.edu.cn/m" can only be stored in routing table. It not only 
       reduces the entries of routing table, but also reduces the length of 
       each routing entries. An example of aggregation process is shown in 
       Figure 3.

    4.2. Limited length 

       The length of name based on hierarchical structure is variable and 
       relatively long because it must be formed by several parts and the 
       number of component is variable. Kelvin [9] has selected 6627999 URL 
       in 78764 different domain names, and the statistics shows that the 
       average length of URL is 76.97 bytes. In the architecture of ICN, the 
       name must be extracted to query in forwarding table or routing table 
       and a long name entry will lead to the query speed becoming low, 
       hance, affects the performance of routing.  

        

       The hn naming scheme use a part of flat component in the name to ease 
       this problem. A fix length flat part is embedded behind the 
       hierarchical part. This design not only can restrict the length of 
       names not too long, but also will affect the aggregation not much. 
       For example, if the average length of hierarchical part is controlled 
       within 30 bytes, adopting a flat part with a fix length of 20 bytes, 
       the whole average length will be restricted within 50 bytes. 
       Comparing to 76.97 bytes, the length is shortened by nearly 35%, 
       which will improve the query speed of name greatly using the length-
       dependent algorithms. 

        

    4.3. Suffix holes remission 

       The suffix hole is a well-known problem for the route of prefix 
       matching. For example, a routing entry "/www.bjtu.edu.cn/movie/3" is 
       stored in the route table for prefix matching. In fact, it is 
       aggregated by "/www.bjtu.edu.cn/movie/a.avi/part1 3"and 
       "/www.bjtu.edu.cn/movie/b.avi/part1 3". In this way, the forwarding 
       packets will be forward from port 3, only if the prefix of name is 
       "/www.bjtu.edu.cn/movie/". However, if packets with a name of 
       "/www.bjtu.edu.cn/movie/c.avi" arrive in the router, it will be 
       forwarded from port 3. Actually, the network that port 3 connects 
       only has a.avi and b.avi. This causes the so-called suffix holes [10].  

       In the proposed hn scheme, the flat part can solve the problem of 
       suffix holes efficiently. For example, there are two resource names 
       "/www.bjtu.edu.cn/movie/s83hho90oxn2783nde4r:kongfu:avi:1024p:part1 
       3" and

    Internet-Draft  Uniform information with a hn scheme     October 2014 
        

       "/www.bjtu.edu.cn/movie/ 3". The routing entry will be matched when 
       an packet whose name is "/www.bjtu.edu.cn/movie/a932jfdjf2032942-
       jdd:control:avi:1024p:part1:part2" arrives at this router.  

        

       However, it can not be forwarded from the port 3 based on hn scheme 
       due to the incomplete prefix matching. There is a suffix list in each 
       aggregating prefix, and the packet will be forwarded only when the 
       requesting suffix exists in the suffix list. In hn scheme, it must 
       assort a suffix list for each routing entries like 
       "/www.bjtu.edu.cn/movie/ 3" to store the flat parts of names. 
       Although the name of new packet has been matched to the routing 
       entries, its flat part "a932jfdjf2032942-jdd" does not exist in the 
       suffix list "/www.bjtu.edu.cn/movie/ 3". The plat part will be used 
       to confirm whether it forward the request packet when the prefix is 
       matched. By this way, the problem of suffix holes can be resolved 
       effectively. The lookup process of hn names is shown in Figure 4.

    4.4. Fuzzy matching support 

       In the practical, one important situation is that the users may not 
       know the full official resource name when they search a resource. The 
       hn naming scheme support the fuzzy matching thanks to the function of 
       the attribute component. For example, the users need the resource 
       a.avi, they need not know the official name 
       "hn://www.bjtu.edu.cn/m/|u584uuj89324ru|kongfu:movie:avi:1024p:part1". 
       In this case, users only publish the information of video "kongfu" 
       and the resolution ratio is "1024p", the related resources can be 
       found intelligently by fuzzy matching based on the attribute 
       component matching. This is the benefit about embedding attribute of 
       resource in the end of name. 

    4.5. Good compatibility 

       This naming scheme provides a good compatibility for all three 
       mainstream naming schemes, which are the subset of the hn naming 
       scheme. 

    5. Transition from IPv4 and IPv6 

    5.1. Case one 

       In TCP/IP networks, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are used to represent the 
       resource locations. Combing with the port information and content 
       directory, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can also be used to fetch the 
       desired information uniquely. We consider the hybrid naming scheme 
       transiting from IPv4 and IPv6 networks. 

       The IPv4 or IPv6 address is the hierarchical as the first part of the 
       hybrid name. The port number is flat as the second part of the hybrid 
       name. The content directory is a set as the third part of the hybrid 
       name. An illustration of transition from IPv4 and IPv6 is shown in 
       Figure 5.

    5.2. Case two

       Another case of transition from URL is shown in Figure 6. For example,
       the url is "http://www.baidu.com:80/s?wd=icbc&rsv_bp=0&tn=baidu  
       &spt=3&ie=utf8", in which the symbol "?" is followed by a sequence of
       attributes information. The hn format is shown as follows.

       +------------------+-----+---------------------------------------+---+ 
       |hn://www.baidu.com|80/s?|wd:icbc rsvbp:0 tn:baidu spt:3 ie:utf8 | 3 | 
       +------------------+-----+---------------------------------------+---+

    6. Formal Syntax 

       The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur 
       Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [RFC2234]. 

        

    7. Security Considerations 

       The proposed hn naming scheme has potential benefits for the security. 
       The hierarchical prefix has a high aggregation, which can avoid the 
       security issues of rapid expansion in routing or forwarding table, 
       such as DoS attack. The flat component can protect the users' privacy 
       and the content secrets from readable names. The attributes component 
       can improve the management for the secure contents by using of some 
       encryption key. 

    8. Conclusions 

       This document defines a novel hybrid naming scheme for unifying all 
       kinds of information (including resources, services and data). This
       hybrid naming scheme owns many advantages, which can provide a good
       compatibility for existing naming schemes.
