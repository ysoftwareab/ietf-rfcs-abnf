Internet-Draft           MPLS-TP ring protection          September 2009


Abstract

   according to MPLS-TP Requirement draft, there are two requirements :
   requirement 56.B Recovery techniques used for P2P and P2MP should be
   identical to simplify implementation and operation.another require as
   section 2.5.6.1 describles: within the context of recovery in MPLS-TP
   networks,the optimization criteria considered in ring topologies are
   as follows: 1 minimize the number of OAM entities that are needed to
   trigger the recovery operation; 2 Minimize the number of elements of
   recovery in the ring; 3 Minimize the number of labels required for
   the protection paths across the ring; 4 minimize the amount of
   control and management plane transactions during a maintenance
   operation. this decument will describle and provide two types of ring
   protection solutions. both solutions can satisfy these requirements
   of recovery in mpls-tp ring network.

1.  Introduction

   this draft mainly introduce two new ring protection solutions,
   solution 1 is based on MPLS FRR-bypass solution to realize to protect
   all kind of service(eg.  P2P or p2mp) when there are a few fault or
   detects in the ring at the same time. while solution 2 is based on
   G.8132 Steering protection solution to be able to realize to protect
   P2P or P2MP services very rapidly. at last it provide the comparsion
   of the two ring protection solutions from the view of a protection
   performance.

3.  proposed ring protection solution

   this section mainly proposed two kinds of ring protection
   solution.the two ring protection solutions can need to detect and
   notify the failure of the ring by MPLS or MPLS-TP OAM functions,so
   that the source node or the local failure node will switch these
   relative services to protection path.but the two ring protection
   solutions also have a few differences. solution 1 provide protection
   of all failure services by setting up protection tunnel,while the
   later ring protection solution provide one dedicate protection path
   for each working LSP path to protect and recovery all failure
   services in the ring.

3.1.  Solution 1

   The ring protection solution in MPLS-TP network mainly make use of
   protection tunnel to protect all failure services.firstly a prime
   node will be choosed in the ring. at the same time. in order to
   continue to protect all failure services when the prime node have a
   failure, a secondary node will be choosed to be backup node for the
   prime node in the ring. and other node in the ring need to pre-
   configured and set up a bidirectional protection tunnel to the prime
   node and the secondary node; and there is BFD function packet to
   detect link or node failure between two directly interconnection node
   in the ring.

   when a node of the ring detects a failure include link failure or
   peer node failure, it will generate a failure notify message to send
   to prime node and secondary node of the ring by pre-configured
   protection tunnel. and the frame format of the failure notify message
   is as the following:


       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | 0001|  0000 |      00000000    |     channel type         |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                    ACH TLV Header                         |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                    LSP identifier  TLV                     |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                                 Figure 1


   NOTE:

   LSP Identifier TLV: a standard TLV frame construct. including Type ,

   Length,and Value, and the value field may be divided into two parts:
   the former is the identifier of LSP path, the later is Entry Label of
   the LSP path in the ring. this LSP Identifier TLV format is as the
   following:



       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |   TYPE   |    Length    |   LSP Identifier   |  Entry label|
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                                 Figure 2


   NOTE:

   LSP Identifier: it identify solely LSP path in the ring, eg: TTSI;

   Entry Label: Local Entry Label of the LSP Path in the node .

   when the prime node of the ring received the failure notify message
   packet from two end nodes that have detected the failure. the prime
   node will bind the relation of the two protection tunnel .so the
   failure notify messages that have received from a protection tunnel
   can continue to transport by another protection tunnel. at last the
   failure notify message will be transported to another upstream node.
   and the upstream node receives the failure notify message packet and
   analysises the message packet. if the failure notify message has no
   any LSP Identifier TLV or NULL TLV, all working LSP services in the
   upstream node are still transported by working label. or else it will
   look up label swithing table by LSP Identifier in LSP Identifier TLV.
   if there exist a few working services that need to switch into
   protection path.  Entry Label in LSP Identifier TLV will replace of
   the export label for the same LSP Identifier. when a normal service
   packet reachs the node, the node will change switch label into entry
   label of LSP Identifier TLV ,Then the service packet will be
   transported by protection tunnel between the node and the prime node
   in the ring. when the prime node receives the service packet from the
   upstream node.the service packet will continue to be tranported in
   another protection tunnel that has already been bound by switching
   label of protection tunnel layer. at last the service packet will be
   transported to the downstream node and continue to be transported in
   original working LSP like wrapping solution.

   the implement in detail as the following figure :

                                 Figure 3


   if there is a service from node B to node F , under the normal
   condition,the service will be transported by B-C-D-E-F working path.
   when there is a failure individually in link (C-D) and link(D-E),
   firstly C,D,E node will detect the failure by BFD function and the
   three node will generate a failure notify message individually and
   send the failure notify message packet to the prime node A and the
   secondary node F by their own specail protection tunnels.as the D
   node have already been a isolate point , its failure notify message
   will not be transported to the prime node by its own protection
   tunnel. only the failure notify message from C,E node will be
   transported to the prime node A individually through C-A and E-A
   protection tunnel.when prime node A receives failure notify message
   from C and E node protection tunnel. it will bind the two protection
   tunnels and the failure notify message packet from C will be sent to
   E node. at the same time. the failure notify message packet from E
   node will be sent to C node. and for the service from B to F , C will
   be upstream node to E node. when C node receive the failure notify
   message from E , It will look up its own switching table by LSP
   Identifier in the LSP Identifier TLV. we suppose that entry label is
   1 and export label is 2 at the C node for the service from B to F ,
   while entry label is 100 and out label is 200 at the E node for the

   service and the service LSP Identifer is 300 under normal condition.
   when a failure have happened ,C node will look for which LSP
   Identifier is 300. if it find the LSP service. and the service will
   be transported by protection path and entry label in E node will
   replace of export label in C node for the service from B to F node.
   then the service packets in C node will be transported to the prime
   node A by C to A protection tunnel path. then by switching protection
   tunnel, the service packets will be transported to E by A-E
   protection tunnel.at last the serivce packets will be tranported by
   switching originate working LSP path and to destination node F.

   when the nodes detect no failure in the ring.  They will send a free-
   failure notify message packet to the prime node A and the secondary
   node F through their own protection tunnel.and the prime node A
   receives the free-failure notify message packet and sends to its
   upstream node , so the upstream node will make all service pakcets be
   transported by originate working LSP path.

3.2.  Solution 2

   This ring protection solution can extend G.8132 Steering protection
   solution to simply , quickly and effectively protect all service
   include p2p or p2mp in the MPLS-TP ring. in order to protect and
   restore all failure services when a failure has happened in the ring.
   firstly each LSP service should configure one working LSP path and
   one protecting LSP path in the ring. and the direction of the two LSP
   path is reverse in the ring. when a failure has been detected by BFD
   function, a failure notify message packet will be generated and sent
   to other nodes in the ring by control channel or other channel. when
   other nodes receive the failure notify message packet, they firstly
   make their source services bridge to the working path and the
   protecting path and double send the service to its destination node
   in the directions of working path and protecting path. if a node in
   the ring is destination node for a service.  It will select a
   direction of path to receive service packet. each sink node will
   detect whether the direction of receive service packet is changable.
   if it happens, the sink node will return the message of receiving
   state change to its source node for a LSP service. when the source
   node for a LSP service receives all messages from other sink nodes
   and analysis. if all sink nodes receive service packets in the same
   direction include working path or protecting path. the source node of
   the service will select a path(working path or protecting path) to
   send service packet. or else it will continue to send service packet
   in the two path(working path and protecting path). after a period of
   time, when a node detects the failure is clear, the node will
   generate a free-failure notify message and send to all other nodes in
   the ring. all other nodes receive the free-failure notify message and
   stop sending double their service pakcets ,all service packets will

   only be transported in the direction of working path. at the same
   time , each sink node for a service will select the direction of
   working path to receive service packet as normal condition.

   If there is a P2MP service from source node B to sink node 1 E and
   sink node 2 F in the above ring.under normal situation,the service
   pakcet will be transported by working path B-C-D-[E]-[F]; when link
   C-D and link D-E failure happens, node C or node E that detects a
   failure will generate a failure notify message packet to send to
   other node in the ring through control channel or other channel. when
   other node C(E),B,A,F receive the failure notify message packet, they
   will make all source services bridge to working LSP path and
   protecting LSP path firstly. eg. the service from B to E,F , node B
   firstly send doule packet separately along its working path B-C-D-E-F
   and its protecting path B-A-[F]-[E].  As there are the failure in C-D
   link and D-E link, service sink node E ,F will not receive service
   packets by its working path B-C-D-E-F. so the two sink nodes must
   receive the service packet by its protectiong path B-A-[F]-[E].at the

   same time. the sink node E, F have changed the direction of receiving
   service packet ,so the node E,F will generate the message of
   receiving state change and send to service source node B. so source
   node B will receive the message and anylisis the message. because
   both sink nodes receive service from their protecting path. so the
   source node will only select protecting path to send its service
   packet as the following figure:

   when the failure is clear up, the node C,E detect the failure state
   have changed, the node C ,E will generate a free-failure notify
   message and send to all other nodes in the ring. when other nodes
   receive the free-failure notify message , each node will send and
   receive its own service only in the working path .eg,the p2mp service
   from B to E,F will return to working path B-C-D-[E]-[F] to send and
   receive its own service packet as the following.

3.3.   Comparison

   The two ring protection solutions can fulfil MPLS-TP requirement of
   ring recovery. but there are different protection and recovery
   mechanism and different character, the detail is the following table:
