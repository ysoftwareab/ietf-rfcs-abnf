   o  VNFPOOL: Virtual Network Function Resource Pooling

2.  Virtual Network Function Resource Pooling

   Virtualised Network Function (VNF) (e.g. vFW, vLB) -- as introduced
   in more detail in [12] -- provides the same function as the
   equivalent network function (e.g. FW, LB), but is deployed as
   software instances running on general purpose servers via
   virtualisation platform.  The main features of VNF include the
   following aspects:

   1.  A service consists of a sequence of topologically distributed VNF
       instances where the data connections are preferably directly
       established between the instances.

   2.  There are potentially more factors that cause VNF instance
       transition or even failure; VNF pool refers to a group of VNF
       instances providing same network function.

   Virtualisation technology allows network function virtualisation
   operators to build a reliable VNF by pooling the underlying
   resources, such as CPU, storage, networking, etc. to form a cluster
   of VNF instances.  VNF pool refers to a cluster or group of VNF
   instances providing same network function.  Each VNF pool has a Pool
   Manager (PM) to manage the VNF instance such as instance selection,
   monitoring, etc.  There will be a redundancy mechanism for a reliable
   PM to achieve reliable VNF.  More details on VNF pool can be found in
   [12].

                                 Figure 1

   An overview of the RSerPool framework -- which is defined as RFC in
   [2] -- is provided in Figure 1.  There are three types of components:

   o  Pool Element (PE) denotes a server in a pool.  PEs in the same
      pool provide the same service.

   o  Pool User (PU) denotes a client using the service of a pool.

   o  Pool Registrar (PR) is the management component for the pools.

   The set of all pools within an operation scope (for example: an
   organisation, a company or a department) is denoted as handlespace.
   Clearly, a single PR would be a single point of failure.  Therefore,
   PRs also have to be redundant.  Within the handlespace, each pool is
   identified by a unique pool handle (PH).

3.2.  Registrar Operations

   The PRs of an operation scope synchronise their view of the
   handlespace by using the Endpoint haNdlespace Redundancy
   Protocol (ENRP, defined as RFCs in [4], [5]).  In contrast to for
   instance the Domain Name System (DNS), an operation scope is
   restricted to a single administrative domain.  That is, all of its
   components are under the control of the same authority (for example:
   a company).  This property leads to small management overhead, which
   also allows for RSerPool usage on devices having only limited memory



Dreibholz, et al.       Expires February 21, 2017               [Page 4]

   and CPU resources (for example: telecommunications equipment).
   Nevertheless, PEs may be distributed globally to continue their
   service even in case of localised disasters (like for example an
   earthquake).  Each PR in the operation scope is identified by a PR
   ID, which is a randomly chosen 32-bit number.

3.3.  Pool Element Operations

   Within their operation scope, the PEs may choose an arbitrary PR to
   register into a pool by using the Aggregate Server Access
   Protocol (ASAP, defined as RFCs in [3], [5]).  The registration is
   performed by using an ASAP_REGISTRATION message.  Within its pool, a
   PE is characterised by its PE ID, which is a randomly chosen 32-bit
   number.  Upon registration at a PR, the chosen PR becomes the Home-
   PR (PR-H) of the newly registered PE.  A PR-H is responsible for
   monitoring the availability of its PEs by ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE
   messages (to be acknowledged by a PE via an
   ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE_ACK message within a configured timeout).
   The PR-H propagates the information about its PEs to the other PRs of
   the operation scope via ENRP_UPDATE messages.

   PEs re-register regularly in an interval denoted as registration
   lifetime and for information updates.  Similar to the registration, a
   re-registration is performed by using another ASAP_REGISTRATION
   message.  PEs may intentionally deregister from the pool by using an
   ASAP_DEREGISTRATION message.  Also like for the registration, the
   PR-H makes the deregistration known to the other PRs within the
   operation scope by using an ENRP_UPDATE message.

3.4.  Takeover Procedure

   As soon as a PE detects the failure of its PR-H (that is: its request
   is not answered within a given timeout), it simply tries another PR
   of the operation scope for its registration and deregistration
   requests.  However, as a double safeguard, the remaining PRs also
   negotiate a takeover of the PEs managed by a dead PR.  This ensures
   that each PE again gets a working PR-H as soon as possible.  The PRs
   of an operation scope monitor the availability of each other PR by
   using ENRP_PRESENCE messages, which are transmitted regularly.  If
   there is no ENRP_PRESENCE within a given timeout, the peer is assumed
   to be dead and a so-called takeover procedure (see also [21] for more
   details) is initiated for the PEs managed by the dead PR: from all
   PRs having started this takeover procedure, the PR with the highest
   PR ID takes over the ownership of these PEs.  The PEs are informed
   about being taken over by their new PR-H via an
   ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE with Home-flag set.  The PEs are requested
   to adopt the sender of this Home-flagged message as their new PR-H.

3.5.  Pool User Operations

3.5.1.  Handle Resolution and Response

   In order to access the service of a pool given by its PH, a PU
   requests a PE selection from an arbitrary PR of the operation scope,
   again by using ASAP.  This selection procedure is denoted as handle
   resolution.  Upon reception of a so-called ASAP_HANDLE_RESOLUTION
   message the PR selects the requested list of PE identities and
   returns them in an ASAP_HANDLE_RESOLUTION_RESPONSE message.

3.5.2.  Pool Member Selection Policies

   The pool-specific selection rule is denoted as pool member selection
   policy or shortly as pool policy.  Two classes of load distribution
   policies are supported: non-adaptive and adaptive strategies (a
   detailed overview is provided by [16], [18], [23], [19]).  While
   adaptive strategies base their selections on the current PE state
   (which requires up-to-date information), non-adaptive algorithms do
   not need such data.  A basic set of adaptive and non-adaptive pool
   policies is defined as RFC in [7].

   Defined in [7] are the non-adaptive policies Round Robin (RR),
   Random (RAND) and Priority (PRIO) as well as the adaptive policies
   Least Used (LU) and Least Used with Degradation (LUD).  While RR/RAND
   select PEs in turn/randomly, PRIO selects one of the PEs having the
   highest priority.  PRIO can for example be used to realise a master/
   backup PE setup.  Only if there are no master PEs left, a backup PE
   is selected.  Round-robin selection is applied among PEs having the
   same priority.  LU selects the least-used PE, according to up-to-date
   application-specific load information.  Round robin selection is
   applied among multiple least-loaded PEs.  LUD, which is evaluated by
   [20], furthermore introduces a load decrement constant that is added
   to the actual load each time a PE is selected.  It is used to
   compensate inaccurate load states due to delayed updates.  An update
   resets the load to the actual load value.

3.5.3.  Handle Resolution and Response

   PE may fail, for example due to hardware or network failures.  Since
   there is a certain latency between the actual failure of a PE and the
   removal of its entry from the handlespace -- depending on the
   interval and timeout for the ASAP_ENDPOINT_KEEP_ALIVE monitoring --
   the PUs may report unreachable PEs to a PR by using an
   ASAP_ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE message.  A PR locally counts these reports
   for each PE and when reaching the threshold MAX-BAD-PE-REPORT
   (default is 3, as defined in the RFC [3]), the PR may decide to
   remove the PE from the handlespace.  The counter of a PE is reset

   upon its re-registration.  More details on this threshold and
   guidelines for its configuration can be found in [22].

3.6.  Automatic Configuration

   RSerPool components need to know the PRs of their operation scope.
   While it is of course possible to configure a list of PRs into each
   component, RSerPool also provides an auto-configuration feature: PRs
   may send so-called announces, that is, ASAP_ANNOUNCE and
   ENRP_PRESENCE messages which are regularly sent over UDP via IP
   multicast.  Unlike broadcasts, multicast messages can also be
   transported over routers (at least, this is easily possible within
   LANs).  The announces of the PRs can be heard by the other
   components, which can maintain a list of currently available PRs.
   That is, RSerPool components are usually just turned on and
   everything works automatically.

3.7.  State Synchronisation

   RSerPool has been explicitly designed to be application-independent.
   Therefore, RSerPool has not intended to define special state
   synchronisation mechanisms for RSerPool-based applications.  Such
   state synchronisation mechanisms are considered as tasks of the
   applications themselves.  However, RSerPool defines two mechanisms to
   at least support the implementation of more sophisticated strategies:
   Cookies and Businesss Cards.  Details on these mechanisms can also be
   found in Subsection 3.9.5 of [16].

3.7.1.  Cookies

   ASAP provides the mechanism of Client-Based State Sharing as
   introduced in [17].  Whenever useful, the PE may package its state in
   form of a state cookie and send it -- by an ASAP_COOKIE message -- to
   the PU.  The PU stores the latest state cookie received from the PE.
   Upon PE failure, this stored cookie is sent in an ASAP_COOKIE_ECHO to
   the newly chosen PE.  This PE may then restore the state.  A shared
   secret known by all PEs of a pool may be used to protect the state
   from being manipulated or read by the PU.

   While Client-Based State Sharing is very simple, it may be
   inefficient when the state changes too frequently, is too large (the
   size limit of an ASAP_COOKIE/ASAP_COOKIE_ECHO is 64 KiB) or if it
   must be prevented that a PU sends a state cookie to multiple PEs in
   order to duplicate its sessions.

3.7.2.  Businesss Cards

   Depending on the application, there may be constraints restricting
   the set of PEs usable for failover.  The ASAP_BUSINESS_CARD message
   is used to inform peer components about such constraints.

   The first case to use a Business Card is if only a restricted set of
   PEs in the pool may be used for failover.  For example, in a large
   pool, each PE can share its complete set of session states with a few
   other PEs only.  This keeps the system scalable.  That is, a PE in a
   pool of n servers does not have to synchronise all session states
   with the other n-1 PEs.  In this case, a PE has to tell its PU the
   set of PE identities being candidates for a failover using an
   ASAP_BUSINESS_CARD message.  A PE may update the list of possible
   failover candidates at any time by sending another Business Card.
   The PU has to store the latest list of failover candidates.  Of
   course, if a failover becomes necessary, the PU has to select from
   this list using the appropriate pool policy -- instead of performing
   the regular PE selection by handle resolution at a PR.  Therefore,
   some literature also denotes the Business Card by the more expressive
   term "last will".

   In symmetric scenarios, where a PU is also a PE of another pool, the
   PU has to tell this fact to its PE.  This is realised by sending an
   ASAP_BUSINESS_CARD message to the PE, providing the PH of its pool.
   Optionally, also specific PE identities for failover may be provided.
   The format remains the same as explained in the previous paragraph.
   If the PE detects a failure of its PU, the PE may -- now in the role
   of a PU -- use the provided PH for a handle resolution to find a new
   PE or use the provided PE identities to select one.  After that, it
   can perform a failover to that PE.

3.8.  Protocol Stack

   The protocol stack of a PR provides ENRP and ASAP services to PRs and
   PEs/PUs respectively.  But between PU and PE, ASAP provides a Session
   Layer protocol in the OSI model.  From the perspective of the
   Application Layer, the PU side establishes a session with a pool.
   ASAP takes care of selecting a PE of the pool, initiating and
   maintaining the underlying transport connection and triggering a
   failover procedure when the PE becomes unavailable.

   The Transport Layer protocol is by default SCTP (as defined in [1])
   -- except for the UDP-based automatic configuration announces (see
   Section 3.6) -- over possibly multi-homed IPv4 and/or IPv6.  SCTP has
   been chosen due to its support of multi-homing and its reliability
   features (see also [26]).

3.9.  Extensions

   A couple of extensions to RSerPool are existing: Handle Resolution
   Option defined in [9] improves the PE selection by letting the PU
   tell the PR its required number of PEs to be selected.  ENRP Takeover
   Suggestion introduced in [11] ensures load balancing among PRs. [10]
   defines a delay-sensitive pool policy. [8] defines an SNMP MIB for
   RSerPool.

3.10.  Reference Implementation and Deployment

   RSPLIB is the Open Source reference implementation of RSerPool.  It
   is currently -- as of February 2016 -- available for Linux, FreeBSD,
   MacOS and Solaris.  It is actively maintained.  Particularly, it is
   also included in Ubuntu Linux as well as in the FreeBSD ports
   collection.  RSPLIB can be downloaded from [14].  Further details on
   the implementation are available in [16], [24].

   RSerPool with RSPLIB is deployed in a couple of Open Source projects,
   including the SimProcTC Simulation Processing Tool-Chain for
   distributing simulation runs in a compute pool (see [25] as well as
   the simulation run distribution project explained in [26] for a
   practical example) as well as for service infrastructure management
   in the NorNet Core research testbed (see [27], [28]).

4.  Usage of Reliable Server Pooling

   **** TO BE DISCUSSED! ****

   The following features of RSerPool can be used for VNFPOOL:

   o  Pool management.

   o  PE seclection with pool policies.

   o  Session management with help of ASAP_BUSINESS_CARD.

   The following features have to be added to RSerPool itself:

   o  Support of TCP including MPTCP as additional/alternative transport
      protocols.

   o  Possibly add some special pool policies?

   o  See also [13] for ideas on a next generation of RSerPool.

   The following features have to be provided outside of RSerPool:

Internet-Draft            RSerPool for VNFPOOL               August 2016


   o  State synchronisation for VNFPOOL.

   o  Pool Manager functionality as an RSerPool-based service.

5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for RSerPool can be found in [6].
   Furthermore, [23] examines the robustness of RSerPool systems against
   attacks.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces no additional considerations for IANA.

7.  Testbed Platform

   A large-scale and realistic Internet testbed platform with support
   for Reliable Server Pooling and the underlying SCTP protocol is
   NorNet.  A description of and introduction to NorNet is provided in
   [28], [29], [30].  Further information can be found on the project
   website [15] at https://www.nntb.no.
