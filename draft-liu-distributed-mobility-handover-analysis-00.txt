1.  Introduction

   With the Gateway in the cellular telecom core network moving
   downwards towards the access network and being deployed
   distributively, the number of gateways is increasing.  Consequently,
   an increasing the percentage of handovers will be of inter-gateway
   handovers among all the handovers is also rising.  Due to the fixed
   anchor point used by the current mobility management, the route in
   the access network is not optimized, ; that means there is roundabout
   in the access network.  Such roundabout problems will aggravate with
   the increase of inter-gateway handovers.

3.  Inter-GW Handover Frequentness Analysis

   We use a real deployment case in a metro of China as an example for
   the analysis.  There are seventeen RNC nodes covering the metro.  If
   we presume the Gateways are moved downwards to the level of RNC, we
   can calculate the frequentness of inter-GW handover based on that of
   inter-RNC handover.

   The frequentness of inter-RNC handover:

   In certain time period of j, relocNj is the total numbers of inter-
   RNC handover: I relocNj = SUM(CS relocation number i + PS relocation
   number i) i=1

   In certain time period of j, rabNj is the total number of PDP
   activation and call establishment in RNCs: I rabNj = SUM(CS call
   number i + PS call number i) i=1

   Rj is the frequentness of handover in this time period: Rj = relocNj
   / rabNj

   R is the mean handover frequentness in all the time periods: J R =
   (SUM Rj)/ J *100% j=1

   Notes:

   1) The CS calls and PS calls are counted based on the successful RAB
   establishment

   2) Both CS relocation and PS relocation include types of UE involved
   and UE not involved for handover out

   3) I is the number of RNC in the metro

   4) J is the number of time period, which could be one hour or more.

   The statistics shows that the mean frequentness of inter-RNC handover
   in one hour is 12.32%, that is there are 12 times inter-RNC handover
   per 100 times of CS calls or PS PDP activation.  The highest handover
   frequentness could reach 15.97%.  If the gateways are moved to the
   level of RNC, then the frequentness of inter-GW handover should be
   equivalent to that of inter-RNC.

3.1.  The Trend of the Inter-GW Handover Frequentness

   The statistics result above is based on the current deployed network.
   With the evolution of the mobile network, e.g. when the LTE is
   deployed, we can expect that inter-GW handover frequentness will
   increase, when comparied with current deployed network.

   a.  With the increment of the traffic and the user amount, the
   requirement of the bandwidth goes up consequently.  To meet this
   requirement, the density of the basestation shall increase.
   Meanwhile, with the consideration of the limited capacity and
   capability of the GWs, the density of the GWs should also increase.
   So, in a same coverage area, there will be more GWs.  As a result,
   the inter-GW handover frequentness will increase.

   b.  With the service evolution, the rate of the always online user
   will increase.  Accordingly, the rate of the service which is started
   (e.g.  PDP activation) and completed (e.g.  PDP inactivation) under a
   same GW will drop.  As a result, the inter-GW handover frequentness
   will increase.

   We expect that in the near future, the value of the inter-GW handover
   frequentness may be doubled or even tripled to the value of current
   frequentness.


4.  The impact of non-optimized Routing

   When fixed anchor point is used, the problems of roundabout will
   worsen with the movement of the user.  Especially, when service is
   deployed far from the anchor point and near the location where the
   user is moving to.  When the anchor point locates at a different
   city, the impacts of roundabout become more serious, that will
   inevitably affect the customer experience.  In the following

   chapters, the impacts are appraised with a traffic model from the
   aspects of traffic volume, congestion and time delay, etc.

4.1.  Analysis model

   We use the following model for the handover analysis.  In this model,
   the anchor is distributed in the network edge.  The communication
   peer may be located in the backbone or in the metro network.

   When the UE attaches to the network through S-GW2, the forwarding

   For the case that the communication peer is located in backbone, the
   forwarding path is illustrated as the following figure.

   For the case that the peer is located in metro network, the

   Whe the UE moves to S-GW1's serving area and handover to S-GW1 from
   S-GW2, the data forwarding path is illustrated as the following
   figures.  In this scenario, if we use current mobility solution, the
   anchoring point should be still at P-GW2.

   For the case that the peer is located in backbone network, the
   forwarding path is illustrated as following figure.

      Figure 5: Forwarding path when peer is located in metro network

   It is assumed that the traffic to the backbone network is 60% of the
   total traffic and the traffic to metro network is 40% of the total
   traffic.

4.2.  Traffic load Analysis

   Based on the above handover model, the un-optimized routing is
   summaried in the following table.

        Figure 6: Traffic Analysis result for non-optimized routing

   From this analysis result, it can be concluded that the non-optimized
   routing will result in 100% traffic load increase in metro network.

4.3.  Congestion Probability Analysis

   We assume that the congestion probability in metro network is X, the
   congestion probability between metro network and backbone is Y, based
   on the above analysis model, we have the following result.




      +-------------------------------------------------------------+
      |congestion |peer in   |             |                        |

      |           |          |             |                        |
      |-----------+----------+-------------+------------------------+
      |After      |          |             |0.6*[1-(1-X)(1-X)*(1-Y)]|
      |handover   |1-(1-X)*  |             |                        |
      |           |(1-X)*(1-Y)|1-(1-X)(1-X)|+0.4*[1-(1-X)*(1-X)]    |
      +-------------------------------------------------------------+




    Figure 7: Congestion Probability Analysis result for non-optimized
                                  routing

   From the above result,we can conclude that the congestion probability
   will increase after handover.  If X=3%, Y=3%, the congestion
   probability after handover will increase 2.86%.

4.4.  Delay Analysis

   The delay from UE to peer consists of three parts:delay within metro
   network: T1, the delay between metro to backbone:T2, the delay within
   backbone:T3.  Based on the above model, we have the following
   analysis result.

         Figure 8: Delay Analysis result for non-optimized routing

   From the analysis result, we can conclude that the delay within metro
   will increase 100% due to the non-optimized routing after handover.


5.  Conclusion

   According to the inter-gateway handover frequentness calculation
   model and based on the data gathered from the deployed network, an
   average of 12% of service sessions perform inter-gateway handover
   (e.g. handover from S-GW2 to S-GW1) in every survey cycle.  The
   inter-gateway handover leads to non-optimal routing and brings some
   impactions as following:

   Traffic load: referring to figure 6, a lot of wasted volume deliveres
   in the metro network.  The operator's valuable bearer resource is
   wasted.  According to the Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast by
   CSISO, in 2015 the global mobile data traffic will be 6.3EB.  That
   means the wasted volume will be 0.75EB in 2015.

   Congestion: Many mobile users will suffer from a higher congestion
   probability than the average.  The increased congestion probability
   is X*(1-X)*(1-0.6X), in which the X is the average congestion
   probability in metro network and the Y is the average congestion
   probability between the metro network and backbone network.  For
   example, when X is 10%, Y is 10%, then the average congestion
   probability is 15.4%.  Then these mobile users have to bear the
   congestion probability of 23.86%.

   Delay: Many users will suffer from much more traffic delay.  The
   increased traffic delay is one time of the average delay in the metro
   network.
