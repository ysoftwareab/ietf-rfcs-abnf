Internet-Draft          Reg Event GRUU Extension              April 2006


1.  Introduction

   The addition of GRUU (Globally Routable Unique URI) support to the
   REGISTER message, defined in [3], introduces another element of state
   to the registrar.  Subscribers to the registration event package [2]
   will sometimes have need for the new state.

   For example, the Welcome Notices example in [2] will only operate
   correctly if the contact address in the reg event notification is
   reachable by the sender of the welcome notice.  When the registering
   device is using the GRUU extension, it is likely that the registered
   contact address will not be globally addressable, and the GRUU should
   be used as the target address for the MESSAGE.

   Another case where this feature may be helpful is within the 3GPP IP
   Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).  IMS employs a technique where a REGISTER
   of a contact address to one Address of Record (AOR) causes the
   implicit registration of the same contact to other associated AORs.
   If a GRUU is requested and obtained as part of the registration
   request, then additional GRUUs will also be needed for the implicit
   registrations.  While assigning the additional GRUUs is
   straightforward, informing the registering UA of them is not.  In
   IMS, UAs typically subscribe to the 'reg' event, and subscriptions to
   the 'reg' event for an AOR result in notifications containing
   registration state for all the associated AORs.  The proposed
   extension provides a way to easily deliver the GRUUs for the
   associated AORs.

   The reg event package has provision for including extension elements
   within the <contact> element.  This document defines a new element
   that may be used in that context to deliver the GRUU corresponding to
   the contact.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. [1]


3.  Description

   A new element (<gruu>) is defined which contains a GRUU.

   This optional element is included within the body of a NOTIFY for the
   "reg" event package when a GRUU is associated with the contact.  The
   contact URI and the GRUU are then both available to the watcher.

4.  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   Unchanged from RFC 3680 [2].


5.  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests

   A notifier for the "reg" event package [2] SHOULD include the <gruu>
   element when a contact has an Instance ID and a GRUU is associated
   with the combination of the AOR and the Instance ID.  When present,
   the <gruu> element MUST be be positioned as an instance of the <any>
   element within the <contact> element.


6.  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   When a subscriber receives a "reg" event notification [2] with a
   <contact> containing a <gruu>, it SHOULD use the GRUU in preference
   to the corresponding <uri> when sending SIP requests to the contact.

   Subscribers that are unaware of this extension will, as required by
   [2], ignore the <gruu> element.


7.  Sample reginfo Document

      Note: This example and others in the following section are
      indented for readability by the addition of a fixed amount of
      whitespace to the beginning of each line.  This whitespace is not
      part of the example.  The conventions of [8] are used to describe
      representation of long message lines.

   The following is an example registration information document
   including the new element:

8.  Examples

   Note: In the following examples the SIP messages have been
   simplified, removing headers that are not pertinent to the example.

8.1.  Example: Welcome Notice

   Consider the Welcome Notices example in [2].  When the application
   server receives a notification of a new registration containing the
   reginfo shown in Section 7 it should address messages using the
   contained GRUU as follows:

      MESSAGE sip:user@example.com;opaque=hha9s8d-999a SIP/2.0
      To: <sip:user@example.com>
      From: "SIPland Notifier" <sip:notifier@example.com>
      Content-Type: text/plain
      Content-Length: ...

      Welcome to SIPland!
      Blah, blah, blah.

Internet-Draft          Reg Event GRUU Extension              April 2006


8.2.  Example: Implicit Registration

   In an 3GPP IMS setting, a UA may send a single register message,
   requesting assignment of a GRUU, as follows:

      REGISTER sip:example.net SIP/2.0
      From: <sip:user_aor_1@example.net>;tag=5ab4
      To: <sip:user_aor_1@example.net>
      Contact: <sip:ua.example.com>
        ;expires=3600
        ;+sip.instance="<urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6>"
      Supported: path, gruu
      Content-Length: 0

   The response reports success of the registration and returns the GRUU
   assigned for the combination of AOR, Instance ID, and Contact.  It
   also indicates (via the P-Associated-URI header [6]) that there are
   two other associated AORs that may have been implicitly registered
   using the same contact.  But each of those implicitly registered AORs
   will have had a unique GRUU assigned, and there is no way defined to
   report that assignment in the response.

      SIP/2.0 200 OK
      From: <sip:user_aor_1@example.net>;tag=5ab4
      To: <sip:user_aor_1@example.net>;tag=373392
      Path: <sip:proxy.example.net;lr>
      Service-Route: <sip:proxy.example.net;lr>
      Contact: <sip:ua.example.com>
        ;expires=3600
        ;+sip.instance="<urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6>"
        ;gruu="sip:user_aor_1@example.net;opaque=hha9s8d-999a"
      P-Associated-URI: <sip:user_aor_2@example.net>,
        <sip:+358504821437@example.net;user=phone>
      Content-Length: 0

   The UA then subscribes to the 'reg' event package as follows:

      SUBSCRIBE sip:user_aor_1@example.net SIP/2.0
      From: <sip:user_aor_1@example.net>;tag=27182
      To: <sip:user_aor_1@example.net>
      Route: <sip:proxy.example.net;lr>
      Event: reg
      Expires: 3600
      Accept: application/reginfo+xml
      Contact: <sip:user_aor_1@example.net;opaque=hha9s8d-999a>
      Content-Length: 0

   (The successful response to the subscription is not shown.)  Once the

   addition to the status for the requested URI, the status for the

   The status indicates that the associated URIs all have the same
   contact registered.  It also includes the unique GRUU that has been
   assigned to each.  The UA may then retain those GRUUs for use when
   establishing dialogs using the corresponding AORs.


9.  XML Schema Definition

   A GRUU document is an XML document that MUST be well-formed and
   SHOULD be valid.  GRUU documents MUST be based on XML 1.0 and MUST be
   encoded using UTF-8.  This specification makes use of XML namespaces
   for identifying GRUU documents.  The namespace URI for elements
   defined for this purpose is a URN, using the namespace identifier
   'ietf'.  This URN is:
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:gruuinfo

10.  IANA Considerations

   There are two IANA considerations associated with this specification.

10.1.  URN Sub-Namespace Registration

   This section registers a new XML namespace, per the guidelines in
   [4].

   URI: The URI for this namespace is urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:gruuinfo

   Registrant Contact: IETF, SIPPING working group, <sipping@ietf.org>,

10.2.  XML Schema Registration

   This section registers an XML schema per the procedures in [4].

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:gruuinfo.

   Registrant Contact: IETF, SIPPING working group, <sipping@ietf.org>,
   Paul Kyzivat <pkyzivat@cisco.com>

   The XML for this schema can be found in Section 9.


11.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for the registration event package is
   discussed in RFC 3680 [2], and those considerations apply here.

   The addition of GRUU information does not impact security negatively
   because the GRUU is less sensitive than the contact URI itself.
