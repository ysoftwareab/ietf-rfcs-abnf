Internet-Draft         message/sip message/sipfrag        September 2001


1. message/sip

   A mime-part of type message/sip can contain a single SIP [1] request
   or response message.

2. message/sipfrag

   A mime-part of type message/sipfrag can contain a subset of a single
   SIP message.  A valid message/sipfrag part is one that could be
   obtained by starting with some valid SIP message and deleting any of
   the following
   o  the entire start line
   o  one or more entire headers
   o  the body
   If the message/sipfrag part contains a body, it must also contain a
   Content-Length header and the null-line separating headers from the
   body.

3. IANA Considerations

   The following is to be registered with IANA

          Media Type name:         message
          Media subtype name:      sip
          Required parameters:     none
          Optional parameters:     version, msgtype
           version: The SIP-Version number of the enclosed message
                    (e.g., "2.0"). If not present, the version can be
                    determined from the first line of the body.
           msgtype: The message type -- "request" or "response". If not
                    present, the type can be determined from the first
                    line of the body.
          Encoding considerations: binary
          Security considerations: See section 4


          Media Type name:         message
          Media subtype name:      sipfrag
          Required parameters:     version
           version: The SIP-Version number of the enclosed message
                    (e.g., "2.0").
          Optional parameters:     none
          Encoding considerations: binary
          Security considerations: See section 4

4. Security Considerations

   A SIP message may contain sensitive information.  If so, it can
   either be protected inside the message using the mechanisms specified
   in [1], or protected using the S/MIME mechanisms in [2].
