1.  Abstract 
    
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the 
   Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) protocol for IPv4 and IPv6. 
    
    
2.  Introduction 
    
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the 
 
                                                                     1

   Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) protocol [1,2,3,4,5].  This MIB 
   module is applicable to IPv4 and IPv6 multicast routers which 
   implement PIM. This MIB extends the MIB proposed in [6]. This MIB 
   does not support management of PIM for other address families. Such 
   management may be supported by other MIBs. 
    
    
3.  The SNMP Network Management Framework 
    
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
   components: 
    
   o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [7]. 
    
   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
   purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of 
   Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in RFC 
   1155 [8], RFC 1212 [9] and RFC 1215 [10]. The second version, called 
   SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578 [11], RFC 2579 [12] and RFC 2580 
   [13]. 
    
   o    Message protocols for transferring management information. The 
   first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
   described in RFC 1157 [14]. A second version of the SNMP message 
   protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is 
   called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [15] and RFC 1906 [16]. The 
   third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described 
   in RFC 1906 [16], RFC 2572 [17] and RFC 2574 [18]. 
    
   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information. The 
   first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
   described in RFC 1157 [14]. A second set of protocol operations and 
   associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [19]. 
    
   o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [20] 
   and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 
   [21]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
    
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A 
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable 
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine 
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of 
   the MIB.

4.  Overview 
    
   This MIB module contains one scalar and eight tables. Some of the 
   objects in these tables are deprecated.  This MIB contains 
   deprecated objects since they are necessary for managing PIMv1 
   routers, but PIMv1 itself is obsoleted by PIMv2 [3,4]. 
    
    
   The tables contained in this MIB are: 
    
    (1)   The PIM Interface Table contains one row for each of the 
   router's PIM interfaces. 
    
    (2)   The PIM Neighbor Table contains one row for each of the 
   router's PIM neighbors. 
    
    (3)   The PIM IP Multicast Route Table contains one row for each 
          multicast routing entry whose incoming interface is running 
   PIM. 
    
    (4)   The PIM Next Hop Table contains one row for each outgoing 
   interface list entry in the multicast routing table whose interface 
   is running PIM, and whose state is pruned. 
    
    (5)   The (deprecated) PIM RP Table contains the PIM (version 1) 
   information for IP multicast groups which is common to all RPs of a 
   group. 
    
    (6)   The PIM RP-Set Table contains the PIM (version 2) information 
   for sets of candidate Rendezvous Points (RPs) for multicast group 
   addresses with particular address prefixes. 
    
    (7)   The PIM Candidate-RP Table contains the multicast groups for 
   which the local router is to advertise itself as a Candidate-RP. If 
   this table is empty, then the local router advertises itself as a 
   Candidate-RP for all groups. 
    
    (8)   The PIM Component Table contains one row for each of the PIM 
   domains to which the router is connected.

   This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information 
   related to multicast routing, including information on the network 
   topology.  There are also a number of objects that have a MAX-ACCESS 
   clause of read-write and/or read-create, which allow an 
   administrator to configure PIM in the router. 
    
   While unauthorized access to the readable objects is relatively 
   innocuous, unauthorized access to the write-able objects could cause 
   a denial of service.  Hence, the support for SET operations in a 
   non-secure environment without proper protection can have a negative 
   effect on network operations. 
    
   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the 
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, 
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to 
   access and SET (change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
    
   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use 
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based 
   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
   entity giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give 
   access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have 
   legitimate rights to access them.
