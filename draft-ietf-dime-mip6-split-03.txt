   Diameter server of the Mobile Service Provider (MSP).  This document
   that specifies the interaction between the Home Agent and the
   Diameter server.  Two different mechanisms for authentication of a MN
   to the HA are supported.  The first method consists of performing the
   Internet Key Exchange v2 (IKEv2) protocol along with the Extensible
   Authentication Protocol (EAP) with the Diameter server, while the
   second method utilizes the Mobile IPv6 Authentication option, as
   defined in RFC 4285.  For Internet Key Exchange v2 with EAP-based
   authentication, the Diameter Mobile IPv6 application, defined in this
   document, reuses the commands defined in the Diameter EAP
   application, while for supporting the RFC 4285-style MIPv6
   Authentication Options, a new Diameter application is defined that
   reuses the Diameter Mobile IPv4 application.

Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6: HA-to-AAAH Support          June 2007


1.  Introduction

   Performing the Mobile IPv6 protocol [1], requires assignment of a
   Home Agent (HA) to a Mobile Node (MN).  The MN needs to register its
   Mobile IPv6 session with the HA in order facilitate its reachability
   and mobility, when away from home.

   From an operator (mobility service provider, MSP) perspective, it is
   important to verify that the MN is authenticated and authorized to
   utilize Mobile IPv6 service and that such services are accounted for.
   Thus, prior to processing the Mobile IPv6 service requests, the HA,
   participates in the authentication of the MN to verify the MN's
   identity.  The HA also participates in the Mobile IPv6 authorization
   process involving the Diameter infrastrucure.  The HA due to its role
   in traffic forwarding, also performs accounting for the Mobile IPv6
   service provided to the MN.

   Mobile IPv6 specifications allow two different methods for MN
   authentication, one based on IKEv2 and EAP [2], and another based on
   the Mobile IPv6 Authentication Option [3].  The goal of this document
   is to specify the Diameter procedures associated with the Mobile IPv6
   bootstrapping between the HA and the Diameter server for these two
   Mobile IP authentication approaches.

   For that reason the Diameter Mobile IPv6 application provides two
   different sets of commands.  The first set of commands reuse the
   command already define in Diameter EAP application (though using the
   Diameter Mobile IPv6 Application-Id).  While the second set of
   commands are new for Diameter and provide support the Mobile IPv6
   Authentication Option, defined in RFC 4285.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].

   The MIPv6 bootstrapping terminology is taken from [5].


3.  Advertising Application Support

   Diameter nodes conforming to this specification MUST advertise
   support by including the Diameter Mobile IPv6 Application ID value of
   [TO BE ASSIGNED BY IANA] in the Auth-Application-Id AVP of the
   Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer
   command [6]

4.  Overview

   One task of the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping procedure is to assign an
   appropriate HA to the MN.  Furthermore, authorization and successful
   delivery of Mobile IPv6 to a MN through a HA, requires the HA to act
   as a client to the Diameter infrastructure interconnecting it to the
   MSP.  As a Diameter client, the HA needs to perform the following
   operations:

   Authentication:  Asserting or helping in assertion of the correctness
      of the MN identity.  As a Diameter client supporting the new
      Diameter Mobile IPv6 application, the HA may need to support two
      different types of authentication by supporting the different
      command sets that are required for each authentication method.

   Authorization:  The HA must verify that the user is authorized to use
      the Mobile IPv6 service using the assistance of the MSP Diameter
      servers.  This is accomplised through use of new Diameter commands
      specifically designed for performing Mobile IPv6 authorization
      decisions.  This document defines these commands and requires the
      HA to support use of these authorization commands and to
      participate in this authorization signaling.

   Accounting:  For billing purposes and capacity planning, it is
      required of the HA to provide accounting report to the Diameter
      infrastructure and thus to support the related Diameter accounting
      procedures.


   Figure 1 depicts the architecture.

5.  Protocol Description

5.1.  Support for Mobile IPv6 with IKEv2 and IPsec

   The use of IKEv2 between the MN and the HA allows the HA to
   authenticate the MN.  When EAP is used with IKEv2, the Diameter EAP
   application, as defined in [7], is re-used.  AVPs specific to Mobile
   IPv6 bootstrapping are added to this command.

   Figure 2 shows the message flow involved during the authentication
   phase when EAP is used.

   The MN and the HA start the interaction with an IKE_SA_INIT exchange.
   In this phase cryptographic algorithms are negotiated, nonces and
   Diffie-Hellman parameters are exchanged.  Message (3) starts the
   IKE_AUTH phase.  This second phase authenticates the previous
   messages, exchanges identities and certificates and establishes the
   first CHILD_SA.  It is used to mutually authenticate the MN (acting

   as an IKEv2 Initiator) and the HA (acting as an IKEv2 Responder).
   The identity of the user/MN is provided in the IDi field.  The MN
   indicates its willingness to be authenticated via EAP by omitting the
   AUTH field in message 3 (see [8]).

   As part of the authentication process, the MN MAY request a Home-
   Address, a Home Prefix or suggests one, see [9], using a CFG_REQUEST
   payload in the message 3.

   The HA extracts the IDi field from the message 3 and sends a
   Diameter-EAP-Request (DER) message towards the authenticating
   Diameter server.

   This message is routed to the MNs Diameter server/EAP server.  The
   Diameter server selects the EAP method and replies with the DEA
   Message.  Depending on the type of EAP method chosen, a number of DER
   and DEA messages carry the method specific exchanges between the MN
   and the Diameter server/EAP server.

   At the end of the EAP authentication phase, the Diameter server
   indicates the result of the authentication in the Result-Code AVP and
   provides the corresponding EAP packet (EAP Success or EAP Failure).
   The last IKEv2 message sent by the HA contains the Home Address or
   the Home Prefix.  In the latter case, a CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange is
   necessary to setup IPsec SAs for Mobile IPv6 signalling.

   In some deployment scenario, the HA may also acts as a IKEv2
   Responder for IPsec VPN access.  A problem in this case is that the
   IKEv2 responder may not know if IK Ev2 is used for MIP6 service or
   for IPsec VPN access.  A network operator needs to be aware of this
   limitation.

5.2.  Support for the Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol

   Figure 3 describes the sequence of messages sent and received between
   the MN, the HA and the Diameter server during the registration when
   RFC 4285 is used.  Binding Update (BU) and Binding Acknowledgement
   (BA) messages are used in the registration process.  This exchange
   triggers the Diameter interaction.

   According to [3] the MN uses the Mobile Node Identifier Option,
   specifically the MN-NAI mobility option as defined in [11] to
   identify itself while authenticating with the HA.

   The MN may use the Message Identifier option for additional replay
   protection.  The authentication option may be used by the MN to
   transfer authentication data when the MN and the HA are utilizing a
   mobility SPI.

   The BU initiates a MIP6-Request-Message to the Diameter server and

5.3.  Mobile IPv6 Session Management

   The Diameter server may maintain state or may be stateless.  This is
   indicated in the Auth-Session-State AVP (or its absence).  The HA
   MUST support the Authorization Session State Machine defined in [6].
   Moreover the following 4 commands may be exchanged between the HA and
   the Diameter server.

5.3.1.  Session-Termination-Request Command

   The Session-Termination-Request (STR) message [6] is sent by the HA
   to inform the Diameter server that an authorized session is being
   terminated.

5.3.2.  Session-Termination-Answer Command

   The Session-Termination-Answer (STA) message [6] is sent by the
   Diameter server to acknowledge the notification that the session has
   been terminated.

5.3.3.  Abort-Session-Request Command

   The Abort-Session-Request (ASR) message [6] is sent by the Diameter
   server to terminates the session.  This fulfills one of the
   requirement described in [12].

6.1.1.  Diameter-EAP-Request (DER)

   The Diameter-EAP-Request (DER) message [7], indicated by the Command-
   Code field set to 268 and the 'R' bit set in the Command Flags field,
   is sent by the HA to the Diameter server to initiate a Mobile IPv6
   service authentication and authorization procedure.  The DER message
   format is the same as defined in [7].  The Application-ID field of
   the Diameter Header MUST be set to the Diameter Mobile IPv6
   Application ID [TO BE ASSIGNED TO IANA].

Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6: HA-to-AAAH Support          June 2007


6.2.1.  MIP6-Request-Message

   The MIP6-Request-Message (MRM), indicated by the Command-Code field
   set to TBD and the 'R' bit set in the Command Flags field, is sent by
   the HA, acting as a Diameter client, in order to request the
   authentication and authorization of a MN.  The HA uses information
   found in the Binding Update to construct the following AVPs, to be
   included as part of the MRM:

   o  Home Address (MIP6-Home-Address AVP)
   o  Mobile Node NAI (User-Name AVP [6])
   o  MN-AAA Authentication Extension (MIP-MN-AAA-Auth AVP)

   If the MN's home address is zero, the HA MUST NOT include a MIP6-
   Home-Address AVP.

   If the MN's home address is all ones, the HA MUST include a MIP6-
   Home-Address AVP, set to all ones.

   The message format is shown below:


           <MIP6-Request-Message> ::= < Diameter Header: 260, REQ, PXY >
             < Session-ID >
             { Auth-Application-Id }
             { User-Name }
             { Destination-Realm }
             { Origin-Host }
             { Origin-Realm }
             [ Acct-Multi-Session-Id ]
             [ Destination-Host ]
             [ Origin-State-Id ]

             { MIP-MN-AAA-Auth }
             [ MIP6-Home-Address ]

             [ Authorization-Lifetime ]
             [ Auth-Session-State ]
             * [ Proxy-Info ]
             * [ Route-Record ]
             * [ AVP ]

6.2.2.  MIP6-Answer-Message

   The MIP6-Answer-Message (MAM) message, indicated by the Command-Code
   field set to TBD and the 'R' bit cleared in the Command Flags field,
   is sent by the Diameter server in response to the MIP6-Request-
   Message message.  The User-Name MAY be included in the MAM if it is

   present in the MRM.  The Result-Code AVP MAY contain one of the
   values defined in Section 6.2.3.2, in addition to the values defined
   in RFC 3588 [6].

   An MAM message with the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS MUST
   include the MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP.  The MIP-Home-Agent-Address
   AVP contains the HA assigned to the MN, while the MIP-Mobile-Node-
   Address AVP contains the home address that was assigned.

   The message format is shown below:


      <MIP6-Answer-Message> ::= < Diameter Header: 260, PXY >
               < Session-Id >
               { Auth-Application-Id }
               { Result-Code }
               { Origin-Host }
               { Origin-Realm }
               [ Acct-Multi-Session-Id ]
               [ User-Name ]
               [ Authorization-Lifetime ]
               [ Auth-Session-State ]
               [ Error-Message ]
               [ Error-Reporting-Host ]
               [ Re-Auth-Request-Type ]

               [ MIP-MN-to-HA-MSA ]
               [ MIP-HA-to-MN-MSA ]
               [ MIP-MSA-Lifetime ]
               [ MIP6-Home-Address ]

               [ Origin-State-Id ]
               * [ Proxy-Info ]
               * [ AVP ]

6.2.3.  Diameter AVPs

   The Diameter client uses AVPs dependent on the usage of RFC 4285 [3]
   or RFC 4877 [2].

   To provide support for RFC 4285 [3] the following AVPs defined in
   [10] are reused in this application:
   o  MIP-HA-to-MN-MSA AVP
   o  MIP-MN-to-HA-MSA AVP
   o  MIP-Session-Key AVP
   o  MIP-Algorithm-Type AVP

   o  MIP-Replay-Mode AVP
   o  MIP-MN-AAA-Auth AVP
   o  MIP-MN-AAA-SPI AVP
   o  MIP-Auth-Input-Data-Length AVP
   o  MIP-Authenticator-Length AVP
   o  MIP-Authenticator-Offset AVP
   o  MIP-MSA-Lifetime AVP
   o  MIP-Mobile-Node-Address (with an IPv6 address)

   For usage with the RFC 4877 [2] only the MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP
   (with IPv6 address) is needed since all other keying related
   parameters are provided by the Diameter EAP application.

6.2.3.1.  Accounting AVPs

   This document reuses the accounting AVPs defined in Diameter Mobile
   IPv4 application [10], namely:

   Accounting-Input-Octets:

      Number of octets in IP packets received from the user
   Accounting-Output-Octets:

      Number of octets in IP packets sent by the user
   Accounting-Input-Packets:

      Number of IP packets received from the user
   Accounting-Output-Packets:

      Number of IP packets sent by the user.

6.2.3.2.  Result-Code AVPs

   This section defines new Result-Code [6] values that MUST be
   supported by all Diameter implementations that conform to this
   specification.

   [Editor's Note: This section needs to list the result codes that are
   used by this application.]

6.2.3.3.  AVP Occurence Tables

   The following table describes the Diameter AVPs defined by this
   document; their AVP Code values, types, and possible flag values; and
   whether the AVP MAY be encrypted.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This section contains the namespaces that have either been created in
   this specification or had their values assigned to existing
   namespaces managed by IANA.

7.1.  Command Codes

   This specification reuses the values 260 and 262 from the Command
   Code namespace defined in [6].  See Section 6 for the assignment of
   the namespace in this specification.

Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6: HA-to-AAAH Support          June 2007


7.2.  Result-Code AVP Values

   This specification assigns the values TBD - TBD from the Result-Code
   AVP (AVP Code 268) value namespace defined in [6].  See
   Section 6.2.3.2 for the assignment of the namespace in this
   specification.

7.3.  Application Identifier

   This specification uses the value TBD to the Application Identifier
   namespace defined in [6].


8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the Diameter interaction required to
   accomplish the split scenario are described in in [9].  Additionally,
   the security considerations of the Diameter Base protocol [6],
   Diameter EAP application [7] are applicable to this document.  This
   document does not introduce new security vulnerabilities.
