1.  Introduction 
    
   The problem of Network Mobility Support (NEMO) is identified in 
   various previous works [3,4,5,6].  In essence, the problem of network 
   in motion is to provide continuous Internet connectivity to nodes in 
   a network that moves as a whole.  Nodes within the network that moves 
   may not be aware of the network changing its point of attachment to 
   the Internet.  This differs from the traditional problem of mobility 
   support as addressed by Mobile IPv4 [7] in Internet Protocol version 
   4 (IPv4) [8] and Mobile IPv6 [9] in Internet Protocol version 6 
   (IPv6) [10]. 
    
   In Mobile IP, each mobile node has a permanent home domain.  When the 
   mobile node is attached to its home network, it is assigned a 
   permanent global address known as a home-address (HoA).  When the 
   mobile node is away, i.e. attached to some other foreign networks, it 
   is usually assigned a temporary global address known as a care-of-
   address (CoA).  The idea of mobility support is such that the mobile 
   node can be reached at the home-address even when it is attached to 
   other foreign networks.  This is done in [7,9] with the introduction 
   of an entity at the home network known as a home agent (HA).  Mobile 
   nodes register their care-of-addresses with the home agents using 
   messages known as Binding Updates.  The home agent is responsible to 
   intercept messages that are addressed to the mobile node's home-
   address, and forward the packet to the mobile node's care-of-address 
   using IP-in-IP Tunneling [11,12]. 
    
   Extending the concept of mobility support for individual hosts to 
   mobility support for a network of nodes, the objective of a network 
   in motion solution is to provide a mechanism where nodes in a mobile 
   network can be reached by their permanent addresses, no matter where 
   on the Internet the mobile network is attached to.  There exist a few 
   prior attempts to provide network mobility support, most of them 
   based on using bi-directional tunnels between the mobile routers and 
   the home agents of the mobile routers [13,14,15,16,17]. 
    
   In bi-directional tunnels between mobile routers and home agents, the 
   mobile router controlling a mobile network performs routing of 
   packets to and from the mobile network when it is in its home domain.  
   When the mobile router and its mobile network move to a foreign 
   domain, the mobile router registers its care-of-address with its home 
   agent.  An IP-in-IP tunnel is then set up between the mobile router 
   and the home agent.  Every packet going to the mobile network will be 
   intercepted by the home agent and forwarded to the mobile router 
   through the IP-in-IP tunnel.  The mobile router then forwards the 
   packet to a host in its mobile network.  When a node in its mobile 
   network wishes to send a packet out of the network, the mobile router 
   intercepts the packet and forward the packet to the home agent

   through the IP-in-IP tunnel.  The home agent then sends the packet 
   out to the intended recipient.  
    
   However, the simple approach of bi-directional tunnel does not cater 
   well to other powerful features of IPv4 and IPv6, such as multi-
   homing.  A network in motion can be multi-homed if there exist a 
   plurality of egress interfaces that offer independent routes to the 
   global Internet.  If all of these interfaces belong to the same 
   mobile router, then only the mobile router is multi-homed.  The 
   mobile network nodes behind the mobile router see only one egress 
   router, thus they are not multi-homed.  On the other hand, if these 
   interfaces belong to separate routers, then the mobile network nodes 
   will see different egress routers and can attach to more than one of 
   these egress routers simultaneously.  These mobile network nodes are 
   thus multi-homed themselves. 
    
   Mobile networks typically have wireless connection to the global 
   network.  Though wireless technology has improved tremendously over 
   the recent years, it is still more prone to channel instability and 
   noise when compared to wired networks.  One of the advantages of 
   multi-homing is that mobile network nodes can use an alternative path 
   to reach and be reached by the global Internet when one of its uplink 
   is down.  This is extremely useful for wireless-based mobile nodes, 
   as it provides a back up mechanism to the unstable wireless uplink. 
    
   However, with bi-directional tunneling mechanism employed by mobile 
   routers, nodes only chose one mobile router as their default router.  
   When this mobile router loses its connection to the global Internet, 
   it can no longer maintain a tunnel with its home agent.  Thus all 
   nodes that made use of the mobile router will lose their connectivity 
   to the global network as well, even though there may exits another 
   mobile router on the same network that has an active link to the 
   global Internet.   
    
   Mobile network nodes may eventually realize that their default router 
   no longer has a route to the global network, and select an alternate 
   mobile router as their default router.  Such a scheme relies on the 
   mobile network nodes to perform their own route discovery.  It adds 
   processing load to mobile network nodes, which may have very limited 
   processing powers (e.g. embedded devices), and incurs additional 
   delays (for the mobile network nodes to realize their current default 
   route is down). In addition, different mobile routers will advertise 
   different subnet prefixes, and thus when mobile nodes eventually 
   switch their default routers, they will have to use different care-
   of-addresses.  This requires sending of binding updates to their 
   home-agents, further increasing the lag of recovery.

1.1.  Terms Used 
    
   It is assumed that readers are familiar with the NEMO terminology 
   described in [18].  In addition, the following definitions of terms 
   are used in this memo: 
    
      Alternate Mobile Router 
    
         This term is used when discussing the behaviour of a mobile 
         router.  It refers to another mobile router that is connected 
         to the same mobile network and has an independent route to the 
         global Internet. 
    
      Alternate Egress Interface 
    
         This term is used when discussing the behaviour of a mobile 
         router with multiple egress interfaces.  It refers to another 
         egress interface that is connected to the global Internet. 
    
      Failed Egress Interface 
    
         This term refers to the egress interface of a mobile router 
         that has lost its connection to the global Internet. 
    
    
1.2.  Organization 
    
   In the remaining portions of this memo, we will first describe the 
   motivations and scenarios for deploying multi-homed mobile networks 
   in Section 2.  The issues in using bi-directional tunneling in a 
   multi-homed mobile network will also be described.  In Section 3, we 
   explore into possible solutions to the problems listed in Section 2, 
   and investigate methods of optimizing bi-directional tunneling to 
   employ features of multi-homing.

2.1.1.  Single Mobile Router with Multiple Egress Interfaces Bound to a 
        Single Home Agent 
    
   First type of multi-homed mobile network contains only one mobile 
   router.  This mobile router have a plurality of egress interfaces, 
   all of which bounds to the same home agent.  In such cases, the 
   mobile router usually only advertise a single network prefix to the 
   mobile network.  This is illustrated in Figure 2.1 below.

   One example of this type of deployment scenario is that a single 
   Internet Service Provider (ISP) offers two different wireless public 
   access methods such as IEEE 802.11 and GPRS.  A mobile router with 
   both access interfaces (i.e. 802.11 and GPRS capabilities) may 
   subscribe to the same ISP and is allowed to use both access methods.  
   The ISP will choose to provide a single home agent for the same 
   mobile router for ease of management. 
    
    
2.1.2.  Single Mobile Router with Multiple Egress Interfaces Bound to 
        Different Home Agents 
    
   The second type of multi-homed mobile network involves a single 
   mobile router with more than one egress interfaces.  Each of these 
   egress interfaces is bound to different home agents.  This is 
   illustrated in Figure 2.2 below.  The mobile router can advertise a 
   single network prefix and inject the appropriate routing update to 
   the home agents (not shown in the figure).  In this case, the mobile 
   router uses only one interface for bi-directional tunneling. 
   Alternatively, the mobile router could also advertise two different 
   network prefixes (as shown in the figure).  Both egress interfaces 
   are then utilized, and the mobile router maintains two active bi-
   directional tunnels with both home agents. 
    
   Example of this kind of deployment scenarios is when a mobile router 
   subscribes to different ISPs.  For instance, it may subscribe to 
   802.11 public access services using one ISP, and subscribe to GPRS 
   services from another ISP.  In this case, the two different ISPs will 
   provide two different home agents for the same mobile router.

2.1.3.  Multiple Mobile Routers 
    
   The third type of multi-homed mobile network involves multiple mobile 
   routers on the same mobile network.  Each of these mobile routers 
   advertise an egress route to the global Internet.  In such cases, two 
   different network prefixes are advertised to the mobile network 
   nodes.  This is illustrated in Figure 2.3 below. 
    
   Example of this kind of deployment scenarios is when a mobile network 
   contains more than one device with independent routes to the global 
   Internet.  An excellent illustration is the Wireless Personal Area 
   Network (W-PAN) where a mobile phone on the W-PAN connects to the

2.2.  Issues of Multi-Homing in NEMO 
    
   When a mobile network is multi-homed, mobile network nodes can choose 
   to use different routes to send packets to the global Internet, 
   either by way of using different global addresses, or by forwarding 
   the packets to different routers.  
    
   However, with bi-directional tunneling mechanism employed by mobile 
   routers, mobile network nodes only chose one mobile router as their 
   default router.  When this mobile router loses its connection to the 
   global Internet, it can no longer maintain a tunnel with its home

   agent.  Thus all mobile network nodes that made use of the mobile 
   router will lose their connectivity to the global network as well.  
   This is hardly desirable, since there may exits another mobile router 
   on the same network that has an active link to the global Internet.   
    
   Mobile network nodes may eventually realize that their default router 
   no longer has a route to the global network, and select an alternate 
   mobile router as their default router.  Such a scheme relies on the 
   mobile network nodes to perform their own route discovery.  It adds 
   processing load to mobile network nodes, which may have very limited 
   processing powers (e.g. embedded devices), and incurs additional 
   delays (for the mobile network nodes to realize their current default 
   route is down). In addition, different mobile routers will advertise 
   different subnet prefixes, and thus when mobile nodes eventually 
   switch their default routers, they will have to use different care-
   of-addresses.  This requires sending of binding updates to their 
   home-agents, further increasing the lag of recovery.

3.  Using Multi-Homing Features in Bi-Directional Tunnels 
    
   In order to utilize the additional robustness provided by multi-
   homing, mobile routers that employ bi-directional tunneling with 
   their home agents should dynamically change their tunnel exit points 
   depending on the link status.  For instance, if a mobile router 
   detects that one of its egress interface is down, it should detect if 
   any other alternate route to the global Internet exists.  This 
   alternate route may be provided by any other mobile routers connected 
   to one of its ingress interfaces that has an independent route to the 
   global Internet, or by another active egress interface the mobile 
   router it self possess.  If such an alternate route exists, the 
   mobile router should re-establish the bi-directional tunnel using 
   this alternate route. 
    
   In the remaining part of this section, we will attempt to investigate 
   methods of performing such re-establishment of bi-directional 
   tunnels.  It is not the objective of this memo to specify a new 
   protocol specifically tailored to provide this form of re-
   establishments.  Instead, we will limit ourselves to currently 
   available mechanisms specified in Mobile IPv6 and Neighbour Discovery 
   in IPv6 [19]. 
    
    
3.1.  Detecting Presence of Alternate Routes 
    
   To actively utilize the robustness provided by multi-homing, a mobile 
   router must first be capable of detecting alternate routes.  This can 
   be manually configured into the mobile router by the administrators 
   if the configuration of the mobile network is relatively static.  It 
   is however highly desirable for mobile routers to be able to discover 
   alternate routes automatically for greater flexibility. 
    
   The case where a mobile router possesses multiple egress interface 
   (bound to the same home agent or otherwise) should be trivial, since 
   the mobile router should be able to "realize" it has multiple routes 
   to the global Internet.   
    
   In the case where multiple mobile routers are on the mobile network, 
   each mobile router has to detect the presence of other mobile router.  
   A mobile router can do so by listening for Router Advertisement 
   message on its *ingress* interfaces. When a mobile router receives a 
   Router Advertisement message with a non-zero Router Lifetime field 
   from one of its ingress interfaces, it knows that another mobile 
   router which can provide an alternate route to the global Internet is 
   present in the mobile network.

3.2.  Re-Establishment of Bi-Directional Tunnels 
    
   When a mobile router detects that the link be which its current bi-
   directional tunnel with its home agent is using is down, it needs to 
   re-establish the bi-directional tunnel using an alternate route 
   detected.  We consider two separate cases here: firstly, the 
   alternate route is provided by another egress interface that belongs 
   to the mobile router; secondly, the alternate route is provided by 
   another mobile router connected to the mobile network.   We refer to 
   the former case as an alternate route provided by an alternate egress 
   interface, and the latter case as an alternate route provided by an 
   alternate mobile router.  
    
3.2.1.  Using Alternate Egress Interface 
    
   When an egress interface of a mobile router loses the connection to 
   the global Internet, the mobile router can make use of its alternate 
   egress interface should it possess multiple egress interfaces. The 
   most direct way to do so is for the mobile router to send a binding 
   update to the home agent of the failed interface using the care-of-
   address assigned to the alternate interface in order to re-establish 
   the bi-directional tunneling using the care-of-address on the 
   alternate egress interface.  After a successful binding update, the 
   mobile router encapsulates outgoing packets through the bi-
   directional tunnel using the alternate egress interface. 
    
   The idea is to use the global address (most likely a care-of-address) 
   assigned to an alternate egress interface as the new (back-up) care-
   of-address of the mobile router to re-establish the bi-directional 
   tunneling with its home agent. 
    
3.2.2.  Using Alternate Mobile Router 
    
   When the mobile router loses a connection to the global Internet, the 
   mobile router can utilize a route provided by an alternate mobile 
   router (if one exists) to re-establish the bi-directional tunnel with 
   its home agent.  First, the mobile router has to obtain a care-of-
   address from the alternate mobile router (i.e. attaches itself to the 
   alternate mobile router).  Next, it sends binding update to its home 
   agent using the care-of-address obtained from the alternate mobile 
   router From then on, the mobile router can encapsulates outgoing 
   packets through the bi-directional tunnel using via the alternate 
   mobile router. 
    
   The idea is to obtain a care-of-address from the alternate mobile 
   router and use this as the new (back-up) care-of-address of the 
   mobile router to re-establish the bi-directional tunneling with its 
   home agent.

   Note that every packet sent from/to mobile network nodes to/from 
   their correspondent nodes will experience two levels of encapsulation.  
   First level of tunneling is done between a mobile router which the 
   mobile network node uses as its default router and the mobile 
   router's home agent.  The second level of tunneling is done between 
   the alternate mobile router and its home agent. 
    
    
3.3.  To Avoid Tunneling Loop 
    
   The method of re-establishing the bi-directional tunnel as described 
   in Section 3.2 may lead to infinite loops of tunneling.  This happens 
   when two mobile routers on a mobile network lose connection to the 
   global Internet at the same time and each mobile router tries to re-
   establish bi-directional tunnel using the other mobile router.  We 
   refer to this phenomenon as tunneling loop. 
    
   One approach to avoid tunneling loop is for a mobile router that has 
   lost connection to the global Internet to insert an option into the 
   Router Advertisement message it broadcasts periodically.  This option 
   serves to notify other mobile routers on the link that the sender no 
   longer provides global connection.  Note that setting a zero Router 
   Lifetime field will not work well since it will cause mobile network 
   nodes that are attached to the mobile router to stop using the mobile 
   router as an access router too  (in which case, things are back to 
   square one). 
    
    
3.4.  Other Considerations 
    
   When a mobile network is multi-homed, mobile network nodes may 
   receive Router Advertisements that advertise different network 
   prefixes.  This is usually the case when the multi-homed mobile 
   network has two or more mobile routers advertising different routes 
   to the global Internet.  It may also occur when the mobile network 
   has only one mobile router with multiple egress interfaces bound to 
   different home agents.  In these situations, mobile network nodes 
   typically only select one to form its global (possibly care-of) 
   address. 
      
   In view of this, it may be desirable for mobile network node to be 
   able to acquire "preference" information on each mobile network 
   prefix from the mobile routers.  This allows default address 
   selection mechanism such as that specified in [20] to be used.  
   Further exploration on setting such "preference" information in 
   Router Advertisement based on performance of the bi-directional 
   tunnel might prove to be useful.

4.  Security Considerations 
    
   Currently the following security threat is identified with multi-
   homing in NEMO: 
    
    - A malicious node in a mobile network advertises an Router 
      Advertisement message with a non-zero Router Lifetime field, 
      tricking mobile network nodes and even mobile routers to forward 
      all packets through it. 
    
   This is not specific to the multi-homing approach described in this 
   document.  However, an authentication mechanism that can authenticate 
   a mobile router from mobile network node when it attaches may be able 
   to prevent such attacks.
