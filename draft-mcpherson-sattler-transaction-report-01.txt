1.  Introduction

   Modern top-level domain registries provide many detailed reports and
   documents that their registrars require on a daily, weekly and
   monthly basis. These most commonly include transaction reports, as
   well as lists containing currently unavailable domains and current
   premium domain fees. These reports are critical for registrars'
   businesses and play an important role in accounting and operations
   processes as well as in sales and marketing activities. In the
   current set-up, registrars must download these reports from each
   registry's intranet differently according to each registry's document
   management set up.
   
   This document describes the content of a Transaction Report based on
   the [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-report-structure] and delivered
   by the [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-reporting-repository].

   DESCRIPTION       It MAY contain a free description of the successful
                     transaction.
   
4.  Transaction Types

   Each transaction MUST be assigned to a type. There are Standard
   Transactions and Non-Standard Transactions.
   
   A successful transaction is also a completed transaction. Therefore,
   transactions MUST NOT be deleted. If a operation MUST be cleared, a
   corresponding counter transaction MUST be made.

4.1.  Standard Transaction Types

   Standard transactions are considered to be CREATE, RENEWAL,
   AUTORENEW, TRANSFER, TRADE, UPDATE, RESTORE and REGISTRYLOCK.

   CREATE        A successful domain create within the reporting period.
   
   RENEWAL       A successful explicit domain name renewal executed by
                 the domain name registrar within the reporting period.
            
   AUTORENEW     A successful domain name auto-renewal by the domain
                 name registry within the reporting period.
              
   TRANSFER      A successful domain name transfer within the reporting
                 period.
              
   TRADE         A successful domain name trade within the reporting
                 period.
              
   UPDATE        A successful billable domain name update within the
                 reporting period.
              
   RESTORE       A successful domain name restore within the reporting
                 period.
                 This event MUST only include the restore fee. Any
                 additional renewal fee MUST be independently listed.

Internet-Draft               Transaction Report               March 2019
  
   REGISTRYLOCK  A successful billable registry lock applied to the
                 domain name within the reporting period.

4.2.  Non-Standard Transaction Types

   Non-Standard Transactions MAY be listed in the report and MAY receive
   a custom type, but it MUST have a corresponding description in the   
   description column.

5.  Transaction Periods
   
   Transaction Types usually occur in Periods of 1 to 10 years, and
   sometimes there are monthly periods. Therefore, each transaction
   MUST either have a Period associated or it MUST be empty if no Period
   is assigned to the operation.
   
   The Period format MUST be in the format <integer>, where
   <integer> MUST be unsigned and between 1 and 65535, without any
   leading zero

   The Term format MUST be in the format <character> and MUST be either 
   'y' for years or 'm' for months.
   
   If the number of months results in a full year, then the year MUST be
   used, e.g. instead of 12,m or 24,m, it should be 1,y respectively
   2,y.
   
6.  Transaction Fees

   All transactions MUST have a Fee associated. The fee amount, the
   currency and the period MUST be listed separately.
   
   Fees MUST either be whole numbers or rounded to two decimal places.
   The dividing point is a period (.).

6.1.  Deviating Fees

   If a domain name incurs a premium fee, that is not the standard price
   for the TLD, a description of the price category SHOULD be given.

7.  Registrar ID

   A unique registrar ID MUST be listed, with each transaction. Those
   IDs MUST be according to the IANA registrar IDs
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/registrar-ids/registrar-ids.xhtml)
   where applicable, otherwise, another unique registrar ID MUST be
   used.

Internet-Draft               Transaction Report               March 2019
   
   [RFC7942] before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature. It
   is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   Add implementation details once available.
