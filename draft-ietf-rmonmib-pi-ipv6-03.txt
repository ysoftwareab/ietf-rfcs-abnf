Internet Draft    Protocol Identifiers for IPv6 and MPLS     March, 2004 
                                      
                                      

1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
 
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of    
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. Managed objects are accessed via a virtual 
   information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  
   MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network 
   Management Protocol (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
   mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI). 
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, 
   which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 
   [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
    
    
2. Overview 
    
   This memo defines basic protocol identifiers for IP version 6 and  
   MPLS protocols.
    
   The "Remote Network Monitoring MIB Protocol Identifier Macros" 
   [RFC2896], defines various protocol identifiers. The syntax of the 
   protocol identifier descriptor is defined in the RMON Protocol 
   Identifier Reference [RFC2895]. The reader should be familiar with 
   these documents. 
    
   The intent of this document is not to adapt each protocol identifier 
   defined in the RFC 2895 and in the RFC 2896 to IP version 6, but to 
   define protocol identifiers for IP version 6 protocols and for MPLS 
   protocol. 
   
    
3. Relationship to the Remote Network Monitoring MIB 
    
   RMON MIB implementations use protocol identifiers to describe 
   unambiguous capabilities in protocolDirTable entries. 
    
    
    
4. MPLS layer protocol identifiers 
    
   This section defines protocol identifiers for MPLS with unambiguous
   names to distinguish MPLS Unicast from MPLS Multicast.
     
     
 
 
-- MPLS unicast
