 12.1  IANA Considerations for PW-ENET-STD-MIB 

   
2. Introduction 
   
  This document describes a model for managing Ethernet pseudo wire 
  services for transmission over a packet Switched Network (PSN). This 
  MIB module is generic and common to all types of PSNs supported in 
  the PWE3 architecture [RFC3985], which describes the transport and 
  encapsulation of L1 and L2 services over supported PSN types. 
   
  In particular, the MIB module associates a port or specific VLANs on 
  top of a physical Ethernet port or a virtual Ethernet interface (for 
  VPLS service) to a point-to-point PW. It is complementary to the 
  [PWMIB], which is used to manage the generic PW parameters common to 
  all service, including all supported PSN types. 


3. Terminology 
   
  This document uses terminology from the document describing the 
  PWE3 architecture [RFC3985] and from [PWENET]. 

4. The Internet-Standard Management Framework  
      
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580

   [RFC2580].    
      
    
6. PWE3 MIB Architecture Applicability

  The MIB module structure for defining a PW service is composed of 
  three layers of MIB modules functioning together. This general model 
  is defined in the PWE3 architecture [RFC3985], and described in
  further detail in [PWMIB]. The MIB module defined in this
  document defines a element of the service layer containing an
  ethernet service-specific module. 
   
  The Etherlike-MIB [RFC3635] does not support virtual Ethernet ports, 
  however it is sometimes desired to manage the PW as an Ethernet port 
  via the Etherlike-MIB. This MIB module supports an option to 
  recognize the PW as an ifIndex, enabling standard use of the 
  Etherlike-MIB to manage the PW. 
   
5.1  PW-ENET-STD-MIB Usage 
   
  - The PW table (pwTable) is used for all PW types (ATM, FR, 
    Ethernet, SONET, etc.). This table contains high level generic 
    parameters related to the PW creation. A row is typically created 
    by the operator (see [PWMIB] for other options) for each PW 
    service. 
   
  - Based on the PSN type defined for the PW, rows are created in PSN 
    specific module and associated to the 
    pwTable by the common pwIndex. 

  - If the PW type is Ethernet or EthernetTagged a row is created by 
    the agent in pwEnetTable. 
     
  - When using a MPLS PSN, it may be required to separate the same 
    Ethernet services to multiple PWs in order to support multiple COS 
    on the same service. In this case, multiple PWs, each with the 
    appropriate COS will be created to the same destination, and 
    classification will be based also on the Ethernet PRI bits 
    marking. The MIB allow any combinations of multiple PRI setting 
    to PSN COS mapping (The exact PSN marking (EXP bits, DSCP etc.) 
    is out of scope of this MIB). In these cases, pwEnetTable will 
    hold multiple rows with the same Ethernet port and VLAN mapping, 
    each PW will need to be created separately by the signaling 
    process.  
     
5.2  PW-ENET-STD-MIB Management Model 
   
  The management model for the Ethernet PW is shown in figure 1, and 
  is based on the PW proposed layering [RFC3985].

                          May be modeled as 
                              ifIndex 

     Notation: 
     o       A physical CE-bound PE port 
     +       A PW IWF instance interface to the forwarder. 
     X       A PE PSN-bound port. 
   
               Figure 1: A simple point-to-point service 
   
   
  In the typical point-to-point service, the object 
  pwEnetPortIfIndex associates the physical CE-bound PE port ('o') 
  to the PW (it is allowed to have multiple PWs associated to the same 
  physical port). This MIB module also manages some of the possible 
  operations of the forwarder. 
   
  In some models it is convenient to model the forwarder virtual 
  interface to a PW IWF instance ('+') as an ifIndex. As discussed in 

  the [PWMIB], this is possible by using the PW ifType in the ifTable 
  and indicating the ifIndex in the main pwTable. In case of 
  Ethernet PW a virtual interface of ifType = etherLike will be 
  assigned on top of the PW interface to enable statistics gathering 
  and statuses and other management configuration tasks via existing 
  tools. This way, the PW instance is managed as virtual Ethernet 
  interface in the PE. 
   
  The model for using the PW in non-point to point applications, such 
  as VPLS are done with the same principle in mind, except that the 
  creation of the tables is related typically to an auto-discovery 
  process. 
   
5.3  Example of MIB usage 
   
  Assume we would like to create a PW of type VLAN between two PEs, 
  for VLAN value 5. 
   
  - Follows the example in [PWMIB], except that the pwType is equal 
    'ethernetTagged'.

  - The agent creates a row in pwEnetTable and pwEnetStatsTable 
    for the specified pwindex. The pwEnetPwInstance is automatically 
    selected by the agent to the value of '1'. 
   
  - The operator fills the following entries in the pwEnetTable: 
   
         pwEnetPwVlan        5, 
         pwEnetVlanMode      noChange, 
         pwEnetPortVlan      5, 
   
         pwEnetPortIfIndex   1001, 
         pwEnetVcIfIndex     0, -- Not managed in the  
                                  -- Etherlike MIB module 
         .. . 
   
  - The PW is ready for forwarding when signaling has been accomplished 
    successfully between the two peers. 
   
   
5.4  Service Delimiting Modes  
   
  In this section we will describe how the MIB module supports point-
  to-point applications with various VLAN service delimiting options 
  on the physical port and the PW modes and VLAN values. In the VPLS 
  case the PW is attached to a virtual interface that is attached to a 
  bridge or VPLS forwarder, and it is assumed that this bridge 
  function would be responsible for the packet modifications between 
  the physical port or other virtual port and the virtual port the PW 
  is attached to.  
   
  There are 3 main services that are supported by this MIB module. 
   
  1) Port mode: In this mode, the whole traffic from the port is 
  mapped to the PW.  
   
  1a) In the typical application, the packet is sent to the PW as is: 
   
         pwEnetPwVlan        4097, 
         pwEnetVlanMode      portMode, 
         pwEnetPortVlan      4097, 
         pwType              Ethernet, 
   
  1a) It is possible to add a provider tag (value 10 for example) to 
  the packet when it is sent over the PW: 
   
         pwEnetPwVlan        10, 
         pwEnetVlanMode      addVlan, 
         pwEnetPortVlan      4097,

Internet Draft                PW-ENET-STD-MIB               July 2005


  pwType MAY equal 'Ethernet' or 'EthernetTagged', 'EthernetTagged' 
  is RECOMMENDED. 
   
  2) Single VLAN: In this mode, only the first VLAN field on the 
  packet from the physical port is the service delimiting tag, as an 
  example VLAN=5. The following options of processing are possible: 
   
  2a) One to one mapping: the service delimiting tag is kept as is on 
  the PW. 
   
         pwEnetPwVlan        5, 
         pwEnetVlanMode      noChange, 
         pwEnetPortVlan      5, 
   
  pwType MAY equal 'Ethernet' or 'EthernetTagged', 'EthernetTagged' 
  is RECOMMENDED. 
   
  2b) One to one mapping: the service delimiting tag change it's value 
  (to value of 6) on the PW. 
   
         pwEnetPwVlan        6, 
         pwEnetVlanMode      changeVlan, 
         pwEnetPortVlan      5, 
   
  pwType MAY equal 'Ethernet' or 'EthernetTagged', 'EthernetTagged' 
  is RECOMMENDED. 

  2c) The service delimiting tag is removed when the packet is sent to 
  the PW. 

         pwEnetPwVlan        5, 
         pwEnetVlanMode      removeVlan, 
         pwEnetPortVlan      4097, 
   
  pwType MAY equal 'Ethernet' or 'EthernetTagged', 'EthernetTagged' 
  is RECOMMENDED. 
   
  One should note that this mode is also applicable when the service 
  delimiting tag is a service provider tag (VLAN=5 in this case), and 
  the service provider actually replace the map the traffic to a 
  single PW independent of the packet format on top of this VLAN.  

  
  2d) Untagged packets mapped to a PW as is (packets with a VLAN field 
  from tha same port MAY be mapped to other PWs). 
   
         pwEnetPwVlan        4096, 
         pwEnetVlanMode      noChange, 
         pwEnetPortVlan      4096,

Internet Draft                PW-ENET-STD-MIB               July 2005


  pwType MAY equal 'Ethernet' or 'EthernetTagged', 'EthernetTagged' 
  is RECOMMENDED. 

  2e) Untagged packets mapped to a PW, and a VLAN field is added to 
  the packet.  
   
         pwEnetPwVlan        6, 
         pwEnetVlanMode      addVlan, 
         pwEnetPortVlan      4096, 
   
  pwType MAY equal 'Ethernet' or 'EthernetTagged', 'EthernetTagged' 
  is RECOMMENDED. 

  2f) A provider VLAN (value 10) is added to the packet coming with 
  VLAN value 5 before it is sent to the PW. 
   
         pwEnetPwVlan        10, 
         pwEnetVlanMode      addVlan, 
         pwEnetPortVlan      5, 
   
  pwType MAY equal 'Ethernet' or 'EthernetTagged', 'EthernetTagged' 
  is RECOMMENDED. 

  3) Nested VLAN (QinQ): When only the first VLAN is the service 
  delimiting tag, the modes as described in 2) SHOULD be used. In 
  other cases, i.e. the service delimiting tag is both the first VLAN 
  and the second VLAN, the following option is supported by this MIB 
  module. Other scenarios are considered out of the scope and should 
  be handled by other MIB modules that manage the forwarder.  
   
  Assuming the provider tag equals 5 and the (inner) VLAN equal 100, 
  this traffic can be mapped to the PW without the provider tag by 
  using the following configuration: 
   
         pwEnetPwVlan        100, 
         pwEnetVlanMode      removeVLAN, 
         pwEnetPortVlan      5, 
   
  pwType MAY equal 'Ethernet' or 'EthernetTagged', 'EthernetTagged'
  is RECOMMENDED. 
   
  Packets of the same provider tag MAY be mapped to other PWs.

            structure (i.e. there is no service delimiting VLAN tags 
            from the PE standpoint).  
   
          - 'noChange' indicates that the PW contains the original 
             user VLAN, as specified in pwEnetPortVlan, i.e. the 
             VLAN on the PE-CE link is the service delimiting tag

8. Security Considerations 
   
  It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for 
  Monitoring of Ethernet PW capable PEs.  This MIB module can also be 
  used for configuration of certain objects, and anything that can be 
  configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially 
  disastrous results. 
      
  There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
  with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
  objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
  environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
  network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their 
  sensitivity/vulnerability: 
   
     o    the pwEnetTable and the pwEnetMplsPriMappingTable 
          collectively contain objects to provision Ethernet PWs.  
          Unauthorized access to objects in these tables, could result  
          in disruption of traffic on the network.  The use of  
          stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be  
          considered where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and  
          USM MUST be used with any v3 agent which implements this MIB  
          module.

          Administrators should consider whether read access to these  
          objects should be allowed, since read access may be  
          undesirable under certain circumstances. 
   
  Some of the readable objects in this MIB module "i.e., objects with 
  a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible" may be considered sensitive 
  or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to 
  control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly 
  to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over 
  the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their 
  sensitivity/vulnerability: 
   
     o    the pwEnetTable and the pwEnetMplsPriMappingTable 
          collectively show the Ethernet PW service configuration.  
          If an Administrator does not want to reveal this 
          information, then these tables should be 
          considered sensitive/vulnerable. 
   
  SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
  Even if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec", 
  even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
  allowed to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the 
  objects in this MIB module. 
   
  It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
  as provided by the SNMPv3 framework "see [RFC3410], section 8", 
  including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms "for 
  authentication and privacy". 
   
  Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
  RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
  enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
  instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access 
  to the objects only to those principals "users" that have legitimate 
  rights to indeed GET or SET "change/create/delete" them.
