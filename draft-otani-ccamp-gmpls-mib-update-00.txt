Abstract 
    
   This memo describes the necessity of generalized multi-protocol label 
   switching (GMPLS) management information base (MIB) family update. 
   Since the establishment of basic GMPLS protocol specifications, 
   additional functionalities has been proposed and standardized so far, 
   such as recovery, call support, optical transport network (OTN) 
   support and so forth. Coinciding with these additional specifications, 
   GMPLS MIB family is also desired to be updated to manage GMPLS 
   networks appropriately. This document is to clarify missing pieces in 
   currently defined GMPLS MIB family due to the enhancement of original 
   GMPLS protocols.

1. Introduction 
    
   With standardizing basic GMPLS protocols, ccamp WG has also defined 
   related GMPLS MIBs to manage label switched routers (LSRs), label 
   switched paths (LSPs) and TE links. However, as the time being, 
   additional functionalities have been proposed and standardized so far, 
   such as recovery, call support, OTN support and so forth. Coinciding 
   with these specifications, GMPLS MIB family is desired to be updated 
   to manage GMPLS networks appropriately. This document is to clarify 
   missing pieces in currently defined GMPLS MIB family due to the 
   enhancement of GMPLS protocols and to propose to start the update 
   work of GMPLS MIB family. 
    
    
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 
    
 
3. GMPLS MIB family 
    
   CCAMP WG created series of GMPLS MIB specification so far to manage 
   label switched routers (LSRs), label switched paths (LSPs) and 
   traffic engineering (TE) links, accompanying with MPLS MIBs created 
   in MPLS WG, summarized as follows, 
    
   (1) GMPLS TC MIB: [RFC4801] 
   (2) LSRs (Nodes) 
    - GMPLS LSR MIB: [RFC4803] 
      (MPLS LSR MIB: [RFC3813]) 
   (3) LSPs (Paths) 
   - GMPLS TE MIB: [RFC4802] 
      (MPLS TE MIB: [RFC3812]) 
   (4) TE Links (Links) 
   - LMP MIB: [RFC4631] 
     (TE link MIB: [RFC4220]) 
    
   CCAMP WG is also working for the MIB specification to manage TE 
   database information. 
    
   (5) TE database (routing)  
   - TEDB MIB: [GMPLS-TED-MIB] 
    
    
4. GMPLS protocol updates 
    
   Since the establishment of the original GMPLS protocol specifications, 
   additional functionalities have been added so far summarized as 
   follows. 
    
   Original signaling specifications [RFC3471, RFC3473] were mainly 
   updated for the inclusion of

   - Egress support [RFC4003] 
   - OTN support [RFC4328] 
   - Exclude route [RFC4874] 
   - Recovery of end-to-end and segment-by-segment [RFC4872, RFC4873] 
   - Call support [RFC4974] 
    
   Moreover, in the future, this will be also updated by 
   - Ethernet support 
   - Lambda support 
    
    
5. Missing pieces of GMPLS MIB Family 
    
   Here is a possible list of future inclusion to GMPLS MIB Family. 
   Inclusion will be determined according to GMPLS OAM requirements 
   [GMPLS-OAM-REQ]. 
    
   (1) Node 
   - Ingress and Egress port control information of each LSP 
   - OTN label as GMPLS label types 
   - Administrative status of cross-connections for recovery purpose 
    
   (2) Paths 
   - GMPLS recovery types of LSPs 
   - LSP status information related with recovery 
   - Ingress/Egress port information of GMPLS LSPs 
    
   (3) Link 
   - OTN as an encoding type 
    
    
6. Security consideration 
    
   This document introduces no new security considerations in [RFC3471] 
   and [RFC3471]. 
    
    
7. IANA Considerations 
    
   A. Must specify if IANA has to create a new registry or modify rules 
   for an existing registry.  
   B. Must specify if the document requires IANA to assign or update 
   values in an IANA registry before RFC publication.  
   C. See "Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in 
   RFCs" [RFC2434] (Narten, T. and H. Alvestrand, "Guidelines for 
   Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs, " October 1998.) and 
   in some cases also "IANA Allocation Guidelines For Values In the 
   Internet Protocol and Related Headers" [RFC2780] (Bradner, S. and V. 
   Paxson, "IANA Allocation Guidelines For Values In the Internet 
   Protocol and Related Headers, " March 2000.). In some case "Assigning 
   Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful" [RFC3692] (Narten, 
   T., "Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful," 
   January 2004.) may help as well.

   If there is no action for IANA, the section should say that, e.g., 
   including something like "This document has no actions for IANA."

   The authors would like to express their thanks to Adrian Farrel for 
   the discussion.
