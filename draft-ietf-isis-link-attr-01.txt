Abstract 
    
   This document defines a sub-TLV called "Link-attributes" carried 
   within the TLV 22 and used to flood some link characteristics.

1. Introduction 
    
   [IS-IS] specifies the IS-IS protocol (ISO 10589) with extensions to 
   support IPv4 in [IS-IS-IP]. A router advertises one or several Link 
   State Protocol data units which are composed of variable length 
   tuples called TLVs (Type-Length-Value). 
    
   [IS-IS-TE] defines a set of new TLVs whose aims are to add more 
   information about links characteristics, increase the range of IS-IS 
   metrics and optimize the encoding of IS-IS prefixes.  
    
   This document defines a new sub-TLV named "Link-attributes" carried 
   within the extended IS reachability TLV (type 22) specified in [IS-
   IS-TE]. 
    
2. Link-attributes sub-TLV format 
    
   The link-attribute sub-TLV is carried within the TLV 22 and has a 
   format identical to the sub-TLV format used by the Traffic 
   Engineering Extensions for IS-IS [IS-IS-TE]: 1 octet of sub-type, 1 
   octet of length of the value field of the sub-TLV followed by the 
   value field in this case, a 16 bit flags field. 
    
   The Link-attribute sub-type is 19 (to be assigned by IANA) and has a 
   length of 2 octets. 
    
   This sub-TLV is OPTIONAL and MAY appear at most once for a single IS 
   neighbor. 
    
   The following bits are defined:

   Local Protection Available (0x01). When set, this indicates that the 
   link is protected by means of some local protection mechanism (e.g 
   [FRR]). 
    
   Link excluded from local protection path (0x02). When set, this link 
   SHOULD not be included in any computation of a repair path by any 
   other router in the routing area. The triggers for setting up this 
   bit are out of the scope of this document. 
    
   Such link characteristics has several applications such as 
   constrained shortest path computation for a Traffic Engineering Label 
   Switched (TE LSP) path or the triggering of specific actions in the 
   context of IS-IS SPF computation. 
    
   Local maintenance required (0x04). When set, this indicates that the 
   link will be put out of service and will consequently be shortly 
   unavailable. The set of actions triggered by other nodes is out of 
   the scope of this document. An example of the usage of this bit is 
   provided in [GR-SHUT]. 
    
3. Interoperability with routers non supporting this capability 
 
   A router not supporting the link-attribute sub-TLV MUST just silently 
   ignore this sub-TLV. 
    
   Where the information in the link attributes sub-TLV is used to 
   affect the IS-IS SPF calculation, additional information indicating 
   which routers are using this information is required to insure such 
   usage does not result in loops or black holes. How this additional 
   information is conveyed is outside the scope of this document. 
  
4. Security considerations 
 
   No new security issues are raised in this document. 
    
5. IANA considerations 
 
   IANA will assign a new codepoint for the link-attribute sub-TLV 
   defined in this document and carried within TLV 22. Suggested value 
   is 19 (to be assigned by IANA). 
    
6. Intellectual Property Considerations

   Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be claimed to 
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in 
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights 
   might or might not be available; nor does it represent that it has
