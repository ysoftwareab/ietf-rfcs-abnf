Abstract

The IPv6 Addressing Architecture [Hinden, 1998] defines the "IPv4-mapped
IPv6 address."  This representation is used in the IPv6 basic API
[Gilligan, 1999] to denote IPv4 addresses using AF_INET6 sockets.  The
use of IPv4-mapped addresses on AF_INET6 sockets degrades portability,
complicates IPv6 systems, and is likely to create security problems.
This document discusses each issue in turn.  Finally, it proposes to
resolve these problems by recommending deprecation of this mechanism.


1.  Drawbacks due to IPv4 mapped address support

1.1.  Degraded portability

RFC2553 section 3.7 specifies the behavior of IPv4-mapped addresses with
an AF_INET6 socket.  However, the description fails to specify important
details that are necessary for good portability.  Specifically, the

specification needs to define:

(1) The interaction between multiple bind(2) attempts to the same port,
    with different addresses.  What happens when an application does and
    does not call setsockopt(..., SO_REUSEPORT, ...) in order to bind(2)
    to the same port on AF_INET and AF_INET6?  What happens when an
    application calls bind(2) on AF_INET socket, and an application
    calls bind(2) on an AF_INET6 socket with IPv4-mapped address?  Note
    that there are many more issues here that need specification.

(2) The selection/interaction of port numbers between AF_INET and
    AF_INET6 sockets on bind(2) and/or connect(2) system calls.  This is
    related to (1).

(3) The treatment of socket options (setsockopt(2) and getsockopt(2))
    with IPv4-mapped addresses on AF_INET6 sockets.  What happens when
    an application calls setsockopt(2) for IPv4 options or IPv6 options
    on an AF_INET6 socket that is not yet bound (and, therefore, the
    host does not know if IPv4 or IPv6 communication will be used)?
    What happens when an application calls setsockopt(2) for IPv4
    options or IPv6 options on an AF_INET6 socket that is bound to
    IPv4-mapped addresses?

(4) The delivery of multicast packets to AF_INET and AF_INET6 sockets.
    What happens when an application binds to the IPv6 unspecified
    address (::) with a certain port -- does it receive IPv4 multicast
    traffic as well?  What will be the relationship between
    IP_MULTICAST_IF and IPV6_MULTICAST_IF socket options?  What happens
    when an application calls sendto(2) to an IPv4-mapped address for an
    IPv4 multicast address? How will the source address will be
    selected?

Due to these ambiguities, developers of applications that use
IPv4-mapped addresses on AF_INET6 sockets might encounter portability
problems.

1.2.  Increased implementation complexity

Implementation of IPv4-mapped addresses has a real and significant cost,
both in the system software (e.g., network stack, kernel, and system
libraries) and in the application software (ALL of which must now
correctly handle IPv4-mapped addresses).  The combined man-time for
developers, testers, document writers, and support staff is a real and
potentially tangible added cost of this particular feature.  Because
applications are affected, the number of implementations for which this
cost will apply has the potential to be huge.

Implementation of IPv4-mapped addresses increases the complexity of all
IPv6 implementations, both in the system software and in the application
software.  Increased complexity is bad for software engineering reasons
beyond the scope of this document.  Technology market forces and
Internet history have demonstrated that simpler protocols and simpler

systems have a tendency to be more successful than complex alternatives.

If the community wishes to see IPv6 achieve successful deployment, it is
important that the resource costs and complexity costs associated with
IPv6 be as low as possible.  Where opportunities exist to decrease these
costs, the community should seriously consider doing so in order to
nurture deployment.

1.3.  Access control complexity

RFC2553 section 3.7 adds extra complexity to address-based access
controls.  It is likely that there will be many errors introduced by of
this.

Due to RFC2553 section 3.7, AF_INET6 sockets will accept IPv4 packets.
On an IPv4/v6 dual stack node, if there is no AF_INET listening socket,
most users would believe that there will be no access from IPv4 peers.
However, if an AF_INET6 listening socket is present, IPv4 peers will be
able to access the service.  This is likely to confuse users and result
in configuration errors that can be exploited by malicious parties.  (It
is violating the security principle of least surprise)

AF_INET6 sockets will accept IPv4 packets even (and especially) if the
application is not expecting them.  Every application that uses AF_INET6
sockets MUST correctly handle reception of IPv4 packets.  Failure of a
developer to consider every relevant case might lead to a security
problem.  This is likely to be overlooked by developers -- especially
those new to IPv6 development (as most are).  This is likely to result
in applications with flaws that can be exploited by malicious parties.
(Again, this is violating the security principle of least surprise)

Systems that support IPv4 communications on AF_INET6 sockets using
IPv4-mapped addresses have a greater potential to have security problems
than they would if they did not have this feature.


2.  Recommended solution

o Deprecate RFC2553 section 3.7.  By doing so, IPv6 implementations will
  be greatly simplified, both in the system software and in all IPv6
  application software.


3.  Alternative solution

o Expand RFC2553 section 3.7 to fully define the behavior of AF_INET6
  sockets using IPv4-mapped addresses.

o Change the default value for IPV6_V6ONLY socket option defined in
  [Gilligan, 2002] to "on."  With this approach, systems must still
  implement the complex interactions between AF_INET and AF_INET6
  socket, which can lead to security problems.  Also, once a application

  turns the socket option off, it MUST correctly handle all cases where
  an IPv4-mapped address might be used or it may have security problems.


4.  Implementation tips to application developers

o In EVERY application, check for IPv4-mapped addresses wherever
  addresses enter code paths under your control (i.e., are returned from
  system calls, or from library calls, or are input from the user or a
  file), and handle them in an appropriate manner.  This approach is
  difficult in reality, and there is no way to determine whether it has
  been followed fully.

o Do not intentionally use RFC2553 section 3.7 (IPv4 traffic on AF_INET6
  socket).  Implement server applications by using separate AF_INET and
  AF_INET6 listening sockets.  Explicitly set the IPV6_V6ONLY socket
  option to on, whenever the socket option is available on the system.

     NOTE: Due to the lack of standard behavior in bind(2) semantics,
     this may not be possible on some systems.  Some IPv6 stack does not
     permit bind(2) to 0.0.0.0, after bind(2) to ::.  Also, there is no
     standard on how IPv4 traffic will be routed when both 0.0.0.0 and
     :: listening sockets are available on the same port.

o Implement programs in a protocol-independent manner using
  getaddrinfo(3) and getnameinfo(3), instead of hard-coding AF_INET6.
  RFC2553 section 3.7 leads people to port IPv4 application to IPv6 by
  replacing AF_INET into AF_INET6.  However, by hard-coding AF_INET6
  into the program, developers are failing to correct their dependencies
  on particular protocol families.  As a consequence, any future
  protocol support will again require the application to be modified.
  Applications that hard-code AF_INET6 require IPv6-capable systems and
  will fail on a system that only has IPv4 support.  It is critical to
  implement programs in a protocol-independent manner if you want to
  ship a single program (binary/source) that runs on IPv4-only,
  IPv6-only, as well as IPv4/v6 dual stack systems.


5.  Security considerations
