C=0 indicates the 32-bit CCI field format is to be used.

C=1 indicates the 64-bit CCI field format is to be used.

C=2 indicates the 96-bit CCI field format is to be used.

C=3 indicates the 128-bit CCI field format is to be used.

T = 0 indicates that the Sender Current Time (SCT) field is not
T = 1 indicates that the SCT field is present.  The SCT is
R = 0 indicates that the Expected Residual Time (ERT) field is not
R = 1 indicates that the ERT field is present.

EXT_NOP=0     No-Operation extension.  The information present in
                 this extension field MUST be ignored by receivers.

EXT_AUTH=1    Packet authentication extension Information used to
                 authenticate the sender of the packet.  The format of
                 this Header Extension and its processing is outside the
                 scope of this document and is to be communicated out-
                 of-band as part of the Session Description.

                 It is RECOMMENDED that senders provide some form of
                 packet authentication.  If EXT_AUTH is present,
                 whatever packet authentication checks that can be
                 performed immediately upon reception of the packet
                 SHOULD be performed before accepting the packet and
                 performing any congestion control-related action on it.
                 Some packet authentication schemes impose a delay of
                 several seconds between when a packet is received and
                 when the packet is fully authenticated.  Any congestion
                 control related action that is appropriate MUST NOT be
                 postponed by any such full packet authentication.

EXT_FTI=64    FEC Object Transmission Information extension The
                 purpose of this extension is to carry in-band the FEC
                 Object Transmission Information for an object.  The
                 format of this Header Extension and its processing is
                 outside the scope of this document and is to be
                 communicated out-of-band as part of the Session
                 Description.
