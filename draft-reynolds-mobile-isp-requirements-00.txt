Abstract 
    
   The growth in mobile terminal access to the Internet has been one of 
   the greatest growth areas in the past year. Indeed the so-called 3rd 
   generation mobile networks being designed are premised upon Internet 
   services and protocols. Both mobility and wireless access bring with 
   them unique requirements that needs to be addressed within the 
   Internet community such as address space and limited access 
   bandwidth. This document is a synthesis of a yearlong study of 
   mobile operators and mobile ISPs to crystallise these unique 
   requirements. These are provided for guidance and are not intended 
   to be prescriptive on the current Internet Architectural Framework.

   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
    
Overview 
    
   The mobile wireless industry is undertaking a major infrastructure 
   change. Its current network was built with only one application in 
   mind: telephony. The industry is developing new network 
   infrastructure that would allow its users to handle many 
   applications. The guiding model is to bring to the industry the same 
   application richness that has benefited Internet users via fixed 
   access networks. The goal of the industry is to transform the 
   current cellular mobile network from an application-dependent into 
   an application-independent wireless access network to the Internet. 
    
   Fixed telephony systems initiated a move towards IP infrastructure 
   because: 
   * development of intelligent terminals enabled their handling of the 
   session control functions. This implied a new framework. It became 
   possible to have a softswitch architecture supported by an open IP 
   access infrastructure. This means that the provider of the 
   softswitch doesn't need to be the same as that of the access 
   network. 
   * intelligent terminals make it easier to implement end-to-end 
   systems 

   A wireless Internet framework adopts the distributed nature of the 
   Internet. The Internet Architecture is based on the end-to-end 
   principle where application and control functionality is located at 
   the periphery of the network. The network serves only as a transport 
   infrastructure with no applications and control functions embedded 
   in it. The network becomes application-independent and dumb. 
    
   The fundamental contribution of the wireless-internet efforts are to 
   create a wireless access infrastructure that makes possible end-to-
   end IP transport between wireless devices, and, between a wireless 
   device and any other device or application connected to the 
   Internet. 
    
   Wireless Internet access will support any application that can use 
   the Internet for transmission of information and one of these 
   applications is telephony. This infrastructure change presents a 
   fundamental change in the service provider business models. It 
   represents a shift from being the provider of access to one service 
   owned by the ISP (plus low bandwidth access to Internet) to 
   providing access to the Internet, where end-users may find many 
   services which are not owned by the access provider. Indeed, some of 
   the telephony services traditionally offered by the access provider, 
   could be offered by a third party provider.  
    
    
Current Mobile Wireless Telephone Networks 
    


   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
   The current mobile wireless telephone networks have been designed to 
   optimally handle telephony. Mobile wireless networks are circuit-
   switched and therefore one of its key components the Mobile 
   Switching Centre (MSC), which is the equivalent of a Central Office 
   switch in a fixed telephone network. The other components in this 
   architecture handle functions exclusive of mobile cellular networks. 
   These functions are: 
   * registration (or location updating) and de-registration of a user 
   terminal as it moves from one point of attachment to another (this 
   involves AAA functions) 
   * seamless reconfiguration (re-routeing) of voice circuits from one 
   point of attachment to another 
   * routeing & authorisation of signalling messages to and from mobile 
   stations. 
    
   These functions are provided by the combination of Home Location 
   Register (HLR), Visiting Location Register (VLR), MSC, base station 
   (BS), base station controller (BSC) and Authentication Centre (AuC). 
 
    
Wireless Internet Access 
    
   The motivation for a wireless access to the Internet is to have an 
   infrastructure that is independent of applications, whose function 
   is to provide transport for IP packets going from one end device to 
   the other. The fundamental difference with fixed Internet access 
   networks is that the attachment point of end devices to the Internet 
   changes as users of devices are in motion.  
    
   Moving to a wireless Internet access framework, involves making 
   radical changes to the wireless infrastructure. Some of these 
   changes will take place in the Radio Access Network (RAN) and some 
   in the access control infrastructure (commonly referred as the core 
   network). 
    
   The ideal IP access infrastructure is one where the RAN is an IP 
   network where base stations, base station controllers, and mobile 
   terminals communicate via IP protocols. There is considerable 
   ongoing work in this area (e.g., the Open RAN work within the MWIF). 
   Initially, the RAN will be implemented as a link layer between 
   mobile terminals and the core access network; as a second stage the 
   RAN will become an IP-routed network. The RAN is a very complex 
   system handling mobility within the multiple base stations in an 
   access network, this involves complex mechanisms and protocols 
   between the mobile station and its various elements. The RAN handles 
   micro-mobility (through soft and hard handoff mechanisms), load 
   control, admission control, relocation, etc., and also provides 
   synchronisation mechanisms for node synchronisation.  
    
   The ideal situation is that all mobility management is performed via 
   IP protocols. However, RANs require massive investments and it is 
   necessary to have a gradual transition process. Some of these RANs 
   have their own mobility management techniques, which are transparent 
    Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
   to IP protocols. Mobility management functions at layer 3 utilising 
   IP in the core and a non-IETF protocol (e.g. Radio Resource Control 
   - RRC) in the access network. 
 

 Fundamental Technical Challenges 

   There has been considerable work in designing all-IP frameworks for 
   fixed access networks. What makes wireless systems special, are they 
   not just another kind of Internet access technology? The answer is 
   yes, but they have special requirements over the fixed access 
   technologies. The requirements stem from solving problems associated 
   with wireless access: 
   * mobile IP routeing - rapid handoff between access points 
   * fast registration and de-registration on handoff between disparate 
   technologies (micro v macro mobility) 
   * maintaining context and QoS in handoff. 
   * supporting session handoff between terminal technologies. 
   * supporting transport (i.e. seamless data flow) handoff between 
   technologies _ macrodiversity combining. 
   * determining how link loss is detected _ in advance or after the 
   event? 
   * determining what are the measurement reporting requirements. 
   * determining how all-IP hard/soft hand off can be achieved in 
   required time limits. 
   * assess the extent to which mobility can/should be hierarchical. 
   * defining how location management would be achieved, and how a 
   `location/routing area' would be defined, e.g. paging at layer 3 
   * defining the communication required between the network 
   measurement function, the policy broker and the subscriber and 
   equipment databases. 
   * defining how the mobility decision will be handled and executed. 
    

 Wireless Internet Access Frameworks  

   Multiple organisations are working on defining wireless all-IP 
   access frameworks. They include 3GPP, 3GPP2, and MWIF. 3GPP is 
   chartered with providing a migration path for GSM. 3GPP2 is 
   chartered with providing a migration path for IS41. MWIF is 
   chartered with providing a developing an architecture for cellular 
   mobile networks based upon IETF protocols. 3GPP does not embrace 
   Mobile IP for support of Mobile IP routeing, it uses an enhanced 
   version of the HLR/VLR mechanism from cellular telephony. However, 
   both 3GPP2 and MWIF have embraced Mobile IP for handling IP 
   routeing, plus AAA and IPv6 for the handling of registration & de-
   registration. 
 

 Wireless Internet Framework Requirements 

   When defining a wireless Internet framework it is necessary to 
   recognise that:  
   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
   * it is compliant with the architectural principles of the Internet 
   [RFC1958]  
   * radio spectrum is a scarce and limited resource and that use of IP 
   based signalling and transport in the RAN and over the radio 
   interface should respect the needs for efficient use of radio 
   spectrum 
   * it is necessary to take measures to ensure spectral efficiency 
   over the radio interface and that ways of reducing IP overhead, for 
   example by introducing robust header compression are considered 
   * IPv6 will become the dominant protocol, although framework must be 
   capable of inter-working with IPv4 networks and devices. 
 

 Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements 

 
 Mobility Management 

   The three aspects of mobility that needs to be supported within a 
   wireless Internet framework are terminal, session, and personal. 
   These in turn need to be supported by a logical mobility manger. In 
   detail: 

 Terminal Mobility 
   The wireless Internet framework needs to support the ability of a 
   terminal to move within and across network domains while continuing 
   to receive access to services. Terminal mobility needs to be of four 
   types: 
   * Inter-administrative Domain Terminal Mobility: this refers to the 
   ability of the terminal to move across administrative domain 
   boundaries. The terminal may be within any wireless or fixed network 
   * Inter-technology Terminal mobility: this refers to the ability of 
   the terminal to move across technology domain boundaries. 
   * Macro Terminal Mobility: this refers to the ability of the 
   terminal to move across subnet boundaries within the same 
   administrative domain.  
   * Micro Terminal Mobility: this refers to the ability of the 
   terminal to move across internal boundaries of an access network. 
    
   Session Mobility 
   The wireless Internet framework needs to support the ability of the 
   user to maintain sessions, including continuity of Internet sessions 
   (e.g., http, ssl, tcp, telnet, ftp), during any discontinuity in the 
   access network and while changing between terminal devices and/or 
   access technologies. For example,  
   * the user of a mobile terminal needs to be able to transfer a 
   session to a laptop with DSL connection without losing a specific 
   session; 
   * as a session transfers from an IMT-IS-2000 RAN to an 802.11 LAN 
   via handoff from one access network to another, the wireless 
   Internet framework needs to support session continuity both within 
   the core and in interfaces to other networks. 

   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
 Personal Mobility 
   The wireless Internet framework needs to support the ability of a 
   end-user to obtain services in a transparent manner within any 
   network and on any terminal (subject to the limitations of the 
   network and terminal) on the basis of, either personal 
   identification, or the capability of the network to provide those 
   services according to the end-user's service profile. This mobility 
   includes the ability of a service provider to control the services 
   it provides to the end-user in a roamed MISP. (This is also known as 
   end-user Mobility, SIM Roaming or end-user Service Mobility in 
   3GPP/3GPP2.) 

 Mobility Management 
   The wireless Internet framework needs to support a core network 
   mobility management function that enables terminal, session and 
   personal mobility across all access technologies. That is, mobility 
   needs to be supported across heterogeneous networks in addition to 
   homogeneous networks. The mobility management function must be 
   flexible, supporting deployment of new access technologies and 
   upgrading of access networks independent of core network 
   enhancements. The mobility management functionality within the 
   wireless Internet framework shall be hierarchical and independent of 
   other functions within the framework.  
 

 AAA 

   The wireless Internet framework needs to support the traditional 
   'triple A' services, with the additional burden of both mobility and 
   roaming. In detail: 

 Authentication 
   The wireless Internet framework needs to support:  
   * independent authentication of both a user's identity and a 
   terminal's identity 
   * authentication algorithms from GSM & ANSI-41 networks 
   * the capability to allow un-authenticated calls (e.g. to emergency 
   services) 
   * the capability to access user/terminal authentication processes, 
   for e-commerce and other services by way of applications (including 
   3rd party applications). 
   * separate authentication for access network and service network 
   * authentication with entities (e.g. gateways or intranets) in other 
   administrative domains (inter-administrative domain authentication). 

 Authorisation 
   The wireless Internet framework needs to support authorisation for 
   service access independently of authentication. Capabilities are 
   required to support authorisation at the application level. 
   Authorisation needs to be supported to control use of multiple 
   access networks, i.e. once authenticated and authorised on one 
   access network (e.g. GSM), no additional authorisation is required 
   to move to alternative access networks (e.g. IEEE 802.11). 
   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    

 Accounting 
   Accounting is the process, within the wireless Internet framework, 
   by which use of network resources are recorded. An accounting system 
   needs to record network resources used (e.g. packet count), QoS 
   provided (e.g. bandwidth, bearer capabilities) and time and duration 
   of provision of network resources. 
    
   The wireless Internet framework needs to provide an accounting 
   function that allows MISPs to perform billing and auditing functions 
   on individual sessions. The capability needs to exist for a multi-
   tiered, flexible accounting process (recording of resources used by 
   packet/octet/byte count, content, session length, level of QoS 
   provided) that is capable of handling intra-domain and inter-domain 
   accounting. For example, the MISP may adopt multi-tiered billing 
   which may be used to provide revenue sharing among network (or 
   multiple network) providers, content providers, etc., and it is 
   necessary that the accounting records provide sufficient capability 
   for this to be undertaken. Such information needs to be provided via 
   an open interface, e.g. SNMP, to the network and service management 
   functions. 
    
   It is not possible, nor prudent, to identify charging models that 
   MISPs will use for services as part of the provision of the wireless 
   Internet - indeed such information is likely to be commercially 
   confidential. It can, however, be readily acknowledged that MISPs 
   will wish to adapt charging systems as the market evolves, being 
   free to introduce innovative schemes to reflect the deployment of 
   new services. Equally well, while traditional interconnect charges 
   continue to exist for calls connected over the public switched 
   telephone network, it will be necessary to support destination and 
   time dependent charging. 
    
   In detail, MISPs will require basic units of data to support 
   flexibility in the generation of accounting information for example 
   to account: 
   * on the basis of usage of network resources (e.g. QoS, packet count 
   in both directions, duration of connection)  
   * on a non-usage basis (e.g. subscription for a given time) 
   * on the basis of a sessions duration and destination 
   * on a fixed charge basis, (e.g. fixed charge for an SMS message) 
   * on the basis of access to the end service or content (e.g. micro-
   charging) 
   * for both mobile originated and mobile terminated sessions; 
   * separately for certain sessions for which a pre-paid user may have 
   a contract subscription (e.g. WAP services); 
   * for changes in quality of service that may occur during a session; 
   and allow: 
   * mobile terminated sessions where there is no charge to the called 
   party 
   * mobile originated sessions where there is no charge to the calling 
   party 

   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
   * sessions to certain destinations (e.g. emergency services 
   irrespective of the status of the end-user subscription level) 
   * a change in the accounting rate after a given resource usage (e.g. 
   first 50 minutes per day free, thereafter a charge, or first 20 
   Mbytes at $0.05/ Mbyte, after which it is $0.03/ Mbyte) 
   * collection of accounting information as the end-user roams between 
   network domains 
   * the provision of accounting information, in near real-time, 
   detailing all network resources used, necessary for the support of 
   advice of charge services. 
    
   There are a number of special accounting requirements that are a 
   direct result of the developments in mobile cellular operations. 
   These include: 
   * support of both Pre & Post Paid Services: Given that the support 
   of pre-paid end-users is expected to be a significant part of most 
   MISPs business, it is essential that the wireless Internet framework 
   supports pre-paid end-users; in additional to post-paid contract or 
   subscription charging. That is, the wireless Internet framework 
   needs to provide the capability for real-time control of end-user 
   access to network resources dependent on the current level of the 
   individual end-user's subscription. For the end-user accounting 
   information needs to be made available such that the user can access 
   account balance at any time. 
   * prevention of fraud: The generation of accounting information 
   needs to be such as to prevent fraudulent abuse of the accounting 
   system by end-users, hackers or any other party. The framework needs 
   to support the capability to always accurately assign accounting 
   information against the relevant end-user and a particular QoS, 
   irrespective of any attempts that the end-user might make to: hide 
   the identity of the source or destination; pass off the packets as 
   being from another source; disguise the assigned QoS; or otherwise 
   attempt to defraud the MISP. 
   * accuracy, reliability and resilience: In all accounting and 
   charging entities, especially in usage-dependent charging, it is 
   necessary that the records are accurate, are reliably produced and 
   stored, and that the accounting system is resilient to network 
   failures. Emphasis needs to placed upon the accuracy of packet 
   counting, especially in handoff and re-location situations where 
   "duplicate packet counts" have been deducted from the total packet 
   count. Additionally, acknowledging packet loss is inevitable, 
   accounting systems need to ensure that the performance of accounting 
   systems with respect to packet loss is clearly understood.  
 

Naming, Numbering & Addressing 

   The wireless Internet framework must provide the capability to 
   separate IP address (i.e. IPv6) from end-user names (e.g. URL), 
   cellular numbers (e.g. E164 number). The name or number is used to 
   uniquely identify the call parties whereas addresses are used solely 
   to determine routeing of the session. 
    
   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
   Addressing is the link between different network technologies whilst 
   naming and numbering may evolve towards higher level common 
   identification mechanisms covering all communication systems (IP, 
   mobile, fixed). The wireless Internet framework should support such 
   evolution. For example, the wireless Internet framework needs to 
   support: static and dynamic IP addresses for mobile terminals; 
   associating public IP addresses with mobile terminals; associating 
   private IP addresses with mobile terminals; mapping Network Access 
   Identifiers (NAI) to mobile terminals; connection of end-users to 
   private IP networks; and, mapping between end-user number (e.g. 
   E.164) and names (e.g. URLs) with IP addresses. 
    
   Although a called party may be identifiable via different means, the 
   wireless Internet framework should allow the user to be reachable 
   through a given name, independent of their location. 
 

 Policy and Profile Services 

   The wireless Internet framework needs to support the capability to 
   implement business, network and service policy in accordance with 
   the MISPs specified policy rules. As such, the wireless Internet 
   framework needs to support the storage and provisioning of the data 
   necessary for the implementation of these, policies, together with 
   capability to implement the specified network policies. The scope of 
   the network policies should include, provision and support of QoS, 
   interconnection with other networks, provision of, and access to, 
   services and provision of service under varying network load 
   conditions. 
    
   The wireless Internet framework needs to support the capability to 
   store and manage end-user/user profile information. Such profile 
   information may include, but is not limited to: 
   * end-user identity (e.g. names, addresses) 
   * end-user service preferences (e.g. presentation, diversions, 
   barring) 
   * end-user preferences (e.g. language, alerts) 
   * end-user terminal capabilities (e.g. display capabilities, access 
   capabilities) 
   * authorised services 
   * authorised bearer and access capabilities (including QoS) 
   * authorised roaming service capabilities 
 

Service Control                  

   In the wireless Internet framework, all service logic (e.g., 
   providing value-added voice and data services and classical 
   telephony supplementary services) needs to be separated from the 
   session management function. Interaction between service functional 
   entities (e.g. service logic, service creation and service 
   management) and control functional entities (e.g. session 

   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
   management, mobility management, resource management) needs to be 
   supported by open interfaces. 
 

 Directories/Databases 

   Any implementation of the wireless Internet framework should use 
   several parameters including user and device identity, service 
   authorisation, inter-administration business profiles, service 
   profile, location information and policy data. These data needs to 
   operate on database systems that are scaleable to network and end-
   user growth and operate with open interfaces to other functional 
   entities that interact with such data. 
    
   The wireless Internet framework needs to support open interfaces to 
   the various directories and databases, including policy data in 
   order to allow the management by the MISP of: 
   * the end-user and service profiles 
   * management by the end-user of the end-user and service profile 
   (subject to the necessary authentication and authorisation). 
    
   The wireless Internet framework needs to support open interfaces 
   from the applications layer to allow applications controlled read 
   and write access to network directories or databases (e.g. end-user 
   identities, service preferences, terminal capabilities, authorised 
   services and capabilities) subject to appropriate authorisation and 
   authentication in line with MISP policies.  
 

 Open Interface Requirements 

   The wireless Internet framework needs to use open interfaces between 
   any network entities that may be implemented by MISPs/ISPs and 
   manufacturers as separate systems, sub-systems, or network entities. 
   To ensure compatibility with existing cellular mobile networks, the 
   wireless Internet framework needs to provide direct support for open 
   'A' and 'Abis' interfaces within the 3GPP2-RAN and 'Iu', 'Iur' and 
   'Iub' interfaces within the 3GPP-RAN. 
    
   The wireless Internet is likely to be populated with many functional 
   entities and needs to support the separation and independence of 
   logical functions. The separation of these functional entities will 
   allow for an implementation of the wireless Internet framework that 
   maintains the most flexibility and scalability of network entities. 
   To the maximum extent possible the wireless Internet framework needs 
   to require that the following functions be logically separate and 
   independent, both within a logical layer and across logical layers: 
   * session management 
   * mobility management 
   * service control 
   * gateway control 
   * gateways (e.g. access, media and signalling) 

   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
   * authorisation, authentication and accounting - i.e., the 
   traditional AAA function should be separated into their component 
   parts and distributed across the logical layers as appropriate 
   * database systems or Unified Directory System 
   * policy management 
   * resource manager 
   * address management 
    
   For example, session management should be independent of mobility 
   specific information. This allows communication sessions to be 
   transparently maintained irrespective of the movement, location and 
   network connectivity of the terminal or user. The implementation of 
   mobility management within the wireless Internet framework needs to 
   allow the MISP to provide a set of common features across the 
   various access networks. 
    
   The wireless Internet framework needs to support the development and 
   provision of services in a service execution environment, through 
   the support of open interfaces, e.g. APIs, to network resources and 
   databases.  
 

 Common Access Protocol Set (CAPS) 

   The wireless Internet framework needs to be designed to ensure that 
   common protocols can be used with various wireless access 
   technologies (e.g. cdma2000, W-CDMA, wireless LAN, etc.) and 
   wireline access technologies (e.g. xDSL, Cable, Digital Broadcast, 
   etc.). The protocols are required to be independent of access 
   technology. Access technology specific entities in the core network 
   should be discouraged. The wireless Internet framework needs to 
   support: 
   * a unified set of IP centric protocols that can serve as a single, 
   common network framework for all wireless Internet air interface 
   technologies 
   * an access-independent set of protocols that can serve different 
   access network technologies, both wireline and wireless. 
   Independence allows harmonisation of protocols throughout various 
   networks. This is a key design goal as MISP networks expand within, 
   and across, regional boundaries. 
 

Global Alignment                 

   The wireless Internet framework needs to support global access to 
   services regardless of access type and location. In order to ensure 
   the widest level of services for end-users, the wireless Internet 
   framework should support globally accessible services within the 
   capabilities of the terminal, access technology and the MISP, via: 
   * the support of common protocols and open APIs 
   * the support of concepts such as virtual home environment (VHE) 
   * a common representation of user service profiles (e.g., XML) 

   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
   * access to services from any network or server utilising service 
   brokering (i.e. the user can negotiate access to services from home 
   or 3rd party service providers). 
 

 Interoperability with non-IP Networks  

   The wireless Internet framework needs to provide the capability to 
   receive sessions from, and terminate sessions to, circuit switched 
   networks that include public switched and existing cellular mobile 
   networks. The wireless Internet framework needs to provide support 
   for roaming users and roaming terminals (with appropriate multi-mode 
   and multi-band functions). This needs to include roaming between IP 
   based and non-IP based networks. In detail the wireless Internet 
   framework needs to support inter-working with GSM MAP and ANSI-41 
   MAP signalling. 
 

 Quality and Reliability 

   The wireless Internet framework should support management and 
   control of QoS for a wide variety of services at the appropriate 
   places within its framework - recognising that QoS is implemented in 
   many places within both the core and access networks. The wireless 
   Internet framework needs to support QoS bearer capabilities for the 
   following classes: conversational class, streaming class, 
   interactive class, and background class, as defined in ITU-R M.1079. 
   The wireless Internet framework needs to be capable of 
   simultaneously providing multiple QoS levels to different 
   applications within the same terminal. 
    
   The wireless Internet framework needs to provide the means to 
   support end-to-end QoS. That is, it needs to support protocols for 
   the control and negotiation of QoS when interacting with a third 
   party provided service platform (the MISP and application provider 
   are both required to ensure that the network entities under their 
   respective control provide the necessary component of QoS). QoS 
   across administrative boundaries should be enforced by both network 
   techniques and business policy enforcement agreements. 
    
   The wireless Internet framework needs to provide a scaleable QoS. 
   That is, the process used to implement QoS within the framework 
   needs to be capable of the flexible support of additional QoS bearer 
   attributes and the assignment of specific (preferred) values to 
   these attributes in order to address evolving capabilities within 
   the core and access networks. 
    
   The wireless Internet framework should be capable of supporting 
   multiple levels of static QoS (negotiation of parameters before the 
   session set-up) as well as dynamic QoS (negotiation of parameters 
   while the session is in progress).  


   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
 
Reliability            

   Platform, element and system (or sub-system) reliability is driven 
   by a combination of MISP, end-user, and regulatory needs (e.g., 
   support of emergency services). The wireless Internet framework 
   should support the necessary functionality to ensure that the 
   necessary reliability can be achieved. That is, the wireless 
   Internet framework needs to provide the capabilities to support a 
   deployment of network entities such that in the event of the failure 
   of a single entity, the performance of the network is not seriously 
   degraded. 

 
 Security 

   The wireless Internet framework needs to counter security threats 
   including: 
   * Unauthorised access to sensitive data (violation of 
   confidentiality)  
   * Eavesdropping: An intruder intercepts messages without detection. 
   * Masquerading: An intruder hoaxes an authorised user into believing 
   that they are the legitimate system to obtain confidential 
   information from the user; or an intruder hoaxes a legitimate system 
   into believing that they are an authorised user to obtain system 
   service or confidential information. 
   * Traffic analysis: An intruder observes the time, rate, length, 
   source, and destination of messages to determine a user's location 
   or to learn whether an important business transaction is taking 
   place. 
   * Browsing: An intruder searches data storage for sensitive 
   information. 
   * Leakage: An intruder obtains sensitive information by exploiting 
   processes with legitimate access to the data. 
   * Inference: An intruder observes a reaction from a system by 
   sending a query or signal to the system. For example, an intruder 
   may actively initiate communications sessions and then obtain access 
   to information through observation of the time, rate, length, 
   sources or destinations of associated messages on the radio 
   interface. 
   * Unauthorised manipulation of sensitive data (Violation of 
   integrity) 
   * Manipulation of messages: Messages may be deliberately modified, 
   inserted, replayed, or deleted by an intruder 
   * Manipulation of databases: Databases may be deliberately modified, 
   or records deleted by an intruder 
   * Disturbing or misusing services (leading to denial of service or 
   reduced availability) 
   * Intervention: An intruder may prevent an authorised user from 
   using a service by jamming the user's traffic, signalling, or 
   control data. 
   * Resource exhaustion: An intruder may prevent an authorised user 
   from using a service by overloading the service. 
   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
   * Misuse of privileges: A user may exploit their privileges to 
   obtain unauthorised services or information. 
   * Abuse of services: An intruder may abuse some special service or 
   facility to gain an advantage or to cause disruption to the network. 
   * Repudiation: A user or a network denies actions that have taken 
   place. 
   * Unauthorised access to services 
   * Intruders can access services by masquerading as users or network 
   entities. 
   * Users or network entities can get unauthorised access to services 
   by misusing their access rights  
   * Defrauding of accounting system (e.g., Users can pass themselves 
   off as someone else, or hide their identity, in order to avoid 
   billing charges to there account (and pass charges on to other 
   accounts. Users can make the accounting system believe that they are 
   using a quality of service different from the actual one they are 
   using. Users may steal Subscriber Identity Modules (SIMs) or 
   terminals) 
    
   The wireless Internet framework needs to be designed to meet the 
   following security objectives: 
   * ensure that information generated by or relating to a user is 
   adequately protected against misuse or misappropriation; 
   * ensure that the resources and services provided by MISPs and 
   application environments are adequately protected against misuse or 
   misappropriation; 
   * ensure that the security features standardised are compatible with 
   world-wide availability. (There needs to be at least one ciphering 
   algorithm that can be exported on a world-wide basis 
   * ensure that the security features are adequately formulated and 
   standardised to provide effective world-wide interoperability and 
   roaming between different MISPs, as well as preventing misuse or 
   misappropriation of network resources by roaming end-users; 
   * ensure that the level of protection afforded to users and 
   providers of services is better than that provided in contemporary 
   fixed and mobile networks; 
   * ensure that the implementation of current security features and 
   mechanisms can be extended and enhanced as required by new threats 
   and services. 
    
   The wireless Internet framework needs to be designed to support the 
   following security features: 
   * end-user identity confidentiality; 
   * end-user identity authentication; 
   * user data confidentiality on physical connections; 
   * connectionless user data confidentiality; 
   * signalling information element confidentiality 
   * user location confidentiality (unless authorised by the user). 
   Use of these security features is at the discretion of the MISP for 
   its own end-users while on the home network. For roaming end-users, 
   use of these security features is mandatory unless otherwise agreed 
   by all the affected cellular mobile operators 
    
   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
   The wireless Internet framework needs to support: 
   * mutual authentication (end-users, 3rd party services, etc.) 
   * confidentiality 
   * integrity 
   * non-repudiation 
   * encryption (This should be sufficiently flexible to support 
   different algorithms at an appropriate level to satisfy end-user and 
   3rd party needs) 
   * data protection (rights of access, privacy) 
   * fraud information gathering 
    
   The wireless Internet framework needs to support the capability to 
   generate a security log containing information sufficient for after-
   the-fact investigation of loss or impropriety. The security log 
   should, as a minimum, be capable of recording events such as: 
   * all sessions established,  
   * invalid user authentication attempts,  
   * unauthorised attempts to access resources (including data and 
   transactions),  
   * changes in users' security profiles and attributes,  
   * changes in access rights to resources,  
   * changes in the network element security configuration,  
   * modification of network element software. 
   For each such event, the record should, as a minimum, include date 
   and time of event, initiator of the event such as: user-ID, 
   terminal, port, network address, etc., names of resources accessed, 
   and success or failure of the event. 
 

Privicy 
    
   The wireless Internet framework should provide for the protection of 
   the privacy of all information provided by end-users. In particular 
   any information collected in the process of providing service to 
   end-users should not be reveal to any third party without their 
   permission. 
    
 
 Network Service & Session Management 

   The high level requirements for the network and service management 
   of a wireless Internet framework are that it should: 
   * provide the means by which the behaviour and status of the 
   network, or its services, can be known at an acceptable practical 
   level; 
   * be capable of realising network-wide management policies through 
   appropriate translation of policies into device-level abstractions 
   and vice-versa,  
   * be a highly automated network and service management platform with 
   well defined human interfaces, processes, functions, data, and 
   necessary flow through for automation,  
   * be secure and provide means of protecting the network and end-user 
   resources, and data against unauthorised modification by end-users 
   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
   or unauthorised personnel, i.e., it should both provide a means of 
   secure communications with and among management entities, and 
   provide a means of access control to management system objects, 
   etc.,  
   * provide a comprehensive network and service management platform 
   for supporting necessary configuration, performance, fault, 
   security, and accounting/billing management functions over multiple 
   temporal scales (e.g., real-time response, long term maintenance) in 
   accordance with the business practices of MISPs,  
   * strive to remain as "technology independent" as possible, 
   * utilise a common information model for defining the objects, 
   modules, etc., across different management functions as well as 
   different technology platforms, and maintain common databases for 
   managed objects, 
   * be scaleable and allow that the growth of network and service 
   management parallels the expansion of the underlying network and 
   service infrastructure as necessary with minimal disruption in 
   current end-users' services,  
   * be built upon relevant IETF network management protocols (e.g., 
   SNMP, COPS, etc.) within both the core and access networks, and re-
   use relevant ongoing work in other forums to the extent possible,  
   * be interoperable with the network and service management of the 
   Internet as well as those of the cellular mobile networks. 
    
   The functions of a network and service management system can be 
   broadly divided into six specific categories: 
   * Fault Management: including fault detection, reporting and 
   recovery procedures.  
   * Configuration Management: including remote configuration 
   capabilities 
   * Billing Management / Accounting Management: accounting is the 
   process, within the wireless Internet framework, by which use of 
   network resources is recorded and the applicable session detail 
   records (SDRs) passed to the billing system. (The process of 
   charging and billing for use of these network resources is under the 
   control of individual MISPs and is outside the scope of this 
   Internet Draft) 
   * Performance Management: including traffic measurement, congestion 
   detection and reporting 
   * Security Management: whilst security is important within the 
   context of network and service management, security is not specific 
   to this area and is relevant to many areas within the wireless 
   Internet framework. 
   * Session Management: to support the function of session management 
   including the ability to provide session state for both real-time 
   and non real-time associations between two or more entities. 
    
   An important issue that relates to all these tasks is that the 
   wireless Internet framework should support means of network and 
   service management over multiple temporal scales. In principle, a 
   network and service management should support dynamic real-time 
   actions such as reconfiguration through protection switching), 
   quasi-dynamic actions (e.g., several hour time span) such as 
   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
   updating the subscription profiles, and "static" actions such as 
   periodic preparation of end-users' bills. In general, multiple time 
   scales are supported through different applications (i.e., policies) 
   using different subsets of the available information/data. These 
   applications are MISP-specific (probably proprietary too) and are 
   not subject to standardisation, though the network and service 
   management data should contain sufficient information for supporting 
   such applications. In detail the requiremts of each six are:  

 Fault Management 
   This is responsible for detection, isolation and recovery of the 
   network from failures. It also collects information about and 
   manages the errors/faults occurred in and alarms raised by the 
   network and/or its elements. More specifically, the fault management 
   tasks include: Service, network, and element outage reporting 
   * Alarm surveillance, namely, status monitoring, fault detection, 
   correlation and reporting 
   * Fault isolation or localisation through alarm analysis, and their 
   correlation with reported outages and performance degradations 
   * Fault recovery through either requesting the configuration 
   management to reconfigure the network (e.g., re-routeing around the 
   point of failure) or one of its elements (e.g. activating a 
   standby), or, scheduling and dispatching of the repair force 
   * Testing, e.g., performing periodic audits 
   * Trouble administration, i.e. reception of trouble reports from 
   end-users, and responding to them appropriately 
   * Event Monitoring, notifications of events, such as incoming 
   session, or session abandoned. 
  
 Configuration Management  
   This is responsible for network provisioning, end-user profile 
   management and configuration of network elements (e.g., routers, 
   network servers) as well as the relations among them. In a wireless 
   Internet, this module should perform network as well as end-user 
   configuration management tasks. The network configuration management 

   should support: 
   * Reconfiguration and update of network transport, control and 
   service layer elements (e.g., servers, gateways, routers, etc.) in 
   the network as necessary  
   * Management of the address space and the IP address manager  
   * Provision, translation, and enforcement of network wide 
   configuration management policies in co-ordination with other 

   network and service management modules 
   * Network provisioning, including, radio network planning including 
   frequency allocation, cell configurations, "optimal" placement of 
   BTS for maximum coverage, power control, etc., forecasting the 
   traffic growth, and planning and network sizing for growth and 
   upgrading of the RAN and as well as the core, reconfiguration of the 
   RAN or core network topology in response to events and triggers from 


   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
   other network and service management (e.g., fault management, and 
   performance management) modules.  
   * Auto-discovery and inventory of network elements in detail, 
   * Auto-mapping of the network topology, 

   * Automatic configuration and initialisation of the network and its 
   services including the configuration and initialisation of 
   transport, control, and service layer elements, 
    
   The end-user configuration management tasks include but not 
   necessarily limited to 
   * Configuration of end-user terminals upon subscription, including 
   assignment of the terminal ID, end-user ID, IP address, etc. 

   * Preparing the end-user profile and storing it in the profile 
   server 
   * Auto-configuration of end-user terminal as necessary 
   * Updating the end-user profile by the authorised personnel or end-
   user as necessary. 

 Billing Management  
   This is responsible for collection, storage, and processing of all 
   necessary data for billing network services according to the value 
   chain. Specifically billing management performs the following tasks: 
   * Retrieves (or receives), stores, and processes the accounting 
   records from the an accounting service to sort, determine and 
   consolidate each end-user's usage of each subscribed service  
   * Prepares end-users' bills, and collects them 
   * Sets the MISP pricing and charging policies taking into account 
   laws, regulations, MISPs investments and market place conditions, 
   etc.  
   * Handles delinquent accounts through periodic reminders or 
   requesting the configuration manager to suspend subscriptions.  
    
   Billing management, beyond the potential definition of the interface 
   between the accounting service and the billing management system is 
   outside the scope of the work of this memo. 

 Performance Management  
   This comprises of all functions - data collection, analysis, 
   comparison and reporting - necessary to ensure QoS and efficient use 
   of resources in the network. The performance management module 
   provides means of: 
   * Performance quality assurance to set and assess the network QoS 
   policies 
   * Performance monitoring for event correlation and filtering, and 
   threshold crossing alerts 
   * Setting, assessing, and updating of the network traffic management 
   policies, and  
   * Performance analysis to make recommendations on performance 
   improvement, traffic demand forecasting for network expansion, 


   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
   obtain end-user's service and traffic summary, and traffic exception 
   and capacity analysis, and network performance characterisation 
   * Setting network wide quality assurance policies 
   * Translating the quality assurance policies into end-to-end 
   reliability, availability and survivability (RAS) criteria for the 
   network, as well as RAS criteria for network elements; 

 Security Management  
   This is responsible for maintaining the network security 
   infrastructure (e.g., passwords, security credentials). The 
   functions of the security management module include but not limited 
   to 
   * Setting network-wide security policies and data 

   * Preventing security breaches through restricting access of 
   unauthorised users to management information and capabilities 
   * Detecting security breaches such as unauthorised access, 
   corruption of data, end-user fraud, and unauthorised actions through 
   security alarm surveillance, traffic monitoring, and monitoring of 
   end-users usage patterns  
   * Containing the damage to the network and users through isolating 

   viruses that corrupt the data as well as revoking unruly end-users' 
   privileges to prevent them from performing certain activities  
   * Managing, establishing, and updating security infrastructure, 
   credentials and privileges, e.g., key management, frequent password 
   updates, and maintaining password files  
   * Performing regular audits to detect breaches, contain them, 
   restore the services and re-instate integrity of the network. 
 

 Over-the-Air Service Provisioning (OTASP) 

   The wireless Internet framework needs to support 'over the air' 
   activation and provisioning of services, such as terminal code 
   download of preferred roaming lists, configuration of software 
   defined radio (SDR), etc. The wireless Internet framework needs to 
   support over the air parameter administration (e.g. mobile 
   identity). 

 
Services         

   The wireless Internet framework needs to support the capability for 
   a wide range of services, including real-time, non-real-time, multi-
   media services. In detail, the wireless Internet framework needs to 
   support: 
   * Real-time speech of a quality no worse than 2G cellular mobile 
   networks (e.g. GSM EFR codec). 
   * Point-to-Multipoint 
   * IP Broadcast, IP Multicast 


   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
   * Multiple concurrent bearer services to the mobile end-user as well 
   as fixed end-user 
   * SMS compatible with current network i.e. point-to-point and cell 
   broadcast 
   * Enhanced SMS, supporting simple text formatting, user-defined 
   pictures, predefined and user defined sounds and animation 
   * Location services (geographic position information) 
   * Acquisition of geographical position information via a variety of 
   techniques, e.g. network position determination equipment, Cell-ID, 
   GPS assisted, depending on the positional accuracy required and the 
   capabilities of the mobile terminal 
   * The transfer of geographical position information to applications 
   to enable provision by the MISP of location-based services 
   * The transfer of geographical position information to emergency 
   services 
   * Personalised Services based on Network Provided Identity 
   * The provision of the network authenticated identity to 
   applications to enable support of personalised services 
   * Calling Line Identification (CLI) services, including CLIP, CLIR 
    
   The requirements of the service interface are: 
   * To provide a common interface between the applications and the 
   underlying network that: is independent of the core network and 
   access network technology; is independent of the specific network 
   configuration; is agnostic to changes in the network configuration; 
   is independent of specific protocols used within the network, and is 
   readily extensible by the MISP to meet specific requirements; 
   * To provide controlled and/or restricted access (via authentication 
   and authorisation) to network resources in line with policies 
   defined by the MISP; 
   * To support the transfer of accounting and billing records between 
   the network and the application in respect of network resources used 
   by that application; 
   * To allow applications to be ported across different networks and 
   to operate consistently across those networks; 
   * To support service registration and discovery procedures, so that 
   an application determine the service interfaces that are available; 
   * To provide a standard, widely understood, interface that 
   encourages the provision of services by different parties. 
    
   In practice there may be several levels or types of service 
   interfaces supported by the network to allow various types of 
   service to be developed. The wireless Internet framework needs to 
   support open interfaces from between the services and transport 
   layers as well as between the control and transport.  
 

Roaming        

   Given that the objective of the wireless Internet framework is to 
   support service provision to roaming end-users from their home MISP, 
   it needs to be possible for the home MISP to: 

   Mobile Internet Service Provider (MISP) Requirements for a Wireless 
   Internet Framework (WIF)    May 2001 
                                    
   * Control access to services depending on the location of the user, 
   and roamed MISP 
   * Control access to services on a per user basis e.g. subject to 
   subscription 
   * Control access to services depending on available service 
   capabilities both in the roamed MISP and in the terminals 
   * Manage service delivery based on for example end-to-end 
   capabilities and user preferences 
   * Request version of specific services supported in roamed MISP and 
   terminal 
   * Request details (e.g. protocol versions and API versions) of 
   available service capabilities supported in the roamed MISP, and 
   terminals; 
   * Define the scope for management of services by the user, for 
   services provided by the home MISP 
   * Inform the roamed MISP of the type of charging (i.e. prepaid 
   or/and post-paid) for any required service 
   * Inform the roamed MISP of the threshold set for a given service 
   required by the user and charged on a prepaid account 
   * Inform the roamed MISP how to manage a service for which the 
   threshold has been reached 
   * Manage the prepaid accounts (e.g. increase, decrease the credit, 
   or pass the information to any application which manages the 
   credit); 
   * Deploy services to users or groups of users 
   * Manage provision of services to users or groups of users. 
    
   In supporting service provision via the home MISP, it needs to be 
   possible for the visited MISP to perform the following: 
   * Provide the necessary service capabilities to support the services 
   from the home environment as far as possible 
   * Dynamically provides information on the available service 
   capabilities in the visited network 
   * Provide transparent communication between clients and servers in 
   terminals and networks 
   * Request the charging information (type of charging, threshold for 
   prepaid services and behaviour if the threshold is reached) for any 
   service possibly required by the user 
   * Handle the session according to the instructions received by the 
   home environment regarding charging activities
