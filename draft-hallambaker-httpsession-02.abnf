   If the browser does not specify a Accept-Session header the server
   MAY reject the connection request entirely or fallback to the
   traditional Cookie mechanism as determined by site policy.

   If the service accepts the offer of session management support, it
   includes a Set-session Header in the response specifying the session
   context:

MAC=[Label(,Label)*]  The message authentication algorithms the
      client is willing to support.

Content=[Offer]  Offers or requires the inclusion of the message
      content in the authentication scope.

ContentDigest=[Offer]  Offers or requires the inclusion of the
      message content by means of a content digest in the authentication
      scope.

Start=[Offer]  Offers or requires the inclusion of the message start
      line in the authentication scope.

Request=[Offer]  Offers or requires the use of a Session header in a
      request message.
Response=[Offer]  Offers or requires the use of a Session header in a
      response message.

TLSU=[Offer]  Offers or requires the use of tls-unique TLS chanel
      binding as specified in [RFC5929].

TLSE=[Offer]  Offers or requires the use of tls-server-end-point TLS
      chanel binding as specified in [RFC5929].

Nonce=[Offer]  Offers or requires the use of the nonce response
      replay attack prevention mechanism.

Counter=[Offer]  Offers or requires the use of the counter request
      replay attack prevention mechanism.

Time=[Optional | Required]  Offers or requires the use of the time
      request replay attack prevention mechanism.

Id=[Binary]  The session context identifier in base64 encoding.

Key=[Binary]  The cryptographic key to be used to calculate the
      authentication value in base64 encoding.

MAC=[Label]  The message authentication algorithm to be used to
      calculate the authentication value as defined in [RFC5698] .

Counter=[Decimal]  Specifies the use of the counter replay attack
      prevention mechanism.  The value of the attribute specifies the
      maximum number of permitted streams.

Time=[NTime]  Specifies the use of the time replay attack prevention
      mechanism and the current value of the time value in seconds.

      Servers SHOULD NOT use a time offset from a fixed epoch (e.g. 32
      bit UNIX epoch).

Max-Age=[NTime]  Specifies the number of seconds in which the session
      parameters expire measured from the time at which the request was
      issued.
