      2. otherwise a new 2-hop tuple is created with:

N_addr = Originator Address,

N_2hop_address = the address of the 2-hop neighbor,

N_time = current time + NEIGHB_HOLD_TIME.

MS_addr == Originator Address

MS_time = current time + NEIGHB_HOLD_TIME.

MS_time = current time + NEIGHB_HOLD_TIME

D_time = current time + D_HOLD_TIME.


      3. If there exist some tuple in the topology set where:

T_last == originator address AND
T_last == originator address AND
T_dest == MPR selector address, AND
T_last == originator address,

T_time = current time + TOP_HOLD_TIME.
T_dest = MPR selector address,

T_last = originator address,

T_time = current time + TOP_HOLD_TIME.
