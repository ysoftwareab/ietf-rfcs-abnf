                         WebRTC Statistics API
             draft-singh-xrblock-webrtc-additional-stats-02

Abstract

   This document describes a list of additional identifiers used in

1.  Introduction

   Web-based real-time communication (WebRTC) deployments are emerging
   and applications need to be able to estimate the service quality.  If
   sufficient information (metrics or statistics) are provided to the
   applications, it can attempt to improve the media quality.
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements] specifies a requirement
   for statistics:

   F38   The browser must be able to collect statistics, related to the
         transport of audio and video between peers, needed to estimate
         quality of experience.


   The [I-D.alvestrand-rtcweb-stats-registry] describes a registration
   procedure for metrics reported by the Javascript API.  It currently
   lists basic metrics reported in the RTCP Sender and Receiver Report
   (SR/RR) to fulfill this requirement.  However, the basic metrics from

Internet-Draft   Additional RTCP XR Metrics for WebRTC     February 2014


   RTCP SR/RR are not sufficient for precise quality monitoring or
   troubleshooting.  This document proposes to expose the RTCP XR
   metrics to complement the identifiers already in the statistics
   registry [I-D.alvestrand-rtcweb-stats-registry].  In depth discussion
   about the XR metrics candidates is carried out in
   [I-D.huang-xrblock-rtcweb-rtcp-xr-metrics].

   The WebRTC application has two options to extract the statistics: 1)
   the browser monitors the local (outgoing) and remote (incoming) RTP
   stream and exposes metrics to the application via the Stats API
   [W3C.WD-webrtc-20130910], or 2) the browser measures the remote
   (incoming) RTP stream and exposes the metrics to the other
   participant by sending the appropriate RTCP XR.  At the moment
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage] does not specify the use of any RTCP XRs
   and since their usage is optional, the exchange of statistics between
   participants or a monitoring server is outside the scope of this
   document.

2.  Candidate XR Block Metrics for WebRTC Statistics API

   This document describes a list of additional identifiers to
   complement the identifiers in Section 4.1 of
   [I-D.alvestrand-rtcweb-stats-registry] and these group of identifiers
   are defined on a ReportGroup corresponding to an SSRC.  In practice
   the application MUST be able to query the statistic identifiers on
   both an incoming (remote) and outgoing (local) media stream.
   Depending on the support of the corresponding XR report the endpoint
   MAY be able to query the reception statistics for its outgoing
   (local) media stream.

   Appendix A (e) of [RFC6958].

   [RFC3611] recommends a Gmin value of 16.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to update the registry described in
   [I-D.alvestrand-rtcweb-stats-registry] with the identifiers defined
   in Section 2.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of
   [I-D.alvestrand-rtcweb-stats-registry], apply.
