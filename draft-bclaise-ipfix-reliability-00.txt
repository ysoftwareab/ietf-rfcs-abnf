 1.     Open Issues 
 
   This section covers the open issues, still to be resolved/updated in 
   this draft. 
    
   1. Investigate the applicability of rserpool for the failover and 
   load-balancing scenario. 
 
 2.     Introduction 
    
   The IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX) protocol serves for 
   transmitting information related to measured IP traffic over the 
   Internet.  The protocol specification in [IPFIX-PROTO] defines how 
   Information Elements are transmitted.  For Information Elements, it 
   specifies the encoding of a set of basic data types. 
    
   The list of Information Elements that can be transmitted by the 
   protocol, such as Flow attributes (source IP address, number of 
   packets, etc.) and information about the Metering and Exporting 
   Processes (packet Observation Point, sampling rate, Flow timeout 
   interval, etc.), is specified in [IPFIX-INFO].

               IPFIX Protocol Specification for billing      August 2005 
 
 
   The IPFIX Working Group went through the process of specifying the 
   requirements for the export of measured IP flow information out of 
   routers, traffic measurement probes, and middleboxes [RFC3917]. While 
   the generic requirements for all application types were specified, 
   the appendix explains the derivation of the requirements from the 
   applications: it expresses the level of requirements (may, should, 
   must), per application, for every single requirement. The following 
   applications were looked at: QoS monitoring, attack/intrusion 
   detection, traffic engineering, traffic profiling, and usage based 
   billing. However, as expressed in the IPFIX Applicability Statement 
   draft [IPFIX-AS], it must be noted that the reliability requirements 
   defined in [RFC3917] are not sufficient to guarantee the level of 
   reliability that is needed for many usage-based accounting systems. 
   Particular reliability requirements for accounting systems are 
   discussed in [RFC2975]. 
    
   This document specifies how the IPFIX requirements and improvements 
   to be suitable for billing applications that require a higher level 
   of reliable. 
    
 2.1      IPFIX Documents Overview 
             
   The IPFIX protocol provides network administrators with access to IP 
   flow information.  The architecture for the export of measured IP 
   flow information out of an IPFIX exporting process to a collecting 
   process is defined in [IPFIX-ARCH], per the requirements defined in 
   [RFC3917].  The IPFIX protocol document [IPFIX-PROTO] specifies how 
   IPFIX data record and templates are carried via a congestion-aware 
   transport protocol from IPFIX exporting processes to IPFIX collecting 
   process.  IPFIX has a formal description of IPFIX information 
   elements, their name, type and additional semantic information, as 
   specified in [IPFIX-INFO].  Finally [IPFIX-AS] describes what type of 
   applications can use the IPFIX protocol and how they can use the 
   information provided.  It furthermore shows how the IPFIX framework 
   relates to other architectures and frameworks.  This document 
   specifies how IPFIX can be made suitable for billing applications 
   that require a higher level of reliable.  
    
 3.    Terminology 
 
   The IPFIX-specific terminology used in this document is defined in 
   section 3 of [IPFIX-PROTO].  As in [IPFIX-PROTO], these IPFIX-
   specific terms have the first letter of a word capitalized when used 
   in this document. As a minimum, the terms defined in the terminology 
   summary table (figure A) are used throughout this document.

 4.    Reliability 
    
 4.1      Requirements 
    
   Billing applications require reliability to ensure that exported Data 
   Records are received by a collector.  
    
   A dedicated mechanism or dedicated mechanisms at the protocol level 
   should allow an extra level of reliability for the Data Records. 
 
 4.2      Choice of the IPFIX Transport Protocol 
 
   The IPFIX Protocol Specification [IPFIX-PROTO] has been designed to 
   be transport protocol independent.  The IPFIX reliability extension 
   required the use of SCTP [RFC2960] using the PR-SCTP [RFC3758] 
   extension.  Refer to [IPFIX-PROTO] for the detailed specification of 
   SCTP in IPFIX. 
    
   [IPFIX-PROTO] specifies that the IPFIX Template Set and Options 
   Template Set MUST be sent over the reliable stream zero.  The IPFIX 
   billing extension imposes that the Data Records MUST also be sent 
   over a reliable stream.  The reliable stream on which the Data 
   Records are sent MAY be the stream zero.  The reliable stream on 
   which the Data Records are sent MAY be another reliable stream than 
   stream zero. 
 
 4.3      Backup and Failover 
 
   If Collecting Process failover is supported by the Exporting Process 
   a second SCTP association MUST be opened in advance. All Templates 
   and Option Templates MUST be sent ahead of time. The SCTP 
   association parameters SHOULD be tuned in order to allow a minimum 
   detection time in case of connection failure. 
    
 
 
  Claise B.                                                   [Page 4] 
               IPFIX Protocol Specification for billing      August 2005 
 
 
   SCTP provides the ability of a sender to retrieve the unacknowledged 
   data when an association fails. Each SCTP API uses various 
   definitions to ask the SCTP interface for this retrieval. An example 
   of this can be found in the SOCKET's API (draft-ietf-tsvg-
   sctpsocket-11.txt) it is called a ÊÊSCTP_SEND_FAILED∆∆ notification. 
   To receive it the sender subscribes to the ÊÊsctp_send_failure_event∆∆ 
   using the socket option SCTP_EVENTS. Each Exporting process should 
   use such a mechanism to receive these send failed notifications. 
    
   After subscribing to the SCTP's API for failure data notifications, 
   an SCTP sender, at the failing of an association to a collector, 
   will be able to retrieve all of the pending data that has been 
   queued to the collector but NOT acknowledged. Each notification 
   comes with the data, and an indication as to if the data was SENT 
   and not acknowledged or if the data was never sent (due to 
   congestion or receiver window limitations). The Exporting process 
   MUST retransmit this information to its backup collector. 
   Information that was never sent can be safely sent to the backup 
   collector just like other new data. Data that as been sent to the 
   previous association but not acknowledged should be processed with 
   care by the backup collector since it is possible that the data was 
   read and processed already by the failed collector. 
 
 5.    Uniqueness 
    
 5.1      Requirements 
    
   Billing applications require a de-duplication mechanism in order to 
   eliminate redundant duplication of Data Records.  They also require a 
   mechanism to uniquely identify Data Records on different Collectors.  
    
   A typical example is an export transport connection failure to the 
   primary Collector, which triggers export to the backup Collector. 
   In order to process all the billing Data Records, the primary 
   Collector must identify whether duplicated Data Records have been 
   received during the transport connection failure, must transfer all 
   the Data Records from the backup Collector, and must eliminate the 
   duplicate ones. 
    
 5.2      Data Records De-duplication and Completeness 
 
   The Collecting Process MUST create an unique packet ID out of the 
   IPFIX Message Export Time, Sequence Number, Source ID, and Exporter. 
      
   The Collector MUST associate every Data Record with this unique 
   packet ID before one of the two following tasks is executed: 
 
 
  Claise B.                                                   [Page 5] 
               IPFIX Protocol Specification for billing      August 2005 
 
 
   - Data Records de-duplication.  
   - Data Records accumulation for other Collector(s) in case of 
   collector failover or partial export to different Collectors. 
    
   The Collector SHOULD check the Data Records de-duplication and Data 
   Records accumulation with other Collectors before executing any 
   record aggregation or filtering. 
    
   Once the de-duplication and accumulation tasks are executed, the 
   unique packet ID associated with the Data Records MAY be discarded.  
    
   Note that the unique packet ID could also be useful for Data Records 
   accumulation in case of duplicate export to two Collectors on the top 
   of UDP, which doesn∆t guarantee the reliable delivery of IPFIX 
   Messages.  
    
 6.    Security 
 
 6.1      Requirements 
    
   Billing applications require security to prevent tampering by 
   ensuring the validity of the received Data Records, while preventing 
   unauthorised access to those Data Records to ensure privacy. 
     
   Proper security mechanisms are needed in order to avoid tampering and 
   eavesdropping.  
 
 6.2      IPsec or TLS 
    
   The IPFIX protocol MUST run on the top of IPsec or TLS [TLS], as 
   specified in [IPFIX-PROTO]. 
  
 7.     Security Considerations 
 
   This draft is an extension the IPFIX protocol specifications.  As 
   such, it does not address new security considerations that were not 
   covered in [IPFIX-PROTO]. 
    
 8.     The Collecting Process∆ side 
    
   After the detection of the SCTP association failure, the primary 
   Collecting Process SHOULD query all the Data Records from the 
   secondary Collecting Process on regular basis, in order to de-
   duplicate the Data Records and to complete the billing records. 
 
   The Collecting Process MUST either process all the Data Records 
   contained into an IPFIX Messages, or MUST not process any of the Data
