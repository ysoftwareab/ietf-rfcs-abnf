2.  Abstract

LDAP is the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, defined  in  [1]  and
[2].   This  document  describes  a  format for an LDAP Uniform Resource
Locator which will allow Internet clients to have direct access  to  the
LDAP  protocol.  While LDAP currently is used only as a front end to the
X.500 directory, the URL format described here is general enough to han-
dle  the  case of stand-alone LDAP servers (i.e., LDAP servers not back-
ended by X.500).

3.  URL Definition

An LDAP URL begins with the protocol prefix "ldap" and is defined by the
following grammar.

    <ldapurl> ::= "ldap://" [ <hostport> ] "/" <dn> [ "?" <attributes>
                        [ "?" <scope> "?" <filter> ] ]

    <hostport> ::= <hostname> [ ":" <portnumber> ]

    <dn> ::= a string as defined in RFC 1485

    <attributes> ::= NULL | <attributelist>

    <attributelist> ::= <attributetype>
                        | <attributetype> [ "," <attributelist> ]

    <attributetype> ::= a string as defined in RFC 1777

    <scope> ::= "base" | "one" | "sub"

    <filter> ::= a string as defined in RFC 1558

The ldap prefix indicates an entry  or  entries  residing  in  the  LDAP
server  running  on the given <hostname> at the given <portnumber>.  The
default port is TCP port 389.  The <dn> is an  LDAP  Distinguished  Name
using  the  string format described in [1], with any URL-illegal charac-
ters (e.g., spaces) escaped using the % method described in RFC 1738.

The <attributes> construct is used to indicate which  attributes  should
be  returned from the entry or entries.  Individual attribute type names
are as defined in RFC 1777.  If the <attributes> part  is  omitted,  all
attributes of the entry or entries should be returned.

The <scope> construct is used to specify the scope of the search to per-
form  in  the  given LDAP server.  The allowable scopes are "base" for a
base object search, "one" for a one-level search, or "sub" for a subtree
search.  If <scope> is omitted, a scope of "base" is assumed.

The <filter> is used to specify the search filter to  apply  to  entries
within  the specified scope during the search.  It has the format speci-
fied in [4], with any URL-illegal characters escaped using the %  method
described   in   RFC   1738.   If  <filter>  is  omitted,  a  filter  of
"(objectClass=*)" is assumed.

Note that if the entry resides in the  X.500  namespace,  it  should  be
reachable from any LDAP server that is providing front-end access to the
X.500 directory.  If the <hostport> part of the URL is missing, the  URL

can be resolved by contacting any X.500-back-ended LDAP server.

4.  Examples

The following are some example LDAP URLs using the format defined above.
An  LDAP  URL  referring  to the University of Michigan entry, available
from any X.500-capable LDAP server:

  ldap:///o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US

An LDAP URL referring to the University of Michigan entry in a  particu-
lar ldap server:

  ldap://ldap.itd.umich.edu/o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US

This URL corresponds to a base object search  of  the  "o=University  of
Michigan,  c=US" entry using a filter of (objectclass=*), requesting all
attributes.

An LDAP URL referring to only the postalAddress attribute of the Univer-
sity of Michigan entry:

  ldap://ldap.itd.umich.edu/o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US?postalAddress

The corresponding LDAP search operation is the same as in  the  previous
example, except that only the postalAddress attribute is requested.

An LDAP URL referring to the  set  of  entries  found  by  querying  any
X.500-capable  LDAP  server and doing a subtree search of the University
of Michigan for any entry with a common name of "Babs Jensen",  retriev-
ing all attributes:

  ldap:///o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US??sub?(cn=Babs%20Jensen)

An LDAP URL referring to all children of the c=GB entry:

  ldap://ldap.itd.umich.edu/c=GB?objectClass?one

The objectClass attribute is requested to be  returned  along  with  the
entries.

5.  Security Considerations

The LDAP URL format does not provide a way to specify credentials to use
when  resolving  the  URL.  Therefore, it is expected that such requests
will be unauthenticated. The security implications of resolving an  LDAP
URL  are the same as those of resolving any LDAP query. See the RFC 1777
for more details.

6.  Prototype Implementation Availability

There is a prototype implementation of the specification defined in this
document  available.   It  is an extension to the libwww client library,
provided in both source and binary forms.  Also included are binary ver-
sions of the Mosaic WWW client for various platforms.  See the following
URL for more details:
