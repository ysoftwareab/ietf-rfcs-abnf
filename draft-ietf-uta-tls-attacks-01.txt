              Summarizing Current Attacks on TLS and DTLS
                     draft-ietf-uta-tls-attacks-01

Abstract

   Over the last few years there have been several serious attacks on
   TLS, including attacks on its most commonly used ciphers and modes of
   operation.  This document summarizes these attacks, with the goal of
   motivating generic and protocol-specific recommendations on the usage
   of TLS and DTLS.

1.  Introduction

   Over the last few years there have been several major attacks on TLS
   [RFC5246], including attacks on its most commonly used ciphers and
   modes of operation.  Details are given in Section 2, but suffice it
   to say that both AES-CBC and RC4, which together make up for most
   current usage, have been seriously attacked in the context of TLS.

   This situation motivated the creation of the UTA working group, which
   is tasked with the creation of generic and protocol-specific
   recommendation for the use of TLS and DTLS.

   "Attacks always get better; they never get worse" (ironically, this
   saying is attributed to the NSA).  This list of attacks describes our
   knowledge as of this writing.  It seems likely that new attacks will
   be invented in the future.

   For a more detailed discussion of the attacks listed here, the
   interested reader is referred to [Attacks-iSec].

2.  Attacks on TLS

   This section lists the attacks that motivated the current
   recommendations.  This is not intended to be an extensive survey of
   TLS's security.

   While there are widely deployed mitigations for some of the attacks
   listed below, we believe that their root causes necessitate a more
   systemic solution.

2.1.  SSL Stripping

   Various attacks attempt to remove the use of SSL/TLS altogether, by
   modifying HTTP traffic and HTML pages as they pass on the wire.
   These attacks are known collectively as SSL Stripping, and were first
   introduced by Moxie Marlinspike [SSL-Stripping].  In the context of
   Web traffic, these attacks are only effective if the client accesses
   a Web server using a mixture of HTTP and HTTPS.

2.2.  BEAST

   The BEAST attack [BEAST] uses issues with the TLS 1.0 implementation
   of CBC (that is, the predictable initialization vector) to decrypt
   parts of a packet, and specifically to decrypt HTTP cookies when HTTP
   is run over TLS.

2.3.  Lucky Thirteen

   A consequence of the MAC-then-encrypt design in all current versions
   of TLS is the existence of padding oracle attacks [Padding-Oracle].
   A recent incarnation of these attacks is the Lucky Thirteen attack
   [CBC-Attack], a timing side-channel attack that allows the attacker
   to decrypt arbitrary ciphertext.

2.4.  Attacks on RC4

   The RC4 algorithm [RC4] has been used with TLS (and previously, SSL)
   for many years.  RC4 has long been known to have a variety of
   cryptographic weaknesses, e.g.  [RC4-Attack-Pau], [RC4-Attack-Man],
   [RC4-Attack-FMS].  Recent cryptanalysis results [RC4-Attack-AlF]
   exploit biases in the RC4 keystream to recover repeatedly encrypted
   plaintexts.

   These recent results are on the verge of becoming practically
   exploitable; currently they require 2^26 sessions or 13x2^30
   encryptions.  As a result, RC4 can no longer be seen as providing a
   sufficient level of security for TLS sessions.

2.5.  Compression Attacks: CRIME and BREACH

   The CRIME attack [CRIME] allows an active attacker to decrypt
   ciphertext (specifically, cookies) when TLS is used with protocol-
   level compression.

   The TIME attack [TIME] and the later BREACH attack [BREACH] both make
   similar use of HTTP-level compression to decrypt secret data passed
   in the HTTP response.  We note that compression of the HTTP message
   body is much more prevalent than compression at the TLS level.

   The former attack can be mitigated by disabling TLS compression, as
   recommended below.  We are not aware of mitigations at the protocol
   level to the latter attack, and so application-level mitigations are
   needed (see [BREACH]).  For example, implementations of HTTP that use
   CSRF tokens will need to randomize them even when the recommendations
   of [I-D.ietf-uta-tls-bcp] are adopted.

2.6.  Certificate Attacks

   There have been several practical attacks on TLS when used with RSA
   certificates (the most common use case).  These include
   [Bleichenbacher98] and [Klima03].  While the Bleichenbacher attack
   has been mitigated in TLS 1.0, the Klima attack that relies on a
   version-check oracle is only mitigated by TLS 1.1.

   The use of RSA certificates often involves exploitable timing issues
   [Brumley03], unless the implementation takes care to explicitly
   eliminate them.

2.7.  Diffe-Hellman Parameters

   TLS allows to define ephemeral Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic Curve
   Diffie-Hellman parameters in its respective key exchange modes.  This
   results in an outstanding attack, detailed in [Cross-Protocol].  In
   addition, clients that do not properly verify the received parameters
   are exposed to MITM attacks.  Unfortunately the TLS protocol does not
   require this verification, see [RFC6989] for the IPsec analogy.

2.8.  Denial of Service

   Server CPU power has progressed over the years so that TLS can now be
   turned on by default.  However the risk of malicious clients and
   coordinated groups of clients ("botnets") mounting denial of service
   attacks is still very real.  TLS adds another vector for
   computational attacks, since a client can easily (with little
   computational effort) force the server to expend relatively large

   computational work.  It is known that such attacks have in fact been
   mounted.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document describes protocol attacks in an informational manner,
   and in itself does not have any security implications.  Its companion
   documents certainly do.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.
