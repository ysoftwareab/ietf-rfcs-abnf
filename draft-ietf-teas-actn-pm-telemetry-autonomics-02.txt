1.  Introduction

   The YANG model discussed in [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang] is used to
   operate customer-driven Virtual Networks (VNs) during the VN
   instantiation, VN computation, and its life-cycle service management
   and operations.  YANG model discussed in [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] is
   used to operate TE-tunnels during the tunnel instantiation, and its
   life-cycle management and operations.

Internet-Draft            VN/TE Perf Monitoring               March 2020


   The models presented in this draft allow the applications hosted by
   the customers to subscribe to and monitor their key performance data
   of their interest on the level of VN [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang] or
   TE-tunnel [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te].  The key characteristic of the
   models presented in this document is a top-down programmability that
   allows the applications hosted by the customers to subscribe to and
   monitor key performance data of their interest and autonomic scaling
   intent mechanism on the level of VN as well as TE-tunnel.

   According to the classification of [RFC8309], the YANG data models
   presented in this document can be classified as customer service
   models, which is mapped to CMI (Customer Network Controller (CNC)-
   Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MSDC) interface) of ACTN [RFC8453].

   [RFC8233] describes key network performance data to be considered for
   end-to-end path computation in TE networks.  Key performance
   indicator (KPI) is a term that describes critical performance data
   that may affect VN/TE-tunnel service.  The services provided can be
   optimized to meet the requirements (such as traffic patterns,
   quality, and reliability) of the applications hosted by the
   customers.

   This document provides YANG data models generically applicable to any
   VN/TE-Tunnel service clients to provide an ability to program their
   customized performance monitoring subscription and publication data
   models and automatic scaling in/out intent data models.  These models
   can be utilized by a client network controller to initiate these
   capability to a transport network controller communicating with the
   client controller via a NETCONF [RFC8341] or a RESTCONF [RFC8040]
   interface.

   The term performance monitoring being used in this document is
   different from the term that has been used in transport networks for
   many years.  Performance monitoring in this document refers to
   subscription and publication of streaming telemetry data.
   Subscription is initiated by the client (e.g., CNC) while publication
   is provided by the network (e.g., MDSC/PNC) based on the client's
   subscription.  As the scope of performance monitoring in this
   document is telemetry data on the level of client's VN or TE- tunnel,
   the entity interfacing the client (e.g., MDSC) has to provide VN or
   TE-tunnel level information.  This would require controller
   capability to derive VN or TE-tunnel level performance data based on
   lower-level data collected via PM counters in the Network Elements
   (NE).  How the controller entity derives such customized level data
   (i.e., VN or TE-tunnel level) is out of the scope of this document.

   The data model includes configuration and state data according to the
   new Network Management Datastore Architecture [RFC8342].

1.1.  Terminology

   Refer to [RFC8453], [RFC7926], and [RFC8309] for the key terms used
   in this document.

   Key Performance Data: This refers to a set of data the customer is
   interested in monitoring for their instantiated VNs or TE-tunnels.
   Key performance data and key performance indicators are inter-
   exchangeable in this draft.

   Scaling: This refers to the network ability to re-shape its own
   resources.  Scale out refers to improve network performance by
   increasing the allocated resources, while scale in refers to decrease
   the allocated resources, typically because the existing resources are
   unnecessary.

   Scaling Intent: To declare scaling conditions, scaling intent is
   used.  Specifically, scaling intent refers to the intent expressed by
   the client that allows the client to program/configure conditions of
   their key performance data either for scaling out or scaling in.
   Various conditions can be set for scaling intent on either VN or TE-
   tunnel level.

   Network Autonomics: This refers to the network automation capability
   that allows client to initiate scaling intent mechanisms and provides
   the client with the status of the adjusted network resources based on
   the client's scaling intent in an automated fashion.

1.2.  Tree diagram

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   Section 5 of this this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these
   diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

1.3.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in Table 1.

                                monitoring

   Some of the key points from
   [I-D.xu-actn-perf-dynamic-service-control] are as follows:

   o  Network traffic monitoring is important to facilitate automatic
      discovery of the imbalance of network traffic, and initiate the
      network optimization, thus helping the network operator or the
      virtual network service provider to use the network more
      efficiently and save the Capital Expense (CAPEX) and the Operating
      Expense (OPEX).

   o  Customer services have various Service Level Agreement (SLA)
      requirements, such as service availability, latency, latency
      jitter, packet loss rate, Bit Error Rate (BER), etc.  The
      transport network can satisfy service availability and BER
      requirements by providing different protection and restoration
      mechanisms.  However, for other performance parameters, there are
      no such mechanisms.  In order to provide high quality services
      according to customer SLA, one possible solution is to measure the
      SLA related performance parameters, and dynamically provision and
      optimize services based on the performance monitoring results.

   o  Performance monitoring in a large scale network could generate a
      huge amount of performance information.  Therefore, the
      appropriate way to deliver the information in the client and
      network interfaces should be carefully considered.

3.  Design of the Data Models

   The YANG models developed in this document describe two models:

   (i)    TE KPI Telemetry Model which provides the TE-Tunnel level of
          performance monitoring mechanism and scaling intent mechanism
          that allows scale in/out programming by the customer.  (See
          Section 3.1 & Section 7.1 for details).

   (ii)   VN KPI Telemetry Model which provides the VN level of the
          aggregated performance monitoring mechanism and scaling intent
          mechanism that allows scale in/out programming by the customer
          (See Section 3.2 & Section 7.2 for details).

3.1.  TE KPI Telemetry Model

   This module describes performance telemetry for TE-tunnel model.  The
   telemetry data is augmented to tunnel state.  This module also allows
   autonomic traffic engineering scaling intent configuration mechanism
   on the TE-tunnel level.  Various conditions can be set for auto-
   scaling based on the telemetry data (See Section 5 for details)

   The TE KPI Telemetry Model augments the TE-Tunnel Model to enhance TE
   performance monitoring capability.  This monitoring capability will
   facilitate proactive re-optimization and reconfiguration of TEs based
   on the performance monitoring data collected via the TE KPI Telemetry
   YANG model.

                                        +--------------+

3.2.  VN KPI Telemetry Model

   This module describes performance telemetry for VN model.  The
   telemetry data is augmented both at the VN Level as well as
   individual VN member level.  This module also allows autonomic
   traffic engineering scaling intent configuration mechanism on the VN
   level.  Scale in/out criteria might be used for network autonomics in
   order the controller to react to a certain set of variations in
   monitored parameters (See Section 4 for illustrations).

   Moreover, this module also provides mechanism to define aggregated
   telemetry parameters as a grouping of underlying VN level telemetry
   parameters.  Grouping operation (such as maximum, mean) could be set
   at the time of configuration.  For example, if maximum grouping
   operation is used for delay at the VN level, the VN telemetry data is
   reported as the maximum {delay_vn_member_1, delay_vn_member_2,..
   delay_vn_member_N}. Thus, this telemetry abstraction mechanism allows
   the grouping of a certain common set of telemetry values under a
   grouping operation.  This can be done at the VN-member level to
   suggest how the E2E telemetry be inferred from the per domain tunnel
   created and monitored by PNCs.  One proposed example is the
   following:

     +------------------------------------------------------------+
     |                      Client                                |

     Delay and              |    |       (Minimum across VN Members)
     Utilized-bw-pecentage  |    |    - VN Delay (Maximum across VN
                           \|/   |     Members)

4.  Autonomic Scaling Intent Mechanism

   Scaling intent configuration mechanism allows the client to configure
   automatic scale-in and scale-out mechanisms on both the TE-tunnel and
   the VN level.  Various conditions can be set for auto- scaling based
   on the PM telemetry data.

   There are a number of parameters involved in the mechanism:

   o  scale-out-intent or scale-in-intent: whether to scale-out or
      scale-in.

   o  performance-type: performance metric type (e.g., one-way-delay,
      one-way-delay-min, one-way-delay-max, two-way-delay, two-way-
      delay-min, two-way-delay-max, utilized bandwidth, etc.)

   o  threshold-value: the threshold value for a certain performance-
      type that triggers scale-in or scale-out.

   o  scaling-operation-type: in case where scaling condition can be set
      with one or more performance types, then scaling-operation-type
      (AND, OR, MIN, MAX, etc.) is applied to these selected performance
      types and its threshold values.

   o  Threshold-time: the duration for which the criteria must hold
      true.

   o  Cooldown-time: the duration after a scaling action has been
      triggered, for which there will be no further operation.

   model is presented in full detail in Sections 6 & 7.

   Let say the client wants to set the scaling out operation based on
   two performance-types (e.g., two-way-delay and utilized-bandwidth for
   a te-tunnel), it can be done as follows:

   o  Set Threshold-time: x (sec) (duration for which the criteria must
      hold true)

   o  Set Cooldown-time: y (sec) (the duration after a scaling action
      has been triggered, for which there will be no further operation)

   o  Set AND for the scale-out-operation-type

   In the scaling condition's list, the following two components can be
   set:

   List 1: Scaling Condition for Two-way-delay

   o  performance type: Two-way-delay

   o  threshold-value: z milli-seconds

   List 2: Scaling Condition for Utilized bandwidth

   o  performance type: Utilized bandwidth

   o  threshold-value: w megabytes

5.  Notification

   This model does not define specific notifications.  To enable
   notifications, the mechanism defined in [RFC8641] and [RFC8640] can
   be used.  This mechanism currently allows the user to:

   o  Subscribe to notifications on a per client basis.

   o  Specify subtree filters or xpath filters so that only interested
      contents will be sent.

   o  Specify either periodic or on-demand notifications.

5.1.  YANG Push Subscription Examples

   [RFC8641] allows subscriber applications to request a continuous,
   customized stream of updates from a YANG datastore.

   Below example shows the way for a client to subscribe to the
   telemetry information for a particular tunnel (Tunnel1).  The
   telemetry parameter that the client is interested in is one-way-
   delay.

   <netconf:rpc netconf:message-id="101"
       xmlns:netconf="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">

   This example shows the way for a client to subscribe to the telemetry
   information for all VNs.  The telemetry parameter that the client is
   interested in is one-way-delay and one-way-utilized- bandwidth.

8.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF users to a preconfigured
   subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and content.  The
   NETCONF Protocol over Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242] describes a method
   for invoking and running NETCONF within a Secure Shell (SSH) session
   as an SSH subsystem.  The Network Configuration Access Control Model
   (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means to restrict access for particular
   NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available
   NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   A number of configuration data nodes defined in this document are
   writable/deletable (i.e., "config true").  These data nodes may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
