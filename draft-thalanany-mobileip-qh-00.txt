1. Abstract 
    
   This draft proposes a scheme to for a quick handoff of a mobile 
   station (MS) from a source packet data-serving node (PDSN) to a 
   target PDSN. The scheme utilizes the information available from the 
   air-interface signaling messages necessary for the hard handoff over 
   the wireless link.  
    
1.1  Problem 
    
   Packets that are destined for the MS, via the source PDSN cannot 
   reach the MS if the MS has changed its attachment point, from a 
   source PDSN to a target PDSN, in the meantime. The Route 
   optimization draft [3] addresses this problem using a network 
   triggered smooth handoff mechanism. For a smooth handoff, the new 
   foreign agent (PDSN) reliably notifies the previous foreign agent 
   (PDSN) about the new mobility binding of the MS when a Registration 
   Request message with the foreign agent notification extension is 
   received from the MS. This information is used by the previous 
   foreign agent (PDSN) to forward the datagrams destined for the MS 
   from the correspondent node to the new foreign agent. The foreign 
   agent extension of Registration request message contains the 
   necessary information required to contact the old foreign agent. The 
   route optimization scheme uses network layer trigger (Registration 
   Request message) to initiate smooth hand over

   process, so it has all the inherent latency problems of existing 
   hand over mechanism which makes it not so suitable for wireless 
   system where low hand over latency is desired.  
    
   This draft describes a link layer assisted quick handoff process for 
   a cdma2000 based cellular system. The proposed scheme may be 
   generalized for any wireless system with low hand over latency 
   requirement.           
    
1.2  Proposed solution 
 
   The quick handoff scheme proposed in this draft solves the problem 
   of performance degradation resulting from packet losses and non- 
   tolerable delay that occur during the handoff of the MS between a 
   source PDSN and a target PDSN. This draft proposes a new interface 
   between the source PDSN and the target PDSN. The quick handoff 
   scheme utilizes the information available via the wireless link 
   layer to assist the handoff of the MS between the source PDSN and 
   the target PDSN at the network layer. The proposed scheme is 
   different from the network layer based handoff schemes.

     Figure 1: Third Generation cdma2000 network with the STP interface 
                
In Figure 1, the traffic between the PDSN and the RNN are transported 
as GRE encapsulated packets over the RP interface. The RNN is 
responsible for handling the traffic to and from the MS over the air-
interface. The RNN contains the RNC and the PCF entities. 
 
The packets that are destined for the MS from the PDSNs cannot reach 
the MS if the MS has changed its attachment from PDSNs to the PDSNt, 
before these packets have been conveyed to the MS via the RP interface 
and the air-interface. 
 
The objective of the proposed quick handoff scheme is to minimize the 
packet losses and delay as a result of a handoff. This objective is 
realized by acquiring and using the IP address of the PDSNs contained 
in the air-interface signaling necessary to facilitate the hard handoff 
of the wireless link between the RNN and the MS. 
                                             
         
4. Quick handoff scheme 
    
   In a cdma2000 third generation wireless network the PDSN performs 
   the functions of an FA (Foreign Agent) to support the handoff of the 
   MS based on Mobile IP [1]. This section describes the proposed 
   scheme, new extensions and a new interface. 
    
4.1 Acquisition of the PDSNs IP address 
    
   The trigger for the hard handoff of the MS is obtained from the RNN 
   to which the MS is currently attached. The signaling messages 
   necessary to support a hard handoff are based on the IS-2000 
   standard.

                    Mobile/IP Quick Handoff Scheme           July 2000 
 
 
   When the RNN receives an RF signal strength report from the MS, the 
   source RNN may recommend a hard handoff to a target RNN within the 
   serving area of the same MSC (Mobile Switching Center), using the 
   Handoff Required message. In the event of a hard handoff 
   recommendation the source RNN sends the Handoff Required message to 
   the governing MSC. The governing MSC processes the Handoff Required 
   message, and sends the Handoff Request message to the selected 
   target RNN in the vicinity of the migration path of the MS. 
    
   The PDSNs IP address is transferred to the target RNN via the 
   Handoff Required and the Handoff Request messages. 
    
   The target RNN transfers the PDSNs IP address, via the RP interface, 
   to the PDSNt using an extension to the RP signaling protocol. 
    
4.2 Acquisition of packets destined for the MS from the PDSNs 
    
   The PDSNt uses the PDSNs IP address to register with the PDSNs, via 
   the STP interface using a signaling scheme based on the RP signaling 
   protocol. The registration reply from the PDSNs is used to transfer 
   any packets buffered at the PDSNs to the PDSNt.    
    
4.3 Hard handoff signaling extension 
    
   The RNC in the target RNN sends the PDSNs IP address extension as a 
   part of the A9 Setup A8 signaling message defined in the IOS4.0 [2].
