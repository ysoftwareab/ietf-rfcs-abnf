Abstract

   This document defines a terminology for discussing network mobility
   problems and solution requirements. Network mobility arises when a
   router connecting an entire network to the Internet dynamically
   changes its point of attachment to the Internet therefrom causing the
   reachability of the entire network to be changed in the topology.
   Such kind of network is referred to as a mobile network. Without
   appropriate mechanisms, sessions established between nodes in the
   mobile network and the global Internet cannot be maintained while the
   mobile router changes its point of attachment.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Network Mobility Support Terminology          May 2003


 1. Introduction

   Network mobility support is concerned with managing the mobility of
   an entire network which changes its point of attachment to the
   Internet and thus its reachability in the Internet topology. If
   network mobility is not explicitly supported by some mechanisms,
   existing sessions break and connectivity to the global Internet is
   lost.

   This document defines the specific terminology needed to describe the
   problem space we face with network mobility and to edict the
   solutions and the requirements they must comply with. This
   terminology complies with the usual IPv6 terminology [RFC2460] and
   the generic mobility-related terms already defined in [Mobility] and
   in the Mobile IPv6 [MIPv6] specifications. Some terms introduced in
   the present version of the draft may only be useful for the purpose
   of defining the problem scope and functional requirements of network
   mobility support and shall be removed or refined once we agree on the
   requirements.

   The first section introduces terms to define the architecture
   components; the second introduces terms to discuss the requirements,
   the third, terms to discuss nested mobility; the forth defines
   multihoming, and the last, miscellaneous terms which do not fit in
   either sections. The overall terminology is summarized in fig.1 to 5.
   Fig.1 shows a single mobile subnetwork. Fig.2. shows a larger mobile
   network comprising several subnetworks, attached on a foreign link.
   Fig.3 illustrates a node changing its point of attachment within the
   mobile network. Fig.4 and 5 illustrate nested mobility whereas Fig.6
   to Fig.8 illustrate multihoming.

 2. Architecture Components

   Fig.1 and 2 illustrate the architecture components involved in
   network mobility. The terms "Fixed Node (FN)", "Mobile Node (MN)",
   "Mobile Network", "Mobile Router (MR)", "Mobile Network Node (MNN)",
   "home link", "foreign link", "ingress interface", "egress interface",
   access router (AR), home link, foreign link are defined in
   [Mobility].

   A mobile network is composed by one or more IP-subnet and is viewed
   as a single unit. It is connected to the Internet by means of mobile
   routers (MRs). Nodes behind the MR primarily comprise fixed nodes
   (nodes unable to change their point of attachment while maintaining
   ongoing sessions), and additionally mobile nodes (nodes able to
   change their point of attachment while maintaining ongoing sessions).
   In most cases, the internal structure of the mobile network will in
   effect be relatively stable (no dynamic change of the topology), but
   this is not a general assumption.

      At the network layer, MRs get access to the global Internet from
      the Access Routers (ARs) on the visited link. The MR maintains the
      Internet connectivity for the entire mobile network. It has one or
      more egress interface(s) and one or more ingress interface(s).
      When forwarding a packet to the Internet the packet is transmitted
      upstream through one of the MR's egress interfaces to the AR; when
      forwarding a packet from the AR down to the mobile network, the
      packet is transmitted downstream through one of the MR's ingress
      interfaces.

 3. Functional Terms

   Within the term Mobile Network Node (MNN), we can distinguish between
   LFN, VMN and LMN. The distinction is a property of how different
   types of nodes can move in the topology and is necessary to discuss
   issues related to mobility management and access control, but does
   not preclude that mobility should be handled differently. Nodes are
   classified according to their function and capabilities with the
   rationale that nodes with different properties (may) have different
   requirements.

   Local Fixed Node (LFN)

      A fixed node (FN), either a host or a router, that belongs to the
      mobile network and which doesn't move topologically with respect
      to the MR.

   Local Mobile Node (LMN)

      A mobile node (MN), either a host or a router who can move
      topologically with respect to the MR and whose home link belongs
      to the mobile network.

   Visiting Mobile Node (VMN)

      A mobile node (MN), either a host or a router who can move
      topologically with respect to the MR and whose home link doesn't
      belong to the mobile network. A VMN that gets attached to a
      foreign link within the mobile network obtains an address on that
      link.

   NEMO-enabled (NEMO-node)

      A node that has been extended with network mobility support
      capabilities and that may take special actions based on that
      (details of the capabilities are not known yet, but it may be
      implementing some sort of Route Optimization).

   MIPv6-enabled (MIPv6-node)

      A node which has been extended with host mobility support
      capabilities as defined in [MIPv6] and that may take special
      actions based on that

 4. Nested Mobility

   Nested mobility occurs when there are more than one level of
   mobility. A MNN acts as an Access Router (AR) and allows visiting
   nodes to get attached to it. There are two cases of nested mobility:

      - when the attaching node is a single node: VMN (see figure 4).
      For instance, when a passenger carrying a mobile phone gets
      Internet access from the public access network deployed into a
      bus.

      - when the attaching node is a router with nodes behind it, i.e. a
      mobile network (see figure 5). For instance, when a passenger
      carrying a PAN gets Internet access from the public access network
      deployed in the bus.

   For the second case, we introduce the following terms:

   Nested Mobile Network

      A mobile network is said to be nested when a mobile network is
      getting attached to a larger mobile network. The aggregated
      hierarchy of mobile networks becomes a single nested mobile
      network.

 5. Multihoming

   Multihoming, as currently defined by the IETF, covers site-
   multihoming [MULTI6] and host multihoming.

   Multihomed Host

      Within host-multihoming, a host may either be:

         - multi-addressed: multiple source addresses to choose between
         on a given interface; all IPv6 nodes are multi-addressed due to
         the presence of link-local addresses on all interfaces.

         - multi-interfaced: multiple interfaces to choose between, on
         the same link or not.

         - multi-linked: multiple links to choose between (just like
         multi-interfaced but all interfaces are NOT connected to the
         same link)

         - multi-sited: when using IPv6 site-local address and attached
         to different sites

   Multihomed Mobile Router

      A MR is multihomed when it has simultaneously more than one active
      connection to the Internet, that is when it is either:

         - multi-egress-addressed MR: the MR has simultaneously multiple
         active addresses to choose between on a given egress interface

         - multi-egress-interfaced MR: the MR has simultaneously
         multiple active egress intefaces on the same link or not

         - multi-egress-linked MR: the MR has simultaneously multiple
         active egress interfaces on distinct links

         - multi-egress-sited MR: the MR is simultaneously attached to
         different sites (possible distinct ISPs).

   Multihomed Mobile Network

      A mobile network is multihomed when there more than one active
      interface connected to the global Internet, that is when either:

         - a MR is multihomed, or

         - mutlti-MR: the mobile network has more than one MR to choose

   Multihomed Nested Mobile Network

      A nested mobile network is multihomed when there more than one
      active interface connected to the global Internet, that is when
      either:

         - a root-MR is multihomed, or

         - multi-root: there are more than one root-MR to choose between

   Illustration

      Fig.6 and 7 show two examples of multihomed mobile networks.
      Fig.8. shows two independent mobile networks. mobile_network_1 is
      single-homed to the Internet through MR1. mobile_network_2 is
      multihomed to the Internet through MR2a and MR2b.

      Let's consider the two following nested scenarios:

         Scenario 1: what happens when MR2a attaches to AR1 ?

            - mobile_network_2 becomes a subservient of mobile_network_1

            - mobile_network_1 is the parent-NEMO (and also the root-
            NEMO)

            - mobile_network_2 is the sub-NEMO

            - MR1 is the root-MR for the aggregated nested mobile
            network

            - MR2a is a sub-MR in the aggregated nested mobile network

            - mobile_network_2 is still multihomed to the Internet, but
            to AR1 and ARz

            - the aggregated nested mobile network is not multihomed


         Scenario 2: what happens when MR1 attaches to AR2 ?

            - mobile_network_1 becomes a subservient of mobile_network_2

            - mobile_network_1 is the sub-NEMO

            - mobile_network_2 is the parent_NEMO (and also the root-
            NEMO)

            - MR2a and MR2b are both root_MRs for the aggregated nested
            mobile network

            - MR1 is a sub-MR in the aggregated nested mobile network

            - mobile_network_1 is not multihomed

            - the aggregated nested mobile network is multihomed

 6. Miscellaneous Terms

   Host mobility support

      Host Mobility Support is a mechanmism which maintains session
      continuity between mobile nodes and their correspondents upon the
      mobile host's change of point of attachment. It could be achieved
      by Mobile IPv6.

   Network Mobility support (NEMO Support)
      Network Mobility Support is a mechanism which maintains session
      continuity between mobile network nodes and their correspondent
      upon a mobile router's change of point of attachment. Solutions
      for this problem are classified into NEMO Basic Support, and NEMO
      Extended Support.

   NEMO Basic Support
      NEMO Basic support is to preserve session continuity by means of
      bidirectional tunneling much like what is done using [MIPv6] for
      mobile nodes.

   NEMO Extended Support
      NEMO Extended support is to provide the necessary optimization,
      including routing optimization between arbitrary MNNs and CNs.

   Node behind the MR
      Any MNN in a mobile network, beside the MRs connecting the mobile
      network to the Internet.

   Correspondent Node (CN)
      Any node that is communicating with one or more MNNs. A CN could
      either be located in the fixed network or within the mobile
      network, and could be either fixed or mobile.

   MNP
      An acronym for Mobile Network Prefix (defined in [Mobility])

   Idle MNN
      A MNN that does not engage in any communication.

   Idle Mobile Network

      A mobile network that does not engage in any communication outside
      the network may be considered idle from the global Internet. This
      doesn't preclude that MNNs are themselves idle. Internal traffic
      between any two MNNs located in the same mobile network is not
      concerned by this statement.

 7. Changes since draft-ernst-nemo-terminology-01.txt

   - removed terms "inter-domain mobility" and "intra-domain mobility".
   Those are replaced with terms "Global mobility" and "Local mobility"
   from [Mobility]

   - removed terms "access router", "mobile network prefix", "home
   subnet prefix", "foreign subnet prefix", "fixed node", "mobile node",
   "mobile network", "mobile network node". "ingress interface", "egress
   interface" to avoid redundancy with [Mobility] where those terms are
   defined.

   - MIPv6-enabled not anymore restricted to the MN Operation

   - removed section "applications" to avoid redundancy with
   [Requirements]

   - more text for multi-homing
