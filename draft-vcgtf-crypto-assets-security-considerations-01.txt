       General Security Considerations for Crypto Asset Exchange
          draft-vcgtf-crypto-assets-security-considerations-01

Abstract

   This document discusses the threat, risk, and controls on the
   followings; Online system of crypto asset exchange that provides the
   exchange service to its customer (consumers and trade partners);
   asset information (including the private key of the crypto asset)
   that the online system of a crypto asset exchange manages; Social
   impact that can arise from the discrepancy in the security measures
   that are implemented in the online system of a crypto asset exchange.

   This document is applicable to the crypto asset exchanges that
   manages the private key that corresponds to crypto asset.  It
   includes the organizations that outsources the key management to
   another organization.  In such a case, the certain recommendations
   applies to those outsourcers.
