Internet-Draft           RSVP recovery signaling          September 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document changes RSVP-TE signaling procedures for [RFC4872] End-
   to-End Recovery and [RFC4873] Segment Recovery.  This document
   contains one fix and one extension.

   The fix is to the problem described in [I-D.rhodes-rsvp-recovery-
   signaling] section 3.1, namely to remove the restriction that Segment
   Recovery repairs can only be be signaled successfully when the merge
   point is at the egress LSR of the protected LSP.

   The extension is for the requirement described in [I-D.rhodes-rsvp-
   recovery-signaling] section 3.2, namely to allow End-to-End and
   Segment Recovery paths to cross addressing domain boundaries.  See
   [RFC5298] section 7 for further information.

   Other problems described in [I-D.rhodes-rsvp-recovery-signaling] are
   not addressed by this document.

2.  Solution Summary

   [RFC4872] End-to-End Recovery use of Association Type 1 is unchanged.

   [RFC4873] Segment Recovery signaling use of Association Type 1
   (Recovery) is deprecated.

   Association Type 3 (Segment Recovery) is introduced for use with
   [RFC4873] Segment Recovery.  Its syntax is the same as Type 2,
   procedures are the same as those for Type 1.

   Association Type 4 (Inter-Domain Recovery) is introduced for use with
   [RFC4872] End-to-End Recovery and [RFC4873] Segment Recovery.  It
   uses generic identifiers in place of router addresses that are
   meaningful only within an addressing domain.

2.1  Reasoning

   This section is explanatory, not normative.

   Association Type 3 can be used to associate LSPs from different
   sessions.  It allows signaling of Segment Recovery paths with merge
   points other than the egress LSR of the protected LSP.  This fixes
   the problem described in [I-D.rhodes-rsvp-recovery-signaling] section
   3.1.

   Association Type 4 can be used to signal associations across domain
   boundaries, including addressing domain boundaries.  Existing
   association types are not suitable for this task, as they contain an

   Association Source that is specified to be an address.  Addresses
   cannot be propagated across addressing domain boundaries.

   This makes possible a variety of inter-domain signaling solutions,
   including ideas similar to path keys.  See [RFC5298] section 7.

2.2  Compatibility

   This section is explanatory, not normative.

   This document makes extensions to the procedures defined in
   [RFC4872].  These extensions are compatible with existing
   deployments.

   This document makes changes to the procedures defined in [RFC4873].
   These extensions are not compatible with existing deployments, if any
   exist.

   It would be possible to entirely deprecate Association Type 1 and
   mandate use of Association Type 3 for all intra-domain associations.
   This is not desirable for reasons of back-compatibility.

3.  ASSOCIATION object

   The ASSOCIATION object is defined in [RFC4872].  [RFC4873] extended
   the use of Association Type 1 and introduced Association Type 2.

   This document replaces the [RFC4873] signaling procedures based on
   Association Type 1, and replaces them with Association Type 3.

   This document also extends the [RFC4872] [RFC4873] signaling
   procedures, allowing use of the alternative Association Type 4, which
   has benefits when recovery paths cross address domains.

3.1  Format

   Association Type: 16 bits

            Value       Type
            -----       ----
              0         Reserved
              1         Recovery
              2         Resource Sharing
              3         Segment Recovery
              4         Inter-Domain Recovery

   This document makes no changes to Types 0 and 2.  This document
   updates the use of Type 1, and introduces Types 3 and 4.

   See [RFC4872] for the definition of other fields and values.

3.2  Association Type 1, Recovery

   Use of Association Type 1 in [RFC4872] procedures is unchanged.

   Use of Association Type 1 in [RFC4873] procedures is deprecated.
   Association Type 1 SHOULD NOT be used for [RFC4873] Segment Recovery.

3.3  Association Type 3, Segment Recovery

   [RFC4873] procedures are updated to use Association Type 3 in place
   of Association Type 1.

   Association Type 3 is used for the same purpose as Association Type
   1, namely to associate a recovery LSP with the LSP that it is
   protecting.

   Association Type 3 syntax is identical with Type 2.  Association
   Source MUST be set to the originating node's router address.  The
   Association ID MUST be set to a value that uniquely identifies the
   association of LSPs among associations from that Association Source.

   Association Type 3 can associate two or more LSPs.  In the case of
   1:N protection with extra-traffic, more than two LSPs will contain
   identical Association Type 3 objects.

3.4  Association Type 4, Inter-Domain Recovery

   [RFC4872] procedures are updated to allow the use of Association Type
   4 in place of Association Type 1.

   [RFC4873] procedures are updated to allow the use of Association Type
   4 in place of Association Type 3.

   Association Type 4 is intended for use where recovery paths cross
   address domain boundaries.  However, Type 4 MAY be used for recovery
   paths that are wholly contained within a single addressing domain.

   Association Source MUST be set to a value that is unique to the
   originating node at all possible merge points, regardless of
   addressing domain.  The Association ID MUST be set to a value that
   uniquely identifies the association of LSPs among associations from
   that Association Source at those merge points.

   Association Source MAY uniquely identify the originating node across
   the entire MPLS network.  Several Association Source idenfifiers MAY
   be assigned to a single node.

Internet-Draft           RSVP recovery signaling          September 2008


   Association Source need not be an IP address.  Either IPv4 or IPv6
   ASSOCIATION objects MAY be used.  An IPv6 ASSOCIATION object SHOULD
   be used for Association Type 4, even when originated from an IPv4-
   addressed domain.

   Association Type 4 can associate two or more LSPs.  In the case of
   1:N protection with extra-traffic, more than two LSPs will contain
   identical ASSOCIATION objects with Association Type 4.

3.4.1  Type 4 Association Source identifiers

   This section is explanatory, not normative.

   This document specifies only the RSVP-TE signaling procedures for
   inter-addressing-domain protection.  This document does not define a
   new address type or identifier for use as a Type 4 Association
   Source.  This document does not define whether such an identifier
   might be originated by management, PCEs, or some other entity.

   This document neither imposes nor denies a requirement to respect
   confidentiality of address domain topology and/or addressing when
   signaling inter-domain protection.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document modifies RSVP-TE signaling.  We assert that no new
   classes of threat are introduced.

   Inter-domain signaling introduces a danger that confidential topology
   information is exported from an addressing domain, perhaps
   implicitly.  This is an existing threat, see [RFC5298] section 7.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign the following values to the "Association
   Types" Registry (see [RFC4872]) in the "ASSOCIATION (object)" section
   of the "RSVP PARAMETERS" registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters.

            Value       Type
            -----       ----
              3         Segment Recovery
              4         Inter-Domain Recovery

   At the time of writing, the existing Association Types assigned by
   [RFC4872] and [RFC4873] do not appear in the RSVP PARAMETERS
   registry.
