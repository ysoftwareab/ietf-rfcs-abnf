1.  Introduction

   This document describes a lightweight key agreement mechanism using
   between 2 and four Diffe-Hellman or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hallman
   keys.  The mechanism may be used establish a shared session key with
   authentication of any or none of the initiator and the responder.

   The approach described is similar to that adopted in the X3DH Key
   agreement [X3DH] used in Signal.

   The objective of the key exchange is limited to establishing a shared
   secret between two mutually authenticated parties that cannot be
   derived by any other parties and cannot be reconstructed by either of
   the parties after the ephemeral contributions have been deleted.

   The key exchange is intended for use as one component in a multi-
   layer security approach in which comprehensive security is provided
   through use of encryption and authentication at multiple layers in
   the protocol stack.

   [[This figure is not viewable in this format.  The figure is
   available at http://prismproof.org/Documents/draft-hallambaker-json-
   key-exchange.html [2].]]


   Multi-layer security

   Specifically, this key exchange is intended for use at the
   presentation layer (e.g. authenticate and encrypt HTTP message
   bodies) to establish keys for authentication and optional encryption
   of messages in Web Service transactions.

   Data Layer  Encryption of cryptographic keys, protocol configuration
      profiles.

   Presentation Layer  Authentication of parties to a Web Service
      transaction.

   Transport Layer  Protect metadata against interception at single
      point on the message path (link or node)

   Link Layer  Protect messages against traffic analysis by means of
      interception at multiple points on the message path

2.  Definitions

   This section presents the related specifications and standard, the
   terms that are used as terms of art within the documents and the
   terms used as requirements language.

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Defined Terms

   No terms of art are defined.

2.3.  Related Specifications

   JSON Key Exchange is used extensively in the Mathematical Mesh and
   related protocols [draft-hallambaker-mesh-architecture] .

2.4.  Implementation Status

   The implementation status of the reference code base is described in
   the companion document [draft-hallambaker-mesh-developer] .

3.  Key Exchange Protocol

3.1.  Parameters

   The following parameters are defined

   Algorithm  The key exchange protocol.  Diffie Hellman in discrete
      log, EdECDH25519 or EdECDH448.[RFC8032]

   Key Derivation Function  The key derivation function.  This is always
      HKDF [RFC5869]

   Key Wrap Function  The Key Wrap function.  This is always RFC3394
      [RFC3394]

   It should be noted that the algorithm described makes use of the
   Edwards form of the curve and not the Montgomery form described in
   [RFC7748] . While these curves are isomorphic, implementations of the
   Montgomery ladder do not lend themselves easily to the approach
   shown.

3.2.  Notation

   The notation adopted in [X3DH] is applied with minor modifications.

   X ||Y  The concatenation of the byte sequence X followed by the byte
      sequence Y.

   KE (PK1, PK2)  The result of performing the key exchange (Diffie-
      Hellman or Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman) with the public
      parameters of PK1 and the private parameters of PK2.

   PK1+PK2  The public, private key pair formed by combining the public,
      private parameters of PK1 and PK2.

Internet-Draft        JSON Web Service Binding v1.0         October 2017


   Expand (PRK, info, L)  The KDF expansion function that derives a key
      of length L bits from the Pre Random Key PRK using the string info
      as the salt.

   Extract (IKM, salt)  The KDF extraction function that derives a Pre-
      Random Key from the Initial Keying Material IKM and the salt value
      salt.  If the salt value is specified as 0, the default salt of a
      string of zero bits the same length as the Pre-Random Key to be
      extracted is used.

3.3.  Roles

   Client  The party that initiates the key exchange

   Service  The party that responds to the key exchange

3.4.  Keys

   C&nbsp;IK  The identification key of the client.  The encoding of
      this key MAY include one or more credentials such as a Mesh
      personal profile or an X.509 certificate binding the key to an
      identity.

   S&nbsp;IK  The identification key of the service.  The encoding of
      this key MAY include one or more credentials such as a Mesh
      personal profile or an X.509 certificate binding the key to an
      identity.

   C&nbsp;EK  The ephemeral key of the client.

   S&nbsp;EK  The ephemeral key of the service.

3.5.  Derived Keys

   The key derivation function is used to derive separate keys for
   different purposes as shown below.  The value L is the number of bits
   requires to key the algorithm specified.  The salt value used to
   derive the PRK from the IKM is either the default salt value (all
   zeros) or the previous Rekey value as described below.

   AK (PRK)  Authentication Key = Expand (PRK, "authentication", L)

   EK (PRK)  Encryption Key = Expand (PRK, "encryption", L)

   RA (PRK)  Rekey Key = Expand (PRK, "rekey", L)

   W (PRK)  Witness value= Expand (PRK, "witness", L)

3.6.  Initial Keying Request

   A key exchange request is either an initial key exchange request or a
   rekeying request.  An initial key exchange request MAY be issued at
   any time but a rekeying request cannot be sent until at least one
   initial keying request has been completed.

   Rekey messages are authenticated under a Rekey shared secret
   established in a previous session.  This may be the immediately
   preceding session or any prior session whose rekey token has not
   expired.

3.6.1.  Initial Request Message

   The client sends their identity and ephemeral key to the service. {
   CIK, CEK }

   If the request message is an initial keying request, a credential
   associated with the identity key MAY be provided.  The request MAY be
   authenticated by means of a digital signature.

3.6.2.  Initial Response Message

   The service calculates the IKM value as follows:

   IKM = KE (CIK + CEK, SIK + SEK)

   PRK = Extract (IKM, 0)

   The service returns the values { SIK, SEK, W(IKM) } in a message
   authenticated under AK(IKM)

3.7.  Rekeying.

   Unless the key agreement is performed to a device of restricted
   capability, rekeying imposes minimal load on client or server and can
   be performed often, particularly if the Ed25519 curve is used for
   rekeying.

   The state required for rekeying is separate from the keys used to
   encrypt and/or authenticate messages.  This allows an application to
   store the rekeying key between communication sessions without risk of
   compromising the confidentiality or integrity of messages.

   The use of the chaining salt ensures that rekeying cannot compromise
   the security of an already established key, even if a weaker key
   exchange algorithm is used.  Thus a client MAY use an Ed488 key to

   perform an initial key exchange and then preform rekey operations
   using a

3.7.1.  Rekeying Request Message

   The client sends a new ephemeral key to the service. { CEK }

   The request message MUST be authenticated under the rekeying key of
   the shared secret of any unexpired session previously agreed.  This
   allows the credentials of the parties to be omitted while providing
   the advantage of establishing a fresh forward secrecy session.

3.7.2.  Rekeying Response Message

   The service calculates the IKM value as follows:

   IKM = KE (CEK, SEK)

   The service returns the values { SEK, W(IKM) } in a message
   authenticated under AK(IKM)

   PRK = Extract (IKM, RA')

   Where RA' is the previous rekeying key output.

3.8.  Initial Key Exchange Example

   Alice requests access to a service using her account identifier
   alice@example.com.  She has already registered her Mesh personal
   profile with the service where it is bound to her account identifier
   as the corresponding credential.

   The Key exchange request is:
