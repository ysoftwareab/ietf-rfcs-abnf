Internet-Draft  Mobile IP MIB Definition using SMIv2 September 26, 2007 
    

1. Introduction 

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the 
   Mobile Node, Foreign Agent and Home Agent of the Mobile IP Protocol. 

   This memo is intended to update and possibly obsolete RFC 2006, 
   however, it is designed to be backward compatible  

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119]. 

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580  
   [RFC2580]. 

3. Structure of the MIB 

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for the use with network management protocols in the Internet 
   community.  In particular, it describes managed objects for the 
   Mobile IP Protocol (MIP), as defined in [RFC3344]. 

3.1. Structure of the Mobile IP 

   This section describes the basic model of Mobile IP used in 
   developing the Mobile IP MIB. This information should be useful to 
   the implementer in understanding some of the basic design decisions 
   of the MIB. 

   The Mobile IP Protocol introduces these new functional entities:

   Mobile Node 

      A host or router that changes its point of attachment from one 
      network or subnetwork to another.  A mobile node may change its 
      location without losing connectivity and without changing its IP 
      address; it may continue to communicate with other Internet nodes 
      at any location using its (constant) IP address, assuming link-
      layer connectivity to a point of attachment is available. 

   Home Agent 

      A router on a mobile node's home network which tunnels packets for 
      delivery to the mobile node when it is away from home, and 
      maintains current location information for the mobile node. 

   Foreign Agent 

      A router on a mobile node's visited network which provides routing 
      services to the mobile node while registered.  The foreign agent 
      detunnels and delivers packets to the mobile node that were 
      tunneled by the mobile node's home agent. For datagrams sent by a 
      mobile node, the foreign agent may serve as a default router for 
      registered mobile nodes. 

   This document specifies the objects used in managing these entities; 
   namely, the Mobile Node, the Home Agent, and the Foreign Agent. 

3.2. MIB Groups 

   Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups.  Each group is 
   organized as a set of related objects.  The overall structure and the 
   relationship between groups and the Mobile IP entities are shown 
   below: 

           Groups            Mobile Node  Foreign Agent  Home Agent 

      MipSystemGroup            X               X             X 
      MipSecAssociationGroup2   X               X             X

      haRegistrationGroup2                                    X 
      haRegNodeCountersGroup2                                 X 
      mipSecNotificationsGroup2                 X             X 

3.3. Protocol Extensions 

   Apart from changes to base specification of Mobile IP [RFC3344], it 
   has been enhanced in number of ways through its ability for added 
   capabilities.  Implementations of those capabilities have not been 
   able to have any management capabilities present in RFC 2006 
   compliant [RFC2006] MIB module agents, since the capabilities 
   themselves postdated the adoption of RFC 2006.  For several 
   significant capabilities, in the form of NAI extension [RFC2794], 
   Challenge/Response Extensions [RFC4721], Reverse Tunneling [RFC3024], 
   Vendor/Organization-Specific Extensions [RFC3115] and Extensions for 
   carrying NAI [RFC3846], the MIB Module defined in this document 
   exposes object types to manage those extended capabilities and their 
   operation. 

   NAI extension requires a thorough redefinition of MIB table row 
   indices from the RFC 2006 state since it provides a one more way to 
   identify the mobile nodes apart from home address.  The functional 
   differences between this memo and RFC 2006 [RFC2006] are explained in 
   Appendix A. 

3.4. Textual Conventions 

   The RegistrationFlags, MipEntityIdentifierType, MipEntityIdentifier, 
   MipEntityIdentifierNAI and MipDeliveryStyle are used as textual 
   conventions in this document.  These textual conventions are used for 
   the convenience of humans reading the MIB.  Objects defined using 
   these conventions are always encoded by means of the rules that 
   define their primitive type.  However, the textual conventions 
   havecspecial semantics associated with them.  Hence, no changes to 
   the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual 
   conventions which are adopted merely for the convenience of readers.

5. Security Considerations 

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations. 

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain 
   sensitive information. These are contained in the 
   mipSecurityAssocTable, mipSecurityViolationTable, faRegVisitorTable, 
   and haMobilityBindingTable. It is thus important to control even GET 
   and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt 
   the values of these object when sending them over the network via 
   SNMP.  

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even 
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even 
   then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed 
   to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this 
   MIB. 

   The Mobile IP MIB affords the network operator the ability to 
   configure and control the Mobile IP links of a particular system, 
   including the Mobile IP authentication protocols, and shared secret 
   key. This represents a security risk. 

   These risks are addressed in the following manners: 

   1. All variables which represent a significant security risk are 
      placed in separate MIB Groups.  By providing Agent Capability 
      Statements, the implementor of the MIB may elect not to implement 
      these groups. 

   2. The MIB allows the manager station to create the security 
      association for Mobile IP entities.  However, the agent should 
      always return 0 length octet string when the manager station 
      retrieves the shared security key in the mipSecAssocTable.  In 
      this way, the Mobile IP entities can prevent the key leaking from 
      SNMP GET, GET-NEXT, or GET-BULK requests.

Internet-Draft  Mobile IP MIB Definition using SMIv2 September 26, 2007 
    

   3. The MIB defines a trap for Mobile IP entities to send a 
      notification to the manager station if there is a security 
      violation.  In this way, the operator can notice the source of an 
      intruder. 

   4. The MIB also defines a table to log the security violations in the 
      Mobile IP entities.  The manager station can retrieve this log to 
      analyze the security violation instances in the system. 

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as 
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned 
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry: 

         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 
         ----------        ----------------------- 

         mipMIB            { mib-2 44 } 

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication):  this draft makes 
   no additional requests of the IANA.

APPENDIX A: Changes from RFC 2006 

   There has been a substantial update of this MIP-MIB since RFC2006. 
   However, sometimes backwards compatibility is preferred over 
   perfection. So, some mib peculiarities still exist in this mib.  

   RFC2006 had some index elements with read access. Although this is 
   not recommended, these index object are not made not-accessible. The 
   non deprecated objects are mnRegAgentAddress and mnRegCOA of row 
   mnRegistrationEntry; and haMobilityBindingMN and haMobilityBindingCOA 
   of row haMobilityBindingEntry. To get a clean compile with smilint, 
   use the "-i index-element-accessible" option.  

   RFC2006 had BITS constructs for RegistrationFlags and the mnAdvFlags 
   that made sense in relation to RFC2002 but was hard to extend to in 
   relation to the bits flags used in RFC3344. The editors have decided 
   that backwards compatibility and not deprecate more objects than 
   necessary is more important than a direct relation to the flags in 
   later MIP RFCs. Extra care should be taken when RegistrationFlags and 
   mnAdvFlags are implemented.  

A.1. Changes in draft-ietf-mobileip-rfc2006bis-00 

      - Section "The Network Management Framework" was updated. 
      - Subsection Protocol Extensions was created under Overview 
        section. 
      -  Section Security Considerations was updated. 
      -  Changes to the MIB definition are following.  Changes are  
         listed in the order of their occurrence in the MIB definition. 
    
      (1)  The textual convention RegistrationFlags was updated.  The  
           bit for VJ compression was removed and bit for reverse  
           tunneling was added. 
    
           Three new textual conventions were added :  
           MipEntityIdentifierType, MipEntityIdentifier and  
           MipEntityIdentifierNAI. These 
           textual conventions were defined to take into account that 
           mobile nodes can be identified by other than ipaddress. 
    
      (3)  New textual convention MipDeliveryStyle was added to  
           represent the delivery style requested by mobile node in the  
           registration request. 
           mipSecAssocTable was deprecated and replaced with  
           mipSecurityAssocTable to support the mobile nodes identified  
           by NAI.  Indices of the table were changed.   
           mipSecurityStatus object was added

           to manage the creation of new security associations in the 
           table.  Default value clause was added to following three 
           objects of the new table. 
           - mipSecurityAlgorithmType 
           - mipSecurityAlgorithmMode 
           - mipSecurityReplayMethod 
    
           hmac was added to the enumeration list of 
           mipSecurityAlgorithmMode object. 
    
      (5)  A new object mipSecurityAssocsCount was added. This gives the 
           number of security associations in the mipSecurityAssocTable. 
    
      (6)  mipSecViolationTable was deprecated and replaced with 
           mipSecurityViolationTable to support the mobile nodes 
            identified by NAI. 
           Indices of the table were changed.The objects corresponding  
           to mipSecRecentViolationIDLow and mipSecRecentViolationIDHigh  
           in the new table are changed to have the syntax of Unsigned32 
           instead of Integer32. 
    
      (7)  Description of the mnHomeAddress object was changed to  
           support dynamic home address assignment and default value  
           clause was added. 
    
      (8)  Two new objects mnIdentifierType and mnIdentifier were added  
           to the mnSystem group. 
    
      (9)  object mnAdvFlags was refined.  The bit for VJ compression  
           was removed and bit for reverse tunneling was added. 
    
      (10) Lower limit of value-range for objects mnAdvMaxRegLifetime  
           and mnAdvMaxAdvLifetime is changed to 1 from 0. 
    
      (11) A new object mnRegDeliveryStyle was added to the mnRegistra- 
           tionTable 
    
      (12) maAdvConfigTable was deprecated and replaced with 
           maAdvertConfTable to support configuration of advertisement  
           parameters on unnumbered interfaces.  
           Index of the table was changed.  A new 
           object maAdvertService was added to maAdvertConfTable to  
           indicate the mobility services offered on the network 
           interface. 
    
      (13) objects faIsBusy and faRegistrationRequired were deprecated,  
           replaced with faAdvertConfTable.  This is to allow for

           torTable to support the visitors identified by NAI.Indices of 
           the table were changed. The objects corresponding to    
           faVisitorRegIDLow and faVisitorRegIDHigh in the new table  
           are changed to have the syntax of Unsigned32 instead of 
           Integer32. 
    
      (16) A new object faRegVisitorDeliveryStyle was added to the 
           FaRegVisitorTable to indicate the delivery style requested by 
           the mobile node. 
    
      (17) A new object faRegVisitorCount was added to count the number  
           of entries in faRegVisitorTable. 
    
      (18) faVJCompressionUnavailable object was deprecated. 
    
      (19) Five new counters specific to reverse tunneling function in

   (5) faNvsesFromMnIgnored is anchored at faRegistration 27  

   (6) faNvsesFromHaIgnored is anchored at faRegistration 28  

   (7) faRegVisitorCount is anchored at faRegistration 29  

   (8) Changed the faCvsesFromHaSupported object name to 
   faCvsesFromHaUnsupported 

   (9) Added faNvsesFromMnIgnored and faNvsesFromHaIgnored to 
   faRegistrationGroup2 

   (10) faRegVisitorTable is anchored at faRegistration 30 

   (11) Added the haNvsesFromMnIgnored object to the 
   haRegistrationGroup2 

   (12) Added the haNvsesFromFaIgnored object to the 
   haRegistrationGroup2 

   (13) Added the NOTIFICATION-GROUP to the imports 

A.4. Changes in draft-ietf-mip4-rfc2006bis-00 

   (1) Draft retitled to draft-ietf-mip4-rfc2006bis-00.txt 

A.5. Changes in draft-ietf-mip4-rfc2006bis-01 

   (1) Chair addresses updated. 

A.6. Changes in draft-ietf-mip4-rfc2006bis-02 

   1) Aligned RegistrationFlags with rfc2006.  

   2) mipEncapsulationSupported OBJECT-TYPE should also contain RFC3519 
   [RFC3519] UDP Tunnel option. Aded new bit to the object since new bit

   is allowed for MIB revision. (RFC 2578, section 10.2 and RFC4181, 
   section 4.9).  

   3) mipSecurityAssocEntry and mipSecurityViolationEntry now contain 
   the full NAI and the address objects. Since the index could be either 
   or, and the NAI could be crippled in the index.  

   4) The error code for a security violation is added. The reason 
   object itself isn't enough (it's almost always other(6). Added 
   mipSecRecentViolationErrorCode to mipSecViolationTable 

   5) maAdvertIfIndex should be InterfaceIndex from IF-MIB, not integer 

   6) With RFC3846, NAI is equally applicable to links and 
   adverticements. So, NAI needs to be included for Mobility agent 
   advertisement interfaces. 

   Added in a group for those that implement agent NAI's a'la RFC3846. 

   7) NAI needs to be added in the FA Visitor table. The NAI isn't 
   necessarily included in the index, and it might also be crippled if 
   it's to long. 

   8) Packet and byte conters per session added. This is a most useful 
   debug-tool, and is also practice in all comparable mibs. They should 
   be kept per registration sessson in the FA and HA. 

   9) HA and NAI information is included in haMobilityBindingTable. 
   There could be many per snmp-agent, so which ha a particular ha 
   session is pertaining to should be incluided in the table. Also, the 
   NAI (as described before) is included. 

   10) haRegRecentServiceDeniedCode can't be enumerated. It's handled by 
   IANA and should therefore be one of the IANA considerations, the 
   sytax is changed to open INTEGER.  

   11) The mipAuthFailure2 notification needs additional objects. Traps 
   should be complete and don't require addditional read operations. the 
   mipAuthFailure2 trap adds objects from hte seviolation table.  

   12) StorageType a'la rfc2579 is added to those tables where they are 
   needed.  

   13) Updated template stuff, such as mib boiler plate, security 
   considerations, references and TC conventions.

A.7. Changes in draft-ietf-mip4-rfc2006bis-03 

   1) No functional changes at all. Updated boilerplate, dates and 
   address information.  

A.8. Changes in draft-ietf-mip4-rfc2006bis-04 

   mnAdvFlags object updated with I [RFC4857] and U [RFC3519] flags. New 
   bits are allowed for MIB revision. (RFC 2578, section 10.2 and 
   RFC4181, section 4.9). 

   Updated security guidelines and reference sections.
