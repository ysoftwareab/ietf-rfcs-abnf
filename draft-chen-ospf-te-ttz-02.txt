Internet-Draft                 OSPF TE TTZ                    March 2016


1.  Introduction

   The number of routers in a network becomes larger and larger as the
   Internet traffic keeps growing.  Through splitting the network into
   multiple areas, we can extend the network further.  However, there
   are a number of issues when a network is split further into more
   areas.

   At first, dividing a network into more areas is a very challenging
   and time consuming since it is involved in significant network
   architecture changes.

   Secondly, the services carried by the network may be interrupted
   while the network is being split into more areas.

   Furthermore, it is complex for a TE LSP crossing areas to be setup.
   In one option, a TE path crossing areas is computed by using
   collaborating PCEs [RFC5441] through PCEP[RFC5440], which is not easy
   to configure by operators since the manual configuration of the
   sequence of domains is required.  Especially, the current PCE
   standard method may not guarantee that the path found is optimal.

   Topology-transparent zone (TTZ) resolves these issues.  This document
   proposes extensions to OSPF protocols to support Traffic Engineering
   (TE) topology-transparent zone.

3.  Overview of Topology-Transparent Zone

   A Topology-Transparent Zone (TTZ) is identified by an Identifier
   (ID), and it includes a group of routers and a number of links
   connecting the routers.  A Topology-Transparent Zone is in an OSPF
   domain.

   The ID of a Topology-Transparent Zone (TTZ) or TTZ ID is a number
   that is unique for identifying an entity such as a node in an OSPF
   domain.  It is not zero in general.

   In addition to having the functions of an OSPF area, an OSPF TTZ
   makes some improvements on an OSPF area, which include:

   o  An OSPF TTZ is virtualized as a group of TTZ edge routers fully
      connected.

   o  An OSPF TTZ receives the link state information about the topology
      outside of the TTZ, stores the information in the TTZ and floods
      the information through the TTZ to the routers outside of TTZ.

   The figure below illustrates an area containing a TTZ: TTZ 600.

                        Figure 1: An Example of TTZ

   The area comprises routers R15, R17, R23, R25, R29 and R31.  It also
   contains TTZ 600, which comprises routers R61, R63, R65, R67, R71 and
   R73, and the links connecting them.

   There are two types of routers in a TTZ: TTZ internal routers and TTZ
   edge routers.  A TTZ internal router is a router inside the TTZ and
   its adjacent routers are in the TTZ.  A TTZ edge router is a router
   inside the TTZ and has at least one adjacent router that is outside
   of the TTZ.

   The TTZ in the figure above comprises four TTZ edge routers R61, R63,
   R65 and R67.  Each TTZ edge router is connected to at least one



Chen, et al.           Expires September 22, 2016               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                 OSPF TE TTZ                    March 2016


   router outside of the TTZ.  For instance, router R61 is a TTZ edge
   router since it is connected to router R15, which is outside of the
   TTZ.

   In addition, the TTZ comprises two TTZ internal routers R71 and R73.
   A TTZ internal router is not connected to any router outside of the
   TTZ.  For instance, router R71 is a TTZ internal router since it is
   not connected to any router outside of the TTZ.  It is just connected
   to routers R61, R63, R65, R67 and R73 inside the TTZ.

   A TTZ hides the information inside the TTZ from the outside.  It does
   not directly distribute any internal information about the TTZ to a
   router outside of the TTZ.

   For instance, the TTZ in the figure above does not send the
   information about TTZ internal router R71 to any router outside of
   the TTZ in the routing domain; it does not send the information about
   the link between TTZ router R61 and R65 to any router outside of the
   TTZ.

   From a router outside of the TTZ, a TTZ is seen as a group of routers
   fully connected.  For instance, router R15 in the figure above, which
   is outside of TTZ 600, sees TTZ 600 as a group of TTZ edge routers:
   R61, R63, R65 and R67.  These four TTZ edge routers are fully
   connected.  The cost of the "link" from one edge router to another
   edge router is the cost of the shortest path between these two
   routers.  The bandwidth of the "link" is the maximum bandwidth of a
   path between the two routers.

   In addition, a router outside of the TTZ sees TTZ edge routers having
   normal connections to the routers outside of the TTZ.  For example,
   router R15 sees four TTZ edge routers R61, R63, R65 and R67, which
   have the normal connections to R15, R29, R17 and R23, R25 and R31
   respectively.


4.  Extensions to OSPF Protocols

   There are a couple of ways in which OSPF protocols are extened to
   support OSPF TE TTZ.  One way is to add a TTZ ID TLV into an existing
   TE LSA.  Another way is to put the contents of an existing TE LSA
   into another opaque LSA with a TTZ ID TLV.

4.1.  Add TTZ ID TLV into Existing TE LSA

   A TTZ ID TLV below, which is defined in OSPF TTZ, is added into an
   existing OSPF TE LSA.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


4.1.1.  Updating TE LSAs for a TTZ Router

   When a TTZ router receives a CLI command triggering TTZ information
   distribution for migration or an LSA containing a TTZ Options TLV
   with T = 1, it knows that distributing TTZ information is started.

   A TTZ router adds a TTZ ID TLV into each of its existing TE LSAs and
   floods the LSAs to its neighbors after distributing TTZ information
   starts.

   When a router inside the TTZ receives a TE LSA containing a TTZ ID
   TLV from a neighboring router in the TTZ, it stores the TE link state
   for the TE TTZ and floods the link state to the other neighboring
   routers.

4.1.2.  Originating TE LSAs for a TTZ Edge Router

   When a TTZ router receives a CLI command activating migration to TTZ
   or an LSA containing a TTZ Options TLV with M = 1, it knows that the
   migration to TTZ is initiated.

   A TTZ edge router originates a TE LSA for a P2P TE "link" to each of
   the other TTZ edge routers after the migration to TTZ starts.  The
   metric of the link is the metric of the shortest path between two
   edge routers within the TTZ.  The bandwidth of the link is the
   maximum bandwidth of a path between the two TTZ edge routers within
   the TTZ.

   The edge router of a TTZ does not distribute any TE LSA with a TTZ ID
   TLV containing the ID of the TTZ to a router outside of the TTZ after
   the migration to TTZ starts.

4.2.  Put an Existing TE LSA in Another LSA

   The TE LSAs about a TTZ describes the TE TTZ topology.  These LSAs
   can be contained and distributed in opaque LSAs within the TTZ.
   These opaque LSAs are called TTZ opaque LSAs or TTZ LSAs for short.

   The following is a general form of a TTZ LSA, which is defined in

   OSPF TTZ.  It has an LS type = 10 and TTZ-LSA-Type, and contains a
   number of TLVs.

   Where a new value (TTZ-TE-LSA-Type) for TTZ TE LSA is introduced for
   TTZ-LSA-Type.

4.2.1.  Originating TTZ TE LSAs for a TTZ Router

   After distributing TTZ information starts, a router in a TTZ
   originates a TTZ TE LSA for each of its existing TE LSAs and floods
   the TTZ TE LSA to its neighbors.  For an existing TE LSA, the TTZ TE
   LSA contains the TLVs in the existing TE LSA and a TTZ ID TLV with
   the ID of the TTZ.

   When a router inside the TTZ receives a TTZ TE LSA from a neighboring
   router in the TTZ, it stores the TE link state for the TTZ and floods
   the link state to the other neighboring routers.

4.2.2.  Originating TE LSAs for a TTZ Edge Router

   A TTZ edge router originates a TE LSA for a P2P TE "link" to each of
   the other TTZ edge routers after the migration to TTZ starts.  The
   metric of the link is the metric of the shortest path between two
   edge routers within the TTZ.  The bandwidth of the link is the
   maximum bandwidth of a path between the two TTZ edge routers within
   the TTZ.

   The edge router of a TTZ does not distribute any TTZ TE LSA to a
   router outside of the TTZ after the migration to TTZ starts.

4.2.3.  Flushing Out TE LSAs for a TTZ Router

   A TTZ router SHOULD flush out its existing TE LSAs after their
   corresponding TTZ TE LSAs are originated and the migration to TTZ is
   done for a short given time such as one minute.

4.3.  Comparison of Two Ways

   The first way seems simple, in which the existing TE LSAs are used.
   In addition, it may use less memory.  However, it is hard to flush
   out the TE LSAs with TTZ ID TLVs after migration to TTZ.

   The second way uses two separated sets of LSAs.  One set is for the
   normal TE topology of a TTZ; the other set is for the TTZ TE topology
   of the TTZ.  Thus it is easy to flush out the normal TE LSAs of the
   TTZ after migration to TTZ.  Moreover, it is cleaner.

   It seems that the second way is preferred since it is cleaner.


5.  Computation of TE Path

   The computation of a TE path on a router outside of a TTZ is the same
   as before.  On a router in a TTZ, the computation of a TE path has
   the same procedure flow as before, with one exception.  A router in a
   TTZ MUST ignore the TE links in the TE LSAs generated by the edge
   routers of the TTZ for virtualizing the TE TTZ.

   A TE path on a router inside the TTZ is computed through using the TE
   link state database (LSDB) containing the TE topology of the TTZ and
   the TE topology outside of the TTZ.


6.  Summarizing TE Information in TTZ

   The Traffic Engineering (TE) information about a TTZ may be
   summarized to the outside of the TTZ as the edges of the TTZ fully
   connected.  The TE link (virtual) between two edges may have the
   maximum bandwidth of a path between them.  The procedure below
   illustrates a way to find the bandwidth for the TE link.

    L1: candidate-list = {{root, MaxBW}}; result-tree = { }.
        Where for edge Ei, root = Ei; MaxBW is a maximum number.

    L2: While candidate-list != { } do

    L3:    Select node with maximum bandwidth from candidate-list
           as working node k;
           remove it from candidate-list; add it into result-tree.

    L4:    Suppose that BWk is the bandwidth of working node k
           (i.e., BWk is the maximum bandwidth from root to node k).
           For each node x connected to node k and not in result-tree,
            find the bandwidth BWx of node x as follows:
            BWx = min{BWk, BWk-x}, where
              BWk-x is the bandwidth of the link from node k to node x.
            If node x is not in candidate-list,
            then add {x, BWx} into candidate-list;
            otherwise (i.e., {x, BWx0} is in candidate-list),
            if BWx > BWx0,
            then replace {x, BWx0} in candidate-list with {x, BWx}.

    L5: end-while

    L6: Maximum bandwidth from Ei to every other edge node Ej is found.

   Note that we should have solutions for summarizing SRLGs and link
   colors for a TTZ, which are challenging.


7.  Security Considerations

   The mechanism described in this document does not raise any new
   security issues for the OSPF protocols.


8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD
