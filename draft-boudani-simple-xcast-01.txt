Abstract

     In this document, we propose a new multicast protocol called 
     SEM (Simple Explicit Multicast) or simple Xcast[1]. This 
     protocol uses an efficient method to construct the multicast 
     tree and deliver multicast packets. 
     In order to construct the multicast tree, this protocol uses
     the same mecanism as Xcast+[2].
     For the delivery of multicast packets it uses the mechanism 
     of branching routers similar to the mechanism used in REUNITE I
     [3] and REUNITE II[4].

1. Introduction

     Recently several multicast mechanisms were proposed that scale 
     better with the number of multicast sessions than traditional 
     multicast does[5].
     Explicit Multicast (Xcast)[1] is a newly proposed multicast scheme 
     to support a very large number of small multicast groups. Xcast+ 
     [2] is an enhanced scheme for the support of receiver initiated 
     join in explicit multicast which complements the existing Xcast. 
     This is achieved by adding an IGMP join at receiver side and 
     sending the join request through source-specific join to the sender,
     and then by explicitly encoding the list of addresses of the 
     multicast routers, instead of receiver addresses. 
     Xcast+ encoding of the destination list in IPv4 and IPv6 are the 
     same as Xcast. Whereas Xcast can support a very large number of 
     small multicast groups, Xcast+ can support a very large number of 
     medium size multicast groups.
     In all the newly proposed protocols the source knows the addresses
     of all the destinations before sending packets. 
     We think that when having medium group size the header processing 
     in every router for all packets travelling from the source to the 
     destinations is very expensive. 
     This document describes a new protocol called Simple Explicit 
     Multicast (SEM) which is an efficient method to construct and 
     forward multicast packets. 
     In order to construct the multicast tree, it uses the same 
     mechanism of Xcast+. Instead, for multicast packets delivery,
     it uses the branching routers mechanism similar to that used in 
     REUNITE II[4]. Packets will be travel from a branching router 
     to another following the tree that have been construted by a 
     control plane that uses the Xcast+ mechanism. 
     Using SEM will result in the following benefits :

     -    From the viewpoint of receivers, procedures in the control
          plane are the same to existing ISM and SSM[7, 8] schemes. 
          Therefore, SEM receivers do not need to use additional 
          control to join in SEM session. This means that the control 
          plane of SEM is compatible with the existing ISM and SSM. 
          A receiver that is an IGMP capable host does not need to be 
          a SEM capable host.

     -    There can be an increase of the number of receivers, which
          means Simple Xcast can support larger size number of 
          members compared to that of existing Xcast and Xcast+. 
          Comparing with Xcast and Xcast+, the packet header

         processing in SEM is minimised and thus, SEM can support 
          larger size number of members.  
          
     -    Similar to ALM (Application Level Multicast) and Overlay
          Multicast schemes, SEM supports both multicast and unicast,
          where multicast is used in subnet and unicast is used between
          branching routers. Therefore, this will result in a more 
          efficient and scalable mechanism that allow to increase the 
          number of receivers in a subnet.

     -    When the scalability in ISM schemes is considered, one of the
          main issues may be complexity of multicast tree construction
          between multicast routers on Internet backbone. Because SEM
          uses the multicast scheme in a subnet level only (the use of 
          the multicast address is so simple in all other cases) , 
          deployment and management are easy and simple, even if 
          multicast scheme is used.

     -    This protocol facilitates the use of MPLS to ensure multicast
          traffic engineering.(see appendix I)

     Note - SEM means the support of receiver initiated IGMP join
     and leave messages, the use of encoded address of the multicast 
     routers in messages used for constructing the multicast tree, and 
     the use of a new message containing the next and the previous hop 
     branching router addresses. Previous hop branching router is the 
     router that has sent the message.

                     PIM-SSM

2. SEM Overview

     In SEM, a receiver (like in Xcast+) initiates IGMP join message 




Boudani & Cousin                                                [Page 3]


INTERNET-DRAFT        Simple Explicit Multicast (SEM)       January 2002


     (Current version of IGMP, IGMPv3[9] can support join of (S, G)). 
     When a multicast router receives the request, it sends source-
     specific join to the sender. 
     The sender keeps track of the addresses of routers that send 
     source-specific join messages in the multicast session.
     The sender encodes the list of router addresses in a BRANCH 
     message. The role of the BRANCH message is to determine routers 
     acting as branching routers in the multicast tree. 
     Branching router in SEM mean a router where a packet arrive in an 
     interface and should be forward to multiple interfaces 
     (according to the next hop toward the destination routers).
     The sender router parses the header, partitions the destinations 
     based on each destination's next hop, and send the BRANCH 
     message to each of the next hops. 
     These procedures comply with the data plane for existing Xcast+ 
     (encoding the addresses of multicast routers in the data packets,
      instead of addresses of receivers).

     For example, suppose that B, C, D, E, F and G are trying to receive
     packets distributed from A in Figure 1 below:


                                B
                               /
                              R4 -- C
                             /                    D
                            /                    /
      A --- R1 --- R2 --- R3                    R8 -- E
                            \                  / \
                             \                /   F
                              R5 --- R6 --- R7
                                              \
                                               \
                                                R9 -- G

                                  Figure 1

     This is accomplished as follows:

     B, C, D, E, F and G initiate IGMP join. When R4, R8 and R9 receive
     the IGMP request, they send source-specific join to A. A sends a 
     BRANCH message with the list of multicast routers (R4, R8 and R9) in
     its SEM header to the first router, R1.
     SEM encoding of the destination list in IPv4 and IPv6 are the
     same as Xcast+. 
     The BRANCH message is encoded like following:

                [IP header | SEM header]
     where IP header contains the source address S and the group 
     address G and SEM header contains the list of all destination
     routers and the address of the previous hop branching router. 
     Therefore, ignoring details, the BRANCH message that A sends to 




Boudani & Cousin                                                [Page 4]


INTERNET-DRAFT        Simple Explicit Multicast (SEM)       January 2002


     R1 looks like following:
     
     [ src = A | group adress = G | dest = R4 R8 R9 
       | previous hop branching router]

     (note that previous hop branching router initial value is the 
     source address S itself).
     When R1 receives this packet, it needs to properly process the
     SEM header of BRANCH message. The processing that a router 
     does on receiving one of these BRANCH messages is as follow: 
     At each router in the path to the destinations, the router checks 
     if it is a branching router for the group (it is a branching 
     router if there are different next hops for the destinations 
     encoded in SEM header of BRANCH message). 
     If all destinations have the same next hop then the router is 
     not a branching node and no further action is taken and the 
     same BRANCH message is forwaded to the unique next hop that 
     has been calculated. If it is not the case and there are 
     multiple next hops for the destinations, then an entry is 
     created at the router indicating that the router is a 
     branching router.
     The entry created at the router contains the source address, the 
     multicast address for the group and the list of unicast addresses 
     for next hop branching routers(the list is empty at the beginning).
     Then the router should send the BRANCH message to each of the 
     next hop branching routers. The same analysis is repeated at 
     each branching router. 
     When a router discovers that it is a branching router (it dicovers 
     that because an entry will be created), it replaces the previous 
     hop branching router field in the BRANCH message with its proper 
     address before resending the BRANCH message. 
     It also sends a PREVIOUS_BRANCH message to the router that its 
     address figure in previous hop branching router field in the 
     BRANCH message.
     The PREVIOUS_BRANCH message received by the previous hop 
     branching router will update the null list at the corresponding 
     entry (S,G) with the address of the next hop branching router 
     (it can be extracted from IP header of the message). 
     If an address to a next hop branching router already exists at 
     the entry then the list should be simply updated and the new 
     address should be added. (for an optimisation issue, the 
     PREVIOUS_BRANCH message will not be generated if there is no 
     changing in the corresponding entry).
     At the end of this operation, we will obtain a path to each 
     destination router using the next hop branching router 
     addresses.
     A BRANCH message is sent periodically to ensure the maintenance 
     of the tree. A timer is associated with the group entry at the 
     source. If a new join message arrived, then a new BRANCH message 
     should be sent and the timer is set to zero.
     It should be noted that another method is to send a BRANCH 
     message containing only the router who sent the last join 




Boudani & Cousin                                                [Page 5]


INTERNET-DRAFT        Simple Explicit Multicast (SEM)       January 2002


     message. In that case, the entries in the branching routers may 
     not change.
     The result of this tree maintenance is that in each branching 
     router an entry corresponding to each group exist. this  
     entry contains the previous and the next hop branching router 
     for that router.
     When the source wants to send a packet to a group, the G entry is 
     examined. The packet is forwarded directly to the next hop
     branching routers in the G entry. The packet is unicast to the 
     next hop branching router with a payload containing the G 
     address(see section 5). 
     When the subsequent branching routers receive the packet, the 
     same operation is repeated. 
     So if the router receiving the packet is not the next hop 
     branching router for that packet then it forwards the packet 
     in unicast to the specific next hop branching router. 
     When the packet arrives at the router in the destination field, 
     (to its next hop branching router), it will be then replicated 
     and sent to each router the next ho branching routers (their 
     addresses figure in the G entry).
     When the packet arrives to the last destination routers, then  
     packet destination field should be replaced with the G address  
     to ensure that it will be delivered throught multicast to all 
     receivers in the subnet.
  
     When a router discovers that there is no recievers, for a group
     in its directly connected subnet, who wants to receive packets 
     from the the source S, it will send a leave message toward the 
     source for the group. A new BRANCH message is generated.
     
     For the use of MPLS : a previous hop branching router in each 
     entry can be added.
     The construction of MPLS LSP should be deduced from the entries.
     This is FFS.
     

3. Control Plane in SEM

     In SEM, a standard multicast address is used to identify a
     multicast session. A sender creates and advertises a multicast
     session with standard multicast address. In order to identify
     SEM session easily, compared with ISM sessions, special multicast
     address range (e.g., similar with the SSM address range, 232/8) 
     can be used. And thus, advertisement method using web pages will 
     be useful. These allocations of SEM multicast addresses and the
     advertisement method of SEM multicast session are outside the
     scope of this document.

     Figure 2 describes the whole control plane for SEM.

3.1. Receiver Considerations

     In SEM, like Xcast+, receivers send IGMP join (or leave) to their 
     multicast router in their subnet they in order to receive SEM
     packets, and then the join requests are sent through source-
     specific join to the sender. It is necessary for receivers to know 
     the address of the sender. Current version of IGMP, IGMPv3 can 
     support source discovery and source-
     specific host membership report. In addition, IGMPv3 leave
     operation is also applicable to leave a multicast session
     dynamically.  That is, SEM receivers don't need to use
     additional control to join or to leave a SEM session. 
     A receiver that is an IGMPv3 capable host does not require 
     modifications to be an SEM capable host. So,this requirement 
     for receivers can be easily achieved.


3.2. Router Considerations

     In SEM, the router that receives the source-specific IGMP host 
     membership report (S, G) sends source-specific join (S, G) to the
     sender. Unlike source-specific join of PIM-SSM, the join message 
     is sent to the sender directly with unicast address using unicast 
     routing,so intermediate routers don't need to keep the state 
     information of the multicast session (S, G).
     The sender obtains the addresses of multicast routers that receive
     source-specific IGMP host membership report for multicast session 




Boudani & Cousin                                                [Page 7]


INTERNET-DRAFT        Simple Explicit Multicast (SEM)       January 2002


     (S, G) from the source-specific joins of SEM. 
     Of course, SEM scheme is extended from Xcast+ and REUNITE II, so 
     all routers on the unicast path between multicast senders and 
     receivers MUST be a SEM capable router to process and forward 
     SEM packets.
     
     Each SEM router should be capable to process BRANCH and 
     PREVIOUS_BRANCH messages. It should also be capable  to create and 
     update group entries.

3.3. Sender Considerations

     In SEM, when a sender receives a source-specific join (S, G), it
     encodes SEM header of the BRANCH message including addresses 
     of routers that have sent source-specific join (S, G). These 
     router addresses are extracted from source addresses of the 
     source-specific join (S, G) packets.
     Encoding method is very similar to that described in Xcast+.
     Unlike receivers, a sender MUST be SEM capable host.
     Also when the sender transmits a packet to a group G, the 
     destination of the packet is the corresponding G entry next hop 
     routers.
     It should be noted that the sender keep the information about 
     the group in an entry that contain the group address and the 
     addresses of all destinations.


4. SEM messages

4.1. BRANCH message

     When the sender receives join messages, the sender explicitly
     encodes the list of addresses of the multicast routers that 
     have received source-specific IGMP host membership report in 
     a BRANCH message.
     The source address field of the IP header contains the address 
     of the sender. The destination address field carries the 
     standard multicast address.
     The list of destinations will be encoded in a separate header.
     the SEM header contains also the previous hop branching router
     field (with initial value the source address S).     
     The IP header will carry the protocol number PROTO_SEM. 
     Like Xcast+, however, sender explicitly encodes the list of 
     addresses of the multicast routers that have sent source-
     specific join message in SEM header.
  

4.2. PREVIOUS_BRANCH message
    
     The PREVIOUS_BRANCH is a SEM message sent by a branching router 
     to its previous hop branching router. It is used to inform the 
     the previous hop branching router about the the next hop 




Boudani & Cousin                                                [Page 8]


INTERNET-DRAFT        Simple Explicit Multicast (SEM)       January 2002


     branching router.(the next hop branching router router is the 
     one who sent the message).
     When receiving this message the entry corresponding to the 
     group with G address is modified. The entry is updated with the 
     address of the next hop branching router. 
     This message contain the IP header (the source is the router it 
     self and the destination is the previous branch router). The 
     SEM header of the message contains only the G address.  
    

5. SEM Packet format
     
     Each SEM packet is as follow:
    
       [ IP header | Group address | Transport header | Payload ]
    
    The IP header contains the source address and the destination 
    address of the next hop branch router.
    Join and leave messages could be normal SSM join and leave 
    messages. Thus, in order to not make confusion between SSM 
    and SEM, an interval of addresses could specified to be 
    used only with SEM protocol.

6.  comparaison between ISM, SSM, Xcast, Xcast+, REUNITEII and SEM

6.1. Differences between Xcast+, REUNITE and SEM

     The major difference between Xcast+ and SEM is that Xcast+ encodes
     the list of destinations in each packet while SEM uses this 
     mechanism only with the BRANCH message. 
     In both protocols the packet will follow the unicast path between 
     the sender and the destination but in SEM the packet will 
     follow a unicast path between branching routers. This seems a 
     good solution in order to optimise the header processing in 
     every router.
     REUNITE II uses branching routers also like SEM but there are 
     some diffrences between the two protocols. 
     SEM uses a multicast address to identifie a group of destinations.
     The sender will be able to provide statistics about the 
     destinations. In REUNITE the sender will not be aware about 
     the receivers. It knows only about the first receiver if 
     the next hop router for all recievers is the same.
     In REUNITE, when the first router that already joined a group
     want to leave the group, the tree maintenance will be very 
     complex.
     In comparaison there are larger number of control messages 
     with REUNITE than SEM. 
     In REUNITE, once the tree is constructed, the packets will 
     follow an explicit path from the sender to all destinations. 
     It is not the case with SEM, where the packets should 
     follow only the unicast paths from a branching router to another.
     The join message in SEM is not periodic like in REUNITE. Note

     that if routing is asymmetric, even subsequent refresh join 
     messages can triger BRANCH messages in REUNITE. That is not 
     the case in SEM.
     Finally, since SEM uses the multicast addresses, The control 
     plane of SEM is compatible with the existing ISM and SSM. 

     The Join and leave latency still a major problem with SEM. While 
     Xcast did not specifie any control plane it suggested that 
     using SIP protocol[6] can be integrated as a flexible control 
     plane protocol. Xcast+ has introduced the IGMP model and 
     Source specific join and leave for the receiving routers. 
     We used the same join and leave messages in SEM. 
     Note that if routing is asymmetric, the same limitations figure 
     with REUNITE also.
     This limitations figure because we think that the source 
     should be always aware about the unicast address for every 
     destination. By this way the leave and join messages should
     reach the source and not only the multicast tree.

6.2. Cost Analysis of ISM, SSM, Xcast, Xcast+, REUNITEII and SEM

     Costs of ISM, SSM, Xcast, Xcast+, REUNITE II and SEM 
     schemes can be summarized as described in Table 1. As a 
     result of analysis, while SEM has some control plane 
     overheads compared to Xcast and Xcast+, its cost of packet 
     header processing is minimised. 
     While REUNITE has some advantages, it has a higher protocol 
     complexity and larger number of control messages. 

7. Applicability and Other Considerations

     The application areas for SEM include conferencing, multi-player 
     games, collaborative working, etc., in light of the number of 
     members, however, SEM is very efficient and more scalable and 
     simple than other protocols.

   The SEM protocol draws on a variety of prior work on alternative 
   aproaches to IP multicast, including the Xcast[1], Xcast+[2], 
   REUNITE[3,4,5].

9. Appendices

9.1 Appendix I: Explicit Multicast Using MPLS

   It is quite clear that having a previous hop and next hop in 
   each branching routers all the path from a sender to the 
   destinations will be the first step to MPLS multicast traffic 
   engineering. Once the tree is constructed, the sender will 
   know the egress routers and also the recievers will know 
   about the ingress router (witch is the sender). 
   When a multicast packet arrives at the root of an MPLS multicast 
   tree (the sender), an MPLS label is imposed to the packet. Then 
   at the subsequent hops, the LSR looks up the forwarding table 
   with the incoming label, finds out all the downstream routers and 
   corresponding outgoing labels, makes the duplications, and 
   forwards them to the downstream routers with the outgoing 
   labels. The branching routers should act as the LSRs for the MPLS 
   domain.
   It should be noted that we are not supposing that MPLS will be 
   introduced just to serve multicasting.  
   We are supposing that MPLS will be widely used for unicast and thus 
   it will be normal, since it will exist anyway, to be used for 
   multicast routing at the same networks. 
   
9.2 Appendix II: Manager Router to Construct The Multicast Tree
   
   In [10], we proposed a novel approach to construct multicast trees in
   MPLS networks. We used a special router called NIMS (Network 
   Information Manager System) as a core router that receive join and 
   leave messages from all destinations. This NIMS will calculate the

   multicast tree and then send branch messages to branching node 
   routers. MPLS tunnels will be use for multicast trafic between
   branching node routers. 
   The NIMS scheme could be used also in SEM.
   All join and leave messages could be sent to the NIMS and then this 
   router will calculate the tree and determine the multicast branching
   node routers. This procedure permanently used to keep the tree 
   maintenance.
