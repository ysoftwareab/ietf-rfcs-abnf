1. The SNMP Management Framework 
    
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
   components: 
    
      o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571. 
    
      o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for 
          the purpose of management.  The first version of this Struc- 
          ture of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and 
          described in RFC 1155, RFC 1212 and RFC 1215.  The 
          second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578, 
          RFC 2579 and RFC 2580. 
    
      o   Message protocols for transferring management information. 
          The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called 
          SNMPv1 and described in RFC 1157.  A second version of the 
          SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards 
          track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 
          and RFC 1906.  The third version of the message protocol 
          is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906, RFC 2572 
          and RFC 2574. 
    
      o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The 
          first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats 
          is described in RFC 1157.  A second set of protocol opera- 
          tions and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905. 
    
      o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 
          and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 
          2575. 
    
    
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management 
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
    
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A 
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable 
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of 
   machine-readable information is not considered to change the 
   semantics of the MIB.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 
    
    
2. Overview 
    
   InfiniBand is designed to support block I/O, inter-processor 
   communications, and data communications traffic simultaneously.  An 
   InfiniBand Subnet can be part of a Server Area Network or a Storage 
   Area Network, either of which can be referred to as a _SAN_. 
    
   An InfiniBand subnet is an entity that interconnects InfiniBand 
   ports on end nodes.  It provides transport and forwarding functions 
   allowing ports to communicate with one another over the links that 
   connect them.  All but the smallest subnets will contain one or more 
   Switches to forward packets from link to link.  A Switch can have 
   from one to 255 ports, each connected to a different link. 
    
   This memo shall define objects related to an InfiniBand Switch and 
   its ports.  It is based on Version 1.0 of the InfiniBand 
   specification [1]. 
    
    
2.1. Management View of a Switch 
    
   The InfiniBand Switch MIB is derived from MIBs used to manage Fibre 
   Channel fabrics.  It is felt that Fibre Channel has enough 
   similarities with InfiniBand that it is valuable to incorporate 
   industry and vendor experience from the former to manage the latter. 
    
   One significant difference between Fibre Channel and InfiniBand 
   switches is that implementations of the former began with stand-
   alone products including chassis, environmental monitoring, etc. and 
   only later evolved to imbedded implementations.  In contrast, 
   InfiniBand is expected to deliver both stand-alone products and 
   embedded implementations from the start.  Consequently, there may be 
   ancillary Switch MIB data such as sensor tables that imbedded 
   switches elect not to implement. 
    
   Unlike its Fibre Channel predecessor, the Switch MIB is designed to 
   support management of an entire subnet.  It does this by supporting 
   multiple switch elements within one MIB, and by providing structures 
   to describe the physical connectivity of the switches. 
    
   The Switch MIB is structured to eventually incorporate multiple 
   interconnect technologies that are likely to coexist within a 
   customer site, such as Fibre Channel and storage over IP.  This 
   represents an opportunity for site-wide interconnect management in 
   an integrated manner.  This memo only includes definitions of 
   InfiniBand and Fibre Channel data at this time. 
    
    
   Forbes             Expires December 31, 2001                 Page 4    Internet Draft       InfiniBand Switch MIB            July 11, 2001 
                                    
    
   All InfiniBand nodes including Switches are managed by means of 
   Attributes, which are data structures that can be set and read over 
   any InfiniBand link connected to that node.  Management Attributes 
   are defined in detail in Volume 1 of the Version 1.0 InfiniBand 
   specification [1].  Many of the objects defined in this memo are 
   based on those Attributes. 
    
   The Switch MIB is organized into three sections.  The first section 
   contains MAP-specific objects.  The second section contains SAN-
   based objects.  The third section contains SAN-based SNMP trap 
   registration and SNMP trap definitions. 
    
   Figure 1 is an overview of how SAN-based objects are organized 
   through an inventory table.  The figure does not contain all the 
   tables and variables for IBSWITCH.  However, it shows an exemplary 
   relationship between the inventory table, non-protocol-specific 
   tables such as the sensor table, and protocol-based tables such as 
   the InfiniBand-specific port table. 
    
    
    
   <insert Figure 1 here> 
    
    
    
2.2. MAP-Specific Object Section 
    
   The MAP-specific object section contains MIB information that is 
   neither non-subnet based, or usage or usefulness of the information 
   in SAN setting is questionable.  For example, the Switch MIB 
   contains MIB version information.  It is possible to present Switch 
   MIB version for all switches in the SAN.  However, usefulness of the 
   information is questionable since the type of information available 
   is only dependent on the local MIB version. 
    
2.3. SAN-based Object Section 
    
   The SAN-base object section contains information for all switches in 
   a SAN through the use of unique indexing for these objects.  In 
   order to accomplish this, the Switch MIB uses one level of 
   indirection.  At the top of the section, a table that contains 
   switch names and corresponding unique IDs is defined.  This table is 
   referred as an inventory table.  On all subsequent tables, the first 
   index to be used is identical to the unique ID.  For example, the 
   first table contains gswname.1 and gswid.1 that return "IB switch 0" 
   and "GUID0.IB" respectively.  A subsequent switch sensor table may 
   contain sensorDesc.GUID0.IB.1, which indicates first sensor 
   description on switch "IB switch 0", and a query to the object 
   returns "Temp 1: 25C". 
    
   Certain sections of the MIB are dependent on the underlying fabric 
   protocol.  For example, port-related tables might contain different 
    
   Forbes             Expires December 31, 2001                 Page 5    Internet Draft       InfiniBand Switch MIB            July 11, 2001 
                                    
    
   types of errors for Fibre Channel versus InfiniBand.  Therefore the 
   inventory table also contains information regarding protocol types 
   handled by the interconnect element to flag which protocol-dependent 
   tables are relevant. 
    
2.3. SAN-based SNMP Trap Section 
    
   SNMP traps are typically implemented as a switch-specific feature.  
   When the feature is extended to SAN-based paradigm, it is important 
   to provide the ability to suppress traps being sent.  For example, 
   SNMP management application "A" may be only be interested in traps 
   from subnet "A" and SNMP management application "B" may only be 
   interested in traps from subnet "B".  Since there are many different 
   cases of such occasions, the MIB must provide ways to manage 
   different scenarios properly. 
    
   Therefore, switch list information is also tied to each SNMP trap 
   address configuration to figure out the proper IP address to send 
   the traps to.

   gswInventoryId - RO 
   The object is an index used by gswInventoryTable.  If the 
   gswInventoryType is Fibre Channel switch type, the gswInventoryId 
   refers to the Worldwide Name (WWN) of the switch.  If the 
   gswInventoryType is InfiniBand switch, InfiniBand Router or 
   InfiniBand-Fibre Channel Edge Router, the gswInventoryId refers to 
   the Globally Unique ID (GUID) of the interconnect element.  Since 
   the index corresponds to either the WWN or GUID assigned to each 
   interconnect element, it is unique but may not be contiguous.

          is not accessible by an external port. 
      o   Faulty (4) means the switch is not operational. 
    
   gswAdmStatus - RW 
   The object indicates the desired administrative status of the 
   switch.  A management station may place the switch in a desired 
   state by setting this object accordingly.  The states are as 
   follows: 
      o   Online (1) means set the switch to be accessible by an  
          external port. 
      o   Offline (2) means set the switch to be inaccessible. 
      o   Testing (3) means set the switch to run the built-in test. 
      o   Faulty (4) means set the switch to a 'soft' faulty condition. 
      o   Reboot (5) means set the switch to reboot in 1 second. 
      o   Fastboot (6) means set the switch to fastboot in 1 second.   
   Fastboot would cause the switch to boot but skip over the POST.  
   When the switch is in a faulty state, only three states can be set: 
   Faulty, Reboot, and Fastboot. 
    
   gswSsn - RW 
   The object is the soft serial number of the switch. 
    
   gswBeaconOperStatus - RO

   gswBeaconAdmStatus - RW 
   The object is the desired status of the switch beacon.  When the 
   beacon is set to on the switch indicates, in an implementation-
   dependent manner, that it needs attention.  When the beacon is set 
   to off, switch indicators will be in their normal state. 
    
   gswDiagResult - RO 
   The object indicates the result of the power-on self test (POST) 
   diagnostics.  A result of 1 indicates that the switch is OK.  Any 
   other result needs to be examined based on switch type. 
    
   gswEventTrapLevel _ RW 
   This object specifies the trap level in conjunction with an event's 
   severity level.  When an event occurs and if the severity is at or 
   below the value specified, an SNMP trap is generated. 
    
   gswEventNumEntries _ RO 
   This object specifies the number of events logged in the event log. 
    
   gswPortComTable 
   It is a table that contains common fields for entries of ports on a 
   switching platform. 
    
   gswPortComEntry - RO 
   An entry of the common switch port information table. 
    
   gswPortComSwitchId - RO

5. Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be 
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  
   The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without 
   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations. 
    
    
6. Intellectual Property 
    
   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to 
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in 
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights 
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it 
   has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the 
   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and

   claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances 
   of licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made 
   to obtain a general license or permission for the use of such 
   proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification 
   can be obtained from the IETF Secretariat. 
    
   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any 
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary 
   rights which may cover technology that may be required to practice
