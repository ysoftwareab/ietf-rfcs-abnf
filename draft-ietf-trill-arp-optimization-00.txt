INTERNET DRAFT         TRILL ARP/ND Optimization              April 2015


1 Introduction

   ARP [RFC826] and ND [RFC4861] are normally sent by broadcast and
   multicast respectively. To reduce the burden on a TRILL campus caused
   by these multi-destination messages, RBridges MAY implement an
   "optimized ARP/ND response", as specified herein, when the target's
   location is known by the ingress RBridge or can be obtained from a
   directory. This avoids ARP/ND query flooding.



1.1  Terminology

   The acronyms and terminology in [RFC6325] are used herein. Some of
   these are listed below for convenience with the following along with
   some additions:

   Campus: a TRILL network consisting of TRILL switches, links, and
   possibly bridges bounded by end stations and IP routers. For TRILL,
   there is no "academic" implication in the name "campus".


   APPsub-TLV     Application sub-Type-Length-Values

   ARP            Address Resolution Protocol [RFC826]

   DAD            Duplicate Address Detection

   Data Label     VLAN or FGL

   ESADI          End Station Address Distribution Information [RFC7357]

   FGL            Fine-Grained Label [RFC7172]

   IA             Interface Addresses, a TRILL APPsub-TLV [IA-draft]

   IP             Internet Protocol

   MAC            Media Access Control address

   ND             Neighbor Discoery [RFC4861]

   RBridge        Routing Bridge, an alternative term for a TRILL
   switch.

   Tunneled Routing in the Link Layer.

   TRILL switch   A device implementing the TRILL protocol, an
   alternative term for an RBridge.


2 IP/MAC Address Mappings

   Traditionally an RBridge learns the MAC and Data Label (VLAN or FGL)
   to nickname correspondence of a remote host, as per [RFC6325] and
   [RFC7172], from TRILL data frames received. No IP address information
   is learned directly from the TRILL data frame. Interface Addresses
   (IA) APPsub-TLV [IA-draft] enhances the TRILL base protocol by
   allowing IP and MAC address mappings to be distributed in the control
   plane by any RBridge. This APPsub-TLV appears inside the TRILL
   GENINFO TLV in ESADI [RFC7357] but the value data structure it
   specifies may also occur in other application contexts. Edge
   Directory Assist Mechanisms [DirMech] makes use of this APPsub-TLV
   for its push model and uses the value data structure it specifies in
   its pull model. 

   An RBridge can easily know the IP/MAC address mappings of the local
   hosts that it is attached to it via its access ports by receiving ARP
   [RFC826] or ND [RFC4861] messages. If the RBridge has extracted the
   sender's IP/MAC address pair from the received data packet, it may
   save the information and use the IA APPsub-TLV to distribute it to
   other RBridges through ESADI. Then the relevant remote RBridges
   (normally those interested in the same Data Label as the original
   ARP/ND messages) receive and save such mapping information also.
   There are others ways that RBridges save IP/MAC address mappings in
   advance, e.g. import from management system and distribution by
   directory servers [DirMech]. 

   The examples given above shows that RBridges may have saved a host's
   triplet of {IP address, MAC address, ingress nickname} for a given
   Data Label (VLAN or FGL) before that host sends or receives any real
   data packet. Note such information may or may not be a complete list
   and may or may not exist on all RBridges. The information may
   possibly be from different sources. RBridges can then use the Flags
   Field in IA APPsub-TLV to identify if the source is a directory
   server or local observation by the sender. A different confidence
   level may also be used to indicate the reliability of the mapping
   information.  

3 Handling ARP/ND Messages

   A native frame that is an ARP [RFC826] message is detected by its
   Ethertype of 0x0806. A native frame that is an ND [RFC4861] is
 


Yizhou, et al                                                   [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT         TRILL ARP/ND Optimization              April 2015


   detected by being one of five different ICMPv6 packet types. ARP/ND
   is commonly used on a link to (1) query for the MAC address
   corresponding to an IPv4 or IPv6 address, (2) test if an IPv4/IPv6
   address is already in use, or (3) to announce the new or updated info
   on any of IPv4/IPv6 address, MAC address, and/or point of attachment.
   

   To simplify the text, we use the following terms in this section.

     1) IP address - indicated protocol address that is normally an IPv4
     address in ARP or an IPv6 address in ND.

     2) sender's IP/MAC address - sender protocol/hardware address in
     ARP, source IP address and source link-layer address in ND

     3) target's IP/MAC address - target protocol/hardware address in
     ARP, target address and target link-layer address in ND 

   When an ingress RBridge receives an ARP/ND message, it can perform
   the steps described in the sub-sections below.


3.1 Get Sender's IP/MAC Mapping Information for Non-zero IP 

   If the sender's IP has not been saved by the ingress RBridge before,
   populate the information of sender's IP/MAC in its ARP table;

   else if the sender's IP has been saved before but with a different
   MAC address mapped or a different ingress nickname associated with
   the same pair of IP/MAC, the RBridge should verify if a duplicate IP
   address has already been in use or a host has changed its attaching
   RBridge. The RBridge may use different strategies to do so, for
   example, ask an authoritative entity like directory servers or
   encapsulate and unicast the ARP/ND message to the location where it
   believes the address is in use. RBridge should update the saved
   triplet of {IP address, MAC address, ingress nickname} based on the
   verification.

   The ingress RBridge may use the IA APPsub-TLV [IA-draft] with the
   Local flag set in ESADI [RFC7357] to distribute any new or updated
   triplet of {IP address, MAC address, ingress nickname} information
   obtained in this step. If a push directory server is used, such
   information can be distributed as per [DirMech].

3.2 Determine How to Reply to ARP/ND

   a) If the message is a generic ARP/ND request and the ingress RBridge
   knows the target's IP address, the ingress RBridge may decide to take
 


Yizhou, et al                                                   [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT         TRILL ARP/ND Optimization              April 2015


   one or a combination of the following actions: 

     a.1. Send an ARP/ND response directly to the querier, with the
     target's MAC address, as believed by the ingress RBridge. 

     a.2. Encapsulate the ARP/ND request to the target's Designated
     RBridge, and have the egress RBridge for the target forward the
     query to the target. This behavior has the advantage that a
     response to the request is authoritative. If the request does not
     reach the target, then the querier does not get a response. 

     a.3. Block ARP/ND requests that occur for some time after a request
     to the same target has been launched, and then respond to the
     querier when the response to the recently-launched query to that
     target is received.

     a.4. Pull the most up-to-date records if a pull directory server is
     available [DirMech] and reply to the querier.

     a.5. Flood the request as per [RFC6325].


   b) If the message is a generic ARP request and the ingress RBridge
   does not know target's IP address, the ingress RBridge may take one
   of the following actions.

     b.1. Flood the message as per [RFC6325].

     b.2. Use directory server to pull the information [DirMech] and
     reply to the querier.

     b.3. Drop the message.

   c) If the message is a gratuitous ARP which can be identified by the
   same sender's and target's "protocol" address fields or an
   Unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements [RFC4861] in ND:

   The RBridge may use an IA APPsub-TLV [IA-draft] with the Local flag
   set to distribute the sender's MAC and IP mapping information. When
   one or more directory servers are deployed and complete Push
   Directory information is used by all the TRILL switches in the Data
   Label, a gratuitous ARP or unsolicited NA SHOULD be discarded rather
   than ingressed. Otherwise, they are either ingressed and flooded as
   per [RFC6325] or discarded depending on local policy.

   d) If the message is a Address Probe ARP Query [RFC5227] which can be
   identified by the sender's protocol (IPv4) address field being zero
   and the target's protocol address field being the IPv4 address to be
 


Yizhou, et al                                                   [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT         TRILL ARP/ND Optimization              April 2015


   tested or a Neighbor Solicitation for DAD (Duplicate Address
   Detection) which has the unspecified source address [RFC4862]: it
   should be handled as the generic ARP message as in a) and b).

   It should be noted in the case of secure neighbor discovery (SEND)
   [RFC3971], cryptography might prevent local reply by the ingress
   RBridge, since the RBridge would not be able to sign the response
   with the target's private key. 

   It is not essential that all RBridges use the same strategy for which
   option to select for a particular ARP/ND query. It is up to the
   implementation.

3.3 Determine How to Handle the ARP/ND Response

   If the ingress RBridge R1 decides to unicast the ARP/ND request to
   the target's egress RBridge R2 as discussed in subsection 3.2 item a)
   or to flood the request as per [RFC6325], then R2 decapsulates the
   query, and initiates an ARP/ND query on the target's link. When/if
   the target responds, R2 encapsulates and unicasts the response to R1,
   which decapsulates the response and sends it to the querier. R2
   should initiates a link state update to inform all the other RBridges
   of the target's location, layer 3 address, and layer 2 address, in
   addition to forwarding the reply to the querier. The update message
   can be carried by an IA APPsub-TLV [IA-draft] with the Local flag set
   in ESADI [RFC7357] or as per [DirMech] if push directory server is in
   use.


4 Handling RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) Messages

   RARP [RFC903] uses the same packet format as ARP but a different
   Ethertype (0x8035) and opcode values. Its use is similar to the
   generic ARP Request/Response as described in 3.2 a) and b).  The
   difference is that it is intended to query for the target "protocol"
   address corresponding to the target "hardware" address provided.  It
   should be handled by doing a local cache or directory server lookup
   on the target "hardware" address provided to find a mapping to the
   desired "protocol" address. Normally, it is used to look up a MAC
   address to find the corresponding IP address.

5 Security Considerations

   ARP and ND messages can be easily forged. Therefore the learning of
   MAC/IP addresses from them should not be considered as reliable.
   RBridge can use the confidence level in IA APPsub-TLV information
   received via ESADI or pull directory retrievals to determine the
   reliability of MAC/IP address mapping. (ESADI information can be
 


Yizhou, et al                                                   [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT         TRILL ARP/ND Optimization              April 2015


   secured as provide in [RFC7357] and pull directory information can be
   secured as provide in [DirMech].) It is up to the implementation to
   decide if an RBridge should distribute the IP and MAC address
   mappings received from local native ARP/ND messages to other RBridges
   in the same Data Label.

   The ingress RBridge should also rate limit the ARP/ND queries for the
   same target to be injected into the TRILL campus to prevent possible
   denial of service attacks.
