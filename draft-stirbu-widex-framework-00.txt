1.  Introduction

   This document describes the components and interactions between them
   of the Widex framework used to support XML-based user interfaces,
   where the user interface and application logic may be on different
   machines, and coupled via an exchange of XML DOM events and update
   operations.  The framework described in this document is intended to
   fulfil the requirements described in Internet-Draft Widex
   Requirements [I-D.ietf-widex-requirements].


2.  Architecture Paradigm

   The Model-View-Controller architectural pattern (MVC) [MVC] divides
   an interactive application into three components.  The model contains
   the core functionality and data.  Views display information to the
   user.  Controllers handle user input.  Views and controllers together
   comprise the user interface.  A change-propagation mechanism ensures
   consistency between the user interface and the model.

   Figure 1 describes an extension to the MVC architecture which enables
   the situations where the user interface and the model may be on
   different machines.

        +-----------------------------+            +---------------+

      Figure 1: Architecture paradigm - A networked MVC architecture

   In the networked MVC architecture, the View is exported on the remote
   device while a Virtual View is maintained on the server.  The change-
   propagation mechanism that ensures consistency between the user
   interface and the model is augmented with methods which keep the View
   synchronised with the Virtual View, synchronisation being done via
   updates.  Additionally, user interactions or gestures are captured by
   the View copy and passed to the Controller as events.

Internet-Draft             The WIDEX Framework              January 2006


   It is quite common that the View is not needed in the Widex Server,
   but there are situations (e.g. desktop applications) in which the
   Widex Server has to maintain a real copy of the View.  Therefore, we
   call the View in the Widex Server to be Virtual.


3.  The Widex Framework Definition

3.1.  Overview

   In the context of Widex working group, the user interface is
   understood as XML [XML1.0] data describing the user interface.
   Typically, the XML data is manipulated as levels 2 and 3 in the W3C
   Document Object Model (DOM), see [DOM2.Core], [DOM3.Core], and
   [DOM2.Events] (W3C has yet to complete work on DOM3 events).  Style
   information associated with the user interface can be manipulated via
   the DOM, see [DOM2.Style].

   The Widex Framework, described in Figure 2, is based on the networked
   MVC paradigm described in Section 2.  The Widex framework is handling
   all network related issues involved in the networked MVC
   architecture, e.g. discovery and matching of Widex Elements, setting
   up sessions between Widex Elements, marshaling XML DOM updates or
   events and exchanging them over the wire.

3.2.  Components

   The Widex Framework has three components:

   o  Service Discovery and Session Setup
   o  Widex Sync
   o  Transport

                +-----------+   +--------------------------+
                |           |   |                          |
                |  Service  |   |       Widex Sync         |
                | Discovery |   |                          |
                |    and    |   +--------------------------+
                |  Session  |
                |   Setup   |   +--------------------------+
                |           |   |        Transport         |
                +-----------+   +--------------------------+

                   Figure 3: Widex Framework Components

3.2.1.  Service Discovery ans Session Setup

   The Service Discovery and Session Setup component is treated by the
   Widex Framework as a black box; any service discovery mechanism being
   able to find matches between a Widex Server and a Widex Renderer and
   any session setup mechanism able to establish a session between a
   matching Widex Server and Widex Renderer can be used as part of the
   framework.

   We define a match or compatibility between a Widex Server and Widex
   Renderer when the Widex Renderer can display the user interface
   exported by the Widex Server.  Typically this means that both devices
   support the same XML DOM and XML DOM Events specifications and the
   Widex Renderer has rendering capabilities for the XML user interface
   language exported by the server.

   Quite often, the Widex Server can make better decisions on what user
   interface to export to a particular Widex Renderer if it has
   additional information about its hardware capabilities, e.g. screen
   size, color depth, input methods.

   Therefore, the Service Discovery mechanism MUST negotiate the
   following capabilities:

   o  supported XML DOM level,
   o  supported XML DOM Events level,

Internet-Draft             The WIDEX Framework              January 2006


   o  supported XML user interface description language,
   o  supported transport mechanism.

   The Service Discovery mechanism SHOULD negotiate the following
   capabilities for the Widex Renderer:

   o  resolutions or display ratio,
   o  color depth,
   o  input methods.

   The Session Setup mechanism MUST be able to initiate the Widex
   Session between the Widex Server and the Widex Renderer using the
   selected transport mechanism.

3.2.2.  Widex Sync

   The Widex Sync component provides the functionality that enables the
   marshaling of XML DOM updates and events.

   NOTE: The Widex Sync messages will be defined in a separate document.

3.2.3.  Transport

   The Transport component is treated by the Widex Framework as a black
   box; any transport mechanism being able to facilitate the exchange of
   Widex Sync messages between a Widex Server and a Widex Renderer can
   be used as part of the framework.

   The Transport mechanisms MUST carry the Widex Sync messages as string
   of bits between the Widex Server and the Widex Renderer.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request to IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   The Widex Framework provides no security facilities (e.g.
   authentication or privacy ) of its own.  It relies on the framework
   components for all of these abilities.


6.  Acknowledgements

   TBD.

Appendix A.  Deployment Scenarios

   This Appendix describes the possible scenarios for deploying the
   Widex Framework.

A.1.  Simple Widex Elements

   In this scenario both devices running the Widex Server and the Widex
   Renderer are using the same platform.

A.2.  Multimodal Widex Server

   In this scenario the application running in the Widex Server is a
   multi-modal application compliant with W3C's Multimodal Architecture
   and Interfaces [MMI.Arch], enabling him to interact with several
   Widex Renderers.

A.3.  Multiple Rendering Engines Widex Renderer

   In this scenario the Widex Renderer has support for multiple
   rendering engines, enabling it to interact with several types of
   Widex Servers.

A.4.  Hybrid

   In this scenario the application running in the Widex Server is a
   multi-modal application and at the same time the Widex Renderer has
   multiple rendering capabilities.  It is the job of the Service
   Discovery and Session Setup component to determine which is the most
   appropriate modality of interaction.
