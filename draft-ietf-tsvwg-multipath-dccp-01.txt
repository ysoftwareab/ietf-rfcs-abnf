    DCCP Extensions for Multipath Operation with Multiple Addresses
                   draft-ietf-tsvwg-multipath-dccp-01

Abstract

   DCCP communication is currently restricted to a single path per
   connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers.  The
   simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a DCCP session could
   improve resource usage within the network and, thus, improve user
   experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to
   network failures.  Use cases for a Multipath DCCP (MP-DCCP) are
   mobile devices (handsets, vehicles) and residential home gateways
   simultaneously connected to distinct paths as, e.g., a cellular link
   and a WiFi link or to a mobile radio station and a fixed access
   network.  Compared to existing multipath protocols such as MPTCP, MP-
   DCCP provides specific support for non-TCP user traffic as UDP or
   plain IP.  More details on potential use cases are provided in
   [website], [slide], and [paper].  All these use cases profit from an
   Open Source Linux reference implementation provided under [website].

   This document presents a set of extensions to traditional DCCP to
   support multipath operation.  Multipath DCCP provides the ability to
   simultaneously use multiple paths between peers.  The protocol offers
   the same type of service to applications as DCCP and it provides the
   components necessary to establish and use multiple DCCP flows across
   potentially disjoint paths.

1.  Introduction

   Multipath DCCP (MP-DCCP) is a set of extensions to regular DCCP
   [RFC4340], i.e., the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol denoting a
   transport protocol that provides bidirectional unicast connections of
   congestion-controlled unreliable datagrams.  A multipath extension to
   DCCP enables the transport of user data across multiple paths
   simultaneously.  This is beneficial to applications that transfer
   fairly large amounts of data, due to the possibility to aggregate
   capacity of the multiple paths.  In addition, it enables to tradeoff
   timeliness and reliability, which is important for low latency
   applications that do not require guaranteed delivery services such as
   Audio/Video streaming.  DCCP multipath operation is suggested in the
   context of ongoing 3GPP work on 5G multi-access solutions
   [I-D.amend-tsvwg-multipath-framework-mpdccp] and for hybrid access
   networks [I-D.lhwxz-hybrid-access-network-architecture][I-D.muley-net
   work-based-bonding-hybrid-access].  It can be applied for load-
   balancing, seamless session handover, and aggregation purposes
   (referred to as ATSSS; Access steering, switching, and splitting in
   3GPP terminology [TS23.501]).

   This document presents the protocol changes required to add multipath
   capability to DCCP; specifically, those for signaling and setting up
   multiple paths ("subflows"), managing these subflows, reordering of
   data, and termination of sessions.  DCCP, as stated in [RFC4340] does
   not provide reliable and ordered delivery.  Consequently, multiple
   application subflows may be multiplexed over a single DCCP connection
   with no inherent performance penalty for flows that do not require
   in-ordered delivery.  DCCP does not provide built-in support for
   those multiple application subflows.

   In the following, use of the term subflow will refer to physical
   separate DCCP subflows transmitted via different paths, but not to
   application subflows.  Application subflows are differing content-
   wise by source and destination port per application as, for example,
   enabled by Service Codes introduced to DCCP in [RFC5595], and those
   subflows can be multiplexed over a single DCCP connection.  For sake
   of consistency we assume that only a single application is served by
   a DCCP connection here as shown in Figure 1 while use of that feature
   should not impact DCCP operation on each single path as noted in
   ([RFC5595], sect. 2.4).

1.1.  Multipath DCCP in the Networking Stack

   MP-DCCP operates at the transport layer and aims to be transparent to
   both higher and lower layers.  It is a set of additional features on
   top of standard DCCP; Figure 1 illustrates this layering.  MP-DCCP is
   designed to be used by applications in the same way as DCCP with no
   changes to the application itself.

1.2.  Terminology

   Throughout this document we make use of terms that are either
   specific for multipath transport or are defined in the context of MP-
   DCCP, similar to [RFC8684], as follows:

   Path: A sequence of links between a sender and a receiver, defined in
   this context by a 4-tuple of source and destination address/ port
   pairs.

   Subflow: A flow of DCCP segments operating over an individual path,
   which forms part of a larger MP-DCCP connection.  A subflow is
   started and terminated similar to a regular (single-path) DCCP
   connection.

   (MP-DCCP) Connection: A set of one or more subflows, over which an
   application can communicate between two hosts.  There is a one-to-one
   mapping between a connection and an application socket.

   Token: A locally unique identifier given to a multipath connection by
   a host.  May also be referred to as a "Connection ID".

   Host: An end host operating an MP-DCCP implementation, and either
   initiating or accepting an MP-DCCP connection.  In addition to these
   terms, within framework of MP-DCCP the interpretation of, and effect
   on, regular single-path DCCP semantics is discussed in Section 3.

1.4.  Differences from Multipath TCP

   Multipath DCCP is similar to Multipath TCP [RFC8684], in that it
   extends the related basic DCCP transport protocol [RFC4340] with
   multipath capabilities in the same way as Multipath TCP extends TCP
   [RFC0793].  However, because of the differences between the
   underlying TCP and DCCP protocols, the transport characteristics of
   MPTCP and MP-DCCP are different.

   Table 1 compares the protocol characteristics of TCP and DCCP, which
   are by nature inherited by their respective multipath extensions.  A
   major difference lies in the delivery of payload, which is for TCP an
   exact copy of the generated byte-stream.  DCCP behaves in a different
   way and does not guarantee to deliver any payload nor the order of
   delivery.  Since this is mainly affecting the receiving endpoint of a
   TCP or DCCP communication, many similarities on the sender side can
   be identified.  Both transport protocols share the 3-way initiation
   of a communication and both employ congestion control to adapt the
   sending rate to the path characteristics.

   Consequently, the multipath features, shown in Table 2, are the same,
   supporting volatile paths having varying capacity and latency,
   session handover and path aggregation capabilities.  All of them
   profit by the existence of congestion control.

              Table 2: MPTCP and MP-DCCP protocol comparison

   Therefore, the sender logic is not much different between MP-DCCP and
   MPTCP, even if the multipath session initiation differs.  MP-DCCP
   inherits a robust session establishment feature, which guarantees
   communication establishment if at least one functional path is
   available.  MPTCP relies on an initial path, which has to work;
   otherwise no communication can be established.

   The receiver side for MP-DCCP has to deal with the unreliable
   transport character of DCCP, and can provide flexible handling for
   data stream packet reordering for those applications where it is
   beneficial.  However, many applications that use unreliable transport
   protocols can inherently deal with out-of-sequence data (e.g.,
   through adaptive audio and video buffers), and so additional
   reordering support may not be necessary.  The optional reordering
   mechanisms in MP-DCCP are most likely to be required when the
   different DCCP subflows are routed across paths with different
   latencies.  In theory, applications using DCCP are aware that packet
   reordering might happen, since DCCP has no mechanisms to prevent it.

   The receiving process for MPTCP is on the other hand a rigid "just
   wait" approach, since TCP guarantees reliable delivery.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Operation Overview

   RFC 4340 states that some applications might want to share congestion
   control state among multiple DCCP flows between same source and
   destination addresses.  This functionality could be provided by the
   Congestion Manager (CM) [RFC3124], a generic multiplexing facility.
   However, the CM would not fully support MP-DCCP without change; it
   does not gracefully handle multiple congestion control mechanisms,
   for example.

   The operation of MP-DCCP for data transfer takes one input data
   stream from an application, and splits it into one or more subflows,
   with sufficient control information to allow received data to be re-
   assembled for in-order delivery to the recipient application.  The
   following subsections define this behavior in detail.

   The Multipath Capability for MP-DCCP can be negotiated with a new
   DCCP feature, as described in Section 3.  Once negotiated, all
   subsequent MP-DCCP operations are signalled with a variable length
   multipath-related option, as described in Section 3.1.

3.  MP-DCCP Protocol

   The DCCP protocol feature list ([RFC4340] section 6.4) will be
   enhanced by a new Multipath related feature with Feature number 10,
   as shown in Table 3.

      MUST understand the feature.  If it is "N", then the feature
      behaves like an extension (see Section 15), and it is safe to
      respond to Change options for the feature with empty Confirm
      options.  Of course, a CCID might require the feature; a DCCP that
      implements CCID 2 MUST support Ack Ratio and Send Ack Vector, for
      example.

   The DCCP protocol options as defined in ([RFC4340] section 5.8) and
   ([RFC5634] section 2.2.1) will be enhanced by a new Multipath related
   variable-length option with option type 46, as shown in Table 4.

   [Tbd/tbv] In addition to the multipath option, MP-DCCP requires
   particular considerations for:

   *  The minimum PMTU of the individual paths must be announced to the
      application.  Changes of individual path PMTUs must be re-
      announced to the application if they result in a value lower than
      the currently announced PMTU.

   *  Overall sequencing for optional reordering procedure

   *  Congestion control covering specific mechanisms as, e.g., for
      detecting and reporting congestion occurrence on per-path level
      and for individual adaptation of path-specific transmission rates
      (up to zero rate)

   *  Robust MP-DCCP session establishment (no dependency on an initial
      path setup)

3.1.  Multipath Capable Feature

   DCCP endpoints are multipath-disabled by default and multipath
   capability can be negotiated with the Multipath Capable Feature.

   Multipath Capable has feature number 10 and is server-priority.  It
   takes one-byte values.  The first four bits are used to specify
   compatible versions of the MP-DCCP implementation.  The following
   four bits are reserved for further use.

   will be retransmitted by the sender until this receives the
   corresponding MP_CONFIRM.  The length and sending path of the
   MP_CONFIRM are dependent on the confirmed options, which will be
   copied verbatim and appended as list of options.

   The MP_JOIN option is used to add a new path to an existing MP-DCCP
   flow.  The Path Token is the SHA-1 HASH of the derived key (d-key),
   which was previously exchanged with the MP_KEY option.  MP_HMAC MUST
   be set when using MP_JOIN to provide authentication (See MP_HMAC for

   The MP_KEY suboption is used to exchange key material between hosts.
   The Length varies between 5 and 8 Bytes.  The Key Type field is used
   to specify the key type.  Key types are shown in Table 7.

                         Table 7: MP_KEY Key Types

   Plain Text
      Key Material is exchanged in plain text between hosts, and the key
      parts (key-a, key-b) are used by each host to generate the derived
      key (d-key) by concatenating the two parts with the local key in
      front (e.g. hostA d-key=(key-a+key-b), hostB d-key=(key-b+key-a)).

   ECDHE-SHA256-C25519
      Key Material is exchanged via ECDHE key exchange with SHA256 and
      Curve 25519 to generate the derived key (d-key).

   ECDHE-SHA512-C25519
      Key Material is exchanged via ECDHE key exchange with SHA512 and
      Curve 25519 to generate the derived key (d-key).

     +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
      Type=46  Length=7 MP_OPT=4

   The MP_SEQ option is used for end-to-end datagram-based sequence
   numbers of an MP-DCCP connection.  The initial data sequence number
   (IDSN) SHOULD be set randomly.  The MP_SEQ number space is different
   from the path individual sequence number space.

3.2.6.  MP_HMAC

     +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
      Type=46  Length=23 MP_OPT=5

   The MP_HMAC option is used to provide authentication for the MP_JOIN
   option.  The HMAC is built using the derived key (d-key) calculated
   previously from the handshake key material exchanged with the MP_KEY
   option.  The Message for the HMAC is the header of the MP_JOIN for
   which authentication shall be performed.  By including a nonce in
   these datagrams, possible replay-attacks are remedied.

3.2.7.  MP_RTT

     +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
      Type=46  Length=12 MP_OPT=6

   The MP_RTT option is used to transmit RTT values in milliseconds and
   MUST belong to the path over which this information is transmitted.
   Additionally, the age of the measurement is specified in
   milliseconds.

   Raw RTT (=0)
      Raw RTT value of the last Datagram Round-Trip.  The Age parameter
      is set to the age of when the Ack for the datagram was received.

   Min RTT (=1)
      Min RTT value.  The period for computing the Minimum can be
      specified by the Age parameter.

   Max RTT (=2)
      Max RTT value.  The period for computing the Maximum can be
      specified by the Age parameter.

   Smooth RTT (=3)
      Averaged RTT value.  The period for computing the smoothed RTT can
      be specified by the Age parameter.

   Age (=4)
      The Age parameter is a 4-byte value which is set to the age or
      timestamp when the Ack for the datagram was received in case of
      RTT type = 0 and may contain the periods for computing of derived
      RTT values depending on other RTT types, i.e., the Minimum (=1)
      and Maximum (=2) as well as the averaged smoothed RTT value (=3).

3.2.8.  MP_ADDADDR

   The MP_ADDADDR option announces additional addresses (and,
   optionally, ports) on which a host can be reached.  This option can
   be used at any time during an existing DCCP connection, when the
   sender wishes to enable multiple paths and/or when additional paths
   become available.  Length is variable depending on IPv4 or IPv6 and
   whether port number is used and is in range between 28 and 42 bytes.

   Every address has an Address ID that can be used for uniquely
   identifying the address within a connection for address removal.  The
   Address ID is also used to identify MP_JOIN options (see
   Section 3.2.2) relating to the same address, even when address
   translators are in use.  The Address ID MUST uniquely identify the
   address for the sender of the option (within the scope of the
   connection); the mechanism for allocating such IDs is implementation
   specific.

   All Address IDs learned via either MP_JOIN or ADD_ADDR SHOULD be
   stored by the receiver in a data structure that gathers all the
   Address-ID-to-address mappings for a connection (identified by a
   token pair).  In this way, there is a stored mapping between the
   Address ID, observed source address, and token pair for future
   processing of control information for a connection.

   Ideally, ADD_ADDR and REMOVE_ADDR options would be sent reliably, and
   in order, to the other end.  This would ensure that this address
   management does not unnecessarily cause an outage in the connection

   when remove/add addresses are processed in reverse order, and also to
   ensure that all possible paths are used.  Note, however, that losing
   reliability and ordering will not break the multipath connections, it
   will just reduce the opportunity to open new paths and to survive
   different patterns of path failures.

   Therefore, implementing reliability signals for these DCCP options is
   not necessary.  In order to minimize the impact of the loss of these
   options, however, it is RECOMMENDED that a sender should send these
   options on all available subflows.  If these options need to be
   received in-order, an implementation SHOULD only send one ADD_ADDR/
   REMOVE_ADDR option per RTT, to minimize the risk of misordering.  A
   host that receives an ADD_ADDR but finds a connection set up to that
   IP address and port number is unsuccessful SHOULD NOT perform further
   connection attempts to this address/port combination for this
   connection.  A sender that wants to trigger a new incoming connection
   attempt on a previously advertised address/port combination can
   therefore refresh ADD_ADDR information by sending the option again.

   [TBD/TBV]

3.2.9.  MP_REMOVEADDR

   If, during the lifetime of an MP-DCCP connection, a previously
   announced address becomes invalid (e.g., if the interface
   disappears), the affected host SHOULD announce this so that the peer
   can remove subflows related to this address.

   This is achieved through the Remove Address (REMOVE_ADDR) option
   which will remove a previously added address (or list of addresses)
   from a connection and terminate any subflows currently using that
   address.

   For security purposes, if a host receives a REMOVE_ADDR option, it
   must ensure the affected path(s) are no longer in use before it
   instigates closure.  Typical DCCP validity tests on the subflow
   (e.g., packet type specific sequence and acknowledgement number
   check) MUST also be undertaken.  An implementation can use
   indications of these test failures as part of intrusion detection or
   error logging.

   The sending and receipt of this message SHOULD trigger the sending of
   DCCP-Close and DCCP-Reset by client and server, respectively on the
   affected subflow(s) (if possible), as a courtesy to cleaning up
   middlebox state, before cleaning up any local state.

   Address removal is undertaken by ID, so as to permit the use of NATs
   and other middleboxes that rewrite source addresses.  If there is no
   address at the requested ID, the receiver will silently ignore the
   request.

                             (followed by n-1 Address IDs, if required)

   Minimum length of this option is 4 bytes (for one address to remove).

3.2.10.  MP_PRIO

   In the event that a single specific path out of the set of available
   paths shall be treated with higher priority compared to the others, a
   host may wish to signal such change in priority of subflows to the
   peer.  Therefore, the MP_PRIO option, shown below, can be used to set
   a priority flag for the subflow on which it is sent.

                           1                   2                   3

   Whether more than two values for priority (e.g., B for backup and P
   for prioritized path) are defined in case of more than two parallel
   paths is for further consideration.  [TBD/TBV]

                    Figure 3: Example MP-DCCP Handshake

   The basic initial handshake for the first flow is as follows:

   *  Host A sends a DCCP-Request with the MP-Capable feature Change
      request and the MP_KEY option with Host-specific Key-A

   *  Host B sends a DCCP-Response with Confirm feature for MP-Capable
      and the MP_Key option with Host-specific Key-B

   *  Host A sends a DCCP-Ack with both Keys echoed to Host B.

   The handshake for subsequent flows based on a successful initial
   handshake is as follows:

   *  Host A sends a DCCP-Request with the MP-Capable feature Change
      request and the MP_JOIN option with Host B's Token TB, generated
      from the derived key by applying a SHA-1 hash and truncating to
      the first 32 bits.  Additionally, an own random nonce RA is
      transmitted with the MP_JOIN.

   *  Host B computes the HMAC of the DCCP-Request and sends a DCCP-
      Response with Confirm feature option for MP-Capable and the
      MP_JOIN option with the Token TB and a random nonce RB together
      with the computed MP_HMAC.

   *  Host A sends a DCCP-Ack with the HMAC computed for the DCCP-
      Response.

   *  Host B sends a DCCP-Ack confirm the HMAC and to conclude the
      handshaking.

3.4.  Fallback

   When a subflow fails to operate within the MP-DCCP requirements, it
   is necessary to fall back to the safe operation.  This may be either
   falling back to regular DCCP, or removing a problematic subflow.  The
   main reason for subflow failing is loss of MP-DCCP options.

   At the start of the MP-DCCP connection, the handshake ensures
   exchange of MP-DCCP options and thus ensures that the path is fully
   MP-DCCP capable.  If during the handshake procedure it appears that
   DCCP-Request or DCCP-response or DCCP-Ack messages don't have the MP-
   DCCP options, the MP-DCCP connection will not be established and the
   handshake should fall back to regular DCCP.

   If a subflow attempts to join an existing MP-DCCP connection, but MP-
   DCCP options are not present in the handshake messages, that subflow
   will be closed.

4.  Security Considerations

   Similar to DCCP, MP-DCCP does not provide cryptographic security
   guarantees inherently.  Thus, if applications need cryptographic
   security (integrity, authentication, confidentiality, access control,
   and anti-replay protection) the use of IPsec or some other kind of
   end-to-end security is recommended; Secure Real-time Transport
   Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] is one candidate protocol for
   authentication.  Together with Encryption of Header Extensions in
   SRTP, as provided by [RFC6904], also integrity would be provided.

   As described in [RFC4340], DCCP provides protection against hijacking
   and limits the potential impact of some denial-of-service attacks,
   but DCCP provides no inherent protection against attackers' snooping
   on data packets.  Regarding the security of MP-DCCP no additional
   risks should be introduced compared to regular DCCP of today.
   Thereof derived are the following key security requirements to be
   fulfilled by MP-DCCP:

   *  Provide a mechanism to confirm that parties involved in a subflow
      handshake are identical to those in the original connection setup.






Amend, et al.             Expires 28 April 2022                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft               Multipath DCCP                 October 2021


   *  Provide verification that the new address to be included in a MP
      connection is valid for a peer to receive traffic at before using
      it.

   *  Provide replay protection, i.e., ensure that a request to add/
      remove a subflow is 'fresh'.

   In order to achieve these goals, MP-DCCP includes a hash-based
   handshake algorithm documented in Sections Section 3.2.4 and
   Section 3.3.  The security of the MP-DCCP connection depends on the
   use of keys that are shared once at the start of the first subflow
   and are never sent again over the network.  To ease demultiplexing
   while not giving away any cryptographic material, future subflows use
   a truncated cryptographic hash of this key as the connection
   identification "token".  The keys are concatenated and used as keys
   for creating Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMACs) used on
   subflow setup, in order to verify that the parties in the handshake
   are the same as in the original connection setup.  It also provides
   verification that the peer can receive traffic at this new address.
   Replay attacks would still be possible when only keys are used;
   therefore, the handshakes use single-use random numbers (nonces) at
   both ends -- this ensures that the HMAC will never be the same on two
   handshakes.  Guidance on generating random numbers suitable for use
   as keys is given in [RFC4086].  During normal operation, regular DCCP
   protection mechanisms (such as header checksum to protect DCCP
   headers against corruption) will provide the same level of protection
   against attacks on individual DCCP subflows as exists for regular
   DCCP today.

5.  Interactions with Middleboxes

   Issues from interaction with on-path middleboxes such as NATs,
   firewalls, proxies, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and others
   have to be considered for all extensions to standard protocols since
   otherwise unexpected reactions of middleboxes may hinder its
   deployment.  DCCP already provides means to mitigate the potential
   impact of middleboxes, also in comparison to TCP (see [RFC4043],
   sect. 16).  In case, however, both hosts are located behind a NAT or
   firewall entity, specific measures have to be applied such as the
   [RFC5596]-specified simultaneous-open technique that update the
   (traditionally asymmetric) connection-establishment procedures for
   DCCP.  Further standardized technologies addressing NAT type
   middleboxes are covered by [RFC5597].

   [RFC6773] specifies UDP Encapsulation for NAT Traversal of DCCP
   sessions, similar to other UDP encapsulations such as for SCTP
   [RFC6951].  The alternative U-DCCP approach proposed in
   [I-D.amend-tsvwg-dccp-udp-header-conversion] would reduce tunneling

   overhead.  The handshaking procedure for DCCP-UDP header conversion
   or use of a DCCP-UDP negotiation procedure to signal support for
   DCCP-UDP header conversion would require encapsulation during the
   handshakes and use of two additional port numbers out of the UDP port
   number space, but would require zero overhead afterwards.

6.  Implementation

   The approach described above has been implemented in open source
   across different testbeds and a new scheduling algorithm has been
   extensively tested.  Also demonstrations of a laboratory setup have
   been executed and have been published at [website].
