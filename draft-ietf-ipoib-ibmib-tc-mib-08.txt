Abstract 
    
   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module that 
   contains Textual Conventions and OBJECT-IDENTITIES for use in  
   definitions of management information for IP Over InfiniBand 
   (IPOVERIB) networks.  The intent is that these TEXTUAL 
   CONVENTIONs (TCs) will be imported and used in IPOVERIB related 
   MIB modules.

1. Introduction 
    
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base for 
   use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  
   In particular, it defines Textual Conventions used in IETF IPOVERIB  
   and IPOVERIB-related MIBs. 
       
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",  
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
       
   For an introduction to the concepts of InfiniBand, see [IBTAARCH]. 
    
2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
 
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 
   [RFC2580].

          "Identifies an InfiniBand (IB) Port.  The InfiniBand 
           Architecture (IBA) defines a maximum of 254 physical ports  
           numbered Port 1 to Port 254.  A port is the location on a  
           Channel Adapter, IB Router, or IB Switch to which a link is 
           connected.  If a device has N ports, the physical ports are  
           always numbered from 1 to N.  The relationship between an  
           InfiniBand port and an ifIndex is one-to-one.  As such, the  
           value of an ifIndex object instance can be directly used to  
           identify corresponding instances of the objects defined  
           herein as IB ports.  Note: this definition does include  
           enhanced switch port 0 but not base switch port 0. In the 
           case of a switch with enhanced switch port 0, the ifIndex is 
           offset by 1 from the ibPort. In all other cases, the ifIndex 
           is identical to the ibPort."

           The Global Identifier field is a 16 octet field (octets 1

           subnet prefix and the port's GUID.  It is unique in the  
           InfiniBand fabric.  NOTE: An IPOIB interface may have more  
           than 1 GID associated with it.  
    
           The Queue Pair Number field is a 3 octet field (octets 17,  
           18, & 19) that identifies the destination queue pair.  Note:  
           The reserved field and the QPN field are collectively  
           referred to as the interface-id.  If an IPOIB interface has  
           only 1 GID associated with it, the interface-id MAY contain  
           all zeroes. 
    
           The reserved field is octet 20.  It is reserved for future  
           use.  These bits SHOULD be set to zero."

4. Security Considerations 
    
   This memo defines textual conventions and object identities for use 
   in IPOVERIB MIB modules. Security issues for these MIB modules are  
   addressed in the memos defining those modules.  Because this memo 
   does not define management objects, the memo has no impact on the 
   security of the Internet. 
    
    
5. IANA Considerations 
    
   IANA is requested to make a MIB OID assignment under the transmission 
   branch, that is, assign the infinibandMIB under { transmission 199 }. 
   This sub-id is requested because 199 is the ifType for  
   infiniband(199) and is available under transmission. 
    
   In the future, IPOIB related standards track MIB modules should be 
   rooted under the infinibandMIB subtree.  The IANA is requested to  
   manage that namespace.  New assignments can only be made via a  
   Standards Action as specified in [RFC2434]. 
    
   This document also requests IANA to assign { infinibandMIB 1 } to the 
   IB-TC-MIB specified in this document.
