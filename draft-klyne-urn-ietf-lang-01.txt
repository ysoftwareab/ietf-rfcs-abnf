Internet-Draft           URNs for language tags                 Nov 2001


1. Introduction

   This specification defines a form of URN to be used for language tags
   defined or registered according to RFC 3066 [4].  The URN namespace
   used is 'IETF', defined by RFC 2648 [3]  and extended by RFC???? [7]
   to include names for IETF protocol parameters.

1.1 Background

   RFC 3066 [4] defines a construction and registry for tags used to
   identify human languages.  These tags can be used to describe the
   language used by human-readable text, or other data intended for
   human prsentation.

   There are situations in which it is desired to express a language tag
   in the form of a URI, but no definitive URI form has been defined.

   For example, W3C has defined RDF [5], a generic XML-based metadata
   format that uses URIs to identify objects and the relationships
   between them.  There has been some requirement to use language tags
   with RDF.  RFC 3066 language tags have the desired semantics, but it
   is not clear how they should be represented in RDF.  The normal form
   of identification used by RDF (and the Web in general) is a URI or
   URI-reference as defined by RFC 2396 [2].

   This specification defines a way to embed RFC 3066 language tags in a
   urn: form of URI, which can be used to identify a language in
   contexts where a URI is prefered to a text string or token.

2. Registration template

   The URN sub-namespace for language tags is defined as follows.

   Registry name:
      language

   Specification:
      RFC 3066 [4].

   Repository:
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-tags
      See also non-registered language tags defined by RFC 3066 [4].

   Index value:
      The language tag name is the registry index value.  RFC 3066
      allows this tag name to contain uppercase letters, lowercase
      letters, digits, and dash ("-").  Language tags are case-
      insensitive.

      Some allowed unregistered language tag values are defined by
      reference to ISO standard 639 [6].

   URN formation:
      The URN for a language tag is formed as:
      "urn:ietf:params:language:<tag-name>", where <tag-name> is the
      language registry index value, expressed using lower case letters.

      RFC 2141 [1] defines the format of URNs.  Allowable characters
      include all of those noted above.

      URNs are defined by RFC 2141 [1] as lexically equivalent if they
      are identical following case normalization of the urn scheme name,
      the namespace name and any %-escaping used.  Language tags are
      defined such that upper- and lower-case ASCII characters are not
      distinguished.  In forming a URN, all ASCII characters in the
      language tag must be expressed in lower case.


3. Examples

   This table lists some language tags, and the corresponding urn: URIs.

   MN (Mongolian)
      urn:ietf:params:language:mn

   en-US (American English)
      urn:ietf:params:language:en-us

   zh-yue (Cantonese)
      urn:ietf:params:language:zh-yue

   sgn-GB (British sign language)
      urn:ietf:params:language:sgn-gb

   i-klingon
      urn:ietf:params:language:i-klingon

   i-default
      urn:ietf:params:language:i-default

   x-private
      urn:ietf:params:language:x-private


4. IANA considerations

   This document calls for the creation of a new IETF sub-namespace per
   RFC???? [7].  Registration details are in the preceding section.

5. Security considerations

   No security considerations are introduced by this specification
   beyond those already inherrent in the use of language tags [4].
