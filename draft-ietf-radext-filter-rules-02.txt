INTERNET-DRAFT   Attr. for Filtering and Redirection     4 March 2007 

    
   1.  Introduction 
       
      Within the confines of RADIUS authentication, authorization, and 
      accounting (AAA) environments, there is a requirement for 
      standardized RADIUS attributes to limit user access using filters 
      and/or redirection.  
       
      This document describes filtering and redirection attributes that 
      may prove useful in IEEE 802.1X [IEEE8021X] environments, which 
      provides "network port authentication" for IEEE 802 [IEEE802] 
      media (including Ethernet [IEEE8023] and 802.11 [IEEE80211], 
      [IEEE80211i] wireless LANS), and a variety of other situations.  
       
      While various filtering attributes already exist for RADIUS, such 
      as the [RFC2865] Filter-ID or [Filter] NAS-Filter-Rule attributes, 
      they have drawbacks or lack functionality.  The Filter-ID 
      attribute requires the NAS to be pre-populated with the desired 
      filters. This may be difficult to deploy in roaming scenarios 
      where the home operator may not know what filters have been pre-
      populated by the local operator.  The NAS-Filer-Rule attribute 
      only offers the same functionality as the Diameter [RFC4005] NAS-
      Filter-Rule AVP, which is limited to layer 3 filtering. 
       
      The filtering attributes specified in this document enable 
      description of layer 2 and layer 3 filters as well as redirection, 
      and therefore extend the filter language described in [RFC3588]. 
      The attributes defined in this document may be used with RADIUS 
      dynamic authorization [RFC3576]. 
       
      User traffic redirection is supported with or without tunneling. 
      Tunneling support is provided using the tunnel attributes defined 
      in [RFC2868].   
       
   1.1. Terminology 
    
      In this document when we refer to blocking of IP traffic we mean 
      filtering of IP traffic. Additionally, this document uses the 
      following terms: 
                
      Authenticator 
         An authenticator is an entity that requires authentication from 
         the supplicant.  The authenticator may be connected to the 
         supplicant at the other end of a point-to-point LAN segment or 
         802.11 wireless link. 
       
      Authentication server 
         An authentication server is an entity that provides an 
         authentication service to an authenticator.  This service

INTERNET-DRAFT   Attr. for Filtering and Redirection     4 March 2007 

         verifies from the credentials provided by the supplicant, the 
         claim of identity made by the supplicant. 
       
      Redirection  
         Refers to an action taken by the NAS to redirect the user's 
         traffic to an alternate location. 
       
      Supplicant 
         A supplicant is an entity that is being authenticated by an 
         authenticator.  The supplicant may be connected to the 
         authenticator at one end of a point-to-point LAN segment or 
         802.11 wireless link. 
    
      Terminal 
         A terminal is an endpoint, such as an 802.1X supplicant, 
         attached to the NAS port.  
    
   1.2. Requirements Language 
    
      In this document, several words are used to signify the 
      requirements of the specification.  The key words "MUST", "MUST 
      NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", 
      "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
      interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 
       
      An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or 
      more of the must or must not requirements for the protocols it 
      implements. An implementation that satisfies all the must, must 
      not, should and should not requirements for its protocols is said 
      to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all the must 
      and must not requirements but not all the should or should not 
      requirements for its protocols is said to be "conditionally 
      compliant". 
    
   1.3. Capability Advertisement 
       
      RADIUS does not currently define a method by which a NAS can 
      advertise its capabilities and in many instances, it would be 
      desirable for the home network to know what capabilities are 
      supported by the NAS to ensure proper operational behavior. The 
      attributes defined in this document are intended to be used to 
      enforce policy by the NAS. If a NAS does not recognize these 
      attributes it will most likely ignore them and the desired policy 
      will not be enforced. A method for the NAS advertising the 
      capability to support these attributes would help the RADIUS 
      server understand if the intended policies can be enforced. As a 
      result, the attributes in this document, in particular NAS-
      Traffic-Rule(TBD), can benefit from capability advertisement, if 
      available.

INTERNET-DRAFT   Attr. for Filtering and Redirection     4 March 2007 

       
   1.4 Attribute Interpretation 
    
      If a NAS conforming to this specification receives an Access-
      Accept packet containing an attribute defined in this document 
      which it cannot apply, it MUST act as though it had received an 
      Access-Reject. 
 
      Similarly, [RFC3576] requires that a NAS receiving a CoA-Request   
      containing an unsupported attribute reply with a CoA-NAK.  It is 
      RECOMMENDED that an Error-Cause attribute with value set to   
      "Unsupported Attribute" (401) be included in the packet.  As 
      noted in [RFC3576], authorization changes are atomic so that this 
      situation does not result in session termination and the pre-
      existing configuration remains unchanged.  As a result, no 
      accounting packets should be generated. 
       
   2.   RADIUS Authentication 
    
      This specification introduces one new RADIUS authentication 
      attribute. 
    
   2.5.  NAS-Traffic-Rule 
    
      Description 
          
         The NAS-Traffic-Rule attribute is derived from the Diameter 
         IPFilterRule syntax and enables provisioning of base 
         encapsulation (Layer 2) rules, Internet Protocol (Layer 3-4) 
         rules, and HTTP (Layer 5+) rules on the NAS by the RADIUS 
         server.  Compared to Diameter's IPFilterRule syntax, NAS-
         Traffic-Rule is a superset in functionality, but is largely 
         based on the same syntax foundations.  
          
         Note: This document defines version 1 (v1) of the syntax for 
         the traffic rule attribute.  The facility exists to extend the 
         syntax by using a new version number as noted in the ABNF 
         description. Future syntax revisions of this attribute may use 
         an incremented version number (e.g. v2).  
          
         For each rule and depending on the rule type, the NAS can be 
         instructed to take a single action as follows:  
               
            Rule Type               Allowable rule action  
            -------------------     ---------------------  
            Base Encapsulation      filter, tunnel  
            Internet Protocol       filter, tunnel  
            HTTP                    filter, redirect  
    
 
 
Congdon, et al.           Proposed Standards                  [Page 5]
 




INTERNET-DRAFT   Attr. for Filtering and Redirection     4 March 2007 

         When specifying a base encapsulation rule, NAS-Traffic-Rule 
         processes packets based on the following information that is 
         associated with it:  
              
            Direction                           (in and/or out)  
            Base encapsulation type                       
            Source and destination MAC address  (possibly masked)  
    
         For a base encapsulation rule, the filter action entails having 
         the NAS permit (i.e. forward) or deny (i.e. block) a user's 
         traffic. The tunnel action entails having the NAS forward user 
         traffic to or from a named tunnel that has been established per 
         [RFC2868].   
                    
         When specifying an Internet Protocol rule, NAS-Traffic-Rule 
         processes packets based on the following information that is 
         associated with it:  
                 
            Direction                           (in and/or out)  
            Source and destination IP address   (possibly masked)  
            Protocol  
            Source and destination port         (lists or ranges)  
            TCP flags  
            IP fragment flag  
            IP options  
            ICMP types  
    
         For an Internet Protocol rule, the filter action entails having 
         the NAS permit (i.e. forward) or deny (i.e. block) a user's 
         traffic.  The tunnel action entails having the NAS forward user 
         traffic to or from a named tunnel that has been established per 
         [RFC2868].  
                    
         When specifying an HTTP rule, NAS-Traffic-Rule processes 
         packets based on the following information that is associated 
         with it:  
                    
            HTTP URL   
            Source and destination IP address   (possibly masked)  
    
         For an HTTP rule, the filter action entails having the NAS 
         permit (i.e. forward) or deny (i.e. block) a user's [RFC2616] 
         request message.  For a deny action, the NAS MAY respond to the 
         request message with a code 403 (Forbidden) response in 
         accordance with [RFC2616]. For a redirect action the NAS SHOULD 
         respond to the user's request with a code 302 (Found) response 
         in accordance with [RFC2616].

INTERNET-DRAFT   Attr. for Filtering and Redirection     4 March 2007 

         For the HTTP redirection action, it is also possible to have 
         redirection automatically removed by including a redir-cnt 
         count parameter along with the rule.  The rule will be removed 
         from the active rule set when the rule matches redir-cnt number 
         of times. Upon removal from the active rule set, traffic is no 
         longer evaluated against this rule.  
          
         It should be noted that an HTTP filter or redirect rule is only 
         useful with plain-text HTTP and not [RFC2818] HTTPS. 
         Redirection or filtering of HTTPS is outside the scope of this 
         document.  
          
         As per the requirements of RFC 2865, Section 2.3, if multiple 
         NAS-Traffic-Rule attributes are contained within an Access-
         Accept or CoA-Request packet, they MUST be maintained in order. 
         The attributes MUST be consecutive attributes in the packet. 
         RADIUS proxies MUST NOT reorder NAS-Traffic-Rule attributes. 
          
         The RADIUS server can return multiple NAS-Traffic-Rule 
         attributes in an Access-Accept or CoA-Request packet. Where 
         more than one NAS-Traffic-Rule attribute is included, it is 
         assumed that the attributes are to be concatenated to form a 
         single filter list. As noted in [RFC2865] Section 2.3, "the 
         forwarding server MUST NOT change the order of any attributes 
         of the same type", so that RADIUS proxies will no reorder NAS-
         Traffic-Rule attributes.  
          
         Rules are evaluated in order, with the first matched rule 
         terminating the evaluation. Each packet is evaluated once.  If 
         no rule matches, then packet is dropped (implicit deny all). 
          
         When an HTTP redirect rule matches, the NAS shall reply to the 
         HTTP request with an HTTP redirect in accordance with [RFC2616] 
         redirecting traffic to specific URL. 
          
         Filter-ID (11), NAS-Filter-Rule [Filter] and NAS-Traffic-Rule 
         attributes define how filters are to be applied in the NAS. 
         These attributes are not intended to be used concurrently and 
         SHOULD NOT appear in the same RADIUS message. Only one type of 
         filtering attribute must be processed. If a Filter-ID (11) is 
         present, then the NAS-Traffic-Rule MUST be ignored, if present. 
          
      The NAS-Traffic-Rule attribute is shown below.  The fields are 
      transmitted from left to right: 
          
       0                   1                   2                   3

      Descriptions of notable fields and keywords follow: 
         
         "v1"        Required in every rule to mark rule as being 
                     of 'v1' version of syntax. Future updates to  
                     the rule syntax will be differentiated through 
                     increments to this field (i.e. 'v2', 'v3', etc.). 
       
         "permit"    Allow packets that match the rule. 
       
         "deny"      Drop packets that match the rule. 
       
         "redirect"  Redirect packets that match the rule.       
       
         "tunnel"    Tunnel packets that match the rule. 
          
         "flush"     A flush rule removes all previously assigned  
                     filter rules. When flush is specified, it can be 
                     followed by other NAS-Traffic-Rule attributes. This 
                     allows for an atomic change of authorization with a 
                     single RADIUS message.    
                      
         "permit inout any from any to any"  
                     Special rule that matches against all traffic. This 
                     allows the implicit deny at the end of a filter 
                     list to be overridden. 
    
         "in"        Is from the terminal.  
          
         "out"       Is to the terminal. 
          
         "inout"     Is from and to the terminal. 
    
         ipv4-address  An IPv4 number in dotted-quad form.  Only this 
                       exact IP number will match the rule. 
         ipv6-address  An IPv6 number in canonical IPv6 form.  Only 
                       this exact IP number will match the rule. 
         ipv4-address/ipv4mask 
                    An IP number with a mask width of the form 
                    192.0.2.0/24.  In this case, all IP numbers from 
                    192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255 will match. 
       
                     The bit width MUST be valid for the IP version and 
                     the IP number MUST NOT have bits set beyond the 
                     mask. For a match to occur, the same IP version 
                     MUST be present in the packet that was used in 
                     describing the IP address.  To test for a 
                     particular IP version, the bits part can be set to 
                     zero.

INTERNET-DRAFT   Attr. for Filtering and Redirection     4 March 2007 

         "any"       Keyword for 0.0.0.0/0 or the IPv6 equivalent.   
    
         "assigned"  Keyword for the address or set of addresses 
                     assigned to the terminal.  For IPv4, a typical 
                     first rule is often "deny in ip !assigned" 
                      
                     The sense of the match can be inverted by preceding 
                     an address with the not modifier (!), causing all 
                     other addresses to be matched instead.  This does 
                     not affect the selection of port numbers. 
    
         layer4-port With the TCP, UDP and SCTP protocols, this field 
                     specifies ports to match. 
    
                     Note: The '-' notation specifies a range of ports                
                     (including boundaries). Fragmented packets that 
                     have a non-zero offset (i.e., not the first 
                     fragment) will never match a rule that has one or 
                     more port specifications.  See the "frag" keyword 
                     for details on matching fragmented packets. 
    
         log-rule    Increments rule hit counter by one every time a 
                     packet matches on rule. Counters start with a zero 
                     value at session start and are reset back to a zero 
                     value every time a successful authorization change 
                     occurs due to a CoA message being received by the 
                     NAS.  
                      
      For base encapsulation rules:        
         "l2:"       Prefix to designate a rule as a base encapsulation 
                     rule. 
 
         "l2:ether2" keyword means any Ethernet-II (DIX Ethernet) will 
                     match. 
 
         ether2:val  Used to specify an Ethernet-II type by hexadecimal 
                     number, whereby "val" is replaced by desired 
                     number. Example: "l2:ether2:0x800" for IP ethertype 
                     (0x0800). 
        
         l2-rmon-str Used to specify base encapsulation per the octet 
                     string format defined in [RFC2895], section 4.2. 
                     Example: "l2:0.0.0.2.0.0.0.240" for Netbios over 
                     LLC. 
        
         macaddr     For base encapsulation filter rules of "l2:ether2"  
                     type, the Ethernet MAC address with octet values  
                     separated by a "-". Example: "00-10-A4-23-19-C0".

INTERNET-DRAFT   Attr. for Filtering and Redirection     4 March 2007 

         macaddr/mask   An Ethernet number as above with a mask width of  
                     the form "00-10-A4-23-00-00/32". In this case, all  
                     MAC addresses from 00-10-A4-23-00-00 to 00-10-A4- 
                     23-FF-FF will match. The MAC address MUST NOT have  
                     bits set beyond the mask.  The keyword "any" is  
                    00-00-00-00-00-00/0.  
       
                     The sense of the match can be inverted by preceding 
                     an address with the not modifier (!), causing all 
                     other addresses to be matched instead.   
 
                     Note: macaddr nor macaddr/mask argument is not used 
                     for "l2:rmon" type rules.  
        
      For IP rules: 
         "ip"        Keyword means any IP protocol will match. 
       
         ip-proto    An IP protocol specified by number.   
       
       
         "frag"      Match if the packet is a fragment and this is not 
                     the first fragment of the datagram.  frag may not 
                     be used in conjunction with either tcpflags or  
                     TCP/UDP port specifications. 
 
         "ipoptions" Match if the IP header contains the comma separated 
                     list of options specified in spec.  The supported 
                     IP options are:   ssrr (strict source route), lsrr 
                     (loose source route), rr (record packet route) and 
                     ts(timestamp).  The absence of a particular option 
                     may be denoted with a '!'. 
                        
         "tcpoptions"   Match if the TCP header contains the comma 
                     separated list of options specified in spec.  The 
                     supported TCP options are:  
 
                     mss (maximum segment size), window (tcp window 
                     advertisement), sack (selective ack), ts (rfc1323 
                     timestamp) and cc (rfc1644 t/tcp connection count).  
                     The absence of a particular option may be denoted 
                     with a '!'. 
                        
         "established"  TCP packets only.  Match packets that have the 
                     RST or ACK bits set. 
                        
         "setup"     TCP packets only.  Match packets that have the SYN

         "tcpflags"  TCP packets only.  Match if the TCP header contains 
                     the comma separated list of flags specified in 
                     spec.  The supported TCP flags are:  
 
                     fin, syn, rst, psh, ack and urg.  The absence of a 
                     particular flag may be denoted with a '!'.  A rule 
                     that contains a tcpflags specification can never 
                     match a fragmented packet that has a non-zero 
                     offset.  See the "frag" option for details on 
                     matching fragmented packets. 
                        
         "icmptypes" ICMP packets only.  Match if the ICMP type is in 
                     the list types.  The list may be specified as any 
                     combination of ranges or individual types separated 
                     by commas.  Both the numeric values and the 
                     symbolic values listed below can be used.  The 
                     supported ICMP types are: 
 
                     echo reply (0), destination unreachable (3), source 
                     quench (4), redirect (5), echo request(8), router 
                     advertisement (9), router solicitation (10), time-
                     to-live exceeded (11), IP header bad (12), 
                     timestamp request (13), timestamp reply (14), 
                     information request (15), information reply (16), 
                     address mask request (17) and address mask reply 
                     (18). 
       
      For HTTP redirection rules: 
         redir-cnt   Specifies the number of HTTP redirect rule matches 
                    that should transpire before removing this rule 
                    from the active rule set.  Upon removal from the 
                    active rule set, traffic is no longer evaluated 
                    against this rule.  
       
         redir-url  An HTTP URL. When the 'redirect' rule matches 
                    (src/dst and/or org_URL ), HTTP requests are 
                    redirected to redir_URL address in accordance with 
                    [RFC2616] redirection traffic to specific URL. 
 
         org-url    An HTTP URL. Specifies the HTTP URL against which 
                    user HTTP requests will be evaluated.  If user HTTP 
                    request matches org_URL, then redirection action is 
                    taken.   
       
      For base encapsulation and IP tunnel rules: 
         tunnel_id  A tunnel id. When the 'tunnel' rule matches, 
                    traffic is redirected over the tunnel with the 
                    specified tunnel_id. Traffic can only be redirected 
                    to or from named tunnels that have been established

                    per [RFC2868] and named using the Tunnel-
                    Assignment-ID attribute described therein.  
       
                    The tunnel id MUST be encapsulated in double quotes 
                    and follow the labeling convention defined by the 
                    TEXTDATA.  
                    Example: A tunnel with the name of tunnel "ppp%1" 
                    would be specified as "%22ppp%251%22" 
       
      A NAS that is unable to interpret or apply a deny rule MUST 
      terminate the session. A NAS MAY apply deny rules of its own 
      before the supplied rules, for example to protect the access 
      device owner's infrastructure. 
 
   3.  RADIUS Accounting 
    
      This specification introduces one new RADIUS accounting attribute. 
    
   3.1.  Acct-NAS-Traffic-Rule 
          
      Description 
    
         Acct-NAS-Traffic-Rule enables a RADIUS client to include NAS-
         Traffic-Rule[TBD] rule match counters as part of the accounting 
         message.  
          
          
          
          
         The Acct-NAS-Traffic-Rule attribute is shown below. The fields 
         are transmitted from left to right: 
          
       0                   1                   2                   3

INTERNET-DRAFT   Attr. for Filtering and Redirection     4 March 2007 

      Counter  
          
         The Counter field is eight octets in length and contains the 
         64-bit hit count for the rule specified in the Text field. 
    
      Text 
    
         The Text field is greater than one octet in length and is used 
         to specify the rule for which a hit count is associated with. 
         The Text field MUST conform to the syntax rules specified for 
         the Text field of the NAS-Traffic-Rule[TBD] attribute. 
          
   4.  Table of Attributes  
 
      The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be 
      found in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity. 
    
      Access- Access- Access- Access-   CoA- 
      Request Accept  Reject  Challenge Req  #   Attribute 
      0       0+      0       0         0+   TBD NAS-Traffic-Rule 
    
      Actng-   Actng- 
      Request  Response    #      Attribute 
      0-1       0          TBD    Acct-NAS-Traffic-Rule 
    
      The following table defines the meaning of the above table 
      entries. 
    
        0     This attribute MUST NOT be present in packet. 
        0+    Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in    
              the packet. 
        0-1   Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be 
              present in the packet. 
       
   5.  Diameter Considerations 
    
      When used in Diameter, the attributes defined in this 
      specification can be used as Diameter attribute-value pair (AVPs) 
      from the Code space 1-255 (RADIUS attribute compatibility space).  
      No additional Diameter Code values are therefore allocated. The 
      data types and flag rules for the attributes are as follows: 
 
                                       +---------------------+ 
                                       | AVP Flag rules      | 
                                       |----+-----+----+-----|----+ 
                                       |    |     |SHLD| MUST|    | 
      Attribute Name        Value Type |MUST| MAY | NOT| NOT |Encr| 
      ---------------------------------|----+-----+----+-----|----| 
      NAS-Traffic-Rule      OctetString| M  | P   |    | V   | Y  |

      Acct-NAS-Traffic-Rule OctetString| M  | P   |    | V   | Y  | 
      ---------------------------------|----+-----+----+-----|----| 
       
      The attributes in this specification have no special translation 
      requirements for Diameter to RADIUS or RADIUS To Diameter 
      gateways; they are copied as is, except for changes relating to 
      headers, alignment, and padding. See also [RFC3588] Section 4.1 
      and [RFC4005] Section 9.  
       
      What this specification says about the applicability of the 
      attributes for RADIUS Access-Request packets applies in Diameter 
      to AA-Request [RFC4005] or Diameter-EAP-Request [RFC4072]. What is 
      said about Access-Challenge applies in Diameter to AA-Answer 
      [RFC4005] or Diameter-EAP-Answer [RFC4072] with Result-Code AVP 
      set to DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH. 
       
      What is said about Access-Accept applies in Diameter to AA-Answer 
      or Diameter-EAP-Answer messages that indicate success. Similarly, 
      what is said about RADIUS Access-Reject packets applies in 
      Diameter to AA-Answer or Diameter-EAP-Answer messages that 
      indicate failure. 
       
      What is said about COA-Request applies in Diameter to Re-Auth-
      Request [RFC4005]. 
       
      What is said about Accounting-Request applies to Diameter 
      Accounting-Request [RFC4005] as well. 
    
   6.  IANA Considerations 
    
      This specification does not create any new registries.  
       
      This document uses the RADIUS [RFC2865] namespace, see 
      <http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types>.  Allocation of two 
      updates for the section "RADIUS Attribute Types" is requested. The 
      RADIUS attributes for which values are requested are: 
      
      TBD - NAS-Traffic-Rule 
      TBD - Acct-NAS-Traffic-Rule 
      
       
   7.  Security Considerations 
    
      Since this document describes the use of RADIUS for purposes of 
      authentication, authorization, and accounting in [IEEE8021X] 
      enabled networks, it is vulnerable to all of the threats that are 
      present in other RADIUS applications. For a discussion of these 
      threats, see [RFC2607], [RFC3162], [RFC3579], and [RFC3580].  
        
 
 
Congdon, et al.           Proposed Standards                 [Page 17]
 




INTERNET-DRAFT   Attr. for Filtering and Redirection     4 March 2007 

      This document specifies new attributes that can be included in 
      existing RADIUS messages. These messages are protected using 
      existing security mechanisms; see [RFC2865] and [RFC3576] for a 
      more detailed description and related security considerations. 
       
      The security mechanisms in [RFC2865] and [RFC3576] are primarily 
      concerned with an outside attacker who modifies messages in 
      transit, inserts new messages, or deletes messages. They do not 
      prevent an authorized RADIUS server or proxy from inserting or 
      deleting attributes with a malicious purpose in messages it sends. 
       
      An attacker who compromises an authorized RADIUS server or proxy 
      can use the attributes defined in this document to influence the 
      behavior of the NAS in ways that previously may not have been 
      possible. For example, inserting suitable redirection rules to the 
      NAS-Traffic-Rule attribute may allow the attacker to eavesdrop or 
      modify packets sent by a legitimate client. 
       
      In general, the NAS cannot know whether the attribute values it 
      receives from an authenticated and authorized server are well-
      intentioned or malicious, and thus it is not possible to 
      completely protect against attacks by compromised nodes. In some 
      cases, the extent of the possible attacks can be limited by 
      performing more fine-grained authorization checks at the NAS.  
      For instance, a NAS could be configured not to accept any 
      redirection rules if it is known they are not used in this 
      environment.

   Appendix A - Traffic Redirection  
    
      There are several ways to redirect the user's traffic.  Which 
      method will be used depends on the capabilities available at the 
      NAS and Service Provider's preference. This Appendix describes 
      various methods to redirect user traffic by using the new 
      attributes outlined in this document in conjunction with existing 
      attributes, which are: 
       
            1) Tunneling; and 
            2) HTTP Redirection; 
       
      For each method we describe how redirection is done at service 
      initiation and mid-session.  We also describe how redirection is 
      removed when it is no longer desired. 
 
   A.1  Tunneling 
       
      User traffic can be redirected by tunneling the user's traffic to 
      an alternate location. Tunneling will typically redirect all of 
      the user's traffic for the Service.  When tunneling is used to 
      redirect all the traffic, then filtering may not be necessary. 
       
   A.1.1  Service Initiation 
       

 
 
Congdon, et al.           Proposed Standards                 [Page 20]
 




INTERNET-DRAFT   Attr. for Filtering and Redirection     4 March 2007 

      Redirect using tunnels at service initiation requires that the 
      RADIUS server send the appropriate [RFC2868] tunnel attributes and 
      NAS-Traffic-Rule attributes to the NAS.  The [RFC2868] tunnel 
      attributes describe the tunnel endpoint and the type of tunnel to 
      construct.  The 'tunnel <tunnel_id>' option for the NAS-Traffic-
      Rule allows the specification of a traffic rule for which to 
      redirect traffic to a named tunnel.  
       
   A.1.2  Mid-session Tunnel Redirection 
       
      Redirection of traffic using tunnels mid-session involves sending 
      the tunnel attributes as per [RFC2868] to the NAS using Change-of-
      Authorization (CoA) message.  The operation is described in 
      [RFC3576].  Careful attention should be paid to the security 
      issues in [RFC3576]. 
       
      Note that if the session is already tunneled (eg. Mobile-IP) then 
      the CoA message with a new tunnel specification can be sent to the 
      NAS or alternatively the redirection can occur at the tunnel 
      endpoint (the Home Agent) using any one of these methods. 
       
   A.1.3  Tunnel Redirection Removal 
       
      If the normal mode for the session was to tunnel the session and 
      redirection was sent to the NAS, the RADIUS Server can send the 
      original tunnel attributes to the NAS in a CoA message.  The NAS 
      will tear down the tunnel and establish a connection back to the 
      original tunnel endpoint. 
       
      However, if the normal mode for the session is not to use 
      tunneling then there is a problem because RADIUS does not have a 
      mechanism whereby it can de-tunnel.  Receiving a CoA message 
      without tunnel attributes would not have an effect on an existing 
      tunnel.  In order to de-tunnel the session, the RADIUS server has 
      to send the NAS a CoA message with Service-Type(6) set to 
      "Authorize-Only" causing the NAS to perform a re-Authorization.  
      In response to the re-Authorization, the RADIUS server will send 
      an Access-Accept packet without the tunneling information.  Upon 
      receiving the corresponding Access-Accept packet the NAS MUST 
      apply the new authorization attributes.  If these do not contain 
      tunnel attributes, then the NAS MUST tear down the tunnel. 
    
   A.1.4 Tunnel Redirection Examples 
    
      The following examples illustrate how traffic flows when subjected 
      to a NAS-Traffic-Rule using tunnel redirection.  In these 
      scenarios, the following notation is used to represent traffic 
      flows:

      ------>  Flow in one direction 
      <----->  Flow in two directions 
      ======>  Flow in a tunnel in one direction  
      <=====>  Flow in a tunnel in two directions 
       
       
      A RADIUS server that wishes all IP traffic to flow between the 
      client and a selected redirection destination will issue an 
      Access-Accept that contains the specification for the tunnel using 
      the attributes defined by RFC 2868 and a NAS-Traffic-Rule 
      attribute using the tunnel action and arguments. 
       
      An example NAS-Traffic-Rule will look like: 
       
      tunnel "t1" in ip from assigned to any 
       
      This will cause all traffic that flows from the client to any 
      destination to be tunneled over the named tunnel "t1" to the 
      tunnel endpoint (TEP). 
       
         +-------+            +------+         +------+       +------+ 
         |       |            |      |         |Tunnel|       |      | 
         |client +<---------->+ NAS  +<==t1===>+ End  +<----->+ Dest | 
         |       |            |      |         |Point |       |      | 
         +-------+            +------+         +------+       +------+ 
       
      The direction argument takes the values of "in", "out" or "inout" 
      and is important because it controls how information is routed. 
      The following diagram demonstrates how traffic is routed. In all 
      these diagrams time is increasing as we proceed down the page. 
       
      When rule direction is "in": 
       
         client       NAS       TEP    DESTINATION 
           |           |         |          | 
           |---------->|===t1===>|--------->| 
           |           |         |          | 
           |<----------|<-------------------|  (flows directly to NAS) 
           |           |         |          | 
            
      The inbound traffic from the client matches the specified filter 
      rule and the IP packet is placed in the tunnel to the TEP. The TEP 
      forwards the packet to the Destination using the destination IP 
      address in the packet header. Note that the source address of the 
      packet is the address assigned at the NAS. Therefore if the 
      destination were to reply to the packet it would use the NAS 
      source address and the packet would flow directly to the NAS and 
      to the client bypassing the TEP.  The Home network would use this

INTERNET-DRAFT   Attr. for Filtering and Redirection     4 March 2007 

      capability if it was only interested in metering or seeing the 
      inbound traffic from the client. 
       
      However, if the home network wanted to see the traffic in both 
      directions it could deploy a NAT function at the TEP. 
       
      Here is the flow when the TEP is acting like a NAT:  
       
         client       NAS       TEP/NAT DESTINATION 
           |           |         |          | 
           |---------->|===t1===>|--------->| 
           |           |         |          | 
           |<----------|<==t1====|<---------| 
       
       
      The client establishes a connection to the Destination, but the 
      TEP acting as NAT, changes the source address of the IP packet (as 
      NATs do) to that of the TEP/NAT.  Now any replies from the 
      Destination are sent to the TEP/NAT.  The TEP/NAT then forwards 
      these packets to the client through the NAS. 
       
      When the TEP is acting as a NAT, using the direction argument "in" 
      is important. The direction argument set to "out" will have no 
      effect on traffic coming from the tunnel since all traffic to the 
      client should come from the TEP/NAT inside the tunnel.  The 
      direction argument set to "inout" will have the same effect as if 
      it were set to "in". 
       
      The TEP/NAT forwards all traffic for the client into the tunnel to 
      the NAS. The NAS always forwards any egressing traffic from the 
      tunnel to the client. It does not apply any redirection rules on 
      traffic egressing a tunnel. The NAS does not care whether the TEP 
      is transparent or is acting as a NAT.  
       
   A.2  HTTP Redirection 
       
      Another method of redirection is at the application layer, 
      specifically the HTTP layer.  An HTTP aware NAS redirects traffic 
      by issuing an HTTP Redirect response causing the user's browser to 
      navigate to an alternate Web Portal. 
       
      The call flow associated with performing redirection at the HTTP 
      layer is very similar with the call flow associated with 
      redirection done at the IP layer.   
       
      The same NAS-Traffic-Rule(TBD) attribute described above is used 
      to convey the redirection rules to use for HTTP redirection.  HTTP 
      redirection rules within the NAS-Traffic-Rule attribute supports 
      the encoding of a redirection URL to apply when a rule is matched.

INTERNET-DRAFT   Attr. for Filtering and Redirection     4 March 2007 

       
   A.2.1  Service Initiation 
       
      As with previous call flows, the RADIUS server MAY send multiple 
      HTTP redirect or filtering rules within a NAS-Traffic-Rule(TBD) 
      attribute to the NAS in the Access-Accept message.   
       
   A.2.2  Mid-session HTTP Redirection 
       
      If HTTP redirection is required to be applied to a service that 
      has already been started then the RADIUS server can push the 
      redirection rules, and optionally the filter rules, to the NAS 
      within a NAS-Traffic-Rule(TBD) attribute using a CoA-Request 
      message. The NAS will then commence to apply the redirection rules 
      and/or the filter rules.  
       
      Alternatively, the RADIUS server can request that the NAS re-
      authorize the session using the procedures defined in [RFC3576]. 
      The RADIUS server responds with an Access-Accept message (with 
      Service-Type(6) set to "Authorize Only" that will contain the 
      redirection and optionally filtering rules within a NAS-Traffic-
      Rule(TBD) attribute. 
       
   A.2.3  HTTP Redirection Removal 
       
      HTTP Redirection rules can be automatically removed mid-session 
      from the NAS using the redir-cnt parameter or explicitly removed 
      from the RADIUS server. The RADIUS server can explicitly turn HTTP 
      redirection off mid-session in two ways. It can push new 
      redirection rules within a NAS-Traffic-Rule(TBD) attribute using a 
      CoA-Request message or it can send the NAS a CoA-Request message 
      requesting it to re-authorize.  
       
      When using CoA-Request message to return the redirection and 
      filtering back to "normal," there needs to be either a filter rule 
      (or filter-id) or redirection rule that corresponds to the 
      "normal" state. If normally the session did not have any filter 
      and or redirection rules applied, the RADIUS server can send a 
      NAS-Traffic-Rule(TBD) with the action of "flush" in the CoA-
      Request message. This action will cause all the filter rules and 
      redirection rules previously assigned to the session to be 
      removed.  
       
   A.3  Accounting 
       
      Every time a session is redirected and every time the redirection 
      is reverted back a new session is created and the old one is 
      terminated. Therefore the NAS MUST generate and Accounting-

INTERNET-DRAFT   Attr. for Filtering and Redirection     4 March 2007 

      Request(Stop) for the old session and an Accounting-Request(Start) 
      for the new session. 
    
   A.4  Example Scenarios 
    
      The following two examples illustrate the user's experience when 
      being redirected.   
    
      For the first example assume an [IEEE8021X] environment, whereby a 
      user connects to the enterprise LAN and initiates an 
      authentication handshake.  As part of the overall authentication 
      process, it is also possible to pass endpoint state such as patch 
      level, virus signature status, etc., all of which can be verified 
      by a back-end server for policy compliancy and alter the 
      authentication and authorization decision. In instances that an 
      end-host is not in compliancy, the NAS may be instructed to limit 
      network access in some fashion (i.e. quarantine) and limit network 
      access to remediation services and a web-based information site.  
      A user may sense degraded network performance and open a web 
      session, which the NAS would redirect to the web-based information 
      site for compliancy status, remediation actions, etc.    
         
      For the second example assume an ISP environment, whereby a 
      prepaid user is roaming the net in their hotel room over WiFi and 
      is to be Hot-lined because their account has no more funds. The 
      user's Service Provider instructs the NAS to block all traffic, 
      and redirect any port 80 traffic to the Service Provider's Prepaid 
      Portal.  Upon detecting that there is no service, the user 
      launches his browser and regardless of which web site is being 
      accessed the browser traffic will arrive at the Prepaid Portal 
      which will then return a page back to the subscriber indicating 
      that he needs to replenish his account. 
       
   Appendix B - NAS-Traffic-Rule Filter Examples 
    
      This appendix presents a variety of filter examples utilizing the 
      syntax definition described in section 3.5 
       
      Example #1: Permit all user traffic, regardless of type.  
       
         v1 permit inout any from any to any 
       
      Example #2: Permit only L2 traffic coming from and going to a 
      user's Ethernet MAC address. Block all other traffic. Assume 
      user's MAC address is 00-10-A4-23-19-C0. 
          
         v1 permit in l2:ether2 from 00-10-A4-23-19-C0 to any 
         v1 permit out l2:ether2 from any to 00-10-A4-23-19-C0

      Assume tunnel name is: tunnel "1234".  
       
         v1 permit tunnel "tunnel \"1234\"" inout l2:ether2 from any to   
            any 
         
      Example #4: Permit only L3 traffic coming and going to from a 
      user's IP address. Block all other traffic. Assume user's IP 
      address is 192.0.2.128.  
       
         v1 permit in ip from 192.0.2.128 to any 
         v1 permit out ip from any to 192.0.2.128 
       
      Example #5: Permit only L3 traffic coming and going to the user's 
      assigned IP address. Block all other traffic.  
          
         v1 permit in ip from assigned to any 
         v1 permit out ip from any to assigned 
       
      Example #6: Allow user to generate ARP requests, DNS requests, and 
      HTTP (port 80) requests. Assume user's MAC address is 00-10-A4-23-
      19-C0 and IP address is 192.0.2.128. 
       
         v1 permit in l2:ether:0x0806 from 00-10-A4-23-19-C0 to any 
         v1 permit out l2:ether:0x806 from any to 00-10-A4-23-19-C0 
         v1 permit in 17 from 192.0.2.168 to any 53 
         v1 permit out 17 from any 53 to 192.0.2.168 
         v1 permit in 6 from 192.0.2.168 80 to any 
         v1 permit out 6 from any 80 to 192.0.2.168 
       
      Example #7: Allow user to generate ARP requests, DNS requests, and 
      HTTP (port 80) requests, any of which are redirected to 
      http://www.goo.org. Assume user's MAC address is 00-10-A4-23-19-C0 
      and IP address is 192.0.2.128. 
       
         v1 permit in l2:ether:0x0806 from 00-10-A4-23-19-C0 to any 
         v1 permit out l2:ether:0x806 from any to 00-10-A4-23-19-C0

         v1 permit out 17 from any 53 to 192.0.2.168 
         v1 redirect http://www.goo.org in from 192.0.2.168 to any 80 
       
      Example #8: Allow user to generate ARP requests, DNS requests, and 
      HTTP (port 80) requests, of which only requests to 
      http://www.goo.org are redirected to http://www.goo.org. Assume 
      user's MAC address is 00-10-A4-23-19-C0 and IP address is 
      192.0.2.128
