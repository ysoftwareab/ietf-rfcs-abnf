1. Overview  
     
   The European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) is defining 
   a Next Generation Network (NGN) where a substantial part of it is 
   based on the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) defined by the Third-
   Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). IMS is largely based on the 
   Session Initiation Protocol [1].  
        
   ETSI has developed a number of requirements draft-jesske-sipping-
   tispan-requirements [5] to support the usage of SIP in Next 
   Generation Networks that interoperate, at the service level, with the 
   Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), the Integrated Services 
   Digital Network (ISDN), the 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), and 
   SIP networks and terminals that implement the service logic.  
        
   In order to provide full support in SIP of existing services, 
   extensions to SIP are needed.    
   This document proposes the use of the Reason header field in 
   responses. This is needed for creating services that must be 
   interoperable with the PSTN/ISDN network and the interoperability of 
   traversing communications through SIP not using SIP-I. This fulfils 
   the requirement [REQ-GEN-1 in draft-jesske-sipping-tispan-
   requirements [5]]  
 
2.Overall Applicability  
     
   The SIP procedures specified in this document are foreseen for 
   networks providing simulation services and/or interworking to the 
   PSTN/ISDN.

                      Reason Header in Responses             June 2007 
 
 
   The document is describing the use of the Reason header in SIP 
   responses. These procedures are only valuable if the reason contained 
   in the element "protocol" is "Q.850". A inclusion of a SIP reason 
   (protocol="SIP") is not helpful due to the fact that the response 
   already provides the SIP reason. The Release Causes are described 
   within ETSI EN300 485 [5]  
    
        
3. Terminology  
     
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. [9]. 
    
4. Procedures  
     
   For providing services and PSTN/ISDN interoperability for SIP 
   networks it MUST be possible to include Reason header fields with 
   Q.850 Cause values in responses.  
     
4.1 Procedures at the UA  
     
   A UA that supports the Reason header field can process the Q.850 
   Cause Value and display it or an equivalent text. The inclusion of a 
   Reason header field by UA is only for 2B2 UA interworking with the 
   PSTN/ISDN or providing PSTN/ISDN like services foreseen.  
   For a pure SIP UA the reason header will not harm if not supported 
   because it will not be processed. For SIP end devices the support of 
   the Reason header field the cause maybe an valuable hint why the call 
   was released by an non SIP entity.  
     
4.2 Procedures at a SIP proxy  
     
   SIP proxies that receive a response containing a Reason header field 
   is forwarding the response without changing the reason.   
        
   A SIP proxy receiving a request that includes a Reason header field 
   can route the request to an application server for further analysis 
   and base services on it.   
        
   Based on network policy a Proxy can remove a Reason header field send 
   from a UAC.  
     
4.3 Procedures at an application server  
     
   An application server that receives a SIP request that contains a 
   response including a Reason header MAY analyze the SIP Reason and 
   base further procedures on this analyses.

   For Example the application server could use the reason for sending a 
   announcement towards the originating entity of the Session.   
        
   If the application server provides a Service it can provide also 
   Responses include a Q.850 reason in responses.   
        
    
5. Procedures at an interworking point with ISUP 
   For interoperability reasons the Q.850 Cause Value of a Release shall 
   be mapped to the Reason Header.

7. Security Considerations  
  
   The presence of the Reason header in a response does not affect the  
   treatment of the response.  
   Including such a header by an untrusted entity could adulterate the  
   reactions of the originating entities. E.G. sending back a cause 
   value  
   "87" can cause an announcement within the PSTN/ISDN saying that the  
   call was rejected due to the Closed User Group service.   
   Therefore it is RECOMMENDED to include the Reason header only by 
   trusted entities as it is described within RFC3325 [8] or at least by 
   network entities. 
  
 
8. IANA Considerations 
 
   This document describes the use of the Reason header field described 
   within RFC 3326 [2]. No additional SIP elements are defined within 
   this document. Therefore, this document does not provide any action 
   to IANA.
