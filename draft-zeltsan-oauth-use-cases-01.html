  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The need for documenting the OAuth use cases was discussed at the oauth WG virtual meetings, on the group's mailing list, and at the IETF 77 and IETF 78. This Internet-Draft describes such use cases.  The objective of the draft is to initiate discussion that will lead to defining a set of the use cases that the OAuth specifications should support.  The following section provides the abbreviated descriptions of the use cases.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> Notational Conventions</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> OAuth use cases</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">This section lists the use cases that have been discussed by the oauth WG.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.1">3.1.</a> Web server</h1>
<p><br> Description: <br><br> Alice accesses an application running on a web server at www.printphotos.example.com and instructs it to print her photographs that are stored on a server www.storephotos.example.com. The application at www.printphotos.example.com receives Alice's authorization for accessing her photographs without learning her authentication credentials with www.storephotos.example.com.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.2">Pre-conditions: </p>

<ul>
<li>Alice has registered with www.storephotos.example.com to enable authentication </li>
<li>The application at www.printphotos.example.com has established authentication credentials with the application at www.storephotos.example.com </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.3">Post-conditions: <br><br> A successful procedure results in the application www.printphotos.example.com receiving an authorization code from www.storephotos.example.com. The code is bound to the application at www.printphotos.example.com and to the callback URL supplied by the application. The application at www.printphotos.example.com uses the authorization code for obtaining an access token from www.storephotos.example.com. The application at www.storephotos.example.com issues an access token after authenticating the application at www.printphotos.example.com and validating the authorization code that it has submitted. The application at www.printphotos.example.com uses the access token for getting access to Alice's photographs at www.storephotos.example.com.  <br><br> Note: When an access token expires, the service at www.printphotos.example.com needs to repeat the OAuth procedure for getting Alice's authorization to access her photographs at www.storephotos.example.com. Alternatively, if Alice wants to grant the application a long lasting access to her resources at www.storephotos.example.com, the authorization server associated with www.storephotos.example.com may issue the long-living tokens.  Those tokens can be exchanged for short-living access tokens required to access www.storephotos.example.com.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.4">Requirements: </p>

<ul>
<li>The server www.printphotos.example.com, which hosts an OAuth client, must be capable of issuing the HTTP redirect requests to Alice's user agent - a browser </li>
<li>Application at www.storephotos.example.com must be able to authenticate Alice. The authentication method is not in the OAuth scope </li>
<li>Application at www.storephotos.example.com must obtain Alice's authorization of the access to her photos by www.printphotos.example.com </li>
<li>Application at www.storephotos.example.com may identify to Alice the scope of access that www.printphotos.example.com has requested while asking for Alice's authorization </li>
<li>Application at www.storephotos.example.com must be able to authenticate the application at www.printphotos.example.com and validate the authorization code before issuing an access token </li>
<li>Application at www.printphotos.example.com must provide a callback URL to the application at www.storephotos.example.com (note: the URL can be pre-registered with www.storephotos.example.com) </li>
<li>Application at www.storephotos.example.com is required to maintain a record that associates the authorization code with the application at www.printphotos.example.com and the callback URL provided by the application </li>
<li>Access tokens are bearer's tokens (they are not associated with a specific application, such as www.printphotos.example.com) and should have a short lifespan </li>
<li>Application at www.storephotos.example.com must invalidate the authorization code after its first use </li>
<li>Alice's manual involvement in the OAuth authorization procedure (e.g., entering an URL or a password) should not be required. (Alice's authentication to www.storephotos.example.com is not in the OAuth scope) </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.2">3.2.</a> User-agent</h1>
<p><br> Description: <br><br> Alice has installed on her computer a gaming application. She keeps her scores in a database of a social site at www.fun.example.com. In order to upload Alice's scores, the application gets access to the database with her authorization.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.2">Pre-conditions: </p>

<ul>
<li>Alice has installed a gaming application implemented in a scripting language (e.g., JavaScript) that runs in her browser and uses OAuth for accessing a social site at www.fun.example.com </li>
<li>There is no a web site supporting this application and capable of handling the OAuth flow </li>
<li>The installed application is registered with the social site at www.fun.example.com and has an identifier </li>
<li>Alice has registered with www.fun.example.com for identification and authentication </li>
<li>An auxiliary web server at www.help.example.com is reachable by Alice's browser and capable of providing a script that extracts an access token from an URL's fragment </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.3">Post-conditions: <br><br> A successful procedure results in Alice's browser receiving an access token. The access token is received from www.fun.example.com as a fragment of a redirection URL of an auxiliary web server www.help.example.com. Alice's browser follows the redirection, but retains the fragment. From the auxiliary web server at www.help.example.com Alice's browser downloads a script that extracts access token from the fragment and makes it available to the gaming application. The application uses the access token to gain access to Alice's data at www.fun.example.com.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.4">Requirements: </p>

<ul>
<li>Registration of the application running in the Alice's browser with the application running on www.fun.example.com is required for identification </li>
<li>Alice's authentication with www.fun.example.com is required </li>
<li>Application running at www.fun.example.com must be able to describe to Alice the request made by the gaming application running on her computer and obtain Alice's authorization for or denial of the requested access </li>
<li>After obtaining Alice's authorization the application running at www.fun.example.com must respond with an access token and redirect Alice's browser to a web server (e.g., www.help.example.com) that is  capable of retrieving an access token from an URL </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.3">3.3.</a> In-App-Payment (based on Native Application)</h1>
<p><br> Description: <br><br> Alice has installed on her computer a gaming application (e.g., running as native code or as a widget). At some point she wants to play the next level of the game and needs to purchase an access to the advanced version of the game from her service provider at www.sp.example.com. With Alice's authorization the application accesses her account at www.sp.example.com and enables her to make the payment.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.2">Pre-conditions: </p>

<ul>
<li>Alice has registered and has an account with her service provider at www.sp.example.com </li>
