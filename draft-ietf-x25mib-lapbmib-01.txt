          1.1.  Revision History

          February 1992

          The February 1992 revision of this document (Editor's Internal
          Reference 1.17) incorporated the following changes:

               The name was changed from HDLC to LAPB. This change was
               made because other flavors of HDLC such as LAPD, SDLC,
               and raw HDLC framing, are different enough that this MIB

               will not adequately manage them.

               The Historical Perspective section at the beginning of
               the document has been replaced with a more concise
               Network Management Framework section.

               The name lapbParmKWindowSize was changed to
               lapbParmTransmitKWindowSize and the object
               lapbParmReceiveKWindowSize was added. This change was
               made because section 5.7.4 of ISO 7776 and Table 3 of ISO
               8885 have provisions for different values for the
               transmit and receive window size.

               The name lapbParmN1FrameSize was changed to
               lapbParmTransmitN1FrameSize and the object
               lapbParmReceiveN1FrameSize was added. This change was
               made because section 5.7.3 of ISO 7776 and Table 3 of ISO
               8886 have provisions for different values for the
               transmit and receive maximum frame size.

               The object lapbParmPortIndex was deleted and the
               description of lapbParmPortId was changed.  The object
               lapbParmPortId now identifies an instance of the index
               object for the MIB of the physical device or interface
               below lapb.

               The units for the timers were changed to Milliseconds to
               be consistent with ISO 8885; see table 3.

               The objects lapbParamT2AckDelayTimer and
               lapbParamT3DisconnectTimer both allow values of 0 to
               indicate the timer is not being used.

               The object lapbParamT4IdleTimer has a value to indicate
               timer not in use.

               The object lapbFlowXidReceived was added to the flow
               table.

               The lapbDefTable was added.

               Ranges and sizes were added for all INTEGERs and OCTET
               STRINGs that didn't have them.

          October 1991

          The October 1991 revision of this document basically changed
          the name from LAPB to HDLC to make the objects more
          appropriate for a broader range of uses.  A number of minor
          changes were made to bring the objects in line with
          established conventions.  These changes are as follows.

               The enumerated values of hdlcParmStationType were
               renumbered from 0 and 1 to 1 and 2.

               The object hdlcFlowBusyDefer was renamed
               hdlcFlowBusyDefers.

               The object hdlcFlowRejSent was rename hdlcFlowRejOutPkts.

               The object hdlcFlowRejReceived was renamed
               hdlcFlowRejInPkts.

          June 1991

          The June revision of this document incorporated much of the
          E-mail discussion of the first draft. In particular it
          replaced the lapbStatTable (and all contents) with the
          lapbFlowTable.

          April 1991

          The April 24 version of this document was the first release.
          At that time this document was basically a bunch of objects
          synthesized from various vendor MIBs and a quick reading of
          ISO 7776 [10].  On first reading it appeared to instrument too
          many LAPB normal functions and too few exceptional conditions.
          The lapbStatTable was too long and needed to be redone.

          2.  Abstract

          This memo defines a portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
          protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it
          defines objects for managing the Link Layer of X.25, LAPB.
          The objects defined here, along with the objects in the "SNMP
          MIB extension for the Packet Layer of X.25"[9] and the
          "Definitions of Managed Objects for RS-232-like Hardware
          Devices"[8], combine to allow management of an X.25 protocol

          3.  The Network Management Framework

          The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of
          three components.  These components give the rules for
          defining objects, definitions of objects, and the protocol for
          manipulating objects.

          The Network management framework structures objects in
          abstract information tree. The branches of the tree name
          objects and the leaves of the tree contain the values
          manipulated to effect management. This tree is called the
          Management Information Base or MIB. The concepts of this tree
          are given in RFC 1155 "The Structure of Management
          Information" or SMI [1]. The SMI defines the trunk of the tree
          and the types of objects used when defining the leaves. RFC
          1212, "Towards Concise MIB Definitions" [4], defines a more
          concise description mechanism that preserves all the
          principals of the SMI.

          The core MIB definitions for the Internet suite of protocols
          can be found in RFC 1156 [2] "Management Information Base for
          Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets". RFC 1213 [5]
          defines MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I with changes to
          incorporate implementation experience and new operational
          requirements.

          RFC 1157 [3] defines the SNMP protocol itself. The protocol
          defines how to manipulate the objects in a remote MIB.

          The tree structure of the MIB allows new objects to be defined
          for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

          4.  Objects

          The definition of an object in the MIB requires an object name
          and type.  Object names and types are defined using the subset
          of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [6] defined in the SMI
          [1]. Objects are named using ASN.1 object identifiers,
          administratively assigned names, to specify object types. The
          object name, together with an optional object instance,
          uniquely identifies a specific an instance of an object. For
          human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the
          OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to objects.

          Internet Draft             LAPB MIB              February 1992


          Objects also have a syntax that defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
          language [6] provides the primitives used for this purpose.
          The SMI [1] purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may
          be used for purposes of simplicity and ease of implementation.
          The encoding of an object type simply describes how to
          represent an object using ASN.1 encoding rules [7], for
          purposes of dealing with the SNMP protocol.

          4.1.  Format of Definitions

          Section 6 contains the specification of all object types
          defined in this MIB module. The object definitions use the
          conventions given in the SMI [1] as amended by the concise MIB
          definitions [4].

          5.  Overview

          5.1.  Informal overview

          This section describes how the objects defined below relate
          with other MIBs.  This section is only informational to help
          understand how the pieces fit together.

          The objects defined below are to be used in conjunction with
          MIB-II and other MIBs such as the X.25 packet level MIB [9].
          A system with a complete X.25 stack running over a synchronous
          line will have at least two interfaces in the ifTable defined
          in MIB-II.  There will be an interface for LAPB and another
          interface for the packet layer of X.25. There will also be
          objects defined in the RS-232-like MIB for the physical sync
          line.

          Each software interface identifies the layer below it used to
          send and receive packets. The X.25 MIB object,
          x25InfoDataLinkId, specifies an instance of lapbParamIndex for
          the LAPB interface under that X.25. The LAPB object, defined
          below, lapbParamPortId, identifies an instance of the
          4s232PortIndex for the the Sync line used by LAPB.

          For X.25 running over LAPB over Ethernet, the lapbParamPortId
          would identify the instance of ifIndex for the Ethernet
          interface.

          Each X.25 subnetwork will have separate entries in the
          ifTable.  Thus a system with two X.25 lines would have two
          ifTable entries for the two X.25 packet layers and two other
          entries for the two LAPB interfaces. Each X.25 Packet Layer
          MIB would identify the instance of the LAPB MIB below it. Each
          LAPB MIB would identify the Sync line below it. The system
          would also have two entries for rs232PortTable and
          rs232SyncPortTable for the two physical lines.

          Since the ifTable as defined in MIB-II is device independent,
          it doesn't have anything specific for any type of interface.
          The objects below define the LAPB specific information for an
          interface of type LAPB. Different LAPB interfaces can also be
          differentiated by matching the values of ifIndex with
          lapbParamIndex.

          5.2.  Formal overview

          Instances of the objects defined below represent attributes of
          a LAPB interface.  LAPB interfaces are identified by an ifType
          object in the Internet-standard MIB [5] of

                    lapb(16).

          For these interfaces, the value of the ifSpecific variable in
          the MIB-II [5] has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:

                    lapb    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { To Be Assigned }

          The relationship between a LAPB interface and an interface in
          the context of the Internet-standard MIB [5] is one-to-one.
          As such, the value of an ifIndex object instance can be
          directly used to identify corresponding instances of the
          objects defined below.

          The objects defined below are defined in the context of ISO
          7776 [10] and ISO 8885 [11].  Access to those documents maybe
          useful (but isn't essential) to understand the names and
          semantics of some objects.  To the extent that some attributes
          defined in the Internet standard MIB [5] are applicable to
          LAPB, those objects have not been duplicated here.  In some
          instances some clarification of how to apply those objects to
          LAPB has been given.
