1.  Introduction

   DHCP [RFC2131] is a commonly used mechanism for providing bootstrap
   configuration information allowing a host to operate in a specific
   network environment.  Unlike largely static, logical network
   configuration data, such as a Domain Name Server or default gateway
   address, required by a host to operate in the network, the physical
   location of a host can change; in many cases without the need for a
   network reattachment.  The network node responsible for providing
   physical location information pertaining to a host is the Location
   Information Server (LIS).

   A LIS provides location information to a device using the HELD
   protocol [I-D.winterbottom-http-location-delivery].  HELD is a
   webservices application layer protocol that is accessed by a URI.
   Like most network servers and services the LIS must first be
   discovered by the host prior to use.  This document describes IPv4
   and IPv6 DHCP options for LIS discovery.

2.  Terminology

   The key conventions and terminology used in this document are defined
   as follows:

   This document reuses the terms Target, Location Server, Location
   Generator, Location Recipient and Using-Protocol as defined in
   [RFC3693].  Note that in this context, the Location Server is
   distinct from what is alternatively referred to as a Registrar in
   other contexts.  In some specifications the Location Server is
   referred to as a Location Information Server or LIS.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4.  Location Information Server Discovery

4.1.  DHCPv4

   The DHCPv4 option includes a list of URIs; the first URI must be
   attempted first and subsequent URIs contacted only in the event of a
   problem in retrieving location information.  Each URI must reference
   a service that is able to provide the Target with location
   information.


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  LOCSERV_URI  |    Length     |         URI ...               .
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                    URI (cont. max of 253 octets)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   LOCSERV_URI:  The IANA assigned option number (TBD).

   Length:  The length of the URI in octets.

   URI:  The URI of the HELD service.  This URI MUST be no more than 253
      bytes in length, and MUST NOT be NULL terminated.

4.2.  DHCPv6

   DHCP for IPv6 is defined in [RFC3315].  The DHCPv6 option for this
   parameter is similarly formatted to the DHCPv4 option.


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     OPTION_LOCSERV_URI        |         option-len            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                              URI                              .
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |               URI (cont'd, up to 253 octets)...               .
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   OPTION_LOCSERV_URI:  The IANA assigned option number (TBD).

   option-len:  The length of the URI in octets.

5.  Security Considerations

   The options presented in this document describe how a host can learn
   the URI of the HELD-based LIS in their access network.  The LIS is
   responsible for providing location information and this information
   is critical to a number of network services; a host does not
   necessarily have a prior relationship with a LIS.  Therefore,
   impersonation of a LIS is the most relevant threat to the use of this
   option.  It is recommended that DHCP authentication defined in
   [RFC3118] be used to provide DHCP option integrity.

   The address of a LIS is usually well-known within an access network;
   therefore, interception of DHCP messages does not introduce any
   specific concerns.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has allocated a DHCPv4 option code of [TBD] and a DHCPv6 option
   code of [TBD] for the HELD Service URI option described in this
   document.
