Internet-Draft           The 'qname:' URI Scheme            January 2002


1. Overview

   The 'qname:' URI scheme is intended to provide a simple but
   consistent means by which XML Namespace qualified names [2] may be
   represented for the sake of communication between web applications.

   The 'qname:' URI scheme provides for the distinction between
   elements, global attributes, and per-element attributes to be made
   fully explicit; thus preserving contextual information about the
   occurrence of the name within a given XML instance which may be
   significant to its interpretation.

   The 'qname:' URI scheme belongs to the class of URIs known as Uniform
   Resource Values (URV) which are themselves a subclass of Uniform
   Resource Primitives (URP), a class of URI which constitutes a
   "WYSIWYG" URI, one which is not dereferencible to and does not denote
   another web resource, but constitutes a self-contained resource where
   the full realization of that resource is expressed in the URI itself.
   For a full discussion of the properties of URPs and URVs, please see
   [1].  Familiarity with the concepts defined therein will facilitate
   the full understanding of this document.

   Because a URP is not dereferencible, and hence does not permit the
   suffixation of a fragment identifier (there is no such thing as a URP
   Reference), it is not necessary to escape any hash marks '#'
   occurring in the namespace URI Reference part of a 'qname:' URI.

   Examples:

      qname:title:voc://nokia.com/MARS-2.2/
      qname:title:http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml#
      qname:title:http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/
      qname:label:http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#
      qname:date:http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#
      qname:widget:mailto:jane.doe@booga.com
      qname:e28b11f:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6
      qname:author@name:urn:com:books-r-us
      qname:A@HREF:http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40
      qname:@CLASS:http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40

   These examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not
   necessarily constitute actual URIs.  See the BNF definition below for
   an explicit definition of 'qname:' URI syntax.

   Note that, although it is common practice to represent an XML
   Namespace qualified name in a form where the namespace preceeds the
   name, such as "{namespace}name"; in this URI scheme, the name
   preceeds the namespace in order to achieve a representation which

   facilitates easier parsing by applications, as the URI can be
   partitioned into its name and namespace components simply by scanning
   for the colon ':' after the name portion without any further need to
   parse the namespace URI itself.  It also positions the most mnemmonic
   part of the qualified name first, which can enhance readability.

2. BNF for the 'qname:' URI Scheme

   This is a BNF-like description of the 'qname:' Uniform Resource
   Identifier syntax, using the conventions of RFC 822[3], except that
   "|" is used to designate alternatives, and brackets [] are used
   around optional or repeated elements.  Briefly, literals are quoted
   with "", optional elements are enclosed in [brackets], and elements
   may be preceded with <n>* to designate n or more repetitions of the
   following element; n defaults to 0.

   This BNF description adopts sub-definitions defined in RFC 2396
   "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax" [4] and the W3C
   Recommendation REC-xml-names "Namespaces in XML" [2] which are not
   repeated here.


   qname-URI      = "qname:" name ":" namespace
   name           = element | globalAttr | perElementAttr
   namespace      = absoluteURI [ "#" fragment ]
   element        = NCName
   attribute      = NCName
   globalAttr     = "@" attribute
   perElementAttr = element "@" attribute

   NCName         = <as defined by W3C REC-xml-names>
   absoluteURI    = <as defined by RFC 2396>
   fragment       = <as defined by RFC 2396>


   Note that the URI scheme prefix "qname:" is considered to be a valid
   URI denoting this URI scheme, though it is not itself a valid URI
   according to this URI scheme.

3. Security Considerations

   This document raises no known security issues.
