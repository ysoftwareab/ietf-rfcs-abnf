Abstract

   This document describes filters which limit asynchronous location
   notifications to compelling events.  The resulting location
   information is conveyed in existing location formats wrapped in
   GEOPRIV privacy extensions to the Presence Information Document
   Format (PIDF-LO).  Location disclosure is limited to voluntary
   disclosure by a notifier that possesses credentials for the named
   resource.

1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].

2.  Overview

   Conveying static location in PIDF-LO [1] bodies is straightforward.
   However the difficult part about asynchronous notification of
   location information is that many forms of location are measured as a
   continous gradient.  Unlike notications using discreet quanties, it
   is difficult to know when a change in location is large enough to
   warrant notifications.  Moreover, different applications require a
   wide variety of location resolutions.  Any optimization made for one
   application would ultimately result in wasteful polling or a sluggish
   user interface for other applications.

   The mechanism described here defines filters in XML [3] documents
   which limit location notification to events which are of relevance to
   the subscriber.  These filters persist until they are changed with a
   replacement filter.

   In addition to the relevant filters, this document also defines a new
   XML schema [4] which can be included in PIDF-LO documents to indicate
   that the resource is inside or outside of a container region.

3.  Definition of Location Filter Format

   The granularity of notifications necessary for various geographic
   location applications varies dramatically.  The subscriber should be
   able to get asynchronous notifications with appropriate granularity
   and accuracy, without having to poll or flood the network with
   notifications which are not important to the application.
   Notifications should only happen when the notification would be
   considered an Interesting Event to the subscriber.  Subscriptions to
   this event package contain a filter document in the XML document
   format defined in this section.  The terminal elements in this format
   are defined in terms of existing Geographic Markup Language (GML) [8]
   data types.
      The notifications are in PIDF-LO (by default) or any other format
      acceptable to both the subscriber and notifier.  The selection of
      a subset of GML or specific location format capabilities contained
      in a PIDF-LO body is a generic issue for the GEOPRIV Working Group
      to define, and is out of the scope of this document.

   This document defines the following as an initial list of Interesting
   Events:

   1.  the resource moves more than a specific distance horizontally or
       vertically since the last notification
   2.  the resource exceeds a specific speed
   3.  the resource enters or exits one or more GML objects (for
       example, a set of 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional regions)
       included or referenced in the filter.
   4.  one or more of the values of the specified address labels has
       changed for the resource (for example, the A1 value of the
       civilAddress has changed from California to Nevada)
   This specification makes use of XML namespaces [5] for identifying
   location filter documents and document fragments.  The namespace URI
   for elements defined by this specification is a URN [9], using the
   namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [10] and extended by [11].
   This URN is:

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:location-filter

   The filter format starts with a top-level XML element called
   "<location-filter>", which contains one or more filter events.  The
   semantics of multiple elements inside a location-filter is a logical
   OR.  In other words, if any of the individual filter events occurs,
   the event satisfies the location-filter and triggers a notification.

   The movedHoriz and movedVert filter events each indicate a minimum
   horizontal motion or vertical distance (respectively) that the
   resource must have moved from the location of the resource when the
   last notification was sent in order to trigger this event.  The
   distance is measured absolutely from the point of last notification
   rather than in terms of cumulative motion (For example, someone
   pacing inside a room will not trigger an event if the trigger
   threshold is slightly larger than the room.)  Each of these events
   can only appear once in a location-filter.  These events have an
   attribute "uom" (for "units of measure"), which indicates the units
   of the element.  The default unit for these events is meters.

   Similarly, the speedExceeds filter event indicates a minimum
   horizontal speed of the resource before the speedExceeds event is
   triggered.  This element can appear only once in a location-filter,
   and has a "uom" attribute which defaults to meters per second if not
   present.
      This filter measures the horizontal component of speed in any
      direction.  It does not measure velocity.  Note also that there is
      no corresponding event triggered when speed drops below a
      threshold.

   Below are some examples.  In the first example if the resource moves
   20m in the x,y direction or 3m in the z direction, send a
   notification:

Internet-Draft           Location Event Filters                 Oct 2005


   <location-filter>
     <movedHoriz uom="#meters">20</movedHoriz>
     <movedVert uom="#meters">3</movedVert>
   </location-filter>

   If the resource exceeds 3 meters per second (10.8 km/h), send a
   notification:

   <location-filter>
     <speedExceeds uom="#mps">3</speedExceeds>
   </location-filter>

   The valueChanges filter event contains a string which is interpreted
   as an XPath [6] expression evaluated within the context of the
   location-info element of the PIDF-LO document which would be
   generated by the notification.  The XPath expression MUST evaluate to
   only a single Xpath node.  If the value of any of the elements in the
   resulting node changes, then the filter event is triggered.  Note
   that the value of the resulting node changes if any of those nodes or
   subnodes transitions from having a value to having no value or vice
   versa.  A location-filter may contain multiple valueChanges filters.

   For example, given the following logical PIDF-LO document, If the
   state (A1), county (A2), city (A3), or postal code (PC) changes, send
   a notification:

   Finally, the "enterOrExit" filter event is triggered when the
   resource enters or exits a named 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional
   region or list of regions corresponding to a GML feature.  These
   regions can be defined using inline snippets of GML, or externally
   referenced using a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).  Notifiers
   which support this document MUST be able to support 2-dimensional
   regions and lists of regions, for which the regions can be defined in

   terms of the GML extentOf a Polygon defined using an exterior
   LinearRing object.  These Polygons are defined using the hierarcy in
   the figure below.

   Objects                     Objects

                                        ...
                                        Polygon

   Similarly, Notifiers MUST be able to support 3-dimensional regions
   which can be defined as a fixed height vertical projection of such a
   2-dimensional Polygon, and lists thereof.  Specifically, these are
   GML Solids defined in terms of an exterior Surface of polygonal
   patches, such that all included Polygons are either parallel
   (horizontal) or perpedicular (vertical) to the geoid.

   The posList for any 2-dimensional region MUST be defined using the
   EPSG 4326 coordinate reference system.  The posList for any
   3-dimensional region MUST be defined using the EPSG 4979 coordinate
   reference system.  A location-filter can contain more than one
   enterOrExit filter event.
      Notifiers MAY support other more complex geometries or additional
      coordinate reference systems.  How the Subscriber negotiates
      support for more complex geometries or reference systems is out of
      the scope of this document.
      Likewise, this document does not describe how a subscriber
      discovers the existence of externally referenced features.  This
      topic is out of scope of this document.

   In most cases Subscribers that use location filters based on
   enterOrExit events are especially interested in the resource's
   relationship to those named features.  Consequently, the notifier
   MUST include either a "containment" element for each feature
   mentioned in the location-filter which has changed its containment
   properties with respect to the resource since the last notification.
   These elements are defined in Section 4.  The notifier MAY include
   any other form of location that is relevant.

   For example, if the resource enters or exits Building 10 (which is
   defined by specific 2-D or 3-D rectangular coordinates), send a
   notification:

3.1  XML Schema for filter format

   The XML Schema for this format is defined below.

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

4.  Containment schema

   This section describes the schema for describing the resource's
   location relative to a region or list of regions which might contain
   the resource.  (These regions can be defined dynamically in an
   "enterOrExit" element in a subscription filter, or defined on the
   notifier using some out-of-band mechanism.)  The "pidfResource"
   element is placed inside the location-info element in a PIDF-LO
   document.  The pidfResource element can contain zero or more

   "containment" elements.  Each containment element has a GML Feature
   sub-element (of type "FeaturePropertyType") and a mandatory attribute
   which specifies if the PIDF resource is inside or outside of the
   feature, or if the position of the resource with respect to the
   region or region list is undefined.  If the subscriber is not
   authorized to know the relative position, the notifier MUST NOT
   reveal this private information.  The RECOMMENDED way to prevent the
   subscriber from seeing private location data of this type is to
   return a containment element whose position attribute is "undefined".

   Below is an example PIDF-LO document which indicates that the
   resource is inside building 10, not outside the parking garage, and
   not permitted to know if the resource is in a conference room.  Note
   that in GML, these features could be referenced by their unique

5.  Security Considerations

   Location information is typically very privacy sensitive.  As such,
   GEOPRIV requires that notifications MUST be encrypted and integrity
   protected.

   Additional privacy and security considerations are discussed in
   detail in [7].
