          High Assurance Re-Direction (HARD) Problem Statement
                      draft-barnes-hard-problem-00

Abstract

   This document describes several security challenges involved with the
   increasingly common practice of third-party hosting of applications,
   in particular the inability to know with a high level of assurance
   that the hosting provider is authorized to offer an application on
   behalf of an organization or individual.

Internet-Draft                HARD Problem                     July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Internet applications such as websites, email services, and instant
   messaging (IM) services are increasingly offered by third-party
   hosting providers (e.g., "apps.example.net").  However, an
   organization that contracts with such a hosting provider typically
   wants its applications to be associated with its DNS domain name
   (e.g., "example.com") instead of the hosting provider's name.  This
   introduces a problem that we call "High Assurance Re-Direction"
   (HARD): how can a user or peer of the application securely know that
   the hosting provider is authorized to offer that application on
   behalf of the organization?

   This is indeed a HARD problem, to which no good solutions currently
   exist.  To help technologists find such solutions, this document
   describes the problem and suggests some possible paths to solutions.


2.  Security Challenges of Hosted Applications

   Let us assume that a company called Example.com wishes to offload
   responsibility for its corporate instant messaging service
   ("im.example.com") to a hosting provider called Apps.Example.Net
   using the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol [XMPP].  The
   company sets up DNS service location records [DNS-SRV] that point
   im.example.com at apps.example.net:

   _xmpp-client._tcp.im.example.com. 90 IN SRV 0 0 5222 apps.example.net
   _xmpp-server._tcp.im.example.com. 90 IN SRV 0 0 5269 apps.example.net

   When a user juliet@example.com attempts to log in to the IM service
   at im.example.com, her client discovers apps.example.net and resolves
   that name to an IP address and port.  However, Juliet wants to be
   sure that the connection is encrypted using Transport Layer Security
   [TLS] so her client checks the certificate offered by the XMPP
   service at the resolved IP address and port.

   Her client expects the server identity in the certificate to be
   "im.example.com" (or perhaps "*.example.com").  But what if the
   identity is, instead, "apps.example.net" or "*.example.net"?  Now her
   client will need to prompt Juliet to accept this certificate mismatch
   either temporarily or permanently.  Because such security warnings
   are unnerving to end users, the owners of the company would prefer
   that the IM service offer a certificate with an identity of
   "im.example.com".  Unfortunately, the IM server software used by the
   hosting provider probably needs runtime access to the private key
   associated with the certificate.  This makes both the security
   personnel at Example.com and the lawyers at Apps.Hosting.Net

   uncomfortable.  There are several possible solutions (see for
   instance [XMPP-DNA]:

   o  Terminate the hosting agreement.  However, this is unpalatable to
      the company (IM is not their core competence) and the hosting
      provider (less revenue).
   o  Deploy DNS security extensions [DNSSEC] so that users can be sure
      that the redirect has not been tampered with.  However, DNSSEC is
      not yet widely deployed, so the Example.com admins discover that
      this option is not available.
   o  Deploy the IM service using attribute certificates (ACs) instead
      of public key certificates (PKCs).  However, the hosting
      provider's software does not support ACs and there are no tools
      available that would enable Example.com to generate such ACs.

   The same problem exists in a number of other technologies, including
   the Hypertext Transport Protocol [HTTP], the Internet Message Access
   Protocol [IMAP], the Location-to-Service Translation Protocol [LOST],
   and the discovery of Location Information Servers [LIS].
