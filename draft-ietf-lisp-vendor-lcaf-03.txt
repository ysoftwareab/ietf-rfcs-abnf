          Vendor Specific LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF)
                     draft-ietf-lisp-vendor-lcaf-03

Abstract

   This document describes a new LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF),
   the Vendor Specific LCAF.  This LCAF enables organizations to have
   internal encodings for LCAF addresses.

1.  Introduction

   The LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF) [RFC8060] defines the format
   and encoding for different address types that can be used on LISP
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis] [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis] deployments.
   However, certain deployments require specific format encodings that
   may not be applicable outside of the use-case for which they are
   defined.  The Vendor Specific LCAF allows organizations to create
   LCAF addresses to be used only internally on particular LISP
   deployments.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Vendor Specific LCAF

   The Vendor Specific LCAF relies on using the IEEE Organizationally
   Unique Identifier (OUI) [IEEE.802_2001] to prevent collisions across
   vendors or organizations using the LCAF.  The format of the Vendor
   Specific LCAF is provided below.

                           Vendor Specific LCAF

   The fields in the first 8 octets of the above Vendor Specific LCAF
   are actually the fields defined in the general LCAF format specified
   in [RFC8060].  The "Type" field MUST be set to the value 255 to
   indicate that this is a Vendor Specific LCAF.  The fields defined by
   the Vendor Specific LCAF are:

      Rsvd3: This 8-bit field is reserved for future use.  It MUST be
      set to 0 on transmit and MUST be ignored on receipt.

      Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI): This is a 24-bit field
      that carries the IEEE OUI [IEEE.802_2001] of the organization.

      Internal format: This is a variable length field that is left
      undefined on purpose.  Each vendor or organization can define its
      own internal format(s) to use with the Vendor Specific LCAF.

   The Vendor Specific LCAF type SHOULD NOT be used in deployments where
   different organizations interoperate.  However, there may be cases
   where two (or more) organizations share a common deployment on which
   they explicitly and mutually agree to use a particular Vendor
   Specific LCAF.  In that case, the organizations involved need to
   carefully assess the interoperability concerns for that particular
   deployment.

   If a LISP device receives a LISP message containing a Vendor Specific
   LCAF with an OUI that it does not understand, it MUST drop the
   message.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document enables organizations to define new LCAFs for their
   internal use.  It is the responsibility of these organizations to
   properly assess the security implications of the formats they define.

   The authors would like to thank Joel Halpern and Luigi Iannone for
   their suggestions and guidance regarding this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Following the guidelines of [RFC8126], this document requests IANA to
   update the "LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF) Types" Registry
   defined in [RFC8060] to allocate the following assignment:

              +---------+---------------------+------------+
              | Value # | LISP LCAF Type Name | Reference  |
              +---------+---------------------+------------+
              |   255   |   Vendor Specific   | Section 3  |
              +---------+---------------------+------------+
