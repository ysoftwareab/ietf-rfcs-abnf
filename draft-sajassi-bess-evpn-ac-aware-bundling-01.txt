              AC-Aware Bundling Service Interface in EVPN
              draft-sajassi-bess-evpn-ac-aware-bundling-01

Abstract

   EVPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution
   over an MPLS/IP network for intra-subnet connectivity among Tenant
   Systems and End Devices that can be physical or virtual.

   EVPN multihoming with IRB is one of the common deployment scenarios.
   There are deployments which requires capability to have multiple
   subnets designated with multiple VLAN IDs in single bridge domain.

   [RFC7432] defines three different type of service interface which
   serve different requirements but none of them address the requirement
   to be able to support multiple subnets within single bridge domain.
   In this draft we define new service interface type to support
   multiple subnets in single bridge domain.  Service interface proposed
   in this draft will be applicable to multihoming case only.

Internet-Draft AC-Aware Bundling Service Interface in EVPN February 2020


1.  Introduction

   EVPN based All-Active multi-homing is becoming the basic building
   block for providing redundancy in next generation data center
   deployments as well as service provider access/aggregation network.
   For EVPN IRB mode, there are deployments which expect to be able to
   support multiple subnets within single Bridge Domain.  Each subnet
   would be differentiated by VLAN.  Thus, single IRB interface can
   still serve multiple subnet.

   Motivation behind such deployments are

   1.  Manageability: If there is support to have multiple subnets using
       single bridge domain, it would require only one Bridge domain and
       one IRB for "N" subnets compare to "N" Bridge domain and "N" IRB
       interface to manage.

   2.  Simplicity: It avoids extra configuration by configuring Vlan
       Range as compare to individual VLAN, BD and IRB interface per
       subnet.

   Multiple subnet per bridge domain deployments guarantee that there
   would not be duplicate MAC address across subnet.

   [RFC7432] defines three types of service interface.  None of them
   provide flexibility to achieve multiple subnet within single bridge
   domain.  Brief about existing service interface from [RFC7432] are ,

   1.  VLAN-Based Service Interface: With this service interface, an
       EVPN instance consists of only a single broadcast domain (e.g., a
       single VLAN).  Therefore, there is a one-to-one mapping between a
       VID on this interface and a MAC-VRF.

   2.  VLAN Bundle Service Interface: With this service interface, an
       EVPN instance corresponds to multiple broadcast domains (e.g.,
       multiple VLANs); however, only a single bridge table is
       maintained per MAC-VRF, which means multiple VLANs share the same
       bridge table.  The MPLS-encapsulated frames MUST remain tagged
       with the originating VID.  Tag translation is NOT permitted.  The
       Ethernet Tag ID in all EVPN routes MUST be set to 0.

   3.  VLAN-Aware Bundle Service Interface: With this service interface,
       an EVPN instance consists of multiple broadcast domains (e.g.,
       multiple VLANs) with each VLAN having its own bridge table --
       i.e., multiple bridge tables (one per VLAN) are maintained by a
       single MAC-VRF corresponding to the EVPN instance.

   Though from definition it looks like VLAN Bundle Service Interface
   does provide flexibility to support multiple subnet within single
   bridge domain.  But it requirement is to have multiple subnet from
   same ES on multi-homing all active mode, it would not work.  For
   example, lets take the case from Figure-1, If PE1 learns MAC of H1 on
   Vlan 1 (subnet S1).  When MAC route is originated , as per [RFC7432]
   ether tag would be set to 0.  If there is packet coming from IRB
   interface which is untagged packet, and it reaches to PE2, PE2 does
   not have associated AC information.  In this case PE2 can not forward
   traffic which is destined to H1.

   This draft proposes an extension to existing service interface types
   defined in [RFC7432] and defines AC-aware Bundling service interface.
   AC-aware Bundling service interface would provide mechanism to have
   multiple subnets in single bridge domain.  This extension is
   applicable only for multi-homed EVPN peers..

1.1.  Problem with Unicast MAC route processing for multihome case

   BD-1 has multiple subnet where each subnet is distinguished by Vlan
   1, 2 ,3 and 4.  PE1 learns MAC address MAC-1 from AC associated with
   subnet S1.  PE1 uses MAC route to advertise MAC-1 presence to peer
   PEs.  As per [RFC7432] MAC route advertisement from PE1 does not
   carry any context which can provide information about MAC address
   association with AC.  When PE2 receives MAC route with MAC-2 it can
   not determine which AC this MAC belongs too.

   Since PE2 could not bind MAC-1 with correct AC, when it receives data
   traffic destined to MAC-1, it can not find correct AC where data MUST
   be forwarded.

1.2.  Problem with Multicast route synchronization

   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-igmp-mld-proxy] defines mechanism to synchronize
   multicast routes between multihome peer.  In above case if Receiver
   behind S1 send IGMP membership request, CE could hash it to either of
   the PE.  When Multicast route is originated, it does not contain any
   AC information.  Once it reaches to remote PE, it does not have any
   information about which subnet this IGMP membership request belong
   to.

1.3.  Potential Security concern caused by misconfiguration

   In case of single subnet per bridge domain, there is potential case
   of security issue.  For example if PE1 , BD1 is configured with
   Vlan-1 where as multihome peer PE2 has configured Vlan-2.  Now each
   of the IGMP membership request on PE1 would be synchronized to PE2.
   and PE2 would process multicast routes and start forwarding multicast
   traffic on Vlan-2, which was not intended.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] .

   AC: Attachment Circuit.

   ARP: Address Resolution Protocol.

   BD: Broadcast Domain.  As per [RFC7432], an EVI consists of a single
   or multiple BDs.  In case of VLAN-bundle and VLAN-based service
   models (see [RFC7432]), a BD is equivalent to an EVI.  In case of
   VLAN-aware bundle service model, an EVI contains multiple BDs.  Also,
   in this document, BD and subnet are equivalent terms.

   families.  An IP-VRF is also an instantiation of a layer 3 VPN in an
   NVE/PE.

   IRB: Integrated Routing and Bridging interface.  It connects an IP-
   VRF to a BD (or subnet).

   MAC-VRF: A Virtual Routing and Forwarding table for Media Access
   Control (MAC) addresses on an NVE/PE, as per [RFC7432].  A MAC-VRF is

   VRF- to-IP-VRF use-cases (see Section 4.4.).

   SN: Subnet.

   TS: Tenant System.

   VA: Virtual Appliance.

   VNI: Virtual Network Identifier.  As in [RFC8365], the term is used
   as a representation of a 24-bit NVO instance identifier, with the
   understanding that VNI will refer to a VXLAN Network Identifier in
   VXLAN, or Virtual Network Identifier in GENEVE, etc. unless it is
   stated otherwise.

   VTEP: VXLAN Termination End Point, as in [RFC7348].

   VXLAN: Virtual Extensible LAN, as in [RFC7348].

   This document also assumes familiarity with the terminology of
   [RFC7432],[RFC8365], [RFC7365].

3.  Requirements

   1.  Service interface MUST be able to support multiple subnets
       designated by Vlan under single bridge domain.

   2.  Service interface MUST be applicable to Multihomed peers only

Internet-Draft AC-Aware Bundling Service Interface in EVPN February 2020


   Consider the above topology, where AC aware bundling service
   interface is supported.  Host H1 on Vlan-1 has MAC address as MAC-1
   and Host H2 on Vlan 2 has MAC address as MAC-2.

4.1.  Control Plane Operation

4.1.1.  MAC/IP Address Advertisement

4.1.1.1.  Local Unicast MAC learning

   1.  [RFC7432] section 9.1 describes different mechanism to learn
       Unicast MAC address locally.  PEs where AC aware bundling is
       supported, MAC address is learnt along with Vlan associated with
       AC.

   2.  MAC/IP route construction follows mechanism defined in [RFC7432]
       section 9.2.1.  Along with RT-2 it must attach Attachment Circuit
       ID Extended Community (Section 6.1).

   3.  From Figure-2 PE1 learns MAC-1 on S1.  It MUST construct MAC
       route with procedure defined in [RFC7432] section 9.2.1.  It MUST
       attach Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community (Section 6.1).

4.1.1.2.  Remote Unicast MAC learning

   1.  Presence of Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community
       (Section 6.1) MUST be ignored by non multihoming PEs.  Remote PE
       (Non Multihome PE) MUST process MAC route as defined in [RFC7432]

   2.  Multihoming peer MUST process Attachment Circuit ID Extended
       Community (Section 6.1) to attach remote MAC address to
       appropriate AC.

   3.  From Figure-2 PE3 receives MAC route for MAC-1.  It MUST not
       ignore AC information in Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community
       (Section 6.1) which was received with RT-2.

   4.  PE2 receives MAC route for MAC-1.  It MUST get Attachment Circuit
       ID from Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community (Section 6.1) in
       RT-2 and associate MAC address with specific subnet.

4.1.2.  Multicast route Advertisement

4.1.2.1.  Local multicast state

   When a local multihomed bridge port in given BD receives IGMP
   membership request and ES is operating in All-active or Single-Active
   redundancy mode, it MUST synchronize multicast state by originating



Sajassi, et al.          Expires August 21, 2020               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft AC-Aware Bundling Service Interface in EVPN February 2020


   multicast route defined in section 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-igmp-mld-proxy].  When Service interface is AC
   aware it MUST attach Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community
   (Section 6.1) along with multicast route.  For example in Figure-2
   when H2 sends IGMP membership request for (S,G) , CE hashed it to one
   of the PE.  Lets say PE1 received IGMP membership request, now PE1
   MUST originate multicast route to synchronize multicast state with
   PE2.  Multicast route MUST contain Attachment Circuit ID Extended
   Community (Section 6.1) along with multicast route.

   If PE1 had already originated multicast route for (S,G) from subnet
   S2.  Now if host H1 also sends IGMP membership request for (S,G) on
   subnet S1, PE1 MUST originate route update with Attachment Circuit ID
   Extended Community (Section 6.1).

4.1.2.2.  Remote multicast state

   If multihomed PE receives remote multicast route on Bridge Domain for
   given ES, route MUST be programmed to correct subnet.  Subnet
   information MUST be get from Attachment Circuit ID Extended
   Community.  For example PE2 receives multicast route on Bridge Domain
   BD-1 for ES ESI-100, From Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community
   (Section 6.1) it receives AC information and associates multicast
   route (S,G) to subnet S2.

   When PE2 receives route update with Attachment Circuit ID Extended
   Community added for subnet S1, port associated with subnet S1 MUST be
   added for multicast route.

4.2.  Data Plane Operation

4.2.1.  Unicast Forwarding

   1.  Packet received from CE must follow same procedure as defined in
       [RFC7432] section 13.1

   2.  Unknown Unicast packets from a Remote PE MUST follow procedure as
       per [RFC7432] section 13.2.1.

   3.  Known unicast Received on a Remote PE MUST follow procedure as
       per [RFC7432] section 13.2.2.  So in Figure-2 if PE3 receives
       known unicast packet for destination MAC MAC-1, it MUST follow
       procedure defined in [RFC7432] section 13.2.2.

   4.  If destination MAC lookup is performed on known unicast packet,
       destination MAC lookup MUST provide Vlan and Port tuple.  For
       example if PE2 receives unicast packet which is destined to MAC-1
       (packet might be coming from IRB or remote PE with EVPN tunnel),



Sajassi, et al.          Expires August 21, 2020               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft AC-Aware Bundling Service Interface in EVPN February 2020


       destination MAC lookup on PE2 MUST provide outgoing port along
       with associated MAC address.  In this case traffic MUST be
       forwarded to S1 with Vlan 1.

4.2.2.  Multicast Forwarding

   1.  Multicast traffic from CE and remote PE MUST follow procedure
       defined in [RFC7432]

   2.  Multicast traffic received from IRB interface or EVPN tunnel,
       route lookup would be performed based on IGMP snooping state and
       traffic would be forwarded to appropriate AC.

5.  Mis-configuration of VLAN ranges across multihoming peer

   If there is mis-configuration of Vlan or Vlan range across
   multihoming peer, same MAC address would be learnt with different
   Vlan in Bridge Domain.  In this case Error message MUST be thrown for
   operator to make configuration changes.  errored MAC route MUST be
   ignored.

6.  BGP Encoding

   This document defines one new BGP Extended Community for EVPN.

6.1.  Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community

   A new EVPN BGP Extended Community called Attachment Circuit ID is
   introduced here.  This new extended community is a transitive
   extended community with the Type field of 0x06 (EVPN) and the Sub-
   Type of TBD.  It is advertised along with EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement
   Route (Route Type 2) per [RFC7432] for AC-Aware Bundling Service
   Interface.

   The Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community is encoded as an 8-octet
   value as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | Type=0x06     | Sub-Type=TBD  |      Reserved (16 bits)       |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |               Attachment Circuit ID (32 bits)                 |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       Figure 2: Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community

   This extended community is used to carry the Attachment Circuit ID
   associated with the received MAC address and it is advertised along
   with EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route.  The receiving PE who is a
   member of an All-Active multi-homing group uses this information to
   not only synchronize the MAC address but also the associated AC over
   which the MAC addresses is received.

7.  Security Considerations

   The same Security Considerations described in [RFC7432] are valid for
   this document.

8.  IANA Considerations

   A new transitive extended community Type of 0x06 and Sub-Type of TBD
   for EVPN Attachment Circuit Extended Community needs to be allocated
   by IANA.
