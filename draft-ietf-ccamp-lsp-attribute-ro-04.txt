                  draft-ietf-ccamp-lsp-attribute-ro-04

Abstract

   RFC5420 extends RSVP-TE to specify or record generic attributes which
   apply to the whole of the path of an LSP.  This document proposes an
   extension to the RSVP ERO and RRO objects to allow it to specify or
   record generic attributes which apply to a given hop.

1.  Introduction

   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) can be route-constrained by making use of the Explicit
   Route (ERO) object and related sub-objects as defined in [RFC3209],
   [RFC3473], [RFC3477], [RFC4873], [RFC4874], [RFC5520] and [RFC5553].
   Several documents have identified the need for attributes that can be
   targeted at specific hops in the path of an LSP, including [RFC6163],
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-wson-signaling],
   [I-D.dong-ccamp-rsvp-te-mpls-tp-li-lb] or
   [I-D.ali-ccamp-rc-objective-function-metric-bound],. This document
   provides a generic mechanism for use by these other documents.

   RSVP already supports generic extension of LSP attributes in
   [RFC5420].  In order to support current and future ERO constraint

   extensions this document defines a mechanism to define per-Hop
   attributes.

1.1.  Contributing Authors

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Requirements

   The requirement is to provide a generic mechanism to carry
   information related to specific nodes when signaling an LSP.  This
   document does not restrict what that information can be used for.  A
   mechanism similar to LSP attribute defined [RFC5420] should be
   expressed in ERO and SERO objects.  A new ERO sub-object is defined,
   containing a list of generic per-Hop attributes.  The mechanism
   defined in this document limits itself to single HOP attributes, and
   does not address attributes valid for a LSP section [[CREF1: This can
   be revised based on feedback --Ed.]]

3.  Specifying Hop Attribute

   The ERO Attributes subobject may be carried in the ERO or SERO object
   if they are present.  The subobject uses the standard format of an
   ERO subobject.

3.1.  ERO_HOP_ATTRIBUTE subobject

   The length is variable and content is a list of HOP Attributes TLVs
   defined in Section 3.2.  The size of the ERO sub-object limits the
   size of the attribute TLV to 250 bytes.  The typical size of
   currently defined and forthcoming LSP_ATTRIBUTE TLVs applicable to a
   specific hop (WSON_SIGNALING, OF and Metric) is not foreseen to
   exceed this limit.

   The ERO_HOP_ATTRIBUTE subobject is defined as follows:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   See [RFC3209] for a description of L parameters.  The attributes TLV
   are encoded as defined in section Section 3.2.

   Type  x TBD by IANA.

   Length  The Length contains the total length of the subobject in
      bytes, including the Type and Length fields.  The Length MUST be
      always divisible by 4.

   Reserved  Reserved, must be set to 0 when the subobject is inserted
      in the ERO, MUST NOT be changed when a node process the ERO and
      must be ignored on the node addressed by the preceding ERO
      subobjects.

   R  This bit reflects the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE and LSP_ATTRIBUTE
      semantic defined in [RFC5420].  When set it indicates required hop
      attributes to be processed by the node.  When cleared, it
      indicates that the hop attributes are not required as described in
      Section Section 3.3.

   Attributes TLVs  as defined in Section 3.2 .

3.2.  HOP Attributes TLVs

   ERO Attributes carried by the new objects defined in this document
   are encoded within TLVs.  One or more TLVs may be present in each
   object.  There are no ordering rules for TLVs, and no interpretation
   should be placed on the order in which TLVs are received.

   Each TLV is encoded as follows.

   Type  The identifier of the TLV..

   Length  Indicates the total length of the TLV in octets.  That is,
      the combined length of the Type, Length, and Value fields, i.e.,
      four plus the length of the Value field in octets.  The entire TLV
      MUST be padded with between zero and three trailing zeros to make
      it four-octet aligned.  The Length field does not count any
      padding.

   Value  The data carried in the TLV.

3.3.  Procedures

   As described in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473] the ERO is managed as a list
   where each hop information starts with a subobject identifying an
   abstract node or link.  The ERO_HOP_ATTRIBUTE subobject must be
   appended after the existing subobjects defined in [RFC3209],
   [RFC3473], [RFC3477], [RFC4873], [RFC4874], [RFC5520] and [RFC5553].
   Several ERO_HOP_ATTRIBUTE subobject MAY be present, for each hop.

   If a node is processing an ERO_HOP_ATTRIBUTE subobject and does not
   support handling of the subobject it will behave as described in
   [RFC3209] when an unrecognized ERO subobject is encountered.  This
   node will return a PathErr with error code "Routing Error" and error
   value "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" with the EXPLICIT_ROUTE object
   included, truncated (on the left) to the offending unrecognized
   subobject.

   When the R bit is set a node MUST examine the attribute TLV present
   in the subobject following the rules described in [RFC5420] section
   5.2.  When the R bit is not set a node MUST examine the attribute TLV
   present in the subobject following the rules described in [RFC5420]
   section 4.2.

   A node processing an ERO_HOP_ATTRIBUTE subobject with an HOP
   attribute TLV longer than the ERO subobject SHOULD return a PathErr
   with error code "Routing Error" and error value "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE

   object" with the EXPLICIT_ROUTE object included, truncated (on the
   left) to the offending malformed subobject.  The processing of the
   Hop attribute TLVs should be described in the documents defining
   them.

4.  Recording Hop attribute

   In some cases it is important to determine if an optional Hop
   attribute has been processed by a node.

4.1.  RRO_HOP_ATTRIBUTE subobject

   The RRO_HOP_ATTRIBUTE subobject may be carried in the RECORD_ROUTE
   object if it is present.  The subobject uses the standard format of
   an RRO subobject.

   The RRO_HOP_ATTRIBUTE subobject is defined as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

      |                                                               |
      //                      Attributes TLVs                        //
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   See [RFC3209] for a description of L parameters.  The attributes TLV
   are encoded as defined in section Section 3.2.

   Type  x TBD by IANA.

   Length  The Length contains the total length of the subobject in
      bytes, including the Type and Length fields.  The Length MUST be
      always divisible by 4.

   Reserved  Reserved, must be set to 0 when the subobject is inserted
      in the RRO, MUST NOT be changed when a node process the RRO and
      must be ignored on the node addressed by the preceding RRO
      subobjects.

   Attributes TLVs  The processed or addition HOP attributes, using the
      format defined in Section 3.2 .

Internet-Draft         General ERO LSP parameters              July 2014


4.2.  Procedures

4.2.1.  Subobject presence rule

   The RRO rules defined in [RFC3209] are not changed.  The
   RRO_HOP_ATTRIBUTE subobject must be pushed after the RRO attribute
   subobject (if present) defined in in [RFC5420].  The
   RRO_HOP_ATTRIBUTE subobject MAY be present between a pair of
   subobject identifying LSR or links.  All such subobjects MUST be
   forwarded unmodified by transit LSRs.

4.2.2.  Reporting Compliance with ERO Hop Attributes

   To report that an ERO Hop attribute has been considered, or to report
   an additional attribute, an LSR MAY add a RRO_HOP_ATTRIBUTE subobject
   with the HOP Attribute TLV which describes the attribute to be
   reported.  The requirement to report compliance MUST be specified in
   the document that defines the usage of an Hop attribute.  [[CREF2:
   This is not the most efficient encoding, a more efficient encoding
   would use a bit field ala RFC5420 --Ed.]]

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  ERO LSP Attribute Subobject

   IANA is requested to make the following subobject allocations from
   the "EXPLICIT_ROUTE Subobject Type" registry.

                     Sub-object type TBA
                     Name            ERO HOP Attribute
                     Reference       This document

5.2.  RRO LSP Attribute Subobject

   IANA is requested to make the following subobject allocations from
   the "RECORD_ROUTE Subobject Type" registry.

                     Sub-object type TBA
                     Name            RRO HOP Attribute
                     Reference       This document

5.3.  Existing LSP Attribute TLVs

   IANA is request to add the following information for each TLV in the
   RSVP TLV type identifier registry.

   o  Whether allowed on LSP attribute ERO subobject

   The existing registry is modified for existing TLVs.

5.3.1.  Attribute Flags

   The new TLV type definition is as follow

   o  TLV Type = 1

   o  TLV Name = Attribute Flags TLV

   o  Allowed on LSP_ATTRIBUTES object

   o  Allowed on LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object

   o  Allowed on LSP attribute ERO subobject

5.3.2.  Service ID TLV

   The new TLV type definition is as follow

   o  TLV Type = 2

   o  TLV Name = Attribute Flags TLV

   o  Allowed on LSP_ATTRIBUTES object

   o  Not allowed on LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object

   o  ? on LSP attribute ERO subobject

6.  Security Considerations

   None.
