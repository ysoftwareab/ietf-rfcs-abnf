Internet-Draft            application/saml+xml                 June 2004


   1. Introduction

      This document defines a MIME media type -- application/saml+xml --
      for use with the XML serialization of SAML (Security Assertion
      Markup Language) assertions, or other SAML-defined objects.

      The SAML specification sets, SAML V1.0 [5] and SAML V1.1 [9], are
      work products of the OASIS [13] Security Services Technical
      Committee (SSTC) [14]. The SAML specifications define XML-based
      constructs with which one may make, and convey, security
      assertions. For example, one can assert that an authentication
      event pertaining to some subject has occured and convey said
      assertion to a relying party.

      may be employed to discuss usage of the application/saml+xml MIME
      media type.

   1.2 Document Conventions

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
      in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
      [2].

   2. Usage of the application/saml+xml MIME Media Type

      Application protocols capable of conveying MIME entities, such as
      HTTP [3], SHOULD use the media type defined in this document when
      conveying SAML-defined objects.

   3. application/saml+xml MIME Media Type Registration

      This is a media type registration as defined in Multipurpose
      Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four: Registration Procedures
      [1] and XML Media Types [4].

         MIME media type name:

            application

         MIME subtype name:

            saml+xml

         Required parameters:

            none

         Optional parameters: charset

            Same as charset parameter of application/xml.

         Encoding considerations:

            Same as charset parameter of application/xml.

         Security considerations:

            Security considerations include many of those described in
            section 10 of RFC 3023 [4] as well as those specifically
            described in:

               SAML V1.0 Assertions and Protocol [6]

               SAML V1.0 Bindings and Profiles [7]

               SAML V1.0 Security and Privacy Considerations [8]

            ..and/or..

               SAML V1.1 Assertions and Protocol [10]

               SAML V1.1 Bindings and Profiles [11]

               SAML V1.1 Security and Privacy Considerations [12] .

            ..depending on the version of the SAML object (see the next
            item).

         Interoperability considerations:

            SAML assertions are explicitly versioned. Relying parties
            SHOULD ensure that they observe assertion version
            information and behave accordingly. See "Chapter 4  SAML
            Versioning" in SAML V1.0 Assertions and Protocol [6], and/or
            SAML V1.1 Assertions and Protocol [10], as appropriate.

         Published specification:

            See the SAML V1.0 [5] and SAML V1.1 [9] specification sets.

         Applications which use this media type:

            SAML is device-, platform-, and vendor-neutral and is
            supported by a range of server- and client-side applications
            and tools.

         Additional information:

            Magic number(s): none, but..

               Although no byte sequences can be counted on to
               consistently identify SAML objects, i.e. assertions and/
               or protocol messages, they will contain either one, or
               both of, the strings:

                  urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.0:assertion

                  urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.0:protocol

               to identify the SAML XML namespace(s).

            File extension(s):

               none

            Macintosh File Type Code(s):

               none

         Person & email address to contact for further information:

            Use the email distribution lists identified in Section 1.1
            above.

            Additionally, or otherwise, refer to the Security Services
            Technical Committee website [14].

         Intended usage:

            COMMON

         Author/Change controller:

            The SAML specification sets are a work product of the OASIS
            Security Services Technical Committee (SSTC). OASIS and the
            SSTC have change control over the SAML specification sets.


   4. IANA Considerations

      This document calls for registration of a new MIME content-type,
      according to the registration information given above in Section
      3.

   5. Security Considerations

      See the "Security Considerations" item in Section 3 above.

   6. Acknowledgements

      This doc is based on Aaron Schwartz' internet-draft for the
      application/rdf+xml MIME media type [18]. Thanks to Graham Klyne
      for pointing me to the latter, to Scott Cantor and John Kemp for
      volunteering me to write this, and to Marshall Rose for his
      xml2rfc document converter gizmo [17]. Artists whose music
      contributed to the writing of this spec ranged from John Coltrane
      [19] to Trapt [20].
