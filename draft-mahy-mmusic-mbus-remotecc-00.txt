Abstract

   Mbus (Message Bus for Local Coordination) was designed with remote
   call control in mind as an Mbus profile.  This document discusses
   changes necessary to the long abandoned call control profile to
   address recent requrirement, and conditions of use to make the core
   Mbus appropriate for use among SIP systems on the Internet.

1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].

2.  Introduction

   A long-standing charter item of the SIP and SIPPING working groups
   was to design extensions to SIP [1] for
   <http://www.softarmor.com/wgdb/docs/draft-ietf-sipping-cc-framework-03.txt>
   .  In this vein, remote call control [5], the cooperation of a
   handful of loosely coupled user agents was extensively discussed, and
   several suggestions investigated.

   Mbus (Message Bus for Local Coordination) - RFC 3259 [3], is a
   lightweight message-oriented coordination protocol designed for
   inter-application communication.  Mbus was designed to run primarily
   over IP multicast, but also runs over unicast UDP datagrams.
   Unfortunately Mbus was not designed to work in settings where the
   Mbus applications are geographically local, but not topologically
   local.  (For example, a mobile phone with IP connectivity could be
   used as a remote control for a SIP-based video conferencing system
   which happens to be in the same room, but are in very different
   networks and addressing realms).

   Mbus control streams setup via SIP and SDP [9] addresses many of
   these limitations.  This companion document evaluates the possibility
   of resurrecting the long expired
   <http://www.mbus.org/drafts/draft-ietf-mmusic-mbus-call-control-00.html>
   .

3.  Proposed changes to the Mbus call control profile

   The expired call control profile has many events for monitoring
   status which are a close duplicate of the dialog package [6], which
   is more expressive in a SIP environment.  In order to get the best of
   both worlds, the commands and events in the current profile should be
   split into two different profiles.  Note that this also can
   dramatically improve the congestion safety of the overall solution,
   as SIP message over 1300 bytes MUST be sent over congestion-safe
   transports such as TCP.

   The following list proposes a refactoring of the control primitives
   listed in the call control profile.  Several commands are combined or
   eliminated.  In addition, four new commands are added which complete
   a transfer, join two parties, and add and delete parties in an adhoc
   conference.

   make-call (sends an INVITE)
   end-call (sends a BYE, CANCEL, or 603 Declined as appropriate)
   accept (accepts an incoming call)
   alert (returns a 180 Ringing provisional response) - is this needed?
   reject (reject an incoming call with a specific response/reason)

   move (redirect or single-step transfer a call to a specific target URI)
   complete-transfer (replaces two active or held calls with one call
       directly between to two targets -- REFER 1st call to INVITE with
       Replaces the 2nd call)

   hold (invoke the locally defined hold mechanism)
   retrieve (retrieve a call from hold)

   join (merge two calls into one conference)
   add-party (add a party to a conference)
   drop-party (remove a party from a conference)

   In addition to these changes there are some additional features for
   consideration that should probably be in separate profiles.  For
   example, setting volume setting, selected audio device, and Do Not
   Disturb or Forwarding status.  It is unclear if Do Not Disturb should
   be configured via Mbus or via a presence [7]publication [8].

4.  Security Considerations

   To Be Written.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces no requirements for IANA.
