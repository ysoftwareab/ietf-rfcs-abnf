     IGP Extensions for Scalable Segment Routing based Enhanced VPN
                   draft-dong-lsr-sr-enhanced-vpn-07

Abstract

   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN services to support
   some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent
   performance requirements.  VPN+ requires integration between the
   overlay VPN connectivity and the characteristics provided by the
   underlay network.  A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual
   underlay network which has a customized network topology and a set of
   network resources allocated from the physical network.  A VTN could
   be used to support one or a group of VPN+ services.

   This document specifies the IGP mechanisms with necessary extensions
   to advertise the associated topology and resource attributes for
   scalable Segment Routing (SR) based VTNs.  Each VTN can have a
   customized topology and a set of network resources allocated from the
   physical network.  Multiple VTNs may shared the same topology, and
   multiple VTNs may share the same set of network resources on some
   network segments.  A group of resource-aware SIDs are allocated for
   each VTN.  This allows flexible combination of the network topology
   and network resource attributes to build a relatively large number of
   VTNs with a small number of logical topologies.  The proposed
   mechanism is applicable to both Segment Routing with MPLS data plane
   (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).  This
   document also describes the mechanisms of using dedicated VTN-ID in
   the data plane instead of the per-VTN resource-aware SIDs to further
   reduce the control plane overhead.

1.  Introduction

   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to support the
   needs of new applications, particularly the applications that are
   associated with 5G services.  These applications require enhanced
   isolation and have more stringent performance requirements than that
   can be provided with traditional overlay VPNs.  These properties
   require integration between the underlay and the overlay networks.
   [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] specifies the framework of enhanced VPN
   and describes the candidate component technologies in different
   network planes and layers.  An enhanced VPN can be used for 5G
   network slicing, and will also be of use in more generic scenarios.

   To meet the requirement of different enhanced VPN services, a number
   of virtual underlay networks need to be created, each with a
   customized network topology and a set of network resources allocated
   from the physical network to meet the requirement of one or a group
   of VPN+ services.  Such a virtual underlay network is called Virtual
   Transport Network (VTN) in [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn].

   [I-D.ietf-spring-resource-aware-segments] introduces resource-aware
   segments by associating existing type of SIDs with network resource
   attributes (e.g. bandwidth, processing or storage resources).  These
   resource-aware SIDs retain their original functionality, with the
   additional semantics of identifying the set of network resources
   available for the packet processing
   action.[I-D.ietf-spring-sr-for-enhanced-vpn] describes the use of
   resource-aware segments to build SR based VTNs.  To allow the network
   controller and network nodes to perform VTN-specific explicit path
   computation and/or shortest path computation, the group of resource-
   aware SIDs allocated by network nodes to each VTN and the associated
   topology and resource attributes need to be distributed using the
   control plane.

   [I-D.dong-teas-nrp-scalability] analyzes the scalability requirements
   and the control plane and data plane scalability considerations of
   enhanced VPN, more specifically, the scalability of the VTNs.  In
   order to support a relatively large number of VTNs in the network,
   one proposed approach is to separate the topology and resource
   attributes of the VTN in control plane, so that the advertisement and
   processing of each type of attribute could be decoupled.  Multiple
   VTNs may shared the same topology, and multiple VTNs may share the
   same set of network resources on some network segments, while the
   difference in either the topology or resource attributes makes them
   different VTNs.  This allows flexible combination of network topology
   and network resource attributes to build a large number of VTNs with
   a relatively small number of logical topologies.

   This document specifies the IGP control plane mechanisms with
   necessary extensions for scalable SR based VTNs.  The proposed
   mechanism is applicable to both segment routing with MPLS data plane
   (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).  This
   document also describes the mechanisms of using dedicated VTN-ID in
   the data plane instead of the per-VTN resource-aware SIDs to further
   reduce the control plane overhead.

   In general this approach applies to both IS-IS and OSPF, while the
   specific protocol extensions and encodings are different.  In the
   current version of this document, the required IS-IS extensions are
   described.  The required OSPF extensions will be described in a
   future version or in a separate document.

2.  VTN Definition Advertisement

   According to [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn], a VTN is associated with a
   customized network topology and a set of dedicated or shared network
   resources.  Thus a VTN can be defined as the combination of a set of
   network attributes, which include the topology attribute and other
   attributes, such as the network resources.  IS-IS Virtual Transport
   Network Definition (VTND) sub-TLV is used to advertise the definition
   of a VTN.  It is a sub-TLV of the IS-IS Router-Capability TLV 242 as
   defined in [RFC7981].

   The format of IS-IS VTND sub-TLV is as below:

3.  Advertisement of VTN Topology Attribute

   This section describes the mechanisms used to advertise the topology
   attribute associated with SR based VTNs.  Basically the topology of a
   VTN can be determined by the MT-ID and/or the algorithm ID included
   in the VTN definition.  In practice, it could be described using two
   optional approaches.

   The first approach is to use Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) [RFC4915]
   [RFC5120] with the segment routing extensions to advertise the
   topology associated with the SR based VTNs.  Different algorithms MAY
   be used to further specify the computation algorithm or the metric
   type used for path computation within the topology.  Multiple VTNs
   can be associated with the same <topology, algorithm>, and the IGP
   computation with the <topology, algorithm> tuple can be shared by
   these VTNs.

   The second approach is to use Flex-Algo [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo] to
   describe the topological constraints of SR based VTNs on a shared
   network topology (e.g. the default topology).  Multiple VTNs can be
   associated with the same Flex-Algo, and the IGP computation with this
   Flex-Algo can be shared by these VTNs.

3.1.  MTR based Topology Advertisement

   Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) has been defined in [RFC4915] and
   [RFC5120] to create different network topologies in one network.  It
   also has the capability of specifying customized attributes for each
   topology.  The traditional use cases of multi-topology are to
   maintain separate topologies for unicast and multicast services, or
   to create different topologies for IPv4 and IPv6 in a network.  There
   are some limitations when MTR is used with native IP forwarding, the
   considerations about MT based IP forwarding are described in
   [RFC5120].

   MTR can be used with SR-MPLS data plane.  [RFC8667] specifies the IS-
   IS extensions to support SR-MPLS data plane, in which the Prefix-SID
   sub-TLVs can be carried in IS-IS TLV 235 (MT IP Reachability) and TLV
   237 (MT IPv6 IP Reachability), and the Adj-SID sub-TLVs can be
   carried in IS-IS TLV 222 (MT-ISN) and TLV 223 (MT IS Neighbor
   Attribute).

Internet-Draft         IGP Extensions for SR VPN+           January 2022


   MTR can also be used with SRv6 data plane.
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-srv6-extensions] specifies the IS-IS extensions to
   support SRv6 data plane, in which the MT-ID is carried in the SRv6
   Locator TLV.  The SRv6 End SIDs are carried as sub-TLVs in the SRv6
   Locator TLV, and inherit the topology/algorithm from the parent
   locator.  The SRv6 End.X SIDs are carried as sub-TLVs in the IS-IS
   TLV 222 (MT-ISN) and TLV 223 (MT IS Neighbor Attribute), and inherit
   the topology/algorithm from the parent locator.

   These IGP extensions for SR-MPLS and SRv6 can be used to advertise
   and build the topology for a group of SR based VTNs.

   An algorithm ID MAY be used to further specify the computation
   algorithm or the metric type used for path computation within the
   topology.

3.2.  Flex-Algo based Topology Advertisement

   [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo] specifies the mechanisms to provide
   distributed computation of constraint-based paths, and how the SR-
   MPLS prefix-SIDs and SRv6 locators can be used to steer packets along
   the constraint-based paths.

   The Flex-Algo Definition (FAD) can be used to describe the
   topological constraints for path computation on a network topology.
   According to the network nodes' participation of a Flex-Algo, and the
   rules of including or excluding specific Administrative Groups
   (colors) and the Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs), the topology of a
   VTN can be determined using the associated Flex-Algo on a particular
   topology (e.g. the default topology).

   With the mechanisms defined in[RFC8667] [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo],
   prefix-SID advertisement can be associated with a <topology,
   algorithm> tuple, in which the algorithm can be a Flex-Algo.  This
   allows network nodes to use the prefix-SID to steer traffic along
   distributed computed paths according to the identified Flex-Algo in
   the topology.

   [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-srv6-extensions] specifies the IS-IS extensions to
   support SRv6 data plane, in which the SRv6 locators advertisement can
   be associated with a specific topology and a specific algorithm,
   which can be a Flex-Algo.  With the mechanism defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo], The SRv6 locator can be used to steer
   traffic along distributed computed paths according to the identified
   Flex-Algo in the topology.  In addition, topology/algorithm specific
   SRv6 End SID and End.X SID can be used to enforce traffic over the
   LFA computed backup path.

Internet-Draft         IGP Extensions for SR VPN+           January 2022


   Multiple Flex-Algos MAY be defined to describe the topological
   constraints on a shared network topology (e.g. the default topology).

4.  Advertisement of VTN Resource Attribute

   This section specifies the mechanisms to advertise the network
   resource attributes associated with the VTNs.  The mechanism of
   advertising the link resources and attributes associated with VTNs is
   described.  The mechanism of advertising node resources and
   attributes associated with VTNs are for further study.  Two optional
   approaches are described in the following sub-sections: the first
   option is the L2 Bundle [RFC8668] based approach, the second option
   is to extend IGP to advertise per-VTN link TE attributes.

4.1.  Option 1: L2 Bundle based Approach

   On a Layer-3 interface, each VTN can be allocated with a subset of
   link resources (e.g. bandwidth).  A subset of link resources may be
   dedicated to a VTN, or may be shared by a group of VTNs.  Each subset
   of link resource can be represented as a virtual layer-2 member link
   under the Layer-3 interface, and the Layer-3 interface is considered
   as a virtual Layer-2 bundle.  The Layer-3 interface may also be a
   physical Layer 2 link bundle, in this case a subset of link resources
   allocated to a VTN may be provided by one of the physical Layer-2
   member links.

   [RFC8668] describes the IS-IS extensions to advertise the link
   attributes of the Layer 2 member links which comprise a Layer 3
   interface.  Such mechanism can be extended to advertise the
   attributes of each physical or virtual member links, and its
   associated VTNs.

   A new flag "E" (Exclusive) is defined in the flag field of the Parent
   L3 Neighbor Descriptor in the L2 Bundle Member Attributes TLV (25).

                0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
               |P|E|           |
               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   E flag: When the E flag is set, it indicates each member link under
   the Parent L3 link are used exclusively for one or a specific group
   of VTNs, and load sharing among the member links is not allowed.
   When the E flag is clear, it indicates load balancing and sharing
   among the member links are allowed.

Internet-Draft         IGP Extensions for SR VPN+           January 2022


   A new VTN-IDs sub-TLV is carried under the L2 Bundle Attribute
   Descriptors to describe the mapping relationship between the VTNs and
   the virtual or physical member links.  As one or more VTNs may use
   the same set of link resource on a specific network segment, these
   VTN IDs will be advertised under the same virtual or physical member
   link.

   The format of the VTN-IDs Sub-TLV is as below:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      Type     |    Length     |            Flags              |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                           VTN ID #1                           |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      ~                              ...                              ~
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                           VTN ID #n                           |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Where:

   *  Type: TBD

   *  Length: The length of the value field of the sub-TLV.  It is
      variable dependent on the number of VTN IDs included.

   *  Flags: 16 bit flags.  All the bits are reserved for future use,
      which SHOULD be set to 0 on transmission and MUST be ignored on
      receipt.

   *  VTN IDs: One or more 32-bit identifier to identify the VTNs this
      member link belongs to.

   Each physical or virtual member link MAY be associated with a
   different group of VTNs.  Thus each L2 Bundle Attribute Descriptor
   may carry the link local identifier and attributes of only one Layer
   2 member link.  Multiple L2 Bundle Attribute Descriptors will be used
   to carry the attributes and the associated VTN-IDs of all the Layer 2

4.2.  Option 2: Per-VTN Link TE Attributes

   A Layer-3 interface can participate in multiple VTNs, each of which
   is allocated with a subset of the forwarding resources of the
   interface.  For each VTN, the associated resources can be described
   using per-VTN TE attributes.  A new VTN-specific TE attribute sub-TLV
   is defined to advertise the link attributes associated with a VTN.
   This sub-TLV MAY be advertised as a sub-TLV of the following TLVs:

     TLV-22 (Extended IS reachability) [RFC5305]

     TLV-23 (IS Neighbor Attribute) [RFC5311]

     TLV-141 (Inter-AS Reachability Information) [RFC5316]

     TLV-222 (MT ISN) [RFC5120]

     TLV-223 (MT IS Neighbor Attribute) [RFC5311]

   The format of the sub-TLV is shown as below:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   *  Length: The length of the value field of the sub-TLV.  It is
      variable dependent on the length of the Sub-sub-TLVs field.

   *  Flags: 8-bit flags.  All the 8 bits are reserved for future use,
      which SHOULD be set to 0 on transmission and MUST be ignored on
      receipt.

      on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   *  VTN ID Sub-sub-TLV: contains one or more VTN IDs which is
      associated with the same group of TE attributes.

      associated with the VTNs.

   The format of the VTN ID sub-sub-TLV is shown as below:

     ~                              ...                              ~
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Where:

   *  Type: TBD

   *  Length: The length of the value field of the sub-sub-TLV.  It is
      the number of the VTN IDs in the TLV multiplied by 4.

   *  VTN ID: A global significant 32-bit identifier which is used to
      identify a VTN.

   One sub-sub-TLV "VTN bandwidth sub-sub-TLV" is defined in this
   document.  Its format is shown as below:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   Where:

   *  Type: TBD

   *  Length: The length of the value field of the sub-sub-TLV.  It is
      set to 6.

   *  Flags: 8-bit flags.  All the 8 bits are reserved for future use,
      which SHOULD be set to 0 on transmission and MUST be ignored on

   *  Reserved: 8-bit field reserved for future use, SHOULD be set to 0
      on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   *  Bandwidth: The bandwidth allocated to the VTN, encoded in 32 bits
      in IEEE floating point format.

   The VTN-specific Bandwidth sub-sub-TLV is optional.  This sub-sub-TLV
   SHOULD appear once at most in each VTN-specific TE attribute sub-TLV.

5.  Advertisement of VTN specific Data Plane Identifiers

   In order to steer packets to the VTN-specific paths which are
   computed taking the topology and network resources of the VTN as the
   constraints, some fields in the data packet needs to be used to infer
   or identify the VTN the packet belongs to.  As multiple VTNs may
   share the same topology or Flex-Algo, the topology/Flex-Algo specific
   SR SIDs or Locators cannot be used to distinguish the packets which
   belong to different VTNs.  Some additional data plane identifiers
   would be needed to identify the VTN a packet belongs to.

   This section describes the mechanisms to advertise the VTN
   identifiers in different data plane encapsulations.

5.1.  Advertisement of VTN-specific SR-MPLS SIDs

   With SR-MPLS data plane, the VTN identification information can be
   implicitly carried in the VTN-specific SIDs.  Each node SHOULD
   allocate a unique Prefix-SID for each VTN it participates in.  On a
   Layer-3 interface, if each Layer 2 member link is associated with
   only one VTN, the adj-SIDs of the L2 member links could also identify
   the VTNs.  If a member link is associated with multiple VTNs, VTN-
   specific adj-SIDs MAY need to be allocated to help the VTN-specific
   local protection.

   A new VTN-specific prefix-SID sub-TLV is defined to advertise the
   prefix-SID and its associated VTN.  This sub-TLV MAY be advertised as
   a sub-TLV of the following TLVs:

     TLV-135 (Extended IPv4 Reachability) defined in [RFC5305].

     TLV-235 (MT IP Reachability) defined in [RFC5120].

     TLV-236 (IPv6 IP Reachability) defined in [RFC5308].

     TLV-237 (MT IPv6 IP Reachability) defined in [RFC5120].

   The format of the sub-TLV is shown as below:

   Where:

   *  Type: TBD

   *  Length: The length of the value field of the sub-TLV.  It is
      variable dependent on the length of the SID/Index/Label field.

   *  Flags: 16-bit flags.  The high-order 8 bits are the same as in the
      Prefix-SID sub-TLV defined in [RFC8667].  The lower-order 8 bits
      are reserved for future use, which SHOULD be set to 0 on
      transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   *  VTN ID: A 32-bit identifier to identify the VTN this prefix-SID
      associates with.

   *  SID/Index/Label: The same as defined in [RFC8667].

   One or more of VTN-specific Prefix-SID sub-TLVs MAY be carried in the
   Multi-topology IP Reachability TLVs (TLV 235 or TLV 237), the MT-ID
   of the TLV SHOULD be the same as the MT-ID in the definition of these
   VTNs.

   A new VTN-specific Adj-SID sub-TLV is defined to advertise the adj-
   SID and its associated VTN.  This sub-TLV may be advertised as a sub-
   TLV of the following TLVs:

     TLV-22 (Extended IS reachability) [RFC5305]

     TLV-23 (IS Neighbor Attribute) [RFC5311]

     TLV-25 (L2 Bundle Member Attributes) [RFC8668]

     TLV-141 (Inter-AS Reachability Information) [RFC5316]

     TLV-222 (MT ISN) [RFC5120]

     TLV-223 (MT IS Neighbor Attribute) [RFC5311]

   Where:

   *  Type: TBD

   *  Length: The length of the value field of the sub-TLV.  It is
      variable dependent on the length of the SID/Index/Label field.

   *  Flags: 16-bit flags.  The high-order 8 bits are the same as in the
      Adj-SID sub-TLV defined in [RFC8667].  The lower-order 8 bits are
      reserved for future use, which SHOULD be set to 0 on transmission
      and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   *  VTN ID: A 32-bit global identifier to identify the VTN this Adj-
      SID associates with.

   *  SID/Index/Label: The same as defined in [RFC8667].

   One or more VTN-specific Adj-SID sub-TLV MAY be carried in the Multi-
   topology ISN or Multi-topology IS Attribute TLVs (TLV 222 or TLV
   223), the MT-ID of the TLV SHOULD be the same as the MT-ID in the
   definition of these VTNs.

5.2.  Advertisement of VTN-specific SRv6 Locators and SIDs


5.2.1.  VTN-specific SRv6 Locators and End SIDs

   With SRv6 data plane, the VTN identification information can be
   implicitly or explicitly carried in the SRv6 Locator of the
   corresponding VTN, this is to ensure that all network nodes
   (including both the end nodes and the transit nodes) can identify the
   VTN to which a packet belongs to.  Network nodes SHOULD allocate VTN-
   specific Locators for each VTN it participates in.  The VTN-specific
   Locators are used as the covering prefix of VTN-specific SRv6 End
   SIDs, End.X SIDs and other types of SIDs.

   In one possible approach, each VTN-specific Locator is advertised in
   a separate TLV called "VTN specific SRv6 Locator TLV".  Its format is
   shown as below:

   The VTN-specific SRv6 End SIDs are carried in the VTN-specific SRv6
   Locator TLV, and inherits the topology, algorithm and VTN from the
   parent VTN-specific Locator.

   In another possible approach, when a group of VTNs share the same
   topology/algorithm, the topology/algorithm specific Locator is the
   covering prefix of a group of VTN-specific Locators.  Then the
   advertisement of VTN-specific locators can be optimized to reduce the
   amount of Locator TLVs advertised in the control plane.

   A new VTN locator-block sub-TLV under the SRv6 Locator TLV is defined
   to advertise a set of sub-blocks which follows the topology/algorithm
   specific Locator.  Each VTN locator-block value is assigned to one of
   the VTNs which share the same topology/algorithm.

   With the VTN locator-block sub-TLV, the VTN-specific Locator can be
   obtained by concatenating the topology/algorithm specific locator and
   the locator-block value advertised for the VTN.

   The VTN-specific SRv6 End SIDs inherit the topology, algorithm and
   the VTN from the parent VTN-specific Locator.

5.2.2.  VTN-specific SRv6 End.X SIDs

   The SRv6 End.X SIDs are advertised as sub-TLVs of TLV 22, 23, 25,
   141, 222, and 223.  In order to distinguish the End.X SIDs which
   belong to different VTNs, a new "VTN ID sub-sub-TLV" is introduced
   under the SRv6 End.X SID sub-TLV and SRv6 LAN End.X SID sub-TLV
   defined in [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-srv6-extensions].  Its format is shown
   as below:

   Where:

   *  Type: TBD.

   *  Length: the length of the Value field of the TLV.  It is set to 4.

   *  VTN ID: A 32-bit global identifier to identify the VTN this End.X
      SID associates with.

5.3.  Advertisement of Dedicated Data Plane VTN IDs

   As the number of VTNs increases, with the mechanism described in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-for-enhanced-vpn], the number of SR SIDs and SRv6
   Locators allocated for different VTNs would also increase.  In
   network scenarios where the number of SIDs or Locators becomes a
   concern, some data plane optimization may be needed to reduce the
   amount of SR SIDs and Locators allocated.  As described in
   [I-D.dong-teas-nrp-scalability], one approach is to decouple the data
   plane identifiers used for topology based forwarding and the
   identifiers used for the VTN-specific processing.  Thus a dedicated
   data plane VTN-ID could be encapsulated in the packet.  One possible
   encapsulation of VTN-ID in IPv6 data plane is proposed in
   [I-D.dong-6man-enhanced-vpn-vtn-id].  One possible encapsulation of
   VTN-ID in MPLS data plane is proposed in

   [I-D.li-mpls-enhanced-vpn-vtn-id].

   In that case, the VTN-ID encapsulated in data plane can have the same
   value as the VTN-ID in control plane, so that the overhead of
   advertising the mapping between the control plane VTN-IDs and the
   corresponding data plane identifiers could be saved.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no additional security vulnerabilities to
   IS-IS.

   The mechanism proposed in this document is subject to the same
   vulnerabilities as any other protocol that relies on IGPs.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new code point in the "sub-TLVs for TLV
   242 registry".

   Type: TBD1
   Description: Virtual Transport Network Definition

   IANA is requested to assign three new code points in the "sub-TLVs
   for TLVs 22, 23, 25, 141, 222, and 223 registry".

   Type: TBD2
   Description: Virtual Transport Network Identifiers

   Type: TBD3
   Description: VTN-specific TE attribute sub-TLV

   Type: TBD4
   Description: VTN-specific Adj-SID

   IANA is requested to assign two new code points in the "Sub-TLVs for
   TLVs 27, 135, 235, 236 and 237 registry".

   Type: TBD5
   Description: VTN-specific Prefix-SID

   Type: TBD6
   Description: VTN locator-block

   IANA is requested to assign a new code point in the "IS-IS TLV
   Codepoints registry".
