Abstract

   The Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) is designed to
   support remote storage and access of program option, configuration
   and preference information.

ACAP Protocol Specification



1.      Conventions Used in this Document

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

   The protocol syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) notation as specified in [RFC-822] with one exception; the
   delimiter used with the "#" construct is a single space (SPACE) and
   not one or more commas.

   The "::+" extension to the ABNF notation is used to allow
   nonterminals to be defined as a set of alternatives, each alternative
   being defined in a separate lines.  The sequence of productions:

           a ::+ b
           a ::+ c
           a ::+ d

   is equivalent to

           a ::= (b) / (c) / (d)


2.      Protocol Overview

2.1.    Link Level

   The ACAP protocol assumes a reliable data stream such as provided by
   TCP.  When TCP is used, an ACAP server listens on port XXXX.


2.2.    Commands and Responses

   An ACAP session consists of the establishment of a client/server
   connection, an initial greeting from the server, and client/server
   interactions.  These client/server interactions consist of a client
   command, server data, and a server completion result response.

   All interactions transmitted by client and server are in the form of
   lines; that is, strings that end with a CRLF.  The protocol receiver
   of an ACAP client or server is either reading a line, or is reading a
   sequence of octets with a known count followed by a line.





Myers                                                           [Page 1]

2.2.1.  Client Protocol Sender and Server Protocol Receiver

   The client command begins an operation.  Each client command is
   prefixed with a identifier (typically a short alphanumeric string,
   e.g. A0001, A0002, etc.) called a "tag".  A different tag is
   generated by the client for each command.

   There are two cases in which a line from the client does not
   represent a complete command.  In one case, a command argument is
   quoted with an octet count (see the description of literal in String
   under Data Formats); in the other case, the command arguments require
   server feedback (see the AUTHENTICATE command).  In some of these
   cases, the server sends a command continuation request response if it
   is ready for the octets (if appropriate) and the remainder of the
   command.  This response is prefixed with the token "+".

        Note: If, instead, the server detected an error in the
        command, it sends a BAD completion response with tag
        matching the command (as described below) to reject the
        command and prevent the client from sending any more of the
        command.

        It is also possible for the server to send a completion or
        intermediate response for some other command (if multiple
        commands are in progress), or untagged data.  In either
        case, the command continuation request is still pending;
        the client takes the appropriate action for the response,
        and reads another response from the server.

   The protocol receiver of an ACAP server reads a command line from the
   client, parses the command and its arguments, and transmits server
   data and a server command completion result response.


2.2.2.  Server Protocol Sender and Client Protocol Receiver

   Data transmitted by the server to the client come in four forms:
   command continuation requests, command completion results,
   intermediate responses, and untagged responses.

   A command completion request is prefixed with the token "+".

   A command completion result response indicates the success or failure
   of the operation.  It is tagged with the same tag as the client
   command which began the operation.  Thus, if more than one command is
   in progress, the tag in a server completion response identifies the
   command to which the response applies.  There are three possible
   server completion responses: OK (indicating success), NO (indicating



Myers                                                           [Page 2]

Internet DRAFT                    ACAP                     June 11, 1996


   failure), or BAD (indicating protocol error such as unrecognized
   command or command syntax error).

   An intermediate response returns data which can only be interpreted
   within the context of a command in progress.  It is tagged with the
   same tag as the client command which began the operation.  Thus, if
   more than one command is in progress, the tag in an intermediate
   response identifies the command to which the response applies.  A
   tagged response other than "OK", "NO", or "BAD" is an intermediate
   response.

   An untagged response returns data or status messages which may be
   interpreted outside the context of a command in progress.  It is
   prefixed with the token "*".  Untagged data may be sent as a result
   of a client command, or may be sent unilaterally by the server.
   There is no syntactic difference between untagged data that resulted
   from a specific command and untagged data that were sent
   unilaterally.

   The protocol receiver of an ACAP client reads a response line from
   the server.  It then takes action on the response based upon the
   first token of the response, which may be a tag, a "*", or a "+" as
   described above.

   A client MUST be prepared to accept any server response at all times.
   This includes untagged data that it may not have requested.

   This topic is discussed in greater detail in the Server Responses
   section.

2.3.    State and Flow Diagram

   An ACAP server is in one of three states.  Most commands are valid in
   only certain states.  It is a protocol error for the client to
   attempt a command while the command is in an inappropriate state.  In
   this case, a server will respond with a BAD or NO (depending upon
   server implementation) command completion result.


2.3.1.  Non-Authenticated State

   In non-authenticated state, the user must supply authentication
   credentials before most commands will be permitted.  This state is
   entered when a connection starts.







Myers                                                           [Page 3]

2.3.2.  Authenticated State

   In authenticated state, the user is authenticated and most commands
   will be permitted.  This state is entered when acceptable
   authentication credentials have been provided.


2.3.3.  Logout State

   In logout state, the session is being terminated, and the server will
   close the connection.  This state can be entered as a result of a
   client request or by unilateral server decision.

2.4.    Data Formats

   ACAP uses textual commands and responses.  Data in ACAP can be in one
   of several forms: atom, number, string, parenthesized list, or NIL.


2.4.1.  Atom

   An atom consists of one or more non-special characters.





Myers                                                           [Page 4]

Internet DRAFT                    ACAP                     June 11, 1996


2.4.2.  Number

   A number consists of one or more digit characters, and represents a
   numeric value.


2.4.3.  String

   A string is in one of two forms: literal and quoted string.  The
   literal form is the general form of string.  The quoted string form
   is an alternative that avoids the overhead of processing a literal at
   the cost of restrictions of what may be in a quoted string.

   A literal is a sequence of zero or more octets (including CR and LF),
   prefix-quoted with an octet count in the form of an open brace ("{"),
   the number of octets, close brace ("}"), and CRLF.  In the case of
   literals transmitted from server to client, the CRLF is immediately
   followed by the octet data.  In the case of literals transmitted from
   client to server, the client must wait to receive a command
   continuation request (described later in this document) before
   sending the octet data (and the remainder of the command).  [TODO
   describe non-synchronizing literals.]

   A quoted string is a sequence of zero to 1024 7-bit characters,
   excluding CR and LF, with double quote (<">) characters at each end.

   The empty string is respresented as either "" (a quoted string with
   zero characters between double quotes), as {0} followed by CRLF (a
   synchronizing literal with an octet count of 0), or as {0+} followed
   by a CRLF (a non-synchronizing literal with an octet count of 0).

        Note: Even if the octet count is 0, a client transmitting a
        literal must wait to receive a command continuation
        request.



2.4.3.1.        8-bit and Binary Strings

   ACAP implementations MAY transmit 8-bit or multi-octet characters in
   literals, but should do so only when the character set is identified.
   NUL octets are only permitted in the values of attributes whose names
   end with ".bin".

2.5.    Operational Considerations






Myers                                                           [Page 5]

Internet DRAFT                    ACAP                     June 11, 1996


2.5.1.  Untagged Status Updates

   At any time, a server can send data that the client did not request.


2.5.2.  Response when no Command in Progress

   Server implementations are permitted to send an untagged response
   while there is no command in progress.  Server implementations that
   send such responses MUST deal with flow control considerations.
   Specifically, they must either (1) verify that the size of the data
   does not exceed the underlying transport's available window size, or
   (2) use non-blocking writes.


2.5.3.  Autologout Timer

   If a server has an inactivity autologout timer, that timer MUST be of
   at least 30 minutes' duration.  The receipt of ANY command from the
   client during that interval should suffice to reset the autologout
   timer.


2.5.4.  Multiple Commands in Progress

   The client is not required to wait for the completion result response
   of a command before sending another command, subject to flow control
   constraints on the underlying data stream.  Similarly, a server is
   not required to process a command to completion before beginning
   processing of the next command, unless an ambiguity would result
   because of a command that would affect the results of other commands.
   If there is such an ambiguity, the server executes commands to
   completion in the order given by the client.

2.6.    Datasets

   The primary data structure in ACAP is the "dataset", which is a named
   set of entries.  Datasets are named hierarchically, with each
   component of the name being preceeded by a slash ("/") and containing
   one or more characters (other than slash) in the currently selected
   charset.

   Each entry in a dataset is a set of attribute/value pairs.  Each
   attribute is a hierarchical name in the currently selected charset,
   with each component of the name being separated with a period (".").
   There must be exactly one "name" attribute, whose value is unique
   amongst all entries in the dataset.




Myers                                                           [Page 6]

Internet DRAFT                    ACAP                     June 11, 1996


   Entries in a dataset are ordered in a server-determined manner.

   [OPEN ISSUE] With the exception of "name", the same attribute may be
   listed more than once.  The order of values corresponding to the same
   attribute is significant, the order of values corresponding to
   different attriutes is not significant.

   The value is a string containing one or more octets.  The semantics
   of a value are defined by the specification of its attribute.  Values
   of attributes ending in ".bin" contain arbitrary data and are not
   affected by charset selection.  Values of other attributes are
   textual and are in the currently selected charset.
2.6.    Predefined Attributes

   The following attributes are defined by the ACAP protocol.

   name Contains the name of the entry.

   modtime
        Contains the date and time, in UTC, any value in the entry was
        last modified.  This value is automatically updated by the
        server and may not be directly modified by the client.

        The value consists of 14 or more us-ascii digits.  The first
        four indicate the year, the next two indicate the month, the
        next two indicate the day of month, the next two indicate the
        hour (0 - 23), the next two indicate the minute, and the next
        two indicate the second.  Any further digits indicate fractional
        seconds.

3.   Protocol Specification

   ACAP commands and responses are described in this section.  Commands
   are organized first by the state in which the command is permitted,
   then by a general category of command type.

   Command arguments, identified by "Arguments:" in the command
   descriptions below, are described by function, not by syntax.  The
   precise syntax of command arguments is described in the Formal Syntax
   section.

   Some commands cause specific server data to be returned; these are
   identified by "Data:" in the command descriptions below.  See the
   response descriptions in the Responses section for information on
   these responses, and the Formal Syntax section for the precise syntax
   of these responses.  It is possible for server data to be transmitted
   as a result of any command; thus, commands that do not specifically
   require server data specify "no specific data for this command"
   instead of "none".

   The "Result:" in the command description refers to the possible
   tagged status responses to a command, and any special interpretation
   of these status responses.


3.1. Initial Connection

   Upon session startup, the server sends one of two untagged responses:
   ACAP or BYE.  The untagged BYE response is described in section XXX.

3.1.1.  ACAP Response

Data:       capability list

      The untagged ACAP response indicates the session is ready to
      accept commands and contains a space-separated listing of
      capabilities that the server supports.  Each capability is an atom
      name, possibly followed by a string argument in parenthesis.

      ACAP capability names MUST be registered with IANA.  [OPEN ISSUE:
      ESTABLISH REGISTRY].

      Client implementations SHOULD NOT require any capability name, and
      MUST ignore any unknown capability names.

      [TODO: initial capability list: IMPLEMENTATION, CHARSET,
      CONTEXTLIMIT, ORDERINGS]




Myers                                                           [Page 8]

   Example:    S: * ACAP IMPLEMENTATION("ACME v3.5") CHARSET(utf-8)
3.2.        Any State

   The following commands and responses are valid in any state.

3.2.1.  NOOP Command

Arguments:  none

Data:       no specific data for this command (but see below)

Result:     OK - noop completed
            BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The NOOP command always succeeds.  It does nothing.

      Since any command can return a status update as untagged data, the
      NOOP command can be used as a periodic poll for status updates
      during a period of inactivity.  The NOOP command can also be used
      to reset any inactivity autologout timer on the server.

   Example:    C: a002 NOOP
               S: a002 OK NOOP completed


3.2.2.  LOGOUT Command

   Arguments:  none

   Data:       mandatory untagged response: BYE

   Result:     OK - logout completed
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The LOGOUT command informs the server that the client is done with
      the session.  The server must send a BYE untagged response before
      the (tagged) OK response, and then close the network connection.

   Example:    C: A023 LOGOUT
               S: * BYE ACAP Server logging out
               S: A023 OK LOGOUT completed
               (Server and client then close the connection)









Myers                                                           [Page 9]

Internet DRAFT                    ACAP                     June 11, 1996


3.2.3.  OK Response

   Data:       optional response code
               human-readable text

      The OK response indicates an information message from the server.
      When tagged, it indicates successful completion of the associated
      command.  The human-readable text may be presented to the user as
      an information message.  The untagged form indicates an
      information-only message; the nature of the information may be
      indicated by a response code.

   Example:    S: * OK [ALERT] System shutdown in 10 minutes


3.2.4.  NO Response

   Data:       optional response code
               human-readable text

      The NO response indicates an operational error message from the
      server.  When tagged, it indicates unsuccessful completion of the
      associated command.  The untagged form indicates a warning; the
      command may still complete successfully.  The human-readable text
      describes the condition.

   Example:    C: A001 LOGIN fred secret
               S: * NO [ALERT] Dataet "/addressbook/fred" is at 98% of
               quota [TODO-FIX]
               S: A001 OK LOGIN
                  ...
               C: A222 STORE /mailboxes "comp.mail.misc"
               mailbox.creation-time "19951206103412"
               S: A222 NO Permission denied


3.2.5.  BAD Response

   Data:       optional response code
               human-readable text

      The BAD response indicates an error message from the server.  When
      tagged, it reports a protocol-level error in the client's command;
      the tag indicates the command that caused the error.  The untagged
      form indicates a protocol-level error for which the associated
      command can not be determined; it may also indicate an internal

Internet DRAFT                    ACAP                     June 11, 1996


      server failure.  The human-readable text describes the condition.

   Example:    C: ...empty line...
               S: * BAD Empty command line
               C: A443 BLURDYBLOOP
               S: A443 BAD Unknown command


3.2.6.  BYE Response

   Data:       optional response code
               human-readable text

      The untagged BYE response indicates that the server is about to
      close the connection.  The human-readable text may be displayed to
      the user in a status report by the client.  The BYE response may
      be sent as part of a normal logout sequence, or as a panic
      shutdown announcement by the server.  It is also used by some
      server implementations as an announcement of an inactivity
      autologout.

      This response is also used as one of two possible greetings at
      session startup.  It indicates that the server is not willing to
      accept a session from this client.

   Example:    S: * BYE Autologout; idle for too long


3.3.        Non-Authenticated State

   In non-authenticated state, the AUTHENTICATE or LOGIN command
   establishes authentication and enter authenticated state.  The
   AUTHENTICATE command provides a general mechanism for a variety of
   authentication techniques, whereas the LOGIN command uses the
   traditional user name and plaintext password pair.

   Server implementations may allow non-authenticated access to certain
   information.  The convention is to use a LOGIN command with the
   userid "anonymous".  A password is required.  It is implementation-
   dependent what requirements, if any, are placed on the password and
   what access restrictions are placed on anonymous users.

   Once authenticated (including as anonymous), it is not possible to

   In addition to the universal commands (NOOP and LOGOUT), the
   following commands are valid in non-authenticated state: AUTHENTICATE
   and LOGIN.

3.3.1.  AUTHENTICATE Command

   Arguments:  authentication mechanism name

   Data:       continuation data may be requested

   Result:     OK - authenticate completed, now in authenticated state
               NO - authenticate failure: unsupported authentication
                    mechanism, credentials rejected
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid,
                    authentication exchange cancelled

      The AUTHENTICATE command indicates an authentication mechanism,
      such as described in [IMAP-AUTH], to the server.  If the server
      supports the requested authentication mechanism, it performs an
      authentication protocol exchange to authenticate and identify the
      user.  Optionally, it also negotiates a protection mechanism for
      subsequent protocol interactions.  If the requested authentication
      mechanism is not supported, the server should reject the
      AUTHENTICATE command by sending a tagged NO response.  TODO update
      for SASL, specify service name of "acap".

      The authentication protocol exchange consists of a series of
      server challenges and client answers that are specific to the
      authentication mechanism.  A server challenge consists of a
      command continuation request response with the "+" token followed
      by a BASE64 encoded string.  The client answer consists of a line
      consisting of a BASE64 encoded string.  If the client wishes to
      cancel an authentication exchange, it should issue a line with a
      single "*".  If the server receives such an answer, it must reject
      the AUTHENTICATE command by sending a tagged BAD response.

      A protection mechanism provides integrity and privacy protection
      to the protocol session.  If a protection mechanism is negotiated,
      it is applied to all subsequent data sent over the connection.
      The protection mechanism takes effect immediately following the
      CRLF that concludes the authentication exchange for the client,
      and the CRLF of the tagged OK response for the server.  Once the
      protection mechanism is in effect, the stream of command and
      response octets is processed into buffers of ciphertext.  Each
      buffer is transferred over the connection as a stream of octets
      prepended with a four octet field in network byte order that
      represents the length of the following data.  The maximum
      ciphertext buffer length is defined by the protection mechanism.

      The server is not required to support any particular
      authentication mechanism, nor are authentication mechanisms
      required to support any protection mechanisms.  If an AUTHENTICATE



Myers                                                          [Page 12]

      command fails with a NO response, the client may try another
      authentication mechanism by issuing another AUTHENTICATE command,
      or may attempt to authenticate by using the LOGIN command.  In
      other words, the client may request authentication types in
      decreasing order of preference, with the LOGIN command as a last
      resort.

   Example:    S: * ACAP IMPLEMENTATION("Blorfysoft v3.5")
               AUTH(KERBEROS_V4)
               C: A001 AUTHENTICATE KERBEROS_V4

        Note: the line breaks in the first client answer are for
        editorial clarity and are not in real authenticators.


3.3.2.  LOGIN Command

   Arguments:  user name
               password

   Data:       no specific data for this command

   Result:     OK - login completed, now in authenticated state
               NO - login failure: user name or password rejected
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The LOGIN command identifies the user to the server and carries
      the plaintext password authenticating this user.

   Example:    C: a001 LOGIN SMITH SESAME
               S: a001 OK LOGIN completed



3.4.    Searching

   This section describes the SEARCH command, for retrieving data from
   datasets.






Myers                                                          [Page 13]

3.4.1.  SEARCH Command

   Arguments:  dataset or context name
               optional list of modifiers
               search criteria

   Data:       intermediate responses: ENTRY

   Result:     OK - search completed
               NO - search failure: can't perform search
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The SEARCH command identifies a subset of entries in a dataset and
      returns information on that subset to the client.

      The first argument to SEARCH identifies what is to be searched.
      If the string begins with a slash ("/"), it is the name of a
      dataset to be searched, otherwise it is a name of a context that
      was created by a SEARCH command given previously in the session.

      Following that are zero or more modifiers to the search.  Each
      modifier may be specified at most once.  The defined modifiers
      are:

      LIMIT number   Limits the number of intermediate ENTRY responses
                     that the search may generate.  The numeric argument
                     specifies the limit.  If the search matches more
                     entries than the limit, then no ENTRY intermediate
                     responses are returned and the SEARCH command
                     fails, returning the number of matches in a TOOMANY
                     special information token in the tagged NO
                     response.

      MAKECONTEXT nameInstead of returning ENTRY intermediate responses,
                     the SEARCH command creates a context with the name
                     given in the argument to refer to the matching
                     entries.

                     If the SEARCH is successful, the server returns the
                     number of matching entries in a NEWCONTEXT special
                     information token in the tagged OK response.  The
                     context name may then be given as an argument to
                     subsequent SEARCH commands to search the set of
                     matching entries.

                     If a context with the specified name already
                     exists, it is first freed.  If a new context may
                     not be created due to the server's limit on the

                     number of existing contexts, the command fails,
                     returning a TOOMANYCONTEXTS special information
                     token in the tagged NO response.

                     Contexts are discussed in more detail in section
                     XXX.

      RETURN (attribute...)
                     Limits the set of attributes returned in
                     intermediate ENTRY responses to the "name"
                     attribute and those listed in parentheses.  [OPEN
                     ISSUE: wildcards?]

                     If no RETURN modifier is specified,a all attributes
                     are returned.

      SORT (attribute ordering...)
                     Specifies the order in which any resulting ENTRY
                     replies are to be returned to the client.  The SORT
                     modifier takes as an argument a parenthesized list
                     of one or more attribute/ordering pairs.  Attribute
                     lists the attribute to sort on, ordering specifies
                     the name of the collation rule to apply to the
                     values of the attribute.  [OPEN ISSUE: how to deal
                     with multi-valued attributes] [TODO: list
                     predefined orderings, establish registry].
                     Successive attribute/ordering pairs are used to
                     apply ordering of two entries only when all
                     preceeding pairs indicate two entries collate the
                     same.

                     If the SORT modifier is used in conjunction with
                     the MAKECONTEXT modifier, the SORT modifier
                     specifies the ordering of entries in the created
                     context.

                     If no SORT modifier is specified, or none of the
                     attribute/ordering pairs indicates an order to two
                     entries, the server uses the order of the entries
                     that exists in the context or dataset being
                     searched.
      Following the modifiers is the search criteria.  Searching
      criteria consist of one or more search keys.  When multiple keys
      are specified, the result is the intersection (AND function) of
      all the messages that match those keys.  For example, the criteria
      COMPARE +octet modtime "19951206103400" COMPARE -octet modtime
      "19960112000000" refers to all entries modified between 10:34
      December 6 1995 and midnight January 12, 1996.  A search key may

      also be a parenthesized list of one or more search keys (e.g. for
      use with the OR and NOT keys).

      The currently defined search keys are as follows.

COMPARE attribute ordering value
               Entries for which the specified attribute collates using
               the specified ordering the same or later than the
               specified value.

COMPARESTRICT attribute ordering value
               Entries for which the specified attribute collates using
               the specified ordering later than the specified value.

EQUAL attribute ordering value
               Entries for which the specified attribute collates using
               the specified ordering the same as the specified value.

GLOB attribute pattern
               Entries for which the [XXX multiple?] value of the
               specified attribute matches the specified pattern.  [OPEN
               ISSUE: what about ordering?]

GLOBREFERENCE reference pattern
               Entries whose name matches the specified reference and
               pattern, per the semantics of the IMAP4 LIST command
               [IMAP4].  This search key may only be used when searching
               IMAP4 mailbox list datasets.

               dataset or context's ordering.  The lowest-ordered entry
               in the dataset or context is assigned number one, the
               next lowest entry is assigned number two, and so on.  The
               numeric arguments specify the lowest and highest numbers
               to match.

3.4.2.  ENTRY Response

Data:       entry name
            entry data

      The ENTRY intermediate response occurs as a result of a SEARCH or
      LOCK command.  This is the means by which dataset entries are
      returned to the client.  The entry with the given name matches the
      search.  Following the entry name is a set of zero or more
      attribute/value pairs contained in the entry.  If not all
      attribute/value pairs in the entry were returned (due to a RETURN
      directive), the last attribute/value pair is followed by "...".

3.5.    Contexts

   A context is an ordered subset of entries in a dataset, created by a
   SEARCH command with a MAKECONTEXT modifier.  Context names are
   client-generated strings and must not start with the slash ('/')
   character.

   Contexts only have scope within the ACAP session they were created.
   There is a server-imposed limit on the number of contexts that may
   exist at one time within a session.  The minimum value for this limit
   is 5, if the server supports a larger limit it must advertise it in a
   CONTEXTLIMIT capability.


3.5.1.  FREECONTEXT Command

   Arguments:  context name

   Data:       no specific data for this command

   Result:     OK - freecontext completed
               NO - freecontext failure: no such context
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The FREECONTEXT command causes the server to free all state
      associated with the named context.  The context may no longer be
      searched and the server will no longer issue any untagged
      responses for the context.  The context is no longer counted
      against the server's limit on the number of contexts.

   Example:    C: A683 FREECONTEXT blurdybloop
               S: A683 OK Freecontext completed






Myers                                                          [Page 17]

3.5.2.  NOTIFYCONTEXT Command

   Arguments:  context name
               list of attributes

   Data:       untagged responses: ADDTO REMOVEFROM CHANGE

   Result:     OK - Notifycontext completed: notifications  enabled  for
               context
               NO - Notifycontext failed: no such context
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The NOTIFYCONTEXT command requests the server send untagged ADDTO,
      REMOVEFROM, and CHANGE responses for the specified context,
      notifying the client of how the results of the SEARCH command that
      created the context would change due to modifications that have
      been made to the dataset.  Following the context name is the list
      of attributes to be returned in ADDTO and CHANGE responses for the
      context.

      [OPEN ISSUE: NOTIFYCONTEXT on contexts created from contexts, when
      the parent context has been given to the FREECONTEXT or
      NOTIFYCONTEXT command.]

      The server may issue untagged ADDTO, REMOVEFROM, or CHANGE
      notifications for a context at any time between the issuing of the
      NOTIFYCONTEXT command for the context and the completion of a
      FREECONTEXT command for the context.

      The client may issue a subsequent NOTIFYCONTEXT command for the
      same context, this has the effect of changing the list of
      attributes included in ADDTO and CHANGE responses for the context.

   Example:    C: Z4S9 NOTIFYCONTEXT blurdybloop
               S: Z4S9 OK notifications enabled for context


3.5.3.  ADDTO Response

   Data:       context name
               entry name
               position
               attribute/value list

      The untagged ADDTO response informs the client that an entry has
      been added to a context.  The response includes the position
      number of the added entry (the first entry in the context is
      numbered 1) and those attribute/value pairs contained in the entry



Myers                                                          [Page 18]

      which match attributes specified in the last NOTIFYCONTEXT command
      for the context.

   Example:    S: * ADDTO blurdybloop fred 15


3.5.4.  REMOVEFROM Response

   Data:       context name
               entry name
               old position

      The untagged REMOVEFROM response informs the client that an entry
      has been removed from a context.  The response includes the
      position number that the removed entry used to have (the first
      entry in the context is numbered 1).

   Example:    S: * REMOVEFROM blurdybloop fred 15


3.5.5.  CHANGE Response

   Data:       context name
               entry name
               old position
               new position
               attribute/value list

      The untagged CHANGE response informs the client that an entry in a
      context has either changed position in the context or has changed
      the values of one or more of the attributes specified in the last
      NOTIFYCONTEXT command for the context.

      The response includes the previous and current position numbers of
      the entry (the first entry in the context is numbered 1) and those
      attribute/value pairs contained in the entry which match
      attributes specified in the last NOTIFYCONTEXT command for the
      context.

   Example:    S: * CHANGE blurdybloop fred 15 10

3.6.    Dataset modification

   The following commands and responses handle modification of datasets.

3.6.1.  STORE Command

   Arguments:  dataset name
               entry name
               attribute/value list

   Data:       no specific data for this command

   Result:     OK - store completed
               NO - store failure: can't store that name
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      Creates or modifies the named entry in the named dataset.  The
      values of attributes not specified in the command are not changed.
      Setting the value of an attribute to the null string removes the
      attribute from the entry.

      The reserved attribute "name" may not be included in the
      attribute/value list.

   Example:    C: A342 STORE Fred "Barney Rubble" addressbook.phone
               "555" addressbook.email ""

   Data:       no specific data for this command

   Result:     OK - delete completed
               NO - delete failure: can't delete that entry
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      Removes the named entry from the named dataset.

3.6.3.  DELETEDSINCE Command

   Arguments:  dataset name
               time

   Data:       untagged response: DELETEDFROM

   Result:     OK - Deletedfrom completed
               NO - Deletedfrom failure: can't read dataset
                    date too far in the past
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The DELETEDFROM command returns in untagged [OPEN ISSUE:
      intermediate?] DELETEDFROM replies the names of entries that have
      been deleted from the named dataset since the given time.

      Servers may impose a limit on the number or age of deleted entry
      names they keep track of.  If the server does not have information
      going back to the specified time, the command fails, returning a
      TOOOLD special information token in the tagged NO response.

   Example:    C: Z4S9 DELETEDSINCE /mailboxes 19951205103412

3.8.    Access Control Lists

   An access control list is a set of <identifier,rights> pairs.

   Identifier is a US-ASCII string.  The identifier anyone is reserved
   to refer to the universal identity (all authentications, including



Myers                                                          [Page 21]

   anonymous).  All user name strings accepted by the LOGIN or
   AUTHENTICATE commands to authenticate to the ACAP server are reserved
   as identifiers to refer to the corresponding user.  All other
   identifier strings have implementation-defined semantics.

   Possible variations of identifier interpretation include, but are not
   limited to:

   * Named groups of users, presumably managed by some
     authorization service.

   * A prefix to the identifier specifying an "authentication
     type".

   * Whether the union of rights for matching identifiers are granted
     to a user or whether the rights for the most specific matching
     identifier is granted.

     As an example, for a mailbox with the following ACL:

     user                  ra
     group-user-is-in      rw

     One implementation may grant the user 'rwa' rights, another
     may only grant the user 'ra' rights.

   * A prefix to an identifier name specifying the listed rights
     are to be removed from users who match the prefixed identifier.

     As an example, for a mailbox with the following ACL:

     group-user-is-in      rw
     -user                 w

     An implementation may grant the user 'r' rights.

   Rights is a string listing a (possibly empty) set of alphanumeric
   characters, each character listing a set of operations which is being
   controlled.  Letters are reserved for ``standard'' rights, listed
   below.  Digits are reserved for implementation or site defined
   rights.  The standard rights are:

   r - read
   w - write
   a - administer (perform SETACL)

   An implementation may force rights to always or never be granted.
   [Mention that rights may not be tied, as they can be in IMAP?]



Myers                                                          [Page 22]

   Each attribute of each entry of a dataset may potentially have an
   ACL.  If an attribute in an entry does not have an ACL, then access
   is controlled by a default ACL for that attribute in the dataset, if
   it exists.  If there is no default ACL for that attribute in the
   dataset, access is controlled by a default ACL for that dataset.  The
   default ACL for a dataset must exist.

   In order to perform any manipulation on an entry on a dataset, the
   client must have 'r' rights on the "name" attribute of the entry.

   [OPEN ISSUE: l, i, c, and/or d rights which only apply at the dataset
   level?  'l' could be implemented by the 'r' right on the 'name'
   attribute of that dataset's entry in the dataset list.]

   Many of the ACL commands and responses include an ``acl object''
   parameter, for specifying what the ACL applies to.  This is a
   parenthesized list.  The list contains just the dataset name when
   referring to the default ACL for a dataset.  The list contains a
   dataset name and an attribute name when referring to the default ACL
   for an attribute in a dataset.  The list contains a dataset name, an
   attribute name, and an entry name when referring to the ACL for an
   attribute of an entry of a dataset.


3.8.1. SETACL    Command

   Arguments:  acl object
               authentication identifier
               access rights

   Data:       no specific data for this command

   Result:     OK - setacl completed
               NO - setacl failure: can't set acl
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The SETACL command changes the access control list on the
      specified object so that the specified identifier is granted the
      permissions enumerated in rights.  If the object did not
      previously have an access control list, it does now.











Myers                                                          [Page 23]

3.8.2. DELETEACL         Command

   Arguments:  acl object
               optional authentication identifier

   Data:       no specific data for this command

   Result:     OK - deleteacl completed
               NO - deleteacl failure: can't delete acl
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      If given the optional identifier argument, the DELETEACL command
      removes any portion of the access control list on the specified
      object for the specified identifier.

      If not given the optional identifier argument, the DELETEACL
      command removes the ACL from the object entirely, causing access
      to be controlled by a higher-level default ACL.  It is an error to
      use this form of the DELETEACL command on the default ACL for a
      dataset.


3.8.3. GETACL    Command

   Arguments:  acl object

   Data:       untagged responses: ACL

   Result:     OK - getacl completed
               NO - getacl failure: can't get acl
                    acl does not exist
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The GETACL command returns the access control list for the
      specified object in an untagged ACL reply.  If the specified
      object does not have an ACL, the command fails, returning a NOACL
      special information token in the tagged NO response.

   Example:    C: A002 GETACL ("/mailboxes")
               S: * ACL ("/mailboxes") anyone r
               S: A002 OK Getacl complete

3.8.4. LISTRIGHTS        Command

   Arguments:  acl object
               authentication identifier

   Data:       untagged responses: LISTRIGHTS

   Result:     OK - listrights completed
               NO - listrights failure: can't get rights list
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The LISTRIGHTS command takes an object and an identifier and
      returns information about what rights may be granted to the
      identifier in the ACL for the object.

   Example:    C: a001 LISTRIGHTS ("/mailboxes") smith
               S: * LISTRIGHTS ("/mailboxes") smith r w
               S: a001 OK Listrights completed


               C: a005 LISTRIGHTS ("/mailboxes" archive.imap) anyone

               S: a005 OK Listrights completed


3.8.5. MYRIGHTS  Command

   Arguments:  acl object

   Data:       untagged responses: MYRIGHTS

   Result:     OK - myrights completed
               NO - myrights failure: can't get rights
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The MYRIGHTS command returns the set of rights that the user has
      to the given object in an untagged MYRIGHTS reply.


   Example:    C: A003 MYRIGHTS ("/mailboxes")
               S: * MYRIGHTS ("/mailboxes") r

3.8.6. ACL       Response

   Data:       acl object
               zero or more identifier rights pairs

      The ACL response occurs as a result of a GETACL command.  The
      first list is the object for which this ACL applies.  This is
      followed by zero or more pairs of strings, each pair contains the
      identifier for which the entry applies followed by the set of
      rights that the identifier has.


3.8.7. LISTRIGHTS        Response

   Data:       acl object
               identifier
               required rights
               list of optional rights

      The LISTRIGHTS response occurs as a result of a LISTRIGHTS
      command.  The first two arguments are the object and identifier
      for which this rights list applies.  Following the identifier is a
      string containing the (possibly empty) set of rights the
      identifier will always be granted in the mailbox.

      Following this are zero or more strings each containing a single
      right the identifier may be granted in the mailbox.

      The same right may not be listed more than once in the LISTRIGHTS
      command.


3.8.8. MYRIGHTS  Response

   Data:       acl object
               rights

      The MYRIGHTS response occurs as a result of a MYRIGHTS command.
      The first string is the object for which these rights apply.  The
      second string is the set of rights that the client has.
3.9.    Advisory locking

   These commands allow cooperating clients to synchronize their updates
   to datasets.

3.9.1.  LOCK Command

   Arguments:  dataset name
               optional list of entry names
               optional list of attribute names

   Data:       intermediate responses: ENTRY

   Result:     OK - lock completed
               NO - lock failure: can't lock dataset/entry
                    some other client has obtained lock on dataset/entry
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The LOCK command accepts as arguments a dataset name and an
      optional list of entry names.  It attempts to acquire an exclusive
      semaphore on each of the entries in the dataset.  The dataset must
      exist, but the named entries need not.  If the optional list of
      entry names is not present, it attempts to acquire an exclusive
      semaphore on the dataset as a whole.

      If the command is successful, the server must ensure that no other
      client will be able to successfully lock either any of the named
      entries in the dataset or the dataset as a whole until the
      successful client either performs a matching UNLOCK command or
      closes the connection.  If the optional list of entry names is not
      present, the server must also ensure that no other client will be
      able to lock any entry in the in the dataset.

      If some other client has obtained either the semaphore on the
      dataset as a whole or a semaphore on one of the named entries, the
      command fails, returning a LOCKED special information token in the
      tagged NO response.

      If the command is successful and the optional list of attributes
      is present, the server returns the values of those attributes of
      those entries in intermediate ENTRY responses.

      The server should ensure that the client has permission to perform
      a STORE operation on at least one attribute of each of the
      entries.  [OPEN ISSUE: what is necessary in order to LOCK the
      entire dataset--at least one entry or all entries?]

      Even though other clients may not perform a LOCK operation on an
      entry, servers should not prevent them from performing STORE

               (addressbook.email)
               S: A069 ENTRY barney addressbook.email "barney@bedrock"
               S: A069 OK Lock completed
               C: A070 LOCK "/addressbook/shared" ("Bam Bam")
               S: A070 NO [LOCKED] Locked by Barney on client7.do.main


3.9.2.  UNLOCK Command

   Arguments:  dataset book name
               optional list of entry names

   Data:       no specific data for this command

   Result:     OK - unlock completed
               NO - unlock failure: can't unlock that dataset/entry
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The UNLOCK command accepts as an arguments a dataset name and an
      optional list of entry names.  If the list of entry names is
      present, it releases any semaphores the client may have previously
      obtained on those entries by using the LOCK command.  If the list
      of entry names is not present, it removes any semaphore the client
      may have on the dataset as a whole or on any entry in the dataset.

3.x.    Server Responses - Status Responses

   [TODO - put this somewhere reasonable]

   Status responses may include an optional response code.  A response
   code consists of data inside square brackets in the form of an atom,
   possibly followed by a space and arguments.  The response code
   contains additional information or status codes for client software
   beyond the OK/NO/BAD condition, and are defined when there is a
   specific action that a client can take based upon the additional
   information.

   The currently defined response codes are:

      ALERT          The human-readable text contains a special alert
                     that MUST be presented to the user in a fashion
                     that calls the user's attention to the message.

      LOCKED         The option or address book entry is already locked
                     by another client.

      TOOMANY        TODO

      NEWCONTEXT     TODO

      TOOMANYCONTEXTSTODO

      NOACL          TODO

      Additional response codes defined by particular client or server
      implementations should be prefixed with an "X" until they are
      added to a revision of this protocol.  Client implementations
      should ignore response codes that they do not recognize.



3.x     Server Responses - Command Continuation Request

   [TODO - put this somewhere reasonable]

   The command completion request response is indicated by a "+" token
   instead of a tag.  This form of response indicates that the server is
   ready to accept the continuation of a command from the client.  The
   remainder of this response is a line of text.

   This response is used in the AUTHENTICATE command to transmit server
   data to the client, and request additional client data.  This
   response is also used if an argument to any command is a literal.



Myers                                                          [Page 29]

Internet DRAFT                    ACAP                     June 11, 1996


   The client is not permitted to send the octets of a synchronizing
   literal unless the server indicates that it expects it.  This permits
   the server to process commands and reject errors on a line-by-line
   basis.  The remainder of the command, including the CRLF that
   terminates a command, follows the octets of the literal.  If there
   are any additional command arguments the literal octets are followed
   by a space and those arguments.

   [TODO - modify above to describe server processing of non-
   synchronizing literals]

   Example:    C: A001 LOGIN {11}
               S: + Ready for additional command text
               C: FRED FOOBAR {7}

5.      Dataset Shadowing

   It is possible for a dataset to ``shadow'' another.  Data in the
   shadowed dataset appears in the shadowing dataset, except where
   explicitly overridden by data in the shadowing dataset.  The shadowed
   dataset specifies which values may be overridden in shadowing
   datasets.  [OPEN ISSUE: how does it specify?]

   The shadowed dataset is usually a system-wide set of defaults.  The
   system-wide dataset usually has one shadowing dataset per user,
   allowing each user to add to or modify the defaults as appropriate.

   [TODO: What else to say?  Which datasets shadow other datasets is
   mostly implementation-defined.]

9.      Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) notation as specified in [RFC-822] with one exception; the
   delimiter used with the "#" construct is a single space (SPACE) and
   not one or more commas.

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are
   case-insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to
   define token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations

10.     Security Considerations

   ACAP protocol transactions, including address book and option data,
   are sent in the clear over the network unless the optional privacy
   protection is negotiated in the AUTHENTICATE command.

   Use of the LOGIN command sends passwords in the clear.  This can be
   avoided by using the AUTHENTICATE command instead.

   Additional security considerations are discussed in the section
   discussing the AUTHENTICATE and LOGIN commands.
