Abstract

   This draft documents the use of MCoA (Multiple Care-of Address)
   method defined in [4] in order to facilitate a Make Before Break
   within the Mobile IPv6 protocol [1] .  This draft is intended to
   document the usage of MCoA for achieving Make Before Break behavior.
   The current base Mobile IPv6 specification [1] doesn't include MCoA.
   With that draft currently under consideration it is possible to use
   these extensions for MBB.

1.  Introduction

   Make before break (MBB) schemes are likely to depend on the viability
   of receiving packets over multiple communications links during the
   handover.  In a make-before-break scenario, the MN is, for a given
   period of time, reachable at both the old and the new IP address.  A
   way to achieve this is through the use of registering Multiple
   Care-of Addresses simultaneously [3] .  A method already exists in
   MCoA [4] to register more than one care-of address.

   As has been discussed IEEE Std 802.16e-2005 defines a make-before-
   break HO as a HO where service with the target BS starts before
   disconnection of the service with the previous serving BS.  In this
   standard different HO options are specified including macro diversity
   handover (MDHO) which should allow for the make-before-break feature
   as during HO in the downlink two or more BSs are transmitting the
   same MAC/PHY protocol data unit PDU) and in the uplink (UL) two or
   more BSs are receiving the same PDU from the MS, such that diversity
   combining of the received PDU can be performed as well at the MS as
   among the BSs.

   Make-before-break connections deliver seamless mobile networking for
   voice, video and data applications


2.  Terminology

   See [2] for mobility terminology used in this document.


3.  MCoA for MBB

   Mobile IPv6 [1] defines a process during which a mobile node sends a
   Binding Update to its home agent or a correspondent node, causing a
   binding for the mobile node to be registered.  To achieve an inherit
   Make Before Break Algorithm within the core Mobile IPv6 protocol, the
   HA needs to be able to continue to receive packets from the old and
   new points of attachment (CoA in MIP) at the IP level, for which
   multiple bindings are required.  Note that this is different from bi-
   casting - there is no need to send duplicate packets down multiple
   interfaces (that could be an option, but certainly not required).  A
   draft already exist to register multiple care-of addresses for Mobile
   IPv6 [1] [4] .  With MBB it is required to have 2 interfaces active
   at the same time.  MCoA With MCoA draft [4] the MN registers its
   Care-of Addresses by sending a Binding Update with a Binding Unique
   Identifier sub-option This means that during handoff, a mobile node
   maintains two independent conversations with two access routers at
   the same time.  Even after what can be lengthy outages, Mobile IPv6

   will ensure that IP connectivity is reestablished.  Using Mobile IPv6
   with MBB will allow operators can build a single network to support
   several different wireless technologies that use the same mobility
   management system and MBB handoff throughout.


4.  Timeout for the MIPv6 bindings

   The Home Agent needs to know which binding to forward the continued
   traffic flow to.  This amounts to begin forwarding to the new CoA
   once the new interface is up and connected.  The old binding should
   time-out once this connection is up and running.  This can be done by
   sending a binding update with lifetime 0 to the HA for the old
   interface once it is no longer required or to find an appropriate
   time-out to allow this binding entry to expire naturally when the
   continued traffic flow is moved to the new CoA (or new interface).


5.  Security Considerations

   If a MCoA is used for achieving MBB, then identity spoofing and
   injecting traffic may occur since an adversary can use a nearly
   arbitrary endpoint identifier to achieve the desired result.


6.  Conclusion

   This document uses MCoA [4] as a recipe for adding Make Before Break
   to the core Mobile IPv6 specification.  Make Before Break is used as
   a technique used to non-intrusively alter the path of a Mobile IPv6
   flow.  Existing Mobile IP based mobility algorithms not sufficient
   for make-before-break handoff mechanisms.  MCoA and the unique
   Binding Identifier suboption provides a recipe for achieving MBB in
   the base Mobile IPv6 protocol.  Tear down of the binding cache entry
   for the previous interface can be done through sending a BU with
   lifetime of 0 or allowing this entry to expire within a desired
   timeframe.
