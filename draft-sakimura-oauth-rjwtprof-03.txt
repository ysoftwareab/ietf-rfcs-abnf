1.  Introduction

   OAuth 2.0 Proof-of-Possession (PoP) Security Architecture [POPA]
   identifies Sender Constraint and Key Confirmation as a possible
   threat mitigation against the use of token by an unauthorized
   presenter.  While Proof-Of-Possession Semantics for JSON Web Tokens
   (JWTs) [POPS] touches briefly on the Sender Constraint, it is only
   one paragraph within a introductory text and does not discuss it in
   detail.  Instead, it devotes much of the discussion to the Key
   Confirmation method.  It also is making the usage of such token
   against the resource out of scope.

   This discussion draft describes a way to express the Sender
   Constraint in the JWT, as well as one possible way of using it to
   access a protected resource.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   Unless otherwise noted, all the protocol parameter names and values
   are case sensitive.

2.  Terminology

   For the purpose of this document, the terms defined in RFC6749
   [RFC6749] is used.  In addition, following term is defined.

   Authorized Presenter  Party that the token is intended to be used by.

3.  Sender Constraint Representation

   Sender Constraint is expressed by including the following member at
   the top level of JWT payload.

   azp  The Client ID of the Authorized Presenter.

   Follwoing is an example of such JWT payload.

        {
         "iss": "https://server.example.com",
         "sub": "joe@example.com",
         "azp": "clientID-1342050",
         "aud": "https://client.example.org",
         "exp": "1361398824",
         "nbf": "1360189224",
        }


   Figure 3-1 Example of Sender Constrained JWT.

4.  Client Authentication

   The resource that supports this specification MUST authenticate the
   Client.  In this document a possible method is proposed as follows:

   1.  The authorized presenter issues a HEAD or GET request to the
   resource.

   GET /resource/1234 HTTP/1.0
   Host: server.example.com

   2.  The resource returns a HTTP 401 response with "WWW-Authenticate"
   header with "Named" scheme, whcih includes nonce.

   HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized
   Server: HTTPd/0.9
   Date: Wed, 14 March 2015 09:26:53 GMT
   WWW-Authenticate: Named nonce="dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093"

   3.  The client creates JWS compact seriarization over the nonce.

   4.  The client sends the request to the resource, this time with
   Authorize: header with Named scheme and access token and the JWS.

   GET /resource/1234 HTTP/1.0
   Host: server.example.com
   Authorization: Named at="access.token.jwt", s="jws.of.nonce"

   5.  The resource server finds the client key corresponding to the
   value of "azp" in the access token.  It may have been obtained
   through client registration at the Issuer.

   6.  The resource server creates the JWS of the nonce and compare it
   with the value of "s" of the Authorization header.  If it fails, the
   process stops here and the resource access MUST be denied.

   7.  The resource server MUST verify the access token.  If it is
   valid, the resource SHOULD be returned as HTTP resonse.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  JSON Web Token Claim Registration

   This specification registers the Destination Claim defined herein in
   the IANA JSON Web Token Claims registry defined in [I-D.ietf-oauth-
   json-web-token].

5.2.  Registry Request Contents

      o Claim Name: "azp"

      o Claim Description: The Client ID of the Authorized Presenter

      o Change Controller: IESG

      o Specification Document(s): Section 3 of this document

6.  Security Considerations

   Needless to say, the client's secret key must be kept securely.

7.  Acknowledgements

   TBD
