              Representing CoRE Groupcomm Formats in CBOR
                  draft-bormann-core-groupcomm-cbor-00

Abstract

   Group Communication for the Constrained Application Protocol
   (RFC7390) defines a number of JSON formats for controlling
   communication between groups of nodes employing the Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP).  This specification defines CBOR
   variants of these formats.

1.  Introduction

   (See abstract for now.)

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] when they appear in ALL CAPS.  These words may also appear
   in this document in lower case as plain English words, absent their
   normative meanings.

   The term "byte" is used in its now customary sense as a synonym for
   "octet".

2.  Group Communication Management Objects in CBOR

2.1.  Background

   The CoAP Group Communications specification [RFC7390] defines group
   management objects in JSON format.  These objects are used to
   represent IP multicast group information for CoAP endpoints.  See
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory] for more examples of using these
   objects.

2.2.  Information Model

   This section discusses the information model underlying the CoAP
   Group Communication management object payload.

   A group membership JSON object contains one or more key/value pairs,
   and represents a single IP multicast group membership for the CoAP
   endpoint.  Each key/value pair is encoded as a member of the JSON
   object, where the key is the member name and the value is the
   member's value.

   The information model of the CoAP Group Communication management
   object can be summarized in CDDL [I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl]
   below:

   collection = { * index => membership }
   index = tstr .regexp "[A-Za-z0-9]{1,2}"
   membership = {
     ? n: groupname,
     ? a: groupaddress,
   }
   groupname = tstr    ; host [":" port]
   groupaddress = tstr ; IPv4address [ ":" port ]
                       ; / "[" IPv6address "]" [":" port ]

               Figure 1: CoAP Group Communication Data Model

2.3.  Mapping

   The objective of the mapping defined in this section is to map
   information from the JSON formats specified in [RFC7390] into CBOR
   format, using the rules of Section 4.2 of [RFC7049].
