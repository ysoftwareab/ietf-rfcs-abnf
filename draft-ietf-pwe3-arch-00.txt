1.  Introduction

   This document describes an architecture for Pseudo Wire Emulation
   Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) in support of [XIAO].  It discusses the emulation
   of services (such as Frame Relay, ATM, Ethernet TDM and SONET/SDH)
   over packet switched networks (PSNs) using IP or MPLS.  It presents
   the architectural framework for pseudo wires (PWs), defines
   terminology, specifies the various protocol elements and their
   functions.

1.1  Pseudo Wire Definition

   PWE3 is a mechanism that emulates the essential attributes of a
   service (such as a T1 leased line or Frame Relay) over a PSN. PWE3 is
   intended to provide only the minimum necessary functionality to
   emulate the wire with the required degree of faithfulness for the
   given service definition. Any required switching functionality is the
   responsibility of a forwarder function (FWRD).  Any translation or
   other operation needing knowledge of the payload semantics is carried
   out by native service processing (NSP) elements.  The functional
   definition of any FWRD or NSP elements is outside the scope of PWE3.

   The required functions of PWs include encapsulating service-specific
   bit-streams, cells or PDUs arriving at an ingress port, and carrying
   them across a path or tunnel. In some cases it is necessary to
   perform other operation such as managing their timing and order, to
   emulate the behavior and characteristics of the service to the
   required degree of faithfulness.

   From the perspective of a Customer Edge Equipment (CE), the PW is
   characterised as an unshared link or circuit of the chosen service.
   In some cases, there may be deficiencies in the PW emulation that
   impact the traffic carried over a PW, and hence limit the
   applicability of this technology.  These limitations must be fully
   described in the appropriate service-specific documentation. It is
   possible that these limitations may lead to the definition of more
   than one PW emulation method, each providing a different degree of
   faithfulness.

1.2  PW Service Functionality

   PWs provide the following functions in order to emulate the behavior
   and characteristics of the native service.
       o Encapsulation of service-specific PDUs or circuit data arriving
         at the ingress port (logical or physical).
       o Carriage of the encapsulated data across a PSN tunnel.
       o Establishment of the PW including the exchange and/or
         distribution of the PW identifiers used by the PSN
         tunnel endpoints.
       o Managing the signaling, timing, order or other aspects of the
         service at the boundaries of the PW.
       o Service-specific status and alarm management.


1.3  Non-Goals of this document

   The following are non-goals for this document:

       o The on-the-wire specification of services encapsulation.
       o The detailed definition of the protocols involved in PW
         setup and maintenance.


   The following are outside the scope of PWE3:
      o Any multicast service not native to the emulated medium.
        Thus, Ethernet transmission to a "multicast" IEEE-48 address
        is in scope, while multicast services like MARS [RFC2022] that
        are implemented on top of the medium are out of scope.
      o Methods to signal or control the underlying PSN.

   1.4 Terminology

   Editor's note: Although it was decided at IETF-54 that the PWE3
   common terminology should be published in a separate document, there
   is case for it remaining in the architecture document. If the PWE3-WG
   confirms the desire to have a separate document, we will remove this
   section in the next revision.

   This document uses the following definitions of terms.  These terms
   are illustrated in context in Figure 2.

   Attachment Circuit   The circuit or virtual circuit attaching
   (AC)                 a CE to a PE.

   Applicability        Each PW service will have an Applicability
   Statement (AS)       Statement (AS) that describes the applicability
                        of PWs for that service.

   CE-bound             The traffic direction where PW-PDUs are
                        received on a PW via the PSN, processed
                        and then sent to the destination CE.

   CE Signaling         Messages sent and received by the CEs

                        even necessary for the PE to participate
                        in or monitor this signaling in order
                        to effectively emulate the service.

   Customer Edge (CE)   A device where one end of a service
                        originates and/or terminates.  The CE is not
                        aware that it is using an emulated service
                        rather than a native service.

   Fragmentation        The action of dividing a single PDU into
                        multiple PDUs before transmission with the
                        intent of the original PDU being reassembled
                        elsewhere in the network. Fragmentation may be
                        performed in order to allow sending of packets
                        of a larger size than the network MTU which
                        they will traverse.

   Maximum transmission The packet size (excluding data link header)
   unit (MTU)           that an interface can be transmit without
                        needing to fragment.

   Native Service       Processing of the data received by the PE

   PE-bound             The traffic direction where information
                        from a CE is adapted to a PW, and PW-PDUs
                        are sent into the PSN.

                        tear down the PW.  It may be coupled with
                        CE Signaling in order to effectively manage
                        the PW.

   PW End Service       The interface between a PE and a CE.  This
   (PWES)               can be a physical interface like a T1 or

                        or VLAN.

   Pseudo Wire          A mechanism that emulates the essential
   Emulation Edge to    attributes of service (such as a T1 leased

   Pseudo Wire PDU      A PDU sent on the PW that contains all of

2.  PWE3 Applicability

   The PSN carrying a PW will subject payload packets to delay, jitter,
   network transients and re-ordering.  The applicability of PWE3 to a
   particular service depends on the sensitivity of that service to
   these effects, and the ability of the adaptation layer to mask them.
   Some services, such as IP over FR over PWE3, may prove quite
   resilient to IP and MPLS PSN characteristics. Other services, such as
   the interconnection of PBX systems via PWE3, will require more
   careful consideration of the PSN and adaptation layer
   characteristics.  In some instances, traffic engineering of the
   underlying PSN will be required, and in some cases the constraints
   may be such that it is not possible to provide the required service
   guarantees.




3.  Protocol Layering Model

   The PWE3 protocol-layering model is intended to minimise the
   differences between PWs operating over different PSN types.  The
   design of the protocol-layering model has the goals of making each PW
   definition independent of the underlying PSN, and maximizing the
   reuse of IETF protocol definitions and their implementations.

3.1  Protocol Layers

   The logical protocol-layering model required to support a PW is shown
   in Figure 1.

   The payload is transported over the Encapsulation Layer.  The
   Encapsulation Layer carries any information, not already present
   within the payload itself, that is needed by the PW CE-bound PE
   interface to send the payload to the CE via the physical interface.
   If no information is needed beyond that in the payload itself, this
   layer is empty.

   This layer also provides support for real-time processing, and
   sequencing, if needed.

   The PW Demultiplexer Layer provides the ability to deliver multiple
   PWs over a single PSN tunnel. The PW demultiplexer value used to
   identify the PW in the data-plane may be unique per PE, but this is
   not a PWE3 requirement.  It must, however, be unique per tunnel
   endpoint.  If it is necessary to identify a particular tunnel, then
   that is the responsibility of the PSN layer.

   The PSN Convergence Layer provides the enhancements needed to make
   the PSN conform to the assumed PSN service requirement.  This layer
   therefore provides a consistent interface to the PW, making the PW
   independent of the PSN type.  If the PSN already meets the service
   requirements, this layer is empty.

   The PSN header, MAC/Data-link and Physical Layer definitions are
   outside the scope of this document. The PSN can be IPv4, IPv6 or
   MPLS.

3.2  Domain of PWE3

   PWE3 defines the Encapsulation Layer, the method of carrying various
   payload types, and the interface to the PW Demultiplexer Layer.  It
   is expected that the other layers will be provided by tunneling
   methods such as L2TP or MPLS over the PSN.

3.3  Payload Types

   The payload is classified into the following generic types of native
   data unit:

       o Packet
       o Cell
       o Bit-stream
       o Structured bit-stream

   Within these generic types there are specific service types.  For
   example:

       Generic Payload Type    PW Service

       --------------------    ----------
       Packet                  Ethernet (all types), HDLC,
                               frame-relay, ATM AAL5 PDU.

       Cell                    ATM.

       Bit-stream              SONET, TDM (e.g. DS1, DS3, E1).

       Structured bit-stream   SONET, TDM.


3.3.1.  Packet Payload

   A packet payload is a variable-size data unit presented to the PE on
   the AC.  A packet payload may be large compared to the PSN MTU. The
   delineation of the packet boundaries is encapsulation-specific.  HDLC
   or Ethernet PDUs can be considered as examples of packet payloads.
   Typically a packet will be stripped of transmission overhead such as
   HDLC flags and stuffing bits before transmission over the PW.

   A packet payload would normally be relayed across the PW as a single
   unit.  However, there will be cases where the combined size of the
   packet payload and its associated PWE3 and PSN headers exceeds the
   PSN path MTU.  In these cases, some fragmentation methodology needs
   to be applied.  This may, for example, be the case when a user is
   providing the service and attaching to the service provider via an
   Ethernet, or where nested pseudo-wires are involved. Fragmentation is
   discussed in more detail in Section 5.

   A packet payload may need sequencing and real-time support.

   In some situations, the packet payload may be selected from the
   packets presented on the emulated wire on the basis of some sub-
   multiplexing technique.  For example, one or more frame-relay PDUs
   may be selected for transport over a particular pseudo-wire based on
   the frame-relay Data-Link Connection Identifier (DLCI), or, in the
   case of Ethernet payloads, on the basis of the VLAN identifier.  This
   is an FWRD function, and this selection would therefore be made
   before the packet was presented to the PW Encapsulation Layer.

3.3.2.  Cell Payload

   A cell payload is created by capturing, transporting and replaying
   groups of bits presented on the wire in a fixed-size format.  The
   delineation of the group of bits that comprise the cell is specific
   to the encapsulation type.  Two common examples of cell payloads are
   53-octet cells carrying ATM AAL2, and the larger 188-octet MPEG
   Transport Stream packets [ETSI].



Bryant and Pate.             Informational                     [Page 11]

INTERNET DRAFT        draft-ietf-pwe3-arch-00.txt             April 2002


   To reduce per-PSN packet overhead, multiple cells may be concatenated
   into a single payload.  The Encapsulation Layer may consider the
   payload complete on the expiry of a timer, or after a fixed number of
   cells have been received.  The benefit of concatenating multiple PDUs
   should be weighed against the resulting increase in jitter and the
   larger penalty incurred by packet loss.  In some cases, it may be
   appropriate for the Encapsulation Layer to perform a silence
   suppression or a similar compression.

   The generic cell payload service will normally need sequence number
   support, and may also need real-time support.  The generic cell
   payload service would not normally require fragmentation.

   The Encapsulation Layer may apply some form of compression to some of
   these sub-types.

   In some instances, the cells to be incorporated in the payload may be
   selected by filtering them from the stream of cells presented on the
   wire.  For example, an ATM PWE3 service may select cells based on
   their VCI or VPI fields. This is an NSP function, and the selection
   would therefore be made before the packet was presented to the PW
   Encapsulation Layer.

3.3.3.  Bit-stream

   A bit-stream payload is created by capturing, transporting and
   replaying the bit pattern on the emulated wire, without taking
   advantage of any structure that, on inspection, may be visible within
   the relayed traffic (i.e. the internal structure has no effect on the
   fragmentation into packets).  The Encapsulation Layer submits an
   identical number of bits for transport in each PW-PDU.

   This service will require sequencing and real-time support.

3.3.4.  Structured bit-stream

   A bit-stream payload is created by using some knowledge of the
   underlying structure of the bit-stream to capture, transport and
   replay the bit pattern on the emulated wire (i.e. the internal
   structure directly effects the fragmentation into packets).

   Two important points distinguish structured and unstructured bit-
   streams:

       o Some part of the original (unstructured) bit-stream are
         stripped by, for example, the PSN-bound direction of the
         NSP block.  For example, in Structured SONET the section
         and line overhead (and, possibly, more) may be stripped.

INTERNET DRAFT        draft-ietf-pwe3-arch-00.txt             April 2002


       o The PW must preserve the structure across the PSN so that
         the CE-bound NSP block can insert it correctly into the
         reconstructed unstructured bit-stream.

   The Encapsulation Layer may also perform silence/idle suppression or
   similar compression on a structured bit-stream.

   Structured bit-streams are distinguished from cells in that the
   structures may be too long to be carried in a single packet (i.e.
   structured SONET).  Note that "short" structures are
   indistinguishable from cells and may benefit from the use of cell
   encapsulations.

   This service will require sequencing and real-time support.

3.3.5.  Principle of Minimum Intervention

   To minimise the scope of information, and to improve the efficiency
   of data flow through the Encapsulation Layer, the payload should be
   transported as received with as few modifications as possible
   [RFC1958].

   This minimum intervention approach decouples payload development from
   PW development and requires fewer translations at the NSP in a system
   with similar CE interfaces at each end.  It also prevents any
   unwanted side-effects due to subtle mis-representation of the payload
   in the intermediate format.

   An intervention approach can be more wire-efficient in some cases and
   may result in fewer translations at the NSP where the CE interfaces
   are of different types. Any intermediate format effectively becomes a
   new framing type, requiring documentation and assured
   interoperability.  This increases the amount of work for handling the
   protocol the intermediate format carries, and is undesirable.

         native service                               native service

                   Figure 2: PWE3 Network Reference Model

   The two PEs (PE1 and PE2) need to provide one or more PWs on behalf
   of their client CEs (CE1 and CE2) to enable the client CEs to
   communicate over the PSN.  A PSN tunnel is established to provide a
   data path for the PW.  The PW traffic is invisible to the core
   network, and the core network is transparent to the CEs.  Native data
   units (bits, cells or packets) presented at the PW End Service (PWES)
   are encapsulated in a PW-PDU and carried across the underlying
   network via the PSN tunnel. The PEs perform the necesssary
   encapsulation and decapsulation of PW-PDUs, as well as handling any
   other functions required by the PW service, such as sequencing or
   timing.

   There are situations in which a particular packet payload needs to be
   multicast so that it is received by a number of CEs.  This is useful
   when using PWs as part of a "virtual LAN" service (see, e.g.,



Bryant and Pate.             Informational                     [Page 14]

INTERNET DRAFT        draft-ietf-pwe3-arch-00.txt             April 2002


   [VPLS]). This can be achieved by replicating the payload and
   transmitting the replicas on PWs, but it may also be useful to have a
   type of PW which is inherently point-to-multipoint.  In that case,
   the PW would need to be carried through a point-to-multipoint PSN
   tunnel, employing a multicast mechanism provided by the PSN.

4.2  PWE3 Pre-processing

   In some applications, there is a need to perform operations on the
   native data units received from the CE (including both payload and
   signaling traffic) before they are transmitted across the PW by the
   PE. Examples include Ethernet bridging, SONET cross-connect,
   translation of locally-significant identifiers such as VCI/VPI, or
   translation to another service type.  These operations could be
   carried out in external equipment, and the processed data sent to the
   PE over one or more physical interfaces.  In most cases, there are
   cost and operational benefits in undertaking these operations within
   the PE.  This processed data is then presented to the PW via a
   virtual interface within the PE.

   These pre-processing operations are included in the PWE3 reference
   model to provide a common reference point, but the detailed
   description of these operations is outside the scope of the PW
   definition given here.

      Figure 3: Pre-processing within the PWE3 Network Reference Model

   Figure 3 shows the inter-working of one PE with pre-processing
   (PREP), and a second without this functionality.  This is a useful
   reference point because it emphasises that the functional interface
   between PREP and the PW is that represented by a physical interface
   carrying the service.  This effectively defines the necessary inter-
   working specification.

   The operation of a system in which both PEs include PREP
   functionality is also supported.

   The required pre-processing can be divided into two components:
       o Forwarder (FWRD)

       o Native Service Processing (NSP)

4.2.1. Forwarders

   In some applications there is the need to selectively forward payload
   elements from one of more ACs to one or more PWs. In such cases there



Bryant and Pate.             Informational                     [Page 16]

INTERNET DRAFT        draft-ietf-pwe3-arch-00.txt             April 2002


   will also be the need to perform the inverse function on PWE3-PDUs
   received by a PE from the PSN. This is the function of the FWRD.

   The FWRD selects the PW based on, for example: the incoming AC, the
   contents of the payload, or some statically- or dynamically-
   configured forwarding information.

                Figure 4b: Multiple PWEs to Multiple PW Forwarding

   Figure 4a shows a simple FWRD that performs some type of filtering
   operation. Because the FWRD has a single input and a single output
   interface, filtering is the only type of forwarding operation that
   applies. Figure 4b shows a more general forwarding situation where
   payloads are extracted from one or more PWESs and directed to one or
   more PWs, including, in this instance, a multipoint PW. In this case

INTERNET DRAFT        draft-ietf-pwe3-arch-00.txt             April 2002


   both filtering and direction operations may be performed on the
   payloads.

4.2.2. Native Service Processing

   In some applications some form of data or address translation, or
   other operation requiring knowledge of the semantics of the payload,
   will be required. This is the function of the Native Service
   Processor (NSP).

   The use of the NSP approach simplifies the design of the PW by
   restricting a PW to homogeneous operation.  NSP is included in the
   reference model to provide a defined interface to this functionality.
   The specification of the various types of NSP is outside the scope of
   PWE3.

   PE.  The NSP function may apply any transformation operation
   (modification, injection, etc.) on the payloads as they pass between
   the physical interface to the CE and the virtual interface to the
   FWRD.  A PE device may contain more than one FWRD.

   This model also supports the operation of a system in which the NSP
   functionality includes terminating the data-link and applying Network
   Layer processing to the payload is also supported.

            Figure 6: PWE3 Maintenance Reference Model

   The following signaling mechanisms are required:

       o The CE (end-to-end) signaling is between the CEs.  This
         signaling could be frame relay PVC status signaling, ATM SVC
         signaling, etc.

       o The PW/PE Maintenance is used between the PEs (or NSPs) to set
         up, maintain and tear down PWs, including any required
         coordination of parameters.

       o The PSN Tunnel signaling controls the PW multiplexing and some
         elements of the underlying PSN.  Examples are L2TP control
         protocol, MPLS LDP and RSVP-TE.  The definition of the
         information that PWE3 needs to be signaled is within the scope
         of PWE3, but the signaling protocol itself is not.

4.4  Protocol Stack Reference Model

   Figure 7 illustrates the protocol stack reference model for PWs.

   The PW provides the CE with an emulated physical or virtual
   connection to its peer at the far end.  Native service PDUs from the
   CE are passed through an Encapsulation Layer at the sending PE, and
   then sent over the PSN. The receiving PE removes the encapsulation
   and restores the payload to its native format for transmission to the
   destination CE.

4.5  Pre-processing Extension to Protocol Stack Reference Model

   Figure 8 illustrates how the protocol stack reference model is
   extended to include the provision of pre-processing (Forwarding and
   NSP).  This shows the ideal placement of the physical interface
   relative to the CE.

5.  PW Encapsulation

   The PW Encapsulation Layer provides the necessary infrastructure to
   adapt the specific payload type being transported over the PW to the
   PW Demultiplexer Layer that is used to carry the PW over the PSN.

   The PW Encapsulation Layer consists of three sub-layers:

       o Payload Convergence
       o Timing
       o Sequencing

   The PW Encapsulation sub-layering and its context with the protocol

     Figure 9: PWE3 Encapsulation Layer in Context

   The Payload Convergence Sub-layer is highly tailored to the specific
   payload type, but, by grouping a number of target payload types into
   a generic class, and then providing a single convergence sub-layer
   type common to the group, we achieve a reduction in the number of
   payload convergence sub-layer types.  This decreases implementation
   complexity. The provision of per-packet signaling and other out-of-
   band information (other than sequencing or timing) is undertaken by
   this layer.

   The Timing Layer and the Sequencing Layer provide generic services to
   the Payload Convergence Layer for all payload types, when required.

5.1  Payload Convergence Layer

5.1.1.  Encapsulation

   The primary task of the Payload Convergence Layer is the
   encapsulation of the payload in PW-PDUs.  The native data units to be
   encapsulated may or may not contain L2 or L1 header information.
   This is service specific.  The Payload Convergence header carries the
   additional information needed to replay the native data units at the
   CE-bound physical interface. The PW Demultiplexer header is not
   considered as part of the PW header.



Bryant and Pate.             Informational                     [Page 22]

INTERNET DRAFT        draft-ietf-pwe3-arch-00.txt             April 2002


   Not all the additional information needed to replay the native data
   units need to be carried in the PW header of the PW PDUs.  Some
   information (e.g. service type of a PW) may be stored as state
   information at the destination PE during PW set-up.

5.1.2.  PWE3 Channel Types

   The PW Encapsulation Layer and its associated signaling require one
   or more of the following types of channels from its underlying PW
   Demultiplexer and PSN Layers:

   1. A reliable control channel for signaling line events, status
      indications, and, in some exceptional cases, CE-CE events
      that must be translated and sent reliably between PEs.

      For example, this capability is needed in [PPPoL2TP]
      (PPP negotiation has to be split between the two ends of the
      tunnel).  PWE3 may also need this type of control channel to
      provide faithful emulation of complex data-link protocols.

   plus one or more data channels with the following characteristics:

   2. A high-priority, unreliable, sequenced channel.  A typical use
      is for CE-to-CE signaling.  "High priority" may simply be
      indicated via DSCP/EXP bits for priority during transit.
      This channel type could also use a bit in the tunnel header
      itself to indicate that packets received at the PE should be
      processed with higher priority [RFC2474].

   3. A sequenced channel for data traffic that is sensitive to
      packet reordering (one classification for use could be for
      any non-IP traffic).

   4. An un-sequenced channel for data traffic insensitive to packet
      order.

   The data channels (2, 3 and 4 above) should be carried "in band" with
   one another to as much of a degree as is reasonably possible on a
   PSN.

   Where end-to-end connectivity may be disrupted by address translation
   [RFC3022], access-control lists, firewalls etc., there exists the
   possibility that the control channel may be able to pass traffic and
   set up the PW, but the PW data-path data traffic is blocked by one or
   more of these mechanisms.  In these cases unless the control channel
   is also  carried "in  band" the  signaling to set-up the PW will not
   confirm the existence of an end-to-end data path.




Bryant and Pate.             Informational                     [Page 23]

INTERNET DRAFT        draft-ietf-pwe3-arch-00.txt             April 2002


   In some cases there is a need to synchronize some CE events with the
   data carried over a PW.  This is especially the case with TDM
   circuits (e.g., on-hook/off-hook events in PSTN switches).

   PWE3 channel types that are not needed by the supported PWs need not
   be included in such an implementation.

5.1.3.  Quality of Service Considerations

   Where possible, it is desirable to employ mechanisms to provide PW
   Quality of Service (QoS) support over PSNs.

5.2  Payload-independent PW Encapsulation Layers

   Two PWE3 Encapsulation Sub-layers provide common services to all
   payload types: Sequencing and Timing.  These services are optional
   and are only used if needed by a particular PW instance.  If the
   service is not needed, the associated header may be omitted in order
   to conserve processing and network resources.

   There will be instances where a specific payload type will be
   required to be transported with or without sequence and/or real-time
   support.  For example, an invariant of frame relay transport is the
   preservation of packet order. Some frame-relay applications expect
   in-order delivery, and may not cope with reordering of the frames.
   However, where the frame relay service is itself only being used to
   carry IP, it may be desirable to relax that constraint in return for
   reduced per-packet processing cost.

   The guiding principle is that, where possible, an existing IETF
   protocol should be used to provide these services.  Where a suitable
   protocol is not available, the existing protocol should be extended
   or modified to meet the PWE3 requirements, thereby making that
   protocol available for other IETF uses. In the particular case of
   timing, more than one general method may be necessary to provide for
   the full scope of payload timing requirements.

5.2.1.  Sequencing

   The sequencing function provides three services: frame ordering,
   frame duplication detection and frame loss detection. These services
   allow the invariant properties of a physical wire to be emulated.
   Support for sequencing depends on the payload type, and may be
   omitted if not needed.

   The size of the sequence-number space depends on the speed of the
   emulated service, and the maximum time of the transient conditions in
   the PSN.  A sequence number space greater than approximately 2^16 may



Bryant and Pate.             Informational                     [Page 24]

INTERNET DRAFT        draft-ietf-pwe3-arch-00.txt             April 2002


   therefore be needed to prevent the sequence number space wrapping
   during the transient.

5.2.1.1  Frame Ordering

   When packets carrying the PW-PDUs traverse a PSN, they may arrive out
   of order at the destination PE.  For some services, the frames
   (control frames, data frames, or both control and data frames) must
   be delivered in order.  For such services, some mechanism must be
   provided for ensuring in-order delivery. Providing a sequence number
   in the sequence sub-layer header for each packet is one possible
   approach to out-of-sequence detection.  Alternatively it can be noted
   that sequencing is a subset of the problem of delivering timed
   packets, and that a single combined mechanism such as [RFC1889] may
   be employed.

   There are two possible misordering strategies:

       o Drop misordered PW PDUs.

       o Try to sort PW PDUs into the correct order.

   The choice of strategy will depend on:

       o How critical the loss of packets is to the operation of
         the PW (e.g. the acceptable bit error rate).

       o The speeds of the PW and PSN.

       o The acceptable delay (since delay must be introduced to
         reorder)

       o The incidence of expected misordering.

5.2.1.2  Frame Duplication Detection

   In rare cases, packets traversing a PW may be duplicated by the
   underlying PSN.  For some services, frame duplication is not
   acceptable.  For such services, some mechanism must be provided to
   ensure that duplicated frames will not be delivered to the
   destination CE. The mechanism may or may not be the same as the
   mechanism used to ensure in-order frame delivery.

5.2.1.3  Frame Loss Detection

   A destination PE can determine whether a frame has been lost by
   tracking the sequence numbers of the received PW PDUs.




Bryant and Pate.             Informational                     [Page 25]

INTERNET DRAFT        draft-ietf-pwe3-arch-00.txt             April 2002


   In some instances, a destination PE will have to presume that a PW
   PDU is lost if it fails to arrive within a certain time.  If a PW-PDU
   that has been processed as lost subsequently arrives, the destination
   PE must discard it.

5.2.2.  Timing

   A number of native services have timing expectations based on the
   characteristics of the networks that they were designed to travel
   over, and it can be necessary for the emulated service to duplicate
   these network characteristics as closely as possible, e.g. in
   delivering native traffic with the same jitter, bit-rate and timing
   characteristics as it was sent.

   In such cases, it is necessary for the receiving PE to play out the
   native traffic as it was received at the sending PE.  This relies on
   either timing information sent between the two PEs, or in some case
   timing information received from an external reference.

   The Timing Sub-layer must therefore support two timing functions:
   clock recovery and timed payload delivery.  A particular payload type
   may require either or both of these services.

5.2.2.1  Clock Recovery

   Clock recovery is the extraction of output transmission bit timing
   information from the delivered packet stream, and requires a phase-
   locking mechanism.  A physical wire provides this naturally, but it
   is a relatively complex task to extract this from a highly jittered
   source such as packet stream.  It is therefore desirable that an
   existing real-time protocol such as [RFC1889] be used for this
   purpose, unless it can be shown that this is unsuitable or
   unnecessary for a particular payload type.

5.2.2.2  Timed delivery

   Timed delivery is the delivery of non-contiguous PW PDUs to the PW
   output interface with a constant phase relative to the input
   interface.  The timing of the delivery may be relative to a clock
   derived from the packet stream via clock recovery, or via an external
   clock.

5.3  Fragmentation

   A payload would normally be relayed across the PW as a single unit.
   However, there will be cases where the combined size of the payload
   and its associated PWE3 and PSN headers exceeds the PSN path MTU.
   When a packet exceeds the MTU of a given network, fragmentation and



Bryant and Pate.             Informational                     [Page 26]

INTERNET DRAFT        draft-ietf-pwe3-arch-00.txt             April 2002


   reassembly may have to be performed in order for the packet to be
   delivered.  Since fragmentation and reassembly generally consume a
   large amount of network resource as compared to simply switching a
   packet in its entirety, efforts should be made to reduce or eliminate
   the need for fragmentation and reassembly as much as possible
   throughout a network. Of particular concern for fragmentation and
   reassembly are aggregation points where large numbers of pseudowires
   are processed (e.g. at the PE).

   Ideally, the equipment originating the traffic being sent over the PW
   will be configured to have adaptive measures (e.g. [RFC1191],
   [RFC1981]) in place such that it never sends a packet which must be
   fragmented.  When this fails, the point closest to the sending host
   with fragmentation and reassembly capabilities should attempt to
   reduce the size of packets further into the network.  Thus, in the
   reference model for PWE3 [Figure 3] fragmentation should first be
   performed at the CE if at all possible.  If and only if the CE cannot
   adhere to an acceptable MTU size for the PW should the PE attempt its
   own fragmentation method.

   In cases where MTU management fails to limit the payload to a size
   suitable for transmission of the PW, the PE may fall back to either a
   generic PW fragmentation method, or, if available the fragmentation
   service of the underlying PSN.

   It is acceptable for a PE implementation to not support
   fragmentation.  A PE that does not support fragmentation will drop
   packets that exceed the PSN MTU, and the management plane of the
   encapsulating PE may be notified.

   If the length of a L2/L1 frame, restored from a PW PDU, exceeds the
   MTU of the destination PWES, it must be dropped.  In this case, the
   management plane of the destination PE may be notified.

5.4  Instantiation of the Protocol Layers

   This document does not address the detailed mapping of the Protocol
   Layering model to existing or future IETF standards.  The
   instantiation of the logical Protocol Layering model is shown in
   Figure 9.

5.4.1. PWE3 over an IP PSN

   The protocol definition of PWE3 over an IP PSN should employ existing
   IETF protocols where possible.

   Figure 10: PWE3 over an IP PSN

   Figure 10 shows the protocol layering for PWE3 over an IP PSN. As a
   rule, the payload should be carried as received from the NSP, with
   the Payload Convergence Layer provided when needed.  (It is accepted
   that there may sometimes be good reason not to follow this rule, but
   the exceptional circumstances need to be documented in the
   Encapsulation Layer definition for that payload type).

   Where appropriate, timing is provided by RTP [RFC1889], which when
   used also provides a sequencing service.  PW Demultiplexing may be
   provided by a number of existing IETF tunnel protocols.  Some of
   these tunnel protocols provide an optional sequencing service.
   (Sequencing is provided either by RTP, or by the PW Demultiplexer
   Layer, but not both).  A PSN Convergence Layer is not needed, because
   all the tunnel protocols shown above are designed to operate directly
   over an IP PSN.

   As a special case, if the PW Demultiplexer is an MPLS label, the
   protocol architecture of section 5.4.2 can be used instead of the
   protocol architecture of this section.

5.4.2. PWE3 over an MPLS PSN

   The MPLS ethos places importance on wire efficiency.  By using a
   control word, some components of the PWE3 protocol layers can be
   compressed to increase this efficiency.

   Figure 11: PWE3 over an MPLS PSN using a control word

   Figure 11 shows the protocol layering for PWE3 over an MPLS PSN.  An
   inner MPLS label is used to provide the PW demultiplexing function.
   A control word is used to carry most of the information needed by the
   PWE3 Encapsulation Layer and the PSN Convergence Layer in a compact
   format.  The flags in the control word provide the necessary payload
   convergence.  A sequence field provides support for both in-order
   payload delivery and (supported by a fragmentation control method) a
   PSN fragmentation service within the PSN Convergence Layer.  Ethernet
   pads all frames to a minimum size of 64 bytes. The MPLS header does
   not include a length indicator. Therefore to allow PWE3 to be carried
   in MPLS to correctly pass over an Ethernet data-link, a length
   correction field is needed in the control word.

   In some networks it may be necessary to carry PWE3 over MPLS over IP.
   In these circumstances, the PW is encapsulated for carriage over MPLS
   as described in this section, and then a standard method of carrying
   MPLS over an IP PSN (such as GRE [RFC2784], [RFC2890]) is applied to
   the resultant PW-PDU.

6.  PW Demultiplexer Layer and PSN Requirements

   PWE3 places three service requirements on the protocol layers used to
   carry it across the PSN:

       o Multiplexing
       o Fragmentation
       o Length and Delivery

6.1  Multiplexing

   The purpose of the PW Demultiplexer Layer is to allow multiple PWs to
   be carried in a single tunnel.  This minimizes complexity and
   conserves resources.

   Some types of native service are capable of grouping multiple
   circuits into a "trunk", e.g. multiple ATM VCs in a VP, multiple
   Ethernet VLANs on a physical media, or multiple DS0 services within a
   T1 or E1.  A PW may interconnect two end-trunks.  That trunk would
   have a single multiplexing value.

6.2  Fragmentation

   If the PSN provides a fragmentation and reassembly service of
   adequate performance, it MAY be used to obtain an effective MTU that
   is large enough to transport the PW PDUs. However, if the PSN does
   not offer an adequate service, and fragmentation at the PE cannot be
   avoided by any other means, then a PW-specific fragmentation method
   may be utilized here. See Section 5.3 for more details.

6.3  Length and Delivery

   PDU delivery to the egress PE is the function of the PSN Layer.

   If the underlying PSN does not provide all the information necessary
   to determine the length of a PW-PDU, the Encapsulation Layer will
   provide it.

6.4  PW-PDU Validation

   It is a common practice to use a CRC or similar mechanism to assure
   end-to-end integrity of frames.  The PW service-specific mechanisms
   MUST define whether the packet's checksum shall be preserved across
   the PW or be removed from PE bound PDUs and then be re-calculated for
   insertion in CE bound data.

   The former approach saves work, while the latter saves bandwidth. For
   a given implementation the choice may be dictated by hardware



Bryant and Pate.             Informational                     [Page 30]

INTERNET DRAFT        draft-ietf-pwe3-arch-00.txt             April 2002


   restrictions.

   For protocols such as ATM and FR, the scope of the checksum is
   restriced to a single link.  This is because the circuit identifiers
   (e.g. FR DLCI or ATM VPI/VCI) have only local significance and are
   changed on each hop or span.  If the circuit identifier (and thus
   checksum) were going to change as a part of the PW emulation, it
   would be more efficient to strip and re-calculate the checksum.

   The service specific document for each protocol must describe the
   validation scheme to be used.

6.5  Congestion Considerations

   The PSN carrying the PW may be subject to congestion. The congestion
   characteristics will vary with the PSN type, the network architecture
   and configuration, and the loading of the PSN.

   Each service specific document will have to specify whether it needs
   an appropriate mechanism for operating in the presence of this
   congestion, including methods of mapping between its native
   congestion reporting and avoidance mechanisms, and those provided by
   the PW.







7.  Control Plane

   This section describes PWE3 control plane services.

7.1  Set-up or Teardown of Pseudo-Wires

   A PW must be set up before an emulated service can be established,
   and must be torn down when an emulated service is no longer needed.

   Set up or teardown of a PW can be triggered by a CLI command, from
   the management plane of a PE, by signaling (i.e., set-up or teardown)
   of a PWES, e.g., an ATM SVC, or by an auto-discovery mechanism.

   During the set-up process, the PEs need to exchange some information
   (e.g. learn each others' capabilities).  The tunnel signalling
   protocol may be extended to provide mechanisms to enable the PEs to
   exchange all necessary information on behalf of the PW.




Bryant and Pate.             Informational                     [Page 31]
U10
INTERNET DRAFT        draft-ietf-pwe3-arch-00.txt             April 2002


   Manual configuration of PWs can be considered a special kind of
   signaling, and is allowed.

7.2  Status Monitoring

   Some native services have mechanisms for status monitoring. For
   example, ATM supports OAM for this purpose.  For such services, the
   corresponding emulated services must specify how to perform status
   monitoring.

7.3  Notification of Pseudo-wire Status Changes

7.3.1.  Pseudo-wire Up/Down Notification

   If a native service requires bi-directional connectivity, the
   corresponding emulated service can only be signaled up when the
   associated PWs, and PSN tunnels if any, are functional in both
   directions.

   Because the two CEs of an emulated service are not adjacent, a
   failure may occur at a place such that one or both physical links
   between the CEs and PEs remain up.  For example, in Figure 2, if the
   physical link between CE1 and PE1 fails, the physical link between
   CE2 and PE2 will not be affected and will remain up.  Unless CE2 is
   notified about the remote failure, it will continue to send traffic
   over the emulated service to CE1.  Such traffic will be discarded at
   PE1.  Some native services have failure notification so that when the
   services fail, both CEs will be notified.  For such native services,
   the corresponding PWE3 service must provide a failure notification
   mechanism.

   Similarly, if a native service has notification mechanisms so that
   when a network failure is fixed, all the affected services will
   change status from "Down" to "Up", the corresponding emulated service
   must provide a similar mechanism for doing so.

   These mechanisms may already be built into the tunneling protocol.
   For example, the L2TP control protocol [RFC2661] [L2TPv3] has this
   capability and LDP has the ability to withdraw the corresponding MPLS
   label.

7.3.2.  Misconnection and Payload Type Mismatch

   With PWE3, misconnection and payload type mismatch can occur.  If a
   misconnection occurs it can breach the integrity of the system.  If a
   payload mismatch occurs it can disrupt the customer network.  In both
   instances, there are security and operational concerns.




Bryant and Pate.             Informational                     [Page 32]

INTERNET DRAFT        draft-ietf-pwe3-arch-00.txt             April 2002


   The services of the underlying tunneling mechanism, and its
   associated control protocol, can be used to mitigate this.  As part
   of the PW set-up a PW-TYPE identifier is exchanged. This is then used
   by the FWRD and NSP to verify the compatibility of the PWESs.

7.3.3.  Packet Loss, Corruption, and Out-of-order Delivery

   A PW can incur packet loss, corruption, and out-of-order delivery on
   the PSN path between the PEs.  This can impact the working condition
   of an emulated service. For some payload types, packet loss,
   corruption, and out-of-order delivery can be mapped to either a bit
   error burst, or loss of carrier on the PW.  If a native service has
   some mechanism to deal with bit error, the corresponding PWE3 service
   should provide a similar mechanism.

7.3.4.  Other Status Notification

   A PWE3 approach may provide a mechanism for other status
   notification, if any.

7.3.5.  Collective Status Notification

   Status of a group of emulated services may be affected identically by
   a single network incident.  For example, when the physical link (or
   sub-network) between a CE and a PE fails, all the emulated services
   that go through that link (or sub-network) will fail.  It is likely
   that there exists a group of emulated services that all terminate at
   a remote CE. There may also be multiple such CEs affected by the
   failure. Therefore, it is desirable that a single notification
   message be used to notify failure of the whole group of emulated
   services.

   A PWE3 approach may provide some mechanism for notifying status
   changes of a group of emulated circuits.  One possible method is to
   associate each emulated service with a group ID when the PW for that
   emulated service is set up.  Multiple emulated services can then be
   grouped by associating them with the same group ID. In status
   notification, that group ID can be used to refer all the emulated
   services in that group.  The group ID mechanism should be a mechanism
   provided by the underlying tunnel signaling protocol.

7.4  Keep-alive

   If a native service has a keep-alive mechanism, the corresponding
   emulated service needs to use a mechanism to propagate this across
   the PW.  An approach following the principle of minimum intervention
   would be to transparently transport keep-alive messages over the PW.
   However, to accurately reproduce the semantics of the native



Bryant and Pate.             Informational                     [Page 33]

INTERNET DRAFT        draft-ietf-pwe3-arch-00.txt             April 2002


   mechanism, some PWs may require an alternative approach, such as
   piggy-backing on the PW signaling mechanism.

7.5  Handling Control Messages of the Native Services

   Some native services use control messages for maintaining the
   circuits.  These control messages may be in-band, e.g. Ethernet flow
   control or ATM performance management, or out-of-band, e.g. the
   signaling VC of an ATM VP.

   From the principle of minimum intervention, it is desirable that the
   PEs participate as little as possible in the signaling and
   maintenance of the native services.  This principle should not,
   however, override the need to satisfactorily emulate the native
   service.

   If control messages are passed through, it may be desirable to send
   them using either a higher priority or a reliable channel provided by
   the PW Demultiplexer layer.  See PWE3 Channel Types.




8. Management and Monitoring

   This section describes the management and monitoring architecture for
   PWE3.

8.1  Statistics

   The PE can tabulate statistics that help monitor the state of the
   network, and to help with measurement of service level agreements
   (SLAs). Typical counters include:

       o Counts of PW-PDUs sent and received, with and without errors.
       o Counts of sequenced PW-PDUs lost.
       o Counts of service PDUs sent and received, with and without
         errors (non-TDM).
       o Service-specific interface counts.

   These counters would be contained in a PW-specific MIB, and they
   should not replicate existing MIB counters.

8.2  PW SNMP MIB Architecture

   This section describes the general architecture for SNMP MIBs used to
   manage PW services and the underlying PSN.  The intent here is to
   provide a clear picture of how all of the pertinent MIBs fit together
   to form a cohesive management framework for deploying PWE3 services.

8.2.1.  MIB Layering

               Figure 13: Service-specific Example for MIBs

   Note that there is a separate MIB for each emulated service as well
   as one for each underlying PSN.  These MIBs may be used in various
   combinations as needed.

8.2.2.  Service Layer MIBs

   The first layer is referred to as the Service Layer.  It contains
   MIBs for PWE3 services such as Ethernet, ATM, circuits and Frame
   Relay. This layer contains those corresponding MIBs used to mate or
   adapt those emulated services to the underlying services.  This
   working group should not produce any MIBs for managing the general
   service; rather, it should produce just those MIBs that are used to
   interface or adapt the emulated service onto the PWE3 management
   framework.  For example, the standard SONET MIB [SONETMIB] is
   designed and maintained by another working group. Also, the SONET MIB
   is designed to manage the native service without PW emulation.  Since
   the PWE3 working group is chartered to produce the corresponding
   adaptation MIB, in this case, it would produce the PW-CEM-MIB
   [PWMPLSMIB] that would be used to adapt SONET services to the
   underlying PSN that carries the PWE3 service.

INTERNET DRAFT        draft-ietf-pwe3-arch-00.txt             April 2002


8.2.3.  Generic PW MIBs

   The second layer is referred to as the Generic PW Layer.  This layer
   is composed of two MIBs: the PWE-TC-MIB [PWTCMIB] and the PWE-MIB
   [PWMIB]. These MIBs are responsible for providing general PWE3
   counters and service models used for monitoring and configuration of
   PWE3 services over any supported PSN service.  That is, this MIB
   provides a general model of PWE3 abstraction for management purposes.
   This MIB is used to interconnect the Service Layer MIBs to the PSN VC
   Layer MIBs. The latter will be described in the next section.  This
   layer also provides the PW-TC-MIB [PWTCMIB].  This MIB contains
   common SMI textual conventions [RFC1902] that may be used by any PW
   MIB.

8.2.4.  PSN VC Layer MIBs

   The third layer in the PWE3 management architecture is referred to as
   the PSN VC layer.  This layer is comprised of MIBs that are
   specifically designed to interface general PWE3 services (VCs) onto
   those underlying PSN services.  In general this means that the MIB
   provides a means with which an operator can map the PW service onto
   the native PSN service. For example, in the case of MPLS, it is
   required that the general VC service be layered onto MPLS LSPs or
   Traffic Engineered (TE) Tunnels [RFC3031].  In this case, the PW-
   MPLS-MIB [PWMPLSMIB] was created to adapt the general PWE3 circuit
   services onto MPLS.  Like the Service Layer described above the PWE3
   working group should produce these MIBs.

8.2.5.  PSN Layer MIBs

   The fourth and final layer in the PWE3 management architecture is
   referred to as the PSN layer.  This layer is comprised of those MIBs
   that control the PSN service-specific services.  For example, in the
   case of the MPLS [RFC3031] PSN service, the MPLS-LSR-MIB [LSRMIB] and
   the MPLS-TE-MIB [TEMIB] are used to interface the general PWE3 VC
   services onto native MPLS LSPs and/or TE tunnels to carry the
   emulated services.  In addition, the MPLS-LDP-MIB [LDPMIB] may be
   used to reveal the MPLS labels that are distributed over the MPLS PSN
   in order to maintain the PW service. The MIBs in this layer are
   produced by other working groups that design and specify the native
   PSN services.  These MIBs should contain the appropriate mechanisms
   for monitoring and configuring the PSN service such that the emulated
   PWE3 service will function correctly.

8.3 Connection Verification and Traceroute

   A connection verification mechanism should be supported by PWs.
   Connection verification as well as other alarming mechanisms can
   alert the operator that a PW has lost its remote connection.  The
   opaque nature of a PW means that it is not possible to specify a
   generic connection verification or traceroute mechanism that passes
   this status to the CEs over the PW.  If connection verification
   status of the PW is needed by the CE, it must be mapped to the native
   connection status method.

   For troubleshooting purposes, it is sometimes desirable to know the
   exact functional path of a PW between PEs, thus a traceroute function
   capable of reporting the path taken by data packets over the PW
   should be provided. The opaque nature of the PW means that this
   traceroute information is only available within the provider network
   e.g. at the PEs.




9.  IANA considerations

   There are no IANA considerations for this document.




10.  Security Considerations

   PWE3 provides no means of protecting the contents or delivery of the
   native data units.  PWE3 may, however, leverage security mechanisms
   provided by the PW Demultiplexer or PSN Layers, such as IPSec
   [RFC2401].  This section addresses the PWE3 vulnerabilities, and the
   mechanisms available to protect the emulated native services.

   The PW Tunnel End-Point, PW Demultiplexing mechanism, and the
   payloads of the native service are all vulnerable to attack.

10.1  PW Tunnel End-Point and PW Demultiplexer Security

   Protection mechanisms must be considered for the PW Tunnel end-point
   and PW Demultiplexer mechanism in order to avoid denial-of-service
   attacks upon the native service, and to prevent spoofing of the
   native data units.  Exploitation of vulnerabilities from within the
   PSN may be directed to the PW Tunnel end-point so that PW
   Demultiplexer and PSN tunnel services are disrupted.  Controlling PSN
   access to the PW Tunnel end-point may protect against this.



Bryant and Pate.             Informational                     [Page 38]

INTERNET DRAFT        draft-ietf-pwe3-arch-00.txt             April 2002


   By restricting PW Tunnel end-point access to legitimate remote PE
   sources of traffic, the PE may reject traffic that would interfere
   with the PW Demultiplexing and PSN tunnel services.

10.2  Validation of PW Encapsulation

   Protection mechanisms must address the spoofing of tunneled PW data.
   The validation of traffic addressed to the PW Demultiplexer end-point
   is paramount in ensuring integrity of PW encapsulation.  Security
   protocols such as IPSec [RFC2401] may be used by the PW Demultiplexer
   Layer in order to maintain the integrity of the PW by authenticating
   data between the PW Demultiplexer End-points.  IPSec may provide
   authentication, integrity, non-repudiation, and confidentiality of
   data transferred between two PEs.  It cannot provide the equivalent
   services to the native service.

   Based on the type of data being transferred, the PW may indicate to
   the PW Demultiplexer Layer that enhanced security services are
   required.  The PW Demultiplexer Layer may define multiple protection
   profiles based on the requirements of the PW emulated service.  CE-
   to-CE signaling and control events emulated by the PW and some data
   types may require additional protection mechanisms.  Alternatively,
   the PW Demultiplexer Layer may use peer authentication for every PSN
   packet to prevent spoofed native data units from being sent to the
   destination CE.
