Abstract

   This document defines a mechanism which allows more-specific IP
   address prefixes to be aggregated when they are topologically
   equivalent or less preferable than a less-specific advertisement.

   It is designed to allow multi-homed sites to use "Provider
   Aggregatable" (PA) addresses and obtain both redundancy and local
   traffic optimizations when using multiple service providers.

Internet-Draft         Topology-based aggregation          December 2010


1.  Introduction

   With the existing inter-domain routing functionality as defined by
   RFC 4271 [RFC4271], multi-homed sites feel compelled to advertise
   their individual prefixes to the entire Internet in order to achieve
   the desired reliability and traffic-engineering behavior.

   Multi-homed sites typically advertise "Provider Independent" (PI)
   prefixes.  An alternative approach would be for "Provider
   Aggregatable" (PA) space to be used along with a set of procedures
   that allow for route advertisements to be aggregated.  This option
   must retain the functionality that is provided today by PI
   advertisements.

   One assumption made here is that renumbering of a multi-homed site is
   economically feasible given the increased usage of dynamic host
   configuration protocols and/or network address translation.

   This document is being written at a time when IP addresses are
   becoming scarse.  It is difficult to predict whether Internet address
   allocation and assignment policies will drift torwards the use of PI
   space in order to achieve more efficient allocation.  Or whether
   scarcity will make it harder to obtain PI space.

   In the latter case, this document define an approach that would allow
   multi-homed sites a method for using PA addresses without bumping
   into address space filtering rules that may be in place to limit the
   growth of the internet table size.

   In order to meet the requirements stated above for multi-home site
   routing, the following is proposed:

      The routing advertisement must be taken out of "Provider
      Aggregatable" (PA) space.

      The routing advertisement must be leaked through one or more
      alternate providers, other than the one owning the PA space.

      These more-specific route advertisements shall be automatically
      aggregated, depending on the network topology.

      If the multi-homed site becomes disconnected from the owner of the
      address space it must be possible to unsuppress the most-specific
      adververtisement.

   In order to provide topology-dependent aggregation, this document
   defines a new BGP path attribute, AGGREGATE_INFO, which defines a BGP
   prefix as being a more specific of a given aggregate prefix.  A BGP



Marques & White           Expires June 24, 2011                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         Topology-based aggregation          December 2010


   speaker that receives such a prefix MUST compare the received prefix
   with the specified aggregate, if present in its Loc-RIB.  The
   standard path selection algorithm is applied between the paths of the
   more-specific prefix and the best-path of the aggregate.  If the
   best-path of the aggregate is preferable, the more-specific prefix
   should be considered as "Inactive".  It SHOULD NOT be further re-
   advertised into External BGP sessions.  It MAY BE re-advertised into
   Internal BGP sessions, if the path-selection criteria between the
   aggregate and more-specific justifies it.

   Conceptually, the aggregate prefix conveys implicit path information
   that applies to the delegated more-specifics.  Path selection occurs
   between the explicit paths that are present in the routing system and
   these implicit paths represented by the aggregates.

   The AGGREGATE_INFO attribute contains an operational status field.
   This field is used to indicate the status of the connectivity between
   the multi-homed site and the provider owning the aggregate.  It can
   be used in a situation of failure in which the customer becomes
   detached from the service provider originating the PA aggregate.

   When the operational status denotes connectivity failure this will
   result on the more-specific being unsuppressed and attracting traffic
   through the failover paths.  The operational status is used
   explicitly in order to inform downstreams that the more-specific is
   temporary and will be removed from the routing system once
   connectivity is restored.

   The operational status field uses three colors: green, yellow and
   red.  Green means full connectivity.  Red means no connectivity.
   Yellow informs the routing system that while the site itself has no
   direct connectivity to the primary provider, it believes that there
   is sufficient redundant connectivity in the network that its prefix
   is still reachable through it.


2.  Topology-based aggregation

   The intent of this extension is to achieve the same semantics as
   "Provider Independent" (PI) advertisements, while removing the more
   specifics from the BGP routing table in locations of the network
   where the aggregate provides equal or better service to the IP
   destination prefix in question.

                                 Figure 1

   Figure 1 contains an example of the usage of the BGP AGGREGATE_INFO
   attribute.  AS 10 in the example above has been delegated "10.0.1/24"
   prefix by AS 1.  Using this extension, it will advertise the prefix
   into AS 2, which will likely prefer a customer router over a peer
   route to AS 1.  When AS 2 re-advertises the more-specific "10.0.1/24"
   to its peers, AS 3 and 4 in this example, the peers will compare the
   more-specific to the "10.0/16" aggregate received from AS 1.
   Typically AS 3 will prefer the aggregate (as-path: "1", length 1)
   over the more-specific (as-path: "2 10", length: 2).  When this is
   the case, the more-specific will be suppressed and no longer
   propagated in the network.  If, for any reason, AS 1 becomes
   disconnected from AS 3, the more-specific route to "10.0.1/24" will
   become active again, achieving the required failover protection.

   From a traffic-engineering perspective, the more-specific is selected
   in locations in the network where AS 10 is topologically closer than
   AS 1.

   In the example described above, the aggregate route may have a
   shorter as-path than the equivalent PI prefix that is in use
   currently.  A PI prefix that is injected by the customer AS (AS 10)
   would be advertised to AS 3 with an as-path of "1 10".  In order to

Internet-Draft         Topology-based aggregation          December 2010


   provide multi-homed sites with equivalent functionality as it is
   available to them using PI space, the AGGREGATE_INFO BGP attribute
   allows the originator to specify an AS_PATH attribute to be appended
   with the path contained in the aggregate route.  This allows the
   customer AS (AS 10) to indicate to AS 3 that the attribute comparison
   should be performed between the explicitly advertised more-specific
   with as-path "2 10" and an implicit more-specific path with an as-
   path of "1 10".  This implicit path is derived from the aggregate
   prefix.


3.  BGP AGGREGATE_INFO attribute

   The BGP AGGREGATE_INFO attribute is a well-known, transitive
   attribute with Type Code 129.  It contains a list of one or more
   aggregate target elements.  Each aggregate target contains a
   mandatory part, with the operational status field followed by a route
   prefix.  That may be followed by additional BGP PATH attributes that
   apply to the specified aggregate target prefix.

   The operational status is encoded as a 1-octect field with the
   following values:

    +-------+--------+-----------------------------------------------+
    | Value | Color  | Description                                   |
    +-------+--------+-----------------------------------------------+
    |   0   | Red    | No connectivity between customer and provider |
    |   1   | Yellow | Direct connectivity unavailable               |
    |   2   | Green  | Connectivity fully operational                |
    +-------+--------+-----------------------------------------------+

   The prefix is encoded as a 2 byte AFI [RFC1700] value, followed by a
   variable length prefix encoded as a 1 byte prefix-length in bits and
   the prefix itself padded to a byte boundary.  This is the same
   encoding used for NLRI in BGP UPDATE messages.

   The prefix contained in the AGGREGATE_INFO attribute SHOULD be a
   less-specific prefix containing all the NLRI specified in the BGP
   UPDATE message that includes this attribute.

   Following the route prefix, the encoding allows for one of more BGP
   path attributes using the encoding specified the BGP [RFC4271]
   protocol specification.  An implementation MAY choose to include an
   AS_PATH attribute in this optional element.

   When an AS_PATH attribute is contained inside an AGGREGATE_INFO
   attribute, the path segments that it contains shall be appended to
   the AS_PATH of the implicit path represented by the aggregate prefix.

Internet-Draft         Topology-based aggregation          December 2010


   This implicit path is then compared with the best path of NLRI
   prefix(es) included in the UPDATE message containing this attribute.

   Example encoding for prefix 10.0/16, as-path "10":

      Attr Flags = 0x40, Attr Code = 0x81, Attr Length = 0x0e

      OpStatus=0x2, AFI = 0x00 0x01, Prefix Length = 0x10, Prefix Data =
      0x0a 0x00

      Attr Flags = 0x40, Attr Code = 0x02, Attr Length = 0x04, Data =
      0x02 0x01 0x00 0x0a

   In the example given above, an AS_PATH segment of "10" in the
   aggregate-info attribute and an aggregate path with an AS_PATH of "1"
   would result in a as-path of "1 10", of length 2.

   When multiple aggregate target prefixes are present in a
   AGGREGATE_INFO attribute, the most significant prefix present in the
   Loc-Rib is used to generate the implicit path used in path selection.

   Multiple targets can be used when prefix assignment and delegation
   happens at more than one level.

   As an example, a provider X may have a /16 out of which it delegates
   to Y a specific /22 block.  Y then allocates a /24 to a specific
   multi-homed customer Z. If Y itself is using aggregation its prefix
   may be suppressed.  Where Z to originate a route with a single
   aggregation-target (/22), that prefix would not be aggregated in
   regions of the network where the /22 had itself be aggregated.

   For this mechanism to behave as expected one would have to ensure
   that if Y's prefix has been suppress then Z's has also been
   suppressed.  Otherwise if Z's prefix is present, its aggregation
   target of Y will be ignored.

   Since this condition cannot be guaranteed, the protocol allows the
   originator of the more-specific prefix (Z) to include multiple
   aggregation targets (Y and X) in its route advertisement.  Whenever Y
   is present in the Loc-Rib of BGP speaker, Y is used as source of the
   implicit aggregation path.  Otherwise X is used if present.

   The choice of explicitly listing the aggregation targets rather than
   automatically deriving the parent is designed to avoid situations in
   which the less-specific is being artificially generated such as, for
   instance, the default route.

4.  BGP extension deployment

   BGP speakers that support the extensions described in this document
   SHALL use the Capability Advertisement [RFC5492] BGP extension to
   advertise that support to its BGP peers.

   Compliant implementations should advertise the BGP Capability Code
   TBD.  The capability data should contain a 1-byte value which is
   interpreted as the version of this specification.  It should contain
   the value 1.

   When a BGP route is placed in the Out-RIB for a given external BGP
   peer and the peer in question doesn't support this capability, if the
   path in the Loc-Rib contains the AGGREGATE_INFO attribute this should
   result in the prefix being suppressed.  If a previous path was
   advertised to this peer that path shall be withdrawn.

   If the peer in question is an internal BGP peer which doesn't support
   this capability an implementation MAY choose to replace this
   attribute with the NO_EXPORT [RFC1997] BGP community attribute,
   rather than suppress the path.

   This mechanism assures that a path that originated with an
   AGGREGATE_INFO attribute is not used by a router without being
   compared to the respective aggregate.  This is intended to facilitate
   the incremental deployment of this functionality.


5.  Path selection criteria

   A BGP implementation shall run its path selection algorithm
   unmodified between all the paths for a given prefix.  If the selected
   best-path contains the BGP AGGREGATE_INFO attribute, this path shall
   be compared with the best-path of the aggregate prefix indicated by
   the attribute in question.

   The AGGREGATE_INFO attribute represents an implicit path for the
   more-specific prefix (the NLRI containing that attribute).  The BGP
   path attributes of this implicit prefix are the attributes of the
   best-path of the aggregate prefix.  If the AGGREGATE_INFO contains an
   optional AS_PATH attribute, the AS_PATH segments in that attribute
   shall be appended to the AS_PATH of the aggregate prefix best-path
   before comparison.

   When the Operational Status of the specified aggregate target is
   "Red" the corresponding implicit path is considered to be
   unreachable.  When the Operational Status is "Yellow" the originating
   AS of the aggregate target prefix MUST treat the implicit path as



Marques & White           Expires June 24, 2011                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         Topology-based aggregation          December 2010


   unreachable also and use the more-specific.  Autonomous-systems
   further downstream MAY choose whether to ignore or use the
   aggregation information.

   The "Yellow" state represents that the originator of the prefix
   believes that there is a path between the primary and backup
   providers for the site such that this path always prefers the more-
   specific advertisement.  This is often the case if both providers
   have a direct peering relationship.

   When comparing the more-specific path with its implicit path
   (represented by the aggregate), the following changes to the standard
   path selection algorithm should be taken into account:

   o  The Origin attributes of both paths are not comparable.  This is
      step b) in the path selection algorithm and should be bypassed.

   o  If the paths in question are equal upto step d) of path selection
      algorithm, if both paths are EBGP paths, the less-specific
      (aggregate) should be preferred.  This replaces the step in path
      selection where the oldest EBGP path is preferred [RFC5004].

   o  If both paths are iBGP paths, the less-specific (aggregate) should
      be preferred in case where the paths are equal up-to the router-id
      comparison step of path selection.

   When the aggregate path is considered to be preferable over the more-
   specific, the more-specific should be considered inactive and should
   not be installed in the FIB or subsequently advertised to other
   peers.


6.  Network deployment

   The objective of this document is to provide multi-homed sites with
   the resilience to failures and limited traffic-engineering
   capabilities without the need to recurse to PI advertisements.

   Instead of using a PI prefix, a multi-homed site can choose to
   address its network with PA prefix from one service provider which it
   then advertises through a secondary provider.  Or it may choose to
   dual address its hosts and/or NAT appliances.

   In order for a multi-homed site to achieve the required resilience it
   should be allowed by other service providers to inject the more-
   specifics that have been delegated to it with the BGP AGGREGATE_INFO
   attribute.

Internet-Draft         Topology-based aggregation          December 2010


   The AGGREGATE_INFO attribute should only be added to a BGP path by
   the originator of the route advertisement.  This rule is intended to
   ensure that there aren't instances of the same BGP path information
   flowing through the Internet routing system with and without the
   specified attribute.

   In order to maintain the loop free properties of BGP one must ensure
   that when suppressing a more-specific this doesn't result in traffic
   being forwarded in a way which results in a loop.

   For this to occur, the following conditions would be necessary:

      A transit AS (X) prefers the more-specific route.

      Another AS (Y) receives both aggregate and more-specific from X
      and prefers the former.

      Y is in the transit path for the more-specific.

   The last condition cannot occur since Y, by definition prefers the
   aggregate path and will not advertise the more-specific.


7.  Acknowledgements

   There have been several prior proposals to reduce routing information
   used in muli-homing scenarios.  For instance, using BGP communities
   [I-D.white-bounded-longest-match] and AS hops
   [I-D.ietf-idr-as-hopcount].

   The current document builds upon the previous work and proposes the
   use of standard BGP path selection using both implicit and explicit
   paths in order limit information to parts of the network where it is
   useful.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests IANA to allocate a BGP attribute type code value,
   for the BGP aggregate-info attribute defined herein.  It also
   requests IANA to allocate a Capability Code according to the

   procedures defined in RFC 5492 [RFC5492].


10.  Security Considerations

   The BGP aggregate-info attribute in itself doesn't create a new
   security threat.  This attribute can only lead to the route being
   suppressed.

   The presence of more-specifics in the routing system makes a stronger
   case for the usefulness of performing origin authentication of route
   advertisements.
