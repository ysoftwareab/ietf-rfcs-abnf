1. Introduction 

   The objective of this document is to define a reference peering 
   architecture in the context of Session PEERing for Multimedia 
   INTerconnect (SPEERMINT). In this process, we define a peering 
   reference architecture, its functional components, and peering 
   interface functions from the perspective of a real-time 
   communications (Voice and Multimedia) IP Service provider network.

   This reference architecture allows the interconnection of two service 
   providers in layer 5 peering as defined in the SPEERMINT Requirements 
   [2] and Terminology [1] documents for the purpose SIP-based voice and 
   multimedia traffic.  

   IP Layer peering is outside the scope of SPEERMINT at this time; 
   thus, we do not include them in the SPEEMINT Peering Architecture. 
   Note that IP Routers are not shown in the subsequent figures so that 
   the focus is on Layer 5 protocol aspects.  

   This document uses terminology defined in the SPEERMINT Terminology 
   document [1].                        

2. Network Context 

   Figure 1 shows an example network context. Two SIP providers can form 
   a Layer 5 peer over either the public Internet or private Layer 3 
   networks. In addition, two or more providers may form a SIP (Layer 5) 
   federation [1][9] on either the public Internet or private Layer 3 
   networks. This document does not make any assumption whether the SIP 
   providers directly peer to each other or through Layer 3 transit 
   network as per use case of [7].  

   Note that Figure 1 allows for the following potential SPEERMINT 
   peering scenarios: 

   o  Enterprise to Enterprise across the public Internet 

   o  Enterprise to Service Provider across the public Internet 

   o  Service Provider to Service Provider across the public Internet 

   o  Enterprise to enterprise across a private Layer 3 network 

   o  Enterprise to Service Provider across a private Layer 3 network 

   o  Service Provider to Service Provider across a private Layer 3 
      network 

   The members of a federation may jointly use a set of functions such 
   as location peering function, application function, subscriber 
   database function, SIP proxies, and/or functions that synthesize 
   various SIP and non-SIP based applications. Similarly, two providers 
   may jointly use a set of peering functions. The federation functions 
   or the peering functions can be either public or private.

3. Procedures 

   This document assumes that a call from an end user in the initiating 
   peer goes through the following steps to establish a call to an end 
   user in the receiving peer:  

                 . the analysis of a target address, 

                 . the discovery of the receiving peering point 
                    address, 

                 . the enforcement of authentication and other policy, 

                 . the discovery of end user address,  

                 . the routing of SIP messages, 

                 . the session establishment,  

                 . the transfer of media, 

                 . and the session termination.  

4. Reference SPEERMINT Architecture 

   Figure 2 depicts the SPEERMINT reference architecture and logical 
   functions that form the peering between two SIP service providers I 
   and R, where I is the Initiating peer and R is the Receiving peer.

   The procedures presented in Chapter 3 are implemented by a set of 
   peering functions:  

   o  Location Function (LF): Purpose is to develop call routing data 
      (CRD) by discovering the Signaling Function (SF), Policy Function 
      (PF), and end user's reachable host (IP address and port). 

   o  Policy Function (PF): Purpose is to perform authentication and to 
      exchange policy parameters to be used by the SF.  

   o  Signaling Function (SF): Purpose is to perform routing of SIP 
      messages, to optionally perform termination and re-initiation of 
      call, to optionally implement security and policies on SIP 
      messages, and to assist in discovery/exchange of parameters to be 
      used by the Media Function (MF).  

   o  Media Function (MF): Purpose is to perform media related function 
      such as media transcoding and media security implementation 
      between two SIP providers.  

   The intention of defining these functions is to provide a framework 
   for design segmentation and allow each one to evolve separately. 

5. Peer Function Examples 

   This section describes the peering functions in more detail and 
   provides some examples on the role they would play in a SIP call in a 
   Layer 5 peering scenario.

Internet-Draft    draft-ietf-speermint-architecture-00      August 2006 
    

   Some of the information in the chapter is taken from [4]. 

5.1. The Location Function (LF) of an Initiating Provider 

   Purpose is to develop call routing data (CRD) [1] by discovering the 
   Signaling Function (SF), Policy Function (PF), and end user's 
   reachable host (IP address and host). The LF of an Initiating 
   provider analyzes target address and discovers the next hop 
   signaling function (SF) in a peering relationship using DNS, SIP 
   Redirect Server, or a functional equivalent database.   

5.1.1. Target address analysis 

   When the initiating provider receives a request to communicate, the 
   initiating provider analyzes the target state data to determine 
   whether the call needs to be terminated internal or external to its 
   network. The analysis method is internal to the provider's policy; 
   thus, outside the scope of SPEERMINT. Note that the peer is free to 
   consult any manner of private data sources to make this 
   determination. 

   If the target address does not represent a resource inside the 
   initiating peer's administrative domain or federation of domains, the 
   initiating provider resolves the call routing data by using the 
   Location Function (LF). Examples of the LF are the functions of ENUM, 
   Routing Table, SIP DNS, and SIP Redirect Server. 

   If the request to communicate is for an im: or pres: URI type, the 
   initiating peer follows the procedures in [RFC3861].  If the highest 
   priority supported URI scheme is sip: or sips:, the initiating peer 
   skips to SIP DNS resolution in Section 5.1.5. Likewise, if the target 
   address is already a sip: or sips: URI in an external domain, the 
   initiating peer skips to SIP DNS resolution in Section 5.1.5.5.1.5.  

   If the target address corresponds to a specific E.164 address, the 
   peer may need to perform some form of number plan mapping according 
   to local policy.  For example, in the United States, a dial string 
   beginning "011 44" could be converted to "+44", or in the United 
   Kingdom "00 1" could be converted to "+1".  Once the peer has an 
   E.164 address, it can use ENUM. 

5.1.2. User ENUM Lookup 

   If an external E.164 address is the target, the initiating peer 
   consults the public "User ENUM" rooted at e164.arpa, according to the    
   procedures described in RFC 3761.  The peer MUST query for the 
   "E2U+sip" enumservice as described in RFC 3674 [11], but MAY check 
 
 
penno                  Expires February 8, 2007                [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft    draft-ietf-speermint-architecture-00      August 2006 
    

   for other enumservices.  The initiating peer MAY consult a cache or 
   alternate representation of the ENUM data rather than actual DNS 
   queries.  Also, the peer MAY skip actual DNS queries if the 
   initiating peer is sure that the target address country code is not 
   represented in e164.arpa.  If a sip: or sips: URI is chosen the peer 
   skips to Section 5.1.5. 

   If an im: or pres: URI is chosen for based on an "E2U+im" [10] or 
   "E2U+pres" [RFC3953] enumserver, the peer follows the procedures for 
   resolving these URIs to URIs for specific protocols such a SIP or 
   XMPP as described in the previous section. 

5.1.3. Carrier ENUM lookup 

   Next the initiating peer checks for a carrier-of-record in a carrier 
   ENUM domain according to the procedures described in [11].  As in the 
   previous step, the peer MAY consult a cache or alternate 
   representation of the ENUM data in lieu of actual DNS queries.  The 
   peer first checks for records for the "E2U+sip" enumservice, then for 
   the "E2U+pstn" enumservice as defined in [12].  If a terminal record 
   is found with a sip: or sips: URI, the peer skips to Section 5.1.5, 
   otherwise the peer continues processing according to the next 
   section. 

5.1.4. Routing Table 

   If there is no user ENUM records and the initiating peer cannot 
   discover the carrier-of-record or if the initiating peer cannot reach 
   the carrier-of-record via SIP peering, the initiating peer still 
   needs to deliver the call to the PSTN or reject the call.  Note that 
   the initiating peer MAY still sends the call to another provider for 
   PSTN gateway termination by prior arrangement using a routing table.  
   If so, the initiating peer rewrites the Request-URI to address the 
   gateway resource in the target provider's domain and MAY forward the 
   request on to that provider using the procedures described in the 
   remainder of these steps. 

5.1.5. SIP DNS Resolution 

   Once a sip: or sips: in an external domain is selected as the target, 
   the initiating peer uses the procedures described in [RFC3263] 
   Section 4. To summarize the RFC 3263 procedure: unless these are 
   explicitly encoded in the target URI, a transport is chosen using 
   NAPTR records, a port is chosen using SRV records, and an address is 
   chosen using A or AAAA records.  Note that these are queries of 
   records in the global DNS.

Internet-Draft    draft-ietf-speermint-architecture-00      August 2006 
    

5.1.6. SIP Redirect Server   

   A SIP Redirect Server may help in resolving current address of a 
   mobile target address. 

5.2. The Location Function (LF) of a Receiving Provider 

5.2.1. Publish ENUM records 

   The receiving peer SHOULD participate by publishing "E2U+sip" and 
   "E2U+pstn" records with sip: or sips: URIs wherever a public carrier 
   ENUM root is available.  This assumes that the receiving peer wants 
   to peer by default.  Even when the receiving peer does not want to 
   accept traffic from specific initiating peers, it MAY still reject 
   requests on a case-by-case basis. 

5.2.2. Publish SIP DNS records 

   To receive peer requests, the receiving peer MUST insure that it   
   publishes appropriate NAPTR, SRV, and address (A and/or AAAA) records    
   in the global DNS that resolve an appropriate transport, port, and   
   address to a relevant SIP server.   

5.3. Policy Function (PF) 

   Policy function is optional. The purpose of policy function is to 
   perform authentication and to exchange peering policy capabilities to 
   be used by the signaling function. 

   The policy capabilities should be specified through well defined XML 
   schemas. These policies define the capabilities of each peer and its 
   devices used for peering. For example, the following capabilities 
   could be exchanged through the policy function: 

   o  Adjacency (Next hop network attributes) 

       o If there are many adjacent proxies to use, the choice could be 
          based on:  

            . Location of the proxy 

            . Maximum number of calls per second (CPS) 

            . Maximum number of established calls

   The Policy function can be implemented by method such as described in 
   [6] as subscribe-notify. 

   The authentication policy function can be implemented by TLS (as 
   described in (5.3.1), IPSec or any other method that meet the 
   security needs to a specific deployment.   

   Editor's Note: This section will be updated based on the progress on 
   the SPEERMINT policy document. 

5.3.1. TLS  

   Once a transport, port, and address are found, the initiating peer 
   will open or find a reusable TLS connection to the peer.  The 
   initiating provider should verify the server certificate which should 
   be rooted in a well-known certificate authority.  The initiating 
   provider should be prepared to provide a TLS client certificate upon 
   request during the TLS handshake.  The client certificate should 
   contain a DNS or URI choice type in the subject AltName which 
   corresponds to the domain asserted in the host production of the From 
   header URI.  The certificate should be valid and rooted in a well- 
   known certificate authority. Note that the client certificate MAY 
   contain a list of entries in the subjectAltName, only one of which 
   has to match the domain in the From header URI.

   When the receiving peer receives a TLS client hello, it responds with 
   its certificate.  The receiving peer certificate SHOULD be valid and 
   rooted in a well-known certificate authority.  The receiving peer 
   should request and verify the client certificate during the TLS 
   handshake. 

5.3.2. IPSec 

       Editor's Note: will be described later. 

5.3.3. Subscribe Notify  

   Policy function may also be optionally implemented by dynamic 
   subscribe, notify, and exchange of policy information and feature 
   information among providers.  

5.4. Signaling Function (SF) 

   The purpose of signaling function is to perform routing of SIP 
   messages, to optionally perform termination and re-initiation of a 
   call, to optionally implement security and policies on SIP messages, 
   and to assist in discovery/exchange of parameters to be used by the 
   Media Function (MF).  

   The routing of SIP messages are performed by SIP proxies. The 
   optional termination and re-initiation of calls are performed by 
   B2BUA.  

   Optionally, a SF may perform additional functions such as Session 
   Admission Control, SIP Denial of Service protection, SIP Topology 
   Hiding, SIP header normalization, and SIP security, privacy and 
   encryption. 

   The signaling function can also process SDP payloads for media 
   information such as media type, bandwidth, and type of codec; then, 
   communicate this information to the media function. Signaling 
   function may optionally communicate with network layer to pass Layer 
   3 related policies [GATE] 

   Signaling Function supports the following RFCs as per SPEERMINT 
   Requirement document [2]: 

      o  SF MUST support the core SIP RFCs defined in SIP Hitchhikers   
         Guide [5]. 
    
      o  SF MUST support SDP related RFCs: the Session

         Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC2327], and the Offer/Answer 
         mechanism with SDP [RFC3264]. 
    
      o  SF SHOULD support: Reliability of Provisional 
         Responses in SIP - PRACK [RFC3262], the SIP UPDATE method (for 
         e.g. for codec changes during a session) [RFC3311], the Reason 
         header field [RFC3326]. 
 

5.5. Media Function (MF) 

   Examples of the media function is to transform voice payload from one 
   coding (e.g., G.711) to another (e.g., EvRC), media relaying, media 
   security, privacy, and encryption. 

   Editor's Note: This section will be further updated. 

6. Call Control and Media Control Deployment Options 

   The peering functions can either be deployed along the following two 
   dimensions depending upon how the signaling function and the media 
   function along with IP functions are implemented: 

   Composed or Decomposed:  Addresses the question whether the media 
   paths must flow through the same physical and geographic nodes as the 
   call signaling, 

   Centralized or Distributed:  Addresses the question whether the 
   logical and physical peering points are in one geographical location 
   or distributed to multiple physical locations on the service provider 
   network. 

   In a composed model, SF and MF functions are implemented in one 
   peering logical element.

             ... Scope of peering 
  
                 Figure 3: Decomposed v. Composed Peering 

   The advantage of composed peering architecture is that one-element 
   solves all peering issues. Disadvantage examples of this architecture 
   are single point failure, bottle neck, and complex scalability. 

   In a decomposed model, SF and MF are implemented in separate peering 
   logical elements. Signaling functions are implemented in a proxy and 
   media functions are implemented in another logical element.  The 
   scaling of signaling versus scaling of media may differ between 
   applications.  Decomposing allows each to follow a separate migration 
   path. 

   This model allows the implementation of M:N model where one SF is 
   associated with multiple peering MF and one peering MF is associated 
   with multiple peering proxies. Generally, a vertical protocol 
   associates the relationship between a SF and a MF. This architecture 
   reduces the potential of single point failure. This architecture, 
   allows separation of the policy decision point and the policy 
   enforcement point. An example of disadvantages is the scaling 
   complexity because of the M:N relationship and latency due to the 
   vertical control messages between entities.  

7. Security Considerations 

   In all cases, cryptographic-based security should be maintained as an 
   optional requirement between peering providers conditioned on the

   presence or absence of underlying physical security of peer 
   connections, e.g. within the same secure physical building.   

   In order to maintain a consistent approach, unique and specialized 
   security requirements common for the majority of peering 
   relationships, should be standardized within the IETF.  These 
   standardized methods may enable capabilities such as dynamic peering 
   relationships across publicly maintained interconnections. 

   TODO:  Address RFC-3552 BCP items.   

8. IANA Considerations 

   There are no IANA considerations at this time. 

9. Conclusions 

   The proposed peering reference architecture decomposes the peering 
   interface into a set of well defined functions.  Such an arrangement 
   allows each function to the specified and evolved separately.
