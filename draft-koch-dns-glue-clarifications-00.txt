Internet-Draft           DNS Glue Clarification             October 2005


1.  Introduction

   When delegating zones from a TLD or other DNS zone, some additional
   information is needed when resolving a name server's (as per an NS
   RR) address would involve the particular name server itself.  Such a
   dependency on itself, direct or indirect, may effectively shadow a
   part of a zone's NS RRSet, reducing redundancy, or even render the
   zone completely unresolvable.  This additional information is
   attached to a delegation my means of glue address records.  In the
   real life DNS multiple strategies to determine necessity or
   acceptance of glue records co-exist.  This document lists a subset of
   those approaches.

   This document also tries to clerify when and where to call an address
   record "glue record".

   Comments should be directed at the author.

   {This is a -00 version and thus will not pass the ID nits test.}


2.  Terms

   When the term "glue record" was introduced in [RFC0973], it was meant
   to denominate both data origin and purpose.  Data origin is related
   to the zone, although the glue records do not belong to the
   authoritative zone data.  The purpose is constrained to providing
   address information for name servers mentioned in NS RRs, which would
   otherwise not be resolvable.  Glue records are address information
   accompanying a delegation (in the delegating zone).

   There is sometimes confusion when data in a DNS response is also
   called "glue" data, e.g.  [RFC2010] starts speaking of "fetching"
   glue.  In a DNS response packet (answer or referral) the address
   information for name servers is carried in the additional section.
   This address information might have originated from glue records but
   might also come from cached or authoritative data.  DNS data in
   response packets should only be called "glue data" when it is certain
   and needs to be emphasized that it originates from glue records.


3.  Glue Policies

   In the DNS tree different policies are applied with respect to
   registering glue with the delegating zone.  "Registering" in this
   case means that the respective glue information is accepted,
   requested or required and than attached to the zone data so that it
   is available at all authoritative servers, i.e. the glue travels with

   the zone data by AXFR, IXFR or otherwise.  However, it does not make
   the glue data part of the zone's authoritative data.

   This is a list of existing glue policies:

   "never" or "null" Glue RRs are never registered.  This currently
      applies to larger parts of the IN-ADDR.ARPA reverse tree.

   "narrow" Glue RRs are registered if and only if the name server
      resides within or below the delegated (child) zone (that is,
      within the delegated domain).  This was suggested by [RFC1034].

   "wide" Glue RRs are registered if and only if the name server resides
      below the delegating (parent) zone.  There is no need to register
      glue RRs if the name server's name belongs into the parent zone.
      This was suggested by [RFC1033].  It is used for the root zone.

   "case by case" Glue RRs are registered following the "narrow" policy
      except where there are (circular) dependencies that demand
      additional glue RRs.

   "mandatory" Glue RRs are always registered for all name servers.
      This was suggested by [RFC0973].

   "other" Combinations of the above may exist, e.g. if a registry runs
      multiple sibling domains and decides to register glue RRs whenever
      a name server resides in or below one of the siblings.  This
      category would also include other policies like "random" or
      "arbitrary".

   Glue RRs are needed only in the delegating zone, regardless of glue
   policy.

   Various RFCs have identified extraneous glue RRs as sources of error
   and confusion ([RFC1713], [RFC1912]).


4.  Open Issues

   Future versions of this document will expand on these topics:

   o  Software issues when following NS RRs [I-D.minda-dnsop-using-in-
      bailiwick-nameservers]

   o  Should glue RRs be used in responses?

   o  TTL considerations

Internet-Draft           DNS Glue Clarification             October 2005


   o  Glue RRs for multihomed name servers


5.  DNSSEC Considerations

   DNSSEC signatures do not cover glue records [RFC3833], [RFC4033].


6.  IPv6 Considerations

   While this document makes no explicit statements about AAAA RRs,
   similar logic applies except in cases where A and AAAA glue RR
   interaction requires specific consideration (size, TTL, namespace
   fragmentation).

   The specification of the no longer preferred A6 RR [RFC2874] includes
   a detailed discussion due to the variable representation of IPv6
   addresses in A6.
