1.  Introduction

   Service function chaining (SFC) [RFC7665] involves steering traffic
   flows through a set of service functions in a specific order, such an
   ordered list of service functions is called a Service Function Chain
   (SFC).  The actual forwarding path used to realize an SFC is called
   the Service Function Path (SFP).  Network Service Headers (NSH)
   [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh] provides a mechanism to carry metadata between
   service functions.  The NSH structure is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh] and NSH data can be divided into two parts:

   o  Path information used to construct the SFP such as the SFP ID and
      Service Index.

   o  Metadata carrying the information about the packets being chained.

   Note that the payload encapsulated by NSH is not part of the NSH
   data.

   This document defines security requirments for NSH data and privacy
   requirements for NSH metadata.

2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  NSH Security and Privacy Requirements

   This section provides requirements and recommendation for the SFC
   Data Plane.

   REQ1:  In a SFC domain where attackers can modify NSH data or
          generate spoofed NSH data, NSH data MUST be authenticated and
          integrity protected.

   REQ2:  In a SFC domain where attackers can capture and replay NSH
          data, NSH data MUST provide a mechanism for replay detection
          and replay prevention mechanism MUST be enforced by the SF
          component processing the NSH data.

   REQ3:  In a SFC domain where attackers can modify the NSH
          encapsulated packet, NSH encapsulated packet MUST be
          authenticated and integrity protected.

   REQ4:  In a SFC domain where pervasive monitoring [RFC7258] is
          possible, NSH metadata MUST be encrypted and MUST NOT reveal
          privacy sensitive metadata to attackers.  Privacy specific
          threats are discussed in Section 5.2 of [RFC6973].

   REQ5:  TBD: To avoid fragmentation and amplification attacks, NSH
          data MUST be kept under Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
          including the byte overhead of the encapsulated packet.

   REQ6:  Negotiation of authentication, message integrity protection
          and encryption algorithms between SF components MUST be
          capable of detecting downgrade attacks.

   REQ7:  No device other than the SF components in the SFP SHOULD be
          able to update the integrity protected NSH data.  SF
          components not in the SFP SHOULD NOT hold the keying material
          to act on the NSH data.

   REQ8:  No device other than the SF components in the SFP SHOULD be
          able to decrypt and update the NSH metadata.  SF components
          not in the SFP SHOULD NOT hold the keying material to decrypt
          the NSH metadata.

4.  IANA Considerations

   None.

5.  Security Considerations

   NSH data is at risk from four primary attacks:

   o  A man-in-the middle attacker modifying NSH data.

   o  Attacker spoofing NSH data.

   o  Attacker capturing and replaying NSH data.

   o  NSH metadata revealing privacy sensitive information to attackers.

   In a SFC domain where all the above attacks are possible, NSH data
   MUST be authenticated, integrity protected, replay protection MUST be
   supported and NSH metadata MUST be encrypted for confidentiality.
