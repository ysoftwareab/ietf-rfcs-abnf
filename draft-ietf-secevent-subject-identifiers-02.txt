             Subject Identifiers for Security Event Tokens
               draft-ietf-secevent-subject-identifiers-02

Abstract

   Security events communicated within Security Event Tokens may support
   a variety of identifiers to identify the subject and/or other
   principals related to the event.  This specification formalizes the
   notion of subject identifiers as named sets of well-defined claims
   describing the subject, a mechanism for representing subject
   identifiers within a [JSON] object such as a JSON Web Token [JWT] or
   Security Event Token [SET], and a registry for defining and
   allocating names for these claim sets.

1.  Introduction

   As described in section 1.2 of [SET], the subject of a security event
   may take a variety of forms, including but not limited to a JWT
   principal, an IP address, a URL, etc.  Furthermore, even in the case
   where the subject of an event is more narrowly scoped, there may be
   multiple ways by which a given subject may be identified.  For
   example, an account may be identified by an opaque identifier, an
   email address, a phone number, a JWT "iss" claim and "sub" claim,
   etc., depending on the nature and needs of the transmitter and
   receiver.  Even within the context of a given transmitter and
   receiver relationship, it may be appropriate to identify different
   accounts in different ways, for example if some accounts only have
   email addresses associated with them while others only have phone
   numbers.  Therefore it can be necessary to indicate within a SET the
   mechanism by which the subject of the security event is being
   identified.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Subject Identifiers

   A Subject Identifier Type is a light-weight schema that describes a
   set of claims that identifies a subject.  Every Subject Identifier
   Type MUST have a unique name registered in the IANA "Security Event
   Subject Identifier Types" registry established by Section 4.1.  A
   Subject Identifier Type MAY describe more claims than are strictly
   necessary to uniquely identify a subject, and MAY describe conditions
   under which those claims are required, optional, or prohibited.

   A Subject Identifier is a [JSON] object containing a "subject_type"
   claim whose value is the unique name of a Subject Identifier Type,
   and a set of additional "payload claims" which are to be interpreted
   according to the rules defined by that Subject Identifier Type.
   Payload claim values MUST match the format specified for the claim by
   the Subject Identifier Type.  A Subject Identifier MUST NOT contain
   any payload claims prohibited or not described by its Subject
   Identifier Type, and MUST contain all payload claims required by its
   Subject Identifier Type.

   The following Subject Identifier Types are registered in the IANA
   "Security Event Subject Identifier Types" registry established by
   Section 4.1.

3.1.  Email Subject Identifier Type

   The Email Subject Identifier Type describes a subject that is a user
   account associated with an email address.  Subject Identifiers of
   this type MUST contain an "email" claim whose value is a string
   containing the email address of the subject, formatted as an "addr-
   spec" as defined in Section 3.4.1 of [RFC5322].  The "email" claim is
   REQUIRED and MUST NOT be null or empty.  The Email Subject Identifier
   Type is identified by the name "email".

   Below is a non-normative example Subject Identifier for the Email
   Subject Identifier Type:

     "subject_type": "email",
     "email": "user@example.com",
   }

        Figure 1: Example: Subject Identifier for the Email Subject
                             Identifier Type.

3.2.  Phone Number Subject Identifier Type

   The Phone Number Subject Identifier Type describes a subject that is
   a user account associated with a telephone number.  Subject
   Identifiers of this type MUST contain a "phone" claim whose value is
   a string containing the full telephone number of the subject,
   including international dialing prefix, formatted according to E.164
   [E164].  The "phone" claim is REQUIRED and MUST NOT be null or empty.
   The Phone Number Subject Identifier Type is identified by the name
   "phone".

   Below is a non-normative example Subject Identifier for the Email
   Subject Identifier Type:

   {
     "subject_type": "phone",
     "phone": "+12065550100",
   }

    Figure 2: Example: Subject Identifier for the Phone Number Subject
                             Identifier Type.

3.3.  Issuer and Subject Subject Identifier Type

   The Issuer and Subject Subject Identifier Type describes a subject
   that is an account identified by a pair of "iss" and "sub" claims, as
   defined by [JWT].  These claims MUST follow the formats of the "iss"
   claim and "sub" claim defined by [JWT], respectively.  Both the "iss"
   claim and the "sub" claim are REQUIRED and MUST NOT be null or empty.
   The Issuer and Subject Subject Identifier Type is identified by the
   name "iss-sub".

   Below is a non-normative example Subject Identifier for the Issuer
   and Subject Subject Identifier Type:

                         Subject Identifier Type.

3.4.  ID Token Claims Subject Identifier Type

   The ID Token Claims Subject Identifier Type describes a subject that
   was the subject of a previously issued ID Token [IDTOKEN].  It is
   intended for use when a variety of identifiers have been shared with
   the party that will be interpreting the Subject Identifier, and it is
   unknown which of those identifiers they require.  This type is
   identified by the name "id-token-claims".

   Subject Identifiers of this type MUST contain at least one of the
   following claims:

   email
      An "email" claim, as defined in [IDTOKEN].  If present, the value
      of this claim MUST NOT be null or empty.

   phone_number
      A "phone_number" claim, as defined in [IDTOKEN].  If present, the
      value of this claim MUST NOT be null or empty.

   sub
      A "sub" claim, as defined in [RFC7519].  If present, the value of
      this claim MUST NOT be null or empty.

   iss
      An "iss" claim, as defined in [RFC7519].  This claim is OPTIONAL,
      unless a "sub" claim in present, in which case it is REQUIRED.  If
      present, its value MUST NOT be null or empty.

   At least one of "email", "phone_number", or "sub" MUST be present.

   Below is a non-normative example Subject Identifier for the ID Token
   Claims Subject Identifier Type:

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  Security Event Subject Identifier Types Registry

   This document defines Subject Identifier Types, for which IANA is
   asked to create and maintain a new registry titled "Security Event
   Subject Identifier Types".  Initial values for the Security Event
   Subject Identifier Types registry are given in Section 3.  Future
   assignments are to be made through the Expert Review registration
   policy [BCP26] and shall follow the template presented in
   Section 4.1.1.

4.1.1.  Registration Template

   Type Name
      The name of the Subject Identifier Type, as described in
      Section 3.  The name MUST be an ASCII string consisting only of
      lower-case characters ("a" - "z"), digits ("0" - "9"), and hyphens
      ("-"), and SHOULD NOT exceed 20 characters in length.

   Type Description
      A brief description of the Subject Identifier Type.

   Change Controller
      For types defined in documents published by the OpenID Foundation
      or its working groups, list "OpenID Foundation RISC Working
      Group".  For all other types, list the name of the party
      responsible for the registration.  Contact information such as
      mailing address, email address, or phone number may also be
      provided.

   Defining Document(s)
      A reference to the document or documents that define the Subject
      Identifier Type.  The definition MUST specify the name, format,
      and meaning of each claim that may occur within a Subject
      Identifier of the defined type, as well as whether each claim is
      optional or required, or the circumstances under which the claim

4.1.3.  Guidance for Expert Reviewers

   The Expert Reviewer is expected to review the documentation
   referenced in a registration request to verify its completeness.  The
   Expert Reviewer must base their decision to accept or reject the
   request on a fair and impartial assessment of the request.  If the
   Expert Reviewer has a conflict of interest, such as being an author
   of a defining document referenced by the request, they must recuse
   themselves from the approval process for that request.  In the case
   where a request is rejected, the Expert Reviewer should provide the
   requesting party with a written statement expressing the reason for
   rejection, and be prepared to cite any sources of information that
   went into that decision.

   Subject Identifier Types need not be generally applicable and may be
   highly specific to a particular domain; it is expected that types may
   be registered for niche or industry-specific use cases.  The Expert
   Reviewer should focus on whether the type is thoroughly documented,
   and whether its registration will promote or harm interoperability.
   In most cases, the Expert Reviewer should not approve a request if
   the registration would contribute to confusion, or amount to a
   synonym for an existing type.

5.  Privacy Considerations

   There are no privacy considerations.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations.
