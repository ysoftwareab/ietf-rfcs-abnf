Internet-Draft         MCast Translation Framework         February 2011


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework] describes the framework for IPv4/
   IPv6 translation of unicast.  This document is a companion note to
   describe the framework for IPv4/IPv6 translation of multicast.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  In
   addition, this note uses the terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework].


3.  Translation Objectives

   Similar to unicast translation, the objective of multicast
   translation is enabling the source in one address family to deliver
   multicast packets to the receiver in a different address family.

   For multicast applications, there is usaully one source with one or
   more receivers.  In Any-Source Multicast (ASM), the receivers join
   the multicast distribution tree only depending on the multicast group
   address.  The multicast streams delivered by any source to that
   multicast group address will be accepted by the receivers.  In
   Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), the receivers join the multicast
   distribution tree depending on the mulitcast group address and source
   address pair.  Only mulitcast streams delivered by that given source
   to that multicast group address will be accepted by the receivers.

   Sometimes, multicast is used for local service discovery (e.g., OSPF
   Multicast addresses); however, we argue that this type of multicast
   should not be translated.  Multicast is also used for media delivery
   such as broadcast videos and live events.  In this memo, these are
   the primary services for translation.

   To enable multicast translation, both multicast protocols (e.g.,
   IGMP, PIM, etc.) and multicast packets are required to be translated.
   When designing solutions, the existing multicast protocols should be
   utilized as much as possible.  In addition, the framework should
   ensure the packet replication of multicast packets happens at the
   edge of the network close to the multicast receivers.

4.  Scenarios Overview

   Since the multicast data stream is unidirectional and is forwarded
   from the source to the receivers, there are generally two categories
   of IPv4/IPv6 translation scenarios per multicast stream:

   1.  From the IPv4 source to the IPv6 receivers.

   2.  From the IPv6 source to the IPv4 receivers.

   Note that a receiver of given multicast stream may become the source
   of another multicast stream.  As such, a multicast receiver may turn
   the received stream (i.e. which may pass through the translator too)
   and become the source of another receiver.  In the context of this
   document, they should be treated as two independent multicast
   streams.

4.1.  From the IPv4 source to the IPv6 receiver

   There is a requirement for the legacy IPv4 multicast source to
   provide services to the IPv6 receivers.



          +-----------+        +------------+        +----------+
          |   IPv6    | ...... |  Multicast | ...... |   IPv4   |

          +-----------+        +------------+        +----------+


                                 Figure 1

   In this case, the multicast traffic is IPv4 framed.  The IPv4-
   formatted multicast is translated to IPv6-formatted by a Multicast
   Translator (mXlate) and forwarded to the IPv6 receivers.  The
   procedures of multicast data subscribing and forwarding are different
   according to the different locations of the Multicast Translator.
   Refer to following sections for details.

4.2.  From the IPv6 source to the IPv4 receiver

   This scenario applies to the environment where the IPv6 multicast
   source may still need to provide services to the IPv4 receivers.

   In this case, the multicast traffic is IPv6 framed.  The IPv6-
   formatted multicast is translated to IPv4-formatted by a Multicast
   Translator (mXlate) and forwarded to the IPv4 receivers.  The
   procedures of multicast data subscribing and forwarding are different

                                 Figure 3

   The Multicast Translator (mXlate) places a special rule in the
   translation.  It joins both the IPv4 multicast distribution tree and
   IPv6 multicast distribution tree.  The mXlate is responsible for
   translating the multicast protocols then utilizing the multicast
   distribution tree to distribute the translated packets.  In this
   memo, we consider both Any-Source Multicast (ASM) and Source-Specific
   Multicast (SSM).

   Depending on the variable locations of the mXlate, each of the two
   translation scenarios (i.e. v4 source to v6 receivers; v6 source to
   v4 receivers) can be further divided into three scenarios.

   For IPv4->IPv6 (mXlate S4R6)

   Scenario 1: mXlate is not the DR of the IPv4 source

   Scenario 2: mXlate is the DR of the IPv4 source

   Scenario 3: mXlate is the MLD Querier

   For IPv6->IPv4 (mXlate S6R4)

   Scenario 4: mXlate is not the DR of the IPv6 source

   Scenario 5: mXlate is the DR of the IPv6 source

   Scenario 6: mXlate is the ICMP Querier

5.1.  Scenario 1: mXlate46 is not the DR of the IPv4 source

   In this scenario, the access network is an IPv6-only network, the
   multicast source is still IPv4 and it is in the IPv4 regime.  The
   mXlate will be deployed between the IPv4 and IPv6 regimes.  The
   mXlate is not directly connected to the source as such it is not the
   Designated Router of the IPv4 multicast source group.

   This is typical transition scenario in the early phase.  The access
   network is IPv6-only, but the multicast source is located in an IPv4
   network.  The mXlate is centralized in the network which can be used
   to serve multiple regions.  This scenario is suitable for early
   transition where there are not many IPv6 receivers requesting IPv4
   multicast sources.

5.2.  Scenario 2: mXlate is the DR of the IPv4 source

   In this scenario, the access network is an IPv6-only network, the
   multicast source is still IPv4.  The mXlate and the IPv4 multicast
   source is on the same network, and the mXlate is also the Designated
   Router.

   This could happen if the network and multicast receivers have
   migrated to IPv6; however, the multicast source have yet to migrate
   to IPv6. mXlate is directly connected to the multicast source and
   responsible for translating the IPv4 multicast packets to IPv6
   multicast packets to the IPv6 receivers.

5.3.  Scenario 3: mXlate is the MLD Querier

   In this scenario, the entire network is stll IPv4; however, the
   receiver is IPv6-only.  The mXlate is the immediate multicast router
   of the IPv6-only receiver.

   This scenario is a typical setup for ISPs which face a real shortage
   of IPv4 addresses for the new devices but not yet finished the entire
   network upgrade to IPv6 to support multicast.  IPv6 will be deployed
   between the edge router (e.g.  BNG) and home.

5.4.  Scenario 4: mXlate is not the DR of the IPv6 source

   In this scenario, an IPv4 multicast network with receivers is
   connected through mXlate to an IPv4 multicast network where the
   source is located.  The mXlate translates the IPv6 formatted
   mulitcast source to IPv4 and distributes translated packets through
   the multicast distribution tree in the IPv4 network.

   This could happen when the multicast source and majority of the
   network have been migrated to IPv6.  However, there are few IPv4
   islands left which still want to receive multicast packets from the
   IPv6 source.

5.5.  Scenario 5: mXlate is the DR of the IPv6 source

   In this scenario, the access network is IPv4-only network, the

   This could happen if there are still IPv4-only networks left after
   the source has been migrated to IPv6.  The mXlate behaves as DR
   connected to the IPv4 source and translate the multicast packets to
   IPv4 formatted which are then distributed in the IPv4 multicast
   network.

5.6.  Scenario 6: mXlate is the IGMP Querier

   In this scenario, the entire network is IPv6.  The multicast source
   is also IPv6-only.  However, there are some legacy IPv4 receivers
   which want to receive packets from the IPv6-only source.

   This scenario could happen after the operator has completely migrated
   to IPv6, but few IPv4-only receivers have yet to retire or to migrate
   to IPv6.  These IPv4-only receivers can be connected by mXlate which
   locates in the IGMP Querier.


6.  Translation Components

6.1.  Address Translation

   It is important for the mXlate to specify how an IPxX address is
   translated to an IPvY for the operations of mXlate.  Scenario 1, 2,
   and 3 require to translate an IPv4 multicast group to an IPv6
   multicast group.  This can be achieved by following the mechanisms
   defined in [I-D.boucadair-behave-64-multicast-address-format].  The
   mXlate creates a stateless mapping table of IPv4->IPv6 group
   addresses indicated by the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses and

   translates the IPv4 multicast packets into multicast packets based on
   the mapping table.

   Scenario 4, 5, and 6 require to translate an IPv6 multicast group to
   an IPv4 multicast group.  Since the IPv6 multicast group has much
   large address space than IPv4 multicast group, it is impossible to
   achieve an one-to-one mapping.  In fact, this creates a tough
   challenge to define an algorithm to translate an IPv6 multicast group
   to an IPv4 multicast group.  In practice, the mXlate can create a
   stateful mapping table of IPv6->IPv4 group addresses.  These entries
   are probably defined by the operators and each operator may have
   different definitions of the table.  As such, inter-domain multicast
   translation will require coordination.

6.2.  Multicast Translator (mXlate)

   mXlate plays two roles in the multicast translation.  It is
   responsible for translating the multicast control protocol from IPvX
   to IPvY (e.g., IGMP<->MLD) and translating the actual multicast data
   packets from IPvX to IPvY.  Depending on the deployment models (ASM
   vs. SSM), there are different considerations.

6.2.1.  mXlate in ASM

6.2.1.1.  mXlate Location

   In ASM deployment model, mXlate must be the "root" of the multicast
   distribution tree of the translated multicast group.  This is
   important because the mXlate maintains the mapping information to
   translate the IPvX to IPvY.

6.2.1.2.  Source Registration

   Source Registration happens when the source starts sourcing multicast
   packets.  The DR will send the Source Registration to the RP.  In the
   shared tree model, the RP will start replicate the packets to the
   interfaces where received the PIM-Join of the multicast group.
   Consider Scenario 1 and 4 where mXlate is not the DR of the multicast
   source.  If a receiver sends a PIMvX-Join of the translated multicast
   group to the RPvX, the RPvX will not know where the source is, so it
   will wait until it receives the Source Registration coming from
   mXlate.  Unfortunately the mXlate will never send the Source
   Registration because it is not the "DR" and the DRvY never knows that
   there is a RP of another address family waiting for the Source
   Registration.  In order to solve this problem, there are two ways:

Internet-Draft         MCast Translation Framework         February 2011


   1.  Configure the mXlate to become the RP of all the translated
       multicast addresses.

   2.  Configure the mXlate to join all the known IPvY-translated IPvY
       multicast groups to the RPvY and IPvY Sources send Source
       Registration to the RPvX regardless whether any receiver has
       asked to join the groups.

   This problem is unique to Scenario 1 and 4.  The reminding scenarios
   will not suffer from the same problem because the mXlate is the DR of
   the source in Scenario 2 and 5, and the mXlate is a simple MLD<->ICMP
   translator in Scenario 3 and 6.

6.2.2.  mXlate in SSM

6.2.2.1.  mXlate Location

   In SSM deployment model, mXlate must be the source of the SSM group
   of the translated multicast address group.  When the mXlate receives
   the PIMvX-Join, it would translate this to a PIMvY-Join to upstream
   multicast router.  The IPvX Source to IPvY Source mapping information
   is stateful and stored in the mXlate.

6.2.3.  Interchanging ASM and SSM

   mXlate is the bridging point of two multicast trees.  It is possible
   that the mXlate runs SSM in the IPvX domain and ASM in the IPvY
   domain or vice versa.  For example: In Scenario 1, if the IPv6
   network runs SSM and the IPv4 runs ASM, this could potentially solve
   the problem of Source Registration described in Section 6.2.1.2.
