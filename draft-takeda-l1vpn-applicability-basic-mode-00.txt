Abstract 
    
   This document provides an applicability statement on the use of 
   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and 
   mechanisms to support Basic Mode Layer 1 Virtual Private Networks 
   (L1VPNs). 
    
   L1VPNs provide customer services and connectivity at layer 1 over 
   layer 1 networks. The operation of L1VPNs is divided into the Basic 
   Mode and the Enhanced Mode where the Basic Mode of operation does not 
   feature any exchange of routing information between the layer 1 
   network and the customer domain. This document examines how GMPLS

2. Terminology 
    
   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology in 
   [RFC3031], [RFC3209], [RFC3471], [RFC3473], [RFC4202], [RFC4026] and 
   [L1VPN-FW]. 
    
3. Introduction 
    
   This document provides an applicability statement on the use of 
   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and 
   mechanisms to Basic Mode Layer 1 Virtual Private Networks (L1VPNs) as 
   specified in [L1VPN-FW]. 
    
   The operation of L1VPNs is divided into the Basic Mode and the 
   Enhanced Mode. The Basic Mode of operation does not feature any 
   exchange of routing information between the layer 1 network and the 
   customer domain, while the Enhanced Mode of operation features 
   exchange of routing information between the layer 1 network and the 
   customer domain. 
    
   The main GMPLS protocols and mechanisms applicable to the L1VPN Basic 
   Mode are [L1VPN-BM], [L1VPN-BGP-DISC], and [L1VPN-OSPF-DISC], along 
   with several other documents referenced within this document. 
    
   Note that discussion in this document is focused on areas where GMPLS 
   protocols and mechanisms are relevant. 
    
4. Basic Mode Overview 
    
   As described in [L1VPN-FW], in the Basic Mode service model, there is 
   no routing exchange between the CE and the PE. CE-CE VPN connections 
   are set up by GMPLS signaling between the CE and the PE, and then 
   across the provider network. A VPN connection is limited to the 
   connection between CEs belonging to the same VPN. 
    
   Note that in L1VPNs, routing operates within the provider network and 
   may be used by PEs to exchange information specific to the VPNs 
   supported by the provider network (e.g., membership information). 
    
   In the L1VPN Basic Mode, the provider network is completely under the 
   control of the provider. This includes the PE-PE segment of the CE-CE 
   VPN connection that is controlled and computed by the provider (PE-PE 
   segment control). On the other hand, the VPN itself, constructed from 
   a set of CEs and the VPN connections provided by the provider, is

draft-takeda-l1vpn-applicability-basic-mode-00.txt        October 2006 
 
 
   under the control of each customer. This includes that a customer can 
   request between which CEs a connection is to be established (topology 
   control). Note that a customer may outsource the management of its 
   VPN to a third party, including to the provider itself. There is a 
   confidentiality requirement between the provider and each customer. 
    
   [L1VPN-BM], which expands [RFC4208], specifies GMPLS signaling to 
   establish CE-CE VPN connections.  
    
   [L1VPN-BGP-DISC] and [L1VPN-OSPF-DISC] specify alternative mechanisms 
   to exchange membership information between PEs, based on BGP and OSPF 
   respectively. 
    
5. Supported Network Types 
    
5.1 Data Plane 
    
   The provider network can be constructed from any type of layer 1 
   switches, such as Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) switches, Optical 
   Cross-Connects (OXCs), or Photonic Cross-Connects (PXCs).  
   Furthermore, a PE may be an Ethernet Private Line (EPL) type of 
   device, that maps Ethernet frames onto layer 1 connections (by means 
   of Ethernet over TDM etc.). The provider network may be constructed 
   from switches providing a single switching granularity (e.g., only 
   VC3 switches), or from switches providing multiple switching 
   granularities (e.g., from VC3/VC4 switches, or from VC3 switches and 
   OXCs). The provider network may provide a single type of VPN 
   connection (e.g., VC3 connections only), or multiple types of 
   connection (e.g., VC3/VC4 connections, or VC3 connections and 
   wavelength connections). 
    
   A CE does not have to have the capability to switch at layer 1, but 
   it must be capable of receiving a layer 1 signal and either switching 
   it or terminating it with adaptation. 
    
   As described in [L1VPN-FW] and [L1VPN-BM], a CE and a PE are 
   connected by one or more links. A CE may also be connected to more 
   than one PE, and a PE may have more than one CE connected to it. 
    
   A CE may belong to a single VPN, or to multiple VPNs, and a PE may 
   support one or more VPNs through a single CE or through multiple CEs. 
    
5.2 Control Plane 
    
   The provider network is controlled by GMPLS. L1VPN Basic Mode 
   provider networks are limited to a single AS within the scope of this 
   document. Multi-AS Basic Mode L1VPNs are for future study.

draft-takeda-l1vpn-applicability-basic-mode-00.txt        October 2006 
 
 
   As described in [L1VPN-FW] and [L1VPN-BM], a CE and a PE need to be 
   connected by at least one control channel. It is necessary to 
   disambiguate control plane messages exchanged between a CE and a PE 
   if the CE-PE relationship is applicable to more than one VPN. This 
   makes it possible to determine to which VPN such control plane 
   messages apply. Such disambiguation can be achieved by allocating a 
   separate control channel to each VPN (either using a separate 
   physical channel, a separate logical channel such as an IP tunnel, or 
   using separate addressing). 
    
   GMPLS allows any type of control channel to be used, as long as there 
   is IP level reachability. In the L1VPN context, instantiation of a 
   control channel between a CE and a PE may differ depending on 
   security requirements, etc. This is discussed in Section 10. 
    
6. Addressing 
    
   As described in [L1VPN-BM], the L1VPN Basic Mode allows that customer 
   addressing realms overlap with each other, and also overlap with the 
   service provider addressing realm. That is, a customer network may 
   re-use addresses used by the provider network, and may re-use 
   addresses used in another customer network supported by the same 
   provider network. This is the same as in any other VPN model. 
    
   In addition, the L1VPN Basic Mode allows a CE-PE control channel 
   addressing realm overlap. Furthermore, once a VPN connection has been 
   established, the L1VPN Basic Mode does not enforce any restriction on 
   address assignment for this VPN connection (treated as a link) for 
   customer network operation (e.g., IP network, MPLS network). 
    
7. Provider Control of its Infrastructure 
    
7.1 Provisioning Model 
    
   As described in [L1VPN-BM], for each VPN that has at least one 
   customer-facing port on a given PE, the PE maintains a Port 
   Information Table (PIT) associated with that VPN. A PIT provides a 
   cross-reference between Customer Port Indices (CPIs) and Provider 
   Port Indices (PPIs) and contains a list of <CPI, PPI> tuples for all 
   the ports within the VPN. In addition, for local PE ports of a given 
   VPN the PE retains an identifier known as the VPN-PPI, and this is 
   stored in the PIT with the <CPI, PPI> tuples. 
    
   When a new CE belonging to one or more VPNs is added to a PE, PIT 
   entries associated to those VPNs need to be configured on the PE. 
   Section 4 of [L1VPN-BM] specifies such procedures: 
    
   - If no PIT exists for the VPN on the PE, a new PIT is created by the 
     provider and associated with the VPN identifier. 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.          Expires April 2007                  [Page 5] 
draft-takeda-l1vpn-applicability-basic-mode-00.txt        October 2006 
 
 
    
   - The PIT (new or pre-existing) is updated to include information 
     related to the newly added CE. The VPN-PPI, PPI, and CPI are 
     installed in the PIT. Note that the PPI is well-known by the PE, 
     but the CPI must be discovered either through manual configuration 
     or automatically by mechanisms such as the Link Management Protocol 
     (LMP) [RFC4204]. In addition, a CE to PE control channel needs to 
     be configured. 
    
   - The updated PIT information needs to be configured in the PITs on 
     remote PE associated with the VPN. For such purpose, manual 
     configuration, or some sort of auto-discovery mechanisms can be 
     used. [L1VPN-BGP-DISC] and [L1VPN-OSPF-DISC] specifies alternative 
     auto-discovery mechanisms. 
    
   - In addition, remote PIT information associated with the VPN needs 
     to be configured on this PE if the PIT has been newly created. 
     Again, this can be achieved through manual configuration or through 
     auto-discovery, [L1VPN-BGP-DISC] and [L1VPN-OSPF-DISC]. 
    
   When VPN membership of an existing CE changes, or when a CE is 
   removed from a PE, similar procedures need to be applied to update 
   the local and remote PITs. 
    
7.2 PE-PE Segment Control 
    
   In L1VPN Basic mode, a PE-PE segment of a CE-CE VPN connection is 
   completely under the control of provider network. 
    
7.2.1 Path Computation and Establishment 
    
   A PE-PE segment of a CE-CE VPN connection may be established based on 
   various policies. Those policies can be applied per VPN or per VPN 
   connection. The policy is configured by the provider, possibly based 
   on the contracts with each customer. 
    
   Examples of PE-PE segment connection establishment polices supported 
   in the L1VPN Basic Mode are as follows. 
    
   - Policy 1: On-demand establishment, on-demand path computation 
   - Policy 2: On-demand establishment, pre-computed path 
   - Policy 3: Pre-establishment, pre-computed path 
    
   In each policy, the PE-PE path may be computed by the local PE, or by 
   a path computation entity outside of the local PE (e.g., a Path 
   Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655], or management systems). 
    
   In policies 2 and 3, pre-computation of paths (and pre-establishment 
   if applicable) can be done at the network planning phase, or just 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.          Expires April 2007                  [Page 6] 
draft-takeda-l1vpn-applicability-basic-mode-00.txt        October 2006 
 
 
   before signaling (e.g., triggered by an off-line customer request). 
   As the result of pre-computation (and pre-establishment), there could 
   be multiple PE-PE segments for a specific pair of PEs. When a PE 
   receives a Path message from a CE for a VPN connection, a PE needs to 
   determine which PE-PE segment to use. In such cases, the provider may 
   want to control: 
    
   - Which VPN uses which PE-PE VPN segment. 
   - Which CE-CE VPN connection uses which PE-PE VPN segment. 
    
   The former requires mapping between the PIT and the PE-PE segment. 
   The latter requires some more sophisticated mapping method, for 
   example: 
    
   - Mapping between individual PIT entries and PE-PE segments. 
   - Use of a Path Key ID [Conf-Segment] supplied by the provider to the 
     CE, and signaled by the CE as part of the VPN connection request.  
    
   The L1VPN Basic Mode does not preclude usage of other methods, if 
   applicable. 
    
   In policy 3, stitching or nesting is necessary in order to map the 
   CE-CE VPN connection to a pre-established PE-PE segment. 
    
7.2.2 Resource Management 
    
   The provider network may operate resource management based on various 
   policies. These policies can be applied per VPN or per VPN  
   connection. The policy is configured by the provider, possibly based 
   on the contracts with each customer. 
    
   For example, a provider may choose to partition the resources of the 
   provider network for limited use by different VPNs or customers. Such 
   a function might be achieved within the scope of the Basic Mode using 
   resource affinities [RFC3209], but the details of per-VPN resource 
   models (especially in terms of CE-PE routing) are considered as part 
   of the Enhanced Mode. 
    
7.2.3 Consideration of CE-PE TE information 
    
   [L1VPN-OSPF-DISC] and [BGP-TE] allow CE-PE TE link information to be 
   injected into the provider network. This may be helpful for the 
   ingress PE to prevent connection setup failure due to lack of 
   resources or incompatible switching capabilities on remote CE-PE TE 
   links. 
    
   Furthermore, the L1VPN Basic Mode allows a remote CE to be reached 
   through more than one TE link connected to the same PE (single-homed) 
   or to different PEs (dual-homed). In such cases, to facilitate route

draft-takeda-l1vpn-applicability-basic-mode-00.txt        October 2006 
 
 
   choice, the ingress CE needs to initiate signaling by specifying the 
   egress CE's router ID not the egress CPI in the Session Object and 
   ERO (if present) so as to not constrain the choice of route within 
   the provider network. Therefore, the CE's router ID needs to be 
   configured in the PITs. 
    
   Note that, as described in Section 9.2, consideration of the full 
   feature set enabled by dual-homing (such as resiliency) is out of 
   scope of the L1VPN Basic Mode. 
    
7.3 Connectivity Restriction 
    
   The L1VPN Basic Mode allows restricting connection establishment 
   between CEs belonging to the same VPN for policy reasons (including 
   VPN security). Since the PIT at each PE is associated with a VPN, 
   this function can be easily supported. The restriction can be applied 
   at the ingress PE or at the egress PE according to the applicable 
   restriction policy, but note that applying the policy at the egress 
   may waste signaling effort within the network as VPN connections are 
   pointlessly attempted. 
    
   In addition, the L1VPN Basic Mode does not restrict use of any 
   advanced admission control based on various policies. 
    
8. Customer Control of its VPN 
    
8.1 Topology Control 
    
   In the L1VPN Basic Mode, VPN connection topology is controlled by the 
   customer. That is, a customer can request setup/deletion/modification 
   of VPN connections using signaling mechanisms specified in  
   [L1VPN-BM]. 
    
   Also note that if there are multiple CE-PE TE links (single-homed or 
   multi-homed), a customer can specify which CE-PE TE link to use to 
   support any VPN connection. Alternatively, a customer may let the 
   provider choose the CE-PE TE link at the egress side, as described in 
   Section 6.2.3. 
    
8.2 Note on Routing 
    
   A CE needs to obtain the remote CPI to which it wishes to request a 
   connection. Since, in the L1VPN Basic Mode, there is no routing 
   information exchange between a CE and a PE, there is no dynamic 
   mechanism supported as part of the Basic Mode L1VPN service, and the 
   knowledge of remote CPIs must be acquired in a VPN-specific way, 
   perhaps through configuration or through a directory server. 
    

 
 
T.Takeda, et al.          Expires April 2007                  [Page 8] 
draft-takeda-l1vpn-applicability-basic-mode-00.txt        October 2006 
 
 
   If a VPN is used by a customer to operate a private IP network, the 
   customer may wish to form routing adjacencies over the CE-CE VPN 
   connections. The L1VPN Basic Mode does not enforce any restriction on 
   such operation by a customer, and the use made of the VPN connections 
   is transparent to the provider network. 
    
   Furthermore, if a VPN is used by a customer to operate a private 
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) or GMPLS network, the customer 
   may wish to treat a VPN connection as a Traffic Engineering (TE)  
   link, and this requires a CE-CE control channel. Note that a 
   Forwarding Adjacency [RFC4206] cannot be formed from the CE-CE VPN 
   connection in the Basic Mode because there is no routing exchange 
   between CE and PE - that is, the customer network and the provider 
   network do not share a routing instance, and the customer control 
   channel cannot be carried within the provider control plane. But 
   where the CE provides suitable adaptation (for example, where the 
   customer network is a packet-switched MPLS or GMPLS network) the 
   customer control channel may be in-band and a routing adjacency may 
   be formed between the CEs using the VPN connection. Otherwise, CE-CE 
   control plane connectivity may form part of the L1VPN service 
   provided to the customer by the provider and may be achieved within 
   the L1VPN connection (for example, through the use of overhead bytes) 
   or through a dedicated control channel connection or tunnel. The 
   options available are discussed further in Section 10.2 of  
   [L1VPN-FW]. 
    
    
9. Scalability, Resiliency 
    
9.1 Scalability 
    
   There are several factors that impact scalability. 
    
   o Number of VPNs (PITs) configured on each PE 
    
     With the increase of this number, information to be maintained on 
     the PE increases. Theoretically, the upper limit of the number of 
     VPNs supported in a provider network is governed by how the ID 
     associated with a VPN is allocated, and the number of PITs 
     configured on each PE is limited by this number. However, 
     implementations may impose arbitrary limits on the number of PITs 
     supported by any one PE. 
    
   o Number of CE-PE TE links for each VPN 
    
     With the increase of this number, information to be maintained in 
     each PIT increases. When auto-discovery mechanisms are used, the 
     amount of information that an auto-discovery mechanism can support 
     may restrict this number. 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.          Expires April 2007                  [Page 9] 
draft-takeda-l1vpn-applicability-basic-mode-00.txt        October 2006 
 
 
    
     Note that [L1VPN-OSPF-DISC] floods membership information not only 
     among PEs, but also to all P nodes. This may lead to scalability 
     concerns, compared to [L1VPN-BGP-DISC], which distributes 
     membership information only among PEs. Alternatively, a separate 
     instance of the OSPF protocol can be used just between PEs for 
     distributing membership information. In such a case, Ps do not 
     participate in flooding. 
    
     Note that in the L1VPN Basic Mode, a PE needs to obtain only CE-PE 
     TE link information, and not customer routing information, which is 
     quite different from the mode of operation of a L3VPN. Therefore, 
     the scalability concern is considered to be less problematic. 
    
   o Number of VPN connections 
    
     With the increase of this number, information to be maintained on 
     each PE/P increases. When stitching or nesting is used, states to 
     be maintained at PE increase compared to when connectivity is 
     achieved without stitching or nesting. 
    
     However, in a layer 1 core, this number is always bounded by the 
     available physical resource because each LSP uses a separate label 
     which is directly bound to a physical, switchable resource 
     (timeslot, lambda, fiber). Thus, it can be safely assumed that the 
     PEs/Ps can comfortably handle the number of LSPs that they may be 
     called on to switch for a L1VPN. 
    
9.2 Data Plane Resiliency 
    
   The L1VPN Basic Mode supports following data plane recovery 
   techniques [L1VPN-BM]. 
    
   o PE-PE segment recovery 
    
     - If LSP stitching or LSP hierarchy are used to provision the PE-PE 
       segment, then the PE-PE LSP may be protected using end-to-end 
       recovery within the provider network. 
    
     - If the CE-CE VPN connection is a single end-to-end LSP (including 
       if session shuffling is used), then the PE-PE LSP segment may be 
       protected using segment protection [SEG-PROT] 
    
   o CE-PE recovery and PE-PE recovery via link protection 
    
     - The CE-PEs link may be protected at a lower layer and GMPLS 
       signaling may request the use of link-level protection 
    
     - If the PE-PE segment is provided as a single TE link (stitching

       or hierarchy) so that the provider network can perform simple PE- 
       to-PE routing, then the TE link may offer link-level protection 
       through the instantiation of multiple PE-PE LSPs. 
    
     - The PE-PE segment may be provisioned using only link-protected 
       links within the core network. 
    
   Note that it is not possible to protect only CE-PE portion or PE-PE 
   portion by link protection because the CE-CE signaling request asks 
   for a certain level of link protection on all links used by the LSP. 
   Also, it is no possible to protect CE-PE portion by link recovery and 
   PE-PE portion by segment recovery at the same time. 
    
   CE-CE recovery through the use connections from one CE to diverse PEs 
   (i.e., dual-homing) is not supported in the L1VPN Basic Mode. 
    
9.3 Control Plane Resiliency 
    
   The L1VPN Basic Mode allows use of GMPLS control plane resiliency 
   mechanisms. This includes, but not limited to, control channel 
   management in LMP [RFC4204] and fault handling in RSVP-TE [RFC3473] 
   between a CE and a PE as well as within the provider network. 
    
10. Security 
    
   Security considerations are described in [L1VPN-FW], and this section 
   describes how these considerations are addressed in the L1VPN Basic 
   Mode. 
    
10.1 Topology Confidentiality 
    
   As specified in [L1VPN-BM], a provider's topology confidentiality is 
   preserved by the Basic Mode. Since there is no routing exchange 
   between PE and CE, the customer network can gather no information 
   about the provider network. Further, as described in Section 4 of 
   [RFC4208], a PE may filter the information present in a Record Route 
   Object (RRO) that is signaled from the provider network to the 
   customer network. In addition, as described in Section 5 of [RFC4208] 
   and Section 4.4 of [L1VPN-BM], when a Notify message is sent to a CE, 
   it is possible to hide the provider internal address. This is 
   accomplished by a PE updating the Notify Node Address with its own 
   address when the PE receives NOTIFY_REQUEST object from the CE. 
    
   Even in the case of pre-computed and/or pre-signaled PE-PE segments, 
   provider topology confidentiality may be preserved through the use of 
   path key IDs [Conf-Segment]. 
    
   The customer's topology confidentiality cannot be completely hidden 
   from the provider network. At the least, the provider network will 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.          Expires April 2007                 [Page 11] 
draft-takeda-l1vpn-applicability-basic-mode-00.txt        October 2006 
 
 
   know about the addresses and locations of CEs. Other customer 
   topology information will remain hidden from the provider in the 
   Basic Mode although care may be needed to protect the customer 
   control channel as described in Section 10.4. 
    
   The provider network is responsible for maintaining confidentiality 
   of topology information between customers and across VPNs. Since 
   there is no distribution of routing information from PE to CE in the 
   Basic Mode, there is no mechanism by which the provider could 
   accidentally, or deliberately but automatically, distribute this 
   information. 
    
10.2 External Control of the Provider Network 
    
   The provider network is protected from direct control from within 
   customer networks through policy and through filtering of signaling 
   messages. 
    
   There is a service-based policy installed at each PE that directs how 
   a PE should react to a VPN connection request received from any CE. 
   Each CE is configured at the PE (or through a policy server) for its 
   membership of a VPN, and so CEs cannot dynamically bind to a PE or 
   join a VPN. With this configuration comes the policy that tells the 
   PE how to react to a VPN connection request (for example, whether to 
   allow dynamic establishment of PE-PE connections). Thus, the provider 
   network is protected against spurious VPN connection requests and can 
   charge for all VPN connections according to the service agreement 
   with the customers. Hence the provider network is substantially 
   protected against denial of service attacks. 
    
   At the same time, if a Path message from a CE contains an Explicit 
   Route Object (ERO) specifying the route within provider network, it 
   is rejected by the PE. Thus, the customer network has no control over 
   the resources in the provider network. 
    
10.3 Data Plane Security 
    
   As described in [L1VPN-FW], at layer 1, data plane information is 
   normally assumed to be secure once connections are established since 
   those connections are dedicated VPNs. That is, it is not possible to 
   communicate unless there is a connection. 
    
   In order to protect against mis-delivery, each VPN connection is 
   restricted to use only within a single VPN. That is, a VPN connection 
   does not connect CEs that are in different VPNs. In order to realize 
   this, the identity of CEs is assured as part of the service contract. 
   And upon receipt of a request for connection setup, the provider 
   network assures that the connection is requested between CEs 

 
 
T.Takeda, et al.          Expires April 2007                 [Page 12] 
draft-takeda-l1vpn-applicability-basic-mode-00.txt        October 2006 
 
 
   belonging to the same VPN. This is achieved as described in Section 
   7.3. 
    
   Furthermore, customers can apply their own security mechanisms to 
   protect data plane information (CE-CE security). This includes IPsec 
   for IP traffic. 
    
10.4 Control Plane Security 
    
   There are two aspects for control plane security. 
    
   First, the entity connected over a CE-PE control channel must be 
   identified. This is done when a new CE is added as part of the 
   service contract and the necessary control channel is established. 
   This identification can use authentication procedures available in 
   RSVP-TE [RFC3209]. 
    
   Second, it must be possible to secure communication over a CE-PE 
   control channel. If a communication channel between the customer and 
   the provider (control channel, management interface) is physically 
   separate per customer, the communication channel could be considered 
   as secure. However, when the communication channel is physically 
   shared among customers, security mechanisms need to be available and 
   should be enforced. RSVP-TE [RFC3209] provides for tamper-protection 
   of signaling message exchanges. IPsec tunnels can further be used for 
   this purpose. 
    
   Note that even in the case of physically separate communication 
   channels, customers may wish to apply security mechanisms, such as 
   IPsec, to assure higher security, and such mechanisms must be 
   available. 
    
   Furthermore, the provider network need mechanisms to detect Denial of 
   Service (DoS) attacks and to protect against them reactively and 
   proactively. In the Basic Mode, this relies on management system(s). 
    
   Lastly, it should be noted that customer control plane traffic 
   carried over the provider network between CEs needs to be protected. 
   Such protection is normally the responsibility of the customer 
   network and can use the security mechanisms of the customer signaling 
   and routing protocols (for example, RSVP-TE [RFC3209]) or may use 
   IPsec tunnels between CEs. CE-CE control plane security may form part 
   of the data plane protection where the control plane traffic is 
   carried in-band in the VPN connection. Where the CE-CE control plane 
   connectivity is provided as an explicit part of the L1VPN service by 
   the provider, control plane security should form part of the service 
   agreement between the provider and customer.

11. Management 
    
   Manageability considerations are described in [L1VPN-FW]. In the 
   L1VPN Basic Mode, we rely on management system(s) for various aspects 
   of the different service functions, such as fault management, 
   configuration and policy management, accounting management, 
   performance management, and security management (as described in 
   Section 10). 
    
   Details are for further study.
