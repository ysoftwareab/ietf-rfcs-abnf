1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for modeling
   point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   traffic engineering (TE).

   MPLS is defined in [RFC3031] and a signaling protocol for
   point-to-point (P2P) MPLS-TE (TE extensions to the Resource
   Reservation Protocol - RSVP-TE) is defined in [RFC3209]. RSVP-TE is
   extended for use in a P2MP environment by [P2MP-TE] following the
   requirements set out in [RFC4461].

   [RFC3812] provides a MIB module for modeling and controlling P2P
   MPLS-TE in conjunction with Textual Conventions defined in [RFC3811].
   In addition, [RFC3813] defines a MIB module for modeling and
   controlling an MPLS label switching router (LSR) that may support
   MPLS-TE.

Internet Draft     draft-farrel-mpls-p2mp-te-mib-00.txt         May 2006

   This document defines a MIB module for managing and controlling P2MP
   MPLS-TE. It builds on the objects and tables defined in [RFC3812] so
   that P2MP MPLS-TE management is an extension of P2P MPLS-TE
   management.

   In addition, this document provides a description of how to use the
   LSR MIB module [RFC3813] to model and control an LSR that supports
   P2MP MPLS-TE.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Feature List

   The feature list for this MIB module is built on the feature list for
   the P2P MPLS-TE MIB module [RFC3812]. The features in the list below
   are marked with a star (*) if they are new features for this MIB
   module and with a circle (o) if they are features satisfied by
   [RFC3812].

   *  The MIB module supports configuration of point-to-multipoint
      unidirectional tunnels.

   o  MPLS tunnels need not be interfaces, but it is possible to
      configure a tunnel as an interface.

   o  The MIB module supports tunnel establishment via an MPLS
      signaling protocol wherein the tunnel parameters are specified
      using this MIB module at the head end of the LSP, and end-to-end
      tunnel LSP establishment is accomplished via signaling.  The MIB
      module also supports manually configured tunnels, i.e., those for
      which label associations at each hop of the tunnel LSP are
      provisioned by the administrator via the LSR MIB [RFC3813].

Internet Draft     draft-farrel-mpls-p2mp-te-mib-00.txt         May 2006

   o  The MIB module supports persistent, as well as non-persistent
      tunnels.

4.  Outline

   P2MP MPLS-TE requires that MPLS tunnels are established from a single
   source point (the root) to one or more destination points (the
   leaves).

   Associated with the MPLS tunnel is a set of configured parameters
   that describe the forwarding behavior of each LSR along the path of
   the label switched paths (LSPs) that support the tunnel. It should
   be noted that, according to [RFC4461] these configuration parameters
   are invariant across the branches of a P2MP LSP towards different
   leaves.

   One of the configuration parameters associated with an MPLS tunnel is
   the path (or route) that supporting LSPs are required to follow. This
   can be specified as a series of loose or strict hops. In P2MP TE,
   this specification of the LSP route includes implicit or explicit
   identification of the branch points in the P2MP LSPs.

   The setup of P2MP tunnels can be achieved as:
   - management actions only, by using [RFC3813]
   - control plane actions under the direction of management by using
     [RFC3812] and the MIB module defined in this document
   - control plane actions under the direction of some other management
     process, monitored using [RFC3812] and the MIB module defined in
     this document.

   Note that [GMPLS-TE-MIB] defines a MIB module that can be used to
   manage and model Generalized MPLS (GMPL) LSPs - it is a series of MIB
   objects and tables some of which extend tables in MPLS-TE-STD-MIB
   [RFC3812]. [RFC4461] and [P2MP-TE] are clear that they apply to
   MPLS-TE [RFC3031] and GMPLS [RFC3945]. This document describes a MIB
   module that can be used for both MPLS-TE and GMPLS P2MP LSPs.

   The following section describes the components of the P2MP MPLS-TE
   MIB module. The subsequent section provides an explanation and
   example of how the P2MP MPLS-TE MIB module can be used for the
   processes listed above in combination with the MPLS-TE MIB module
   defined in [RFC3812]. A further section describes how P2MP tunnels
   can be managed solely through the LSR MIB module defined in
   [RFC3813], and gives an example.

4.1.  Summary of the P2MP MPLS Traffic Engineering MIB Module

   The MIB module consists of the following objects and tables:

   - P2MP Tunnel table (mplsP2mpTunnelTable) that sparse augments the
     MPLS-TE Tunnel table (mplsTunnelTable) and is used to set up and
     monitor P2MP MPLS-TE tunnels.

   - P2MP Tunnel Destination table (mplsP2mpTunnelDestTable) that
     lists the destinations (leaves) of each P2MP MPLS-TE tunnel,
     provides the status of the tunnel to each destination, and
     supplies pointers into the configured hop table, actual route hop
     table, and computed hop table (mplsTunnelHopTable,
     mplsTunnelARHopTable, and mplsTunnelCHopTable) for the routes to
     each of the destinations.

   These tables are described in the following sections after a
   description of how the MPLS-TE-STD-MIB module [RFC3812] is used as a
   basis for MIB management and modeling of P2MP MPLS-TE.

4.2.  Use of MPLS-TE-STD-MIB

   The MIB module defined in this document builds on the objects and
   tables of MPLS-TE-STD-MIB defined in [RFC3812]. That is, most of the
   basic properties of the MPLS tunnel are modeled and managed by
   objects in MPLS-TE-STD-MIB, and new objects are only defined within
   this document where additional features or different behavior is
   required.

   When an MPLS-TE tunnel is a P2MP tunnel, certain objects in the
   mplsTunnelTable are have new meanings just as the signaling objects
   in RSVP-TE [RFC3209] have different meanings when the signaling
   messages are used to establish P2MP LSPs [P2MP-TE].

   As indicated in the next section, the presence of the
   mplsP2mpTunnelTable of the MIB module defined in this document with
   the object mplsTeP2mpTunnel containing the value True (1) shows that
   a tunnel defined in the mplsTunnelTable of MPLS-TE-STD-MIB is a P2MP
   tunnel. Under those circumstances the following objects from
   MPLS-TE-STD-MIB MUST be interpreted as follows. The text below is
   supplementary for the Description clauses in [RFC3812].

   mplsTunnelMaxHops

     This object continues to refer to the maximum number of hops that
     can be configured to a single destination for a tunnel on this
     device. Thus, for a P2MP tunnel, this refers to the maximum number
     of hops that can be configured on this device to any individual
     destination of the tunnel.


Farrel, Yasukawa & Nadeau                                       [Page 5]

Internet Draft     draft-farrel-mpls-p2mp-te-mib-00.txt         May 2006

     A new object, mplsP2mpTunnelTotalMaxHops, is defined in this MIB
     module to supply the total number of hops across all destinations
     of a P2MP tunnel.

   mplsTunnelEgressLSRId

      This object continues to map to the field in the RSVP-TE Session
      Object that occupies the space used by the IPv4 Tunnel Endpoint
      Address [RFC3209], but for a P2MP tunnel, this object does not
      identify an address of the egress of the tunnel. Instead it
      contains the P2MP ID value that identifies the identifier of the
      set of destinations for the P2MP tunnel and is carried in the P2MP
      Session Object [P2MP-TE]. The Description clause for this object
      can be read as follows.

         "Identity of the egress LSR associated with this
          tunnel instance.

          When an entry in the mplsP2mpTunnelTable is present
          corresponding to this entry in the mplsTunnelTable and when
          the mplsTeP2mpTunnel object in that table entry is present
          with the value True(1), this object contains the P2MP ID that
          identifies the set of destinations of this tunnel and that is
          signaled in the P2MP ID field of the P2MP Session Object if
          the MPLS signaling protocol for this tunnel indicated by
          mplsTunnelSignallingProto in MPLS-TE-STD-MIB is rsvp (2)."

      The destinations of the P2MP tunnel are found in the new
      mplsP2mpTunnelDestTable.

   mplsTunnelHopTableIndex

      If the tunnel is a P2MP tunnel as indicated by the presence of an
      entry in the mplsP2mpTunnelTable corresponding to this tunnel and
      when the mplsTeP2mpTunnel object in that table entry is present
      with the value True (1), this object is not used. This is because
      the destinations and paths to those destinations are found in the
      mplsP2mpTunnelDestTable.

      If this object is present for a P2MP tunnel, it should contain the
      value 0.

   mplsTunnelPathInUse

      If the tunnel is a P2MP tunnel as indicated by the presence of an
      entry in the mplsP2mpTunnelTable corresponding to this tunnel and
      when the mplsTeP2mpTunnel object in that table entry is present
      with the value True(1), this object is not used. This is because
      the destinations and paths to those destinations are found in the
      mplsP2mpTunnelDestTable.

Farrel, Yasukawa & Nadeau                                       [Page 6]

Internet Draft     draft-farrel-mpls-p2mp-te-mib-00.txt         May 2006

      If this object is present for a P2MP tunnel, it should contain the
      value 0.

   mplsTunnelARHopTableIndex

      If the tunnel is a P2MP tunnel as indicated by the presence of an
      entry in the mplsP2mpTunnelTable corresponding to this tunnel and
      when the mplsTeP2mpTunnel object in that table entry is present
      with the value True(1), this object is not used. This is because
      the destinations and paths to those destinations are found in the
      mplsP2mpTunnelDestTable.

      If this object is present for a P2MP tunnel, it should contain the
      value 0.

   mplsTunnelCHopTableIndex

      If the tunnel is a P2MP tunnel as indicated by the presence of an
      entry in the mplsP2mpTunnelTable corresponding to this tunnel and
      when the mplsTeP2mpTunnel object in that table entry is present
      with the value True(1), this object is not used. This is because
      the destinations and paths to those destinations are found in the
      mplsP2mpTunnelDestTable.

      If this object is present for a P2MP tunnel, it should contain the
      value 0.

4.3.  mplsP2mpTunnelTable

   The mplsP2mpTunnelTable extends (through a sparse augmentation) the
   MPLS Tunnel table (mplsTunnelTable) from MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812] to
   allow P2MP MPLS-TE tunnels to be created, controlled and monitored at
   any LSR in the network.

   A P2MP MPLS-TE tunnel may be represented in the MIB, by defining it
   in the mplsTunnelTable and providing objects in this table to
   indicate that it is a P2MP tunnel and to define P2MP-specific
   properties of this tunnel.

4.4.  mplsP2mpTunnelDestTable

   P2MP LSPs have multiple destinations and, although the LSP parameters
   (such as bandwidth) for each destination are the same, the explicit
   route requested, computed, and signaled is different for each
   destination. The mplsP2mpTunnelDestTable encodes each destination
   and the information specific to the LSP to that destination.

4.5.  mplsP2mpTunnelBranchPerfTable

TBD

6.  Managing P2MP MPLS-TE LSPs Through the LSR MIB Module

   The nature of P2MP tunnels is such that an LSR that is crossed by a
   tunnel may either be the ingress of that tunnel or have precisely one
   upstream LSP segment (also known as in-segment [RFC3812]) for that
   LSP. On the other hand, any LSR that is crossed by a tunnel may be an
   egress for that tunnel, have one or more downstream segments (also
   known as out-segments [RFC3812]) for that tunnel, or be both an
   egress and have one or more out-segments. Thus, for an LSP at an LSR
   there may be zero or one in-segments, and zero, one, or more than one
   out-segments.

   In-segments, out-segments and their relationship through
   cross-connections are modeled and managed in the MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB
   module [RFC3813]. The mplsInSegmentTable contains in-segments, and
   the mplsOutSegmentTable contains out-segments. The mplsXCTable
   maintains the relationships between in- and out-segments such that
   any many-to-many relationship is allowed. Each segment points into
   the mplsXCTable using mplsInSegmentXCIndex and mplsOutSegmentXCIndex.
   The mplsXCTable contains a series of entries indexed by the primary
   mplsXCIndex object and subsidiary indexes mplsXCInSegmentIndex and
   mplsXCOutSegmentIndex.

   A single P2MP cross-connect has zero or one in-segment. At the
   ingress LSR, there is no in-segment and mplsXCInSegmentIndex is set
   to the single octet 0x00. At transit LSRs, there is exactly one
   in-segment and mplsXCInSegmentIndex is set to the value of
   mplsInSegmentIndex for the in-segment as it appears in the
   mplsInSegmentTable.

   A single P2MP cross-connect has zero, one or many out-segments. If
   there is no out-segment (the cross-connect is on an egress LSR),
   there is one entry in the mplsXCTable indexed by mplsXCIndex set to
   mplsInSegmentXCIndex from the in-segment's entry in
   mplsInSegmentTable, mplsXCInSegmentIndex set to the value of
   mplsInSegmentIndex that identifies the in-segment in
   mplsInSegmentTable, and mplsXCOutSegmentIndex set to the single octet
   0x00. This behavior is exactly as described in [RFC3813].

   If there is exactly one out-segment (the cross-connect is on a
   transit LSR) then the behavior is also exactly as described in
   [RFC3813], and as well as the in-segment objects described in the

Farrel, Yasukawa & Nadeau                                       [Page 8]

Internet Draft     draft-farrel-mpls-p2mp-te-mib-00.txt         May 2006

   previous paragraph, mplsXCOutSegmentIndex is set to the value of
   mplsOutSegmentIndex that identifies the out-segment in
   mplsOutSegmentTable. Note that mplsInSegmentXCIndex and
   mplsOutSegmentXCIndex from the relevant table entries will have the
   same value which will provide the value of mplsXCIndex for the
   cross-connect.

   If there is more than one out-segment then there is one entry in
   mplsXCTable table for each out-segment. The value of mplsXCIndex is
   consistent across all of these table entries, and the in-segment
   index (mplsXCInSegmentIndex) is also consistent identifying the
   single in-segment or (on the ingress LSR) containing the single octet
   0x00. Each of these mplsXCTable entries contains a different
   mplsXCOutSegmentIndex value so that the table can easily be walked to
   find all of the out-segments for the same cross-connect.

   Finally, if an LSR is an egress as well as a transit or branch for
   the P2MP LSP (we call this a bud LSR), mplsXCTable contains the
   entries described above in combination. That is, one entry will have
   mplsXCOutSegmentIndex set to the single octet 0x00, and other entries
   with the same value of mplsXCIndex and mplsXCInSegmentIndex will
   exist for each out-segment.

6.1.  Example Use of the LSR MIB Module

   This section demonstrates how the objects in MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB would
   be set for an example P2MP LSP cross-connect. The information here
   does not show how and in what order these objects should be set to
   create the cross-connect, but shows what information would be read if
   the tables were examined.

   The figure shows the LSP at the LSR that is being examined. There are
   three interfaces to LSR X: 10, 21 and 22. The LSP enters through
   interface 10 using label 7, and exits through interfaces 21 and 22
   using labels 8 and 9 respectively. Let us assume that LSR X is also
   an egress for the LSP.

8.  Security Considerations

   It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for the
   monitoring of P2MP MPLS TE tunnels. This MIB module can also be used
   for the configuration of certain objects, and anything that can be
   configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially disastrous
   results.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations. These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   - The mplsP2mpTunnelTable and mplsP2mpTunnelDestTable contain
     objects that can be used to provision P2MP MPLS tunnels, the
     destinations of those tunnels, and the hops that those tunnels take
     through the network. Unauthorized access to objects in these tables
     could result in disruption of traffic in the network. This is
     especially true if a tunnel has already been established.

     The use of stronger mechanisms, such as SNMPv3 security, should be
     considered where possible. Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST
     be used with any v3 agent which implements this MIB module.
     Administrators SHOULD also consider whether read access to these
     objects is allowed, since read access may be undesirable under
     certain circumstances as described below.

   - The use of this MIB module depends on the use of certain objects
     within MPLS-TE-STD-MIB defined in [RFC3812]. Note that those
     objects are also subject to the same security considerations, and
     any vulnerability to those objects could compromise the P2MP MPLS
     tunnels and/or data in the network. The security section of
     [RFC3812] MUST be applied in conjunction with this security
     seciton.

   - This MIB module does not depend on MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB, but may be
     used in conjunction with that MIB module. If MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB is
     implemented on an LSR, then access to its objects can compromise
     any P2MP MPLS tunnels that start or end on, or transit the LSR.
     MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB is defined in [RFC3813] which has its own security
     section that MUST be applied in conjunction with this security
     section if both MIB modules are supported.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects, and possibly

Farrel, Yasukawa & Nadeau                                      [Page 31]

Internet Draft     draft-farrel-mpls-p2mp-te-mib-00.txt         May 2006

   even to encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   - The mplsP2mpTunnelTable, mplsP2mpTunnelDestTable, and
     mplsP2mpTunnelBranchPerfTable collectively show information about
     the P2MP MPLS tunnel, its route through the network, and its
     performance characteristics. Knowledge of this information could be
     used to compromise the network, or simply to breach
     confidentiality. If an Administrator does not want to reveal this
     information, these tables should be considered
     sensitive/vulnerable.

   - The objects in MPLS-TE-STD-MIB also provide information about the
     P2MP MPLS tunnels defined in this MIB module. If an Administrator
     does not want to reveal this information, the security section of
     [RFC3812] should be applied.

   - The objects in MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB, if implemented, may also provide
     information about the P2MP MPLS tunnels present at an LSR,
     especially the label swapping and cross-connect operations. If an
     Administrator does not want to reveal this information, the
     security section of [RFC3813] should be applied.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED that SNMPv3 be deployed and
   cryptographic security enabled. It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   only those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to those
   objects.

10.  IANA Considerations

   As requested in MPLS-TC-STD-MIB [RFC3811], MPLS-related standards
   track MIB modules should be rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree.

   There is one new MPLS MIB module contained in this document, and the
   following "IANA Considerations" subsection requests IANA for a new
   assignment under the mplsStdMIB subtree.

   New assignments can only be made via a Standards Action as specified
   in [RFC2434].

10.1.  IANA Considerations for MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB

   IANA is requested to assign an oid under the mplsStdMIB subtree to
   the MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB module specified in this document.

-- RFC Editor. Please see the marker YYY in this document and replace it
-- with the value assigned by IANA.
-- Please remove this note.
