Abstract

   This memo defines, using the MIB format, the data model for
   intrusion event correlation. In particular, it defines how the
   relationship among low-level and high-level events can be
   represented, and how this information model can be extended to
   support different type of intrusion detection and security
   management applications.

1.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of five
   major components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
        called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC
        1904 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
        called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
        The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
        described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
        and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
        [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

2.  Problems addressed and goals

   The emergence of collaborated attacks in recent years requires IDS
   technology to move ahead to a new frontier, where different IDSs

Wu, Zhao, Yuill, Chen, Erlanger, Huang, Gong, Wang                 [page 2]

INTERNET-DRAFT          IDS Event Correlation           October 21, 1999

   work in a distributed and cooperated fashion.  Basically they need
   talk to others and talk in a same 'language', which should be in a
   common format and unambiguous, as well as has enough descriptive
   power.  For practical reason, it should be easily implemented and
   involves little overheads.

   A few internet drafts [???] have been proposed to represent the
   data format for intrusion information/events. And, a few commercial
   products such as ISS's RealSecure provide an interface to access
   and interact with intrusion detection information and systems. A
   typical example is the interaction between RealSecure and
   Checkpoint firewall using "opsec."

   However, none of the current works addressed the issue of
   correlation among events in different levels of abstraction. For
   instance, when the IDS detected a portscan attack, how detailed
   should IDS report to the security manager? How does the manager
   find out whether it is a slow portscan or how many machines or IP
   addresses (please note that some of the "ghost" addresses might
   have been scanned) have been scanned and in what rate?

   For another example, when an IDS detected a SynFlood attack, how
   will it report the details if the security manager is interested in
   knowing: how many SynFlood packets? how long? How about source IP
   addresses -- are they the same or random? If random, what are they?

   What we have today is a set of non-structure events, and their
   relationship is not uniformally represented. Our objective in this
   proposal is to define a structure to relate low-level and
   high-level events as well as a framework to extend new relations.

3.  MIB design

   In the real world, people often describe an event with a tuple of
   five elements: <WHERE, WHEN, WHO, WHAT, HOW>.  Borrowed from this
   idea, our MIB also use the same tuple to describe the attacks in
   the cyberspace.  Our MIB organizes the information of an event into
   these five categories.  'WHERE' contains the information on where
   an attack is launched, where is the target and where this event is
   observed.  'WHEN' is a timestamp of a event, which specifies the
   beginning time, ending time of an event and/or the informaiton of
   frequency or times of occurrences.  'WHO' will indicate which IDS
   observed the event and, if possible, which user and/or process
   triggered it.  'WHAT' records the detailed information, such as
   protocol type, protocol-specific data, and packet content.  The
   links between abstract events and raw events specify 'HOW', which
   we will explain in the following.

   Most of currently developed or developing IDSs fall into two
   categories: signature-based IDS and statistic-based IDS.
   Signature-based IDSs use signature recognition approach to detect
   intrusions, which can be implemented, for example, by finite state
   machines. Under this approach, a set of low level "raw" events will

Wu, Zhao, Yuill, Chen, Erlanger, Huang, Gong, Wang                 [page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT          IDS Event Correlation           October 21, 1999

   trigger the state transitions. When such a finite state machine
   stopped in a particular critical state, a particular intrusion has
   been detected and thus a high level abstract event is generated.
   Statistic-based IDSs use statistical approach which monitors
   deviations from a long-term profile.  A single significant
   deviation can be regarded as a raw event.  When an IDS detects a
   list of deviations and believes an intrusion is in progress, an
   abstract event can be produced. Therefore, in order to represent
   the relations among raw and high-level events, we use another
   table, reference table, to link abstract event with corresponding
   raw events, which specify the 'HOW' as we explained above.

5.  Examples to use IDS Event MIB

   In the following examples, we define 2 special values: if all bits
   are 0, it means no value avaiable for the corresponding field, while all
   bits 1 means any value is possible.

 - Port Scanning attack:

   Port scanning is usually the first step of a real attack, by which
   attackers try to gather information of the victim.  Once they find a
   running service has security hole, they can exploit it and launch an
   attack.

 - User Activity Anomaly Event:

   User Activity Anomaly generally means a user's behavior significantly
   deviated from his normal profile. For example, a user usually just
   uses word processing software, suddenly, he seems begin to use
   compliers more.  That indicates his account maybe has been
   compromised.

Security Considerations

   There are management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
   ACCESS clause of read-write and read-create. There is the risk that
   an intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   via direct SNMP SET operations. So, care must be taken to put in

Wu, Zhao, Yuill, Chen, Erlanger, Huang, Gong, Wang                [page 22]

INTERNET-DRAFT          IDS Event Correlation           October 21, 1999

   place the security provisions of SNMP for authentication and access
   control.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features for such a
   secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET (read) and SET (write) the objects in this MIB.

   It is strongly recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.
