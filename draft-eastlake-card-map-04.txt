Abstract

   There are a variety of servers, web pages, and the like, which
   holders of ISO 7812 financial transaction identification card numbers
   and ISO 7816 smart card or related numbers may need to locate on the
   Internet. For example, some systems assume a smart card holder can
   contact the issuer of a smart card application for maintenance and
   update functions and the SET protocol assumes that a card holder can
   locate the appropriate certification authority to obtain a card
   holder certificate. This document specifies a method using the DNS as
   an important element in locating card related facilities on the
   Internet by mapping ISO 7812 and ISO 7816 based number systems into
   domain names within in the card.reg.int domain.



Disclaimer

   The methods proposed herein are not, at the time of the issuance of
   this document, endorsed by the credit card brands or associations for
   use in connection with SET.

INTERNET-DRAFT                         ISO 7812/7816 Numbers and the DNS


1. Introduction

   Financial transaction cards such as credit and debit cards are
   identified by numbers issued in conjunction with ISO standard 7812
   [ISO 7812-1] and applications that run on ISO smart cards are
   identified by numbers issued in conjunction with ISO standard 7816
   [ISO 7816-5]. In general, the leading digits of such numbers indicate
   the issuing institution and the remainder of the number provides
   further identification.

   There has been no way, given such a number, to automatically find any
   Internet site related to the card issuer, the card brand, or other
   card facilities. For example, the SET protocol [SET] defined by VISA,
   MasterCard, and others, defines a means for cardholders, when
   required, to obtain an X.509 compliant certificates to attest to the
   cardholder's authenticity but does not specify how to locate the
   appropriate certification authority.  Some operations in connections
   with smart card resident applications, such as resetting certain
   error conditions on an Mondex stored value card, may require
   contacting the issuer. Other protocols may require that other
   facilities based on card number be reached over the Internet.

   A means of automatically mapping such identification numbers into
   domain names means that as soon as a number is known (due to user
   smart card insertion or user selection from a list of previous
   entered credit cards, for example), the ability would be present to
   easily attempt to contact facilities on the Internet for that number.
   Thus web browsers/wallets could provide "go to issuer", "go to
   brand", "get a SET certificate",  etc., buttons whenever an IS0
   7812/7816 identification number is known.



1.1 ISO 7812 Details

   Under ISO 7812, card numbers are decimal and the first 6 digits are
   formally known as the Issuer Identification Number or IIN.  This
   prefix is sometimes referred to as the BIN (Bank Identification
   Number), although it applies to more than banks, and the entire
   number is somtimes known as the PAN (Primary Account Number), even
   though these numbers are also used for secondary accounts, Merchant
   accounts, and other account and identification numbers. Card numbers
   are frequently issued in connection with "brands" such as VISA,
   MasterCard, American Express, JCB, Discover, Dinners Club, Air Travel
   Card, etc.

   Formally, ISO 7812 identification card numbers are divided as
   follows:

           7 - petroleum
           8 - telecommunications and other industry assignments
           9 - for national assignment

   If the number starts with 9, the next three digits are the numeric
   country code as defined in ISO 3166 and the remainder of the number
   is as defined by that national standards body for that country.

   Account numbers are variable length up to a maximum of 12 digits.

   The check digit is calculated modulo 10 by the Luhn formula over all
   the preceding digits as specified in ISO 7812.

   The global registration agency for ISO 7812 Issuer Identification
   Numbers is the American Bankers Association (www.aba.com) but
   application for an IIN must generally be made through a national
   standards boday.



1.2 ISO 7816 Details

   ISO smart cards have applications on them each identified by a
   hexidecimal Application Identifier (AID) BCD encoded into a maximum
   of 16 bytes.  In the past, many such cards have had a single
   application but multiapplication cards are expected to be more common
   in the future.

   The first hex digit of the AID indicates the type of AID prefix as
   listed below followed by details on each type.  In general, the AID
   prefix is followed a variable length "Proprietary application
   identification extenstion" (PIX) under the control of the issuer
   identified by the prefix.

   0-9  An ISO 7812 IIN.

   E    Reserved for ISO.
   F    Proprietary non-registered



1.2.1 ISO 7816 '0'-'9' Prefixes

   AIDs with a prefix of '0' through '9' use ISO 7812 IINs for the
   prefix (see section 1.1 above).

      +-------------------------+--------+----------------------------+
      |         ISO 7812        |        | Proprietary application    |

      +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   ISO 7816 is designed to be indpendent of IIN length and specifies
   that if the IIN length is odd, it should be padded up the next full
   byte by suffixing  a hex 'F' nibble.



1.2.2 ISO 7816 'A' Prefixes

   AIDs with a prefix of 'A' (i.e., binary 1010) followed by 36 bits or
   Registry provider number as 9 BCD digits.  Values in these 9 nibbles
   not corresponding to a decimal digits are reserved for ISO.

1.2.3 ISO 7816 'D' Prefixes

   The RID consists of the 4 bit D prefix (binary 1101), the country
   code in 12 bits as 3 BCD digits coded according to the numeric
   country codes in ISO 3166, and 24 additional bits as specified by the
   national standards body with BCD coding recommended.

1.2.4 ISO 7816 'B', 'C', 'E', and 'F' Prefixes

   Prefixes 'B', 'C', and 'E' are reserved for future use by ISO and not
   further specified.

   Prefix 'F' indicates a proprietary non-registered AID.  Because of
   this, the same 'F' prefixed AID could be used by different
   application providers.

2. Inverse Number Mapping and Wildcards

   When numbers are allocated in lexically hierarchical blocks so that a
   prefix or suffix of digits is a meaningful division, the DNS wildcard
   feature can be used to provide a convenient delgation and lookup
   mechanism.  This works even when the numbers and prefixes/suffixes
   are variable length. In this regard, it is important to remember that
   more specific names override less specific ones for DNS wildcards.

   Domain names start with the most significant label on the right and
   go to less significant labels as you go left while in ISO 7812 and
   7816 numbers the leading or left most digits are the most significant
   while the trailing or right most digits are less significant.  Thus,
   the digits must be reversed to match the card number and DNS naming
   systems and the digits must be interspersed with dots to provide
   hierarchical division into DNS domains.

   Note that the transformed, reversed number need not be exposed to
   users but could be generated internally by software in an automatic
   fashion.

   For example, currently the American Express card brand is the only
   one using numbers starting with 37.  However, this is not a guarantee
   for all time and it could be that at some point BIN numbers starting
   with 37 would be assigned to a different brand. If you are looking up
   facility "z" for card number 37012345678 (not a valid American
   Express number), you could do a retrieval with a name like
   3.2.1.0.7.3.z.card.reg.int. A wild card RR with the name
   *.7.3.z.card.reg.int would match this and would appear in the
   response with its name expanded to the specific name asked for, but
   only if there were no more specific name.  If there were a
   3.2.1.0.7.3.z.card.reg.int specific name, for instance, it would
   always be chosen in preference to the *.7.3.xz wildcard in this case
   because it is a more exact match. On the other hand, if a retrieval
   were done for 7.7.7.7.7.3.z.card.reg.int, it would get the more
   general *.7.3.z.card.reg.int wild card since it does not match the
   more exact wildcard.  (The situation is generally somewhat more
   complex than indicted here because additional intermediate length
   wildcards may be needed.  See the Appendix for a more complete
   example zone.)

3. Card Domain Names Specified

   Subdomains are currently defined within the card.reg.int domain as
   follows in alphabetic order:

      acquirer.card.reg.int - ISO 7812 card acquirers
      aid.card.reg.int      - ISO 7816 application identifiers
      brand.card.reg.int.   - ISO 7812 card brands.
      issuer.card.reg.int.  - ISO 7812 card issuers.
      mondex.card.reg.int.  - Mondex smart card facilities by PID.
      set-ca.card.reg.int.  - ISO 7812 SET Certification Authorities.

   To find a facility, you need to (1) get the number, (2) reverse the
   order of these digits, and (3) put a dot between each digit and add
   the appropriate facility suffix as shown below.  ISO 7812 financial
   transaction card identification numbers MUST be truncated to avoid
   revealing the full number in the DNS queries but this does not
   generally apply to ISO 7816 AIDs.

   None of the facility pointers obtained via these means need be
   exclusive and these card related Internet facilities may have other
   names and URLs that will also work.  These facilities are intended to
   supplement, not necesarily replace, direct communication of domain
   names and URLs from financial institutions to their customers.



3.1 ISO 7812 Card Brand and Issuer Acquirer Pointers

   The card brand and issuer home pages can be located by creating the
   numeric portion as above and appending ".brand.card.reg.int" or
   ".issuer.card.reg.int" respectively.  A CNAME RR will be stored at
   that name pointing to the actual domain name for the home page.  A
   CNAME is chosen, rather than having specific "A" RRs pointing to
   host(s), "MX" RRs pointing to mail servers, etc., to minimize the
   update load on the card.reg.int domain.  Changes in the serving host,
   mail servers, etc., need only be made under the facility's domain
   name, which the CNAME points to, rather than also under card.reg.int.

   For example, the brand for the card 551204..., a MasterCard card, can
   be found by browsing at 4.0.2.1.5.5.brand.card.reg.int. and the
   issuer for the card 471922..., a VISA card, can be found by browsing
   at 2.2.9.1.7.4.issuer.reg.card.int.  These domain names can be
   automatically generated from a card number and need not be exposed to
   ordinary users.

   The Appendix shows possible initial content of the brand.card.reg.int
   domain.  There are relatively few brands and they are allocated to
   moderately compact blocks of numbers with relatively few exceptions
   not belonging to the block brand. So there will probably be under


Donald E. Eastlake 3rd                                          [Page 9]


INTERNET-DRAFT                         ISO 7812/7816 Numbers and the DNS


   2,000 entries in the brand.card.reg.int subdomain.

   Since there are only a few tens of thousands of banks and other
   issuers of significance in the world for financial transaction cards,
   there should be well under 200,000 entries in the issuer.card.reg.int
   subdomain.

   Although at this time very large blocks of numbers are generally
   allocated to brands (for example almost all card numbers starting
   with 5 and 4 are MasterCard and Visa cards, respectively), some
   numbers within these large blocks may be carved out by more specific
   entries for other brands.



3.2 ISO 7812 Acquirer Facilities

   Generally, merchants are assigned merchant IDs from the space of PANs
   by their acquirer.  Acquirer facilities can be located from such
   numbers using the .acquirer.card.reg.int suffix.



3.3 ISO 7812 SET Certification Authority Pointers

   A very high level description of the cardholder certificate issuance
   procedure in SET [SET] is for a cardholderCInitRequest initialization
   message to be sent to the CA, an initialization response received,
   then a registrationFormRequest is sent to the CA and a either
   registration form returned which the user fills in or a referral to
   another CA is returned.  The completed registration form is submitted
   in a certificateRequest message to which there is a response which
   can include the certificate or indicate it will be issued later or
   indicate a failure.

   The above sequence can occur over a variety of transports [SET-EIG]
   including TCP and HTTP.  TCP would be to the SET well known port 257,
   unless some other port was mutually agreed on, but cardholder to CA
   communication is normally expected to be HTTP.  In HTTP, the sequence
   is usually preceded by a kick-off message from the CA which is of
   MIME type Application/SET-Registration-Initiation which activates a
   SET wallet.

   In some cases, cardholders will be given SET certificaiton Authority
   URLs in mailings from the card issuer or on their card itself.
   However, there will be other cases, such as older cards that have not
   had a CA URL added or a card for which the URL has changed due to
   bank mergers or splits or DNS changes.  Furthermore, in certification
   authority interaction, the user will be required to supply their full
   account number in any case and the requirement that they also


Donald E. Eastlake 3rd                                         [Page 10]


INTERNET-DRAFT                         ISO 7812/7816 Numbers and the DNS


   manually enter a URL means additional effort and opportunity for
   error. Note also that ISO 7812 account numbers have a built in check
   digit to catch most typographical errors while URLs do not.  Thus the
   ability to automatically determine a SET CA URL form a card number
   would be very helpful.

   There are three pointers provided in connection with CAs, one for the
   CA general web page for browsing, one derived URL that can be hit to
   produce the SET certificate issuance kick-off message, and a derived
   URL that can be used to post the initial cardholderCInitRequest if a
   kick-off cycle is not needed.

   The certification authority home page can be found as described in
   3.1 above for brands and issuers, except that the suffix is

       ".set-ca.card.reg.int".

   A CNAME will also be used in this subdomain.  At this time it is not
   clear in how many cases a certification authority will correspond to
   a single BIN, to a brand, to blocks of BINs, or even to part of a BIN
   (see section 3.4).  Note that the wild card mechanism can easily
   accommodate arrangements such as a default certification authority
   for a brand with specific CAs for some BINs within that brand.

   To determine the URLs to hit for the SET certificate issuance wake up
   message [SET-EIG], take the CA domain name as above, prefix it with
   "http://", and suffix it with "/SET-Registration-Initiation".  For
   some purposes, the wake up message may not be necessary.  In that
   case, the cardholderCInitRequest SET message [SET] can be POSTed
   directly to a similar URL but with the suffix of
   /cardholderCInitRequest.

       Suffix to Domain Name            Action

      /SET-Registration-Initiation     Certificate Request Wakeup
      /cardholderCInitRequest          SET msg to start cert. req.

   Note that no explicit DNS retrieval is necessary.  In initiating a
   cardholder certificate application for card number 8765432109, you
   mechanically transform the number into a URL and go.  In this case
   that would be, to start with a kick-off,

      <http://3.4.5.6.7.8.set-ca.card.int/SET-Registration-Initiation>.



3.4 ICON Location

   For many of the facilities locatable via card.reg.int, some user
   interface software will want to be able to display an image or icon.

INTERNET-DRAFT                         ISO 7812/7816 Numbers and the DNS


   Standard suffixes to the computed domain name of the facility are
   recommended, as listed below, to make the default location of such
   icons easier.

       Suffix to Domain Name            Image Size in Pixels

      /icons/exsmall.gif               32 x 32  or  32 x 20
      /icons/small.gif                 53 x 33
      /icons/medium.gif                103 x 65
      /icons/large.gif                 180 x 114
      /icons/exlarge.gif               263 x 166

   The larger dimension above is horizontal and the smaller is vertical.
   The extra small version is permitted to be a 32x32 square which is a
   common desk top operating system icon size.  It is recommended that
   the extra small size be avoided due to lower recognizability is such
   small images.  The color palette of the icons should be limited to
   colors typically available in an 8 bit or 256 color environment.

   The above file name, size, and color recommendations are similar to
   those in Book 2 of the SET standards [SET].



3.5 Mondex Purse IDs

   The Mondex smart card payment system uses purse IDs on its cards
   which have the same format as PANs.  mondex.card.reg.int is allocated
   for possible used in finding facilities relavent to such cards.



3.6 ISO 7816 Application IDs

   Facilties based on ISO 7816 application identifiers can be found
   using the


   prefix.  While a subset of such IDs are structured like ISO 7812
   PANs, nevertheless, they are likely to need different facilities so
   no reference is made to the parts of the card.reg.int DNS tree
   allocated for non-smart card use.



3.7 Financial Institutions Not On Line

   Some numbers are allocated to institutions that do not have a network
   presence. In some of those cases, a wildcard will provide an
   appropriate pointer, say to a brand supplied bank lookup page that


Donald E. Eastlake 3rd                                         [Page 12]


INTERNET-DRAFT                         ISO 7812/7816 Numbers and the DNS


   provides telephone number and address or the like to contact the
   bank.  However, in cases where the next higher level wildcard would
   provide inappropriate pointers for such institutions, it will be
   necessary in some cases to add entries for such numbers which are
   CNAMEed to "not-on-line.card.reg.int" which will not exist.  Thus an
   appropriate error message will be generated.



3.8 ISO 7812 BIN Ambiguity

   For the facilities under card.reg.int using ISO 7812 numbers, the BIN
   is defined as the first six digits of the account number.  In many
   cases an issuer or certification authority is defined by fewer
   digits, frequently the first four digits.  This is no problem as a
   wild card can be used to match all extensions of this shorter prefix.
   However, cases where six digits are insufficient need special
   handling as describe below.  Such situations can arise due to
   subdivision / subdelegation of a BIN for administrative reasons, due
   to sale of part of a card population, as parts of bank mergers and
   splits, etc.  Additional digits can not be used in the DNS because
   they would reveal too much of the card number.



3.8.1 Ambiguos BIN Web Page Access

   If multiple institutions have decided to share a BIN, there are
   several ways the situation can be handled.  For the issuer web page
   either (1) the insitutions sharing the BIN can run a common web page
   with links to their individual pages on it or (2) if they are all the
   same brand, the brand can run such a multi-issuer referral page at
   the BIN or, in many cases, at a higher level wildcard or (3) in the
   event that they are different brands, the card.reg.int maintenance
   agency can run a page providing access to the different sub-BIN
   issuers.  A multiple issuer home page could just have names, icons,
   and links to the separate institutions or more complex indexing or
   search facilities if it covered many banks.  While this problem in
   not expected to arise for the brand.card.reg.int subdomain, similar
   solutions apply if it does.



3.8.2 Ambiguous BIN SET CA Access

   In the cases where a URL is derived to access SET certification
   authority facilities, and the BIN is ambiguous, a more automated
   solution is available.  In particular, instead of a human looking at
   a web page, we usuallyy have an application trying to get a
   cardholder certificate.  In SET, when the registration process

   reaches the point of sending the CA a registration form request, that
   request is accompanied (securely) by the full account number. The
   registration form response that is returned can have, instead of a
   registration form, a referral to a different URL.  Thus, the
   "certification authority" could be simply a secure referral program
   that uses as much of the identification number as it wishes, quite
   possibly more than the fist six digits, to determine where to forward
   the cardholder application.

4. Security Considerations

   This document concerns a means to map ISO 7812 financial card and ISO
   7816 smart card application identification numbers into the Domain
   Name System (DNS) so that card related facilities on the Internet can
   be automatically located.  The security of the resulting pointers is
   dependent on the integrity of the card.reg.int maintenance agency and
   the security of the DNS, including the use of security extensions
   [RFC 2065].  However, note that when used in connection with most
   smart card application schemes and with SET certificate issuance, the
   security mechanisms of the protocols used after communications is
   established provide strong protection against spoofing or compromise
   of sensitive information even if the DNS were subverted.

   For currently existing types of ISO 7812 financial numbers care
   should be taken in making DNS queries that an entire sensitive
   identification number is NOT used.  Since DNS queries are not
   encrypted, this would expose the card number within the Internet. No
   more than the initial six digits should be used.  (These
   considerations do not generally apply to numbers based on ISO 7816
   application identifiers.)

   numbers starting with a 5 are enetered into the DNS zone, there is no
   reason to go to any more detail in the wildcard.)
