Abstract

   Sometimes it is necessary to discover the Start of Authority points
   in the DNS, otherwise known as zone cuts, without causing negative
   entries to be recorded in caches.  This document describes how to
   achieve this.

1.  Introduction

   When performing a DNS UPDATE RFC 2136 [RFC2136] it is necessary to
   send the request to the nameservers for the zone.  Often, however,
   all you have is the name of the record to be updated.  From this you
   need to discover the zone and the authoritative nameservers to which
   the DNS UPDATE request should be addressed to.

   One method would be to query for the root nameservers then have the
   client follow the delegation path talking to each set of nameservers
   in turn.  In practice this does not work due to firewalls and because
   not all names in the DNS actually have a delegation path from the
   root.  The later is especially true with split DNS configurations and
   with sites using private addressing RFC 1918 [RFC1918].

   The next method is just to query for the SOA or NS records (both
   being present only at zone cuts) at the query name, removing labels
   until a answer is returned.  This works well if the initial query
   happens to be at a zone cut and reasonably well if the query name
   exists in the DNS.  It does not work well if name does not exist in
   the DNS as the negative cache entry obscures the changes that are
   about to be made.

   This document describes changes to nameserver behaviour which remove
   the undesired side effects of making a SOA query.

1.1.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Why Choose SOA over NS Queries

   As the primary motivation for this was to support UPDATE requests and
   these are supposed to be preferentially directed at the SOA MNAME,
   the SOA query was required.  SOA queries will also usually return the
   corresponding NS RRset in the additional section where as the NS
   query will not return the SOA RRset at zone cuts.

   SOA queries are not part of the normal query mix.  Not negatively
   caching the SOA response is unlikely to have a detrimental impact.

   SOA queries do not interfere with any benefits of caching the NODATA
   response to NS queries made by nameservers performing DNSSEC
   validations RFC 4035, Section 4.2 [RFC4035].

3.  Authoritative Server Behaviour

   When returning a negative answer to a SOA query, the nameserver sets
   the TTL of the SOA record in the authority section of the response to
   zero rather than the SOA MINIMUM as described in RFC 2308 [RFC2308].

   An implementation SHOULD do this by default but MUST allow it to be
   overriden on a per zone basis.  Some zones which are not updateable,
   TLDs in particular, have "unregistered" children which attempt to
   update them.  Returning a negative response with a non-zero TTL can
   reduce the load on the authoritative servers.


4.  Caching Server Behaviour

   When a resolver receives a negative answer to a SOA query it MAY set
   the negative cache TTL to zero.  It MAY also set the TTL of the SOA
   record in the authority section to zero.

   The is useful when the authoritative servers do not follow this
   documents and there are update clients using the cache.


5.  Client Behaviour

   Clients start by issuing a recursive query for a SOA resource record
   at <QNAME,QCLASS>.  If we get one as an answer that matches the
   <SOA,QNAME,QCLASS> tuple we have found the containing zone name.

   If a referral is returned then fail.

   If a CNAME or DNAME is returned in the answer section the QNAME does
   not correspond to a zone name and any SOA record present may not be
   for the desired zone.  The client SHOULD re-query removing the
   leftmost (least significant) label from QNAME.

   If we get a SOA record in the authority section this record should
   refer to the enclosing zone, RFC 2308 [RFC2308].

   If the answer section is empty and there is not SOA record in the
   authority section the client needs to re-query with the leftmost
   label removed.

   If a client performs an UPDATE it should not immediately perform a
   action that depends on the updated data being returned to the
   resolver.  UPDATEs, even when NOTIFY RFC 1996 [RFC1996] is in use,
   take some time to propagate to the authoritative servers.
   Immediately querying for the updated data using a caching server will

   often defeat the steps taken here.

   Polling each of the nameservers for the zone to see if it has the new
   data and waiting if it doesn't should prevent this occurring.  If you
   do this use exponential back-off when polling.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   As with all answers from the DNS, clients need to be aware that
   answers may be spoofed.  It is advised that that clients use DNSSEC,
   TSIG, SIG(0) or some other cryptographic mechanism to detect such
   spoofed responses.
