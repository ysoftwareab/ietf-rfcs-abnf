   Abstract 

   Continuity Check (CC), Proactive Connectivity Verification (CV) and 
   Remote Defect Indication (RDI) functionalities are MPLS-TP OAM 
   requirements listed in [3]. 
    
   Continuity Check monitors the integrity of the continuity of the path 
   for any loss of continuity defect. Connectivity verification monitors 
   the integrity of the routing of the path between sink and source for 
   any connectivity issues. RDI enables an End Point to report, to its 
   associated End Point, a fault or defect condition that it detects on 
   a PW, LSP or Section. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that a protocol solution, meeting one or more 
   functional requirement(s), be the same for PWs, LSPs and Sections as 
   per [3]. 
    
   This document specifies methods for proactive CV, CC, and RDI for 
   MPLS-TP Label Switched Path (LSP), PWs and Sections using 
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD).

1. Introduction 

   In traditional transport networks, circuits are provisioned on 
   multiple switches. Service Providers (SP) need OAM tools to detect 
   mis-connectivity and loss of continuity of transport circuits. MPLS-
   TP LSPs [11] emulating traditional transport circuits need to provide 
   the same CC and proactive CV capabilities as mentioned in [3]. This 
   document describes the use of BFD [7] for CC, proactive CV, and RDI 
   of an MPLS-TP LSP between two Maintenance End Points (MEPs). 

   The mechanism specified in this document is restricted only to BFD 
   asynchronous mode. 

   The proposed method uses BFD state machine defined in Section 6.2 of 
   [7] for bidirectional p2p connections and uses the p2mp BFD state 
   machine defined in [8] for p2p unidirectional and p2mp unidirectional 
   transport path. 

   As described in [4], Continuity Check (CC) and Proactive Connectivity 
   Verification (CV) functions are used to detect loss of continuity 
   (LOC), unintended connectivity between two MEPs (e.g. mismerging or 
   misconnection or unexpected MEP).  

   The Remote Defect Indication (RDI) is an indicator that is 
   transmitted by a MEP to communicate to its peer MEPs that a signal 
   fail condition exists.RDI is only used for bidirectional connections 
   and is associated with proactive CC & CV packet generation. 

   The main goal here is to specify the BFD extension and behaviour to 
   satisfy the CC, proactive CV monitoring and the RDI functionality.

3. MPLS-TP CC, proactive CV and RDI Mechanism using BFD 

   This document proposes two modes of BFD operation  

   o CC mode: uses the existing ACH code point (0x0007) and BFD ACH 
      packet encapsulation (BFD without IP/UDP headers ) as defined in 
      [6]. In this mode Continuity Check and RDI functionalities are 
      supported. 

   o CV/CC mode: defines a new code point in the Associated Channel 
      Header (ACH) described in [2]. Under MPLS label stack of the MPLS-
      TP LSP, the ACH with "MPLS-TP Proactive CV/CC" code point 
      indicates that the message is an MPLS-TP BFD proactive CV and CC 
      message.

   The first nibble (0001b) indicates the ACH. 

   The version and the reserved values are both set to 0 as specified in 
   [2]. 

   MPLS-TP proactive CV/CC code point = 0xHH. [HH to be assigned by IANA 
   from the PW Associated Channel Type registry.] 

   In this mode Continuity Check, Connectivity Verifications and RDI  
   functionalities are supported. 

   Both CC and CV/CC modes apply to PWs, MPLS LSPs (including tandem 
   connection monitoring), and Sections 

   It's possible to run the BFD in CC mode on some transport paths 
   and the BFD in CV/CC mode on other transport paths. In any case, 
   only one tool for OAM instance at time, configurable by 
   operator, can run.

                     Figure 2: MPLS-TP CV/CC Message 
    

   As shown in Figure 2, BFD Control packet as defined in [7] is 
   transmitted as MPLS labeled packets along with ACH, ACH TLV Header 
   defined in Section 3 of RFC 5586 and one ACH TLV object carrying the 
   unique MEP Identifier of the source of the BFD packet defined in [12] 

   When GAL label is used, the TTL field of the GAL MUST be set to at 
   least 1, and the GAL will be the end of stack label. 

3.3. BFD Profile for MPLS-TP 

   BFD MUST run in asynchronous mode as described in [7]. 

   No changes to the BFD state machine defined in [7] for p2p 
   bidirectional transport path and in [8] for unidirectional p2p and 
   p2mp transport path. 

   BFD Control Packets are sent at regular configured time rate. 

   BFD session is declared Down: 

      If an unexpected MEP identifier is received (mis-connectivity 
      defect) 

      If timer and detect multiplier re-negotiation is disabled and an 
      unexpected desired min Tx interval field value or unexpected 
      detect multiplier field are received (Unexpected period defect).  

      If BFD session times out (Loss of Connectivity)

3.3.1. Timer negotiation 

   BFD timer values negotiation is optional and disabled by default on 
   the MPLS-TP transport paths. 

   Active Role is default, passive is optional. 

   The configured BFD packet transmission is carried in the "Desired Min 
   TX Interval field". For a bidirectional p2p transport path the 
   "Required Min RX Interval field" MUST be the same as "Desired Min TX 
   Interval field". The source MEP of an unidirectional p2p and p2mp 
   session MUST set the "Required Min RX Interval field " to 0. 

   The default timer values to be used based on what's recommended in 
   [4]. 

3.3.2. Discriminator values 

   In the BFD control packet the discriminator values have either local 
   or no significance.  

   My discriminator field MUST be set to a nonzero value (it can be a 
   fixed value), the transmitted your discriminator value MUST reflect 
   back the received value of My discriminator field or be set to 0 if 
   that value is not known yet. 

3.4. Remote Detection Indication (RDI) 

   The BFD Diagnostic (Diag) field defined in [8] can be used for this 
   functionality. 

   On MEP mismatch, loss of connectivity or unexpected timer and 
   unexpected detect multiplier a MEP sends to its peer MEP a BFD packet 
   with the Diagnostic (Diag) field value set to 1 (corresponding to the 
   "Control Detection Time Expired"). 

   The value 0 indicates RDI condition has been cleared. 

4. Operation 

   For p2p bidirectional LSPs, both endpoints of the bidirectional MPLS-
   TP LSP MUST send BFD messages in-band in the MPLS-TP LSP using the 
   defined code point. 

   When on a configured bidirectional transport path the proactive CV/CC 
   or CC monitoring is enabled, each MEP sends the BFD Control Packets 
   at the rate of the configured transmission period and each MEP

   expects to receive the BFD packets from its peer MEP at the same rate 
   as per [4]. 

   MPLS labels at both MEPs are used to provide context for the received 
   BFD packets. 

   Active role is the default behavior, passive role is optional. 

   In Active role both MEPs start sending initial BFD Control Packets 
   with the State field set to "Down" value and with "Your 
   discriminator" field set to zero.

                             Figure 3 
    

   o If a MEP-B in Figure 3 detects one of the following faults (miss-
      connectivity, Unexpected Period or loss of continuity) from its 
      peer MEP, it declares that the transport path in its receive 
      direction is down (in other words, MEP-B enters the "receive 
      defect" state for this transport path) and signals it to its peer 
      MEP (MEP-A) sending  the BFD packets with State (Sta) field set to 
      "Down" and Diagnostic code 1 (RDI)  

   o In turn, the peer MEP (MEP-A) declares the transport path is down 
      in its transmit direction, (in other words, MEP-A enters the 
      "transmit defect" state for this transport path) setting the State 
      (Sta field ) to Down with Diagnostic code 3 (Neighbor signaled 
      session down) in its BFD packets towards MEP-B. Please note that 
      if the failure is unidirectional, i.e. only from A to B direction 
      as in Figure 1. MEP-A, transits first to Down State but then to 
      Init state as it still receives BFD packets from its peer MEP B.  

4.1. Unidirectional p2p or p2mp transport path. 

   o In a unidirectional (point-to-point or point-to-multipoint) 
      transport path, where the proactive CV/CC or CC monitoring is 
      enabled, only the Source MEP is enabled to generate BFD packets 
      with frequency of the configured transmission period and always 
      with UP State information. This MEP does not expect to receive any 
      BFD packets from its peer MEP(s), as such all state transitions 
      are administratively driven.

   o A MEP Sink, configured on a unidirectional transport path where 
      the proactive CV and CC monitoring is enabled, expects to receive 
      the BFD packets from its peer MEP at the configured frequency; the 
      defects detection procedure is the same as the bidirectional MEP. 

   Traffic MUST not be affected, when proactive CV/CC or CC monitoring 
   is enabled/disabled by an operator on a configured MEP or when a BFD 
   session transits from one state to another as per [4].

6. IANA Considerations 

   To be added in a later version of this document 

7. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations for the authentication TLV need further 
   study. 

   Base BFD foresees an optional authentication section (see [7] 
   section 6.7); that can be extended even to the tool proposed in 
   this document. 

   Authentication methods that require checksum calculation on the 
   outgoing packet must extend the checksum even on the ME 
   Identifier Section. This is possible but seems uncorrelated with 
   the solution proposed in this document: it could be better to 
   use the simple password authentication method.
