1.  Introduction

   It is the purpose of this document to define managed objects which
   describe the behavior of an SNMP entity, as defined in the SNMP
   architecture [RFC2571].

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework at the time of this writing consists of
   five major components:

        -    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

        -    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for
             the purpose of management.  The first version of this
             Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1
             and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC
             1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 [RFC1215].  The second version,
             called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578],
             STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

        -    Message protocols for transferring management information.
             The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called
             SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A
             second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not
             an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and
             described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901] and RFC -TM [RFC-TM].  The
             third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
             described in RFC -TM [RFC-TM], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC
             2574 [RFC2574].

        -    Protocol operations for accessing management information.
             The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU
             formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A
             second set of protocol operations and associated PDU
             formats is described in RFC -PROTO [RFC-PROTO].

        -    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
             [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism
             described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

        A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management
        Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
        MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

        This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
        A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the
        appropriate translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be
        semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are
        omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
        Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted
        into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation
        process.  However, this loss of machine readable information is
        not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be



SNMPv3 Working Group        Expires June 2000                  [Page 24]

Internet Draft        Protocol Operations for SNMP        9 January 2000


   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change)
   them.
