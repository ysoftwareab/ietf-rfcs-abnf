1 Introduction 
    
   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used for the 
   transmission of real-time or near real-time media data over the 
   Internet.  While it was originally designed to work well for 
   multicast groups in very large scales, its scope is not limited to 
   that.  More and more applications use RTP for small multicast 
   groups (e.g. video conferences) or even unicast (e.g. IP telephony 
   and media streaming applications). 
    
   RTP comes together with its companion protocol Real-time Transport 
   Control Protocol (RTCP), which is used to monitor the transmission 
   of the media data and provide feedback of the reception quality.  
   Furthermore, it can be used for loose session control.  Having the 
   scope of large multicast groups in mind, the rules when to send 
   feedback were carefully restricted to avoid feedback explosion or 
   feedback related congestion in the network.  RTP and RTCP have 
   proven to work well in the Internet, especially in large multicast 
   groups, which is shown by its widespread usage today. 
    
   However the applications that transmit the media data only to 
   small multicast groups or unicast may benefit from more frequent 
   feedback. The source of the packets may be able to react to 
   changes in the reception quality, which may be due to varying

   network utilization (e.g. congestion) or other changes.  Possible 
   reactions include transmission rate adaptation according to a 
   congestion control algorithm or the invocation of error resilience 
   features for the media stream (e.g. retransmissions, reference 
   picture selection, NEWPRED, etc.). 
    
   As mentioned before, more frequent feedback may be desirable to 
   increase the reception quality, but RTP restricts the use of RTCP 
   feedback.  Hence it was decided to create a new extended RTP 
   profile, which redefines some of the RTCP timing rules, but keeps 
   most of the algorithms for RTP and RTCP, which have proven to work 
   well.  The new rules should scale from unicast to multicast, where 
   unicast or small multicast applications have the most gain from 
   it.  A detailed description of the new profile and its timing 
   rules can be found in [1]. 
    
   This document investigates the new algorithms by the means of 
   simulations.  We show that the new timing rules scale well and 
   behave in a network-friendly manner.  Firstly, the key features of 
   the new RTP profile that are important for our simulations are 
   roughly described in Section 3.  After that, we describe the 
   environment that is used to conduct the simulations in Section 4.  
   Section 5 describes simulation results that show the backwards 
   compatibility to RTP and that the new profile is network-friendly 
   in terms of used bandwidth for RTCP traffic.  In Section 6, we 
   show the benefit that applications could get from implementing the 
   new profile.  In Section 7 we investigated the effect of the 
   parameter "l" (used to calculate the T_dither_max value) upon the 
   algorithm performance and finally in Section 8 we show the 
   performance gain we could get for a special application, namely 
   NEWPRED in [6] and [7].

3 Timing rules of the extended RTP profile for RTCP-based feedback 
    
   As said above, RTP restricts the usage of RTCP feedback.  The main 
   restrictions on RTCP are as follows: 
    
   - RTCP messages are sent in compound packets, i.e. every RTCP 
   packet   
     contains at least one sender report (SR) or receiver report (RR) 
     message and a source description (SDES) message.

RTP/AVPF Profile    -Timing Rules Simulation Results û     June 2003 
    
    
    
   - The RTCP compound packets are sent in time intervals (T_rr), 
   which  
     are computed as a function of the average packet size, the 
   number  
     of senders and receivers in the group and the session bandwidth 
     (5% of the session bandwidth is used for RTCP messages; this  
     bandwidth is shared between all session members, where the 
   senders  
     may get a larger share than the receivers.)   
   - The average minimum interval between two RTCP packets from the 
   same source  
     is 5 seconds. 
    
   We see that these rules prevent feedback explosion and scale well 
   to large multicast groups.  However, they not allow timely 
   feedback at all.  While the second rule scales also to small 
   groups or unicast (in this cases the interval might be as small as 
   a few milliseconds), the third rule may prevent the receivers from 
   sending feedback timely.  
    
   The timing rules to send RTCP feedback from the new RTP profile 
   [1] consist of two key components.  First the minimum interval of 
   5 seconds is abolished.  Second, receivers get once during their 
   (now quite small) RTCP interval the chance to send an RTCP packet 
   "early", i.e. not according to the calculated interval, but 
   virtually immediately.  It is important to note that the RTCP 
   interval calculation is still inherited from the original RTP 
   specification.  
    
   The specification and all the details of the extended timing rules 
   can be found in [1].  We shall describe the algorithms here, but 
   rather reference these from the original specification where 
   needed.  Therefore we use also the same variable names and 
   abbreviations as in [1]. 
    
    
4 Simulation Environment 
    
   This section describes the simulation testbed that was used for 
   the investigations and its key features.  The extensions to the 
   simulator that were necessary are roughly described in the 
   following sections. 
    
    
4.1 Network Simulator Version 2 
    
   The simulations were conducted using the network simulator version 
   2 (ns2).  ns2 is an open source project, written in a combination 
   of Tool Command Language (TCL) and C++.  The scenarios are set-up 
   using TCL.  Using the scripts it is possible to specify the 
   topologies (nodes and links, bandwidths, queue sizes or error

   rates for links) and the parameters of the "agents", i.e. protocol 
   configurations.  The protocols themselves are implemented in C++ 
   in the agents, which are connected to the nodes.  The 
   documentation for ns2 and the newest version can be found in [4]. 
    
    
4.2 RTP Agent 
    
   We implemented a new agent, based on RTP/RTCP.  RTP packets are 
   sent at a constant packet rate with the correct header sizes.  
   RTCP packets are sent according to the timing rules of [2] and 
   also its algorithms for group membership maintenance are 
   implemented.  Sender and receiver reports are sent. 
    
   Further, we extended the agent to support the extended profile 
   [1].  The use of the new timing rules can be turned on and off via 
   parameter settings in TCL. 
    
    
4.3 Scenarios 
    
   The scenarios that are simulated are defined in TCL scripts.  We 
   set-up several different topologies, ranging from unicast with two 
   session members to multicast with up to 25 session members.  
   Depending on the sending rates used and the corresponding link 
   bandwidths, congestion losses may occur.  In some scenarios, bit 
   errors are inserted on certain links.  We simulated groups with 
   RTP/AVP agents, RTP/AVPF agents and mixed groups. 
    
   The feedback messages are generally NACK messages as defined in 
   [1] and are triggered by packet loss. 
    
    
4.4 Topologies 
    
   Mainly four different topologies are simulated to show the key 
   features of the extended profile.  However, for some specific 
   simulations we used different topologies.  This is then indicated 
   in the description of the simulation results.  The main four 
   topologies are named after the number of participating RTP agents, 
   i.e. T-2, T-4, T-8 and T-16, where T-2 is a unicast scenario, T-4 
   contains four agents, etc.  The figures below illustrate the main 
   topologies.

5 RTCP Bit Rate Measurements 
    
   The new timing rules allow more frequent RTCP feedback for small 
   multicast groups.  In large groups the algorithm behaves similarly 
   to the normal RTCP timing rules.  While it is generally good to 
   have more frequent feedback it cannot be allowed at all to 
   increase the bit rate used for RTCP above a fixed limit, i.e. 5% 
   of the total RTP bandwidth according to RTP.  This section shows 
   that the new timing rules keep RTCP bandwidth usage under the 5% 
   limit for all investigated scenarios, topologies and group sizes.  
   Furthermore, we show that mixed groups, i.e. some members using 
   AVP some AVPF, can be allowed and that each session member behaves 
   fairly according to its corresponding specification.  Note that 
   other values for the RTCP bandwidth limit may be specified using 
   the RTCP bandwidth modifiers as in [10]. 
    
    
5.1 Unicast 
    
   First we measured the RTCP bandwidth share in the unicast topology 
   T-2.  Even for a fixed topology and group size, there are several 
   protocol parameters which are varied to simulate a large range of 
   different scenarios.  We varied the configurations of the agents 
   in the sense that the agents may use the AVP or AVPF.  Thereby it 
   is possible that one agent uses AVP and the other AVPF in one RTP

   session.  This is done to test the backwards compatibility of the 
   AVPF profile.  
    
   First we consider scenarios where no losses occur.  In this case 
   both RTP session members transmit the RTCP compound packets at 
   regular intervals, calculated as T_rr, if they use the AVPF, and 
   use a minimum interval of 5s (in average) if they implement the 
   AVP.  No early packets are sent, because the need to send early 
   feedback is not given.  Still it is important to see that not more 
   than 5% of the session bandwidth is used for RTCP and that AVP and 
   AVPF members can co-exist without interference.  The results can 
   be found in table 1.

   Table 1: Unicast simulations without packet loss. 
    
   We can see that in configurations where both agents use the new 
   timing rules each of them uses, at most, about 2.5% of the session 
   bandwidth for RTP, which sums up to 5% of the session bandwidth 
   for both.  This is achieved regardless of the agent being a sender 
   or a receiver.  In the cases where agent A1 uses AVP and agent A2 
   AVPF, the total RTCP session bandwidth is decreased.  This is due 
   to the fact that agent A1 can send RTCP packets only with an 
   average minimum interval of 5 seconds.  Thus only a small fraction 
   of the session bandwidth is used for its RTCP packets.  For a high 
   bit rate session (session bandwidth = 2 Mbps) the fraction of the 
   RTCP packets from agent A1 is as small as 0.01%.  For smaller 
   session bandwidths the fraction increases, because the same amount 
   of RTCP data is sent.  The bandwidth share that is used by RTCP

   packets from agent A2 is not different from what was used, when 
   both agents implemented the AVPF.  Thus the interaction of AVP and 
   AVPF agents is not problematic in these scenarios at all. 
    
   In our second unicast experiment, we show that the allowed RTCP 
   bandwidth share is not exceeded, even if packet loss occurs.  We 
   simulated a constant byte error rate (BYER) on the link.  The byte 
   errors are inserted randomly according to an uniform distribution.  
   Packets with byte errors are discarded on the link; hence the 
   receiving agents will not see the loss immediately.  The agents 
   detect packet loss by a gap in the sequence number. 
    
   When an AVPF agent detects a packet loss the early feedback 
   procedure is started.  As described in AVPF [1], in unicast 
   T_dither_max is always zero, hence an early packet can be sent 
   immediately if allow_early is true.  If the last packet was 
   already an early one (i.e. allow_early = false), the feedback 
   might be appended to the next regularly scheduled receiver report.  
   The max_feedback_delay parameter (which we set to 1 second in our 
   simulations) determines if that is allowed. 
    
   The results are shown in table 2, where we can see that there is 
   no difference in the RTCP bandwidth share, whether losses occur or 
   not.  This is what we expected, because even though the RTCP 
   packet size grows and early packets are sent, the interval between 
   the packets increases and thus the RTCP bandwidth stays the same.  
   Only the RTCP bandwidth of the agents that use the AVP increases 
   slightly.  This is because the interval between the packets is 
   still 5 seconds (in average), but the packet size increased 
   because of the feedback that is appended.

5.2 Multicast 
    
   Next, we investigated the RTCP bandwidth share in multicast 
   scenarios, i.e. we simulated the topologies T-4, T-8 and T-16 and 
   measured the fraction of the session bandwidth that was used for 
   RTCP packets.  Again we considered different situations and 
   protocol configurations (e.g. with or without bit errors, groups 
   with AVP and/or AVPF agents, etc.).  For reasons of readability, 
   we present only selected results.  For a documentation of all 
   results, see [5].  
    
   The simulations of the different topologies in scenarios where no 
   losses occur (neither through bit errors nor through congestion) 
   show a similar behavior as in the unicast case.  For all group 
   sizes the maximum RTCP bit rate share used is 5.06% of the session 
   bandwidth in a simulation of 16 session members in a low bit rate 
   scenario (session bandwidth = 20kbps) with several senders.  In 
   all other scenarios without losses the RTCP bit rate share used is 
   below that.  Thus, the requirement that not more than 5% of the 
   session bit rate should be used for RTCP is fulfilled with 
   reasonable accuracy. 
    
   Simulations where bit errors are randomly inserted in RTP and RTCP 
   packets and the corrupted packets are discarded give the same 
   results.  The 5% rule is kept (at maximum 5.07% of the session 
   bandwidth is used for RTCP). 
    
   Finally we conducted simulations where we reduced the link 
   bandwidth and thereby caused congestion related losses.  These 
   simulations are different from the previous bit error simulations, 
   in that the losses occur more in bursts and are more correlated, 
   also between different agents.  The correlation and burstiness of 
   the packet loss is due to the queuing discipline in the routers we 
   simulated; we used simple FIFO queues with a drop-tail strategy to 
   handle congestion.  Random Early Detection (RED) queues may 
   enhance the performance, because the burstiness of the packet loss 
   might be reduced, however this is not the subject of our 
   investigations, but is left for future research.  The delay 
   between the agents, which also influences RTP and RTCP packets, is 
   much more variable because of the added queuing delay.  Still the 
   RTCP bit rate share used does not increase beyond 5.09% of the 
   session bandwidth.  Thus also for these special cases the 
   requirement is fulfilled.

5.3 Summary of the RTCP bit rate measurements 
    
   We have shown that for unicast and reasonable multicast scenarios, 
   feedback implosion does not happen.  The requirement that at 
   maximum 5% of the session bandwidth is used for RTCP is fulfilled 
   for all investigated scenarios. 
    
    
6 Feedback Measurements 
    
   In this chapter we describe the results of feedback delay 
   measurements, which we conducted in the simulations.  Therefore we 
   use two metrics for measuring the performance of the algorithms, 
   these are the "mean waiting time" (MWT) and the number of feedback 
   packets that are sent, suppressed or not allowed.  The waiting 
   time is the time, measured at a certain agent, between the 
   detection of a packet loss event and the time when the 
   corresponding feedback is sent.  Assuming that the value of the 
   feedback decreases with its delay, we think that the mean waiting 
   time is a good metric to measure the performance gain we could get 
   by using AVPF instead of AVP. 
    
   The feedback an RTP/AVPF agent wants to send can be either sent or 
   not sent.  If it was not sent, this could be due to the feedback 
   suppression, i.e. another receiver already sent the same feedback 
   or because the feedback was not allowed, i.e. the 
   max_feedback_delay was exceeded.  We traced for every detected 
   loss, if the agent sent the corresponding feedback or not and if 
   not, why.  The more feedback was not allowed, the worse the 
   performance of the algorithm.  Together with the waiting times, 
   this gives us a good hint of the overall performance of the 
   scheme. 
    
    
6.1 Unicast 
    
   In the unicast case, the maximum dithering interval T_dither_max 
   is fixed and set to zero.  This is due to the fact that it does 
   not make sense for a unicast receiver to wait for other receivers 
   if they have the same feedback to send.  But still feedback can be 
   delayed or might not be permitted to be sent at all.  The 
   regularly scheduled packets are spaced according to T_rr, which 
   depends in the unicast case mainly on the session bandwidth. 
    
   Table 3 shows the mean waiting times (MWT) measured in seconds for 
   some configurations of the unicast topology T-2.  The number of 
   feedback packets that are sent or discarded is listed also 
   (feedback sent (sent) or feedback discarded (disc)).  We do not 
   list suppressed packets, because for the unicast case feedback

   suppression does not apply.  In the simulations, agent A1 was a 
   sender and agent A2 a pure receiver.

   Table 3: Feedback Statistics for the unicast simulations. 
    
   From the table above we see that the mean waiting time can be 
   decreased dramatically by using AVPF instead of AVP.  While the 
   waiting times for agents using AVP is always around 2.5 seconds 
   (half the minimum interval average) it can be decreased to a few 
   ms for most of the AVPF configurations. 
    
   In the configurations with high session bandwidth, normally all 
   triggered feedback is sent.  This is because more RTCP bandwidth 
   is available.  There are only very few exceptions, which are 
   probably due to more than one packet loss within one RTCP 
   interval, where the first loss was by chance sent quite early.  In 
   this case it might be possible that the second feedback is 
   triggered after the early packet was sent, but possibly too early 
   to append it to the next regularly scheduled report, because of 
   the limitation of the max_feedback_delay.  This is different for 
   the cases with a small session bandwidth, where the RTCP bandwidth 
   share is quite low and T_rr thus larger.  After an early packet 
   was sent the time to the next regularly scheduled packet can be 
   very high.  We saw that in some cases the time was larger than the 
   max_feedback_delay and in these cases the feedback is not allowed 
   to be sent at all. 
    
   With a different setting of max_feedback_delay it is possible to 
   have either more feedback that is not allowed and a decreased mean 
   waiting time or more feedback that is sent but an increased 
   waiting time.  Thus the parameter should be set with care 
   according to the application's needs. 
    
    
6.2 Multicast 
    
   In this section we describe some measurements of feedback 
   statistics in the multicast simulations.  We picked out certain 
   characteristic and representative results.  We considered the

   topology T-16.  Different scenarios and applications are simulated 
   for this topology.  The parameters of the different links are set 
   as follows.  The agents A2, A3 and A4 are connected to the middle 
   node of the multicast tree, i.e. agent A1, via high bandwidth and 
   low delay links.  The other agents are connected to the nodes 2, 3 
   and 4 via different link characteristics.  The agents connected to 
   node 2 represent mobile users.  They suffer in certain 
   configurations from a certain byte error rate on their access 
   links and the delays are high.  The agents that are connected to 
   node 3 have low bandwidth access links, but do not suffer from bit 
   errors.  The last agents, that are connected to node 4 have high 
   bandwidth and low delay. 
    
6.2.1 Shared Losses vs. Distributed Losses 
    
   In our first investigation, we wanted to see the effect of the 
   loss characteristic on the algorithm's performance.  We 
   investigate the cases where packet loss occurs for several users 
   simultaneously (shared losses) or totally independently 
   (distributed losses).  We first define agent A1 to be the sender.  
   In the case of shared losses, we inserted a constant byte error 
   rate on one of the middle links, i.e. the link between A1 and A2.  
   In the case of distributed losses, we inserted the same byte error 
   rate on all links downstream of A2.  
    
   These scenarios are especially interesting because of the feedback 
   suppression algorithm.  When all receivers share the same loss, it 
   is only necessary for one of them to send the loss report.  Hence 
   if a member receives feedback with the same content that it has 
   scheduled to be sent, it suppresses the scheduled feedback.  Of 
   course, this suppressed feedback does not contribute to the mean 
   waiting times.  So we expect reduced waiting times for shared 
   losses, because the probability is high that one of the receivers 
   can send the feedback more or less immediately.  The results are 
   shown in the following table.

   session.  However only agent A1 acts as an RTP sender, the other

   agents are pure receivers.  Only 4 or 5 agents suffer from packet 
   loss, i.e. A2, A5, A6, A7 and A8 for the case of shared losses and 
   A5, A6, A7 and A8 in the case of distributed losses.  Since the 
   number of session members is the same for both cases, T_rr is also 
   the same on the average.  Still the mean waiting times are reduced 
   by more than 50% in the case of shared losses.  This proves our 
   assumption that shared losses enhance the performance of the 
   algorithm, regardless of the loss characteristic. 
    
   The feedback suppression mechanism seems to be working quite well.  
   Even though some feedback is sent from different receivers (i.e. 
   1150 loss reports are sent in total and only 650 packets were 
   lost, resulting in loss reports being received on the average 1.8 
   times) most of the redundant feedback was suppressed.  That is, 
   2023 loss reports were suppressed from 3250 individual detected 
   losses, which means that more than 60% of the feedback was 
   actually suppressed. 
    
    
7 Investigations on "l" 
    
   In this section we want to investigate the effect of the parameter 
   "l" on the T_dither_max calculation in RTP/AVPF agents.  We 
   investigate the feedback suppression performance as well as the 
   report delay for three sample scenarios. 
    
   For all receivers the T_dither_max value is calculated as 
   T_dither_max = l * T_rr, with l = 0.5.  The rationale for this is 
   that, in general, if the receiver has no RTT estimation, it does 
   not know how long it should wait for other receivers to send 
   feedback.  The feedback suppression algorithm would certainly fail 
   if the time selected is too short.  However, the waiting time is 
   increased unnecessarily (and thus the value of the feedback is 
   decreased) in case the chosen value is too large.  Ideally, the 
   optimum time value could be found for each case but this is not 
   always feasible.  On the other hand, it is not dangerous if the 
   optimum time is not used.  A decreased feedback value and a 
   failure of the feedback suppression mechanism do not hurt the 
   network stability.  We have shown for the cases of distributed 
   losses that the overall bandwidth constraints are kept in any case 
   and thus we could only lose some performance by choosing the wrong 
   time value.  On the other hand, a good measure for T_dither_max 
   however is the RTCP interval T_rr.  This value increases with the 
   number of session members.  Also, we know that we can send 
   feedback at least every T_rr.  Thus increasing T_dither max beyond 
   T_rr would certainly make no sense.  So by choosing T_rr/2 we 
   guarantee that at least sometimes (i.e. when a loss is detected in 
   the first half of the interval between two regularly scheduled 
   RTCP packets) we are allowed to send early packets.  Because of 
   the randomness of T_dither we still have a good chance to send the 
   early packet in time.

   The AVPF profile specifies that the calculation of T_dither_max, 
   as given above, is common to session members having an RTT 
   estimation and to those not having it.  If this were not so, 
   participants using different calculations for T_dither_max might 
   also have very different mean waiting times before sending 
   feedback, which translates into different reporting priorities.  
   For example, in an scenario where T_rr = 1s and the RTT = 100 ms, 
   receivers using the RTT estimation would, on average, send more 
   feedback than those not using it.  This might partially cancel out 
   the feedback suppression mechanism and even cause feedback 
   implosion.  Also note that, in a general case where the losses are 
   shared, the feedback suppression mechanism works if the feedback 
   packets from each receiver have enough time to reach each of the 
   other ones before the calculated T_dither_max seconds.  Therefore, 
   in scenarios of very high bandwidth (small T_rr) the calculated 
   T_dither_max could be much smaller than the propagation delay 
   between receivers, which would translate into a failure of the 
   feedback suppression mechanism.  In these cases, one solution 
   could be to limit the bandwidth available to receivers (see [10]) 
   such that this does not happen.  Another solution could be to 
   develop a mechanism for feedback suppression based on the RTT 
   estimation between senders.  This will not be discussed here and 
   may be object of another document.  Note, however, that a really 
   high bandwidth media stream is not that likely to rely on this 
   kind of error repair in the first place. 
    
   In the following, we define three representative sample scenarios.  
   We use the topology from the previous section, T-16.  Most of the 
   agents contribute only little to the simulations, because we 
   introduced an error rate only on the link between the sender A1 
   and the agent A2. 
    
   The first scenario represents those cases, where losses are shared 
   between two agents.  One agent is located upstream on the path 
   between the other agent and the sender.  Therefore, agent A2 and 
   agent A5 see the same losses that are introduced on the link 
   between the sender and agent A2.  Agents A6, A7 and A8 do not join 
   the RTP session.  From the other agents only agents A3 and A9 
   join.  All agents are pure receivers, except A1 which is the 
   sender.  
    
   The second scenario represents also cases, where losses are shared 
   between two agents, but this time the agents are located on 
   different branches of the multicast tree.  The delays to the 
   sender are roughly of the same magnitude.  Agents A5 and A6 share 
   the same losses.  Agents A3 and A9 join the RTP session, but are 
   pure receivers and do not see any losses.  
    
   Finally, in the third scenario, the losses are shared between two 
   agents, A5 and A6.  The same agents as in the second scenario are

   active.  However, the delays of the links are different.  The 
   delay of the link between agent A2 and A5 is reduced to 20ms and 
   between A2 and A6 to 40ms.  
    
   All agents beside agent A1 are pure RTP receivers.  Thus these 
   agents do not have an RTT estimation to the source.  T_dither_max 
   is calculated with the above given formula, depending only on T_rr 
   and l, which means that all agents should calculate roughly the 
   same T_dither_max. 
 
 
7.1 Feedback Suppression Performance 
    
   The feedback suppression rate for an agent is defined as the ratio 
   of the total number of feedback packets not sent out of the total 
   number of feedback packets the agent intended to send (i.e. the 
   sum of sent and not sent).  The reasons for not sending a packet 
   include: the receiver already saw the same loss reported in a 
   receiver report coming from another session member or the 
   max_feedback_delay (application-specific) was surpassed.  
    
   The results for the feedback suppression rate of the agent Af that 
   is further away from the sender, are depicted in Table 10.  In 
   general it can be seen that the feedback suppression rate 
   increases with an increasing l.  However there is a threshold, 
   depending on the environment, from which the additional gain is 
   not significant anymore.

   Summarizing the feedback suppression results, it can be said that 
   in general the feedback suppression performance increases with an 
   increasing l.  However, beyond a certain threshold, depending on 
   environment parameters such as propagation delays or session 
   bandwidth, the additional increase is not significant anymore. 
   This threshold is not uniform across all scenarios; a value of 
   l=0.5 seems to produce reasonable results with acceptable (though 
   not optimal) overhead.

   In this section we show the results for the measured report delay 
   during the simulations of the three sample scenarios.  This 
   measurement is a metric of the performance of the algorithms, 
   because the value of the feedback for the sender typically 
   decreases with the delay of its reception.  The loss report delay 
   is measured as the time at the sender between sending a packet and 
   receiving the first corresponding loss report.

   Table 13: The mean loss report delay, measured at the sender. 
    
   As can be seen from Table 13 the delay increases in general with 
   an increasing value of l. Also, a similar effect as for the 
   feedback suppression performance is present: beyond a certain 
   threshold, the additional increase in delay is not significant 
   anymore.  The threshold is environment dependent and seems to be 
   related to the threshold, where the feedback suppression gain 
   would not increase anymore. 
    
    
7.3 Summary of "l" investigations 
    
   We have shown experimentally that the performance of the feedback 
   suppression mechanisms increases with an increasing value of l.  
   The same applies for the report delay, which increases also with 
   an increasing l.  This leads to a threshold where both the 
   performance and the delay does not increase any further.  The 
   threshold is dependent upon the environment. 
    
   So finding an optimum value of l is not possible because it is 
   always a trade-off between delay and feedback suppression 
   performance.  With l=0.5 we think that a tradeoff was found that 
   is acceptable for typical applications and environments. 
    
    
8 Applications Using AVPF

   NEWPRED is one of the error resilience tools, which is defined in 
   both ISO/IEC MPEG-4 visual part and ITU-T H.263.  NEWPRED achieves 
   fast error recovery using feedback messages.  We simulated the 
   behavior of NEWPRED in the network simulator environment as 
   described above and measured the waiting time statistics, in order 
   to verify that the extended RTP profile for RTCP-based feedback 
   (AVPF)[1] is appropriate for the NEWPRED feedback messages.  
   Simulation results, which are presented in the following sections, 
   show that the waiting time is small enough to get the expected 
   performance of NEWPRED. 
    
    
8.1 NEWPRED Implementation in NS2 
 
   The agent that performs the NEWPRED functionality, called NEWPRED 
   agent, is different from the RTP agent we described above.  Some 
   of the added features and functionalities are described in the 
   following points: 
    
   Application Feedback 
     The "Application Layer Feedback Messages" format is used to    
     transmit the NEWPRED feedback messages.  Thereby the NEWPRED  
     functionality is added to the RTP agent.  The NEWPRED agent 
     creates one NACK message for each lost segment of a video frame, 
     and then assembles multiple NACK messages corresponding 
     to the segments in the same video frame into one Application 
     Layer Feedback Message.  Although there are two modes, namely 
     NACK mode and ACK mode, in NEWPRED [6][7], only NACK mode is 
   used 
     in these simulations. 
    
     The parameters of NEWPRED agent are as follows: 
           f: Frame Rate(frames/sec) 
         seg: Number of segments in one video frame 
          bw: RTP session bandwidth(kbps) 
    
   Generation of NEWPRED's NACK Messages 
     The NEWPRED agent generates NACK messages when segments are 
   lost. 
     a. The NEWPRED agent generates multiple NACK messages per  
        one video frame when multiple segments are lost.  These  
        are assembled into one FCI message per video frame.  If there 
        is no lost segment, no message is generated and sent. 
     b. The length of one NACK message is 4 bytes.  Let num be the  
        number of NACK messages in one video frame (1 <= num <= seg).   
        Thus, 12+4*num bytes is the size of the low delay RTCP 
   feedback  
        message. 
    
   Measurements 
     We defined two values to be measured:

RTP/AVPF Profile    -Timing Rules Simulation Results û     June 2003 
    
    
    
     - Recovery time 
       The recovery time is measured as the time between the 
   detection  
       of a lost segment and reception of a recovered segment.  We  
       measured this "recovery time" for each lost segment. 
     - Waiting time 
       The waiting time is the additional delay due to the feedback  
       limitation of RTP. 
    
     Fig.1 depicts the behavior of a NEWPRED agent when a loss 
   occurs. 
     The recovery time is approximated as follows: 
       (Recovery time) = (Waiting time) +  
                         (Transmission time for feedback message) +  
                         (Transmission time for media data) 
    
     Therefore, the waiting time is derived as follows: 
    
       (Waiting time) = (Recovery time) - (Round-trip delay), where  
    
       (Round-trip delay ) = (Transmission time for feedback message) 
   +  
                             (Transmission time for media data)

8.2 Simulation 
    
   We conducted two simulations (Simulation A and Simulation B).  In 
   Simulation A, the packets are dropped with a fixed packet loss 
   rate on a link between two NEWPRED agents.  In Simulation B, 
   packet loss occurs due to congestion from other traffic sources, 
   i.e. ftp sessions.

   Table 14: Parameter sets of the NEWPRED agents 
    
   Figure3 shows the packet loss rate vs. mean of waiting time.  A 
   plotted line represents a parameter ID ( "[session bandwidth] - 
   [frame rate] - [the number of segments] - [link2 delay]" ).  E.g. 
   384k-15-9-100 means the session of 384kbps session bandwidth, 15 
   frames per second, 9 segments per frame and 100msec link delay. 
    
   When the packet loss rate is 5% and the session bandwidth is 
   32kbps, the waiting time is around 400msec, which is just 
   allowable for reasonable NEWPRED performance. 
    
   When the packet loss rate is less than 1%, the waiting time is 
   less than 200msec. In such a case, the NEWPRED allows as much as 
   200msec additional link delay.  
    
   When the packet loss rate is less than 5% and the session 
   bandwidth is 64kbps, the waiting time is also less than 200msec. 
    
   In 128kbps cases, the result shows that when the packet loss rate 
   is 20%, the waiting time is around 200msec.  In cases with more 
   than 512kbps session bandwidth, there is no significant delay.  
   This means that the waiting time due to the feedback limitation of 
   RTCP is neglectable for the NEWPRED performance.

   The parameters are defined as for Simulation A with the following 
   values assigned:  
    
      D[ms] ={10, 50, 100, 200, 500} 
      32 FTP agents are deployed at each edge, for a total of 64 FTP     
      agents active. 
      The sets of session bandwidth, frame rate, the number of 
   segments  
      are the same as in Simulation A (Table 14) 
    
   We provide the results for the cases with 64 FTP agents, because 
   these are the cases where packet losses could be detected to be 
   stable.  The results are similar to the Simulation A except for a 
   constant additional offset of 50..100ms.  This is due to the delay 
   incurred by the routers' buffers. 
    
8.3 Summary of Application Simulations 
    
   We have shown that the limitations of RTP AVPF profile do not 
   generate such high delay in the feedback messages that the 
   performance of NEWPRED is degraded for sessions from 32kbps to 
   2Mbps.  We could see that the waiting time increases with a 
   decreasing session bandwidth and/or an increasing packet loss 
   rate.  The cause of the packet loss is not significant; congestion 
   and constant packet loss rates behave similarly.  Still we see

   that for reasonable conditions and parameters the AVPF is well 
   suited to support the feedback needed for NEWPRED.  
    
    
9 Summary 
    
   The new RTP profile AVPF was investigated regarding performance 
   and potential risks to the network stability.  Simulations were 
   conducted using the network simulator, simulating unicast and 
   several differently sized multicast topologies.  The results were 
   shown in this document. 
    
   Regarding the network stability, it was important to show that the 
   new profile does not lead to any feedback implosion, or use more 
   bandwidth as it is allowed.  Thus we measured the bandwidth that 
   was used for RTCP in relation to the RTP session bandwidth.  We 
   have shown that, more or less exactly, 5% of the session bandwidth 
   is used for RTCP, in all considered scenarios.  Other RTCP 
   bandwidth values could be set using the RTCP bandwidth modifiers 
   [10].  The scenarios included unicast with and without errors, 
   different sized multicast groups, with and without errors or 
   congestion on the links.  Thus we can say that the new profile 
   behaves network-friendly in the sense that it uses only the 
   allowed RTCP bandwidth, as defined by RTP. 
    
   Secondly, we have shown that receivers using the new profile 
   experience a performance gain.  This was measured by capturing the 
   delay that the sender sees for the received feedback.  Using the 
   new profile this delay can be decreased by orders of magnitude. 
    
   In the third place, we investigated the effect of the parameter 
   "l" on the new algorithms.  We have shown that there does not 
   exist an optimum value for it but only a trade-off can be 
   achieved.  The influence of this parameter is highly environment-
   specific and a trade-off between performance of the feedback 
   suppression algorithm and the experienced delay has to be met.  
   The recommended value of l= 0.5 given in the draft seems to be 
   reasonable for most applications and environments.
