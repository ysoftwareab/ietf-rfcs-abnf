Abstract

   RFC2812 introduced the ability to set certain usermodes before
   connection has occurred via a simple extension to the USER command.
   However, this implementation is believed to be excessively limiting.
   The RFC2812 implementation only allows a limited number of modes (+i
   and +w) to be set.  Modern IRC servers provide many more modes and a
   method is necessary to set these modes at the pre-connection stage.

   Therefore, this specification introduces a method to allow users to
   set arbitrary usermodes at the pre-connection stage while maintaining

1.  Introduction

   The method defined in RFC2812 for specifying usermodes in the USER
   command is limited and flawed.  To begin with, it violates a
   significant rule of programming practice: external interfaces should
   not rely on internal implementations.  RFC2812 states that the mode
   parameter of the USER command is a bitflag value with each bit
   representing a specific mode.  This indicates that the client must
   have knowledge of the internal workings of the server.  This should
   not be the case.  It is quite possible that a particular IRC
   implementation has decided to implement modes in a manner that does
   not rely on bitflags.  Secondly, it is limited to only the +i and +w
   modes.  While this may be fine for servers that strictly conform to
   RFC2812, the original IRC specification, RFC1459, states that
   additional usermodes may be added (See RFC1459 Section 4.2.3.2
   [RFC1459]).  Hence, to support these new modes, a more robust method
   of pre-connection mode setting is necessary.

2.  USER Message Extension

   As defined in RFC2812 Section 3.1.3 [RFC2812], the syntax for the
   USER message is as follows:
   USER SP <user> SP <mode> SP <unused> SP <realname>

   As previously stated, the <mode> parameter is a bitflag.  The value
   of this flag must be an integer (bitflag) with bits 2 and 3 being
   significant.  This extension modifies the mode parameter to the
   following as defined in ABNF Syntax [RFC2234]:
        mode  = "4"/"8"/"12"       ; RFC2812 style mode setting
        mode /= "+" modecharacters ; Extended style mode setting
        modecharacters             ; See RFC1459 Section 4.2.3.2
                                   ; and RFC2812 Section 3.1.5

   With the latter definition of mode, any arbitrary mode may be set.
   In order to determine whether the modes were set successfully, after
   the connection sequences has been completed, the user SHOULD issue a
   MODE command to determine the modes that are currently enabled.  See
   the Security Considerations for information on ensuring the security
   of this extension.

   Examples:
   USER foo 8 unused :My Name is Foo   ; Using the RFC2812 style to
                                       ; set +i
   USER foo +i unused :My Name is Foo  ; Using the new style mode
                                       ; parameter to do the same

   This allows new modes to be added to the IRC protocol with the
   ability to be set in the pre-connection phase.

3.  Security Considerations

   Care must be taken by the implementors to ensure that only modes that
   a user should have access to set are settable.  For example, if a
   user attempts to specify the +o usermode, the server MUST ignore this
   as it could be a potential security breach otherwise.  For the most
   part, the same security practices in place for post-connection mode
   setting should be used for pre-connection mode setting.

   I would like to take the time to acknowledge the hard work and

   making IRC the feature rich communication medium that it is today and
   who receive little or nothing in return.
