1.  Introduction

   Multicast scopes are defined in [RFC4291].  The [RFC7346] extends the
   scope definition with the text:

   "Interface-Local, Link-Local, and Realm-Local scope boundaries are
   automatically derived from physical connectivity or other, non-
   multicast related configuration.  Global scope has no boundary.  The
   boundaries of all other non-reserved scopes of Admin-Local or larger
   are administratively configured."

   The admin-local scope must therefore be administratively configured.
   This draft describes an automated policy for the MPL forwarding of
   multicast messages with admin-local scope within a border router.
   This wish is in line with the autonomous networking ideas presented
   in [I-D.irtf-nmrg-an-gap-analysis].

   The realm-local multicast address is currently used by MPL to
   propagate the multicast message to all receivers and forwarders

   within a mesh network.  The multicast propagation is limited to a
   mesh network with a common layer-2.  For example, a LoWPAN is defined
   by an IEEE 802.15.4 layer-2 mesh network, composed of all connected
   nodes sharing the same PAN ID [RFC4944].

   The network concept differs between mesh network technologies.  This
   document maps a general network identifier to the specific network
   identifier of existing mesh technologies.

   In current and projected deployments, there is a requirement to
   propagate a multicast message beyond the boundaries of the mesh
   network it originated in independent of the mesh technology.

   Consider the case where propagation over two mesh networks is
   required.  In one example, each mesh network has a border router and
   the two border routers are connected with an Ethernet link.  In
   another example each mesh network is connected to its own network
   interface connected to the same border router.  In both cases, an
   admin-local multicast message originating in one network needs to
   propagate into the other mesh network.  The boundary of the admin-
   local scope is administratively configured.

   This document describes an "MPL4 router" that forwards MPL messages
   with a multicast address with admin-local scope to all interfaces
   connected to links that connect to other MPL enabled interfaces.  The
   MPL4 router enables all its interfaces for MPL messages and allocates
   an additional variable MPL_BLOCKED that permits(forbids) the
   forwarding of MPL messages.

   It is expected that the network of an organization, building, or
   home, is connected to the Internet via the edge routers provided by
   an ISP.  The intention is that within the network of an organization,
   building, or home, MPL messages with multicast addresses of admin-
   local scope are freely forwarded but are never forwarded to edge
   routers which MUST NOT enable their interfaces for MPL messages.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology and Acronyms

   This document uses terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-trickle-mcast] and [RFC7346].  In addition, the
   following terms are used in this document:




van der Stok & Cragie     Expires May 28, 2015                  [Page 3]


Internet-Draft           MPL admin-local policy            November 2014


   o  MPL4 message: an MPL DATA message with a destination multicast
      address of scope 4.

   o  MPL4 router: automatically determines the zone in which MPL
      messages with admin-local scope can be propagated.

   o  MPL4 zone: a convex zone of interconnected interfaces over which
      MPL messages with admin-local scope propagate.  [RFC4007].

2.  Network identifier

   Links may have the concept of a channel, for example in wireless
   networks such a channel is associated with a communication frequency.
   Additionally, for some link technologies, several networks can
   coexist using the same channel.  For these link technologies, a
   network identifier exists.  The network identifier is determined by
   the link technology specification.  When no network identifier exists
   for a given link, the network identifier has the value "undefined".

2.1.  IEEE 802.15.4

   IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4 is described in [RFC4944].  A LoWPAN is
   composed of the nodes connected by an IEEE 802.15.4 mesh sharing the
   same PAN ID.  The PAN ID identifies a network in the IEEE 802.15.4
   mesh.  Several networks with different PAN IDs can coexist on the
   same channel [IEEE802.15.4].  The PAN ID of an interface is defined
   when the interface is enabled.  The value of the network identifier
   of an IEEE 802.15.4 link is the value of the PAN ID.

2.2.  IEEE 802.11

   IP over IEEE 802.11 is described in [RFC5416].  The SSID identifies a
   network in the IEEE 802.11 link.  Several networks with different
   SSIDs can coexist on the same channel [IEEE802.11].  The SSID of an
   interface is defined when the interface is switched on.  The value of
   the network identifier of a IEEE 802.11 link is the value of the
   SSID.

2.3.  ITU-T G.9959

   IPv6 over ITU-T G.9959 is specified in [I-D.ietf-6lo-lowpanz].  The
   HomeID identifies a network of connected nodes [G.9959].  Several
   HomeIDs can coexist within communication range, but nodes adhering to
   a network with a given HomeID cannot communicate with nodes adhering
   to a network with a different HomeID.  The value of the network
   identifier of a G.9959 link is the value of the HomeID.

2.4.  BLUETOOTH Low Energy

   IPv6 over BLUETOOTH Low Energy (BTLE) is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-btle].  The medium is specified in [btle].

   BTLE does not know the concept of multiple networks in one channel.
   The value of the network identifier of a BTLE link is "any".

3.  MPL4 router

   The concept of an MPL4 router serves to automatically determine the
   zone in which MPL messages with an scope 4 multicast address can
   propagate.  The MPL4 router periodically executes an algorithm that
   determines the presence of MPL interfaces on the links connected to
   its interfaces.  When no MPL interfaces are present on a given link,
   the corresponding MPL interface is signalled as not being part of the
   MPL zone.

3.1.  MPL interface parameters

   One parameter is associated with every MPL interface in the MPL4
   router, and two parameters are associated with the behaviour of the
   MPL4 router as a whole.

   o  MPL_BLOCKED: Boolean value that indicates whether the associated
      interface belongs to the MPL zone.

   o  MPL_CHECK_INT: integer that indicates the time interval between
      successive activations of the MPL4 router algorithm in seconds.

   o  MPL_TO: integer that indicates the interval in which MPL messages
      are expected in seconds.

3.2.  Determination of MPL zone

   All interfaces of the MPL4 router MUST be associated with following
   parameters coming from MPL protocol [I-D.ietf-roll-trickle-mcast]:
   PROACTIVE_FORWARDING, DATA_MESSAGE_IMIN, DATA_MESSAGE_IMAX,
   DATA_MESSAGE_K, DATA_MESSAGE_TIMER_EXPIRATIONS.  At start-up of the
   MPL4 router, the parameters associated with all interfaces are
   assigned the following values: PROACTIVE_FORWARDING = true,
   MPL_BLOCKED = false.  All interfaces MUST subscribe to the multicast
   addresses ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS scope 3 and scope 4.

   The MPL4 router executes the following algorithm for each interface:

   o  With a frequency determined by the value of MPL_CHECK_INT, the
      MPL4 router sends an MPL4 message on each interface with a header



van der Stok & Cragie     Expires May 28, 2015                  [Page 5]


Internet-Draft           MPL admin-local policy            November 2014


      that includes the MPL option and is sent to multicast address
      ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS with scope 4.

   o  When within an interval determined by the value of MPL_TO no MPL
      message is received, the value of MPL_BLOCKED is set to true.

   o  At reception of an MPL4 message with a multicast address with
      scope 4, the value of MPL_BLOCKED of the receiving interface is
      set to false.

   This protocol leads to a state where for each interface MPL_BLOCKED
   is set to false if and only if MPL enabled interfaces are connected
   to the link associated with the interface.  When an MPL message is
   submitted to an MPL-enabled interface -called A- in the MPL router,
   the TRICKLE algorithm is activated to send the MPL message.  The MPL4
   message with multicast address ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS scope 4 is accepted
   by every interface connected to the link that has subscribed to
   ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS with scope 4.  On acceptance of the MPL4 message
   by an interface -called B-, the MPL4 message is returned with Trickle
   over interface B.  Consequently, the MPL4 message is received by the
   originating interface A, after which MPL_BLOCKED is set to false.

   When a new node is connected to the link, it can immediately send an
   MPL4 message, or can wait for the reception of an MPL4 message to
   announce its intention to be part of the MPL zone.

4.  Admin-Local policy

   The section starts with specifying what multicast messages arriving
   at an interface are legal.  It continues with a description of
   forwarding legal admin-local multicast messages over other MPL
   interfaces.

   The policy for forwarding admin-local multicast messages
   automatically to a MPL interface is specified as function of the
   state of the MPL interface and the multicast message.  The state of
   the multicast message is determined by the presence of the MPL option
   and the destination multicast address.  The state of the MPL
   interface is determined by the subscribed multicast addresses, and
   the values of the PROACTIVE_FORWARDING parameter and the MPL_BLOCKED
   parameter of the MPL interface.

4.1.  Legal multicast messages

   Multicast messages can be created within the node by an application
   or can arrive at an interface.





van der Stok & Cragie     Expires May 28, 2015                  [Page 6]


Internet-Draft           MPL admin-local policy            November 2014


   A multicast message created at a source (MPL seed) is legal when it
   conforms to the properties described in section 9.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-roll-trickle-mcast].

   A multicast message received at a given interface is legal when:

   o  The message carries an MPL option (MPL message) and the incoming
      MPL interface is subscribed to the destination multicast address.

   o  The message does not carry an MPL option, the multicast address is
      unequal to ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS scope 4 or scope 3, and the
      interface has expressed interest to receive messages with the
      specified multicast address via MLD [RFC3810] or via IGMP
      [RFC3376].  The message was sent on according to PIM-DM [RFC3973]
      or according to PIM-SM [RFC4601].

   Illegal multicast messages are discarded.

4.2.  Forwarding legal packets

   A legal multicast message received at a given interface is assigned
   the network identifier of the interface of the incoming link . A
   message that is created within the node is assigned the network
   identifier "any".

   Two types of legal multicast messages are considered: (1) MPL
   messages, and (2) multicast messages which do not carry the MPL
   option.

4.2.1.  MPL message

   MPL messages are forwarded on MPL interfaces using the Trickle
   parameter values assigned to the MPL interface according to the
   following rules:

   o  Link-local (scope 2) MPL messages are not forwarded.

   o  Realm-local (scope 3) MPL messages are forwarded on all MPL
      interfaces that are subscribed to the same multicast address and
      have PROACTIVE-FORWARDING set to true, and the assigned network
      identifier of the multicast message is identical to the network
      identifier of the MPL interface, or the assigned network
      identifier of the multicast message is "any".

   o  Admin-local (scope 4) MPL messages are forwarded on all MPL
      interfaces that are subscribed to the same multicast address, have
      PROACTIVE-FORWARDING set to true, and have MPL_BLOCKED set to
      false.

Internet-Draft           MPL admin-local policy            November 2014


   o  MPL messages with a multicast scope of 5 or higher MUST
      encapsulate a message with the same multicast address without MPL
      option.  The decapsulated message can be forwarded over an
      interface when the interface is subscribed with MLD to the same
      multicast address.

4.2.2.  Multicast messages without MPL option

   Multicast messages without MPL option are forwarded on MPL interfaces
   according to the following rules:

   o  Link-local (scope 2) messages or realm-local (scope 3) multicast
      messages are not forwarded.

   o  Admin-local (scope 4) multicast messages are encapsulated with a
      header carrying the MPL option and are forwarded on al MPL
      interfaces that are subscribed to the multicast address, have
      PROACTIVE_FORWARDING set to true, and have MPL_BLOCKED set to
      false.

   o  Multicast messages with a multicast scope of 5 or higher are
      encapsulated with a header carrying the MPL option and are
      forwarded on al MPL interfaces that are subscribed to the
      multicast address, have PROACTIVE_FORWARDING set to true, and have
      MPL_BLOCKED set to false.  In addition these messages follow the
      Multicast forwarding rules as specified by PIM [RFC3973],
      [RFC4601] according to group specifications enabled by MLD
      [RFC3810] or IGMP [RFC3376].

5.  MPL domains and zones

   An MPL domain is a scope zone in which MPL interfaces subscribe to
   the same MPL Domain Address [I-D.ietf-roll-trickle-mcast].  In
   accordance with [RFC4007] a zone boundary passes through a node.  For
   example, a small LLN node usually has one MPL mesh interface which is
   enabled to the ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS multicast address with a scope
   value of 3 (realm-local) [RFC7346].  The node interface belongs to
   the zone and the corresponding zone boundary does not pass through
   this node.  In the border router with MPL interfaces enabled to the
   multicast address ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS with scope value 3, the zone
   includes usually this single interface and excludes all other
   interfaces.  A notable exception is provided by a node where MPL
   interfaces of the same technology share the same network identifier.
   These interfaces belong to the same zone.

   In an MPL4 router, every MPL interface subscribes to the admin_local
   ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS multicast address next to the realm-local
   ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS address.



van der Stok & Cragie     Expires May 28, 2015                  [Page 8]


Internet-Draft           MPL admin-local policy            November 2014


   Every interface that belongs to an MPL domain that extends over
   border routers MUST be subscribed to the admin-local
   ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS address.

   The zone corresponding with the MPL multicast address
   ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS with scope 4 (Admin-local) applies to border
   routers with multiple interfaces, of which at least one interface is
   MPL enabled and is subscribed to multicast address ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS
   with scope 4.  In a border router, all MPL enabled interfaces which
   subscribe to the ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS address with scope 4 and for
   which MPL_BLOCKED is false belong to the same zone.

6.  Default parameter values

   Three parameters are created in this draft.  Their values are related
   to the trickle timer intervals.

   MPL_TO = DATA_MESSAGE_IMAX times 2.  Which leaves the time to receive
   the second response message.

   MPL_CHECK_INT = 5 minutes.  Which means that a reaction to network
   malfunctioning happens within 5 minutes.

   MPL_BLOCKED = true.  Which means that the interface must have
   received MPL-enabled messages to include the interface to the zone.

7.  Security Considerations

   Refer to the security considerations of
   [I-D.ietf-roll-trickle-mcast].

   MPL enabled interfaces MUST subscribe to the ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS
   address with scope 3 and scope 4.  In the latter case the nodes may
   become flooded by multicast messages with as destination
   ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS address with scope 4 coming from outside the zone
   corresponding with the connected mesh networks.  Therefore, Multicast
   messages with address ALL_MPL_FORWADERS scope 4 and scope 3 cannot be
   forwarded from sources out of the zone corresponding with the scope 4
   address.

   The enabling of the interfaces for a given set of multicast addresses
   and the setting of the MPL parameter values must be done in a secure
   way, such that they cannot be set or modified by unauthorized nodes.
   That means a setting of the parameters with secured means, or
   initializing the parameter values in the factory without
   possibilities for change afterwards.
