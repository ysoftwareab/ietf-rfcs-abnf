Abstract 

   This document defines additional civic address parameters for use in 
   Location Objects [1] and [4].  The format is based on the civic 
   address definition of PIDF-LO.  These addition parameters allow 
   expression of a relative location.

1. Introduction 

   Wireless LAN technologies are adding capabilities to locate serving 
   hosts via radio frequency measurement technologies.  This new 
   capability is able to provide additional and more accurate location 
   information when used inside a building where GPS technologies are 
   normally not available.   The data produced from these technologies 
   is most useful if expressed as relative position.  Similar to global 
   positioning coordinate systems, designation of a reference starting 
   point is used.  Differing from global positioning coordinate systems, 
   distance from the starting point is expressed as a 2 dimensional 
   measurement instead of geographic coordinates. 

   The data included within the relative position parameters is 
   supplementary to, not exclusive of, the existing civic location data 
   expressed in PIDF-LO, [1] and [4].  An example of this may be a 
   popular wireless hotspot located at 234 N. Main St.  It is reasonable 
   to expect that 234 N. Main St. covers a geographic area that 
   encompasses several hundred square meters.  The wireless network 
   architecture for this hotspot could include several wireless 
   infrastructure access points.  The supplementary data provided via

   relative location would enable a more granular location expression.  
   In addition to providing 234 N. Main St., a relative position like 
   "20 feet south and 40 feet east of the main entrance" could be added. 

   Although PIDF-LO civic location currently supports additional 
   elements, like CAtypes 28 (room), 32 (additional code), or 33 (seat), 
   results from the radio frequency measurement technologies are 
   alternatives to these existing elements and in some cases the 
   resultant value is more accurate. 

2. Additions to PIDF-LO 

   PIDF-LO, as updated by [2], includes a full set of parameters used to 
   describe civic locations.  The new parameters defined here are 
   additional to the updated set and provide a means to describe a 
   host's civic location with added granularity. 

3. Relative Location 

   Relative location is defined by 2 new parameters, reference point and 
   relative position.  Reference point, similar to geodetic datum, 
   defines the anchor point (0,0 point) used for measurement of the 
   relative position parameter.  Measurement from the anchor point is 
   provided in 2 dimensions, X and Y.  The east-west dimension is 
   labeled X and north-south dimension is labeled Y.  Similar to the 
   well-known geodetic systems, a positive value is considered north of 
   the reference point, a negative value south of the reference point, a 
   positive value for east of the reference point and a negative value 
   for west of the reference point.  A third value in this relative 
   position parameter defines the measurement unit (MU).  Lack of 
   expressing a measurement unit defaults the unit value to meters. 

   The height or altitude parameter (Z) found in normal geodetic systems 
   is not expressed via these new parameters as this is already covered 
   by CAtype 27, the FLR or Floor parameter, previously defined for 
   PIDF-LO.

4. Security Considerations 

   The XML parameters defined in the document are additions to the 
   current PIDF-LO specification.  Therefore the parameters defined here 
   are subject to the same security considerations of [1]. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   IANA will register CAtypes 40 and 41 as shown in Table 1 in the 
   CAtypes registry under the Geopriv Location Types Registries.
