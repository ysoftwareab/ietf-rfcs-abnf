Internet-Draft           The WebFinger Protocol             October 2009


Abstract

   This memo specifies the WebFinger, a protocol for obtaining account
   metadata, as well as the 'acct' URI scheme. 'acct' URIs are used to
   identify user accounts at a given host which are typically used for
   the purpose of resource management and establishing identity.  User
   accounts include a local identifier (username, screenname, or
   handle), and a host which can resolve and usually authenticate the
   local identifier.
