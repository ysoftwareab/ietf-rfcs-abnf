Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Foreign Agent function definied in the Mobile IP Protocol.

1.  The Network Management Framework

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

      STD 16/RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
      describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.  STD
      16/RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism, which is
      wholly consistent with the SMI.

      STD 17/RFC 1213 which defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
      objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

      STD 15/RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
      network access to managed objects.

      The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
      experimentation and evaluation.

2.  Objects

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [3]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

2.1.  Format of Definitions

Internet Draft          Mobile IP MIB Definition       December 18, 1995


   Section 4 contains the specification of all object types contained in
   this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the conventions
   defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [5,6].

3.  Overview

3.1.  Object Selection Criteria

   To be consistent with IAB directives and good engineering practice,
   the authors have applied some criteria to select managed objects for
   the Mobile IP Protocol.

      (1)  Partition management functionality among the Mobile Node,
      Home Agent, and Foreign Agent according to the partitioning seen
      in the Mobile IP Protocol. For example, the editors minimize the
      management requirements in the Mobile Node.

      (2)  Require that objects be essential for either fault or
      configuration management.

      (3)  Limit the total number of objects.

      (4)  Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in
      this or other MIBs.

3.2.  Structure of the Mobile IP

   This section describes the basic model of Mobile IP used in
   developing the Mobile IP MIB. This information should be useful to
   the implementor in understanding some of the basic design decisions
   of the MIB.

   The Mobile IP Protocol introduces these new funtional entities:

      Mobile Node

         A host or router that changes its point of attachment from one
         network or subnetwork to another.  A mobile node may change its
         location without losing connectivity and without changing its
         IP address.

      Home Agent

         A router on a mobile node's home network which tunnels packets
         for delivery to the mobile node when it is away from home, and
         maintains current location information for the mobile node.

      Foreign Agent

Internet Draft          Mobile IP MIB Definition       December 18, 1995


         A router on a mobile node's visited network which provides
         routing services to the mobile node when it registers.  The
         foreign agent detunnels and delivers packets to the mobile node
         that were tunneled by the mobile node's home agent.  In the
         reverse direction, the foreign agent may serve as a default
         router for registered mobile node.

   This document specifies the objects used in managing one of these
   entities; namely, the Mobile node.

3.3.  MIB Groups

   The definitions of managed objects for Mobile IP have been organized
   into several MIB groups:

      (1) The Mobile Node Group
      (2) The Foreign Agent Group
      (3) The Home Agent Group
      (4) The Security Group (Optional)

   The first three groups are related to the three entities defined in
   the Mobile IP Protocol specification. The Security Group is an
   optional group for all three entities, because it includes security
   configurations for each Mobile IP entity. If an agent seeking to
   implement the Mobile IP MIB does not support SNMPv2 with privacy, it
   is strongly advised that the Security Group not be implemented.

   This document specifies the Foreign Group.

5.  Acknowledgments

   This document was produced by the Mobile IP working group. The
   editors wish to thank Jim Solomon, for his encouragement, patience,
   and help. Thanks to Fredrick Tarberg and Fredrik Broman (KTH) for
   their initial efforts on MIB definitions. Thanks to Frank
   Kastenholz(FTP), for his comments on the initial MIB from KTH.

6.  Security Considerations

   The Mobile IP MIB affords the network operator the ability to
   configure and control the Mobile IP links of a particular system,
   including the Mobile IP authentication protocols, and shared secret
   key. This represents a security risk.

   These risks are addressed in the following manners:

      (1)  All variables which represent a significant security risk
           are placed in separate, optional, MIB Groups. As the MIB
           Group is the quantum of implementation within a MIB, the
           implementor of the MIB may elect not to implement these
           groups.

      (2)  The implementor may choose to implement the variables
           which present a security risk so that they may not be
           written, i.e., the variables are READ-ONLY. This method
           still presents a security risk, and is not recommended,

           in that the variables, specifically the Mobile IP Security
           Association variables, may be easily read.

      (3)  Using SNMPv2, the operator can place the variables into
           MIB views which are protected in that the parties which
           have access to those MIB views use authentication and
           privacy protocols, or the operator may elect to make
           these views not accessible to any party.  In order to
           facilitate this placement, all security-related variables
           are placed in separate MIB Tables. This eases the
           identification of the necessary MIB View Subtree.

      (4)  The Mobile IP Security MIB contains several objects which
           are very sensitive from a security point of view.

      Thus, in order to preserve the integrity, security and privacy of
      the Mobile IP security features, an implementation will allow
      access to this MIB only via SNMPv2 and then only for parties which
      are privacy enhanced.  Other access modes, e.g., SNMPv1 or SNMPv2
      without privacy-enhancement, are very dangerous and the security
      of the IP Mobility Support may be compromised. The other way to
      access this information is by use of SNMPv1 in concert with the IP
      security protocols (AH and ESP).  This can also be done in a
      secure fashion.
