Abstract

   The General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol
   specification supports two transport modes: UDP for very infrequent
   messaging, and TCP for all other cases.  However, with TCP comes
   certain undesirable features, e.g., head of line blocking, which
   affect performance when a number of sessions are multiplexed over the
   same TCP connection.  In certain environments and deployment
   scenarios, an unreliable, but still congestion controlled, transport
   would be needed.  This specification proposes DCCP as a transport

Internet-Draft           GIST over DCCP and DTLS               June 2007


1.  Introduction

   The NSIS protocol suite currently includes the General Internet
   Signaling Transport (GIST) [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp], and two NSIS
   Signaling Layer Protocols (NSLP) for NAT/Firewall configuration
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-nslp-natfw] and QoS signaling
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp].  GIST provides a uniform transport service
   to the NSLP layer, where these higher layer protocols can indicate
   the type of service they require from GIST, e.g., secure or unsecure,
   reliable or unreliable.  When GIST sets up Messaging Associations
   (MA) between nodes in the network, it can multiplex several sessions
   over one MA, provided that the transport characteristics requested by
   the NSLP protocols are met.

   Currently, GIST supports two transport protocols.  D-mode is run over
   UDP and because it lacks congestion control, it can only be used for
   infrequent messaging between nodes.  C-mode is run over TCP and
   provides a reliable congestion controlled service.  However, with TCP
   comes certain undesirable features, e.g., head of line blocking,
   which affect performance when a number of sessions are multiplexed
   over the same TCP connection.  If the first segment of a window of
   data is lost or delayed, TCP makes sure all data is still correctly
   received in order at the receiver.  This causes subsequent data to be
   delayed until the loss of a segment is recovered.  Thus, when GIST
   messages are multiplexed over the same MA, if a segment carrying a
   GIST message is lost in the beginning of the transmit window, all
   subsequent messages are delayed, too.  In certain environments and
   deployment scenarios, an unreliable, but still congestion controlled,
   transport would be needed.

   This specification proposes the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol
   (DCCP) [RFC4340] as a transport protocol for GIST.  DCCP enables
   congestion controlled and unreliable datagram service to the NSLP
   layer.  A further benefit of DCCP is that a new congestion control
   mechanism targeted to signaling transport can be designed and
   deployed for GIST in the future.  Also the work on DCCP Service Codes
   [I-D.fairhurst-dccp-serv-codes] can be used with this specification.

   This specification does not require any changes to the GIST or DCCP
   protocols.  We propose two new protocols to be used with GIST
   Messaging Associations:

   1.  Forwards-DCCP: for using DCCP in unsecure mode
   2.  Datagram Transport Layer Security

2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   All other terminology is taken from the GIST specification
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp].


3.  DCCP Transport for GIST

   Currently, the GIST specification supports Forwards-TCP and TLS.  The
   DCCP protocol is used with GIST in a similar way as TCP.  The
   querying node opens a forward connection towards the responder.
   Support for this protocol is OPTIONAL.

   If this protocol is offered, the MA-protocol-options data MUST also
   be carried in the Stack-Configuration-Data object.  The MA-protocol-
   options field formats are:

   1.  Query: no information apart from the field header.
   2.  Response: a 2 byte port number at which the connection will be
       accepted, followed by 2 padding bytes.

3.1.  MA Protocol Types

   We propose two new protocols to be used with GIST Messaging
   Associations:

   1.  Forwards-DCCP: for using DCCP in unsecure mode
   2.  Datagram Transport Layer Security

   The first protocol is meant to provide unsecure, unreliable, and
   congestion controlled transport service to NSLP applications.  The
   second protocol adds security, thus, providing secure, unreliable and
   congestion controlled service.  An NSLP layer protocol can indicate
   these preferences in the GIST API SendMessage primitive and the
   Transfer-Attributes parameters.

   Initially DTLS is used in conjunction with DCCP.  Support for this
   protocol in conjunction with DCCP is RECOMMENDED; associations using
   it can carry messages with transfer attributes requesting
   confidentiality and integrity protection.  The description of TLS
   usage in the GIST specification, Section 5.7.3.  [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp]
   apply also to DTLS.

3.2.  Bit-Level Formats

   The MA-protocol-options field in the Stack-Configuration-Data MUST be
   used with DCCP.  The responder indicates the port number where it
   will accept the DCCP connection.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not add new security considerations to what
   has already been raised in the GIST and DCCP protocols themselves.
   DCCP can use DTLS as specified in [I-D.ietf-dccp-dtls].


5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification requests IANA to allocate two new MA-Protocol-ID
   values
   o  Forwards-DCCP with a recommended value of 4.
   o  Datagram Transport Layer Security with a recommended value of 5.
