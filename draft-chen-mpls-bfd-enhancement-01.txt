Abstract 

   This document defines an enhancement to Bi-directional Forwarding 
   Detection (BFD) for MPLS LSPs [MPLS-BFD] that can be used to specify 
   the return path of BFD control packets for a specific BFD session. 
   Specifying co-routed or protected return path increases robustness 
   of BFD failure detection and reduces false positives. This document 
   also defines a way to avoid duplicate BFD sessions currently 
   encountered with Co-routed Bidirectional LSP and Associated 
   Bidirectional LSP. The enhancement halves the BFD sessions over 
   those LSPs, and allows a Co-routed Bidirectional LSPs or Associated 
   Bidirectional LSPs to be protected and switched as a single entity.

Internet-Draft        BFD for MPLS Enhancement              March 2010 
    

   the return path of BFD control packets for a specific BFD session. 
   In traffic engineered networks, LSPs usually do not follow IP 
   routing or there are multiple LSPs between same nodes. Specifying 
   return path to be congruent with forward path ensures that failures 
   in other paths (e.g. shortest path for IP routing) do not cause BFD 
   failure detection for the forward path. This extension hence 
   increases robustness of BFD based failure detection, especially in 
   LSP 1:1 type protection cases. Also specifying FRR protected LSP as 
   return path can increase robustness. 

   This document also defines a way to avoid duplicate BFD sessions 
   when BFD is used for Bidirectional LSP or for a pair of 
   unidirectional LSPs. This extension allows a Bidirectional LSP or a 
   pair of unidirectional LSPs to be protected and switched as a whole 
   entity.  

   In this document, term Bidirectional LSP includes Co-routed 
   Bidirectional LSP defined in [RFC 3471] [RFC 3473] and Associated 
   Bidirectional LSP (that is constructed from a pair of unidirectional 
   LSPs).  

2. Problem statements 

   BFD for MPLS LSPs (BFDoMPLS) is defined in [BFD-MPLS] and used for 
   detecting end-to-end reachability of LSP. BFD for MPLS is an 
   important feature for the packetized MPLS converged network, as it 
   provides end-to-end connectivity verification. Reverse direction of 
   MPLS for BFD follows routing, and hence it can not be used for 
   protection decisions, if more than one alternate path is available.  

   LSP Ping [RFC 4379] is used to bootstrap the BFD sessions. With the 
   current mechanisms defined in [BFD-MPLS]:  

     1. For each direction of a LSP, a separate BFD session is required 
        to be established. The return packets from the terminator of a 
        BFD session to the initiator could be either IP or MPLS 
        encapsulated, and the choice is of the terminator. That means 
        for unidirectional LSP, only one session is needed, but for a 
        Bidirectional LSP, there will be two BFD sessions. This will 
        result in not only doubling the BFD sessions over the LSP, but 
        sometimes failing to perform protection and switching when the 
        Bidirectional LSP is desired to be operated as a single entity. 
        This is due to the two BFD sessions that are individually 
        responsible for each direction of the Bidirectional LSP having 
        no inherent relationship.  It is possible that one session 
        detects failure and the other does not, with the result that

        one direction switches while the other does not. This can cause 
        unexpected operational problems. 

     2. For a specific BFD session, the return path (which carries the 
        BFD control packets), which could be an IP path or a LSP is 
        selected by the egress.  The choice is a local decision of the 
        egress, and egress does not have enough information to perform 
        a choice that would produce both directions of BFD transiting 
        same path. In some cases, it is very valuable to specify the 
        return path for a BFD session. For example, selecting a more 
        reliable return path (e.g., TE LSP with FRR protection) could 
        improve the reliability of reply BFD control packets or 
        selecting co-routed LSP would allow use of BFDoMPLS as trigger 
        for LSP protection. 

3. Enhancement to BFD for MPLS 

   The enhancement described in this document improves upon "BFD for 
   MPLS LSPs" [BFD-MPLS], in the following areas: 

     1. Allows LSP ingress node to signal the desired return path for 
        any BFDoMPLS session. 

     2. Allows operator to provision BFD on both forwarding and return 
        path of Bidirectional LSPs with a single BFD session. This 
        extension halves the number BFD sessions over the LSP, and 
        enables that a Bidirectional LSP could be protected and 
        switched as a single entity. 

     3. Allows operator to provision BFD on two unidirectional LSPs 
        (one for each direction) with a single BFD session. This 
        reduces number of BFD sessions, and hence reduces control plane 
        load. However in some cases (e.g. where make-before-break is 
        used or the operator wants each of the two unidirectional LSPs 
        to be operated separately), this is undesirable, and hence this 
        feature is optional. 

   All the goals listed above are only relevant to BFD session 
   establishment, so the enhancement defined in this document is mainly 
   focus on BFD session establishment. The "return path specified" 
   mechanisms defined in [LSP-PING-RP] are used in this document. 

4. Session Establishment 

   As defined in [BFD-MPLS], a BFD session is boot-strapped by LSP Ping.  
   All the procedures for session establishment defined in [BFD-MPLS] 

 
 
Chen, et al.          Expires September 5, 2010               [Page 4]

   apply here. In addition to that, a RP TLV defined in [LSP-PING-RP] 
   MUST be carried in the echo request. This is used to notify the 
   egress LSR to select the return path of the BFD session. The return 
   path is identified by the FEC sub-TLV encoded in the RP TLV.  

   Except for "Any Candidate sub-TLV" that is defined in [LSP-PING-RP], 
   any other sub-TLVs are applicable to be included in RP TLV to 
   explicitly specify the return path of a BFD session.  

   If RP TLV is present in LSP ping message that setups BFD for MPLS 
   sessions: 

     o LSP ping reply packet MUST be sent as specified in [LSP-PING-RP]. 

     o BFD for MPLS packets MUST be sent via same reply channel used 
        for LSP ping reply packets. 

     o If selected path becomes unavailable (and no other path meeting 
        specifications in previously received RP TLV is present), 
        transmission of BFD packets MUST be interrupted. Transmission 
        of BFD packets MUST resume, if return path LSP becomes 
        available. 

   It is permissible for multiple BFD for MPLS sessions to use same 
   return path -- when node does make-before-break (MBB), it can signal 
   separate BFD for MPLS session to test new LSP before taking it into 
   use. 

   In this document, a new TLV, Session Control TLV is defined. Session 
   Control TLV is used to notify the egress LSR whether to establish 
   another BFD session for the backward direction of a Bidirectional 
   LSP or a pair of unidirectional LSPs (one for each direction). If 
   Session Control TLV is carried, the egress LSR MUST not initiate 
   another separate BFD session for the backward direction of the 
   Bidirectional LSP or the pair of unidirectional LSPs. If BFD session 
   has been provisioned to both nodes, the node with a numerically 
   larger IP address (comparison using signaled LSP endpoint addresses, 
   for example, the terminator could use its own Router ID for 
   comparison with the source IP address of the received echo request.) 
   shall initiate signaling. The initiator MAY carry an IP address 
   (e.g., Router ID) of its own in the Source Address TLV [MPLS-TP-TLV] 
   when IP forwarding is disabled (e.g., the scenario of MPLS-TP 
   without IP forwarding). If node with the larger IP receives LSP ping 
   message signaling BFD session with Session Control TLV, LSP ping 
   reply must be transmitted with "Backward direction BFD session 
   exists" to the ingress LSR. If there is no Session Control TLV

Internet-Draft        BFD for MPLS Enhancement              March 2010 
    

   carried in the echo request, it's up to the egress LSR to decide 
   whether to initiate another BFD session for the backward direction 
   LSP, this is the same as the definition in [BFD-MPLS].  

   When received an echo request with the reply mode set to "Reply via 
   specified path" [LSP-PING-RP], if the receiver does not know the 
   reply mode, an echo reply with the return code set to "Malformed 
   echo request" and the Subcode set to zero SHOULD be send back to the 
   initiator. The BFD session will not be established in this case. 

   When provisioning a single BFD to a bidirectional LSP or a pair of 
   unidirectional LSPs, in case of the forwarding direction of session 
   is OK but the reverse direction is not, the initiator MUST not send 
   BFD control packets on the session until the echo reply is received 
   from the terminator. And the terminator MUST not send BFD control 
   packets onto the BFD session until the first BFD control packet is 
   received from the initiator. 

4.1. Session Control TLV 

   Session Control TLV is an optional TLV, it is carried in echo 
   request to notify the egress LSR not to initiate another BFD session 
   for the backward direction of a Bidirectional LSP or pair of 
   unidirectional LSPs (one for each direction). The format of Session 
   Control TLV is as follows: 

   0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |     Session Control Type      |          Length               |  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
            
   The Session Control TLV Type field is 2 octets in length, and the 
   type value is TBD. 

   Length field is 2 octets in length, the value of length field SHOULD 
   be 0, unless any sub-TLVs (defined in future) are present. 

4.2. The usage of IPv4/IPv6 RSVP Tunnel sub-TLVs 

   IPv4/IPv6 RSVP Tunnel sub-TLVs are defined in [LSP-PING-RP], which 
   are used to notify the egress LSR of a specific LSP how to choose 
   the return path for an echo reply. 

   In this document, these sub-TLVs are re-used to notify the egress 
   LSR of a specific LSP how to choose the return path of a BFD session.

Internet-Draft        BFD for MPLS Enhancement              March 2010 
    

   As stated in section 2 of this document, it is possible to have 
   multiple parallel LSPs between the ingress and egress LSRs.  In a 
   typical network example, a group of parallel LSPs have the same 
   tunnel ID but different LSP IDs. There is one primary and one or 
   more secondary LSPs in each direction. When establishing a BFD 
   session for an LSP, it is common for the primary LSP to choose the 
   primary as the return path and the secondary LSP to choose the 
   secondary as the return path. With the IPv4/IPv6 Tunnel sub-TLVs, 
   operators don't have to specify a specific return LSP. They just 
   need to specify from which tunnel the return LSP should be chosen, 
   and specify the type (e.g., primary or secondary) of the return LSP. 
   The egress LSR will then choose the proper return path.  

   Use of IPv4/IPv6 RSVP Tunnel sub-TLVs permits MBB on return path of 
   BFD session. If a specific RSVP session would be selected (with FEC 
   containing LSP ID), return path would be interrupted if egress node 
   would do MBB for the return path. This is due to the fact that MBB 
   is based on signaling new LSP with different LSP ID and then 
   deleting old LSP - after MBB selected return path would no longer be 
   available. MBB is common occurrence as it is often used for changing 
   LSP attributes, such as reserved bandwidth. With the extensions in 
   [LSP-PING-RP], desired LSP can be selected without limiting use of 
   MBB. 
    

5. Encapsulation  

   In this document, since the BFD control packet from the session 
   terminator to initiator MUST be encapsulated in a MPLS label stack, 
   it MUST have a well known destination port 3784 [BFD-IP]. 

6. Security Considerations 

   Security considerations discussed in [BFD-MPLS], [BFD], [BFD-MHOP] 
   and [RFC4379] apply to this document. 

   Limitations on permitted return path LSPs specified [LSP-PING-RP] 
   apply to extensions specified in this document.  

7. IANA Considerations 

   IANA is requested to make the following allocations from registries 
   under its control.

     7.1. Return code 

   IANA is requested to assign a new return code as follows: 

       Type #                  Value Field 
       ------                  ----------- 
           11                  Backward direction session exists 
    

     7.2. Session Control TLV 

   IANA is requested to assign a new TLV type (TBD) from the range of 
   0-16383. We suggest that the value 21 be assigned for the new RP TLV 
   type. 

       Type    Value Field 
      -----    ----------- 
         21    Session Control
