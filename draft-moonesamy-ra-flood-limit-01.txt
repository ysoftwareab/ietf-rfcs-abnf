         Mitigation against IPv6 Router Advertisements flooding
                   draft-moonesamy-ra-flood-limit-01


Abstract

   An IPv6 Router Advertisements flooding attack can cause a node to
   consume all CPU resources available making the system unusable and
   unresponsive. This document recommends some configurable variables as
   a mitigation against an IPv6 Router Advertisements flooding attack.

INTERNET DRAFT    IPv6 Router Advertisements flooding  December 19, 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Neighbor Discovery protocol [RFC4861] describes the operation of
   IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs) that are used to determine node
   configuration information during the IPv6 autoconfiguration process. 
   A Router Advertisements flooding attack [RAFLOOD] can cause a node to
   consume all CPU resources available or cause kernel memory exhaustion
   making the system unusable and unresponsive.  The problem with rogue
   IPv6 Router Advertisement is documented in RFC 6104 [RFC6104].

   This document recommends some configurable variables as a mitigation
   against a Router Advertisements flooding attack.  

2.  Router Advertisement Configuration Variables

   A host will silently discard a Router Advertisement once the
   configurable limit is reached.  Default values are specified to make
   it unnecessary to configure any of these variables.

2.1 MaxInterfacePrefixes

   This variable is the maximum number of prefixes created per interface
   by Router Advertisements.

   Default: 16

2.2. MaxInterfaceRouters

   This variable is the maximum number of default routers created per
   interface by Route Advertisements.

   Default: 16

2.3. MaxRedirect

   This variable is the maximum number of dynamic routes created via
   ICMPv6 Redirect messages.

   Default: 4096


3.  Security Considerations

   The Router Advertisements flooding attack can cause a denial-of-
   service.  The configuration variables described in this document can
   be used to limit the scope of the attack.  There is a high
   probability that valid Router Advertisement information may be lost
   even with the mitigation described in this document.  It is

   reached.

   flooding attack in 2011.  The authors would like to thank David
