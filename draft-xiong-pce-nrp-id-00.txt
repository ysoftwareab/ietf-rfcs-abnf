1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)
   which is used between a Path Computation Element (PCE) and a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) (or other PCE) to enable computation of
   Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) for Traffic Engineering Label
   Switched Path (TE LSP).  PCEP Extensions for the Stateful PCE Model
   [RFC8231] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable active
   control of MPLS-TE and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) tunnels.  As depicted
   in [RFC4655], a PCE MUST be able to compute the path of a TE LSP by
   operating on the TED and considering bandwidth and other constraints
   applicable to the TE LSP service request.  The constraint parameters
   are provided such as metric, bandwidth, delay, affinity, etc.
   However these parameters can't meet the network slicing requirements.

   According to 5G context, network slicing is the collection of a set
   of technologies to support network service differentiation and
   meeting the diversified requirements from vertical industries.  IETF
   Network Slice is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition].  The slices may be
   viewed as virtual networks and partition the network resources into
   sub-topologies in transport network.  Slice Aggregate is a a
   collection of packets that match a slice policy selection criteria
   and are given the same forwarding treatment as defined in
   [I-D.bestbar-teas-ns-packet].  And Network Resource Partition is the
   collection of resources that are used to support a slice aggregate.
   The identifier of Network Resource Partition (NRP-ID) could be used
   to identify the slice and network resource and viewed as constraints
   of network slicing when PCE is deployed.  PCE MUST take the
   identifier of slicing into consideration during path computation.

   This document proposes a set of extensions for PCEP to support the
   NRP-ID as the constraint of network slicing during path computation.

2.  Conventions used in this document

2.1.  Terminology

   The terminology is defined as [RFC5440] and
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition].

2.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  PCEP Extensions for Network Resource Partition

   As defined in [RFC5440] , the LSPA object is used to specify the LSP
   attributes to be taken into account by the PCE during path
   computation such as constraints.  This document proposes new TLV for
   the LSPA object to carry TE constraints in Network Slicing.

3.1.  NRP-ID TLV

   The NRP-ID TLV is optional and is defined to carry the slice specific
   constraint.  PCEP message needs to carry NRP-ID to let the scope of
   path calculation to be limited in a specific network resources
   partition.

   There are many control plane technologies to realize network slice.
   Some control plane technologies may directly maintain resources per
   slice granularity in the link-state database, only for the case with
   small slice scalability.  [I-D.bestbar-teas-ns-packet] proposes a
   more scalable slicing scheme.  The resource information in link-state
   database is identified by NRP-ID to distinguish the logical
   topologies corresponding to different slice-aggregate.  Within the
   controller, a slice-aggregate includes one or more slices mapped to
   it.  If the number of slices is small, the resources per slice
   granularity can be maintained directly in the link-state database.
   In this case, different slice may be mapped to different slice-
   aggregate.  If the number of slices is large, it is not recommended
   to maintain the slice granularity resources in the link-state
   database, but the aggregated granularity.

Internet-Draft          PCEP Extension for NRP-ID          November 2021


   It is required to define a NRP-ID constraint in the TE purpose
   definition of overlay service.  For example, VPN routes may have
   Color attribute (refer to [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps] and
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy]).  Color represents
   aspecific TE purpose, which can contain an NRP-ID.

   When the controller receives the path computation request with a NRP-
   ID constraint, it can use the resources identified by specific NRP-ID
   in TED to calculate the path.  PCE may maintain resources per path
   within the resource pool identified by NRP-ID.

   In a PCReq message, a PCC MAY insert one NRP-ID TLV to indicate the
   slice based virtual network that MUST be considered by the PCE.  The
   PCE will perform path computation based on the intra-domain or inter-
   domain sub-topology identified by the specific NRP-ID, that can be
   used to find the corresponding customized topology or referenced
   topology, and corresponding resources.

   In a PCRep/PCInit/PCUpd message, the NRP-ID TLV MAY be carried so as
   to provide the network slicing information for the computed path.
   The headend may put the NRP-ID, or other information that can be
   deduced to a NRP-ID, to an encapsulated data packet.

   The format of the NRP-ID TLV is shown as Figure 1:


       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                       Figure 1: Figure 1: NRP-ID TLV


   The code point for the TLV type is TBD1.  The TLV length is 4 octets.

   NRP-ID (32 bits): indicates the identifier of Network Resource
   Partition to represent an IETF Network Slice that is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition].
