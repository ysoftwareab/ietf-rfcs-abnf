  IEEE802.15.4 Informational Element encapsulation of 6tisch Join and
                         Enrollment Information
            draft-ietf-6tisch-enrollment-enhanced-beacon-05

Abstract

   In TSCH mode of IEEE STD 802.15.4 opportunities for broadcasts are
   limited to specific times and specific channels.  Nodes in a TSCH
   network typically frequently send Enhanced Beacon (EB) frames to
   announce the presence of the network.  This document provides a
   mechanism by which small details critical for new nodes (pledges) and
   long sleeping nodes may be carried within the Enhanced Beacon.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7554] describes the use of the time-slotted channel hopping
   (TSCH) mode of [ieee802154].  As further details in [RFC8180], an
   Enhanced Beacon is transmitted during a slot designated a broadcast
   slot.

1.1.  Use of BCP 14 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [BCP14] [RFC2119] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals,
   as shown here.

   Other terminology can be found in [I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture] in
   section 2.1.

1.2.  Layer-2 Synchronization

   As explained in section 6 of [RFC8180], the Enhanced Beacon has a
   number of purposes: synchronization of ASN and Join Metric, timeslot
   template identifier, the channel hopping sequence identifier, TSCH
   SlotFrame and Link IE.

   The Enhanced Beacon (EB) is used by nodes already part of a TSCH
   network to annouce its existance.  Receiving an EB allows a Joining

Internet-Draft                IE for ICMPv6               September 2019


   Node (pledge) to learn about the network and synchronize to it.  The
   EB may also be used as a means for a node already part of the network
   to re-synchronize [RFC7554].

   There are a limited number of timeslots designated as a broadcast
   slot by each router.  These slots are rare, and with 10ms slots, with
   a slot-frame length of 100, there may be only 1 slot/s for the
   beacon.

1.3.  Layer-3 synchronization IPv6 Router solicitations and
      advertisements

   At layer 3, [RFC4861] defines a mechanism by which nodes learn about
   routers by listening for multicasted Router Advertisements (RA).  If
   no RA is heard within a set time, then a Router Solicitation (RS) may
   be multicast, to which an RA will be received, usually unicast.

   Although [RFC6775] reduces the amount of multicast necessary to do
   address resolution via Neighbor Solicitation messages, it still
   requires multicast of either RAs or RS.  This is an expensive
   operation for two reasons: there are few multicast timeslots for
   unsolicited RAs; if a pledge node does not hear an RA, and decides to
   send a RS (consuming a broadcast aloha slot with unencrypted
   traffic), unicast RS may be sent in response.

   This is a particularly acute issue for the join process for the
   following reasons:

   1.  use of a multicast slot by even a non-malicious unauthenticated
       node for a Router Solicitation may overwhelm that time slot.

   2.  it may require many seconds of on-time before a new pledge hears
       a Router Soliciation that it can use.

   3.  a new pledge may listen to many Enhanced Beacons before it can
       pick an appropriate network and/or closest Join Assistant to
       attach to.  If it must listen for a RS as well as find the
       Enhanced Beacon, then the process may take a very long time.

2.  Protocol Definition

   [RFC8137] creates a registry for new IETF IE subtypes.  This document
   allocates a new subtype.

   The new IE subtype structure is as follows.  As explained in
   [RFC8137] the length of the Sub-Type Content can be calculated from
   the container, so no length information is necessary.

   proxy priority  this field indicates the willingness to act as join
      proxy.  Lower value indicates willing to act as a Join Proxy as
      described in [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security].  Values range 0
      (most willing) to 0x7e (least willing).  A priority of 0x7f
      indicates that the announcer should never be considered as a
      viable enrollment proxy.  Only unenrolled pledges look at this
      value.

   pan priority  the pan priority is a value set by the DODAG root to
      indicate the relative priority of this LLN compared to those with
      different PANIDs.  This value may be used as part of the
      enrollment priority, but typically is used by devices which have
      already enrolled, and need to determine which PAN to pick.
      Unenrolled pledges MAY consider this value when selecting a PAN to
      join.  Enrolled devices MAY consider this value when looking for
      an eligible parent device.

   rank priority  the rank "priority" is set by the 6LR which sent the
      beacon and is an indication of how willing this 6LR is to serve as
      an RPL parent within a particular network ID.  This is a local
      value to be determined in other work.  It might be calculated from
      RPL rank, and it may include some modifications based upon current
      number of children, or number of neighbor cache entries available.
      This value MUST be ignored by pledges, it is for enrolled devices
      only.

   R  the Router Advertisement R-flag is set if the sending node will
      act as a Router for host-only nodes that need addressing via
      unicast Router Solicitation messages.

   P  if the Proxy Address P-flag is set, then the lower 64-bits of the
      Join Proxy's Link Layer address follows the network ID.  If the
      Proxy Address bit is not set, then the Link Layer address of the
      Join Proxy is identical to the Layer-2 8-byte address used to
      originate this enhanced beacon.  In either case, the layer-2
      address of any IPv6 traffic to the originator of this beacon may
      use the layer-2 address which was used to originate the beacon.

   join-proxy interface ID  if the P bit is set, then 64 bits (8 bytes)
      of address are present.  This field provides the suffix of the
      Link-Local address of the Join Proxy.  The associated prefix is
      well-known as fe80::/64.

   network ID  this is an variable length field, up to 16-bytes in size
      that uniquely identifies this network, potentially among many
      networks that are operating in the same frequencies in overlapping
      physical space.  The length of this field can be calculated as
      being whatever is left in the Information Element.

   In a 6tisch network, where RPL [RFC6550] is used as the mesh routing
   protocol, the network ID can be constructed from a SHA256 hash of the
   prefix (/64) of the network.  That is just a suggestion for a default
   value.  In some LLNs where multiple PANIDs may lead to the same
   management device (the JRC), then a common value that is the same
   across all PANs MUST be configured.

3.  Security Considerations

   All of the contents of this Information Element are sent in the
   clear.  The containing Enhanced Beacon is not encrypted.

   The Enhanced Beagon is authenticated at the layer-2 level using
   802.15.4 mechanisms using the network-wide keying material.  Nodes
   which are enrolled will have the network-wide keying material and can
   validate the beacon.

   Pledges which have not yet enrolled are unable to authenticate the
   beacons.

4.  Privacy Considerations

   The use of a network ID may reveal information about the network.
   The use of a SHA256 hash of the DODAGID, rather than using the
   DODAGID directly provides some cover the addresses used within the

   network.  The DODAGID is usually the IPv6 address of the root of the
   RPL mesh.

   An interloper with a radio sniffer would be able to use the network
   ID to map out the extend of the mesh network.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Allocate a new number TBD-XXX from Registry IETF IE Sub-type ID.
   This entry should be called 6tisch-Join-Info, and should refer to
   this document.
