             What To Do With Multiple Active Paths in QUIC
            draft-dawkins-quic-what-to-do-with-multipath-02

Abstract

   The IETF QUIC working group has been chartered to produce extensions
   that would "enable ... multipath capabilities" since the working
   group was formed in 2016, but because multipath was an extension,
   work on multipath, and the other extensions named in the charter,
   waited while work proceeded on the core QUIC protocol specifications.

   After the QUIC working group chairs requested publication for the
   core QUIC protocol specifications, they scheduled a virtual interim
   meeting to understand the use cases that various groups inside and
   outside the IETF were envisioning for multipath with QUIC.

   As part of that discussion, it became obvious that people had a
   variety of ideas about how multiple paths would be used, because they
   weren't looking at the same use cases.

   This document is intended to capture that variety of ideas, to inform
   further discussion in the working group.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF QUIC working group has been chartered to produce extensions
   that would "enable ... multipath capabilities" ([QUIC-charter]) since
   the working group was formed in 2016, but because multipath was an
   extension, work on multipath, and the other extensions named in the
   charter, waited while work proceeded on the core QUIC protocol
   specifications ([I-D.ietf-quic-transport] and related
   specifications).

   After the QUIC working group chairs requested publication for the
   core QUIC protocol specifications, they scheduled a virtual interim
   meeting ([QUIC-interim-20-10]) to understand the use cases that
   various groups inside and outside the IETF were envisioning for
   multipath with QUIC.

   As part of that discussion, it became obvious that people had a
   variety of ideas about how multiple paths would be used, because they
   weren't looking at the same use cases.  From an architectural point
   of view, two main multipath scenarios emerged.  The first scenario
   was envisioned by people who were focused on end-to-end service, and
   the second scenario was envisioned by people who expected some sort
   of (explicit) intermediary, such as a transport proxy or tunnel
   endpoint, between the ultimate endpoints.

   This document is intended to capture that variety of ideas, to inform
   further discussion in the working group.

   For more details, please see the QUIC working group meeting minutes,
   at [QUIC-interim-20-10-minutes], which include pointers to the video
   recording from the meeting, pointers to each presentation given,
   questions and answers after each presentation, and overall discussion
   following the presentations.

1.1.  Other Voices

   This document grew out of discussions in the QUIC working group, but
   there are other efforts working on multipath in both the IETF and the
   IRTF, and their work includes mentions of strategies for using
   multiple paths.  I'll add this work as I find it, if that work is
   proposing a strategy that hasn't been mentioned in the QUIC
   discussion.  In particular, strategies named in
   [I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers] have been included in Section 2.3,
   in the current version of the draft.

2.  Multipath Modes of Operation

   For the purposes of this document, it's enough to consider two QUIC
   endpoints (QUIC Host X and QUIC Host Y) with two disjoint paths
   between them (Access Net A and Access Net B), as shown in Figure 1.

      Figure 1: Simplified Reference Architecture for QUIC Multipath
                                 Operation

   Some use cases limit themselves to two paths - for example, the use
   case described in [I-D.bonaventure-quic-atsss-overview] is limited to
   one 5G 3GPP access network and one non-3GPP access network.  More
   than two paths are certainly possible - for example, two hosts that
   are connected by a satellite path, and two different landline paths
   from different network providers for redundancy.  But I believe this
   simplified architecture is sufficient for discussion purposes.

   Please note: as mentioned in Section 1, some readers will be thinking
   of an end-to-end QUIC connection between QUIC Host X and QUIC Host Y
   in Figure 1, while other readers will be thinking of QUIC Host Y as
   some sort of (explicit) transport proxy or tunnel endpoint, e.g.
   [I-D.bonaventure-quic-atsss-overview].  This document is only focused
   on the multiple paths between QUIC Host X and QUIC Host Y, in order
   to talk about classes of sending and strategies for sending over
   multiple paths.  However, it might be that further implications arose
   from the motivation of end-to-end multipath or intermediary
   multipath.  In particular the latter will additionally require,
   according to [I-D.bonaventure-quic-atsss-overview], QUIC datagram
   (unreliable transport) and tunneling support.  While multipath
   traffic distribution strategies play a central role in multipath
   transport, multipath re-ordering strategies become additionally
   important for multipath over unreliable network protocols.  Possible
   strategies to solve this are described in
   [I-D.amend-iccrg-multipath-reordering].  Another complexitiy, not in
   scope of this document, is the interaction between multipath
   scheduling and QUIC stream traffic scheduling.

2.2.  Sending When Multiple Paths Are Available

   This section uses terminology from 3GPP ATSSS {Access Traffic
   Steering, Switch and Splitting, [TS23501]) to describe three
   different classes of packet sending that could be used when multiple
   disjoint paths are available.  Note that these terms describe
   concepts that are not ATSSS-specific, and could apply to any
   multipath environment.  If terminology more accessible to IETF QUIC
   working group participants presents itself, I'll change it.

   Please note that the relationship between "flows", "packets", and
   "datagrams" isn't entirely clear yet.  In [TS23501], a "flow" is
   defined as "a set of packets that share an ordering constraint",
   which maps reasonably well onto TCP bytestreams and correspondingly
   onto MP-TCP bytestreams, but the core QUIC transport mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] provides multiple bytesteams in a single
   connection, and leveraging QUIC streams seems to be a use case
   enabler, whether for redundantly sending overlapping ranges, for
   efficiently striping non-overlapping ranges for bandwidth, or for
   strict ordering.

   Further, with the QUIC datagram extension [I-D.ietf-quic-datagram],
   DATAGRAM frames can be carried in a QUIC connection, but are not part
   of a stream and do not interact with in-order delivery within a
   stream.

2.2.1.  Traffic Steering

   When a sending host has a new "flow", and has more than one path
   available, a sending host will select a path to begin sending packets
   on.  This can be described as Traffic Steering.

   Note that the selection of a path is "per-flow".  Different flows may
   be steered onto different paths, but each flow will be sent on a
   single path.

   The choice of a path can be based on a number of factors - for
   instance, whether the path will be used for bulk transfer, or whether
   an unmetered path is available.  Those factors are important, but for
   this document, the point is that a path is selected.

2.2.2.  Traffic Switching

   When a sending host has more than one path available and is sending a
   flow on a single path, the sending host can stop using this path for
   this flow, and start using another path.  This can be described as
   Traffic Switching.

Internet-Draft       What To Do With QUIC Multipath        November 2020


   Note that the selection of another path is also per-flow.  A sender
   can switch a flow onto a different path, without switching any other
   flows to that path.

2.2.3.  Traffic Splitting

   When a sending host has more than one path available, the sending
   host may wish to use multiple paths simultaneously for a single flow.
   This can be described as Traffic Splitting.

   Note that splitting a flow onto multiple paths means that the sending
   decision would be made on a packet-by-packet basis.  No guarantee of
   packet ordering across paths is assumed.

   Note that splitting a flow onto multiple paths, packet by packet,
   means that any ordering constraint must be provided by an upper layer
   metchanism.  In [TS23501], Multipath TCP [RFC8684] is used to provide
   that ordering constraint.

2.2.4.  Traffic Steering, Traffic Switching, and Traffic Splitting in
        the Core QUIC Transport Protocol and Datagram Extension

   [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] and related specifications support the
   selection and use of multiple paths for a connection between QUIC
   endpoints, as long as only one path is in active use at any given
   time.  [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] and related specifications do not
   support sending traffic for a single connection on multiple paths
   between QUIC endpoints simultaneously.

   This level of support for multipath allows Traffic Steering - the
   selection of a specific path - and Traffic Switching - migration of
   traffic from one path to another, using QUIC connection migration.
   It does not allow "Traffic Splitting" - the use of simultaneous paths
   for a single connection.

   One important output from the QUIC interim meeting was the
   recognition that some participants view "Traffic Switching" as
   something like "protection switching" from an active path to a
   standby path, that doesn't happen often, while other participants
   view QUIC connection migration as a way of responding frequently to
   changing path conditions.  This will be an important part of the
   conversation about multipath QUIC.

   If a QUIC endpoint opens and validates two or more connections, no
   additional setup or signaling is required for a sender to switch
   paths - that can begin with the next packet queued for transmission.
   This would allow "Traffic Splitting" for unordered QUIC DATAGRAMs

   [I-D.ietf-quic-datagram], with an upper-layer mechanism providing
   flow ordering if that is needed.

2.3.  Sending Strategies with Multiple Paths

   During the QUIC virtual interim meeting, various presenters described
   various sending strategies that they have used in the past
   (especially with TCP [RFC0793] and Multipath TCP [RFC8684]). and that
   they expected to use in the future with some multipath QUIC
   extension.

   This section is an attempt to identify commonalities and gaps that
   may inform work on future multipath extensions for QUIC.

   All of these sending strategies build on Traffic Steering - opening
   one or more connections for a new flow, and then proceeding to use
   one connection, switch to another connection, or split traffic across
   paths.  For this reason, Traffic Steering isn't mentioned in the rest
   of this section.

2.3.1.  Active-Standby

   The traffic associated with a specific flow will be sent via a
   specific path (the 'active path') and switched to another path
   (called 'standby path') when the active access is unavailable.
   Traffic Switching is sufficient to support this strategy.
   [Alibaba-MPQUIC] and [Multipath-3GPP-ATSSS] mentioned this strategy
   at the QUIC Interim meeting.

2.3.2.  Trading Latency Versus Bandwidth

   Some applications require low latency, and others don't.  So using a
   network path with lower latency for some connections, and using a
   different network path with higher bandwidth available for others.
   allows this strategy.  Traffic Switching is sufficient for this, if
   measured path characteristics change enough to justify changing
   paths.  [Chromium-Multipath] mentioned this strategy at the QUIC
   Interim Meeting.  [Apple-Multipath] is actually switching paths at
   sub-RTT rates.

2.3.3.  Bandwidth Aggregation/Load Balancing

   Some environments allow the use of multiple paths simultaneously for
   significant periods of time, because none of the paths are metered,
   so using all of the bandwidth on all of the paths simultaneously
   makes sense for bulk transfers.  Traffic Splitting is required to
   support this strategy.  [Alibaba-MPQUIC], [Hybrid-Access-Multipath],
   [Sat-Terr-Multipath], and [Multipath-3GPP-ATSSS] all mentioned this



Dawkins                   Expires May 24, 2021                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       What To Do With QUIC Multipath        November 2020


   strategy at the QUIC Interim Meeting.
   [I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers] mentions this strategy as "Round-
   Robin" (not recommended) and "Weighted Round-Robin".

2.3.4.  Round-Trip-Time Thresholds, Minimum RTT Difference, and RTT
        Equivalence

   Not all multipath environments include paths with significant
   differences between path characteristics, but several do.

   A sender might select the first available path with a smoothed round-
   trip-time below a certain threshold.  The goal is to keep the RTT of
   the multipath connection to a small value and avoid having the whole
   connection impacted by "bad" paths.
   [I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers] mentions this strategy as "Round-
   Trip-Time Threshold".

   A sender might select the path with the lowest RTT among all
   available paths, in order to minimize latency for latency-sensitive
   flows.  [I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers] mentions this strategy as
   "Lowest Round-Trip-Time First".

   If two or more paths have characteristics that are "sufficiently
   close" - for example, they may have path RTTs that are equivalent,
   from the application's point of view - a sender may wish to use both
   paths as long as that's the case, and then adopt another sending
   strategy when measured path characteristics diverge.  Traffic
   Splitting is required to support this strategy.  [Apple-Multipath],
   [Sat-Terr-Multipath].[Hybrid-Access-Multipath], and
   [Multipath-3GPP-ATSSS] all mentioned this strategy at the QUIC
   Interim Meeting.

2.3.5.  Priority-based

   Paths are assigned priority levels that indicate which path will be
   used first.  Concretely, the traffic associated with the matching
   flow will be steered on the path with a high priority till congestion
   is detected, then the overflow will be sent over a low priority
   access.  Traffic Splitting is required to support this strategy.
   [Multipath-3GPP-ATSSS] mentioned this strategy at the QUIC Interim
   meeting.

2.3.6.  Redundant

   Traffic is replicated over two or more paths to increase the
   probability that the traffic will arrive at the other host undamaged
   and usable.  Redundant traffic may be used for all packets in a
   connection, or may only be used when measured network conditions

   indicate it should be used.  Traffic Splitting is required to support
   this strategy.  [Apple-Multipath] and [Multipath-3GPP-ATSSS]
   mentioned this strategy at the QUIC Interim meeting.

2.3.7.  Combinations of Strategies

   As [I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers] points out, a scheduler can use
   a combination of strategies in sending decisions.  For example, a
   scheduler might use load-balancing over three paths, but when one of
   the paths becomes unavailable, might switch to the two paths that are
   still available.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not make any request to IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   QUIC-specific security considerations are discussed in Section 21 of
   [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].

   Section 6 of [I-D.ietf-quic-datagram] discusses security
   considerations specific to the use of the Unreliable Datagram
   Extension to QUIC.

   Some multipath QUIC-specific security considerations can be found in
   Section 8 of the individual draft [I-D.deconinck-quic-multipath].
