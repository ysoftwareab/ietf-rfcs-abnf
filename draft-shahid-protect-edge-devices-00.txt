             Ingress filtering by using Wildcard mask bits
                  draft-shahid-protect-edge-devices-00

Abstract

   Security of the IP Network is always one of the primary concerns of
   the network design and normally used layered approach.  It is
   recommended not to rely on a single layer of defense, but to
   configure multi-layer security measures.

   The primary purpose of this paper is to propose a simple and
   effective solution to enhance the security of EDGE devices which are
   connected to external users in a Service Provider network.  Most
   Service Providers commonly use ingress filtering as one of the
   methods to filter traffic to secure edge devices of their
   infrastructure from external users.  The proposed technique will use
   a special wildcard mask on the network addresses to limit the
   accessibility of the Service Provider EDGE devices from external
   users.  This will greatly enhance the security of the Service
   Provider's edge devices from malicious attacks such as Denial of
   Service (DoS).

1.  Introduction

   Security of the IP Network is always one of the main objectives of
   the network design.  For better security, it is always recommended to
   configure multi-layer security measures and not to rely on a single
   layer of defense.

   First layer of defense is network inaccessibility which can be
   achieved by two methods:

   1.  Do not advertise the internal infrastructure IP to External users

   2.  Apply ingress policies at the perimeter of the network to block
   any traffic destined for internal infrastructure devices

   In a Service Provider (SP) environment, there are two types of
   infrastructure devices in terms of layer 3 connectivity i.e.
   INTERNAL and EXTERNAL devices.  All interfaces of the INTERNAL
   devices remain inside of the SP network and external users connect to
   the EXTERNAL or EDGE devices of the SP network.



                                                CE2 (External User 2)
                                                        /
                                                       /
                                                      /
      SP EDGE device#1<-->SP INTERNAL device<--->SP EDGE device#2
        \
         \
          \
           CE1 (External User 1)




   If the Service Provider is using a separate block of address space
   for INTERNAL connectivity, then it is simple to block all packets at
   the perimeter of the network and prevent the packets from reaching
   the Service Providers INTERNAL infrastructure devices.  There are
   some challenges to secure the EDGE devices if the EXTERNAL address
   space is accessible from external networks and external users.

   To secure EDGE devices, the proposed technique uses ingress filtering
   method which is very common within SP's to secure infrastructure
   devices.  The basic requirement of the proposed technique is to use
   separate address space for INTERNAL and EDGE devices.

   Generally, the EXTERNAL address space is totally blocked from
   external networks and users to secure EDGE devices with few
   exceptions of directly connected devices.  But some Service Providers
   make the external addresses of edge devices reachable from external
   source due to multiple reasons.

   One of the methods used by SP is to block the entire EXTERNAL address
   space from external users with few exceptions with directly connected
   devices at layer 3 IP protocol, for example, routing information
   needs to be exchanged with the directly connected edge device.
   Second exception is to allow ICMP packets to check the reachability
   for operational considerations to determine the state of the router
   interface.  Since the whole EXTERNAL address space is blocked at the
   perimeter of the network, separate LAN IP is provided to external
   user to establish communication with other users and networks.
   Furthermore, this results to an unnecessary allocation of routable IP
   addresses and contributing towards the depletion of the IPv4
   allocation pool.

   In the second scenario, some Service Providers open the EXTERNAL
   address space for external networks and users, and allow
   communication on the point-to-point IP at the cost of increased
   visibility of EDGE devices.  The drawback of using the above method
   will be to make the EDGE devices more prone to attacks.  But at the
   same time this will eliminate the unnecessary use of extra LAN IP
   addresses if customer can use NAT over the WAN IP addresses.  It is
   very important to save routable IP addresses without compromising the
   EDGE device security for DOS and different type of attacks.

2.  Proposed Solution

   An effective solution to overcome the limitations and disadvantages
   of the above scenarios is to use wildcard mask bits.

   In case of subnet mask of /30 (255.255.255.252), first usable IP is
   always be an ODD number (1,5,9,13 and so on) and second useable IP
   will be EVEN.  External users and networks uses the IP from the
   EXTERNAL block to connect with the Service Providers EDGE devices.
   But External users and networks can only reach and access other
   External users and networks but not the Service Providers EDGE
   devices, which is using the same EXTERNAL address space, with the
   minor exceptions of directly connected device.  To be able to satisfy
   this requirement, the following set of policies should be in place
   for the IP planning perspective:

   1.  All internal infrastructure IP's for Service Provider network
   devices should be assigned from a dedicated IP block.

   2.  Connectivity for External users and networks to the service
   provider routers should be from a separate IP block.  This block
   should not overlap with Service Provider's internal infrastructure
   network block.

   3.  Consistent policy of IP assignment should be in place, for
   example, first usable IP should always be on Service Providers
   network and second useable IP for External users or vice versa.

   To discuss this further, let's assume Service Provider assigns a
   first useable IP from a /30 subnet to its EDGE devices.  First
   useable IP from a /30 subnet will be an ODD IP, similarly, second
   usable IP will be an EVEN number assigned to the customer external
   WAN interface.

   The ingress filtering at EDGE devices will only allow EVEN IP and
   deny ODD IP with few exceptions with the directly connected device at
   layer 3 IP protocol.  To accomplish the IP filter list in the Service
   Provider EDGE device, SP need to create a policy that consist of a
   technique which uses network wild card mask.

3.  Background

   Wildcard mask bits is one of the most important concept in IP access
   lists for ingress filtering.  Routers use them to determine which
   bits in an address will be significant.  Here is an example to filter
   the ODD IP of a 200.104.0.0/24 network


   Decimal IP address:     200.104.0.1
   Binary IP address:      11001000.01101000.00000000.00000001

   Decimal Mask:           0.0.0.254
   Binary mask:            00000000.00000000.00000000.11111110

   This wildcard mask requires that the first three octets and the final
   bit position of the forth octet match the IP address.  Since the
   final bit position in the forth octet of the IP address is set to 1,
   all packets that the access list will permit or deny must have a 1 in
   the final bit position of the forth octet.

4.  Securing Service Providers EDGE Devices

   By utilizing wildcard mask bits, ALL first useable IP address of a
   /30 subnet mask can be blocked from EXTERNAL address space with the
   exception of directly connected user.  At the same time, second
   useable IP of /30 subnet mask will be reachable of the same subnet
   mask.  In other words, all EVEN IPs will be reachable and accessible
   from external network and users.  To apply the above policy of
   ingress filtering, let's assume following IPs and requirements:

   - Separate block of IP for INTERNAL infrastructure, in this example
   we are using 200.100.0.0/16.

   - Separate block of IP for EXTERNAL connectivity, in this example we
   are using 200.104.0.0/16.

   - First usable IP of a subnet mask /30 should be on assigned on
   Service Providers EDGE device and second useable IP for External
   users.

   The first category of IP block 200.100.0.0/16 is reserved for Service
   Provider INTERNAL infrastructure devices and that is normally denied
   and inaccessible from external sources.

   The second category of IP block 200.104.0.0/16 is reserved for
   service providers EDGE devices to connect with external user.





                                                   (200.104.0.6/30)
                                                          /
                                                        CE2
                                                        /
     (200.104.0.1/30)                                  /
       /                                              /
      SP EDGE device#1<-->SP INTERNAL device<--->SP EDGE device#2
        \                                            \
         \                                           (200.104.0.5/30)

           CE1
            \
       (200.104.0.2/30)


   INTERNAL infrastructure address block (200.100.0.0/16) can be secured
   by simply denying the whole address block from external sources at

   the perimeter of the network.

   In order to secure the EDGE devices facing external networks and
   users, the following below rules must be satisfied in order to apply
   ingress filtering:

   - Allow required routing and other management protocol from directly
   connected user to the service provider EDGE devices for local route
   processor handling.

   - Deny all types of external traffic destined to first useable IP of
   subnet mask /30 to external address space (200.104.0.0/16)

   To elaborate the above statement further, the following guidelines
   below will be used to configure the ingress filtering to protect the
   EXTERNAL address space (200.104.0.0/16) at the EDGE devices:

   1.  Point-to-point IP for external connectivity will be assigned from
   a dedicated EXTERNAL address space.
   2.  First useable IP of a point-to-point (/30 subnet mask) should
   assign to Service provider's edge device and second IP to external
   device (CE1)
   3.  CE1 should be allowed to send required routing and other
   management protocol (for example BGP and ICMP) packets to directly
   connected service provider device EDGE device # 1 (local processing
   traffic for the router)
   4.After allowing restricted traffic as per above step for the route
   processor handling, all packets from external sources destined to
   first usable IP (which is ODD IP in this case) of aggregate EXTERNAL
   address spaced will be denied.
   5.Finally allowing all type of transit traffic

   Same policy will be applied with all other external sources.

   Here is the further explanation of policy number 4.  After allowing
   specific type traffic from directly connected device (as per policy
   number 3), all types of other external users and networks should not
   send data to ODD IPs of 200.104.0.0/16 block.  In order to achieve
   this result, following IP address and subnet mask will be used:



   Decimal IP address:     200.104.0.1
   Binary IP address:      11001000.01101000.00000000.00000001

   Decimal Mask:           0.0.255.254
   Binary Mask:            00000000.00000000.11111111.11111110

   The above wildcard mask requires that the first two octets and the
   final bit position of the fourth octet match the IP address.  Since
   the final bit position in the fourth octet of the IP address is set
   to 1, all packets that the access list will deny must have a 1 in the
   final bit position of the forth octet, which is terminated to the
   service provider EDGE device.

   The configuration will be as follows:

   Ingress policy on EDGE device # 1 with CE1:

   !<Policy # 1> Deny access to internal infrastructure address space
   [Deny ANY SOURCE IP to INTERNAL block 200.100.0.0/16]

   !<Policy #2> Permit ICMP from CE1 to EDGE device # 1
   [Permit ICMP from host 200.104.1.2 to SP EDGE device 200.104.1.1]

   !<Policy #3> Permit BGP between CE1 and EDGE device # 1
   [Permit BGP protocol between 200.104.1.2 AND 200.104.1.1]

   !<Policy #4> Deny access to ODD IPs assigned to SP EDGE devices
   [Deny ANY SOURCE IP to ODD IP of 200.104.0.0/16]

   !<Policy #5> Permit transit traffic.
   [Permit all types of traffic]

   Ingress policy on EDGE device # 2 with CE2:

   !<Policy # 1> Deny access to internal infrastructure address space
   [Deny ANY SOURCE IP to INTERNAL block 200.100.0.0/16]

   !<Policy #2> Permit ICMP from CE2 to EDGE device # 2
   [Permit ICMP from host 200.104.1.6 to SP EDGE device 200.104.1.5]

   !<Policy #3> Permit BGP between CE2 and EDGE device # 2
   [Permit BGP protocol between 200.104.1.6 AND 200.104.1.5]

   !<Policy #4> Deny access to ODD IPs assigned to SP EDGE devices
   [Deny ANY SOURCE IP to ODD IP of 200.104.0.0/16]

   !<Policy #5> Permit transit traffic.
   [Permit all types of traffic] According to above policy, SP's edge
   device # 1 will accept ICMP and BGP packets coming from CE1 for the
   local Route Processor handling.  There is no reachability from CE1 to
   other interface IPs assigned to Service provider EDGE devices.  CE1
   can access and reach other CE routers by using point-to-point address
   of 200.104.0.0/16 block.  For example, if CE1 sends a packet to
   Service provider edge device # 2 interface (which is 200.104.0.5)

   connected to CE2 the packet will be dropped as per ingress policy
   number 4, but on the other hand, CE1 can send all types of packet to
   CE2 (which is 200.104.0.6).

5.  Summary

   The EVEN/ODD subnet mask bit in ingress filtering is a scalable way
   to secure the Infrastructure Network Layer, however, there are few
   constraints are faced such as separate block usage is imposed for a
   given environment, which may or may not be possible for a service
   provider.  However, EVEN/ODD subnet mask bit provides a secure and
   flexible, yet a powerful gizmo in the realm of Infrastructure Network
   security and help to reduce the depletion of IPv4 address space.
   Same concept can be applied in case of using /31 subnet mask with the
   point-to-point link.

6.  Security Considerations

   The primary intent of this document is to inherently increase
   security practices and awareness for the Internet community as a
   whole; as more Internet Providers and corporate network
   administrators implement ingress filtering, the opportunity for an
   attacker to service provider's edge devices addresses as an attack
   methodology will significantly lessen.
