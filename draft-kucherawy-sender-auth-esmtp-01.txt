Internet-Draft    Authentication-Results SMTP Extension   September 2008


1.  Introduction

   Electronic mail, though ubiquitous and highly useful, is also prone
   to increasing abuse by parties that choose to exploit its lenient
   design for nefarious purposes such as "spam" and "phishing."  Abuse
   of this leniency has become so widespread as to become an economic
   problem.  Several nascent methods of mitigating this problem such as
   [DKIM] appear to make strides in this direction but are themselves
   not sufficient.  In many cases the results of attempts to
   authenticate messages must be relayed to the user for final
   disposition.

   This memo defines a new SMTP extension which is used to relay message
   authentication results from upstream (e.g. "border") mail servers to
   internal mail servers which ultimately do message delivery.  This
   information can then be used by delivery agents or even the users
   themselves when determining whether or not the content of such
   messages is trustworthy.

   The extension is defined using the methods specified in [SMTP] to
   enable a server to announce that it is willing to accept this
   information from upstream mail servers.  Clients observing this
   announcement can then elect to send that information with the message
   when the latter is relayed.

   The message header defined in
   [I-D.DRAFT-KUCHERAWY-SENDER-AUTH-HEADER] serves a similar purpose and
   is simple to implement but has some moderate security implications,
   so a more secure channel is required.  In particular, the header
   block of a message is generally unauthenticated and is also typically
   relayed intact, meaning it is an obvious vector for data forgery.
   Thus, trusting part of a message header to be secure is a difficult
   problem.  This method establishes a much better trust boundary and
   removes that obvious attack vector.

   [UPDATE PRIOR TO FINAL VERSION] At the time of publication of this
   draft, [AUTH], [DKIM], [DOMAINKEYS], [SENDERID] and [SPF] are the
   published e-mail authentication methods in common use.  As various
   methods emerge, it is necessary to prepare for their appearance and
   encourage convergence in the area of interfacing these filters to
   electroic mail servers.

1.1.  Purpose

   The SMTP extension defined in this memo is expected to serve several
   purposes:

   1.  Convey to MUAs from filters and Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) the
       results of various message authentication checks being applied;

   2.  Provide a common location for the presentation of this data;

   3.  Create an extensible framework for specifying results from new
       authentication methods as such emerge;

   4.  Convey the results of message authentication tests to later
       filtering agents within the same "trust domain", as such agents
       might apply more or less stringent checks based on message
       authentication results;

   5.  Do all of this in a way not prone to forgery or
       misinterpretation.

1.2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

   An "MTA" is a Mail Transfer Agent, or any agent which uses [SMTP] or
   its extensions to format and transport a message.

   An "MDA" is a Mail Delivery Agent (also sometimes referred to as
   "LDA" or Local Delivery Agent), or any agent which has access to
   receive a message from an MTA and write it into the receiving user's
   "inbox".

   An "MUA" is a Mail User Agent, or any software which retrieves and
   displays messages on behalf of a user.

   A "border MTA" is an MTA which acts as a gateway between the general
   Internet and the users within an organizational boundary.

   A "delivery MTA" (or Mail Delivery Agent or MDA) is an MTA which
   actually enacts delivery of a message to a user's inbox or other
   final delivery.

   An "intermediate MTA" is an MTA which handles messages after a border
   MTAs and before a delivery MTA.

   Generally it is assumed that the work of applying message
   authentication schemes takes place at a border MTA or a delivery MTA.
   This specification is written with that assumption in mind.  However,
   there are some sites at which the entire mail infrastructure consists
   of a single host.  In such cases, such terms as "border MTA" and
   "delivery MTA" may well apply to the same machine or even the very
   same agent.  It is also possible that message authentication could
   take place on an intermediate MTA.  Although this document doesn't
   specifically include such cases, they are not meant to be excluded
   from this specification.

   See [I-D.DRAFT-CROCKER-EMAIL-ARCH] for further discussion on e-mail
   system architecture.

   In the figure shown above, the double-lines indicate the portions of
   the transport of a message where this protocol would be applied.
   Note also that the Local Mail Transfer Protocol [LMTP] could benefit
   from a similar extension.

2.  Framework for the Authentication Results Extension

   The framework for the Authentication Results Extension is as follows:

   1.  The name of the SMTP service extension is "Authentication-
       Results";

   2.  The SMTP buffer length is extended by 256 bytes on servers
       offering this service extension;

   3.  The EHLO keyword value associated with the extension is AUTHRES;

   4.  No parameter is used with the AUTHRES EHLO keyword;

   5.  An additional, optional parameter called AUTHRES is added to the
       MAIL command;

   6.  No additional parameters are added to the RCPT command;

   7.  No additional SMTP verbs are defined by this extension; and

   8.  The next section specifies how support for the extension affects
       the behaviour of a server and client SMTP session.

Internet-Draft    Authentication-Results SMTP Extension   September 2008


3.  The Authentication-Results Service Extension

   When a client wishes to relay message authentication information to a
   downstream server, it first issues the EHLO command to the SMTP
   server.  If the SMTP server responds with code 250 to the EHLO
   command and the response includes the EHLO keyword AUTHRES, then the
   SMTP server has indicated that it can accept message authentication
   information from the client.

3.1.  Client Implementation

   Once the client has confirmed that support exists for this extension
   in the server to which it has connected, it may then elect to relay
   its collected message authentication results as part of an extended
   MAIL command.  The format of the extended command is defined below.

   More than one such result may be relayed in a single extended MAIL
   command.

   The authentication results relayed by this method need not have been
   established by the agent acting as SMTP client.  A client may elect
   to forward, by way of this extension, authentication results relayed
   to it about a message by previous clients.

3.2.  Server Implementation

   The SMTP server, upon receiving the EHLO command from the new client,
   may decide to advertise its support of this extension by including
   the AUTHRES keyword in its reply to the EHLO command.

   Although software support for the extension may be present, the
   server is not required to advertise such support if, for example, the
   client making the connection is not one from which the server wishes
   to trust such data.

   Upon receipt of authentication results from the upstream MTA, the
   receiving MTA may analyze the results and, if it decides the results
   are not favourable, may elect to return an SMTP result code other
   than the typical 250 success result to the extended MAIL command in
   order to reject the message.

   The authentication results ultimately received by an MDA may elect to
   store that information for ultimate consumption by the end user,
   either graphically or by way of filtering.  This can be accomplished
   using the message header field defined in
   [I-D.DRAFT-KUCHERAWY-SENDER-AUTH-HEADER] or by means of a new and as-
   yet-unspecified [IMAP] annotation via [ANNOTATE].

Internet-Draft    Authentication-Results SMTP Extension   September 2008


3.3.  MAIL Command Extension

   The MAIL command is extended by this specification to allow the
   relaying of authentication results.  As there are several message
   authentication schemes in common and growing use, the extension must
   permit multiple results to be relayed for a given message.

   The extension adds an AUTHRES parameter to the MAIL command.  The
   formal definition, using [ABNF]:

      authres = 1*( "AUTHRES" "=" version ":"
                                  authserv-id ":"
                                  methodspec ":"
                                  propspec )
              ; relays a single unit of authentication results
              ; information


   version = 1*DIGIT
           ; indicates which version of this specification is in use;
           ; this specification is version "1"; the absence of a version
           ; implies this version of the specification


     authserv-id = dot-atom-text
                 ; see below for a description of this element;
                 ; "dot-atom-text" is defined in section 3.2.4 of [MAIL]


      methodspec = method "=" result
                 ; indicates which authentication method was evaluated


      propspec = ptype "." property "=" pvalue
               ; an indication of which property of the message
               ; was evaluated by the authentication scheme being
               ; applied to yield the reported result


      method = token [ "/" version ]
             ; a method indicates which method's result is
             ; is represented by "result", and is one of the methods
             ; explicitly defined as valid in this document
             ; or is an extension method as defined below


      result = token
             ; an indication of the results of the attempt to

             ; authenticate the message; see below for details


      ptype = "smtp" / "header" / "body" / "policy"
            ; indicates whether the property being evaluated was
            ; a parameter to an [SMTP] command, or was a value taken
            ; from a message header field, or was some property of
            ; the message body, or some other property evaluated by
            ; the receiving MTA


      property = token
              ; if "ptype" is "smtp", this indicates which [SMTP]
              ; command provided the value which was evaluated by the
              ; authentication scheme being applied; if "ptype" is
              ; "header", this indicates from which header field the
              ; value being evaluated was extracted; if "ptype" is
              ; "body", this indicates the offset into the body at which
              ; content of interest was detected; if "ptype" is "policy"
              ; then this indicates the name of the policy which caused
              ; this header field to be added (see below)


      pvalue = token / addr-spec
            ; the value extracted from the message property defined
            ; by the "ptype.property" construction; if the value
            ; identifies a mailbox, then it is an "addr-spec"
            ; as defined in section 3.4 of [MAIL];

   The "token" and "value" are as defined in section 5.1 of [MIME].

   The "token" used in a "result" above is further constrained by the
   necessity of being enumerated in Section 3.5 or an amendment to it.

   See Section 3.4 for a description of the "authserv-id" element.

   The list of commands eligible for use with the "smtp" ptype can be
   found in [SMTP] and subsequent amendments.

   The "propspec" may be omitted if for example the method was unable to
   extract any properties to do its evaluation yet has a result to
   report.

   The "ptype" and "property" values used by each authentication method
   should be defined in the specification for that method (or its
   amendments).

   The "ptype" and "property" are case-insensitive.

Internet-Draft    Authentication-Results SMTP Extension   September 2008


   A "ptype" value of "policy" indicates a policy decision about the
   message not specific to a property of the message that could be
   extracted.  For example, if a method would normally report a
   "ptype.property" of "header.From" and no From: header field was
   present, the method can use "policy" to indicate that no conclusion
   about the authenticity of the message could be reached.

   If the parsed "ptype.property" construction clearly identifies a
   mailbox (in particular, smtp.mailfrom, smtp.rcpt, header.from,
   header.sender), then the "pvalue" MUST be an "addr-spec".  Other
   properties (e.g. smtp.helo) may be evaluated, but the property MUST
   still be expressed as a "token" for simplified parsing.

3.4.  Authentication Identifier Fields

   Every Authentication-Results header field has an authentication
   identifier field ("authserv-id" above).  This is similar in syntax to
   a fully-qualified domain name.

   The authentication identifier field provides a unique identifier that
   refers to the authenticating service within a given mail
   administrative domain.  The uniqueness of the identifier is
   guaranteed by the mail administrative domain that generates it and
   must pertain to exactly that one mail administrative domain.  This
   identifier is intended to be machine-readable and not necessarily
   meaningful to users.  MUAs may use this identifier to determine
   whether or not the data contained in an Authentication-Results header
   field can be trusted.

   For tracing and debugging purposes, the authentication identifier
   SHOULD be the domain name of the MTA performing the authentication
   check whose result is being reported.

   Examples of valid authentication identifiers are mail.example.org,
   engineering.example.net and ms1.newyork.example.com.

3.5.  Result Values

   Each individual authentication method returns one of a set of
   specific result values.  The subsections below define these results
   for the authentication methods specifically supported by this memo.
   New methods not specified in this document intended to be supported
   by the header field defined in this memo MUST include a similar
   result table either in its defining memo or in a supplementary one.

Internet-Draft    Authentication-Results SMTP Extension   September 2008


3.5.1.  DKIM and DomainKeys Results

   The result values used by [DKIM] and [DOMAINKEYS] are as follows:

   none:  The message was not signed.

   pass:  The message was signed, the signature(s) is (were) acceptable
      to the verifier, and the signature(s) passed verification tests.

   fail:  The message was signed and the signature(s) is (were)
      acceptable to the verifier, but it (they) failed the verification
      test(s).

   policy:  The message was signed but the signature(s) is (were) not
      acceptable to the verifier.

   neutral:  The message was signed but the signature(s) contained
      syntax errors or were not otherwise able to be processed.  This
      result SHOULD also be used for other failures not covered
      elsewhere in this list.

   temperror:  The message could not be verified due to some error which
      is likely transient in nature, such as a temporary inability to
      retrieve a public key.  A later attempt may produce a final
      result.

   permerror:  The message could not be verified due to some error which
      is unrecoverable, such as a required header field being absent.  A
      later attempt is unlikley to produce a final result.

   A signature is "acceptable to the verifier" if it passes local policy
   checks (or there are no specific local policy checks).  For example,
   a verifier might require that the signature(s) on the message be
   added by the domain identified in the From: header field of the
   message, thus making third-party signatures unacceptable.

3.5.2.  DKIM ADSP Results

   The result values are used by [I-D.DRAFT-IETF-DKIM-SSP] as follows:

   none:  No DKIM author domain signing practises (ADSP) record was
      published.

   pass:  A DKIM ADSP record was published which indicated the mail
      should be signed with an author signature, and this message had
      such a signature that validated.

Internet-Draft    Authentication-Results SMTP Extension   September 2008


   unknown:  No valid author signature was found on the message and
      either the published ADSP was "unknown", or no policy was
      published.

   signed:  A valid author signature was found on the message and the
      published ADSP was "unknown".

   fail:  No valid author signature was found on the message and the
      published ASDP record indicated an "all" policy.

   discard:  No valid author signature was found on the message and the
      published ADSP record indicated a "discardable" policy.

   nxdomain:  Evaluating the ADSP for the author's domain indicated that
      the author's domain does not exist.

   temperror:  A DKIM policy could not be retrieved due to some error
      which is likely transient in nature, such as a temporary DNS
      error.  A later attempt may produce a final result.

   permerror:  A DKIM policy could not be retrieved due to some error
      which is likely not transient in nature, such as a permanent DNS
      error.  A later attempt is unlikely to produce a final result.

3.5.3.  SPF and Sender-ID Results

   The result values are used by [SPF] and [SENDERID] as follows:

   none:  No policy records were published by the sender's domain.

   neutral:  The sender's domain has asserted that it cannot or does not
      want to assert whether or not the sending IP address is authorized
      to send mail on behalf of the sender's domain.

   pass:  The client is authorized to inject or relay mail on behalf of
      the sender's domain.

   policy:  The client is authorized to inject or relay mail on behalf
      of the sender's domain according to the authentication method's
      algorithm, but local policy dictates that the result is
      unacceptable.

   hardfail:  This client is explicitly not authorized to inject or
      relay mail on behalf of the sender's domain.

Internet-Draft    Authentication-Results SMTP Extension   September 2008


   softfail:  The sender's domain believes the client was not authorized
      to inject or relay mail on its behalf but is unwilling to make a
      strong assertion to that effect.

   temperror:  The message could not be verified due to some error which
      is likely transient in nature, such as a temporary inability to
      retrieve a policy record from DNS.  A later attempt may produce a
      final result.

   permerror:  The message could not be verified due to some error which
      is unrecoverable, such as a required header field being absent.  A
      later attempt is unlikley to produce a final result.

   The distinction between and interpretation of "none" and "neutral"
   under these methods is discussed further in [SPF].

   The "policy" result would be returned if, for example, [SPF] returned
   as "pass" result, but a local policy check matches the sending domain
   to one found in an explicit list of unacceptable domains (e.g.
   spammers).

3.5.4.  iprev Results

   The result values are used by the "iprev" method, defined in
   Section 4, are as follows:

   pass:  The reverse DNS evaluation succeeded, i.e. the "reverse" and
      "forward" lookup results were in agreement.

   hardfail:  The reverse DNS evaluation failed.  In particular, the
      "reverse" and "forward" lookups each produced results but they
      were not in agreement.

   softfail:  The reverse DNS evaluation failed.  In particular, one or
      both of the "reverse" and forward lookups returned no data (i.e. a
      DNS reply code of NODATA).

   temperror:  The reverse DNS evaluation could not be completed due to
      some error which is likely transient in nature, such as a
      temporary DNS error.  A later attempt may produce a final result.

   permerror:  The reverse DNS evaluation could not be completed due to
      some error which is unrecoverable (e.g. a DNS reply code of NODATA
      or NXDOMAIN).  A later attempt is unlikely to produce a final
      result.

   There is no "none" for this method since any TCP connection
   delivering e-mail has an IP address associated with it, so some kind

   of evaluation will always be possible.

3.5.5.  SMTP AUTH Results

   The result values are used by the [AUTH] method are as follows:

   none:  SMTP authentication was not attempted.

   pass:  The SMTP client had authenicated to the server reporting the
      result using the protocol described in [AUTH].

   fail:  The SMTP client had attempted to authenticate to the server
      using the protocol described in [AUTH] but was not successful, yet
      continued to send the message about which a result is being
      reported.

   temperror:  The SMTP client attempted to authenticate using the
      protocol described in [AUTH] but was not able to complete the
      attempt due to some error which is likely transient in nature,
      such as a temporary LDAP lookup error.  A later attempt may
      produce a final result.

   permerror:  The SMTP client attempted to authenticate using the
      protocol described in [AUTH] but was not able to complete the
      attempt due to some error which is likely not transient in nature,
      such as a permanent LDAP lookup error.  A later attempt is not
      likely produce a final result.

   Note that an agent making use of the data provided by this header
   field SHOULD consider "fail" and "temperror" to be the synonymous in
   terms of message authentication, i.e. the client did not
   authenticate.

3.5.6.  Extension Result Codes

   Additional result codes (extension results) may be defined in the
   future by later revisions or extensions to this specification.
   Extension results beginning with "x-" will never be defined as
   standard fields; such names are reserved for experimental use.
   Result codes not beginning with "x-" MUST be registered with the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and published in an RFC.
   See Section 6 for further details.

   Implementations reporting new result codes MUST use the "x-" prefix
   until such time as the new method is registered by IANA.

   Extension results MUST only be used within trust domains that have
   explicitly consented to use them.  These results and the parameters

   associated with them are not documented in RFCs.  Therefore, they are
   subject to change at any time and not suitable for production use.
   Any MTA or MUA intended for production use SHOULD ignore or delete
   any Authentication-Results header field that includes an extension
   result.

3.6.  Authentication Methods

   This section defines the supported authentication methods and
   discusses the proper means for applying experimental and other
   extension methods.

3.6.1.  Definition Of Initial Methods

   As they are currently existing specifications for message
   authentication, it is appropriate to define an authentication method
   identifier for each of [AUTH], [DKIM], [DOMAINKEYS], [SENDERID] and
   [SPF].  Therefore, the authentication method identifiers "auth",
   "dkim", "domainkeys", "senderid" and "spf" respectively are hereby
   defined for MTAs applying those specifications for e-mail message
   authentication.

   Furthermore, method "iprev" is defined in Section 4.

   Finally, as its publication is imminent, this document also defines
   "dkim-adsp" per [I-D.DRAFT-IETF-DKIM-SSP].

   See Section 6 for details.

3.6.2.  Extension Methods

   Additional authentication method identifiers (extension methods) may
   be defined in the future by later revisions or extensions to this
   specification.  Extension methods beginning with "x-" will never be
   defined as standard fields; such names are reserved for experimental
   use.  Method identifiers not beginning with "x-" MUST be registered
   with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and published in
   an RFC.  See Section 6 for further details.

   Extension methods may be defined for the following reasons:

   1.  To allow additional information from new authentication systems
       to be communicated to MUAs.  The names of such identifiers should
       reflect the name of the method being defined, but should not be
       needlessly long.

   2.  To allow the creation of "sub-identifiers" which indicate
       different levels of authentication and differentiate between



Kucherawy                 Expires April 2, 2009                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft    Authentication-Results SMTP Extension   September 2008


       their relative strengths, e.g. "auth1-weak" and "auth1-strong".

   Implementations of new methods MUST use the "x-" prefix until such
   time as the new method is registered by IANA.

   Experimental method identifiers MUST only be used within trust
   domains that have explicitly consented to use them.  These method
   identifiers and the parameters associated with them are not
   documented in RFCs.  Therefore, they are subject to change at any
   time and not suitable for production use.  Any MTA or MUA intended
   for production use SHOULD ignore or delete any Authentication-Results
   header field that includes an experimental method identifier.

3.7.  Local Policy Enforcement

   If a site's local policy is to consider a non-recoverable failure
   result (e.g. "fail" for DKIM, "hardfail" for SPF or "discard" for
   DKIM-ADSP) for any particular authentication method as justification
   to reject the message completely, the border MTA SHOULD issue an
   [SMTP] rejection response to the message rather than adding this
   header with the failure result and allowing it to proceed toward
   delivery.  This is more desirable than allowing the message to reach
   an internal host's MTA or spam filter, thus possibly generating a
   local rejection such as a [DSN] to a forged originator.

   The same MAY also be done for local policy decisions overriding the
   results of the authentication methods (e.g. the "policy" result codes
   described in Section 3.5.

   Such rejections at the SMTP protocol level are not possible if local
   policy is enforced at the MUA and not the MTA.  Unfortunately, this
   may be a common scenario.

4.  The 'iprev' Authentication Method

   This section defines an additional authentication method called
   "iprev".

   In general, "iprev" is an attempt to verify that a client appears to
   be valid based on some DNS queries.  Upon receiving a session
   initiation of some kind from a client, the IP address of the client
   peer is queried for matching names (i.e. a number-to-name
   translation, also known as a "reverse lookup" or a "PTR" record
   query).  Once that result is acquired, a lookup of each of the names
   (i.e. a name-to-number translation, or an "A" record query) thus
   retrieved is done.  The response to this second check should result
   in at least one mapping back to the client's IP address.

   More algorithmically: If the client peer's IP address is A, the list
   of names to which A maps (after a "PTR" query) is the set N, and the
   union of IP addresses to which each member of N maps (after an "A"
   query) is L, then this test is successful if A is an element of L.

   Section 5.5 of [SPF] contains more detail about this process as well
   as some discussion of possible denial-of-service attacks.  [DNS-IP6]
   discusses the format of this query for the IPv6 case.

   A successful test using this algorithm constitutes a result of "pass"
   since the domain in which the client's PTR claims it belongs has
   confirmed that claim.  A failure to match constitutes a "hardfail".
   There is no case in which "softfail" or "neutral" can be returned.
   The remaining "temperror" and "permerror" cases refer respectively to
   temporary and permanent DNS query errors.

   There is some contention regarding the wisdom and reliability of this
   test.  For example, in some regions it can be difficult for this test
   ever to pass because the practise of arranging to match the forward
   and reverse DNS is infrequently observed.  Therefore, the actual
   implementation details of how a verifier performs an "iprev" test are
   not specified here.  The verifier MAY report a successful or failed
   "iprev" test at its discretion having done some kind of check of the
   validity of the connection's identity using DNS.  It is incumbent
   upon an agent making use of the reported "iprev" result to understand
   what exactly that particular verifier is attempting to report.

   [NOTE TO RFC EDITOR] This is a duplicate of a section in
   [I-D.DRAFT-KUCHERAWY-SENDER-AUTH-HEADER] and can be removed and
   simply referenced if that draft reaches publication first.

5.  Conformance and Usage Requirements

   An agent acting as an SMTP server conforms to this specification if
   it offers the AUTHRES extension to upstream MTAs from which it would
   trust such data.  Servers that advertise AUTHRES in their EHLOs MUST
   expect the additional envelope information described in this draft.

   A client wishing to use this extension MUST first see AUTHRES as part
   of the EHLO response from a server.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register this new SMTP extension and to create a
   new table as described below.

6.1.  Email Authentication Method Name Registry

   Names of message authentication methods supported by this
   specification must be registered with IANA, with the exception of
   experimental names as described in Section 3.6.2.

   New entries are assigned only for values that have been documented in
   a published RFC that has IETF Review, per [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS].
   Each method must register a name, the specification that defines it,
   one or more "ptype" values appropriate for use with that method, and
   which "property" value(s) should be reported by that method.

   The initial set of entries in this registry is as follows:

Internet-Draft    Authentication-Results SMTP Extension   September 2008


7.  Security Considerations

   The following security considerations apply when applying or
   processing the Authentication-Results SMTP service extension:

7.1.  Trusting SMTP Clients

   As described in Section 3.2, an MTA server implementing this
   extension need not offer the AUTHRES service to an SMTP client if
   it's sure it won't care what that client has to say about the
   authenticity of the message.  This establishes a "trust boundary"
   within which SMTP clients are offered the extension; clients outside
   that boundary are not offered the extension.

   A client that tries to use the extension when it was not offered may
   be deemed a security risk.

   Although an obvious location of this boundary would be a published MX
   for the recipient's domain, this is not always the case.  Thus,
   implementors are advised to default to a "trust no-one" posture and
   have the trust boundary established explicitly by the user.

7.2.  Misleading Results

   Until some form of service for querying the reputation of a sending
   agent is widely deployed, the existence of this header field
   indicating a "pass" does not render the message trustworthy.  It is
   possible for an arriving piece of spam or other undesirable mail to
   pass checks by several of the methods enumerated above (e.g. a piece
   of spam signed using [DKIM] by the originator of the spam, which
   might be a spammer or a compromised system).

7.3.  Reverse IP Query Denial-Of-Service Attacks

   Section 5.5 of [SPF] describes a DNS-based denial-of-service attack
   for verifiers that attempt to DNS-based identity verification of
   arriving client connections.  A verifier wishing to do this check and
   report this information SHOULD take care not to go to unbounded
   lengths to resolve "A" and "PTR" queries.  MUAs or other filters
   making use of an "iprev" result specified by this memo SHOULD be
   aware of the algorithm used by the verifier reporting the result and
   thus be aware of its limitations.

7.4.  Mitigation of Backscatter

   Failing to follow the instructions of Section 3.7 can result in a
   denial-of-service attack caused by the generation of [DSN] messages
   (or equivalent) to addresses which did not send the messages being

   rejected.

7.5.  Internal MTA Lists

   Section 3.2 mentions that the participating server need not offer
   this extension to untrusted clients.  A compliant installation will
   have to include at each MTA a list of other MTAs known to be
   compliant and trustworthy.  Failing to keep this list current as
   internal infrastructure changes may expose a domain to attack.

7.6.  Attacks Against Authentication Methods

   If an attack becomes known against an authentication method, clearly
   then the agent verifying that method can be fooled into thinking an
   inauthentic message is authentic, and thus the value of this header
   field can be misleading.  It follows that any attack against the
   authentication methods supported by this document (and later
   amendments to it) is also a security consideration here.

7.7.  Intentionally Malformed Extension Parameters

   It is possible for an attacker to add AUTHRES parameter which is
   extraordinarily large or otherwise malformed in an attempt to
   discover or exploit weaknesses in parsing code.  Implementors must
   thoroughly verify all such header fields received from MTAs and be
   robust against intentionally as well as unintentionally malformed
   data.

7.8.  Compromised Internal Hosts

   An internal MUA or MTA which has been compromised could generate mail
   with forged data, eventually generating an AUTHRES parameter which
   endorses it.  Although it is clearly a larger concern to have
   compromised internal machines than it is to prove the value of this
   extension, this risk can be mitigated by arranging that internal MTAs
   not relay this data field if it claims to have been added by a
   trusted border MTA (as described above) yet the [SMTP] connection is
   not coming from an internal machine known to be running an authorized
   MTA.  However, in such a configuration, legitimate MTAs will have to
   add this data when legitimate internal-only messages are generated.

Appendix B.  Examples

   This section presents some examples of the use of this protocol
   extension to relay message authentication results.  In these
   examples, "C" indicates data sent by the SMTP client and "S"
   indicates data sent by the SMTP server, and other annotations are
   enclosed in square brackets.

B.1.  Single authentication result

   Relaying a single authentication result:

      [connection established]
   S: 220 inbox.example.com SMTP server ready
   C: EHLO border.example.com
   S: 250-inbox.example.com Hello root@foobar.example.net
   S: 250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES
   S: 250-SIZE
   S: 250-DSN
   S: 250-AUTHRES
   S: 250 HELP
   C: MAIL FROM:<me@example.net> AUTHRES=dkim=pass:header.i=@example.net
   S: 250 Sender OK
   C: RCPT TO:<postmaster@example.com>
   S: 250 Recipient OK
   C: DATA
   S: 354 Enter mail, end with "." on a line by itself
   C: [message body]
   C: .
   S: 250 l9NE6WYF026506 Message received
   C: QUIT
   S: 221 Bye!
      [connection closed]

   Example 1: Relaying a single authentication result

   In this example we see a border SMTP server relaying a message to an
   internal SMTP server which will do local delivery for example.com's
   users.  The SMTP extension is advertised by the server (it trusts
   this source as one likely to relay valid authentication data) and
   used by the client.  In this instance, the server validated the
   message's authenticity using [DKIM] and determined that the
   verification test passed.  Also relayed is information about what
   agent was responsible for affixing the signature.
