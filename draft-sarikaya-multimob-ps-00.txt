1.  Introduction

   More and more operators are beginning to provide the wireless
   broadband network services such as Mobile IPTV.  Mobile IPTV service
   is a kind of audio/video (A/V) service which is combined with
   interactive data for the related or supplementary information of A/V
   program using bi-directional wireless broadband links.  Users can
   enjoy the downlink A/V stream and request more detailed or value-
   added information via uplink simultaneously.  Mobile IPTV service,
   which can also be described as place-shifting IPTV service, is to
   ensure continuous and original IPTV experiences for the users who
   move to the other place from where he or she was originally
   subscribed for [ITUIPTV].

   Apart from Mobile IPTV which is considered "the killer application",
   content broadcasting and streaming over audio and video conferencing,
   online multiplayer gaming are applications of IP multicast technology
   for mobile users.  In this document we will establish the
   requirements on supporting multicast mobility by way of improvements
   on various protocols on which the mobile users depend in order to
   receive Mobile IPTV and other multicast services

             Figure 1: Transport Profile of Multicast Mobility

   Mobile nodes (MN) attach to a base station (BS) through wireless
   interfaces.  The Access Router (AR) is the first IP hop router of
   MNs.  MN as the multicast receiver uses the access network to receive
   the content coming from the content network where the multicast
   source is located.  The edge network aggregates between the access
   and the core which is the backbone infrastructure.  Multicast enabled
   core, edge and access network is assumed in this document.

   MN uses Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) [RFC3376] or
   Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) [RFC3810] to dynamically join/
   leave multicast groups.  IGMP/MLD runs between MN and the AR.  This
   is called local subscription.  If mobility protocol such as Mobile IP
   [RFC3775] is used, IGMP/MLD runs between MN and the home agent (HA)
   at the home network.  This is called remote subscription.  While the
   current Mboned work on light-weight IGMP/MLD
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-lightweight-igmpv3-mldv2] aims to simplify the
   original IGMPv3/MLDv2 thereby simplifying switch and host-side
   implementation, there is work needed to support mobility in IGMP/MLD.

   Currently the unicast global mobility protocol MIPv6 [RFC3775] allows
   remote subscription and HA tunnels multicast traffic to MN's current

   access network.  This creates a bidirectional tunnel which is
   inefficient.


4.  Problems due to multicast for mobile nodes

   The currently available multicast protocols were designed based on
   the receivers being fixed nodes with large processing capacities.
   Because of this, they usually have large leave latencies and are not
   bandwidth efficient.  They also potentially involve extensive
   computation capabilities on the nodes.

4.1.  Bandwidth wastage

   Currently defined multicast protocols like IGMP and MLD send frequent
   messages over the link on which the mobile node is connected.  This
   implies a wasteful use of spectrum resources on a potentially
   expensive wireless link.  This problem can be mitigated by correctly
   adjusting the timing parameters on these multicast protocols.

4.2.  Lack of multicast support in mobility protocols

   Currently defined mobility protocols like MIPv6 [RFC3775] do not
   really support native multicast.  When a mobile node joins a
   multicast group, it uses its home address to do so.  Hence, the
   multicast packets are sent to the home agent in the mobile node's
   home network.  The home agent then encapsulates these packets inside
   an unicast tunnel terminating at the mobile node.  Thus, multiple
   mobile nodes attached to the same foreign link cannot share the same
   multicast stream, since they receive only an unicast packet.  This
   leads to useless duplication of multicast packets, while it could be
   avoided.  This can be mitigated by adding multicast extensions to the
   binding caches of mobility protocols.

4.3.  Scalability issues due to point-to-point links

   Currently defined multicast protocols do not scale very well if the
   last hop multicast router is connected to a large number of mobiles
   using point-to-point links.  This is because the router has to keep
   track of each mobile on a separate interface.  Thus the number of
   queries the router has to send out increases greatly with a large
   number of mobile nodes.  This problem can be mitigated by minor
   modifications to the multicast protocols to simplify their behavior
   on point-to-point links. e.g. remove host suppression, remove random
   delays before responses etc.

4.4.  Increased leave latency

   When a mobile host leaves a multicast group on an access link, the
   multicast router has to perform a query to determine whether any more
   hosts remain on the same multicast group on the same link.  This
   increases the leave latency to an unacceptable level.  There are
   several ways to mitigate the problem like tuning of the multicast
   protocol timers and explicit host tracking.
