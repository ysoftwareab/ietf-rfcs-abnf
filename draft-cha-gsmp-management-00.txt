Abstract

   General switch management protocol (GSMP) is an open interface
   protocol between a label switch and a controller, and it provides
   connection, configuration, event, performance management and
   synchronization. In the GSMP interface, network management functions
   can be located either in the controller or in the label switch. We
   discussed the implementation complexity of a label switch and the
   efficiency of resource usage according to the location of network
   management functions.

1. Introduction

   General switch management protocol (GSMP) provides an open interface
   that can be used to separate the data forwarder from the routing and
   other control plane protocols. GSMP protocol is asymmetric, the
   controller being the master and the switch being the slave. GSMP
   allows a controller to establish and release connections across the
   label switch; manage switch ports; request configuration information;
   request and delete reservation of switch resources; and request
   statistics. It also allows the label switch to inform the controller
   of asynchronous events such as a link going down. GSMP contains an
   adjacency protocol, which is used to synchronize states across the
   link [1].

   In the beginning, GSMP was intended only for use with ATM switches.
   GSMP has been extended to support multiple label types those are ATM,
   frame relay, multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) generic labels. In
   the MPLS system, it is possible to run the routing protocols and
   label distribution protocols on a controller while passing data
   across a label switch. GSMP provides the switch resource management
   mechanism needed in such a scenario [2]. GSMP is well suited for
   network architectures that employ label swapping in the forwarding
   plane. This property makes GSMP a good fit for generalized labels as
   defined by generalized MPLS. GSMP extensions have been progressing to
   support optical switching [3].

   There are two kinds of connections: a dynamic connection and a
   provisioned connection. A dynamic connection is controlled by the
   signaling protocol in the controller, and a provisioned connection is
   managed by the network management system. For provisioning a
   connection in the GSMP interface, network management functions can be
   located either in the controller or in the label switch.



2. Location of Network Management

   In this section, we discussed the complexity of a label switch and
   the efficiency of resource usage according to the location of network
   management functions.

2.1 Network Management Functions in the Switch

   In the GSMP interface, the controller decides the establishment of a
   connection by a connection admission control, and the switch merely
   responses the commands from the controller. If the switch has agent
   functions for network management, and it manages the provisioned
   connection in cooperation with the manager, the controller will not

   aware of the status about all switch resources. For a connection
   admission control, it is required to keep the switch resource status
   in the controller. This can be accomplished if the switch informs the
   controller of its resource status, whenever a provisioned connection
   is established or deleted by the manager.

   The potential problem is that the controller can reassign switch
   resources allocated to the provisioned connection to a dynamic
   connection. This reallocation problem will be originated from the
   delayed notification of the resource status changed by the
   provisioned connection.

   The one scheme for overcoming this reallocation problem is that the
   switch resources are divided into two groups: one group is for
   dynamic connections and the other group is for provisioned
   connections. The separation of switch resources will resolve the
   reallocation problem, but it will cause the usage of resources to be
   inefficient. That is, a connection can be established because of
   its resource shortage, even though the other part of resources has
   plenty in reserve.


2.2 Network Management Functions in the Controller

   If the simple network management (SNMP) agent is located in the
   switch, the switch should implement the SNMP interface as well as the
   GSMP interface. The implementation of these interfaces will cause the
   complexity of the switch to be increased. If we consider the SNMP
   agent is located in the controller shown in Fig. 1, the label switch
   can be easily implemented with the GSMP slave and basic system
   management functions. In this model, the manager commands the
   controller to manage a provisioned connection, then the controller
   issues GSMP messages to the label switch.

             Figure 1:  Management Model in the GSMP Interface


   When the controller manages multiple switches, SNMP agent is not
   implemented in the all switches, but in the controller. This
   mitigation of switch implementation burden coincides with the open
   interface concept [4]. In addition, the controller can manage all
   switch resources for the dynamic and provisioned connections, and
   inefficient usage of switch resources by dividing them two groups can
   be eliminated.

   If the SNMP agent is located in the controller as shown in Fig. 1, it
   is required that network management functions be mapped with GSMP
   functions.

3. Mapping Scenarios for MPLS Network Management

   In this section, we will briefly introduce the MPLS network
   management, and present example mapping scenarios between MPLS
   network management functions and GSMP functions. These mapping
   scenarios will be applicable to the generalized MPLS network
   management.


3.1 MPLS Network Management

   Integration of IP routing and layer 2 switching in MPLS, enables fast
   forwarding, traffic engineering and virtual private network services.
   A router capable of MPLS is a label switching router (LSR) and a set
   of LSRs traversed by a packet is called a label-switched path (LSP)
   [5]. Figure 2 shows management information bases (MIBs) for MPLS
   network management, which are MPLS-FTN (FEC To Next hop forwarding
   label entry), MPLS-LSR and MPLS-TE (Traffic Engineering) MIBs [6-8].

                                    +--------------+
                                  +-| MPLS-TE MIB  |
         +--------------+         | | MPLS-LSR MIB |
         | MPLS-FTN MIB |         | +--------------+
         +--------------+         |
              |   +---------------+----------------------+
              |   |               |                      |
           +--|---|---------------|----------------------|--+
           |  v   v               v                      v  |
         +----------+         +----------+          +----------+
     --> | Ingress  |---------| Core LSR |----------|  Egress  | -->
         |   LSR    |---------|          |----------|    LSR   |
         +----------+         +----------+          +----------+
           |                                                |
           +------------------------------------------------+
                Figure 2: MIBs for MPLS Network Management

   On the ingress of MPLS network, packets entering the MPLS domain are
   assigned to a forwarding equivalence class (FEC). Those packets
   belonging to a FEC are associated with a next hop label forwarding
   entry. MPLS FTN MIB defines how the LSR will impose MPLS labels onto
   incoming flows [6].

   The MPLS-TE MIB is designed to support point-to-point unidirectional
   tunnels with appropriate configuration parameters. If a tunnel
   configured, then a LSP will be created using the MPLS-LSR MIB [8].

   A LSP is modeled as a connection consisting of one or more incoming
   segments (in-segments) and/or one or more outgoing segments (out-

   segments) at a LSR. The association or interconnection of the in-
   segments and out-segments is accomplished by using a cross-connect
   tables. The MPLS-LSR MIB supports four main tables: interface
   configuration, in-segment, out-segment, and cross-connect. MPLS
   cross-connect table associates in-segments to out-segments to show
   the manager how the LSR is currently swapping these labels [7].


3.2 Mapping Scenarios

3.2.1 Connection Management

   GSMP connection messages are used by the controller to establish,
   delete and modify connections across the switch. Figure 3 shows the
   mapping procedures for a provisioned LSP, which is established and
   deleted by the manager.

   To establish a provisioned connection, the manager first sets
   segments and their traffic parameters using the MPLS-LSR MIB. If the
   segments are successfully created, the manager requests the
   controller to create a cross-connect entry. The controller commands
   the label switch to set the provisioned connection using the GSMP Add
   Branch message. If the switch responds with the positive
   acknowledgement of Add Branch message, the controller completes
   establishment of the provisioned connection by returning the SNMP Get
   Response message to the manager.

   The manager deletes the provisioned connection by setting the row
   status of the cross-connect entry as destroy. Then, the controller
   requests the switch to delete the provisioned connection using the
   GSMP Delete Branches message.


3.2.2 Configuration Management

   GSMP configuration messages permit the controller to discover the
   capabilities of the switch. Three configuration request messages have
   been defined: Switch, Port, and Service messages [1]. In the MPLS
   network management, there are no managed objects or tables, which are
   mapped with the GSMP configuration messages. To support the mapping
   procedures between GSMP configuration management and network
   management, it is required to define the configuration tables in the
   MIB. Table 1 shows configuration tables, which are mapped with the
   GSMP configuration messages.

             +-----------------------+----------------------+
             |     GSMP Message      | Configuration Table  |
             +-----------------------+----------------------+
             | Switch Configuration  | GsmpSwitchConfTable  |
             +-----------------------+----------------------+
             | Port Configuration    | GsmpPortConfTable    |
             +-----------------------+----------------------+
             | Service Configuration | GsmpServiceConfTable |
             +-----------------------+----------------------+

           Figure 4: Configuration Tables for Network Management


   Figure 5 shows the GsmpSwitchConfTable mapped with the Switch
   Configuration message. The GSMP Switch Configuration message requests
   the global (non port-specific) configuration for the switch. The
   columnar objects of this table entry are based on the information
   elements of the Switch Configuration message. This table is indexed
   by the switch partition identifier whose value matches that of the
   Switch Configuration message.

3.2.3 Performance Management

   The MPLS in-segment and out-segment performance tables contain the
   objects necessary to measure the performance of segments. The MPLS
   interface performance table has objects to measure MPLS performance
   on a per-interface basis [7]. The statistics messages of GSMP permit
   the controller to request the values of various hardware counters
   associated with the connections, input and output ports [1]. The
   counter information elements of the Connection Statistics message are
   mapped with the columnar objects of segment performance table entry.
   It is possible to map each entry of the MPLS interface performance
   table with GSMP Port Statistics message.

   The MPLS-LSR MIB includes two Notifications those are cross-connect-
   up and cross-connect-down. These Notifications are generated when the
   operational status of cross-connect are about to enter the up or down
   state from some other [7]. GSMP allows the switch to inform the
   controller of asynchronous events. The events defined in GSMP are
   Port Up, Port Down, Invalid Label, New Port, Dead Port and Adjacency
   Update [1]. If GSMP event is received from the switch, the controller
   will inform the manager of received event using the GSMP
   Notifications [9]. Figure 6 shows GSMP Notifications, which are
   mapped with GSMP event messages.
