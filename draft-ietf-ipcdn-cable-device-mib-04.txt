Abstract

This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information
Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
community.  In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for
SNMP-based management of MCNS compliant Cable Modems and Cable Modem
Termination Systems.

This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the
SNMPv2 SMI.  The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP framework
and existing SNMP standards.

This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.

This memo is a product of the IPCDN working group within the Internet
Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and should be addressed
to the working group's mailing list at ipcdn@terayon.com and/or the
author.

1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework presently consists of three
major components.  They are:

o    the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1] - the mechanisms used for
     describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

o    the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] - the core set of managed objects
     for the Internet suite of protocols.

o    the protocol, RFC 1157 [3] and/or RFC 1905 [4], - the protocol for
     accessing managed objects.

The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
experimentation and evaluation.


2.  Object Definitions

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the
SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
an administratively assigned name.  The object type together with an
object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of
the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,
termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.

INTERNET-DRAFT           MCNS Cable Device MIB                  May 1998


3.  Overview

This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of MCNS
compliant Cable Modems (CM) and Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS).
The specification is derived from the MCNS Radio Frequency Interface
specification [6].


3.1.  Structure of the MIB

This MIB is structured in six groups:

o    The docsDevBase group extends the MIB-II 'system' group with
     objects needed for cable device system management.

o    The docsDevNmAccessGroup provides a minimum level of SNMP access
     security (see Section 3 of [8]).

o    The docsDevSoftware group provides information for network-
     downloadable software upgrades.

o    The docsDevServer group provides information about the progress of
     the interaction with various provisioning servers.

o    The docsDevEvent group provides control and logging for event
     reporting

o    The docsDevFilter group configures filters at link layer and IP
     layer for bridged data traffic.


3.2.  Management requirements

3.2.1.  Handling of Software upgrades

The Cable Modem software upgrade process is documented in [6].  From a
network management station, the operator:

o    sets docsDevSwServer to the address of the TFTP server for software
     upgrades

o    sets docsDevSwFilename to the file pathname of the software upgrade
     image

o    sets docsDevSwAdminStatus to upgrade-from-mgt

One reason for the SNMP-initiated upgrade is to allow loading of a
temporary software image (e.g., special diagnostic software) that
differs from the software normally used on that device without changing
the provisioning database.



Expires November 1998                                           [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT           MCNS Cable Device MIB                  May 1998


Note that software upgrades should not be accepted blindly by the cable
device. The cable device may refuse an upgrade if:

o    The download is incomplete.

o    The file contents are incomplete or damaged.

o    The software is not intended for that hardware device (may include
     the case of a feature set that has not been purchased for this
     device).


3.2.2.  Events and Traps

This MIB provides control facilities for reporting events through
syslog, traps, and nonvolatile logging.  If events are reported through
traps, the specified conventions must be followed.  Other means of event
reporting are outside the scope of this document.

The definition and coding of events is vendor-specific.  In deference to
the network operator who must troubleshoot multi-vendor networks, the
circumstances and meaning of each event should be reported as human-
readable text.  Vendors SHOULD provide time-of-day clocks in CMs to
provide useful timestamping of events.

For each vendor-specific event that is reportable via TRAP, the vendor
must create an enterprise-specific trap definition.  Trap definitions
MUST include the event reason encoded as DisplayString and should be
defined as:

trapName NOTIFICATION-TYPE
        OBJECTS {
            ifIndex,
            eventReason,
            other useful objects
        }
        STATUS      current
        DESCRIPTION
            "trap description"
        ::= Object Id

Note that ifIndex is only included if the event or trap is interface
related.

The last digit of the trap OID for enterprise-specific traps must match
docsDevEvId.  For SNMPv1-capable Network Management systems, this is
necessary to correlate the event type to the trap type.  Many Network
Management systems are only capable of trap filtering on an enterprise
and single-last-digit basis.

3.2.3.  Trap Throttling

The CM and CMTS MUST provide support for trap message throttling as
described below.  The network operator can employ message rate
throttling or trap limiting by manipulating the appropriate MIB
variables.


3.2.3.1.  Trap rate throttling

Network operators may employ either of two rate control methods.  In the
first method, the device ceases to send traps when the rate exceeds the
specified maximum message rate.  It resumes sending traps only if
reactivated by a network management station request.

In the second method, the device resumes sending traps when the rate
falls below the specified maximum message rate.

The network operator configures the specified maximum message rate by
setting the measurement interval (in seconds), and the maximum number of
traps to be transmitted within the measurement interval.  The operator
can query the operational throttling state (to determine whether traps
are enabled or blocked by throttling) of the device, as well as query
and set the administrative throttling state (to manage the rate control
method) of the device.


3.2.3.2.  Limiting the trap rate

Network operators may wish to limit the number of traps sent by a device
over a specified time period.  The device ceases to send traps when the
number of traps exceeds the specified threshold.  It resumes sending
traps only when the measurement interval has passed.

The network operator defines the maximum number of traps he is willing
to handle and sets the measurement interval to a large number (in
hundredths of a second).  For this case, the administrative throttling
state is set to stop at threshold which is the maximum number of traps.

See "Techniques for Managing Asynchronously Generated Alerts" [7] for
further information.


3.3.  Protocol Filters

The Cable Device MIB provides objects for both LLC and IP protocol
filters.  The LLC protocol filter entries can be used to limit CM
forwarding to a restricted set of network-layer protocols (such as IP,
IPX, NetBIOS, and Appletalk).  The IP protocol filter entries can be
used to restrict upstream or downstream traffic based on source and
destination IP addresses, transport-layer protocols (such as TCP, UDP,
and ICMP), and source and destination TCP/UDP port numbers.

7.  Security Considerations

The docsDevNmAccessTable limits network management station access to
devices implementing this MIB, thus providing protection against
configuration changes imposed by unauthorized network management
stations.

It should be noted, however, that this protextion does not prevent
unauthorized access by using wrong IP source address information.  Also,
it should be noted that depending of the SNMP version in use the SNMP
data packets may be transmitted unencrypted.  Dealing with this kind of
security problems is outside the scope of this specification.
