      A Subregistry for urn:service:sos.police, fire and ambulance
             draft-rosen-ecrit-service-urn-subregistries-01

Abstract

   In most countries, there are multiple kinds of police forces.
   RFC5031 defines a "Service URN" which is used to route emergency
   calls.  The urn has a sub registry for different kinds of emergency
   services that may be reached from different telephone numbers or
   service numbers (as opposed to a single number like 112).  In many
   countries, the "police" service is not a single service, but more
   than one service where the service area and/or types of emergencies
   they respond to are different.  In some countries there are multiple
   ambulance services.  This document defines sub registries for
   urn:service:sos.police, urn:service:sos.ambulance and, for
   completeness, urn:service:sos.fire.  It also provides an initial set
   of entries for these sub registries.  These services are in addition
   to the base urn:service:sos.police, etc. services.

1.  IANA Considerations

1.1.  Police Force Types

   This document extends the urn:service:sos.police to allow the system
   to distinguish law enforcement agencies.  The type of law enforcement
   agency is a token separated from urn:service.sos.police by a period.
   The token names are suggestive of the names for different kinds of
   police forces but is not supposed to be the literal name of the
   force.

   IANA is requested to add a sub registry to the Service URN Labels
   under sos Sub-Services entitled sos.police Sub-Services.  The
   registry should have Service, Description and References as in the
   other sub registries for the service urn.  The Registration Procedure
   is Expert review.  The expert shall use the same criteria as the
   other urn:service:sos entries.  The initial values of the sub
   registry are:

1.6.  Government services top level entry

   IANA is requested to add a new entry to the URN Service Labels
   Registry:

   +------------+----------------------------------------+-------------+
   | Service    | Reference                              | Description |
   +------------+----------------------------------------+-------------+
   | government | non-emergency services offered by      | this        |
   |            | various branches of government         | document    |
   +------------+----------------------------------------+-------------+

                                  Table 6

1.7.  Government services sub registry

   IANA is requested to create a new 'government Sub-Services' sub
   registry in the URN Service Labels registry.  The 'government'
   service is used for general informational services that provide
   residents access and information about government services relevant
   to their current location.  For example, in the United States and
   Canada, 311 is used for this purpose.

   Additional sub-services can be added after expert review and must be
   of general public interest.  The expert is designated by the ECRIT
   working group, its successor, or, in their absence, the IESG.  The
   expert review should only approve government services that are
   offered widely and in different countries, with approximately the
   same caller expectation in terms of services rendered.

   A new entry must specify the service name, description and a
   reference similar to other Sub Registries in the URN Service Label
   registry.  The initial values in this sub registry are:

2.  Security Considerations

   This document has the same security considerations as those in
   [RFC5031].

3.  Acknowledgements

   Ivo Sedlacek described the problem and attempted to register a
   service with a specific police force as distinct from
   urn:service:sos.police.  This work was inspired by his problem.
