Internet-Draft             Manage TDM over PSN              October 2005


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a model for managing TDM pseudo wires, i.e.
   TDM data encapsulated for transmission over a Packet Switched Network
   (PSN).  The term TDM in this document is limited to the scope of PDH
   hierarchy.  It is currently specified to carry any TDM Signals in
   either Structure Agnostic Transport mode (E1, T1, E3 and T3) or in
   Structure Aware Transport mode (E1, T1 and NxDS0) as defined in PWE3
   TDM Requirements document [PWTDMREQ].

   This document is closely related to [SATOP], [TDMOIP] and [CESOPSN]
   which describe the encapsulation of TDM signals and provide the
   Circuit Emulation Service over a Packet Switched Network (PSN).

   The TDM management model consists of several MIB modules, following
   the layering model described in the PWE3 Architecture [PWARCH]
   document.  The TDM MIB module described in this document works
   closely with the MIB modules described in [DS3MIB], [DS1MIB],
   [DS0MIB], [IFMIB], [PWMIB] and the textual conventions defined in
   [PWTC].  The conceptual layering and relationship among all those is
   described in Figure 1 below.  A TDM connection will be a pseudo-wire
   (PW) connection.  It will not be treated as an interface and will
   therefore not be represented in the ifTable.

2.   Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [BCP14].

3.  Terminology

   The Basic terminology used to refer to transmission direction in this
   document is taken from [SATOP] draft that describes a mechanism for
   transporting Structure-Agnostic (TDM) bit-streams over a packet-
   oriented network.  For simplifying this document the terminology is
   used for structure and unstructured TDM as well.

   "PSN-bound" references the traffic direction where TDM data is
   received, adapted to packet based on number of payload bytes per
   packet, assigned a relevant TDM header (Sequence numbers, flags, and
   timestamps (if the RTP header is used)), prepended multiplexing layer
   and PSN headers and sent into the PSN.

   Conversely, The "CE-bound" references the traffic direction where
   packets are received from the PSN, packet payloads are reassembled by
   including a jitter buffer where payload of the received TDM packets
   is stored prior to play-out to the TDM line.  The size of this buffer
   SHOULD be locally configurable to allow accommodation to the PSN-
   specific packet delay variation.

   The CE-bound TDM inter-working function (IWF) SHOULD use the sequence
   number in the control word for detection of lost (LOPS) and mis-
   ordered packets.  If the RTP header is used, the RTP sequence numbers
   MAY be used for the same purposes.

4.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,

   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

5.  Overview

   This MIB module is designed to satisfy the following requirements and
   constraints:
   1.  Fits within the architecture defined by [PWARCH] and [PWMIB].
   2.  The MIB module supports edge-to-edge emulation of any TDM
       connections.
   3.  The MIB module configures the connection.  The connection
       specific behavior is provided via the supplement MIB modules.
   4.  The MIB module reports various alarms, counters and status
       objects.

6.  TDM MIB module usage

6.1  Structure of TDM MIB

   The MIB consists of five tables;

   -The TDM PW Table (pwVcTDMTable) contains generic TDM information
   regarding the PW connection.  It contains the ifIndex of the TDM
   interface, an index to an entry in the generic configuration table
   (pwVcTDMCfgTable), an index to an entry in the specific configuration
   table (pwVcXXXCfgTable, where XXX can be TDMoIP or CESoPSN), config
   error indications, and various status indications.  The two indices
   of the two configuration tables are providing the connection
   parameters.  The TDM interface can be a full link of any TDM type
   like E1 or DS3 for example, or the interface of the bundle holding
   the collection of time slots to be transmitted.  Based on the TDM PW
   type the relevant pwVcXXXCfgTable from the relevant MIB module will
   be used.  The specific types are:
   o  17   Structure-agnostic E1 over Packet
   o  18   Structure-agnostic T1 (DS1) over Packet
   o  19   Structure-agnostic E3 over Packet
   o  20   Structure-agnostic T3 (DS3) over Packet
   o  21   CESoPSN basic mode (XXX=CESoPSN)
   o  22   TDMoIP AAL1mode (XXX=TDMoIP)
   o  23   CESoPSN TDM with CAS (XXX=CESoPSN)
   o  24   TDMoIP AAL2 Mode (XXX=TDMoIP)

   - The TDM generic parameter Table (pwVcTDMCfgTable,  ) contains TDM
   generic configurable parameters for any TDM Type.

   - The TDM Performance Current Table (pwVcTDMPerfCurrentTable)
   contains TDM statistics for the current 15-minute period.

Internet-Draft             Manage TDM over PSN              October 2005


   - The TDM Performance Interval Table (pwVcTDMPerfIntervalTable)
   contains TDM statistics for historical intervals (usually 96 15-
   minute entries to cover a 24 hour period).

   - The TDM Performance Table (pwVcTDMPerfTable) contains TDM stats for
   statistics accumulated since the TDM PW was first established.

6.2  TDM Connection configuration Procedure

   Configuring a TDM PW involves the following steps:

   First Configure the parameters of the interface specific layer using
   DS1-MIB and or DS3-MIB.

   Next, if applicable, create a bundle of Time Slots using DS0 Bundle
   MIB [DS0MIB].

   Next, create an entry in the pwVcTable and configure the PSN tunnels:

   - Follow steps as defined in [PWMIB].

   NOTE: The agent should create an entry in the pwVcTDMTable for any
   entry created in the pwVcTable with pwVcType equal to a value between
   (17) to (24).

   Next complete the TDM PW configuration:

   - If necessary, create an entry in the relevant pwVcXXXCfgTable and
   in the pwVcTDMTable (suitable entries may already exist in both
   tables).

   - Set the index of the relevant pwVcXXXCfgTable entry and of the
   relevant pwVcTDMCfgTable entry in the pwVcTDMTable.

6.3  TDM PW Monitoring

   Upon making the TDM PW operational, the pwVcTDMPerfCurrentTable,
   pwVcTDMPerfIntervalTable, and pwVcTDMPerfTable can be used to monitor
   the various counters, indicators, and conditions of the PW.  All
   performance parameters are accumulated in fifteen minute intervals
   and up to 96 intervals (24 hours worth) are kept by an agent.  Fewer
   than 96 intervals of data will be available if the agent has been
   restarted within the last 24 hours.  In addition, there is a rolling
   running counters of each performance parameter.  Performance
   parameters continue to be collected when the interface is down.
   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure fixed relationship
   between the start of a fifteen minute interval and any wall clock;
   however some agents may align the fifteen minute intervals with

   quarter hours.  Performance parameters are of types PerfCurrentCount
   and PerfIntervalCount.  These textual conventions are all Gauge32,
   and they are used because it is possible for these objects to
   decrease.

7.  Example of actual TDM PW Setup

   This section provides an example of using the various MIB objects
   described in the following section to set up a TDM PW connection.

   First example, setting a connection of DS1 type.  Second example
   setting a connection with bandwidth of 3 DS0 (time slots).

   While those examples are not meant to illustrate all options of the
   MIB, they are intended as an aid to understanding some of the key
   concepts.  See [PWMIB] for an example of setting up PSN Tunnels.

   First example:
   1.  Configure the DS1 interface using DS1-MIB.
   2.  If needed, Create an entry in the pwVcTDMCfgTable (assuming index
       = 10); Verify that there are no errors in the configuration using
       the relevant object.
   3.  Get a new pwVcIndexNext [PWMIB] and create a new pwVcTable entry
       using the value of pwVcIndexNext (assume here, the PW index =
       20).
   4.  Set the pwVcType [PWMIB] of the new entry to the relevant value
       (17) or (18).  This should create a new entry in the
       pwVcTDMTable.
   5.  Configure the newly created TDM PW with the required pointers,
       indices, the relevant entry in pwVcTDMCfgTable (index 10).

     In pwVcTDMCfgTable entry: Set the connection characteristic
     parameters:

     {

     pwVcTDMCfgPayloadSize     = 43 -- payload bytes
     pwVcTDMCfgPktReorder      = FALSE
     pwVcTDMCfgRtpHdrUsed      = FALSE
     pwVcTDMCfgJtrBfrDepth     = 30000 -- micro-seconds

     }

     In pwVcTDMTable entry: Set the relevant ifIndex, the generic
     TDM Index and the specific TDM index to complete creation:

     {
       pwVcTDMIfIndex          = 5    -- IfIndex of associated entry
                                      -- in DS1 table
       pwVcGenTDMCfgIndex      = 10   -- Index of associated entry
                                      -- in pwVcTDMCfgTable.
       pwVcRelTDMCfgIndex      = 0    -- No Index in associated entry
                                      -- in pwVcXXXCfgTable.
     }

   Verify that there are no error bits set in pwVcTDMConfigError.

   Second example:
   1.  Configure the DS1 interface using DS1-MIB.
   2.  set up a bundle and get its dsx0BundleIfIndex.  Setting up the
       bundle should involve using IFMIB  properly.
   3.  Since structured TDMoIP circuit is defined, the next MIB module
       to be used is TDMoIP-MIB.
   4.  If needed, Create an entry in the pwVcTDMCfgTable (assuming index
       = 7):
   5.  If needed, Create an entry in the pwVcXXXCfgTable (index = 11).
       XXX can be TDMoIP or CESoPSN
   6.  Verify that there are no error in the configuration using the
       relevant object.
   7.  Get a new pwVcIndexNext [PWMIB] and create a new pwVcTable entry
       using the value of pwVcIndexNext.
   8.  Set the pwVcType [PWMIB] of the new entry to (24).  This should
       create a new entry in the pwVcTDMTable.
   9.  Configure the newly created TDM PW with the required pointers,
       indices and the relevant entries in pwVcTDMCfgTable and in
       pwVcXXXCfgTable (assuming indexes 7 and  11).

     TDM Index and the specific TDM index to complete creation:

     {
       pwVcTDMIfIndex          =  8   -- IfIndex of associated entry
                                      -- in DS0 table
       pwVcGenTDMCfgIndex      =  7   -- Index of associated entry
                                      -- in pwVcTDMCfgTable.

          as for lost packets.

          -Excessive packet loss rate is detected by computing the
          average packet loss rate over the value of
          pwVcTDMAvePktLossTimeWindow and comparing it with a
          preconfigured threshold [SATOP].

          when the CE bound IWF's jitter buffer cannot accommodate
          newly arrived packets.

          -Remote packet loss is indicated by reception of packets with
          their R bit set.

          -Packet misorder is detected by looking at the Sequence
          number provided by the control word.

          -TDM Fault, if L bit in the control word is set, it indicates
          that TDM data carried in the payload is invalid due an
          attachment circuit fault.  When the L bit is set the payload
          MAY be omitted in order to conserve bandwidth.

9.  Security considerations

   It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for monitoring
   of TDM PWs.  This MIB can also be used for configuration of certain
   objects, and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly
   configured, with potentially disastrous results.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The pwVcTDMTable and pwVcTDMCfgTable contain objects of TDM PW
   parameters on a Provider Edge (PE) device.  Unauthorized access to
   objects in these tables could result in disruption of traffic on the
   network.

   The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be
   considered where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be
   used with any SNMPV3 agent, which implements this MIB module.
   Administrators should consider whether read access to these objects
   should be allowed, since read access may be undesirable under certain
   circumstances.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module "i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible" may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The pwVcTDMTable, pwVcTDMPerfCurrentTable, pwVcTDMPerfIntervalTable
   and pwVcTDMPerfTable collectively show the TDM pseudo wire
   connectivity topology and its performance characteristics.

   If an Administrator does not want to reveal this information, then
   these tables should be considered sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec",
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the objects
   in this MIB module.

Internet-Draft             Manage TDM over PSN              October 2005


   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework "see [RFC3410], section 8",
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms "for
   authentication and privacy".

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals "users" that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET "change/create/delete" them.

10.  IANA considerations

   As requested in the PW TC MIB [PWTC], PWE3 related standards track
   MIB modules should be rooted under the pwStdMIB subtree.  The IANA is
   requested to assign { pwStdMIB 7 } to the PW TDM MIB module specified
   in this document.
