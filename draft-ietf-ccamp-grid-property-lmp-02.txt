1.  Introduction

   ITU-T [G.694.1] introduces the flexible-grid DWDM technique, which
   provides a new tool that operators can implement to provide a higher
   degree of network optimization than is possible with fixed-grid
   systems.  A flexible-grid network supports allocating a variable-
   sized spectral slot to a channel.  Flexible-grid DWDM transmission
   systems can allocate their channels with different spectral
   bandwidths/slot widths so that they can be optimized for the
   bandwidth requirements of the particular bit rate and modulation
   scheme of the individual channels.  This technique is regarded to be
   a promising way to improve the spectrum utilization efficiency and
   can be used in the beyond 100Gbit/s transport systems.

   Fixed-grid DWDM system is regarded as a special case of Flexi-grid
   DWDM.  It is expected that fixed-grid optical nodes will be gradually
   replaced by flexible nodes and interworking between fixed-grid DWDM
   and flexible-grid DWDM nodes will be needed as the network evolves.
   Additionally, even two flexible-grid optical nodes may have different
   grid properties based on the filtering component characteristics,
   thus need to negotiate on the specific parameters to be used during
   neighbor discovery process [FLEX-FWK].  This document describes the
   extensions to the Link Management Protocol (LMP) to negotiate a link
   grid property between two adjacent nodes before the link is brought
   up.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   For the flexible-grid DWDM, the spectral resource is called frequency
   slot which is represented by the central frequency and the slot
   width.  The definition of nominal central frequency, nominal central
   frequency granularity, slot width and slot width granularity can be
   referred to [FLEX-FWK].

   In this contribution, some other definitions are listed below:

   Tuning range: It describes the supported spectrum slot range of the
   switching nodes or interfaces.  It is represented by the supported
   minimal slot width and the maximum slot width.

   Channel spacing: It is used in traditional fixed-grid network to
   identify spectrum spacing between two adjacent channels.

3.  Requirements for Grid Property Negotiation

3.1.  Flexi-fixed Grid Nodes Interworking

   Figure 1 shows an example of interworking between flexible and fixed-
   grid nodes.  Node A, B, D and E support flexible-grid.  All these
   nodes can support frequency slots with a central frequency
   granularity of 6.25 GHz and slot width granularity of 12.5 GHz.
   Given the flexibility in flexible-grid nodes, it is possible to
   configure the nodes in such a way that the central frequencies and
   slot width parameters are backwards compatible with the fixed DWDM
   grids (adjacent flexible frequency slots with channel spacing of

   8*6.25 and slot width of 4*12.5 GHz is equivalent to fixed DWDM grids
   with channel spacing of 50 GHz).

   As node C can only support the fixed-grid DWDM property with channel
   spacing of 50 GHz, to establish a LSP through node B, C, D, the links
   between B to C and C to D must set to align with the fixed-grid
   values.  This link grid property must be negotiated before
   establishing the LSP.

3.2.  Flexible-Grid Capability Negotiation

   The updated version of ITU-T [G.694.1] has defined the flexible-grid
   with a central frequency granularity of 6.25 GHz and a slot width
   granularity of 12.5 GHz.  However, devices or applications that make
   use of the flexible-grid may not be able to support every possible
   slot width or position.  In other words, applications may be defined
   where only a subset of the possible slot widths and positions are
   required to be supported.  Taking node G in figure 3 as an example,
   an application could be defined where the nominal central frequency
   granularity is 12.5 GHz (by only requiring values of n that are even)
   requiring slot widths being multiple of 25 GHz (by only requiring

   values of m that are even).  Therefore the link between two optical
   node F and G with different grid granularity must be configured to
   align with the larger of both granularities.  Besides, different
   nodes may have different slot width tuning ranges.  For example, in
   figure 3, node F can only support slot width with tuning change from
   12.5 to 100 GHz, while node G supports tuning range from 25 GHz to
   200 GHz.  The link property of slot width tuning range for the link
   between F and G should be chosen as the range intersection, resulting
   in a range from 25 GHz to 100 GHz.

3.3.  Summary

   In summary, in a DWDM Link between two nodes, the following
   properties should be negotiated:

   o Grid capability: flexible grid or fixed grid DWDM.

   o Nominal central frequency granularity: a multiplier of 6.25 GHz.

   o Slot width granularity: a multiplier of 12.5 GHz.

   o Slot width tuning range: two multipliers of 12.5GHz, each indicate
   the minimal and maximal slot width supported by a port respectively.

4.  LMP extensions

4.1.  Grid Property Subobject

   According to [RFC4204], the LinkSummary message is used to verify the
   consistency of the link property on both sides of the link before it
   is brought up.  The LinkSummary message contains negotiable and non-
   negotiable DATA_LINK objects, carrying a series of variable-length
   data items called subobjects, which illustrate the detailed link
   properties.  The subobjects are defined in Section 12.12.1 in
   [RFC4204].

   To meet the requirements stated in section 3, this draft extends the
   LMP protocol by introducing a new DATA_LINK subobject called "Grid
   property", allowing the grid property correlation between adjacent
   nodes.  The encoding format of this new subobject is as follows:

   The value is used to represent which grid the node/interface

   C.F.G (central frequency granularity):

   It is a positive integer.  Its value indicates the multiple of 6.25
   GHz in terms of central frequency granularity.

   S.W.G (Slot Width Granularity):

   It is a positive integer value which indicates the slot width
   granularity which is the multiple of 12.5 GHz.

   Min Width and Max Width:

   Min Width and Max Width are positive integers.  Their value indicate
   the multiple of 12.5 GHz in terms of the slot width tuning range the
   interface supports.  For example, for slot width tuning range from 25
   GHz to 100 GHz (with regard to a node with slot width granularity of
   12.5 GHz), the values of Min Width and Max Width should be 2 and 8
   respectively.  For fixed-grid nodes, these two fields are meaningless
   and should be set to zero.

5.  Messages Exchange Procedure

5.1.  Flexi-fixed Grid Nodes Messages Exchange

   To demonstrate the procedure of grid property correlation, the model
   shown in Figure 1 is reused.  Node B starts sending messages.

   o After inspecting its own node/interface property, node B sends node
   C a LinkSummary message including the MESSAGE ID, TE_LINK ID and
   DATA_LINK objects.  The setting and negotiating of MESSAGE ID and
   TE_link ID can be referenced to [RFC4204].  As node B supports
   flexible-grid property, the Grid and C.F.G values in the grid
   property subobject are set to be 3 (i.e., ITU-T Flex) and 1
   (i.e.,1*6.25GHz) respectively.  The slot width tuning range is from
   12.5 GHz to 200 GHz (i.e., Min Width=1, Max Width=16).  Meanwhile,
   the N bit of the DATA_LINK object is set to 1, indicating that the
   property is negotiable.

   o When node C receives the LinkSummary message from B, it checks the
   Grid, C.F.G, Min and Max values in the grid property subobject.  Node
   C can only support fixed-grid DWDM and realizes that the flexible-
   grid property is not acceptable for the link.  Since the receiving N
   bit in the DATA_LINK object is set, indicating that the Grid property
   of B is negotiable, node C responds to B with a LinkSummaryNack
   containing a new Error_code object and state that the property of the
   interface connected to node B needs further negotiation.  Meanwhile,
   an accepted grid property subobject (Grid=2, C.F.G=4, fixed DWDM with
   channel spacing of 50 GHz) is carried in LinkSummaryNack message.  At
   this moment, the N bit in the DATA_LINK object is set to 0,
   indicating that the grid property subobject is non-negotiable.

   o As the channel spacing and slot width of the corresponding
   interface of node B can be configured to be any integral multiples of
   6.25 GHz and 12.5 GHz respectively, node B supports the fixed DWDM
   values announced by node C.  Consequently, node B will resend the
   LinkSummary message carrying the grid property subobject with values
   of Grid=2 and C.F.G=4.

Internet-Draft            GMPLS Flexi-grid LMP              October 2015


   o Once received the LinkSummary message from node B, node C replies
   with a LinkSummaryACK message.  After the message exchange, the link
   between node B and C is brought up with a fixed channel spacing of 50
   GHz.

   In the above mentioned grid property correlation scenario, the node
   supporting a flexible-grid is the one that starts sending LMP
   messages.  The procedure where the initiator is the fixed-grid node
   is as follows:

   o After inspecting its own interface property, Node C sends B a
   LinkSummary message containing a grid property subobject with Grid=2,
   C.F.G=4.  The N bit in the DATA_LINK object is set to 0, indicating
   that it is non-negotiable.

   o As the channel spacing and slot width of node B can be configured
   to be any integral multiples of 6.25 GHz and 12.5 GHz respectively,
   node B is able to support the fixed DWDM parameters.  Then, node B
   will make appropriate configuration and reply node C the
   LinkSummaryACK message

   o After the message exchange, the link between node B and C is
   brought up with a fixed channel spacing of 50 GHz.

5.2.  Flexible Nodes Messages Exchange

   To demonstrate the procedure of grid property correlation between to
   flexi-grid capable nodes, the model shown in figure 3 is reused.  The
   procedure of grid property correlation (negotiating the grid
   granularity and slot width tuning range) is similar to the scenarios
   mentioned above.

   o The Grid, C.F.G, Min and Max values in the grid property subobject
   sent from node F to G are set to be 3,1,1,8 respectively.  Meanwhile,
   the N bit of the DATA_LINK object is set to 1, indicating that the
   grid property is negotiable.

   o When node G has received the LinkSummary message from F, it will
   analyze the Grid, C.F.G, Min and Max values in the Grid property
   subobject.  But the corresponding interface of node G can only
   support grid granularity of 12.5 GHz and a slotwdith tuning range
   from 25 GHz to 200 GHz.  Considering the interface property of node
   F, node G will first match these property with its corresponding
   interface, and then judge the mismatch of the property of the link
   between node F and G, then respond F a LinkSummaryNack containing a
   new Error_code object and state that the property need further
   negotiation.  Meanwhile, an accepted grid property subobject (Grid=3,

   intersection of Node F and G) is carried in LinkSummaryNack message.
   Meanwhile, the N bit in the DATA_LINK object is set to 1, indicating
   that the grid property subobject is non-negotiable.

   o As the channel spacing and slot width of the corresponding
   interface of node F can be configured to be any integral multiples of
   6.25 GHz and 12.5 GHz respectively, node F can support the lager
   granularity.  The suggested slot width tuning range is acceptable for
   node F.  In consequence, node F will resend the LinkSummary message
   carrying the grid subobject with values of Grid=3, C.F.G=2, Min=2 and
   Max=8.

   o Once received the LinkSummary message from node F, node G replies
   with a LinkSummaryACK message.  After the message exchange, the link
   between node F and G is brought up supporting central frequency
   granularity of 12.5 GHz and slot width tuning range from 25 GHz to
   100 GHz.

   From the perspective of the control plane, once the links have been
   brought up, wavelength constraint information can be advertised and
   the wavelength label can be assigned hop-by-hop when establishing a
   LSP based on the link grid property.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This draft introduces the following new assignments:

   LMP Sub-Object Class names:

   o under DATA_LINK Class name (as defined in [RFC4204])

   - Grid property type (sub-object Type = TBD.)

7.  Acknowledgments

   This work was supported in part by the China NSFC Project 61201260.

8.  Security Considerations

   LMP message security uses IPsec, as described in [RFC4204].  This
   document only defines new LMP objects that are carried in existing
   LMP messages.  As such, this document introduces no other new
   security considerations not covered in [RFC4204].
