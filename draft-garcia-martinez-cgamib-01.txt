1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual
   information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the
   mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2,
   which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579
   [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].


2.  Overview

   This document defines the portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) to be used for managing Cryptographically Generated Addresses
   (CGA) [RFC3972].  CGA addresses are IPv6 addresses for which the
   interface identifier is generated by computing a one-way hash
   function from a public signature key and some auxiliary parameters.

   The cgaLocalTable includes the information related to the CGA
   addresses configured as local addresses in the system (i.e. local to
   the system).  These CGA can be used by any protocol requiring CGA
   configured as local addresses, such as SEND or SHIM6.  This table
   contains CGA-specific information such as the elements of the CGA
   Parameters data structure.  More information related to the address
   can be obtained from the corresponding entries at the ipAddressTable
   [RFC4293].  CGA addresses are represented as an InetAddressIPv6 type
   defined in [RFC4001].  Managers can create new entries in the table
   to configure the node with new CGA addresses.  A discrete spin lock
   object is used to coordinate the creation of rows by different
   managers.  The table also includes a columnar object that indicates
   the protocols that are currently using the local CGA.

   The cgaRemoteTable contains information related to CGA addresses of
   remote systems.  Different protocols (e.g.  SEND or SHIM6) or means
   can be used to convey this information to the managed node, and many
   of these protocols can be using a given CGA at the same time.  The
   table contains the address represented as an InetAddressIPv6 type,
   and the elements of the CGA Parameters Data structure.  The table
   also includes a columnar object that indicates the protocols that are
   currently using the local CGA.

              The administrator can create a new row by setting
              appropriate values to the parameters that are used to
              build the CGA: cgaLocalModifier, cgaLocalCollisionCount,
              cgaLocalPublicKey, cgaLocalPrivateKey and
              cgaLocalExtensionFields.  Additionally the corresponding
              entry in the IP-MIB:ipAddressTable must have the IP-
              MIB:ipAddressRowStatus set to active(1) before or at the
              same time as the cgaLocalOperStatus object of the entry is
              set to validAndEnabled(1).  Note that if the address
              should only be used as a CGA, the operations of setting
              the IP-MIB:ipAddressRowStatus columnar object to active(1)
              and the cgaLocalOperStatus to validAndEnabled(1) should be
              performed atomically.  The removal of an entry in the
              cgaLocalTable does not automatically require the removal
              of the corresponding entry in the IP-
              MIB:ipAddressAddrType, because the address may remain
              operational even if it is not usable as a CGA.  Once the
              value of the cgaLocalOperStatus of an entry has been set
              once to validAndEnabled(1), the cgaLocalModifier,

              cgaLocalPrivateKey and cgaLocalExtensionFields columnar
              objects of the entry must remain unmodified.
              The removal of an entry of the IP-MIB:ipAddressTable must
              result in the removal of the corresponding entry in the
              cgaLocalTable.
              The agent may generate new entries if they are configured

4.  Security Considerations

   Some of the management objects of this MIB module have been defined
   with either a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-create (for the columnar
   objects belonging to the cgaLocalTable) or read-write (for the
   spinlock object to control access to that table).  Such access
   capability may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   The objects of the cgaLocalTable specify the CGA addresses configured
   in this node.  An attacker could delete or disable the entry
   associated to a CGA to prevent the node to benefit from the
   authentication and certification facilities provided by the
   combination of the CGA addresses and protocols such as SeND (RFC3972)
   or SHIM6.

   The addition by an attacker of a row composed of consistent
   information about a CGA could allow the node to be able to
   impersonate the identity of another node.

   Regarding to the risks of providing GET access to the tables defined
   in this MIB, relevant risks arise from the fact that the private key
   (contained in the cgaLocalPrivateKey object) could be disclosed.
   Some implementations not providing write access to the CGA elements
   may also disable read access to the cgaLocalPrivateKey object.  The
   rest of the information contained in the cgaLocalTable is used to
   prove the identity of the node considered to other nodes
   communicating with it.  Therefore, the disclosure of this information
   does not provide great advantage for an attacker in order to
   impersonate the identity of the node (unless factoring attacks become
   practical, and the private key could be derived from the public one,
   in which case the CGA should be changed).  Other risks are
   essentially the same as faced by the knowledge of a set of non-CGA,
   i.e. being able to correlate traffic from different addresses.
   Analogous considerations can be stated for the information contained
   in the cgaRemoteTable.

Internet-Draft                   CGA MIB                   December 2008


   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:


         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------

         send-MIB          { mib-2 XXX }


   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.
