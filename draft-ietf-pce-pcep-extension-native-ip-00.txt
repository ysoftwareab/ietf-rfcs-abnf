Internet-Draft   PCEP Extension for Native IP Network  June 26, 2018
   This document defines the PCEP extension for CCDR application in
   Native IP network. The scenario and architecture of CCDR in native
   IP is described in [draft-ietf-teas-native-ip-scenarios] and [draft-
   ietf-teas-pce-native-ip]. This draft describes the key information
   that is transferred between PCE and PCC to accomplish the end2end
   traffic assurance in Native IP network under central control mode.

1. Introduction

   Traditionally, MPLS-TE traffic assurance requires the corresponding
   network devices support MPLS or the complex RSVP/LDP/Segment Routing
   etc. technologies to assure the end-to-end traffic performance. But
   in native IP network, there will be no such signaling protocol to
   synchronize the action among different network devices. It is
   necessary to use the central control mode that described in [draft-
   ietf-teas-pce-control-function] to correlate the forwarding behavior
   among different network devices. Draft [draft-ietf-teas-pce-native-
   ip] describes the architecture and solution philosophy for the
   end2end traffic assurance in Native IP network via Dual/Multi BGP
   solution. This draft describes the corresponding PCEP extension to
   transfer the key information about peer address list, peer prefix
   association and the explicit peer route on on-path router.

2. Conventions used in this document

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3. New Objects Extension

   Three new objects are defined in this draft; they are Peer Address
   List Object (PAL Object), Peer Prefix Association Object (PPA Object)
   and Explicit Peer Route object (EPR Object).

   Peer Address List object is used to tell the network device which
   peer it should be peered with dynamically, Peer Prefix Association
   is used to tell which prefixes should be advertised via the
   corresponding peer and Explicit Peer Route object is used to point
   out which route should be to taken to arrive to the peer.

4. Object Formats.

   Each extension object takes the similar format, that is to say, it
   began with the common object header defined in [RFC5440] as the
   following:

       0                   1                   2                   3

      |                                                               |

      //                        (Object body)                        //

      |                                                               |

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Different object-class, object type and the corresponding object
   body is defined separated in the following section.

4.1. Peer Address List object.

   The Peer Address List object is used in a PCE Initiate message
   [draft-ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] to specify the ip address of peer
   that the received network device should establish the BGP
   relationship with.

   This Object should only be sent to the head and end router of the
   end2end path in case there is no RR involved. If the RR is used

   between the head end routers, then such information should be sent
   to head router/RR and end router/RR respectively.
