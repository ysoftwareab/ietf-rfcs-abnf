1.  Introduction

   Virtual Subnet [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-virtual-subnet] is a BGP/MPLS IP VPN
   [RFC4364] -based subnet extension solution which is intended for
   building Layer3 network virtualization overlays within and/or across
   data centers.  In the Virtual Subnet context, since CE host routes of
   a given VPN instance need to be exchanged among PE routers
   participating in that VPN instance, the resulting forwarding table
   (a.k.a.  FIB) size of PE routers may become a big concern in large-
   scale data center environment where they may need to install a huge
   amount of host routes into their forwarding tables.  In some cases
   where host routes need to be maintained on the control plane, it
   needs a method to reduce the FIB size of PE routers without any
   change to the RIB and the routing table.  Therefore, this document
   proposes a very simple mechanism for reducing the FIB size of PE
   routers.  The basic idea of this mechanism is: Those host routes
   learnt from remote PE routers are selectively installed into the FIB
   while the remaining routes including local CE host routes are
   installed into the FIB by default as before.

               Figure 1: Selective FIB Installation Example

   To reduce the FIB size of PE routers, the selective FIB installation
   concept as described in [I-D.ietf-grow-va] can be leveraged in the
   Virtual Subnet context.  Take the VPN instance demonstrated in

Internet-Draft       FIB Reduction in Virtual Subnet        January 2015


   Figure 1 as an example, the FIB reduction procedures are described as
   follows:

   1.  Multiple more specific prefixes (e.g., 1.1.1.0/25 and
       1.1.1.128/25) corresponding to an extended subnet (i.e.,
       1.1.1.0/24) are specified as Virtual Prefixes (VPs).  Meanwhile,
       one or more PE routers (or route reflectors) are configured as
       Aggregation Point Routers (APR) for each VP.  The APRs for a
       given VP would install a null route to that VP while propagating
       a route to that VP via the L3VPN signaling.

   2.  For a given host route in the routing table which is learnt from
       any remote PE router, PE routers which are non-APRs for any VP
       covering this host route would not install it into the FIB by
       default.  In contrast, PE routers (or route reflectors) which are
       APRs for any VP covering that host route would install it into
       the FIB.  If one or more particular remote host routes need to be
       installed by non-APR PE routers by default as well for whatever
       reasons, the best way to realize such goal is to attach a special
       extended communities attribute to those particular host routes
       either by originating PE routers or by route reflectors.  Upon
       receiving any host routes attached with the above extended
       communities attribute, non-APR PE routers SHOULD install them by
       default.

   3.  Upon receiving a packet destined for a given remote CE host, if
       no host route for that CE host is found in the FIB, the ingress
       PE router would forward the packet to a given APR according to
       the longest-matching VP route, which in turn forwards the packet
       to the final egress PE router.  In this way, the FIB size of
       those non-APR PE routers can be greatly reduced at the potential
       cost of path stretch.

   In order to forward packets destined for remote CE hosts directly to
   the final egress PE routers without the potential path stretch
   penalty, non-APR PE routers could perform on-demand FIB installation
   for remote host routes which are available in the routing table.  For
   example, upon receiving an ARP request or Neighbor Solicitation (NS)
   message from a local CE host, the non-APR PE router would perform a
   lookup in the routing table.  If a corresponding host route for the
   target host is found but not yet installed into the FIB, it would be
   installed into the FIB.  Another possible way to trigger on-demand
   FIB installation is as follows: when receiving a packet whose
   longest-matching FIB entry is a particular VP route learnt from any
   APR, a copy of this packet would be sent to the control plane while
   this original packet is forwarded as normal.  The above copy sent to
   the control plane would trigger a lookup in the routing table.  If a
   corresponding host route is found but not yet installed into the FIB,

   it would be installed into the FIB.  To provide robust protection
   against DoS attacks on the control plane, rate-limiting of the above
   packets sent to the control plane MUST be enabled.  Those FIB entries
   for remote CE host routes which are on-demand installed on non-APR PE
   routers would expire if not used for a certain period of time.
