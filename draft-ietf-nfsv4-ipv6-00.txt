Internet-Draft            draft-ietf-nfsv4-ipv6             October 2010


1.  Terminology

   Host: Used to refer to the client or the server where the specific(s)
   of client or the server does not matter.

   IPv4: Internet Protocol Version 4.

   IPv6: Internet Protocol Version 6.

   NFS: Used to refer to Network File System irrespective of the
   version.

   NFSv2: Network File System Protocol Version 2.

   NFSv3: Network File System Protocol version 3.

   NFSv4: Network File System Protocol version 4.

   NFSv4.1: Network File System Protocol version 4.1.

   NLM: Network Lock Manager Protocol.

   NSM: Network Status Monitor Protocol.

   Operation: Refers to the NFS operation when its mode of request or
   response is inconsequential.


2.  Introduction

   NFS being a application layer protocol can operate over several
   network layer protocols.  This draft addresses problems associated
   with NFS operation over an IPv6 only network.


3.  RPCBIND

   NFS servers supporting IPv6 MUST support RPCBINDv3 as defined in
   [RFC1833], over IPv6.  Additionally, RPCBINDv4 SHOULD be supported,
   as noted later in this section.

   RPCBINDv3/4 protocols 'use a transport-independent format for the
   transport address'.  Using RPCBINDv3/4, a client can clearly
   communicate to the server which transport (IPv4/v6, TCP/UDP) it is
   interested in for contacting a service.  The server can communicate
   clearly to the client, the various transports on which a service is
   available.  RPCBINDv2 (aka PORTMAP) provides limited support in this
   area.

   RPCBINDv4 SHOULD be supported because it introduces useful procedures
   --

   o RPCBPROC_GETVERSADDR - to query the server for the address of a
   specific version of an RPC service.

   o RPCBPROC_GETADDRLIST - to query the server for a list of all
   addresses / transports on which an RPC service is available.

   Clients SHOULD use those procedures wherever those procedures enable
   them to get the information of interest in one go, instead of making
   multiple RPCBPROC_GETADDR calls.

   The netid and address formats in the RPCBINDv3/4 procedures, MUST be
   as per those defined for netid and universal addresses, in netid_ID
   draft [netid_ID].  The implementation MUST NOT use IPv4 embedded IPv6
   addresses defined in Section 2.5.5 [RFC4291], for the RPCBINDv3/4
   procedures.

   An NFS client SHOULD specify a proper universal address in a
   RPCBPROC_GETADDR call; specifically, it SHOULD match the server's IP
   address on which the client made the call.

   While processing the RPCBPROC_GETADDR call, the NFS server needs to
   know which local address the client is querying on; the server SHOULD
   pull that address from the network layer instead (the local address
   on which the RPCBPROC_GETADDR call was received; similar to what
   [RFC1833] recommends for the "r_netid" parameter -

   The "r_netid" field of the argument is ignored and the "r_netid" is
   inferred from the network identifier of the transport on which the
   request came in.)


4.  NFSv4 Callback Information

   In the case of NFSv4.0 procedure SETCLIENTID, the netid and address
   formats in the callback information MUST be as per those defined for
   netid and universal addresses, in netid_ID draft [netid_ID].  The
   implementation MUST NOT use IPv4 embedded IPv6 addresses defined in
   Section 2.5.5 [RFC4291].


5.  Handling of link-local addresses in  multi-homed hosts

   [RFC4007] describes link-local IPv6 addresses.

   There may be environments where hosts operate only with auto-

Internet-Draft            draft-ietf-nfsv4-ipv6             October 2010


   configured (link-local) addresses.  NFS implementations SHOULD
   support link-local addresses, so they can operate in such
   environments.  For example, hosts booting over the network, via NFS.
   However, since link-local addresses are link-scoped, they can cause
   ambiguity on multi-homed hosts.

   An NFS implementation on a multi-homed host MUST keep track of the
   local interface (zone) when communicating with a link-local address
   of another host.  Alternately, such hosts can support a default zone,
   which the network layer can use when no interface info is specified
   explicitly.  See the 'Scope Zones' section of RFC 4007 [RFC4007] for
   more on (scope) zones and their implementation.

   While making a callback to an address received in a NLM LOCK call or
   a NFSv4 SETCLIENTID call, a server MUST specify the local interface
   via which the call needs to be made (or let the default zone be
   selected, if supported).

   An NFS implementation on multi-homed hosts MUST also make sure that a
   link-local address of any one of it's (local) interfaces is not
   advertised out in any way, via any of it's other (local) interfaces.
   For instance, the address list that a NFS server returns in a
   RPCBPROC_GETADDRLIST response, MUST NOT contain a link-local address
   any interface other than the one on which the request was received
   (which will be same as the one which the response is being sent out).


6.  Acknowledgments
