Interface Stack Table Definition for Point to Point (P2P) Interface over
                                  LAN
                      draft-liu-lsr-p2poverlan-03

Abstract

   In [RFC5309] defines the Point to Point (P2P) circuit type is one of
   the mainly used circuit types in link state routing protocol, and
   highlights it is important to identify the correct circuit type when
   forming adjacencies, flooding link state database packets, and
   monitor the link state.

   Point to Point (P2P) Interface over LAN ifType value is assigned by
   IANA experts review.  This document provides an example of the
   ifStack for Point to Point (P2P) Interface over LAN ifType to
   facilitate operational control, maintenance and statistics.

1.  Introduction

   The assignment of a value (303, available at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers/smi-numbers.xhtml#smi-
   numbers-5) to p2pOverLan ifType was made by expert review.  To
   simplify configuration and operational control, it is helpful to
   represent the fact that an interface is to be considered a Point to
   Point (P2P) Interface over LAN type explicitly in the interface
   stack.  This enables, for example, routing protocols to automatically
   inherit the correct operating mode from interface stack without
   further configuration(Not need to explicitly configure Point to Point
   Interface in routing protocols).

   So it is helpful to map Point to Point (P2P) Interface over LAN type
   in interface management stack table.  And if no entry specify Point
   to Point (P2P) Interface lower layer, the management will suffer
   since lose the ability to get to the lower layer specific management
   properties via many tools.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] [RFC8174].

3.  Interface Stack Table for Point to Point (P2P) Interface Type

   If the device implements the IF-MIB [RFC2863], each entry in the
   "/interfaces/interface" list (in "Interface Management YANG") in the
   operational state is typically mapped to one ifEntry is required in
   [RFC8343], therefore Point to Point (P2P) Interface over LAN type
   should also fully map to one ifEntry by defining the "ifStackTable"
   ("higher-layer-if" and "lower-layer-if").

   Point to Point (P2P) interface higher layer should be network layer
   "ipForward" (defined in IANA) to run routing protocol, Point to Point
   (P2P) interface lower layer is link data layer "ethernetCsmacd"
   (defined in IANA).

   Point to Point (P2P) interface type ifStackTable can be defined along
   the lines of following example which complies with [RFC8343]:

                    <interface>
                      <name>isis_int</name>
                      <type>ianaift:ipForward</type>
                    </interface>

                    <interface>
                      <name>eth1</name>
                      <type>ianaift:ethernetCsmacd</type>
                    </interface>

                    <interface>
                      <name>p2p</name>
                      <type>ianaift:p2pOverLan</type>
                      <higher-layer-if>isis_int</higher-layer-if>
                      <lower-layer-if>eth1</lower-layer-if>
                      <enabled>false</enabled>
                      <admin-status>down</admin-status>
                      <oper-status>down</oper-status>
                      <statistics>
                        <discontinuity-time>
                          2021-04-01T03:00:00+00:00
                        </discontinuity-time>
                        <!-- counters now shown here -->
                      </statistics>
                    </interface>

4.  Security Considerations

   The interface stack table specified in this document is read-only.
   Read operation to this table without complete protection shouldn't
   have a negative effect on network operations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   In the Interface Types registry, IANA has previously assigned a value
   of 303 for p2pOverLan with a reference of [RFC5309], as shown in
   following table (available at https://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-
   numbers/smi-numbers.xhtml#smi-numbers-5).  IANA is requested to amend
   the reference to point to this document and to make a similar
   amendment in the YANG iana-if-type module [RFC7224] which currently
   points to [RFC8561], as this document explains how the ifType is to
   be used.
