Abstract

   The purpose of this paper is to describe an AAA protocol designed for
   NEMO services.  The proposed AAA protocol retains the NEMO mobility
   transparency in the NEMO basic support protocol, while providing all
   the required AAA functionalities for mobile network nodes.  In
   addition, the proposed AAA protocol reduces authentication latency by
   localizing AAA process.

1.  Introduction

   According to NEMO terminologies [1], a mobile network (NEMO) is
   defined as a network whose point of attachment to the Internet varies
   as it moves about.  A NEMO consists of mobile routers (MRs) and
   mobile network nodes (MNNs).  Each NEMO has a home network to which
   its home address belongs.  When a NEMO is in its home network, the
   NEMO is identified by its home address (HoA).  On the other hand, the
   NEMO configures a care-of-address (CoA) on the egress link when the
   NEMO is away from the home network.  At the same time, on the ingress
   link, the MNNs of the NEMO configures CoAs, which are derived from
   the subnet prefix (i.e.  NEMO prefix) in the home network.  This NEMO
   prefix remains assigned to the NEMO while it is away from the home
   network.  The assigned NEMO prefix is registered with the home agent
   (HA) by the NEMO basic support protocol [2].

   To make NEMO services feasible in public wireless Internet, well-
   defined authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) protocols
   should be accompanied.  However, to the best of our knowledge, no
   specific AAA protocols have been proposed for NEMO support.  Even if
   a number of AAA protocols have been proposed for host mobility, all
   of them are based on per-node AAA operations.  Therefore, it cannot
   directly applied to NEMO environments containing both local fixed
   nodes (LFNs) and visiting mobile nodes (VMNs).  In this document, we
   propose a novel AAA protocol that provides efficient AAA procedures
   in NEMO environments.

2.  Terms and Abbreviations

2.1  General Terms

   The attendant extracts identification and authorization data sent by
   the MR or the VMN and forwards them to AAAL in order to request
   authentication.

   AAAH : AAA server of the home network.

   AAAL : AAA server of the foreign network.

   MR : mobile router.

   AR : access router.

   MNN : mobile network node.  MNNs such as VMN and LFN are nodes in a
   NEMO.

   MN : mobile node [4].

2.2  Payloads

   LC (local challenge) : a challenge issued by the attendant.  This is
   a random number for authentication procedures.

   NAI (network access identifier) : identitiy of MR or VMN.  MRs and

   the key in the pre-defined SA with its AAAH.  The encrypted value is
   called as a credential.

   CR_L (Local Credential) : an AAA credential which is used by the AAAL
   to authenticate the MR.  The MR encrypts the LC using the key_local.

          Figure 1. NEMO AAA Architecture

   Figure 1 illustrates a reference architecture for AAA in NEMO
   environments, which is similar to that of Mobile IPv6 [4,5].  The AAA
   architecture is based on the DIAMETER protocol [3].

   The AAA architecture consists of multiple autonomous wireless
   networks, each of which is called a domain.  Each domain has an AAAH
   server and/or an AAAL server in order to authenticate any node in a
   DIAMETER-compliant manner.  The AAAH server of the MR has the profile
   of the MR and it shares a long-term key with the MR.  Likewise, the
   AAAH server of the VMN shares a long-term key with the VMN.  The AAAL
   server takes charge of an AAA procedure for a visiting NEMO (VMNs and
   MRs).  We assume that the AAAL server also serves as the home AAA
   server for an AR by keeping a long-term key.  The trust relationship
   between the AAAH server of the MR and the AAAL server of the visited
   network is maintained through the DIAMETER protocol.  When the NEMO

   changes its point of attachment, the MR needs to be authenticated and
   authorized before it accesses the same foreign network (intra-domain
   handoff) or a new foreign network (inter-domain handoff).  To
   accomplish this, the MR and AR authenticate each other through a
   mutual authentication procedure that involves both the AAAH server of
   the MR and the AAAL server of the AR.  An attendant (which is the
   same as the AAA client) is an entity that requests authentication
   procedures to the AAA system.  In Mobile IPv6 networks, ARs normally
   act as the attendants for an MN [4].  In our protocol, the AR serves
   as an attendant for the MR's authentication, while the MR serves as
   an attendant for VMN's authentication.  In the latter case, the MR
   broadcasts attendant advertisement messages and receives
   authentication request messages from VMNs within the NEMO.

   Regarding SAs, it is assumed that the MR's AAAH and the VMN's AAAH
   have a pre-established SA.  In addition, it is assumed that the MR
   and LFNs have already authenticated each other by some mechanism,
   which is out of the scope of this document.

4.  AAA Protocol

4.1  MR Authentication

4.1.1  Inter-Domain AAA Procedure

   When a NEMO enters a new foreign network domain, an inter-domain AAA
   procedure is initiated.  Since the MR does not have any SA with the
   AAAL server in the foreign network domain, it should be authenticated
   with its AAAH server located in its home network domain.  The message
   flows for the inter-domain AAA procedure are depicted in figure 2.

       Figure 2. AAA procedures of MR : inter-domain handoff.


   1) The MR sends an Attendant Solicit (AS) message to the attendant,
   i.e.  AR.

   2) As a response to the AS message, the AR sends an Attendant
   Advertisement (AA) message including an LC.  Even without the AS
   message, the AR broadcasts AA messages periodically.

   3) The MR encrypts the received LC value using the long-term SA with
   its AAAH server and makes a CR, which is used for the MR's AAAH
   server to authenticate the MR.  Then, the MR sends an AReq message
   that contains the LC and CR to the attendant.  The AReq message also
   contains the NAI for the AAAL server to identify MR's home domain and
   the RPI for the MR to protect from replay attack.

   4) When the attendant (AR) receives the AReq message, the attendant
   converts it into an AMR message, which is a new DIAMETER message.
   And then, the attendant sends the AMR message to the AAAL server in
   the foreign domain.

   5) The AAAL server detects that it cannot authenticate the MR locally
   by checking the NAI field and hence forwards the AMR message to the
   MR's AAAH.  When the AAAH server receives the AMR message, it
   decrypts the CR using the pre-established SA and compares the result
   with the LC value.  If these two values are identical, the MR is

   successfully authenticated.  Then, the AAAH server constructs key
   materials to make two dynamic keys: one is a key_local (to be
   explained later) for intra-domain AAA procedures in the foreign
   domain and the other is a key_home to make a secure bi-directional
   tunnel between the MR and the MR's HA.  For the construction of
   key_local and key_home at the MR, SP_HOME and SP_LOCAL are also
   generated.  These security parameters are encrypted using the long-
   term key between the MR and AAAH server to avoid the possibility of
   exposure to other network entities.  If there is no HA address in the
   AMR message, the AAAH server will assign an HA for the MR.

   6) The AAAH server informs the HA of the MR's NAI and SP_HOME by the
   AHR message.

   7) The HA constructs key_home by using SP_HOME and replies with an
   AHA message for confirmation.

   8) The AMA message is used for the AAAH server to notify the AAAL
   server of the AAA result.  When the AAAL server receives the AMA
   message with authentication approval, the AAAL server decrypts the
   message using the long-term key with the AAAH server, records the
   MR's NAI, and constructs key_local.

   9) The AAAL server will relay the same AMA message from the AAAH
   server except for the SP_LOCAL to the attendant.

   10) When receiving the AMA message, the attendant learns that the MR
   is authenticated and grants the MR's network access.  In addition,
   the attendant informs the MR of the result by the ARep message
   containing SP_HOME, SP_LOCAL, home agent address, etc.

4.1.2  Intra-Domain AAA Procedure

   While a NEMO changes its point of attachment within the same foreign
   domain, we propose that the MR be authenticated through a localized
   AAA procedure with the AAAL server in the foreign network without any
   interaction with the MR's AAAH server.  That is, the AAAL of the
   foreign network can authenticate the MR by the key_local.

       Figure 3. AAA procedures of an MR : intra-domain handoff.


   Figure 3 illustrates the intra-domain AAA procedure.  As a response
   to the AA message, the VMN sends the AReq message containing CR_L,
   which is different from CR used in the inter-domain AAA procedure.
   CR_L is an authentication code generated from the key_local.  The
   attendant constructs an AMLR DIAMETER message and sends it to the
   AAAL server.  When the AAAL server receives the AMLR message, the
   AAAL server authenticates the MR by using key_local that is already
   stored at the AAAL server and informs the attendant of the result by
   the AMLA message.  Then, the attendant will relay the result by the
   ARep message.

4.2  VMN Authentication

   A VMN is a visiting MN that accesses the Internet through an MR in a
   NEMO.  According to the NEMO basic support protocol [2], the VMN does
   not need to know whether its new router is the AR or the MR.
   Therefore, the AAA scheme for VMNs should be also transparent to this
   issue.  In our AAA protocol, the MR serves as an attendant for VMNs
   and the MR's AAAH server serves as an AAAL server.  Accordingly, the
   VMN will deem the MR to be in the MR's home network.

       Figure 4. Authentication of a VMN

   Figure 4 illustrates message flows for the AAA procedure when a VMN
   is attached to a NEMO.  As mentioned above, the MR acts as an
   attendant.  Hence, the MR broadcasts AA messages periodically or
   responds to an AS message from the VMN with an AS message.  The VMN
   creates CR using the shared SA with its AAAH server VMN and sends an
   AReq message to the MR.  Then, the MR converts the AReq message into
   a DIAMETER message, AMR, and sends it to the MR's AAAH server AAAH_MR
   through a secured bi-directional tunnel.  When AAAH_MR receives the
   AMR message, it relays the AMR message to AAAH_VMN that has a shared
   SA and requests the AAA procedure for the VMN .  The AAAH_VMN
   authenticates the VMN.  During this steps, the key_home, key_local,
   SP_HOME, and SP_LOCAL are created similarly to the inter-domain AAA
   procedure of the MR.

   While a NEMO is roaming in a foreign network, VMNs within the NEMO do
   not need to know that the NEMO changes its point of attachment.
   Thus, VMNs do not have to register their locations to their HAs when
   the NEMO hands off.  This mobility transparency is the key advantage
   of the NEMO basic support protocol [2].  While keeping the mobility
   transparency, the AAAL server of the foreign network cannot detect
   the existence of VMNs.  Even if the mobility transparency is
   beneficial since it reduces the registration traffic, it makes it

   hard for the AAAL server to account the network usages of VMNs.  We
   propose that the AAAL server in the foreign domain be able to account
   the total network usage of the NEMO (not individual VMNs) and then
   this collective accounting information is sent to the MR's AAAH
   server.  Also, the MR's AAAH server maintains the accounting
   information for the MR as well as individual VMNs.  In NEMO basic
   support [2], all packets destined to MNNs are tunneled at the MR's
   HA, so that the MR's HA can keep track of individual LFNs and VMNs.
   We assume that the MR's HA will report this information to the AAAH
   server.  Consequently, the MR's AAAH server can differentiate the
   accounting information for MRs and VMNs.  In addition, we assume that
   the MR's AAAH server and the VMN's AAAH server have a trust
   relationship and a shared SA.  Therefore, the accounting information
   collected at the MR's AAAH server is securely transferred to the
   VMN's AAAH server.

   The mobility transparency causes another problem, which is how to
   authorize VMNs to use the NEMO's network service when the NEMO moves
   to a foreign domain that has a different billing policy.  To solve
   this problem, an MR sends an AA message requesting re-authentication
   of VMNs.  From the AA message, the VMN determines whether it performs
   a new AAA procedure or not.  In this paper, we assume that each
   network domain can have a different policy, so that the VMN performs
   an AAA procedure per inter-domain handoff.
