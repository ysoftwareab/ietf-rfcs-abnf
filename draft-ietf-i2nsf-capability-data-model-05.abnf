   o  If a network manager wants to apply security policy rules to block
      malicious users, it is a tremendous burden to apply all of the
      needed rules to NSFs one-by-one.  This problem can be resolved by
      managing the capabilities of NSFs.  If network manager wants to
      block malicious users with IPv6, the network manager sends the
      security policy rules to block the users to the Network Operator
      Mgmt System using I2NSF user (i.e., a web browser or a software).
      When the Network Operator Mgmt System receives the security policy
      rules, it automatically sends that security policy rules to
      appropriate NSFs (i.e., NSF-m in Developer's Mgmt System A and
      NSF-1 in Developer's Mgmt System B) which can support the
      capabilities (i.e., IPv6).  Therefore, an I2NSF User need not
      consider NSFs where to which NSFs the rules apply.

   o  If NSFs encounter the malicious packets, it is a tremendous burden
      for the network manager to apply the rule to block the malicious
      packets to NSFs one-by-one.  This problem can be resolved by
      managing the capabilities of NSFs.  If NSFs encounter the
      suspicious IPv4 packets, they can ask the Network Operator Mgmt
      System for information about the suspicious IPv4 packets in order
      to alter specific rules and/or configurations.  When the Network
      Operator Mgmt System receives information, it inspects the
      information about the suspiciou IPv4 packets.  If the suspicious
      packets are determined to be malicious packets, the Network
      Operator Mgmt System creates and sends the security policy rules
      blocking malicious packets to appropriate NSFs (i.e., NSF-1 in
      Developer's Mgmt System A and NSF-1 and NSF-n in Developer's Mgmt
      System B) which can support the capabilities (i.e., IPv4).
      Therefore, the new security policy rules blocking malicious
      packets can be applied to appropriate NSFs without humans
      intervention.
