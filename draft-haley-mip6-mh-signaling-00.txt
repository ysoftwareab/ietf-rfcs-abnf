1. Introduction 
    
   RFC 3775 [2] contains no provision to allow a home agent to inform a 
   mobile node, or vice-versa, that there is an event that requires its 
   attention.  For example, a home agent may wish to handoff some of its 
   mobile nodes to another home agent because it has come overloaded or 
   it is going offline. 
    
   This protocol describes a generic signaling message type that can be 
   used to send messages between home agents and mobile nodes securely. 
    
   This protocol does not describe the type of messages that might be 
   exchanged, that information should be defined in the document for the 
   specific Mobility option that will be used.

2. Mobility Header Signaling Message 
    
   The Mobility Header Signaling message is used by the home agent to 
   signal the mobile node, or vice-versa, that there is an event that 
   requires attention.  Signaling messages are sent as described in 
   Section 3. 
    
   The message described below follows the Mobility Header format 
   specified in Section 6.1 of [2]: 
    
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    | Payload Proto |  Header Len   |   MH Type     |   Reserved    | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |           Checksum            |                               | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               | 
    |                                                               | 
    .                                                               . 
    .                       Message Data                            . 
    .                                                               . 
    |                                                               | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
    
   The Signaling Message uses the MH Type value 8 (TBD).  When this 
   value is indicated in the MH Type field, the format of the Message 
   Data field in the Mobility Header is as follows: 
 
    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
                                   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
                                   |            Reserved           | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                                                               | 
   .                                                               . 
   .                        Mobility options                       . 
   .                                                               . 
   |                                                               | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
 
   Reserved 
 
     16-bit field reserved for future use.  The value MUST be 
     initialized to zero by the sender, and MUST be ignored by the 
     receiver.

   Mobility options 
    
     Variable-length field of such length that the complete Mobility 
     Header is an integer multiple of 8 octets long.  This field 
     contains zero of more TLV-encoded mobility options.  The encoding 
     and format of defined options MUST follow the format specified in 
     Section 6.2 of [2].  The receiver MUST ignore and skip any options 
     with it does not understand. 
      
     This specification does not define any options valid for the 
     Signaling message. 
    
   If no options are present in this message, no padding is necessary 
   and the Header Len field in the Mobility Header will be set to 0. 
 
 
3. Sending Signaling Messages 
    
   When sending a Signaling message, the sending node constructs the 
   packet as it would any other Mobility Header, except the MH Type 
   field MUST be set to 8 (TBD). 
    
   Signaling messages SHOULD be subject to rate limiting in the same 
   manner as is done for ICMPv6 messages [3]. 
 
 
4. Receiving Signaling Messages 
    
   Upon receiving a Signaling message, the Mobility Header MUST be 
   verified as specified in [2], specifically: 
    
        o The Checksum, MH type, Payload Proto and Header Len fields 
          MUST meet the requirements of Section 9.2 of [2]. 
         
        o The packet MUST be covered by the IPsec ESP SA in place for 
          Binding Updates and Acknowledgements (Section 5.1 of [2]). 
 
   If the packet is dropped due to the above tests, the receiving node 
   MUST follow the processing rules as Section 9.2 of [2] defines.  For 
   example, it MUST send a Binding Error message with the Status field 
   set to 2 (unrecognized MH Type value) if it does not support the 
   message type. 
 
    
5. IANA Considerations 
    
   A new Mobility Header type is required for the following new message 
   described in Section 2:

     8 Signaling message 
    
    
6. Security Considerations 
    
   As with other messages in [2], the Signaling message MUST use the 
   home agent to mobile node ESP encryption SA for confidentiality 
   protection, and MUST use the home agent to mobile node ESP 
   authentication SA for integrity protection.
