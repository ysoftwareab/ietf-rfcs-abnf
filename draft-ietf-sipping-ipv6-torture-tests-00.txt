Internet-Draft           SIP IPv6 Torture Tests            November 2006


1.  Overview

   This document is informational, and is NOT NORMATIVE on any aspect of
   SIP.

   This document contains test messages based on the current version
   (2.0) of the Session Initiation Protocol as defined in [1].

   This document is expected to be used as a companion document to the
   more general SIP torture test document [3], which does not include
   specific tests for IPv6 network identifiers.

   This document does not attempt to catalog every way to make an
   invalid message, nor does it attempt to be comprehensive in exploring
   unusual, but valid, messages.  Instead, it tries to focus on areas
   that may cause interoperability problems in IPv6 deployments.

   The messages are presented in the text using a set of markup
   conventions to avoid ambiguity and meet Internet-Draft layout
   requirements.  To resolve any remaining ambiguity, a bit-accurate
   version of each message is encapsulated in an appendix.

2.  SIP and IPv6 Network Configuration

   System-level issues like deploying a dual-stack proxy server,
   populating DNS with A and AAAA RRs, zero-configuration discovery of
   outbound proxies for IPv4 and IPv6 networks, when should a dual-stack
   proxy Record-Route itself, and media issues also play a major part in
   the transition to IPv6.  This document does not, however, address
   these issues.  Instead, a companion document [2] provides more
   guidance on these.

3.  Parser Torture Tests

   The test messages are organized into several sections.  Some stress
   only a SIP parser and others stress both the parser and the
   application above it.  Some messages are valid, and some are not.
   Each example clearly calls out what makes any invalid messages
   incorrect.

   Please refer to the ABNF in [1] on representing IPv6 addresses in
   SIP.  IPv6 addresses are delimited by a '[' and ']'.

   The appendix contains an encoded binary form of all the messages and
   the algorithm needed to decode them into files.

Internet-Draft           SIP IPv6 Torture Tests            November 2006


3.1  Valid SIP request with raw IPv6 addresses

   This REGISTER request is well-formatted per the grammar in [1].  An
   IPv6 address in presentation form appears in the Request-URI (R-URI),
   Via header, and Contact header.

   Message Details: reg-good


    REGISTER sip:[2001:db8::10] SIP/2.0
    To: sip:user@example.com
    From: sip:user@example.com;tag=81x2
    Via: SIP/2.0/UDP [2001:db8::9:1];branch=z9hG4bKas3-111
    Call-ID: SSG9559905523997077@hlau_4100
    Contact: "Caller" <sip:caller@[2001:db8::1]>
    CSeq: 98176 REGISTER
    Content-Length: 0



3.2  Which port should I knock on?

   IPv6 uses the colon to delimit octets.  This may lead to ambiguity if
   the port number on which to contact a SIP server is inadverdently
   conflated with the IPv6 address.  Consider the REGISTER request
   below.  The sender of the request intended to specify a port number
   (5070).  Unfortunately, however, since the IPv6 address in the R-URI
   is compressed, it makes it hard to tell whether the 5070 is a port
   number or the last octet in the address.

   From a pure parsing point of view, the REGISTER request is well-
   formed.  However, from a semantic point of view, it will not yield
   the desired result.  Implementations must take care to ensure that
   when a raw IPv6 address appears in a SIP URI, then any port number
   must appear outside the closing '[' of the URI.

   Message Details: reg-ambigous

3.3  Knock on this port, please

   In contrast to the example in Section 3.2, the following REGISTER
   request leaves no ambiguity whatsover on where the IPv6 address
   begins and where it ends.  This REGISTER request is well formatted
   per the grammar in [1].

3.4  SIP request with IPv6 in Via received parameter

   There currently exists an ambiguity on whether the received parameter
   of the Via header that contains an IPv6 address should have the
   delimiting '[' and ']' tokens.  The RFC3261 ABNF indicates that this
   is not the case, however it makes the implementation of the parser
   more optimized if it was to recognize the '[' token as a beginning of
   an IPv6 address.  In all the other instances where an IPv6 address is
   used in SIP, it is delimited by the '[' and ']' tokens.  Thus, for
   the sake of orthogonality as well as optimized parsing, it seems
   appropriate that the IPv6 addresses in the received parameter be
   delimited by '[' and ']'.  Some additional analysis on why the form
   that includes the delimiters is desirable is included in the
   following reference [7].

   More specifically, RFC3261 ABNF defines the via-received production
   rule as follows:

   via-received = "received" EQUAL (IPv4address / IPv6address)

   IPv6address production rule is then defined to hold an IPv6 address
   without the delimiting '[' and ']' tokens.  There is also an
   IPv6reference production rule in RFC3261 that yields the following:

   IPv6reference  =  "[" IPv6address "]"

   Thus, to allow the delimiting '[' and ']' tokens in the received

Internet-Draft           SIP IPv6 Torture Tests            November 2006


   parameter, all that would need to be done is to amend the RFC3261
   via-received production rule as follows:

   via-received = "received" EQUAL (IPv4address / IPv6reference)

   However, strong consensus has not yet emerged on this (the issue is
   documented on the SIPPING WG mailing list; see [6] for a link to the
   start of the discussion thread).  At the 18th SIPit, it was observed
   that [5]:

      Those testing IPv6 made different assumptions about enclosing
      literal v6 addresses in Vias in [].  By the end of the event, most
      implementations were  accepting either.  Its about 50/50 on what
      gets sent.

   Consequently, as it now stands, implementations must follow the
   Robustness Principle [4] and be liberal in accepting a received
   parameter with or without the delimiting '[' and ']' tokens.  When
   sending a request, implementations must not put the delimiting '['
   and ']' tokens.  The two test cases that follow, should thus be
   acceptable to any SIP implementation that supports IPv6.

3.4.1  SIP request with delimiting tokens in Via received parameter

   This REGISTER request contains an IPv6 address in the Via received
   parameter.  The IPv6 address is delimited by '[' and ']'.  Even
   though this is not a well-formatted request based on a strict
   interpretation of the grammar in [1], robust implementations should
   nonetheless be able to parse the topmost Via header.

3.8  More test cases

   TBD.  Looking for more test cases...suggestions welcome.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document presents NON NORMATIVE examples of SIP session
   establishment.  The security considerations in [1] apply.

   Parsers must carefully consider edge conditions and malicious input
   as part of their design.  Attacks on many Internet systems use
   crafted input to cause implementations to behave in undesirable ways.
   Many of the messages in this draft are designed to stress a parser
   implementation at points traditionally used for such attacks.  This
   document does not, however, attempt to be comprehensive.  It contains
   some common pitfalls that the authors have discovered while parsing
   IPv6 identifiers in SIP implementations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

6.  Acknowledgments

   The authors acknowledge Jeroen van Bemmel, Dennis Bijwaard, Gonzalo
   Camarillo, Bob Gilligan, Larry Kollasch, Erik Nordmark, Kumiko Ono
   and Pekka Pessi for input provided during the construction of the
   document and discussion of the test cases.

   The appendix contains a bit-exact archive of each message following
   the convention established by Robert Sparks.

Appendix A.  Bit-exact archive of each test message

   The following text block is an encoded, gzip compressed TAR archive
   of files that represent each of the example messages discussed in
   Section 4.

   To recover the compressed archive file intact, the text of this
   document may be passed as input to the following Perl script (the
   output should be redirected to a file or piped to "tar -xzvf -").


   #!/usr/bin/perl
   use strict;
   my $bdata = "";
   use MIME::Base64;
   while(<>) {
     if (/-- BEGIN MESSAGE ARCHIVE --/ .. /-- END MESSAGE ARCHIVE --/) {
           if ( m/^\s*[^\s]+\s*$/) {
               $bdata = $bdata . $_;
           }
      }
   }
   print decode_base64($bdata);


   Alternatively, the base-64 encoded block can be edited by hand to
