1.  Overview and Use Cases

   Network slicing means that a communication network is divided into
   multiple, logical end-to-end networks (slices), all sharing the same
   physical network infrastructure [_3GPP.23.501].  Multiple services
   belonging to different service categories such as eMBB, massive IoT,
   mission-critical IoT can be supported by different slices.  Network
   slicing does not remain multiple services support with virtualization
   effect but the potential is with beyond regional domain boundary for
   global vertical industry service.

   A vertical industry service may remain in a single operator domain or
   require multiple domains operated by the same network/service
   providers.  In the multiple domain scenario, network slices created
   from each domain should be federated and associated.  We call it
   'slice stitching'.  In the design phase, slice stitching can be
   treated and handled by network slice description that defines overall
   characteristics of the network slice with types of service function,
   link connectivity between network functions, resource of each service
   function and link, etc.

   The need of slice stitching could be found in load balancing,
   differentiated WAN services with more bandwidth and advanced
   middlebox support, security-enhanced purpose on demand, which can be
   provided by dynamic instantiation of a new slice and interconnection
   among the existing ones.  In addition, one very interesting use case
   can be found in providing virtualized home domain service support
   with low latency in a visited roaming domian.  The dynamic slice
   stitching can be illustrated and explained by high-level operations
   in Figs. 1 and 2. (a), (b), (c) in Figs. 1 and 2 denote the order of
   the operations in each figure.

    Figure 1: High-Level Operation Scenario of Dynamic Slice Stitching
                          for New Slice Stitching

   Fig. 1 describes an operation operation for new slice stitching.  In
   Fig. 1 (a), Slices A and B are connected, where each slice is
   instantiated at different domains operated by the same operator.  In
   Fig. 1 (b), Slice C is created and instantiated for differentiated
   WAN service support with high availability and reliability by
   following one of the needs explained above.  One thing to notice here
   is, Slice C is not connected with Slice A and Slice B.  In Fig. 1
   (c), Slice C is interconnected with Slices A and B, so a tenant with
   premium connection demand/subscription can be served by Slices A, C,
   B, while Slice A and Slice B serve on-going service sessions.

   operator.  In Fig. 2 (b), Slice B' is created for security-enhanced
   support by following one of the needs explained above.  One thing to
   notice here is, Slices A and C are not interconnected each other.  In
   Fig. 2 (c), Slice B' is federated with Slices A and C, so a tenant
   with premium connection demand/subscription can be served by Slices
   A, B', C.

   This document describes requirements for dynamic slice stitching
   explained in Figs. 1 and 2.  From the requirements, we check current
   available approaches and measures.

2.  Requirements for Dynamic Slice Stitching

   Dynamic slice stitching basically requires interconnection between
   Slice A and B(B'), Slice B(B') and C.  The interconnection should be
   made at network resource level to meet required connectivity demand
   in the end-to-end connection perspective.  The interconnection also
   includes function level, so chaining of service functions between
   Slice A and B(B'), Slice B(B') and C should dynamically be made.

   1) Resource stitching between slices

   Suppose that Slice A and Slice B in Fig. 1 were configured with 100
   Mbps bandwidth and 100 ms latency in end-to-end connection.  When
   Slice C is interconnected with Slice A and Slice B, to meet the same
   or better performance for service sessions going through Slice A,
   Slice C, Slice B in order, dynamic adjustment such as scaling up/down
   of existing resouce assigned in Slice A to Slice B could be required.
   The resource adjustment and reconfiguration may also happen in Fig.
   2.

   2) Service function stitching between slices

   Suppose that each slice is composed of one or more service functions
   and the service functions in each slice need to be stitched for end-
   to-end service.  Service functions should dynamically chained.  When
   it comes Service Function Chaining (SFC) with the Network Service
   Header (NSH) approach or routing controller, dynamic calculation of
   chaining should be orchestrated by the multi-domain slice
   orchestrator and configuration should be made at proper entity such
   as NSH classifier or dataplane node.  However, such approach may
   bring about chaining scalability issue with chaining burden.
   Isolating SF chaining list per slice with such as hierarchical SFC
   (hSFC) could be effective and efficient for smooth operation support
   in the function stitching [I-D.ietf-sfc-hierarchical].
