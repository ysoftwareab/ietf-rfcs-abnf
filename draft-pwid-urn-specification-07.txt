            A Persistent Web IDentifier (PWID) URN Namespace
                    draft-pwid-urn-specification-07

Abstract

   This document specifies a Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Persistent
   Web IDentifiers for web material in web archives using the 'pwid'
   namespace identifier.

   The main purpose of the standard is to support specification of
   references that are not covered by other reference techniques: to
   support references to material in web archives with restricted
   access.  Furthermore, it supports persistent technology agnostic
   references to web archives in general, in a form that can work as an
   algorithmic basis for finding web archive resources in general.  An
   additional important benefit is that the standard can be used for
   specifying web collections, which can then form a persistent
   computational basis for the extract of the archived collection parts.
   Since these parts can be specified generally, this further allows
   collections to be specified with elements from one or more web
   archives.

   The PWID URN is designed to meet requirements for proper referencing
   needed by researchers.  Therefore, it is designed as general, global,
   sustainable, humanly readable, technology agnostic, persistent and
   precise web references for web materials in web archives.

1.  Introduction

   The PWID URN is a supplement to existing reference standards, where
   the PWID URN will support references to web archives, including areas
   that are not supported today: support of references to material in
   web archives with restricted access.  Furthermore, the PWID URN
   enables technology agnostic references to web archives in general,
   which can be needed, for instance for references to dynamic web
   material with frequent updates (e.g. a news site) or a specific
   version of a web material (e.g. specific version of the DOI
   handbook).

   The PWID URN is in a form which can work as an algorithmic basis for
   finding the resource.  This also enables computation of archived web
   parts to a collection from one or more web archives, if the
   collection parts are specified by PWID URNs.

   Furthermore, the PWID URN includes information about the resource
   which makes it possible to find alternative resources, in cases where
   the original precise resource has become unavailable.

   The PWID URN is designed to be a persistent reference that is
   general, global and technology agnostic in order to enhance its
   chances of being sustainable.  Furthermore, it is designed to be
   humanly readable and with an ability to specify precision about what
   the referenced web archive resource covers.  This design enables a
   PWID URN to:

   o  be used in technical solutions, e.g. to make them resolvable

   o  cover references to all sorts of materials in web archives

   o  cover references to materials from all sorts of web archives

   The motivation for defining a PWID namespace is the growing
   challenges of references to archived web resources, and the PWID as a
   URN can assist in overcoming a lot of these challenges.  The standard
   is needed to address web materials meeting precision and persistency
   issues on par with precision in traditional references for analogue
   material.  Furthermore, it is needed in order to address web archive
   resources that are not freely available online.  The PWID URN covers
   both referencing of web resources from research papers and definition
   of web collections/corpora.  In detail the challenges are:

   o  Persistent Identifier systems (like DOI [DOI]) will only cover
      registered resources.  In general, citation guidelines do not
      cover general and persistent referencing techniques for web
      resources that are not registered.  However, an increasing number
      of references point to resources that only exist on the web, e.g.
      blogs that turn out to have a historical impact.  In order to
      obtain persistency for a reference, the target needs to be stable.
      For non-registered web resources, the common rule is that the
      resource will change, since the live-web is constantly changing.
      Persistency can only be obtained by referring to something stable,
      i.e. an archived snapshot of the resource from the web.  The PWID
      URN is therefore focused on referencing archived web material in a
      technology agnostic way (research documented in [IPRES2016] and
      [ResawRef]).

   o  References to materials, which only exist in web archives (i.e. no
      longer on the live web) are not well supported, especially not for
      materials that only exists in archives with restricted access.
      There are many new initiatives for web archive referencing, - most
      of which are centralized solutions offering harvesting and
      referencing, but these cannot be used for materials that only
      exist in web archives.  The PWID URN can be used for all web
      archives, including web archives with restricted access.

   o  One of the referencing initiatives for open web archives uses URLs
      which depend on the current setup of the web archive's access
      platform.  These URLs are usually technology and placement
      dependent, and therefore such a reference style is not suited for
      references that are important to retrace for a long period.  The
      PWID URN can be used for such reference purposes, since it is
      technology agnostic.

   o  Another referencing initiative, for open web archives, is omitting
      specification of the web archive where the resource was found.
      This strategy is used in order to open the possibility of using
      alternatives from other archives.  However, this also adds a risk
      of imprecision since different archives tend to have different
      versions even when harvesting at the same time.  Therefore, such a
      reference style is not suited for references where it is important
      that the reference is precisely the verified reference.  The PWID
      URN can provide an exact reference for where the reference was
      validated.  Additionally, the PWID contains the needed information
      in order to search for alternative resource, if needed.

   o  For reference of web collections/corpora (possibly across
      different web archives), recent research have found that various
      legal and sustainability issues has led to a need of a collection
      definition of references to their web parts.  Furthermore, there
      is a need for a similar persistent referencing for all parts for
      calculation and sustainability reasons.  So far, there has been no
      stable standard for definition of such collection parts.  The PWID
      URN can be used for such definitions in order to fulfil these
      requirements (research documented in [ResawColl]).

   The PWID URN is especially useful for web material where precision is
   in focus and/or there are references to materials from web archives
   requiring special permissions in order to gain access.  The precision
   regards both pointing to the archive where it was found and validated
   against its purpose (other archived versions in other web archives
   may differ both regarding completeness and contents even within short
   time periods) as well as precision in what is actually referred by
   the reference (e.g. is it the page or the whole website).

   Furthermore, the PWID URN is very useful in specification of contents
   of a web collection.  Definitions of web collections are often needed
   for extraction of data used in production of research results, e.g.
   for future evaluations.  Current practices are not persistent as they
   often use some CDX version, which vary for different implementations.

   Strict syntax is needed for the PWID URN, in order to ensure that it
   can act as a reference which can used for computational purposes.
   This is especially relevant for automatic extraction of parts from

   web collection definitions.  Furthermore, today's readers of research
   papers are expecting to be able to access a referenced resource by
   clicking an actionable URI, therefore a similar possibility will be
   expected for references to available archived web material, and this
   is possible with a strict syntax.  Examples of technical solutions
   that are enabled are:

   o  Resolving of a reference to a web collection and automatic
      extraction of the parts of a web collection defined by PWID URNs
      [ResawRef] [ResawColl]

   o  Resolving of a PWID URN by resolving services.  To begin with, a
      prototype has been developed for the Danish web archive data and
      open web archives with standard patterns for the current
      technologies.  Implementations for resolution of PWID URNs for
      other web archives may be developed.

   The purpose of the PWID URN is also to express a web archive
   reference as simple as possible and at the same time meet the
   requirements for sustainability, usability and scope.  Therefore, the
   PWID URN is focused on having only the minimum required information
   to make a precise identification of a resource in an arbitrary web
   archive.  Recent research have shown that this can be obtained by the
   following information [ResawRef]:

   o  Identification of web archive

   o  Identification of source:

      *  Archived URI or identifier

      *  Archival timestamp

   o  Intended precision (page, part, subsite etc.)

   The PWID URN represents this information in a human readable way as
   well as a well-defined way that enables technical solutions to
   interpret the URN.

      *  'archive-id' must either be the domain for the archive which
         can lead to descriptions of how to access (or apply for access)
         materials in he archive, - or it must be a registered archive-
         id (registry still to be defined and created).  Distinction
         between the to types of identifiers is made by matching the
         first character with "~".  In case of a match, it means that
         the rest of the identifier is a registered archive item
         identifiers, since the syntax requires such identifiers to be
         prefixed with "~", while no URI is allowed to start with this
         character

      *  'archival-time' is a UTC timestamp which conforms to the W3C
         profile of [ISO8601] [W3CDTF] and a subset of date-time
         specified in [RFC3339] (except from allowing partial time
         specification).  The archival-time may be specified at any of
         the levels of granularity, as long as it reflects exactly the
         granularity of the timestamp recorded in the archive (which is
         in accordance with the WARC standard [ISO28500]).

      *  'archive-item-id' must either be the archived URI for the
         source or a registered archive-item-id.  Distinction between
         the to types of identifiers is made by matching the first
         character with "~".  In case of a match, it means that the rest
         of the identifier is a registered archive item identifiers,
         since the syntax requires such identifiers to be prefixed with
         "~", while no URI is allowed to start with this character

      The precision specification is expressing the intended precision
      of the reference, which is needed for specification of

      *  precise coverage of the reference
         e.g. to an html file, since the precise meaning of what the
         reference covers can be very varied (the html file itself?, the
         web page it renders to? a subsite that it represents? etc.) or
         a collection of web parts with precise sepcification of which
         web parts that are included.

      *  degree of how precise the reference is with respect to what can
         be viewed in the future
         the html file itself will probably be the same and a collection
         specification is also quite precise (see also example of a
         collection is provided in the section about assignment).
         However, for web pages and websites there are interpretation

         involved, which mean the result of rendering them in the web
         archive can change over time.  This may happen in case the web
         archive's algorithm for calculation of the referred web parts
         or additional parts have been added which will be picked by the
         algorithm.

      *  how resolvers should display the referred source in order to
         correspond to the precision specification
         if it is an html file it can e.g. be as a text file if the
         preceision specification is 'part', via Wayback if the
         preceision specification is "webpage", choosing a snapshot
         version of the page if the the preceision specification is
         'snapshot' etc.  If access is limited to the referenced part
         (the html page), then the application would also need to make
         sure that all parts/pages belonging to the site/subsite is
         available.


      The following valid precision-spec values are exists:

      *  'part'
         Meaning the single archived file/web part harvested as from the
         specified URI.  In case the URI is for a file for a web page.
         For refences to web pages with html code (e.g. html or asp
         file) this will mean the actual file with the html code.  It is
         relevant to refer to web pages this way, in case it is part of
         a collection specification or in case it is the html that is of
         interest (e.g. javascripts or hidden links which are not
         visible when rendering the web page).
         For all other types of files the URI will be for single files
         to be interpreted a file.  The precision-spec will always be
         'part' for such single non-web related files.

      *  'page'
         Meaning that an application like Wayback calculates a resulting
         web page based on calculated referenced web parts (display
         templates, images etc.).  For example an html page displaying
         an image will need both the html and the referred image.  If it
         is important for the reference to be sure that it is the same
         image, the most a precise reference to a picture in context of
         a web page would be to provide the PWID URN for the page (with
         webpage precision) and the PWID URN for the image file part
         which contains the referred picture (with part precision)

      *  'subsite'
         Meaning the subsite defined by the referred web page (as
         described under 'page') and underlying web pages (referred by
         the page) that have URIs starting with the same path as the

         archived URI.  Calculatiuon of all the relevant parts for the
         subsite are calculated by an application like Wayback
         (similarly to what is described under 'page').

      *  'site'
         Meaning the site defined by the referred web page (as described
         under 'page') and underlying web pages (referred by the page)
         that have URIs starting with the same path as the archived URI.
         Calculatiuon of all the relevant parts for the site are
         calculated by an application like Wayback (similarly to what is
         described under 'page').

      *  'collection'
         Meaning the collection which is defined in a specification
         which can be identified by an identifier (e.g. collection
         specification in the XML format enabling interpretation as in
         the example provided in [ResawColl])

      *  'snapshot'
         Meaning a snapshot (image) representation of web material, e.g.
         a web page

      *  'recording'
         Meaning a representation of a web recording specification where
         the web archive applications will decide how it is rendered
         (interpretation could e.g. depend on file-suffix for the web
         recording), an example is a web recording coded in a WARC file

      The option of making an extension value is included to allow
      reference of a resource of any kind with an assigned identifier,
      even if it is not covered by the other values.  In all cases, it
      will be up to the application serving the web archive to interpret
      how this item should be rendered.

   Assignment:

      The PWID URNs do not have to be assigned by an authority, as they
      are based on the information created at the time of archiving.  In
      other words: a PWID URN is created independently, but following an
      algorithm which ensures that the referred item can be found if it
      is still available.  A PWID URN also has the benefit that it
      includes information to look at alternative resources e.g. via
      Memento for some open web archives [MEMENTO] or via possible
      future web archive infrastructures.

      A PWID URN is created by finding the relevant information of the
      syntax parts of the PWID:

        "urn:pwid:" archive-id ":" archival-time ":" precision-spec
                               ":" archived-item-id

      The PWID URN for an archived item at hand can be constructed by
      exchanging the unspecified PWID parts with relevant information,
      as explained in the following:

      *  archive-id (identification of web archive):
         In this version of the standard, it is recommended to use the
         domain of the web archive as the identifier for the web archive
         (e.g. archive.org for Internet Archive's open web archive and
         netarkivet.dk for the Danish web archive with restricted
         access).  This is recommended, since browsing the domain page
         will typically lead to a description of how to access the web
         archive, e.g. by online access or by applying for access
         grants.  Furthermore, it is more precise than e.g.  the name of
         the archive, since there may be more than one installation of
         web archives at the same organization, e.g.  archive.org and
         archive-it.org are both covered by Internet Archive.
         When a registry of web archives is established, it will be more
         precise and persistent to use the web archive identifier
         specified in this registry.  (e.g.  DKWA for the Danish web
         archive with the domain netarkivet.dk).  The syntax requires
         that such identifiers are prefixed with the character "~".

      *  archival-time (archival timestamp):
         The archival time for the archived item must be specified with
         as much granularity as possible in order to make sure it
         uniquely identifies the resource at hand.  The archival time
         may be displayed along with the archived item, but there are
         different implementations where it is important to be aware of
         whether a more precise timestamp can be found, and whether the
         correct timestamp is used.  In many Wayback implementations,
         the precise timestamp can be found as part of the URI used for
         viewing the archived item.  For example, the archive http URI
         https://web.archive.org/web/20160122112029/http://www.dr.dk for
         an archived resource viewable via the Internet Archive's
         Wayback installation, the number 20160122112029 represents the
         archival time 2016-01-22T11:20:29Z.  In other installations,
         the most precise timestamp may be found in the URI from a
         search result leading to the resource (which usually redirects
         on basis of a call to the underlying archive index).
         Especially for web pages with frames, there may be cases where
         the actual time is not displayed with the source, since only
         the times for the contents of the frames are displayed.

      *  precision-spec (precision as represented page, part, site,
         snapshot etc.):

         The precision specification specifies how the user should view
         the referred item - either as a specific representation (with
         inherited precision) or by use of tools (e.g. browse web site
         based on calculations or browse on basis of collection of
         specific parts).
         Inherited precision is implicitly indicated by the precision
         specification from how the information is used in resolution
         and location.  The most precis reference is part, e.g. for an
         image which can be located and accessed independently.  Less
         precise references are references where calculation of other
         parts are needed in order to resolve and view it, e.g. page,
         site or subsite.

      *  archived-item-id (archived URI or registered identifier):
         The archived item identifier will either be the archived URI of
         the displayed archived item at hand, or it will be an
         identifier assigned for a resource by the archive.  In the
         latter case, the syntax requires that such identifiers are
         prefixed with the character "~".

      A much easier way to construct PWID URNs is to use tools that
      construct them.  Currently, there is also a prototype for a SOLR-
      Wayback tool (Source at https://github.com/netarchivesuite/
      solrwayback) [PWIDprovider], which can assist in finding the most
      precise reference to an archived web page.  This Wayback version
      can provide all PWID URNs belonging to a shown page (with the page
      PWID URN at the top).  For example, in netarkivet.dk, the archived
      URI for the web page http://www.susanlegetoej.dk/shop/handskedyr-
      siameser-killing-8681p.html archived 2008-11-29 01:19:16 UTC, has
      the following parts calculated by the SOLR-Wayback tool:

   Security and Privacy:

      Security and privacy considerations are restricted to accessible
      web resources in web archives.  Resolvers to PWID URNs will
      usually only be possible using the web archives' access tools,
      where security and privacy are covered by these tools.  In such
      cases security and privacy will be as covered by these tools.  It
      should be noted that an archived web page or part can be just as
      dangerous as a "live" page or part; for instance, it could include
      insecure scripts, malware, trackers, etc.  Furthermore, an
      archived page can in fact be more dangerous, because it could
      include outdated scripts with known vulnerabilities that can never
      be patched because the script is archived for all time in a
      vulnerable state.

   Interoperability:

      This is covered by comments in the Syntax description:

      *  the PWID URN conforms to the URI standard defined as in
         [RFC3986] and the URN standard [RFC8141]

      *  the 'archival-time' of the PWID URN conforms to the UTC
         timestamp as described in the W3C profile of ISO 8601 [ISO8601]
         [W3CDTF] and is in accordance with the WARC standard ISO 28500
         [ISO28500].

      *  for use of URIs for the 'archived-item-id', this URI conforms
         to the URI standard defined as in [RFC3986], with %-encodings
         of "[", "]", "#", "?" and "%" in order to conform to the URN
         standard [RFC8141] as well as having unambiguous use of "%"

   Resolution:

      The information in a PWID URN can be used for locating a web
      archive resource, for any kind of web archive.  It includes the
      minimum information for web archive materials, which enables
      resolvability, manually or by a resolver.  Resolution of a PWID
      URN is the primary motivation of making a formal URN definition,
      instead of just textual representation of the for needed parts of
      a PWID.

      Resolution (manually or automatically) is done based on the PWID
      parts:

      *  Web archive identification for web archive holding referred
         resource

Internet-DraAtPersistent Web IDentifier (PWID) URN Namespace    May 2019


         If the identifier do not start with "~", then the identifier is
         the domain name for the web archive, where browsing this domain
         page typically will lead to description of how to access the
         web archive.  For example, "archive.org" is the domain name
         leading to the Internet Archive's interface to their online web
         collection, and "netarkivet.dk" is the domain name leading to
         the website for the Danish web archive with information about
         how to apply for access permission to the web collections.  If
         the identifier starts with "~" the archive can be identified by
         looking up the identifier (from the rest of the archive
         identier) in a registry of archives.  It is a future
         possibility is to have such a registry which should have
         archive identifiers along with their current location on the
         internet.  Such a registry will be needed for persistent
         reference to the archive, since an archive may change their
         location and name or archives may merge.  There is work in
         progress to define such a registry, but no details yet.

      *  Archived URI or registered identifier of archived item
         If the identifier do not start with "~", then the resource is
         an archived URI, this URI must be used in search for or
         construction of location of the resource.  If the identifier
         starts with "~", then the rest of the characters in the
         identifier constitutes a registered identifier assigned to the
         resource (by the archive), it is then this identifier that must
         be used in search for or construction of location of the
         resource

      *  Date and time associated with the archived item
         The archival date and time must be used in search for or
         construction of the location of the resource

      *  Precision of what is referred
         The precision can either contribute to the guidance of
         activating tools to view the referred item e.g. browse the
         referred item as a page on basis of computed closest past,
         browse the referred item on basis of parts specified in a
         collection, or view the referred item as a snapshot.  In the
         example of the snapshot, it also contains a specification of
         which resource to display

      In the following the different resolution techniques are explained
      (manual as well as via a service) .

      An example of a PWID URN is:

      Resolution of this URN PWID can be deduced based on the current
      (2019) knowledge of Internet Archive's open Wayback access web
      interface, which has the pattern:

         https://web.archive.org/web/<time>/<uri>

      Using this pattern (where only digits from the timestamp is
      included) it is possible manually (or automatically) to deduce the
      online https URI:

         https://web.archive.org/web/20160122112029/http://www.dr.dk

      The same recipe can be used for other Wayback platforms for open
      web archives.

      Another manual resolution is to find the resource by use of the
      specified web archive's search interface.  This will work for both
      open web archives and web archives with restricted access onsite.

      It is also noteworthy that the information in the PWID can help in
      finding an alternative resource, in case the original referred
      resource is no longer available.  The archived URI can be searched
      in other web archives, where the date and time can help to find
      the best match, e.g. via Memento (for some open web archives) or
      via possible coming web archive infrastructures.

      If an open web archive has registered an identifier for the web
      archive along with the current pattern for access with <time> and
      <uri> - and where the latter information is updated when the
      pattern change - then such a register can be used to deduce
      location on long term.  Likewise, for web archives with restricted
      access, the registry will be able to provide information of where
      to apply for access permissions.

      Regarding the precision specification, there are so far no
      implementations which support distinctive rendering depending on
      such a parameter, e.g. only providing html for an html page
      specified as part and the page with calculated elements if
      specified as page etc.  Therefore, the precision specification
      will initially be ignored by a resolution to a Wayback interface.

      A resolving service is currently available in form of code for a
      prototype which run at the Royal Danish Library [PWIDresolver] and
      is planned to be more widely available.  This service currently
      covers both the Danish web archive (with the proper rights) and
      open web archives with access services based on a pattern
      including archive, archival time and archived URI.  In other
      words, for open web archives it covers conversion of PWID URNs
      for: archive.org, archive-it.org, arquivo.pt, bibalex.org,
      nationalarchives.gov.uk, stanford.edu and vefsafn.is.  For the
      Danish web archive with restricted access, the prototype works
      locally accessing the CDX of the library, and providing access via
      a local proxy to a restricted environment.  The source code for
      this prototype is available from
      https://github.com/netarchivesuite/NAS-research/releases/
      tag/0.0.6.

      Automatic access of a referenced web resource may work on the open
      web for open web archives or in restricted environments for the
      web archives with restricted access.  There may be a need for
      varied operation depending on the available technology and
      applications, e.g.:

      *  Via locally installed browser plug-ins or applications forming
         http/https URIs as described above

      *  Via web research infrastructures
         This is a future solution scenario as a web archive research
         infrastructure does not yet exist.  However, it is a likely
         future scenario, as it is currently being proposed in the RESAW
         community [RESAW]

   Additional Information:

      The PWID was originally suggested as a URI, based on research
      between a computer science researcher with knowledge of web
      archiving and researchers from humanity subjects (History and
      Literature).  This resulted in the paper "Persistent Web
      References - Best Practices and New Suggestions" [IPRES2016] from
      the iPres 2016 conference.  In this paper, the PWID is referred to
      as WPID.  However, feedback was received displaying a concern that
      WPID was interpreted as a PID related to a PID-system, e.g. as the
      DOI.  Although the definition of a PID does not contradict the
      name "WPID", there would still be a danger of confusing it with
      PID-systems, which is not the intension.  Consequently, this
      suggestion names the PWID instead.

      Comments on the drafted PWID URI ([DraftPwidUri]) have suggested
      that it should be a URN rather than a URI, which is why the PWID
      URN is defined here.

      At the RESAW 2017 conference there were two related papers: One on
      referencing practices [ResawRef] and one on research data
      management practices [ResawColl].  These practices are also
      planned to be used for Danish web collections.

      There has been expressed interest for the PWID URN at several
      occasions.  There were lots of response at iPRES 2016.  Especially
      at the RESAW 2017 conference, web researchers from digital
      humanities have expressed a strong interest in the PWID, since it
      will fill a gap and make it possible for the researchers to make
      the necessary references.

      At iPRES 2018, the PWID URN was presented as a digital poster,
      which gained a lot of interest and won the "Best poster" award
      [IPRES2018].

      A more researcher-oriented poster was presented at iDCC 2019
      [IDCC2019].

   Revision Information:

      This is the first version of PWID as a URN.
