Abstract

  Collective attributes allow common characteristics to be shared
  between collections of entries.  This document summarizes the X.500
  information model for collective attributes and describes use of
  collective attributes in LDAP.  This document provides LDAP schema
  descriptions for X.500 collective attributes.

Conventions

  Schema definitions are provided using LDAPv3 description formats
  [RFC2252].

  The key words ``MUST'', ``MUST NOT'', ``REQUIRED'', ``SHALL'', ``SHALL
  NOT'', ``SHOULD'', ``SHOULD NOT'', ``RECOMMENDED'',  and ``MAY'' in
  this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
  [RFC2119].


1. Introduction

  A collective attribute is "a user attribute whose values are the same
  for each member of an entry collection" [X.501].


1.1. Entry Collections

  A collection of entries is a grouping of object and alias entries
  based upon common properties or shared relationship between the
  corresponding entries which share certain attributes.  An entry
  collection consists of all entries within scope of a collective
  attributes subentry.  An entry may belong to several entry
  collections.


1.2. Collective Attributes

  Attributes shared by the entries comprising an entry collection are
  called collective attributes.  Values of collective attributes are
  visible but not updateable to clients accessing entries within the
  collection.  Collective attributes are updated (i.e. modified) via
  their associated collective attributes subentry.

  When an entry belongs to multiple entry collections, the entry's
  values of each collective attribute are combined such that independent
  sources of these values are not manifested to clients.

  Entries may specifically exclude a particular collective attribute by
  listing the attribute as a value of the collectiveExclusions
  attribute.  Like user attributes, collective attributes are subject to
  a variety of controls including access, administrative, and content
  controls.


2. System Schema for Collective Attributes

  The following operational attributes are used manage Collective
  Attributes.  LDAP servers MUST act in accordance with the X.500
  Directory Models [X.501] when providing this service.


2.1. collectiveAttributes

  Subentries of this object class are used to administer collective
  attributes and are referred to as collective attribute subentries.

      ( 2.5.20.2 NAME 'collectiveAttributes' AUXILIARY )

  A collective attribute subentry SHOULD contain at least one collective
  attribute.  The collective attributes contained within a collective
  attribute subentry are available for finding, searching, and
  comparison at every entry within the scope of the subentry. The
  collective attributes, however, are administered (e.g. modified) via
  the subentry.


2.2. collectiveAttributeSubentry

  The collectiveAttributeSubentry operational attribute identifies all
  collective attribute subentries that affect the entry.  It is
  available in every entry and MAY have multiple values.

      ( 2.5.18.12 NAME 'collectiveAttributeSubentry'
          EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
          SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12
          USAGE directoryOperation NO-USER-MODIFICATION )


2.3. collectiveExclusions

  The collectiveExclusions operational attribute allows particular
  collective attributes to be excluded from an entry.  It MAY appear in
  any entry and MAY have multiple values.

      ( 2.5.18.7 NAME 'collectiveExclusions'
          EQUALITY objectIdentifierMatch
          SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38
          USAGE directoryOperation )

  The name excludedAllCollectiveAttributes is associated with the OID
  2.5.18.0.  When this name or OID is present as a value of the
  collectiveExclusions attribute, to exclude all collective attributes
  from an entry.

3. Collective Attribute Types

  A userApplications attribute type may be defined to be COLLECTIVE
  [RFC2252].  This indicates that the same attribute values will appear
  in the entries of an entry collection subject to the use of the
  collectiveExclusions attribute and other administrative controls.

  Collective attribute types are commonly defined as subtypes of non-
  collective attribute types.  By convention, collective attributes are
  named by prefixing the name of their non-collective supertype with
  "collective" or "c".  For example, the collective street attribute is
  named cTelephoneNumber after its non-collective supertype
  telephoneNumber.

  Non-collective attributes types SHALL NOT subtype collective
  attributes.  Collective attributes SHALL NOT be SINGLE-VALUED.
  Operational attributes SHALL NOT be defined to be collective.

  Collective attribute types SHALL NOT appear in the attribute types of
  an object class definition.

  The remainder of section provides a summary of collective attributes
  derived from those defined in X.520 [X.520].  Implementations of this
  specification SHOULD support the following collective attributes and
  MAY support additional collective attributes.


3.1. Collective Locality Name

  The cL attribute type specifies a locality name for a collection of
  entries.

      ( 2.5.4.7.1 NAME 'cL'

3.2. Collective State or Province Name

  The cSt attribute type specifies a state or province name for a
  collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.8.1 NAME 'cSt'
          SUP st COLLECTIVE )


3.3. Collective Street Address

  The cStreet attribute type specifies a street address for a collection
