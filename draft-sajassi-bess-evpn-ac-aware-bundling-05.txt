              AC-Aware Bundling Service Interface in EVPN
              draft-sajassi-bess-evpn-ac-aware-bundling-05

Abstract

   EVPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution
   over an MPLS/IP network for intra-subnet connectivity among Tenant
   Systems and End Devices that can be physical or virtual.

   EVPN multihoming with IRB is one of the common deployment scenarios.
   There are deployments which requires capability to have multiple
   subnets designated with multiple VLAN IDs in single Broadcast Domain.

   EVPN technology defines three different types of service interface
   which serve different requirements but none of them address the
   requirement of supporting multiple subnets within single Broadcast
   Domain.  In this draft we define new service interface type to
   support multiple subnets in single Broadcast Domain.  Service
   interface proposed in this draft will be applicable to multihoming
   case only.

1.  Introduction

   EVPN based All-Active multi-homing is becoming the basic building
   block for providing redundancy in next generation data center
   deployments as well as service provider access/aggregation network.
   For EVPN IRB mode, there are deployments which expect to be able to
   support multiple subnets within single Broadcast Domain.  Each subnet
   would be differentiated by VLAN.  Thus, single IRB interface can
   still serve multiple subnet.

   Motivation behind such deployments are

   1.  Manageability: The support to have multiple subnets using single
       Broadcast Domain requires only one Broadcast Domain and one IRB
       for "N" subnets compare to "N" Broadcast Domain and "N" IRB
       interface to manage.

   2.  Simplicity: It avoids extra configuration by configuring VLAN
       Range with single BD and IRB as compare to individual VLAN, BD
       and IRB interface per subnet.

   [RFC7432] defines three types of service interface.  None of them
   provide flexibility to achieve multiple subnets within single
   Broadcast Domain.  The different types of service interface from
   [RFC7432] are:

   1.  VLAN-Based Service Interface: With this service interface, an
       EVPN instance consists of only a single broadcast domain (e.g., a
       single VLAN).  Therefore, there is a one-to-one mapping between a
       VID on this interface and a MAC-VRF.

   2.  VLAN Bundle Service Interface: With this service interface, an
       EVPN instance corresponds to multiple broadcast domains (e.g.,
       multiple VLANs); however, only a single bridge table is
       maintained per MAC-VRF, which means multiple VLANs share the same
       bridge table.  The MPLS-encapsulated frames MUST remain tagged
       with the originating VID.  Tag translation is NOT permitted.  The
       Ethernet Tag ID in all EVPN routes MUST be set to 0.

   3.  VLAN-Aware Bundle Service Interface: With this service interface,
       an EVPN instance consists of multiple broadcast domains (e.g.,
       multiple VLANs) with each VLAN having its own bridge table --
       i.e., multiple bridge tables (one per VLAN) are maintained by a
       single MAC-VRF corresponding to the EVPN instance.

   From definition, it seems like VLAN Bundle Service Interface does
   provide flexibility to support multiple subnets within single
   Broadcast Domain.  However, the requirement is to have multiple
   subnets from same ES on multi-homing all active mode; that would not
   work.  For example, lets take the case from Figure 1 where PE1 learns
   MAC of H1 on VLAN 1 (subnet S1).  PE1 originates EVPN MAC route, as
   per [RFC7432], where the Ethernet Tag would be set to 0.  Incoming
   packets from IRB interface, at PE2, are untagged packet.  PE2 does
   not have any associated AC information from EVPN MAC routes
   advertised by PE1.  PE2 can not forward traffic which is destined to
   H1.

   This draft proposes an extension to existing service interface types
   defined in [RFC7432] and defines AC-aware Bundling service interface.
   AC-aware Bundling service interface would provide mechanism to have
   multiple subnets in single Broadcast Domain.  This extension is
   applicable only for multi-homed EVPN peers.

1.1.  Problem With Unicast MAC Route

   BD-1 has multiple subnets where each subnet is distinguished by VLAN
   1, 2 ,3 and 4.  PE1 learns MAC address MAC-1 from AC associated with
   subnet S1.  PE1 uses MAC route to advertise MAC-1 presence to peer
   PEs.  As per [RFC7432] MAC route advertisement from PE1 does not
   carry any context providing information about MAC address association
   with AC.  When PE2 receives MAC route with MAC-2 it can not determine
   which AC this MAC belongs too.

   Since PE2 could not bind MAC-1 with correct AC, when it receives data
   traffic destined to MAC-1, it does not know the destination AC since
   multiple bridge ports have the same ESI assignment.

1.2.  Problem With Multicast Route Synchronization

   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-igmp-mld-proxy] defines mechanism to synchronize
   multicast routes between multihome peers.  In above case, if receiver
   behind S1 send IGMP membership request, CE could hash it to either of
   the PEs.  When multicast route is originated, it does not contain any
   AC information.  Once it reaches to peering PE, it does not have any
   information about which subnet this IGMP membership request belong
   to.  Similarly to unicast traffic problem, the incoming multicast
   traffic from IRB cannot be forearded to proper AC.

1.3.  Potential Security Concern caused By Misconfiguration

   In case of single subnet per Broadcast Domain, there is potential
   case of security issue.  For example, PE1 has BD1 configured with
   VLAN-1 where as multihome peer PE2 has BD1 configured VLAN-2.  Each
   of the IGMP membership requests on PE1 would be synchronized to PE2
   and PE2 would process multicast routes and start forwarding multicast
   traffic on VLAN-2, which was not intended.  Again, similar issue can
   potentially be seen with unicast traffic.

2.  Terminology

   *  AC: Attachment Circuit.

   *  ARP: Address Resolution Protocol.

   *  BD: Broadcast Domain.  As per [RFC7432], an EVI consists of a
      single or multiple BDs.  In case of VLAN-bundle and VLAN-based
      service models (see [RFC7432]), a BD is equivalent to an EVI.  In
      case of VLAN-aware bundle service model, an EVI contains multiple
      BDs.  Also, in this document, BD and subnet are equivalent terms.

Internet-Draft  AC-Aware Bundling Service Interface in E   February 2022


   *  BD Route Target: refers to the Broadcast Domain assigned Route
      Target [RFC4364].  In case of VLAN-aware bundle service model, all
      the BD instances in the MAC-VRF share the same Route Target.

   *  BT: Bridge Table.  The instantiation of a BD in a MAC-VRF, as per
      [RFC7432].

   *  Ethernet A-D route: Ethernet Auto-Discovery (A-D) route, as per
      [RFC7432].

   *  EVI: EVPN Instance spanning the NVE/PE devices that are
      participating on that EVPN, as per [RFC7432].

   *  EVPN: Ethernet Virtual Private Networks, as per [RFC7432].

   *  IRB: Integrated Routing and Bridging interface.  It connects an
      IP-VRF to a BD (or subnet).

   *  MAC-VRF: A Virtual Routing and Forwarding table for Media Access
      Control (MAC) addresses on an NVE/PE, as per [RFC7432].  A MAC-VRF
      is also an instantiation of an EVI in an NVE/PE.

   *  ND: Neighbor Discovery Protocol.

   *  RD: BGP Route Distinguisher.

   *  RT-2: EVPN route type 2, i.e., MAC/IP advertisement route, as
      defined in [RFC7432].

   *  RT-5: EVPN route type 5, i.e., IP Prefix route.  As defined in
      Section 3 of [RFC9136].

   *  SN: Subnet.

   *  TS: Tenant System.

   *  VLAN: The usage of VLAN refers to 802.1Q or 802.1AD tag.

   *  (S,G): Multicast membership request

   *  This document also assumes familiarity with the terminology of
      [RFC7432],[RFC8365], [RFC7365].

3.  Requirements

   1.  A service interface represents an attachement-circuit where
       multiple VLAN are configured on.  Each of these VLANs are
       represented by a different AC under a single Broadcast Domain.

Internet-Draft  AC-Aware Bundling Service Interface in E   February 2022


   2.  Single Broadcast Domain MUST support service interfaces.

   3.  Service interface MUST be applicable to multihomed peers only.

   4.  Service interface MUST have an Ethernet-Segment identifier
       assignement.

   5.  New service interface handling procedures MUST be backward
       compatible with implementation procedures defined in [RFC7432]

   6.  New service interface MUST support EVPN multicast routes defined
       in [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-igmp-mld-proxy] too.

4.  Solution Description

4.1.  Control Plane Operation

4.1.1.  MAC/IP Address Advertisement

4.1.1.1.  Local Unicast MAC Learning

   [RFC7432] section 9.1 describes different mechanism to learn Unicast
   MAC address locally.  PEs where AC aware bundling is supported, MAC
   address is learnt along with VLAN associated with AC.

   MAC/IP route construction follows mechanism defined in [RFC7432]
   section 9.2.1.  An attach Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community
   (Section 6.1) must be attached to EVPN RT-2.

4.1.1.2.  Remote Unicast MAC Learning

   Presence of Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community (Section 6.1)
   MUST be ignored by non multihoming PEs.  Remote PE (non-multihome PE)
   MUST process MAC route as defined in [RFC7432]

   Multihoming peer MUST process Attachment Circuit ID Extended
   Community (Section 6.1) to attach remote MAC address to appropriate
   AC.

   From Figure 1, PE2 receives MAC route for MAC-1.  It MUST get
   Attachment Circuit ID from Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community
   (Section 6.1) in RT-2 and associate MAC address with specific subnet.

4.1.2.  Multicast Route Advertisement

Internet-Draft  AC-Aware Bundling Service Interface in E   February 2022


4.1.2.1.  Local Multicast State

   When a local multihomed AC in given Broadcast Domain receives IGMP
   membership request, it MUST synchronize multicast state by
   originating multicast route defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-igmp-mld-proxy].  When Service interface is AC
   aware it MUST attach Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community
   (Section 6.1) along with multicast route.  For example in Figure 1
   when H2 sends IGMP membership request for (S,G), CE hashed it to one
   of the PE.  Lets say PE1 received IGMP membership request.  PE1 MUST
   originate multicast route to synchronize multicast state with PE2.
   Multicast route MUST contain Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community
   (Section 6.1) along with multicast route.

   PE1 must originate multicast route updates for any subsequent IGMP
   membership requests under same or different subnet attaching adequate
   Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community (Section 6.1).

4.1.2.2.  Remote Multicast State

   If multihomed PE receives remote multicast route on Broadcast Domain
   for given ES, route MUST be programmed to correct subnet.  Subnet
   information MUST be extracted from Attachment Circuit ID Extended
   Community.  That value maps to the VLAN of a local AC where the
   multicast route is associated to.

4.2.  Data Plane Operation

4.2.1.  Unicast Forwarding

   Packet received from CE must follow same procedure as defined in
   [RFC7432] section 13.1

   Unknown Unicast packets from a Remote PE MUST follow procedure as per
   [RFC7432] section 13.2.1.

   Known unicast Received on a remote PE MUST follow procedure as per
   [RFC7432] section 13.2.2.  In Figure 1, if PE3 receives known unicast
   packet for destination MAC MAC-1, it MUST follow procedure defined in
   [RFC7432] section 13.2.2.

   If destination MAC lookup is performed on known unicast packet,
   destination MAC lookup MUST provide VLAN and local AC information.
   For example if PE2 receives unicast packet which is destined to MAC-1
   (packet might be coming from IRB or remote PE with EVPN tunnel),
   destination MAC lookup on PE2 MUST provide outgoing port along with
   associated VLAN value.

4.2.2.  Multicast Forwarding

   Multicast traffic from CE and remote PE MUST follow procedure defined
   in [RFC7432]

   Multicast traffic received from IRB interface or EVPN tunnel, route
   lookup would be performed based on IGMP snooping state and traffic
   would be forwarded to appropriate AC.

5.  Mis-configuration Across Multihoming Peers

   If there is mis-configuration of VLAN or VLAN range across
   multihoming peers, same MAC address would be learnt with different
   VLAN per Broadcast Domain.  In this case Error message MUST be thrown
   for operator to make configuration changes.  Furthermore, the errored
   MAC route MUST be ignored.

6.  BGP Encoding

   This document defines one new BGP Extended Community for EVPN.

6.1.  Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community

   A new EVPN BGP Extended Community called Attachment Circuit ID is
   introduced.  This new extended community is a transitive extended
   community with the Type field of 0x06 (EVPN) and the Sub-Type of TBD.
   It is advertised along with EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement Route (Route
   Type 2) per [RFC7432] for AC-Aware Bundling Service Interface.  It
   may also be advertised along with EVPN Multicast Route (Route Type 7
   and 8) as per [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-igmp-mld-proxy].  Generically
   speaking, the new extended community must be attached to any routes
   which require specific VLAN identification.

   The Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community is encoded as an 8-octet
   value as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | Type=0x06     | Sub-Type=TBD  |      Reserved (16 bits)       |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |               Attachment Circuit ID (32 bits)                 |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Attachment Circuit ID Extended Community

   The attachment circuit ID plays the role of normalized VID.  It is
   defined as per [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-vpws-fxc].

6.2.  Ethernet-tag Field vs AC ID Extended Community

   The current proposal is entirely backward compabitible with [RFC7432]
   VLAN-aware bundling mode since the Ethernet-tag field remains intact.
   However, it has its own drawbacks.  For instance with multicast, the
   same (S,G) maybe be used over different subnets.  In that case, the
   same route MUST carry multiple AC ID Extended Community; one per
   attachment Circuit ID / VLAN.  It may happen that the number of VLAN
   is faily large.  Multiple routes with different RD may be required to
   carry such amount of Extended Community.  This approach is
   complexifying the overall solution and implementation.

   To remedy to that situation, the attachment Circuit ID MAY be set to
   0xFFFF_FFFF.  That value tells peer PE that the attachment Circuit ID
   is carried has part of the Ethernet Tag field of the associated
   route.  Since the key of the EVPN route is unique, multiple AC ID
   Extended Community per route is no longer required.  There is
   drawback.  It pose backward interoperability issue with PE expecting
   a zero Ethernet-TAG ID.

7.  Security Considerations

   The same Security Considerations described in [RFC7432] are valid for
   this document.

8.  IANA Considerations

   A new transitive extended community Type of 0x06 and Sub-Type of TBD
   for EVPN Attachment Circuit Extended Community needs to be allocated
   by IANA.
