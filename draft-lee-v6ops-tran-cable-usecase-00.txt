Internet-Draft       IPv6 Transition Cable Use Cases        October 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Cable access network primarily uses DOCSIS technology defined by
   CableLabs to deliver IP services to users.  DOCSIS provides an
   abstraction to deliver IP packets over coxial cable.  DOCSIS is a
   shared media technology and use Ethernet for Layer-2, it doesn't use
   PPP or ATM for encapsulation.

   A Cable Modem which is a DOCSIS enabled modem is the device to
   transmit the user's Ethernet frames over DOCSIS to the Cable Modem
   Termination System (CMTS) in the cable operator's network.  DOCSIS
   has gone through few generations.  The most current version is DOCSIS
   3.0.  By specifications, DOCSIS 2.0 and DOCSIS 3.0 both support IPv6
   for cable modem management and user's traffic.  However, DOCSIS 1.x
   specification and some older DOCSIS 2.0's implementations do not.
   Cable operators will take time to retire all the legacy cable modems
   and replace them to the newer version of cable modems.  So there will
   be a transition period to upgrade all the equipments to support IPv6.

   The complexity of upgrading the regional and core network to dual-
   stack is relatively low compared to upgrading the access network to
   support IPv6 for thousands of CMTSes and millions of cable modems and
   CPEs.  So this memo focuses on use cases to enable IPv6 in the cable
   access network.  The transition methodology is to provide dual-stack
   to the users regardless the underneath technology inside a cable
   operator.  When IPv6 services become majority and IPv4 services
   gradually diminish, the operator may consider to provide only IPv6 to
   users and provide IPv4-IPv6 translation in the network when users
   access IPv4 services.  This memo describes use cases to provide dual-
   stack to users because we have more experience.

   We divide the use cases into two primary categories.  The first
   category describes dual-stack deployment to the users using the
   existing access network.  The access network could be IPv4-only or
   dual-stack.  The second category describes dual-stack deployment to
   the users using IPv6-only access network.  The goal of these use
   cases is providing service continuity during the transition.


2.  Offer Dual-Stack on Top of Existing Access Network

   We discuss three use cases that offer dual-stack to users.  The first
   use case describes the scenario where the access network is IPv4-only
   and operators utilize tunneling technologies to give dual-stack
   access to users.  The second use case describes the standard native
   dual-stack deployment model.  The third use cases describes native
   dua-stack where the IPv4 connection may be provided using shared
   public IPv4 addresses (NAT444).

Internet-Draft       IPv6 Transition Cable Use Cases        October 2010


2.1.  IPv4-only Access Network

   According to [I-D.arkko-ipv6-transition-guidelines], native dual-
   stack is the simplest model for transition.  However, this requires
   the entire network to be dual-stack.  Moreover, the provisioning
   system and other support systems must be upgraded to support IPv6.
   Most operators will need to upgrade the network in phases along with
   the provisioning system(s) and supporting systems.  During the
   transition period, there will be IPv4-only islands.  In order to
   offer dual-stack access to users over IPv4 islands, operators may
   consider the use of tunneling technologies such as 6rd and MPLS.

   There are incentives to offer IPv6 to users before completing the
   upgrade.  For example: early IPv6 adopters can start experiencing
   IPv6 services and have connectivity to IPv6-only content should it be
   available.  Operational groups can also being to familiarize
   themselves with IPv6 and being troubleshooting IPv6.  Application
   developers and content providers can start providing services over
   IPv6.  In the end, this may help to speedup the overall IPv6
   adoption.

2.1.1.  6rd

2.1.1.1.  Deployment Requirements

   6rd [RFC5969] is a technology that provides IPv6 connectivity over
   the existing IPv4 access network.  The idea is simple, it leverages
   the 6to4 model [RFC3056] and uses the provider's specific prefix
   instead of the IANA assigned well-known prefix.  This will give the
   operator's control of both ingress and egress flows.  This technology
   has been proven to be successful in real operator deployments
   [RFC5569].

   6rd is comprised of two elements: 6rd-CE and 6rd-BR. 6rd-CE initiates
   an IPv6-in-IP tunnel to the 6rd-BR. 6rd-BR terminates the tunnel and
   forward the IPv6 packets to the IPv6 Internet.  Similar to 6to4, 6rd
   uses the IPv4 address provisioned to the user to construct the IPv6
   address.  Since the IPv4 address is stored in the IPv6 prefix, the
   address translation is stateless.

   6rd works when a user was provisioned with a public IPv4 address.  It
   also works with [RFC1918] address when it is combined with a provider
   NAT44 function in the network.  In this use case, we discuss only the
   public IPv4 address model.

2.1.1.2.  Network Impact

   This describes the egress connection from the 6rd-CE to the IPv6
   Internet.  After the IPv6 packet was encapsulated in an IPv4 packet
   by 6rd-CE, the network will forward the packet similar to any other
   IPv4 packet. 6rd model is transparent to the IPv4 network.  The
   packet will eventually arrive in the closest 6rd-BR for
   decapsulation, then it will be forwarded to IPv6 destination.  The
   "closest" 6rd-BR is defined by the IP address used in combination
   with network routing conditions.

   This describes the ingress connection from the IPv6 Internet to
   6rd-CE.  IPv6 packet with 6rd prefix in the destination address will
   be forwarded normally and arrive to the closest 6rd-BR.  The 6rd-BR
   extracts the IPv4 information from the IPv6 address and encapsulates
   the IPv6 packet in an IPv4 packet.  Then, it will forward the
   encapsulated packet to the IPv4 network.

   The 6rd prefix is advertised by the 6rd-BR or by an upstream router
   on it's behalf.  The operator will advertise this prefix within their
   network and towards the Internet and other neighboring peers.  The
   operator also needs to assign an anycast address to the 6rd-BR.  This
   anycast address will be shared by all the 6rd-BR and will be
   advertised in the operator's IPv4 serving IGP.  The 6rd-CE will send
   the encapsulated packets to this anycast address.

   IPv6 packets are delivered on the IPv6-in-IP tunnel.  MTU is a common
   consideration for any tunnel technology.  Since 6rd is a stateless
   technology, the tunnel endpoints cannot perform fragmentation.  The
   simplest solution is to increase default MTU size larger than 1500
   bytes in the access network.  More discussion can be found in
   [RFC5969].

   Hosts behind the 6rd-CE may not be able to dynamically learn any DNS
   server via SLAAC, so they may query DNS from a DNS server in the IPv4
   network.  The DNS server in the IPv4 network should be configured
   process AAAA records.

2.1.1.3.  Operation Impact

   6rd is a stateless technology.  It greatly simplifies the network
   design for scalability and high availability.  Traffic engineering of
   the tunnels is not explicitly required since the 6rd-BRs are known
   via an IGP (or IGP assisted path).  Operators can add or remove
   6rd-BR in the network without transferring service states from one
   6rd-BR to another 6rd-BR.  Operators also need not assign any
   particular 6rd-BR to a 6rd-CE. 6rd-CE will rely on routing to find
   the closest 6rd-BR.

   6rd is similar to VPN technology. 6rd packets are encapsulated and
   transparent to the network.  Operator can operate, monitor and
   troubleshoot the 6rd network independently.

   Considerations for 6rd include any in-line service or network device
   that monitors, controls or assists with traffic flows.  Since 6rd
   sends IPv6 packets insider an IPv4 tunnel, all such systems must be
   6rd aware to continue to supply the same functions for this new
   traffic type.  Additionally, if an operator has enabled dynamic Q0S
   within their access network, the overall detection, policy and
   enforcement infrastructure will need to be able to manage the control
   of IPv6 flows within an IPv4 tunnel.

2.1.1.4.  CPE Impact

   CPE is required to implement the 6rd-CE specification. 6rd-CE must be
   the first device connecting to the cable modem and is responsible for
   learning the 6rd prefix and construct the 6rd delegated prefix.  The
   CPE is also responsible to advertise the 6rd delegated prefix to
   hosts behind the CPE.  If the CPE implements SLAAC, the hosts behind
   the CPE learns the prefix and default gateway via Router
   Advertisement.  As with the network portion, any service information,
   including QoS, will need to be carefully managed to support the IPv6-
   in-IP function.

2.1.1.5.  Application Impact

   Applications will have dual-stack and should behave identically as of
   running on a native dual-stack host Application which are served via
   IPv6 will add additional load to BRs within the network.  The
   operator may want to take this under consideration if they are
   planning to deploy high bandwidth services over IPv6.  The operator
   may choose to offer some services over IPv4 in this case to lower the
   load on the BRs and allow for more efficient traffic delivery inside
   the network (since the BR and application systems may not share
   network locations).

2.1.2.  MPLS

   TBD

2.2.  Native Dual-Stack Use Case

   Providing native dual-stack to user may be the simplest for
   transition to IPv6, but it requires operators to upgrade the network,
   provisioning systems, and supporting systems to give production grade
   service to users.  In this memo, native dual-stack means to provision
   a public IPv4 address, a global IPv6 address, and a global IPv6

   prefix to a user.

2.2.1.  IPv6 Address Design

   In general, most of the IPv4 address architecture rules still apply
   to the IPv6 address architecture.  For example: each service (e.g.
   VoIP vs. IPTV) should use different prefixes.  Also, operators should
   use two separate prefixes for network infrastructure and customer
   services.

   Due to the high utilization and the allocation policies of IPv4
   prefixes, the result is each organization got many discontinuous
   blocks of prefixes rather than a large aggregate.  The drawback is a
   fairly large Internet routing table.  The overall IPv6 address pool
   is 128-bit long.  Operators are normally given a prefix that contains
   an enormous number of addresses.  If an operator carefully plans for
   address allocation and aggregation, it should only advertise the
   provider's prefix to the IPv6 Internet routing table.  For example:
   each regional network should be a suffix of the overall provider's
   prefix.  The result should be a smaller and more organized Internet
   routing table.  In contrast, bad IPv6 address design may result a
   divided routing table and unnecessarily bubble its size.

2.2.2.  Provisioning

   TBD

2.2.3.  Advertising Customer's Prefixes to the Access Network

   Apart from an IPv6 address assignment to the CPE, the network will
   also delegate a prefix to the CPE for the hosts behind the CPE.  This
   prefix is normally assigned by a DHCP server.  The access network
   will need to learn the prefix and the associated cable modem and CPE.
   [I-D.droms-dhc-dhcpv6-agentopt-delegate] suggests that the DHCP Relay
   Agent which is the CMTS can query the DHCP server and learn the
   prefix.  Then, it installs the prefix into its routing table.
   Another way is the DHCP Relay Agent inspects the DHCP IA_PD reply
   from the DHCP server and installs the prefix to the routing table.
   This topic remains open and more development is coming.

2.2.4.  Benefits of Native Dual Stack

   Utilizing a native dual stack option for IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity
   includes the overall integration ease for the provider.  Although
   this option requires the deployment of IPv6, it is the more
   understood and support option.  Other then standard IPv6
   functionality within the network providers space and in the CPE, no
   new options are necessarily needed.  Many inline services will need

   to support IPv6, but are likely to support IPv6 native before newer
   connectivity options which includes DS-lite, 6rd and other such
   tunneling modes.

2.3.  Native Dual-Stack with Shared IPv4 Addresses Use Case

   This use case is an extension of the previous native dual stack
   option.  In this particular case, all the IPv6 deployment
   considerations are made with an added complexity of shared IPv4
   access.  Shared IPv4 connectivity with a provider controlled NAT44
   function may be required for dual stack deployments after IPv4
   exhaustion.  This option provides many of the same advantages as the
   native dual stack option which includes in the clear IPv4 and IPv6
   flows.  The provider can still utilize existing systems that support
   native IPv4 and IPv6 flows, but will need to add in network
   functionally related to the NAT44 function.


3.  Offer Dual-Stack on IPv6-only Access Network

   When the access network is IPv6-only, IPv6 traffic can be delivered
   natively over IPv6.  So, there is no new requirement to enable IPv6.
   However, the access network will not be able to deliver IPv4
   services.  We provide two use cases to give dual-stack to users in an
   IPv6-only access network.

3.1.  Shared IPv4 Address Use Case

   When IPv4 addresses are limited, operators may consider multiplexing
   IPv4 addresses among internal users.  Users will not be provisioned
   with a public IPv4 address.  Instead, users will share a pool of
   public IPv4 addresses in the network.

   DS-lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] is a technology that
   provides IPv4 access over an IPv6-only access network.  This also
   provides NAT44 functionality in the operator's network to multiplex a
   pool of public IPv4 addresses amongst users.

3.1.1.  DS-lite

3.1.1.1.  Deployment Requirements

   DS-lite is composed of two elements: B4 element and AFTR element.  B4
   element initiates an IP-in-IPv6 tunnel to the AFTR.  AFTR terminates
   the tunnel and performs NAT44.  B4 element can be implemented in a
   CPE or in a host.  For this use case, we only discuss the CPE B4
   element model.

Internet-Draft       IPv6 Transition Cable Use Cases        October 2010


   An operator is required to deploy B4 to user premises.  B4 will
   replace the existing CPE and must be the first network device in
   front of the cable modem.  The operator will provision an IPv6
   address to the B4 element.  It will not provision any IPv4 address to
   the B4.  Operator will also provision an IPv6 Prefix to the B4 and B4
   will advertise this IPv6 prefix to the hosts behind it so that IPv6-
   capable hosts will have native IPv6 services.

   B4 will run as DHCP server to the hosts behind it.  It also acts as
   IPv4 default gateway and DNS proxy to the hosts.  IPv4 packets will
   be delivered over the IP-in-IPv6 tunnel between the B4 and AFTR.
   From the host perspective, it will be provisioned with dual-stack and
   the applications running on the host can decide to use IPv4 or IPv6.

   An operator is required to deploy a set of AFTR elements in the
   network.  The AFTR should be dual-stack to terminate the IP-in-IPv6
   tunnel from B4 elements and deliver NAT-ed packets to IPv4 Internet.

3.1.1.2.  Network Impact

   DS-lite requires the access network to support IPv6.  This requires
   the CMTS and cable modem to be IPv6 enabled.  It also requires to
   deploy a set of AFTR elements in the operator network.  AFTR is a
   stateful network device, it inherits the cost to manage a stateful
   network device inside the network.

   IPv4 packets are delivered on the IP-in-IPv6 tunnel.  This reduces
   the effective MTU side.  Neither hosts behind the B4 element nor
   services in front of the AFTR are aware of the tunnel.  The operator
   can increase the MTU size in the access network.  However, many cable
   modem implementations do not support MTU larger than default 1500
   bytes, so the B4 and AFTR elements must handle fragmentation caused
   by the tunnel overhead.

   The AFTR owns the NAT pool, it will be the aggregation point of the
   IPv4 addresses defined in the NAT pool.  AFTR must advertise the NAT
   pool prefix to the IPv4 Internet.  In contrast, the IPv6 tunnel
   interface should stay only inside the operator's IGP and should not
   be advertised to the IPv6 Internet.

3.1.1.3.  Operation Impact

   DS-lite identifies a user by IPv6 address.  Operators should be
   trained to understand how to map a user from an IPv6 address in the
   AFTR.  AFTR is a NAT device, operator should maintain the NAT binding
   information to satisfy the government regulations.  This is standard
   procedure for operating any NAT44 device.

Internet-Draft       IPv6 Transition Cable Use Cases        October 2010


   DS-Lite introduces the operational mode where historical IPv4
   connectivity (as experienced) is now totally dependent on IPv6.  This
   significant change in operating conditions must be well understood by
   the operator.  If DS-lite is introduced during deployment infancy in
   the operators IPv6 network, it will require careful attention to
   operational practices and capabilities to maintain the IPv6 network.

   AFTR is critical to continuously offer IPv4 access in IPv6-only
   access network.  Operator should scale AFTR to provide non-
   interruptive access to users.  Operators should closely monitor two
   AFTR's resources: (1) Network Capacity and (2) Port Utilization.
   When network capacity is reached, the operator should decide to
   upgrade the AFTR to higher network capacity or to deploy a new AFTR
   to balance the workload.  When port utilization is high, the operator
   should increase the NAT pool size.

   AFTR is stateful, it will complicate the high-availability (HA)
   design.  Operators should apply the standard HA design (e.g. cold or
   hot) which best fits to their network operations.

3.1.1.4.  CPE Impact

   CPE is required to implement the B4 element specification.  Also,
   port-forwarding and UPnP IGD protocol will no longer function.  IETF
   PCP Working Group was formed to address the port-forwarding and UPnP
   IGD issues.

   CPE must know the IPv6 address of the AFTR tunnel interface.  This
   information can be obtained from DHCP.  Since there is only IPv6
   access to the B4 element.  Any IPv4 network service learned from DHCP
   must be proxy by the B4 element.

   If the operator cannot increase the access network MTU size, the B4
   element must handle fragmentation to ensure IPv4 service using
   maximum MTU size won't be affected by the tunnel overhead.

3.1.1.5.  Application Impact

3.1.1.5.1.  Egress Connection

   Since hosts behind B4 are provisioned with dual-stack, the
   application can decide to use IPv4 or IPv6.  If the external service
   is also dual-stack, the host will automatically prefer IPv6 over IPv4
   if the host O/S has implemented [RFC3484].  If the host prefers IPv4
   due to application logic, it will use the private IPv4 address
   provisioned by the B4 element.  For applications expecting to use
   specific source port will be impacted because the AFTR inside the
   network won't be able to allocate a specific source port.

   Applications use random source port will continue to function without
   modification.

3.1.1.5.2.  Ingress Connection

   Similar to traditional NAT, ingress connection will be blocked by
   default.  The current techniques such as port-forwarding and UPnP IGD
   are required modification.  Technically this could be done.  But this
   will requires some changes in user's procedure to enable the service.
   It also adds cost to operators to offer port-forwarding service.

3.2.  Public IPv4 Address Use Case

   Some applications requires specific source port and some applications
   requires ingress connection.  Users using those applications may want
   to be provisioned with a public IPv4 address to ease the potential
   challenges caused by NAT in the network.  IPv4-over-IPv6 (4over6)
   [I-D.cui-softwire-host-4over6] is a simple technology to provision a
   public IPv4 address to a user and provide IPv4 access over an IPv6-
   only network.

3.2.1.  IPv4 Over IPv6

3.2.1.1.  Deployment Requirements

   4over6 consists of two elements: 4over6 Initiator and 4over6 Tunnel
   Concentrator (TC). 4over6 is similar to DS-lite except two features:
   (1) Unlike B4 element, 4over6 Initiator will be provisioned with a
   public IPv4 address. (1) 4over6 TC only terminates the IP-in-IPv6
   tunnel and won't perform any NAT44 function.

   4over6 supports both host and CPE models.  We will only discuss the
   6over6 CPE model.

   An operator is required to deploy 4over6 Initiator in premises.  The
   4over6 initiator will replace the existing CPE and must be the first
   network device in front of the cable modem.  The operator will
   provide an IPv6 address and an IPv6 prefix to the CPE.  The procedure
   is similar to Native IPv6 use case and DS-lite use case.

   4over6 Initiator is very similar to the B4 element.  It serves as
   DHCP server, IPv4 default gateway and DNS server to hosts behind it.
   The only difference is 4over6 will be provisioned with a public IPv4
   address while B4 element will not.  Once 4over6 Initiator discovers
   the 4over6 TC, it will issue standard DHCP request over the tunnel to
   the 4over6 TC.  The 4over6 TC either relays the DHCP request to a
   centralized DHCP server or replies to the request if it is the
   authoritative DHCP server for the 4over6 service.  Once the CPE

   acquires the public IPv4 address, the user can run all his legacy
   IPv4 applications similar to what he is doing with a regular IPv4
   home gateway.

3.2.1.2.  Network Impact

   Similar to DS-lite, the access network must support IPv6.  This
   requires the CMTS and cable modem must be IPv6 enabled.  It also
   requires the operator to deploy a set of 4over6 TC in the network.

   Despite no NAT in the 6over4 TC, 6over4 TC is required to maintain
   the 4over6 Initiate IPv6 address (tunnel-id) and IPv4 address
   binding.  Also, the 4over6 TC must advertise the IPv4 prefix to the
   Internet.  It is the aggregation point of the IPv4 address prefix.

   4over6 suffers the same MTU limitation which is common to any tunnel
   protocols.  Please refer to Section 3.1.1.2 for details.

3.2.1.3.  Operation Impact

   Since each user will be assigned a public IPv4 address, it doesn't
   require operator to log any binding.  Operator should be able to
   identify a user by either IPv4 or IPv6 address.

   Similar to AFTR, network capacity and IPv4 address utilization are
   critical resources to 4over6 TC.  Operator must closely monitor the
   resources to ensure continuous IPv4 access.

   Operators also need to coordinate the IPv4 address space in the DHCP
   server and the 4over6 Initiator which manages the space.  This
   requires careful coordination and management.

3.2.1.4.  CPE Impact

   CPE is required to implement the 4over6 TC specification.  Unlike B4
   element, port-forwarding and the UPnP IGD will work without
   modification.

3.2.1.5.  Application Impact

   Applications will have dual-stack and should behave identically as of
   running on a native dual-stack host.
