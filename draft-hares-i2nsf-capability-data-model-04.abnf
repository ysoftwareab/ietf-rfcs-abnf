   o  If an I2NSF User wants to apply rules for blocking malicious
      users, it is a tremendous burden for the I2NSF User to apply all
      of these rules to NSFs one by one.  This problem can be resolved
      by standardizing the capabilities of NSFs.  If the I2NSF User
      wants to block malicious users with IPv6, the I2NSF User sends the
      rules for blocking the users to the Network Operator Mgmt System.
      When the Network Operator Mgmt System receives the rules, it sends
      those rules to appropriate NSFs (e.g., NSF-m in Developer's Mgmt
      System A and NSF-1 in Developer's Mgmt System B) which can support
      the capabilities (i.e., IPv6).  Therefore, the I2NSF User need not
      consider what NSFs to apply the rules to.

   o  If NSFs find malicious packets, it is a tremendous burden for the
      I2NSF User to apply the rule for blocking the malicious packets to
      NSFs one by one.  This problem can be resolved by standardizing
      the capabilities of NSFs.  If NSFs find the malicious packets with
      IPv4, they can ask the Network Operator Mgmt System to alter
      specific rules and/or configurations.  When the Network Operator
      Mgmt System receives the rules for malicious packets, it inspects
      whether the rules are reasonable or not, and then sends the rules
      to appropriate NSFs (e.g., NSF-1 in Developer's Mgmt System A, and
      also NSF-1 and NSF-n in Developer's Mgmt System B) which can
      support the capabilities (i.e., IPv4).  Therefore, the new rules
      can be applied to appropriate NSFs without the intervention of the
      I2NSF User.

   o  If NSFs of Service Function Chaining (SFC) [i2nsf-sfc] fail to
      work, it is a significant overhead for the I2NSF User to
      reconfigure the policy of SFC immediately.  This problem can be
      resolved by periodically acquiring the information of appropriate
      NSFs under SFC.  If SFF needs the information of an NSF (e.g., Web
      Application Firewall) for SFC, it can ask the Network Operator
      Mgmt System to acquire the location information of the NSF.  When
      the Network Operator Mgmt System receives the requested
      information from an SFF, it sends the location information of the
      NSF to the SFF.  Therefore, the policy about the NSFs under SFC
      can be periodically updated without the intervention of the I2NSF
      User.
