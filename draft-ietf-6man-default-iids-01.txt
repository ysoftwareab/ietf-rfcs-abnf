          Recommendation on Stable IPv6 Interface Identifiers
                    draft-ietf-6man-default-iids-01

Abstract

   The IPv6 addressing architecture defines Modified EUI-64 format
   Interface Identifiers, and the existing IPv6 over various link-layers
   specify how such identifiers are derived from the underlying link-
   layer address (e.g., an IEEE LAN MAC address) when employing IPv6
   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).  The security and
   privacy implications of embedding hardware addresses in the Interface
   Identifier have been known and understood for some time now, and some
   popular IPv6 implementations have already deviated from such schemes
   to mitigate these issues.  This document changes the recommended
   default Interface Identifier generation scheme to that specified in
   RFC7217, and recommends against embedding hardware addresses in IPv6
   Interface Identifiers.  It formally updates RFC2464, RFC2467,
   RFC2470, RFC2491, RFC2492, RFC2497, RFC2590, RFC3146, RFC3572,
   RFC4291, RFC4338, RFC4391, RFC5072, and RFC5121, wihch require IPv6
   Interface Identifiers to be derived from the underlying link-layer
   address.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC4862] specifies Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for
   IPv6 [RFC2460], which typically results in hosts configuring one or
   more "stable" addresses composed of a network prefix advertised by a
   local router, and an Interface Identifier (IID) [RFC4291] that
   typically embeds a hardware address (e.g., an IEEE LAN MAC address).

   The security and privacy implications of embedding a hardware address
   in an IPv6 Interface ID have been known for some time now, and are
   discussed in great detail in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy]; they include:

   o  Network activity correlation

   o  Location tracking

Internet-Draft            Default Interface-IDs             October 2014


   o  Address scanning

   o  Device-specific vulnerability exploitation

   Some popular IPv6 implementations have already deviated from the
   traditional stable IID generation scheme to mitigate the
   aforementioned security and privacy implications [Microsoft].

   As a result of the aforementioned issues, this document recommends
   the implementation of an alternative scheme ([RFC7217]) as the
   default stable Interface-ID generation scheme, such that the
   aforementioned issues are mitigated.

   NOTE: [RFC4291] defines the "Modified EUI-64 format" for Interface
   identifiers.  Appendix A of [RFC4291] then describes how to transform
   an IEEE EUI-64 identifier, or an IEEE 802 48-bit MAC address from
   which an EUI-64 identifier is derived, into an interface identifier
   in the Modified EUI-64 format.

2.  Terminology

   Stable address:
      An address that does not vary over time within the same network
      (as defined in [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Generation of IPv6 Interface Identifiers

   Nodes SHOULD NOT employ IPv6 address generation schemes that embed
   the underlying hardware address in the Interface Identifier.  Namely,
   nodes SHOULD NOT generate Interface Identifiers with the schemes
   specified in [RFC2464], [RFC2467], [RFC2470], [RFC2491], [RFC2492],
   [RFC2497], [RFC2590], [RFC3146], [RFC3572], [RFC4338], [RFC4391],
   [RFC5121], and [RFC5072].

   Nodes SHOULD implement and employ [RFC7217] as the default scheme for
   generating stable IPv6 addresses with SLAAC.

   Future specifications SHOULD NOT specify IPv6 address generation
   schemes that embed the underlying hardware address in the Interface
   Identifier.

4.  Future Work

   At the time of this writing, the mechanisms specified in the
   following documents are not compatible with the recommendations in
   this document:

   o  RFC 6282 [RFC6282]

   o  RFC 4944 [RFC4944]

   o  RFC 6755 [RFC6775]

   It is expected that that future revisions or updates of these
   documents will address the aforementioned issues such that the
   requirements in this documents can be enforced.

5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA registries within this document.  The RFC-Editor
   can remove this section before publication of this document as an
   RFC.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document recommends [RFC7217] as the default scheme for
   generating IPv6 stable addresses with SLAAC, such that the security
   and privacy issues of Interface IDs that embed hardware addresses are
   mitigated.
