   Transition Router (AFTR) and Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4) elements
   are covered by this specification.  As a reminder, Figure 1
   illustrates an overview of the DS-Lite architecture that involves
   AFTR and B4 elements.

Internet-Draft                DS-Lite YANG                  October 2017


   DS-Lite deployment considerations are discussed in [RFC6908].

   This document follows the guidelines of [RFC6087], uses the common
   YANG types defined in [RFC6991], and adopts Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA).

1.1.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the terms defined in Section 3 of
   [RFC6333].

   The terminology for describing YANG data modules is defined in
   [RFC7950].

   The meaning of the symbols in tree diagrams is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams].

2.  DS-Lite YANG Modules: An Overview

   As shown in Figure 1:

   o  The AFTR element is a combination of an IPv4-in-IPv6
      encapsualtion/decapsulation function and a NAT function.

   o  The B4 element is an IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation function.

   Therefore, the AFTR YANG module is designed to augment both the
   Interfaces YANG module [RFC7223] and the NAT YANG module
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-nat-yang] with DS-Lite specific features.  The B4
   YANG module augments the interfaces YANG module.

   Concretely, the AFTR YANG module (Figure 2) augments the Interfaces
   YANG module with the following:

   o  An IPv6 address used by the AFTR for sending and receiving IPv4-
      in-IPv6 packets (aftr-ipv6-address).

   o  An IPv4 address that is used by the AFTR for troubleshooting
      purposes (aftr-ipv4-address): According to [RFC6333], that address
      can be used to report ICMP problems and will appear in traceroute
      outputs.

   o  The tunnel MTU to avoid fragmentation (tunnel-mtu): Since using an
      IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation to carry IPv4 traffic over IPv6 reduces
      the effective MTU of the datagram, operators should be able to
      increase the MTU size by at least 40 bytes to accommodate both the
      IPv6 encapsulation header and the IPv4 datagram without
      fragmenting the IPv6 packet (Section 2.2 of [RFC6908]).

Internet-Draft                DS-Lite YANG                  October 2017


   o  A policy to limit the number of DS-Lite softwires per subscriber
      (max-softwire-per-subscriber): This policy aims to prevent a
      misbehaving subscriber from mounting several DS-Lite softwires
      that would consume additional AFTR resources (e.g., get more
      external ports if the quota were enforced on a per-softwire basis,
      consume extra processing due to a large number of active
      softwires) [RFC7785].

   o  A DSCP marking policy to be followed when encapsulating/
      decapsulating packets (v6-v4-dscp-preservation): Section 2.10 of
      [RFC6908] discusses the uniform model which assumes that
      implementations of this model copy the DSCP value to the outer IP
      header at encapsulation and copy the outer header's DSCP value to
      the inner IP header at decapsulation.  Operators should configure
      the AFTR so that it copies the DSCP value in the IPv4 header to
      the Traffic Class field in the IPv6 header, and vice versa.

   In addition, the AFTR YANG module augments the NAT YANG module (nat-
   policy, in particular) with the following:

   o  A policy to instruct the AFTR whether a state can be automatically
      migrated (state-migrate): This policy avoids stale mappings at the
      AFTR and minimizes the risk of service disruption for subscribers.
      According to [RFC7785], the AFTR should migrate existing state to
      be bound to the new IPv6 address in the event a new IPv6 address
      is assigned to the B4 element.  This operation ensures that
      traffic destined to the previous B4's IPv6 address will be
      redirected to the newer B4's IPv6 address.

   o  An instruction to rewrite the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS)
      option (mss-clamping) to avoid TCP fragmentation.

   Given that the NAT44 table of the AFTR element is extended to include
   the source IPv6 address of incoming packets, the AFTR YANG module
   augments the NAT mapping-entry with the following:

   o  b4-ipv6-address which is used to record the source IPv6 address of
      a packet received from a B4 element.  This IPv6 address is
      required to disambiguate between the overlapping IPv4 address
      space of customers.

   o  The value of the Traffic Class field in the IPv6 header as
      received from a B4 element (v6-dscp): This information is used to
      preserve DSCP marking when encapsulating/decapsulationg at the
      AFTR.

   o  The IPv4 DSCP marking of the IPv4 packet received from a B4
      element (internal-v4-dscp): This information can be used by the
      AFTR fro enforcing the poi

   o  The IPv4 DSCP marking as set by the AFTR in its external interface
      (external-v4-dscp): An AFTR can be instructed to preserve the same
      marking or to set it to another value when forwarding an IPv4
      packet upstream.

   Examples to illustrate the use of this module are provided in

   The B4 YANG module (Figure 3) augments the Interfaces YANG module
   with the following:

   o  An IPv6 address used by a B4 element for sending and receiving
      IPv4-in-IPv6 packets (b4-ipv6-address).

   o  The IPv6 address of the AFTR to use by a B4 element (aftr-

   o  An IPv4 address that is used by a B4 element for troubleshooting
      purposes (b4-ipv4-address).

   o  The tunnel MTU at the B4 side to avoid fragmentation (tunnel-mtu).

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the support of SSH is mandatory to
   implement secure transport [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control
   model [RFC6536] provides means to restrict access for particular
   NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF
   protocol operations and contents.

   All data nodes defined in the YANG module which can be created,
   modified and deleted (i.e., config true, which is the default).
   These data nodes are considered sensitive.  Write operations (e.g.,
   edit-config) applied to these data nodes without proper protection
   can negatively affect network operations.

Appendix A.  Examples

   The following example shows an AFTR that is reachable at 2001:db8::2.
   Also, this XML snippet indicates that the AFTR is provided with an
   IPv4 address (192.0.0.1) to be used for troubleshooting purposes such
   as reporting problems to B4s.  Moreover, the AFTR is instructed to
   limit the number of softwires per subscriber to '1'.

   <interface>
      <name>myAFTR</name>
      <type>ianaift:tunnel</type>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
      <aftr-ipv6-address>2001:db8::2</aftr-ipv6-address>
      <aftr-ipv4-address>192.0.0.1</aftr-ipv4-address>
      <max-softwire-per-subscriber>1</max-softwire-per-subscriber>
   </interface>

   The following shows an XML excerpt depicting a dynamic UDP mapping
   entry maintained by a DS-Lite AFTR.  In reference to this example,
   the UDP packet received with a source IPv6 address (2001:db8::1), a
   source IPv4 address (192.0.2.1) and source port number (1568) is
   translated into a UDP packet having a source IPv4 address
   (198.51.100.1) and source port (15000).  The lifetime of this mapping
   is 300 seconds.
