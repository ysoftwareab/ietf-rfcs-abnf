   transformations which might be necessary for some deliveries, such as
   fax.

   It was suggested to us in private email to expand this to be
   multipart/report, which allows non-parsable data to be sent to the
   SMTP client.  As the examples below show, this data can be a audio or
   a fax (tiff-f) image.  However, this may be too unwieldy for many
   uses of Session.

   Another idea is a one-line response that indicates Session delivery
   status as in-progress or completed, which makes combining responses
   easier as well.


0.1.2.  STAT for each recipient or all recipients

   The authors have been asked to create a single command to query
   delivery status for all recipients (instead of requiring a separate
   STAT command for each recipient, as this memo is currently written).

   If we use DSNs, this is not possible unless we send multiple
   multipart/reports (or multiple message/delivery-status) because DSNs
   aren't designed to be coalesced.

1.  Abstract

   This memo defines an extension to SMTP which provides a mechanism for
   requesting and verifying immediate message delivery over SMTP.


2.  Introduction

   Historically, SMTP [SMTP] has been used for store and forward
   delivery of messages.  This memo describes a new SMTP extension
   called SESSION.  This new extension allows an SMTP client to request
   immediate delivery by the SMTP server.

   The SESSION extension allows for immediate delivery of mail; it
   presumes either a direct connection between sender and recipient or a
   chain of session-enabled servers in which each supports the SESSION
   extension.

   If an MTA in the SMTP "path" does not support SESSION, delivery
   automatically falls back to normal store and forward, and such
   fallback is communicated to the SMTP client, as described in section
   4.1.

   Unlike the deprecated SAML, SOML and SEND commands (documented in
   [SMTP] and deprecated in [DRUMS]) the SESSION extension allows for a
   mix of immediate and store & forward delivery recipients.

   The SESSION extension was motivated by an analysis of the
   requirements for using the Internet to deliver fax messages, and,
   coupled with a mechanism for exchanging capabilities and preferences
   of sender and recipient, can be used by email<->fax gateway
   applications.  In addition, the SESSION extension may be useful for
   other messaging applications where immediate delivery and
   confirmation are requested.

   This memo uses the mechanism described in [SMTP-EXT] to define an
   extension to the SMTP protocol for immediate delivery.

2.2.  Conventions used in this document

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.  If such lines are wrapped without a new "C:" or
   "S:"  label, then the wrapping is for editorial clarity and is not
   part of the command.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [REQ].


3.  Framework for immediate delivery support

   The immediate message delivery is defined as follows:

     (1)  The name of the immediate extension is Session;

     (2)  the EHLO keyword value associated with the immediate extension
          is SESSION;

     (3)  no parameter is used with the SESSION EHLO keyword;

     (4)  one new SMTP verb, STAT (used to retreive an in-line DSN), is
          defined with this extension, and is described in section 6;

     (5)  one optional parameter is added to the RCPT command, using the
          esmtp-keyword SESSION, and is described in section 5,

          no parameters are added to the MAIL FROM command;

     (6)  the maximum length of a RCPT TO is increased by 8 characters.


4.  Esmtp-keyword SESSION

   Upon receiving a RCPT command with the esmtp-keyword SESSION, a
   session-enabled server will normally send either a positive (2xx) or
   negative (5xx) reply to the SMTP client.

   A 250 reply code indicates that the session-enabled server believes
   the message will be sent immediately -- that is, that the request for
   SESSION delivery will be honored.  Note that SESSION delivery can
   subsequently fail due to disk space exhaustion, disk quotas, failure
   of a remote MTA, loss of connectivity to a remote MTA, or other
   reasons.  The MTA that detected the failure may attempt to deliver
   the message via store-and-forward -- the SMTP client may use the STAT
   command to determine the delivery status of the message.



Wing, Joffe, Masinter      Expires April 1998                  [Page 4]

Internet Draft          SMTP Immediate Delivery            November 1997


   If a session-enabled server is unable to send a message immediately
   (that is, the request for SESSION will not be honored), but the
   session-enabled server is willing to send the message via store-and-
   forward, it MUST respond with a 252 reply code.  The SMTP client can
   use this information to inform the user that immediate delivery isn't
   available, and the SMTP client (or the user) may decide to abort the
   SMTP transaction.


5.  New SMTP verb STAT

   One new SMTP verb is introduced with the Session extension.  The STAT
   verb allows a client to query the session delivery status for all
   recipients in this mail transaction.

   The STAT command, and the server's reply to STAT, are sent along the
   SMTP "path".  Using the diagram in section 4, the SMTP client (A)
   would send a STAT command to (B), and (B) would forward the STAT
   command to (C), which forwards it to (D).  (D) generates the reply to
   STAT which is echoed back through the MTAs until it is finally sent
   by (B) to (A).

   The syntax of the STAT verb, using the notation described in [ABNF],
   is:

        stat-cmd = "STAT" SP <forward-path> CR LF

   The reply to the STAT command is called an ``in-line Delivery Status
   Notification'', or ``in-line DSN''.

   The SMTP server MUST respond to a STAT command no later than 60
   seconds after a STAT command is received.  After 120 seconds an SMTP
   client MAY assume the connection to the SMTP server is broken.


5.1.  Format of in-line Delivery Status Notification

   The reply to STAT is a multipart/report as defined in [MIME-RPT].
   However, note that this Session extension does NOT require the
   session-enabled SMTP server also implement Delivery Status
   Notifications [SMTP-DSN].

   Each line of the multipart/report is sent following the rules for
   SMTP replies.  In the notation described in [ABNF]:

        inline-dsn    = *( "250-" [status-code SP] dsn-line CR LF )
                           "250 " [status-code SP] dsn-line CR LF

Internet Draft          SMTP Immediate Delivery            November 1997


        dsn-line      = <each line of the multipart/report from [MIME-
        RPT]>

        status-code   = <This is <status-code> of section 4 of [SMTP-
                         ENH-ERR] if SMTP server implements [SMTP-ENH-
                         ERR]>
        text          = <any CHAR except CTL>

   Note that the information returned can include extension fields, such
   as those defined in [FAX-DSN].


5.2.  Per-recipient DSN extension

   [DSN] permits extension fields to be defined.  The following new
   per-recipient DSN extension is defined for each recipient that had
   the esmtp-keyword SESSION.  In the notation described in [ABNF]:

      extension-field = "Session-Delivery" *WSP ":" *WSP
                        session-status

      session-status  = "delivered" / "in-progress" / "queued"

   The <extension-field> and <session-status> can be spelled in any
   combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.

   "delivered"    Session delivery was successful.  Message was
                  delivered to the recipient immediately.  This is a
                  terminal value.

   "in-progress"  Session delivery has not yet completed.  A STAT
                  command issued later will show final status of this
                  message.  This is the only non-terminal value.

   "queued"       Session delivery failed for some reason, but the MTA
                  was able to successfully queue the message using
                  normal SMTP store-and-forward.  One cause of this
                  status is when the session-enabled server forwards the
                  message to a non-session-enabled server.  This is a
                  terminal value.

   Once a terminal value in-line DSN has been sent for a specific
   forward-path, the SMTP server does not need to include that forward-
   path in subsequent STAT replies.  If an SMTP client sends a STAT
   command and the SMTP server has already informed the SMTP client that
   all recipients had a terminal values, the SMTP server should return a
   503 reply.

5.3.  Delivery notifications and STAT

   During normal store and forward operation and in the absence of
   special RFC822 headers (such as Return-Receipt-To, Generate-
   Delivery-Report described in [HEADERS]), only a delivery failure
   causes a message to be generated (commonly called a `bounce').

   If an SMTP server implments [SMTP-DSN], the SMTP client may request a
   delivery status notification, and such a request may be for actions
   other than delivery failure (such as SUCCESS or DELAY).

 XXX A session-enabled server SHOULD NOT send such a `bounce' (or DSN)
 message if the recipient included the esmtp-keyword SESSION, and the
 SMTP server can be positive that the SMTP client has already received
 the same information from the in-line delivery status notification.

 For example, if the SMTP client sends a QUIT command after the SMTP
 server has sent the in-line delivery status notification, the SMTP
 server knows the SMTP client has successfully received the in-line
 delivery status notification.

 XXX - bzzt:  pipelining allows the "." and QUIT commands to be sent at
 the same time.  How should we resolve this problem?

   If the RCPT command included the esmtp-keyword SESSION, any DSN
   generated must include the DSN per-recipient extension defined in
   section 5.2 -- omission of this extension implies "Session-Delivery:
   queued" (because the message was sent through an MTA that doesn't
   support SESSION).


5.4.  Usage of [DSN] fields

   For Session recipients, the <will-retry-until-field>, described in
   [DSN], can be used to indicate when the SMTP server will stop
   attempting to deliver the Session message.  Note it is not possible
   to determine if the Delivery-Status will be "queued" or "delivered"
   except by querying via another STAT command.

   XXX - Is this going to be sufficient for our FAX needs?  We could add
        more things, like bytes, pages, seconds-to-completion for in-
        progress.  Would another extension be useful to indicate how
        long it took to send the fax (for billing)?


6.  Behavior with multiple hop delivery

   Both the esmtp-keyword SESSION and the new SMTP verb STAT require

Internet Draft          SMTP Immediate Delivery            November 1997


   special behavior when dealing with multiple-hop delivery.  Multiple-
   hop delivery occurs when the sending mailer isn't communicating
   directly with the receiving mailer -- that is, there are intervening
   mail transfer agents (MTAs) between the sending mailer and the
   receiving mailer.


6.1.  esmtp-keyword SESSION

   The following sections describe the behavior of the SMTP server when
   a RCPT command contains the esmtp-keyword SESSION.


6.1.1.  SESSION local delivery

   In the case of a local delivery, the SESSION keyword causes the
   session-enabled server to attempt immediate delivery of the message
   to the local user's mailbox.


6.1.2.  SESSION relayed delivery

   The following diagram is used to help describe the relayed delivery
   behavior.  The diagram depicts a user agent sending mail to two
   recipients with the esmtp-keyword SESSION, and each recipient has a
   different MTA.

                                 +-------+    +-----------+
                             -=> | MTA-1 | => | receiving |  user@host-x
                            /    |       |    |   MTA-1   |
   +-----+    +--------+   /     +-------+    +-----------+
   | user| => |Original| =<         (C)           (D)
   |agent|    |  MTA   |   \
   +-----+    +--------+    \    +-------+    +-----------+
     (A)         (B)         -=> | MTA-2 | => | receiving |  user@host-y
                                 |       |    |   MTA-2   |
                                 +-------+    +-----------+
                                    (E)           (F)

   In the case of several MTAs in the SMTP 'path', as in the above
   diagram, the RCPT command with the esmtp-keyword SESSION is forwarded
   to the next MTA (before the current MTA responds to the RCPT command)
   until finally the RCPT command is sent to the 'last' MTA which
   actually sends a reply.  The reply is then echoed back along the SMTP
   'path'.

   Thus in the above diagram, if (A) issued two RCPT commands, the order
   of processing is as follows:



Wing, Joffe, Masinter      Expires April 1998                  [Page 8]

Internet Draft          SMTP Immediate Delivery            November 1997


       (1)  A>B:  ... normal SMTP initiation sequence...
       (2)  A>B:  RCPT TO:<user@host-x> SESSION
       (3)  B>C:  ... normal SMTP initiation sequence...
       (4)  B>C:  RCPT TO:<user@host-x> SESSION
       (5)  C>D:  ... normal SMTP initiation sequence...
       (6)  C>D:  RCPT TO:<user@host-x> SESSION
       (7)  D>C:  220 <user@host-x> okay
       (8)  C>B:  220 <user@host-x> okay
       (9)  B>A:  220 <user@host-x> okay
      (10)  A>B:  RCPT TO:<user@host-y> SESSION
      (11)  B>E:  ... normal SMTP initiation sequence...
      (12)  B>E:  RCPT TO:<user@host-y> SESSION
      (13)  E>F:  ... normal SMTP initiation sequence...
      (14)  E>F:  RCPT TO:<user@host-y> SESSION
      (15)  F>E:  220 <user@host-y> okay
      (16)  E>B:  220 <user@host-y> okay
      (17)  B>A:  220 <user@host-y> okay

   The DATA command is also handled in a parallel function, such that a
   single DATA command from (A) is transmitted to (B), which then sends
   a DATA command to both (C) and (E).  During mail data transfer, each
   MTA is expected to stream the network data to the next MTA (or to the
   local user's mailbox, as appropriate) -- that is, the data should be
   sent from the MTA while it is being received.

   When (B) receives the end-of-mail indicator, it must reply to (A) as
   soon as possible to prevent duplicate messages as described in
   [DUPLICATE].

   The MTA at (C) and (D) must likewise reply to the end-of-mail
   indicator as soon as possible.


6.1.3.  Excessive delays with multiple MTAs

   The cumulative delays of going through many MTAs will cause Session
   delivery to fail (by falling back to normal store-and-forward).
   Proper configuration and deployment of SMTP servers will prevent this
   problem.

   Implementors must carefully design session-enabled MTAs to respond
   quickly when Session recipients are present to minimize timing
   problems.


7.  Implementation notes

Internet Draft          SMTP Immediate Delivery            November 1997


7.1.  SMTP server reply to STAT

   To prevent excessive network activity by an SMTP client querying
   delivery status "too often", the SMTP server may delay responding to
   a client's STAT command.  Such a delay MUST NOT exceed 10 seconds.


7.2.  PIPELINING implementation recommendation

   Due to the delays inherent with establishing connections with each
   MTA in the SMTP "path", SMTP servers that implement this SESSION
   extension SHOULD also implement [SMTP-PIPE].  This permits the SMTP
   client to send the STAT command immediately after the end-of-mail-
   data indicator, without waiting for the SMTP server's reply to the
   end-of-mail-data indicator.


8.  Security Considerations

   Denial of service attacks are possible with SESSION.

   XXX - more verbage


9.  Examples


9.1.  Successful Session delivery to two recipients

   This example shows a successful Session delivery with two recipients.
   The first recipient, masinter@parc.xerox.com, was still being queued
   when the first STAT command was sent by the client, but a subsequent
   STAT command shows the final status.

   Note also that the in-line DSN for njoffe@cisco.com includes a both a
   TIFF (fax format) and audio reply, which may be used directly by some
   mail user agents.  This is merely an example to show how in-line DSNs
   might be useful for low-end SMTP clients; a good SMTP server
   implementation would only special content-types if it had reason to
   believe the SMTP client could use them.
