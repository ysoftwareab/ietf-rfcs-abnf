1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)
   which is used between a Path Computation Element (PCE) and a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) (or other PCE) to enable computation of
   Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) for Traffic Engineering Label
   Switched Path (TE LSP).  PCEP Extensions for the Stateful PCE Model
   [RFC8231] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable active
   control of MPLS-TE and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) tunnels.  As depicted
   in [RFC4655], a PCE MUST be able to compute the path of a TE LSP by
   operating on the TED and considering bandwidth and other constraints
   applicable to the TE LSP service request.  The constraint parameters
   are provided such as metric, bandwidth, delay, affinity, etc.
   However these parameters can't meet the network slicing requirements.

   A PCE always perform path computation based on the network topology
   information collected through BGP-LS [RFC7752].  BGP-LS can get
   multiple link-state data from multiple IGP instance, or multiple
   virtual topologies from a single IGP instance.  It is necessary to
   restrict the PCE to a small topology scope during path computation
   for some special purpose.  BGP-LS can also get application specific
   TE attributes for a link, it is also necessary to restrict PCE to use

   TE attributes of specific application.  The PCE MUST take the
   identifier of slicing into consideration during path computation.

   This document proposes a set of extensions for PCEP to support the TE
   constraints during path computation, e.g, IGP instance, virtual
   network, Slice-id, specific application, color template and FA-id
   etc.

2.1.  Terminology

   The terminology is defined as [RFC5440] and [RFC7752].

2.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  PCEP Extensions for TE Constraints

   As defined in [RFC5440] , the LSPA object is used to specify the LSP
   attributes to be taken into account by the PCE during path
   computation such as TE constraints.  This document proposes several
   new TLVs for the LSPA object to carry TE constraints in Network
   Slicing.

3.1.  Source Protocol TLV

   The Source Protocol TLV is optional and is defined to carry the
   source protocol constraint.

   In a PCReq/PCRpt message, a PCC MAY insert one or more Source
   Protocol TLVs to indicate the source protocol that MUST be considered
   by the PCE.  If more than one Source Protocol TLVs are carried, the
   PCE may perform path computation based on the sub-topology identified
   by the one of the source protocols.  The absence of the Source
   Protocol TLV MUST be interpreted by the PCE as a path computation
   request for which no constraints need be applied to any of the source
   protocols.

   In a PCRep/PCInit/PCUpd message, the Source Protocol TLV MAY be
   carried so as to provide the source protocol information for the
   computed path.

   The code point for the TLV type is TBD1.  The TLV length is 12
   octets.

   Protocol-ID (8 bits): defined in [RFC7752] section 3.2.

   Reserved (24 bits): This field MUST be set to zero on transmission
   and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   Identifier (64 bits): defined in [RFC7752] section 3.2.

3.2.  Multi-topology TLV

   The Multi-topology TLV is optional and is defined to carry the multi-
   topology protocol constraint.

   In a PCReq message, a PCC MAY insert one Multi-topology TLV to
   indicate the sub-topology of an IGP instance that MUST be considered
   by the PCE.  The PCE will perform path computation based on the sub-
   topology identified by the specific Multi-Topology ID within a source
   protocol.  The absence of the Multi-topology TLV MUST be interpreted
   by the PCE as a path computation request for which no constraints
   need be applied to any of the multi-topologies.

   In a PCRep/PCInit/PCUpd message, the Multi-topology TLV MAY be
   carried so as to provide the Multi-topology information for the
   computed path.

   The Multi-topology TLV MUST be carried after a Source Protocol TLV,
   if not it MUST be ignored.

   The format of the Multi-topology TLV is shown as Figure 2:

   The code point for the TLV type is TBD2.  The TLV length is 4 octets.

   Multi-Topology ID (12 bits): Semantics of the IS-IS MT-ID are defined
   in Section 7.2 of [RFC5120].  Semantics of the OSPF MT-ID are defined
   in Section 3.7 of [RFC4915].  If the value is derived from OSPF, then
   the upper 9 bits MUST be set to 0.  Bits R are reserved and SHOULD be
   set to 0 when originated and ignored on receipt.

   Reserved (16 bits): This field MUST be set to zero on transmission
   and MUST be ignored on receipt.

3.3.  Slice-id TLV

   PCEP message needs to carry Slice ID to let the scope of path
   calculation to be limited in a specific slice.

   There are many control plane technologies to realize slicing.  Some
   control plane technologies may directly maintain resources per slice
   granularity in the link-state database, only for the case with small
   slice scalability.  [I-D.bestbar-teas-ns-packet] proposes a more
   scalable slicing scheme.  The resource information in link-state
   database is identified by SA-ID to distinguish the logical topologies
   corresponding to different slice-aggregate.  Within the controller, a
   slice-aggregate includes one or more slices mapped to it.  If the
   number of slices is small, the resources per slice granularity can be
   maintained directly in the link-state database.  In this case,
   different slice may be mapped to different slice-aggregate.  If the
   number of slices is large, it is not recommended to maintain the
   slice granularity resources in the link-state database, but the
   aggregated SA-ID granularity.

   In any case, the slice service (such as VPN service) perceives the
   Slice ID (not others), so it is natural for the service to include a
   Slice ID constraint in its TE purpose definition.  For example, VPN
   routes may have Color attribute (refer to
   [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps] and
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy]).  Color represents a

   specific TE purpose, which can contain a Slice ID.  Thus it is
   natural carry Slice ID in PCEP message.

   When the controller receives the path computation request with a
   Slice ID constraint, it can use the resources identified by specific
   Slice in TED, or firstly look up the Slice ID to SA-ID mapping entry
   and then use the resources of specific SA-ID in TED, to calculate the
   path.

   In a PCReq message, a PCC MAY insert one Slice-id TLV to indicate the
   slice based virtual network that MUST be considered by the PCE.  The
   PCE will perform path computation based on the intra-domain or inter-
   domain sub-topology identified by the specific Slice-id, which is
   independent of routing protocols such as IGP/BGP.  The absence of the
   Slice-id TLV MUST be interpreted by the PCE as a path computation
   request for which no constraints need be applied to any of slice,
   i.e, a default Slice-id (0) will be applied.

   In a PCRep/PCInit/PCUpd message, the Slice-id TLV MAY be carried so
   as to provide the network slicing information for the computed path.
   The headend may put the Slice-id to an encapsulated data packet.

   The format of the Slice-id TLV is shown as Figure 3:

   The code point for the TLV type is TBD3.  The TLV length is 4 octets.

   Slice-id (32 bits): indicate the Slice-id information.  The Slice-id
   is also termed as AII defined in [I-D.peng-lsr-network-slicing] to
   represent an IETF Network Slice that is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition].

3.4.  Application Specific TLV

   application specific constraints.

   In a PCReq message, a PCC MAY insert one Application Specific TLV to
   indicate the application that MUST be considered by the PCE.  The PCE
   will perform path computation using the specific application
   attributes.  The absence of the Application Specific TLV MUST be
   interpreted by the PCE as a path computation request for which no
   constraints need be applied to any of the Application Specific
   attributes.

   In a PCRep/PCInit/PCUpd message, the Application Specific TLV MAY be
   inserted so as to provide the Application Specific information for
   the computed path.

   The format of the Application Specific TLV is shown as Figure 4:

   application which is a specific implementation.

3.5.  Color TLV

   The Color TLV is optional and is defined to carry the color
   constraints.

   In a PCReq message, a PCC MAY insert one Color TLV to indicate the
   traffic engineering purpose that is recognized by both PCE and PCC
   with no conflict meaning.  The PCE will perform path computation
   based on the color template.  The same color template may be also
   defined at PCC and the existing constraints (i.e, metric, bandwidth,
   delay, etc) carried in the message MUST be ignored.  The absence of

   the Color TLV MUST be interpreted by the PCE as a path computation
   request for which traditional constraints that are contained in
   message need be applied.

   In a PCRep/PCInit/PCUpd message, the Color TLV MAY be inserted so as
   to provide the TE purpose information for the computed path, the PCC
   recognize the color value that match a local color-template.  For
   example, the COLOR TLV can be used to identify the Color of each
   Candidate Path in the Composite Candidate Path as decribed in

   The code point for the TLV type is TBD5.  The TLV length is 4 octets.

   Color (32 bits): indicate a TE template, 0 is invalid value.  It is
   consistent with the Color Extended Community defined in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps], and color of SR policy defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

   Note that Color TLV defined in this document is used to represent a
   TE template, it can be suitable for any TE instance such as RSVP-TE,
   SR-TE, SR-policy.  [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp] has
   proposed the SR policy KEY (that also includes a color information)
   as an association group KEY to associate many candidate paths,
   however it is only for association purpose but not constraint purpose
   for path computation.

   A color template can be defined to contain existing constraints such
   as metric, bandwidth, delay, affinity parameters, and the sub-
   topology constraints above defined in this document.

3.6.  FA-id TLV

   FA-id defined in [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo] is a short mapping of SR
   policy color to optimize segment stack depth for the IGP area partial
   of the entire SR policy.  The overlay service that want to be carried
   over a particular SR-FA path must firstly let the SR policy supplier
   know that requirement.  There are two possible ways to map a color to
   an FA-id.  One is explicit mapping configuration within color
   template, the other is dynamicly replacing a long segment list to
   short FA segment by headend or controller once the constraints
   contained in the color-template equal to that contained in FAD.

   In addition to the above mapping behavior, it is also possible to
   merge the constraints contained in the color-template and constraints
   contained in FAD.  The merging behavior can be used to compute SR-TE
   path within a Flex-algo plane.

   In a PCReq message, a PCC MAY insert one FA-id TLV to indicate the
   above explicit FA-id mapping or merging.  For mapping case, the PCE
   will perform path computation based on the FA-id mapping.  In
   detailed, The PCE will check if there are connectivity within the
   corresponding Flex-algo plane to the destination.  If yes, the path
   computation result will be represented as segment list with a single
   prefix-SID@FA for intra-domain case, or several prefix-SID@FA for
   inter-domain case.

   For merging case, the PCE will perform path computation based on the
   total constraints combinded with the ones contained in FAD identified
   by FA-id and other ones contained in PCReq message.  The later
   constraints can get from color template or directly represent by a
   color.  In this case the computed path will be limited in the
   specific Flex-algo plane determined by link resource Including/
   Excluding rules of FAD, and at the same time the path will also meet
   other constraints for the TE purpose within the Flex-algo plane.  The
   PCE can optimize the strictly path to a loosely path when a part of
   the strictly path is consistent with the algorithm based path, i.e,
   some consecutive adjacency SIDs can be replaced with a single
   algorithm based Prefix-SID.

   In a PCRep/PCInit/PCUpd message, the FA-id TLV MAY be inserted so as
   to provide the FA plane information for the computed path.

   In general, the FA-id TLV is only meaningful for the domain (ingress
   domain) that headend node belongs to.  For inter-domain case,
   operator SHOULD ensure the FA-id configuration of different domain
   are same for an E2E slice, when he want to explicitly indicate FA-id
   in PCEP message, otherwise the PCE has to choose different FA-id for

   one of ingress domain.

   The code point for the TLV type is TBD6.  The TLV length is 4 octets.

   FA-id (8 bits): indicate an explicit FA-id mapping information.

   Flags (8 bits): Currently only one flag, Flag-M, is defined.

   Flag-M: Indicate mapping behavior when unset, and merging behavior
   when set.
