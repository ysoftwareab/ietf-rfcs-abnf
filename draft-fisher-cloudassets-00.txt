                        draft-fisher-cloudassets-00


Abstract

   There is no standardized method to describe assets used in a cloud
   such that they can be moved from one cloud to the next independent
   of the underlying architecture. This document defines Cloud Assets
   as a lightweight description of cloud resources and proposes a
   standardization of Cloud Assets into three major categories:
   Resource Assets, Component Assets, and Composite Assets.

1. Introduction

1.1. Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document:

   o  Cloud Assets - The basis for building provisioning, and testing
      of cloud-based environments.

   o  Cloud Environments - The user implementation of a cloud
      infrastructure.

   o  Cloud Infrastructure - Infrastructure as a servcie that a user
      can consume from anywhere over the Internet. The cloud focuses on
      providing consumers the required capabilities rather than
      specific backend compute resources.

   o  Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS) - a standardized, highly
      automated offering, where compute resources, complemented by
      storage and networking capabilities are owned and hosted by a
      service provider and offered to customers on-demand. Users are
      able to self-provision this infrastructure, using a Web-based
      graphical user interface that serves as an IT operations
      management console for the overall environment. API access to the
      infrastructure may also be offered as an option. [2]

   o  Resource Assets - Elements of a cloud infrastructure registered
      by the cloud administrator.

   o  Cloud Administrator - An entity that administers the
      infrastructure supporting the cloud.

   o  Component Assets - Elements of a cloud environment imported by
      the user.

   o  Composite Assets - Combinations of resource and component assets
      into defined entities

   o  Virtual Machine - a software implementation of a complete system
      platform that supports the execution of a complete operating
      system and corresponding applications in a cloud. [1]

1.2. Background

   As more and more cloud infrastructure choices become available for
   consumers, the difficulty in choosing the cloud that best supports
   the customers needs throughout their application lifecycle becomes
   increasingly difficult. No cloud is a "one size fits all" and
   enabling use of different cloud providers at different points in the
   application lifecycle will better enable consumers to focus on
   meeting user requirements rather than infrastructure dependencies.
   This document describes a method to help standardize how assets are
   used in clouds so that they can be more easily migrated from one
   cloud to the next as needs dictate.

2. Requirements

   This document assumes the following requirements:

   o  Cloud agnostic - usable by any underlying cloud technology

   o  Loosely coupled - cloud updates will not break the asset

   o  Human readable - configurable by any text editor

   o  Flexible - supports wide range of use cases

   o  Lightweight - does not include underlying OS itself

   o  Reusable - well documented so that others can leverage

3. Use Cases

   The following use cases drove the development of the proposed
   standard:

   o  Moving assets to/from commercial cloud provider from/to private
      cloud provider

   o  Moving assets from one commercial cloud provider to another

   o  Moving assets from one security classification level to another

   o  Common assets enabling security compliance across clouds

   o  Leveraging knowledge across teams working in different clouds

   o  Migration from data center to cloud

4. Cloud Assets

   We propose the definition and structure of Resource, Component, and
   Composite Assets.

4.1. Resource Assets

   Resource assets are elements of a cloud infrastructure that are
   registered to be available for use. The Cloud Administrator controls
   which resources they want to allow access to. Resource assets
   include the following: Clouds, Cloudspaces, Cloud Networks,
   Templates, Devices, and Appliances

4.1.1. Clouds

   The account used to access a portion of IaaS cloud provider (e.g.,
   Amazon Web Services, Google, Azure, or private cloud).

4.1.2. Cloudspaces

   A private space within a cloud with separate security boundary &
   access control (e.g. VMware Virtual Data Center or AWS Virtual
   Private Cloud).

4.1.3. Cloud Networks

   The networks in a Cloud that are accessible to the Cloudspace.

4.1.4. Templates

   Base installation of operating system into a virtual machine. Also
   known as images.

4.1.5. Devices

   A device or service that is accessible from the cloud.

4.1.6. Appliances

   A preconfigured (aka not configurable) virtual machine that is
   accessible from the cloud.

4.2. Component Assets

   Component Assets are imported by a user with appropriate permissions
   and used as building blocks for the construction, configuration and
   validation of cloud environments. Components assets include the

Internet-Draft               Cloud Assets                September 2016


   following: Software: Applications, Software: Source Code, Software:
   Data, Test Cases, Virtual Services, and Networks.

4.2.1. Software: Applications

   Applications include software installers, utilities and
   configurations.

4.2.2. Software: Source Code

   Software that is used to check out, build and install un-compiled
   code.

4.2.3. Software: Data

   Data assets are data sets available for use by other assets. Fewer
   required components; optional encryption.

4.2.4. Test Cases

   Description and properties used to perform functional, performance,
   and/or security validation tasks.

4.2.5. Virtual Services

   Virtual services are models representing the data inputs and outputs
   of a service.

4.2.6. Networks

   New networks created in the Cloud that are accessible in the
   Cloudspace.

4.3. Composite Assets

   Composite assets are combinations of resource and component assets
   that define how and environment will be built, configured and
   deployed (often referred to as recipes, blueprints, or manifests).
   Composite assets include: Systems, Scenarios, Deployments, and Test
   Bundles.

4.3.1. Systems

   A single system (e.g. virtual machine) that includes:

   o  One template

   o  Zero or more Software: Application assets

   o  Zero or more Software: Source Code assets

   o  Zero or more Software: Data assets

   o  One or more Network assets

4.3.2. Scenarios

   A Scenario asset includes one or more System assets and zero or more
   Virtual Service assets.

4.3.3. Deployments

   A Deployment asset includes at least one Scenario asset and zero or
   more Test Bundle assets.

4.3.4. Test Bundles

   A Test Bundle asset includes at least one Test Case asset.

7. Security Considerations

   One should be aware of and consider the variety of security best
   practices when working with XML and implement methods that best
   support your application of Cloud Asset descriptions. Consider
   especially using checksums to detect errors and verify data
   integrity.
