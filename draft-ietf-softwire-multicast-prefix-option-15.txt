1.  Introduction

   Several solutions (e.g., [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast]) are
   proposed for the delivery of multicast services in the context of
   transition to IPv6.  Even if these solutions may have different
   applicable use cases, they all use specific IPv6 addresses that embed
   IPv4 addresses, for both multicast group and source addresses.

   This document defines a DHCPv6 option [RFC3315] that carries the IPv6
   prefixes to be used for constructing these IPv4-embedded IPv6
   addresses.

   In particular, this option can be used in the context of DS-Lite
   [RFC6333], Stateless A+P [RFC6346], and other IPv4-IPv6 transition
   techniques.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   IPv4-embedded IPv6 address:  an IPv6 address which embeds a 32 bit-
      encoded IPv4 address [RFC6052].  An IPv4-embedded IPv6 address can
      be a unicast or a multicast address.

   Prefix64:  is an IPv6 prefix used for synthesizing IPv4-embedded IPv6
      addresses.  A Prefix64 can be of unicast or multicast.

         Note: "64" is used as an abbreviation for IPv6-IPv4
         interconnection.

   ASM_mPrefix64:  a multicast Prefix64 which belongs to the Any-Source
      Multicast (ASM) range.

   SSM_mPrefix64:  a multicast Prefix64 which belongs to the Source-
      Specific Multicast (SSM) [RFC4607] range.

   uPrefix64:  a unicast Prefix64 for building the IPv4-embedded IPv6
      addresses of multicast sources in SSM mode.

3.  OPTION_V6_PREFIX64 DHCPv6 Option

   OPTION_V6_PREFIX64 (Figure 1) conveys the IPv6 prefix(es) to be used
   (e.g., by an mB4 [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast]) to synthesize
   IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses.

   The fields of the option shown in Figure 1 are as follows:

   option-code:  OPTION_V6_PREFIX64 (see Section 7).

   option-length:  length of the option, in octets.

   asm-length:  the prefix-length for the ASM IPv4-embedded prefix, as
      an 8-bit unsigned integer.  This field represents the number of
      valid leading bits in the prefix.  This field MUST be set to 96.

   ASM_mPrefix64:  this field identifies the IPv6 multicast prefix to be
      used to synthesize the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses of the
      multicast groups in the ASM mode.  The conveyed multicast IPv6
      prefix MUST belong to the ASM range.

   ssm-length:  the prefix-length for the SSM IPv4-embedded prefix, as
      an 8-bit unsigned integer.  This field represents the number of
      valid leading bits in the prefix.  This field MUST be set to 96.

   SSM_mPrefix64:  this field identifies the IPv6 multicast prefix to be
      used to synthesize the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses of the
      multicast groups in the SSM mode.  The conveyed multicast IPv6
      prefix MUST belong to the SSM range.

   unicast-length:  the prefix-length for the IPv6 unicast prefix to be
      used to synthesize the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses of the
      multicast sources, as an 8-bit unsigned integer.  As specified in
      [RFC6052], the unicast-length MUST be one of 32, 40, 48, 56, 64,
      or 96.  This field represents the number of valid leading bits in
      the prefix.

   uPrefix64:  this field identifies the IPv6 unicast prefix to be used
      in SSM mode for constructing the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses
      representing the IPv4 multicast sources in the IPv6 domain.
      uPrefix64 may also be used to extract the IPv4 address from the
      received multicast data flows.  It is a variable size field with
      the length of the field defined by the unicast-length field and is
      rounded up to the nearest octet boundary.  In this case, any
      additional padding bits must be zeroed.  The address mapping MUST
      follow the guidelines documented in [RFC6052].

   Multiple instances of OPTION_V6_PREFIX64 may be returned to a DHCPv6
   client.  Configuration recommendations for DHCP servers are listed in
   Appendix A.

   Note that it was tempting to define three distinct DHCPv6 options,
   but that approach was not adopted because it has a side effect: the
   specification of a DHCPv6 option that could be used to discover
   unicast Prefix64s in environments where multicast is not enabled.
   Such side effect conflicts with the recommendation to support the
   Well-Known DNS Name heuristic discovery-based method for unicast-only
   environments (Section 6 of [RFC7051]).

4.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   To retrieve the IPv6 prefixes that will be used to synthesize unicast
   and multicast IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses, the DHCPv6 client MUST
   include OPTION_V6_PREFIX64 code in its OPTION_ORO.  If the DHCPv6
   client receives more than one OPTION_V6_PREFIX64 option from the
   DHCPv6 server:

   o  If each enclosed IPv6 multicast prefix has a distinct scope
      [RFC7346], the client MUST select the appropriate IPv6 multicast
      prefix whose scope matches the IPv4 multicast address used to
      synthesize an IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address.

   o  If at least two of the received options convey IPv6 multicast
      prefixes that have the same scope, the said options MUST be
      discarded.

   If asm-length, ssm-length and unicast-length fields are all set to 0,
   the DHCPv6 client MUST behave as if OPTION_V6_PREFIX64 had not been
   received in the response received from the DHCPv6 server.

   If the asm-length field is non-null, the IPv6 prefix identified by
   ASM_mPrefix64 is used to synthesize IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast
   addresses in the ASM range.  This is achieved by concatenating the
   ASM_mPrefix64 and the IPv4 multicast address; the IPv4 multicast
   address is inserted in the last 32 bits of the IPv4-embedded IPv6
   multicast address.

   If the ssm-length field is non-null, the IPv6 prefix identified by
   SSM_mPrefix64 is used to synthesize IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast
   addresses in the SSM range.  This is achieved by concatenating the
   SSM_mPrefix64 and the IPv4 multicast address; the Pv4 multicast
   address is inserted in the last 32 bits of the IPv4-embedded IPv6
   multicast address.

   If the unicast-length field is non-null, the IPv6 prefix identified
   by uPrefix64 is used to synthesize IPv4-embedded IPv6 unicast
   addresses as specified in [RFC6052].

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations documented in [RFC3315] and [RFC6052] are
   to be considered.

Appendix A.  Configuration Recommendations for DHCP Servers

   This appendix details a set of non-normative configuration
   recommendations:

   o  DHCP servers supporting OPTION_V6_PREFIX64 must be configured with
      ASM_mPrefix64 or SSM_mPrefix64, and may be configured with both.

   o  uPrefix64 must also be configured when SSM_mPrefix64 is provided.

   o  uPrefix64 may be configured when ASM_mPrefix64 is provided.

      Note that uPrefix64 is not mandatory for the ASM case if, for
      example, a local address mapping algorithm is supported or the
      Well-Known Prefix (64:ff9b::/96) is used.

   o  Both ASM_mPrefix64 and SSM_mPrefix64 may be configured and
      therefore be returned to a requesting DHCP client in the same
      OPTION_V6_PREFIX64.  In particular, if both SSM and ASM modes are
      supported, ASM_mPrefix64 and SSM_mPrefix64 prefixes must be
      configured.  For SSM deployments, both SSM_mPrefix64 and uPrefix64
      must be configured.

   o  When a multicast Prefix64 (ASM_mPrefix64 or SSM_mPrefix64) is
      configured, the length of the prefix must be /96.

Internet-Draft     IPv4/IPv6 Multicast Prefixes Option     February 2017


   o  When distinct IPv6 multicast address scopes [RFC7346] are required
      to preserve the scope when translating IPv4 multicast addresses
      (Section 8 of [RFC2365]), each scope is configured as a separate
      OPTION_V6_PREFIX64.  How DHCP servers are configured to separate
      multicast Prefix64 per scope is implementation-specific and not
      covered by this document.

   o  When scope preservation is not required, only one instance of
      OPTION_V6_PREFIX64 is configured.
