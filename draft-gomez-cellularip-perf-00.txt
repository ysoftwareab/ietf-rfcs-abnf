Abstract

   Cellular IP specifies a protocol that allows routing IP datagrams to
   a mobile host. The protocol is intended to provide local mobility and
   handoff support. It can interwork with Mobile IP [1] to provide wide
   area mobility support. This I-D provides performance results based on
   the implementation and analysis of Cellular IP as defined by draft
   draft-valko-cellularip-01.txt [2]. The evaluation is focused on
   handoff performance, optimum active-state-timeout choice and
   scalability issues. The Cellular IP source code used for the
   experimental results presented in this Internet-Draft is freely
   available from comet.columbia.edu/cellularip.

1. Introduction

   Cellular IP inherits cellular technology principles for mobility
   management, passive connectivity and handoff support, but implements
   these around the IP paradigm. The universal component of a Cellular
   IP network is the Cellular IP node that serves as wireless access
   point but at the same time routes IP packets and integrates cellular
   control functionality traditionally found in Mobile Switching Centers
   (MSC) and Base Station Controllers (BSC). The nodes are built on
   regular IP forwarding engine, but IP routing is replaced by Cellular
   IP routing and location management. The Cellular IP network is
   connected to the Internet via a gateway router. Mobile hosts attached
   to the network use the IP address of the gateway as their Mobile IP
   care-of address.

   In Cellular IP, location management and handoff support are
   integrated with routing. To minimize control messaging, regular data
   packets transmitted by mobile hosts are used to establish host
   location information. Uplink packets are routed from a mobile host to
   a gateway on a hop-by-hop basis. The path taken by these packets is
   cached in intermediate nodes. To route downlink packets addressed to
   a mobile host the path used by recent packets transmitted by a mobile
   host is reversed. When the mobile host has no data to send then it
   transmits ICMP IP packets called route-updates to the gateway to
   maintain its downlink routing soft-state. Following the principle of
   passive connectivity commonly found in cellular systems mobile hosts
   that have not received packets for some period of time allow their
   downlink routes be cleared from the caches as dictated by soft-state
   timers. In order to route packets to idle hosts a Cellular IP
   mechanism called paging is used.

   The source code for Cellular IP v1.0 [4] developed at Columbia
   University is freely available (comet.columbia.edu/cellularip) for
   experimentation. This Internet-Draft provides an overview of the
   source code design and implementation. In addition, the experimental
   results presented in this memo are based on the public domain source
   code operating on a Cellular IP testbed built at Columbia University.

   specification of the protocol see [2].

2. Implementation

   Cellular IP is based on modular software design and is implemented on
   FreeBSD 3.2 software platforms in user space. Cellular IP is
   comprised two protocol modules: the node and mobile host modules.
   Both protocol modules rely on a common system module. The system
   module filters IP packets from the physical medium and moves them to
   user space and delivers packets processed in user space to the
   required network interface. The system module uses the Berkeley
   Packet Filter's Packet Capture library (PCAP). In what follows, we
   describe the node and mobile host protocol modules.

2.1. Node Module

   As described previously, the Cellular IP node serves as wireless
   access point, router and location manager. In addition, our
   implementation allows a node to also implement the gateway
   functionality relying on the kernel's IP routing function. In our
   implementation, the uplink and downlink neighbors are configured by
   network management. This is in contrast to the gateway beacon
   approach discussed in [2]. Along with the routing and (optional)
   paging cache, the most important functions of the node include:

   - a paging update function, which maintains the paging cache by
   updating it for each uplink packet and by clearing expired mappings;

   - a classifier, which parses uplink packets and selects those that
   should update the routing cache (data, route-update and semisoft
   packets);

   - a route update function, which maintains the routing cache by
   updating it for each packet selected by the classifier and clears
   expired mappings;

   - a routing cache lookup function, which parses downlink packets and
   searches the routing cache for mapping(s) associated with the
   destination mobile host;

   - a paging cache lookup function, which searches the paging cache for
   mappings if a routing cache mapping was not found;

   - a forwarding engine, which forwards downlink packets to the
   interface selected by routing cache lookup in the first instance and
   by paging cache lookup if no route was found; and

   - a delay device, which is temporarily inserted in the downlink route
   if a semisoft handoff is in progress.

   Our implementation uses 2 Mbps 2.4 GHz WaveLAN radio devices, but the
   protocol module can transparently interwork with other radio
   interfaces. Note that the source code also works with a variety of
   higher speed radios (e.g., Aironet's 11 Mbps and WaveLAN IEEE 802.11



Campbell, Gomez, Kim, Turanyi, Valko,Wan       Expires May 2000 [Page 3]

   10/6 Mbps cards). A Cellular IP node may have multiple air interfaces
   or no air interface at all if it serves as a concentrator node only.
   In addition to the functions described above, the node contains a
   beacon generator for each wireless interface. In Cellular IP, the
   content of the beacon is similar to the standard WaveLAN beacon but
   is extended with the gateway's IP address.

2.2. Mobile host module

   The mobile host module is implemented as a deamon that in our
   experimental testbed runs in user space. The standard IP protocol
   stack is not touched by the Cellular IP deamon and applications are
   unaware of mobility. The main elements of the deamon are as follows:

   - a handoff controller, which keeps statistics of measured beacon
   strengths and decides and performs handoff. Handoff mainly involves
   the setting of radio frequency and changing the IP default route to a
   new node's address. In the case of the semi-soft handoff mode, a
   semi-soft packet is first transmitted to the new base station has
   part of the mobile initiated handoff procedure and after a constant
   time delay the handoff is completed to the new base station.

   - a protocol state machine, which has two states: active and idle
   state. In idle state, any incoming packet triggers a transition to
   active state. At the same time, a timer is initiated that is reset by
   each incoming packet. The expiration of the timer triggers the
   transition to idle state.

   - a control packet generator, which periodically transmits route-
   update or paging-update packets as required by the state machine. The
   packet generator also monitors outgoing packet to stop transmitting
   control packets when data is being transmitted.

3. Evaluation

   To evaluate Cellular IP performance we have built a testbed and
   designed a set of experiments to analyze the Cellular IP algorithms
   discussed in [2]. In what follows we describe our Cellular IP testbed
   configuration and experimental results.

3.1 The Experiments

   The goal of the experiments is to evaluate the performance and
   scalability of the Cellular IP protocol. An important object of the
   first experiment is to analyze the performance of hard and semi-soft
   handoffs and to investigate the impact of handoff on TCP performance.
   The second experiment investigates the cost of setting the active-
   state-timeout. In the third and last experiment we investigate the
   scalability limits of a node based on off the shelf multi-homed PC
   hardware. This experiment provides some insight into what would be
   achievable for a Cellular IP node built from commodity hardware,
   operating systems and air-interfaces. The experimental results of the
   Cellular IP node implementation are therefore conditioned more by the
   technology used than the protocol itself.

   All of the experiments described below were conducted using the
   configuration of shown in Figure 1. The Cellular IP network consists
   of three nodes, all multi-homed 300 MHz Pentium PCs. One of the nodes
   also serves as gateway router. 100 Mbps full duplex links
   interconnects Cellular IP nodes and the gateway is connected to a 100
   Mbps Ethernet LAN. In the experiments, the correspondent host is a
   Sun SPARCstation 5 with Solaris operating system. The mobile host is
   a 300 MHz Pentium PC notebook. The mobile host and the nodes are
   equipped with WaveLAN 2.4 GHz radio interfaces. These devices can
   operate at eight different frequencies to avoid interference between
   adjacent cells. In the testbed the nodes stations are statically
   assigned frequencies while the mobile can dynamically change
   frequency to perform a handoff. Throughout the experiments the mobile
   host is in the overlapping region of the cells which gave us full
   control over handoffs. We have extended the mobile host's
   implementation with a utility that can periodically trigger handoffs
   regardless of the signal strength observed at the mobile host under
   experiment. A handoff initiated by this utility tool is identical to
   a handoff triggered by signal strength measurements at the mobile
   host.

3.2. Handoff Performance

   In this experiment we measured packet loss for hard and semi-soft
   handoff. During these measurements the mobile host receives 100 byte

   UDP packets at rates of 25 and 50 packets per second (pps) while
   continually making handoffs between nodes B2 and B3 every 5 seconds.
   The measurement results are shown in Table 1. Each point in the table
   was obtained by averaging loss measurements over 50 consecutive
   handoffs. To vary the round-trip time between the mobile host and B1,
   we emulate an increasing load that results in an increased buffering
   of downlink packets. Table 1 shows that hard handoff causes packet
   losses proportional to the round-trip time and to the downlink packet
   rate. Under these experimental conditions hard handoff results in at
   least 1 packet loss for small mobile to gateway round-trip delays and
   up to 4 packet losses for delays of 80 ms.

   Figure 2. Downlink Packet Loss during Handoff
   URL:http://comet.columbia.edu/cellularip/publications/draft-gomez-
   cellularip-perf-00.pdf

   Table 1 also shows packet loss that results from using Cellular IP
   semi-soft handoff [2]. The experimental conditions for semi-soft and
   hard handoff were identical. In these experiments, the new downlink
   packet stream was delayed by one buffer holding for each packet until
   the arrival of the next downlink packet. See [3] for full details.
   When the semi-soft handoff is complete, the last packet is cleared
   from the delay device [3] buffer and is forwarded to the mobile host.

   Table 1 illustrates that semi-soft handoff eliminated packet loss
   entirely. Note that buffering a single packet in the delay element is
   sufficient to eliminate loss even in the case of a large round-trip
   time when hard handoff resulted in the loss of up to four packets.
   This is because semi-soft buffering is only used to compensate for
   the difference between the transmission times along the old and new
   paths and not for the entire round-trip time between the mobile and
   the cross-over point.

   In the next experiment, we studied the impact of handoff performance
   on TCP Reno throughput. The mobile host performed continuous handoff
   between B2 and B3 at fixed time intervals. We measured TCP throughput
   using ttcp by downloading 16 MBytes of data from the correspondent
   host to the mobile host. Each data point represents an average of 6
   independent measurements. TCP throughput to a mobile host performing
   hard handoff is shown in Table 2. The throughput measured at zero
   handoff frequency (i.e., under no handoff conditions) is slightly
   less than the 1.6 Mbps achieved using standard IP forwarding in the
   same configuration. This difference between IP and Cellular IP

   forwarding is attributed to the fact that IP is implemented in the
   kernel and Cellular IP in user space. In addition, Cellular IP uses
   PCAP to forward packets, which is not optimized for IP forwarding. We
   observe that the performance of TCP degrades as the handoff frequency
   increases due to packet loss. As the handoff rate increases TCP has
   less time to recover from loss forcing it to operate below its
   optimal point and resulting in a significant drop in performance as
   the handoff rate moves toward one per second.

   The next experiment investigated the improvement gained using the
   semi-soft handoff. The experimental condition for the semi-soft and
   hard handoff measurements were identical. Table 2 also shows TCP
   throughput to a mobile host that performs semi-soft handoffs at
   increasing rates. Semi-soft handoff reduced packet loss and
   significantly improved the throughput in relation to hard handoff.

   cellularip-perf-00.pdf

   However, unlike in the UDP traffic experiment, packet loss is not
   entirely eliminated which is reflected in the decline of throughput
   at increasing handoff frequency. We attribute this to the fact that
   the delay we inserted in the downlink packet stream by buffering
   packets is tied to the packet inter-arrival time which is both
   shorter and more irregular in a TCP flow than in our UDP example. To
   introduce sufficient delay even if a few packets arrive back-to-back,
   we changed the semi-soft delay element to an 8-packet circular
   buffer. Table 2 shows the performance results using this delay
   element. Here, packet loss at handoff is entirely eliminated and a
   slight disturbance only remains due to the transmission delay
   variations encountered at handoff. We point out that even for one
   handoff per second, the throughput is almost identical to that
   observed for a static host. This result looks very promising.

3.3. Active-State-Timeout

   Now we analyze the tradeoff involved in the setting of the active-
   state-timeout. In Table 3, we show paging traffic rate measured in
   the testbed using a set of typical Internet applications. It must be
   noted that these values depend heavily on the user behavior and this
   data is presented for illustrative purposes only.

   Our measurements involved 4 minute sessions where the route-update
   time is 100 ms and a recently created route has a validity time of
   300 ms. In the telnet and WWW sessions the mobile host is the client.
   We collected data from two sets of measurements for two different
   active-state-timeout values. As discussed in [2], this parameter
   determines the time a mobile host maintains its routing cache
   mappings after receiving a packet. In other words, the active-state-
   timeout reflects the expectation that one downlink packet may with
   high probability be soon followed by another and that it is worth
   keeping up-to-date routing information for some time, despite the
   cost associated with transmitting route-update packets. Indeed, as
   Table 3 shows, taking a larger active-state-timeout decreases the
   paging traffic for all applications. The difference between
   applications is also intuitive. An interactive application (e.g.,
   telnet) sends one or more packets to the server triggering some
   action on the server side. This in turn results in new packet(s)
   being sent back. In the case of a local server, paging only occurs
   when the time to process the request exceeds the active-state-
   timeout. This is rare, hence the low paging rate for local telnet
   sessions. The packet round-trip time adds to the server processing
   time for remote sessions. Table 3 shows that in some cases the total
   response time exceeded 1 sec in this example.

                           Rate of Paging Traffic to Mobile [bps]

                    | telnet   telnet    WWW    WWW      VIC         VIC

   Figure 4. Paging Traffic Rate Generated by Some Applications
   URL:http://comet.columbia.edu/cellularip/publications/draft-gomez-
   cellularip-perf-00.pdf

   A similar difference can be observed between the local and remote WWW
   sessions. In this case paging occurs when the response time exceeded
   the active-state-timeout. We observe that this is rare when accessing
   a local server but frequent in the case of remote communications. In
   addition, when large amounts of data are downloaded TCP sometimes
   stalls which also resulted in paging being triggered for any pauses
   that exceeded the active-state-timeout. Our final example application
   is VIC. With the mobile host being the receiver of the video stream,

   we note that the state machine at the mobile host rarely moves to
   idle state since each incoming packet resets the active-state-
   timeout. Because of the relatively large data rate (500 kbps) in our
   experiment the paging rate is significant, however. We observed that
   when the mobile host transmits packet video then the downlink packets
   only carry quality of service information and paging rate is
   negligible.

3.4. Scalability

   The main concern in terms of scalability is the use of per-host
   routes. We believe that there has to be per-host state in the access
   network to support high performance handoff. In Cellular IP
   scalability is achieved despite per host routes by separating the
   location management of idle from active mobile hosts. Data packets
   are normally routed by route cache mappings. The size of the route
   cache is determined by the number of mobile hosts in active state at
   any one time. This way the Cellular IP network can accommodate very
   large number of mobile hosts without having to search large data
   bases for each packet and This separation principle is fundamental to
   scalability as per-host state is to handoff performance in a Cellular
   IP network.

   In following experiment we investigate the performance of our node
   implementation. Table 4 shows the node throughput for linear and
   binary-tree search algorithms measured on a multi-homed 300 MHz
   Pentium PC using ttcp and 1500 byte packets. In these measurements we
   substituted a 100 Mbps Ethernet connection for the radio interface
   and created routing cache mappings for random IP addresses to emulate
   a large active user population. The fact that the throughput curve is
   hardly decreasing with increasing routing cache size (binary-tree
   search) suggests that in the studied scenarios the performance
   bottleneck was not the cache lookup time. To verify this assumption
   we also measured the throughput that a single traffic stream achieved
   using standard IP forwarding through the multi-homed PC. As shown in
   Table 4, the Cellular IP node throughput is somewhat below the
   standard IP throughput due to the additional packet processing
   involved with PCAP and additional packet copies across kernel and
   user space domains. In our implementation, the routing cache is
   stored in a binary tree to achieve fast lookups. We also measured the
   performance of the search algorithm and found that the maximum packet
   rate can be well approximated as

                                     2,500,000
                                   ______________
                                   1 + 2 log(n)

   where n is the number of mappings in the cache. This explains that
   the performance bottleneck was found to be the network interface
   throughput rather then the search time over the range measured. For
   significantly larger user populations the cache lookup would likely
   become a bottleneck too. We did not, however, verify this thesis due
   to memory size constraints and unavailability of network interfaces
   that operated in excess of 100 Mbps. To illustrate this phenomenon we

   also experimented with linear search instead of the binary tree. The
   throughput measured for the linear case is presented in Table 4 and
   shows that when the user population exceeds 100 the cache lookup
   becomes the bottleneck. When the user population reaches 5000 the
   maximum throughput obtained is drastically diminished.

   The advantage of using paging is now clear from the results. If for
   example, a network serves n mobile hosts at a time, 0.1*n active at a
   time, then we can scale up the results obtained in Table 4 by a
   factor of 10 for example. In addition, with state-of-the-art L2
   hardware Cellular IP will out perform these results in terms of the
   number of users that can be supported. This means that scalability
   limits are promising, but no doubt there are limits. However this is
   the price paid for the simplicity of the protocol design and smooth
   handoff support. This confirms the strength of Cellular IP as an
   access technology that can interwork with Mobile IP to provide global
   mobility.

   Another way to leverage the scalability problem created by using
   per-host routes is to shorten the validity times of active entries in
   the routing cache and/or reducing the duration that a mobile host
   actively keeps its route updated as in the case of active state.
   These two procedures further limit the number of valid entries in a
   routing cache thus reducing route searching times to a minimum for
   incoming packets. Shortening validity times of routing entries can
   only be achieved at the expense of increasing the transmission rate
   of route-update packets in mobile hosts. On the other hand, by
   reducing the active-state-timeout value the mobile host can limit the
   period of time it keeps its route updated (e.g., transmit route-
   update packets) after it received the last packet. Therefore a
   compromise between the size of the routing cache and the load of
