3. Document Organization

The subsequent portion of this draft is organized into the following 
major sections:

* Introduction to R2 signaling
* Assumptions
* Description of the R2 package
* References
* Author's Address


4. Introduction to R2 signaling

Signaling System R2 is used as an international signaling system 
within international regions, for integrated international/national 
signaling and for both automatic and semiautomatic working. It 
allows for rapid call set-up and provides sufficient signals in both 
directions to permit the transmission of numerical and other 
information relating to the called and calling subscribers lines and 
to increase routing facilities. 

Line signaling uses an out-band low-level tone-on-idle 
signaling method for analogue working. For PCM operations, the tones 
are replaced by bit-codes. 

The inter-register signaling is a compelled multi-frequency code 
system. Inter-register signaling is performed end-to-end using a 2-
out-of-6 in-band multi frequency code with forward and backward 
compelled signaling. The register signaling is faster as there is no 
signal regeneration in intermediate exchanges. Overlap operation of 
address signaling makes it faster than MF-R1 or decadic. The 
following operational features are to name a few which are provided 
using multi-frequency code:

    - Calling party number identification
    - Calling party category identification
    - Nature of the circuit
    - Reason for Call failure
    - Language digits for international calls
    - Forward and backward signals for control of echo suppressers      

5. Assumptions

The following draft assumes the support of ITU-T compliant [4] 
compelled digital R2 signaling only. However there are as many 
variations in R2 signaling in terms of signal to frequency mapping 
and interpretation of each of these signals, as there are countries. 
It is therefore assumed that the MG is provisioned with the actual 
MF R2 signaling frequencies along with their amplitude, tone

duration and cadence and their interpretation. The line signaling 
patterns generated at the physical layer, is also assumed to be 
provisioned at the MG. The MG is expected to perform the compelling 
action with the help of some pre-provisioned logic to keep the 
MEGACO interface transparent of country dependant implementations. 
As mentioned earlier, the compelled address signaling sequence is 
executed at the MG. This is in accordance to MEGACO philosophy that 
the MG collects digits according to digit map and reports them to 
the MGC en-bloc. If the compelled signaling is done under 
supervision of the MGC then the call control at the MGC will become 
very complex. 

As R2 defines strict constraints on inter-register signal timing 
issues, any inter-event timer specified in the digitmaps for 
collecting the destination number shall be over-ruled by the 
protocol specific timers.

Country specific implementation of R2 signaling may also define new 
line and register signals not defined in the ITU-T version of R2 
signaling to incorporate features such as re-answering, trunk 
offering, re-ring, operator break-in etc. Such features shall be 
realized as new signals and events in country specific R2 packages 
that shall extend this basic R2 package.

This draft defines an ITU-T R2 specification [4] compliant "R2 
package" which is used to set up calls on R2 signaling trunks at one 
or both ends of the VoIP network. 

As the VoIP Gateway forms the inter-working unit between the PSTN 
and packet network both in terms of signaling and media, The MG 
shall either originate or terminate R2 signaling depending on 
whether it emulates the originating or incoming end in the signal 
path. It cannot act as a tandem unit for an end-to-end R2 signaling 
path.
