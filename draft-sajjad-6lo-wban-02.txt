1.  Introduction

   Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are comprised of devices that
   conform to the [IEEE802.15.6], standard by the IEEE.  IEEE 802.15.6
   provides specification for the MAC layer to access the channel.  The
   coordinator divides the channel into superframe time structures to

   allocate resources [SURVEY-WBAN] [MAC-WBAN].  Superframes are bounded
   by equal length beacons through the coordinator.  Usually beacons are
   sent at beacon periods except inactive superframes or limited by
   regulation.

   Task group for 802.15.6 was established by IEEE in November 2007 for
   standardisation of WBANs and it was approved in 2012.  This standard
   works in and around human body and focus on operating at lower
   frequencies and short range.  The focus of this document is to design
   a communication standard for MAC and physical layer to support
   different applications, namely, medical and no-medical applications.
   Medical applications refer to collection of vital information in real
   time (monitoring) for diagnoses and treatment of various diseases
   with help of different sensors (accelerometer, temperature, BP and
   EMG etc.).  It defines a MAC layer that can operate with three
   different PHY layers i.e. human body communication (HBC), ultra-
   wideband (UWB) and Narrowband (NB).  IEEE 802.15.6 provides
   specification for MAC layer to access the channel.  The coordinator
   divides the channel into superframe time structures to allocate
   resources.  Superframes are bounded by equal length beacons through
   coordinator.  The purpose of the draft is to highlight the need of
   IEEE 802.15.6 for WBASNs and its integration issues while connecting
   it with IPv6 network.  The use cases are provided to elaborate the
   scenarios with implantable and wearable biomedical sensors. 6lowpan
   provides IPv6 connectivity for IEEE 802.15.4; however, it does not
   work with IEEE 802.15.6 due to the difference in frame format in
   terms of size and composition.

1.1.  Frame Format and Addressing Modes

   Figure 1 shows the general MAC frame format consisting of a 56-bit
   header, variable length frame body, and 18-bit FrameCheck Sequence
   (FCS).  The maximum length of the frame body is 255 octets.  The MAC
   header further consists of 32-bit frame control, 8-bit recipient
   Identification (ID), 8-bit sender ID, and 8-bit WBAN ID fields.  The
   frame control field carries control information including the type of
   frame, that is, beacon, acknowledgement, or other control frames.
   The recipient and sender ID fields contain the address information of
   the recipient and the sender of the data frame, respectively.  The
   WBAN ID contains information on the WBAN in which the transmission is
   active.  The first 8-bit field in the MAC frame body carries message
   freshness information required for nonce construction and replay
   detection.  The frame payload field carries data frames, and the last
   32-bit Message Integrity Code (MIC) carries information about the
   authenticity and integrity of the frame.  The IEEE 802.15.6 standard
   supports two kinds of addresses:

   1.  8-bit short address, which is the sender ID.  This address is
       located in the MAC header used for communication.

   2.  48-bit EUI-48 address, which is used for the association process.
       For some certain frame types, e.g.  Security Association frames,
       this MAC address exists inside the MAC payload, for the node
       joining process.

1.2.  Why 6lo is required for IEEE 802.15.6

   Based on the characteristics defined in the overview section, the
   following sections elaborate on the main problems with IP for WBANs.

   The requirement for IPv6 connectivity within WBANs is driven by the
   following:

   o  The number of devices in WBANs makes network auto configuration
      and statelessness highly desirable.  And for this, IPv6 has
      (default auto-configuration as a) ready solutions.

   o  The large number of devices poses the need for a large address
      space, moreover a WBAN may consist of 256 nodes maximum and IPv6
      is helpful to solve this address space limitation.

   o  Given the limited packet size of WBANs, the IPv6 address format
      allows subsuming of IEEE 802.15.6 addresses if so desired.
      Applications within WBANs are expected to originate small packets.
      Adding all layers for IP connectivity should still allow
      transmission in one frame, without incurring excessive
      fragmentation and reassembly.  Furthermore, protocols must be

      designed or chosen so that the individual "control/protocol
      packets" fit within a single 802.15.6 frame.  Along these lines,
      IPv6's requirement of sub-IP reassembly may pose challenges for
      low-end WBANs healthcare devices that do not have enough RAM or
      storage for a 1280-octet packet [RFC2460].

   o  Simple interconnectivity to other IP networks including the
      Internet.

   o  However, given the limited packet size, headers for IPv6 and
      layers above must be compressed whenever possible.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Topology and Scope of Communication

   This is a standard for short-range, wireless communication in the
   vicinity of, or inside, a human body (but not limited to humans).  It
   uses existing industrial scientific medical (ISM) bands as well as
   frequency bands approved by national medical and/or regulatory
   authorities.  Support for quality of service (QoS), extremely low
   power, and data rates from 10Kbps to 10 Mbps is required while
   simultaneously complying with strict non-interference guidelines
   where needed.  The Table 1 shows a comparison of WBAN and other
   available technologies in terms of data rate and power consumption.

                        Table 1: Comparison of WBAN

   Data rates, typically up to 10Mbps, can be offered to satisfy an
   evolutionary set of entertainment and healthcare services.  Current
   personal area networks (PANs) do not meet the medical (proximity to
   human tissue) and relevant communication regulations for some
   application environments.  They also do not support the combination
   of reliability, QoS, low power, data rate, and non-interference
   required to broadly address the breadth of body area network (BAN)
   applications.

   The IEEE 802.15.6 working group has considered WBANs to operate in
   either a one-hop or two-hop star topology with the node in the centre
   of the star being placed on a location like the waist.  Two feasible
   types of data transmission exist in the one-hop star topology:
   transmission from the device to the coordinator and transmission from
   the coordinator to the device.  The communication methods that exist
   in the star topology are beacon mode and non-beacon mode.  In a two-
   hop start WBAN, a relay-capable node may be used to exchange data
   frames between a node and the hub.

   The IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.6 protocol stack is presented in Figure 2.
   It contains six elements from bottom to top including IEEE 802.15.6
   PHY layer, IEEE 802.15.6 MAC layer, Adaptation layer for IPv6 over

   adaptation layer supports the mechanisms like stateless address auto-
   configuration, header compression and fragmentation and reassembly.

5.  Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)

   The IPv6 packets have the MTU of 1280 octects and its expects from
   every link layer to send data by following this MTU or greater.  Thus
   maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of MAC layer describes the
   implementation of fragmentation and reassembly mechanism for the
   adaption IPv6 layer over IEEE 802.15.6.

   The IEEE 802.15.6 has the MTU of 256 octects, if we consider link
   layer security overhead (16 octects for AES-128) leaves 240 octects
   which is not sufficient to complete a IPv6 packet.Therefore, an
   adaption layer below IP layer is required to manage fragmentation and
   reassembly issues.

6.  Specification of IPv6 over WBAN

   Due to stringent QoS requirements in WBAN, a 6lo adaption layer is
   needed to support the transmission of IPv6 packets.6 LoWPAN standards
   [RFC4944], [RFC6775] and [RFC6282] provides useful information
   including link-local IPv6 address,stateless address auto-
   configuration, unicast and multicast address mapping,header
   compression and fragmentation and reassembly.  These standards are
   reffered in the specifications of 6lo adaptation layer which is
   illustrated in the following following subsections:

6.1.  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration

   This section defines how to obtain an IPv6 Interface Identifier.
   This specification distinguishes between two types of IIDs, MAC-
   address-derived and semantically opaque.

   IPv6 addresses may be autoconfigured from IIDs that may again be
   constructed from link-layer address information to save memory in
   devices and to facilitate efficient IP header compression as per
   [RFC6282].  The 64-bit IID for link-local address SHALL be derived by
   utilizing 8-bit node address and 8-bit BAN ID (part of MAC header) as
   follows:

   IID: 0x0000:00FF:FE00:YYXX

   Where YY is the BAN ID, XX is the node address.  As this generated
   IID is not golbally unique, the "Universal/Local" (U/L) bit (7th bit)
   SHALL be set to zero.  The use of BAN ID and node address guarantees
   the uniqueness of an IID inside a WBAN network.  Note that this MAC-
   address-derived IID varies when a node changes connection from one
   BAN coordinator to another.

   Considering the privacy issue mentioned in section 8, a semantically
   opaque IID having 64 bits of entropy is RECOMMENDED for each globally
   scoped address and MAY be locally generated according to the method
   introduced in [RFC7217]

6.2.  IPv6 Link-Local Address

   The IPv6 link-local address [RFC4291] for an IEEE 802.15.6 interface
   is generated by appending the interface identifier to the prefix
   FE80::/64.

       |1111111010|        (zeros)        |    Interface Identifier    |
       +----------+-----------------------+----------------------------+

6.3.  Unicast and Multicast Address Mapping

   The address resolution procedure for mapping IPv6 unicast addresses
   into IEEE 802.15.6 link-layer addresses follows the general
   description in section 7.2 of [RFC4861], unless otherwise specified.
   Multicast address mapping is not supported in IEEE 802.15.6.

6.4.  Header Compression

   The IEEE 802.15.6 PHY layer supports a maximum PSDU (PHY Service Data
   Unit) of 256 octets.  Because of the limited PHY payload, header
   compression at 6lo adaptation layer is of great importance and MUST
   be applied.  The compression of IPv6 datagrams within IEEE 802.15.6
   frames refers to [RFC6282], which updates [RFC4944].Multiple header
   compression stacks are defined in RFC6282 which specifies the
   fragmentation methods for IPv6 datagrams on top of IEEE
   802.15.4;however, for IEEE 802.15.6, a LoWPAN encapsulated LoWPAN_HC1
   compressed IPv6 datagram can be used as IEEE 802.15.6 does not
   require mesh header due to IEEE 802.15.6 communication
   scope.Moreover, static header compression techniques of [RFC7400] can
   also be used as header compression.

6.5.  Fragmentation and Reassembly

   IEEE 802.15.6 provides Fragmentation and reassembly (FAR) for payload
   of 256 bytes.  FAR as defined in [RFC4944], which specifies the
   fragmentation methods for IPv6 datagrams on top of IEEE 802.15.4 MUST
   be adapted to work with IEEE 802.15.6.  All headers MUST be
   compressed according to [RFC4944] encoding formats, but the default
   MTU of IEEE 802.15.6 is 256 bytes which MUST be considered.

7.  IANA Considerations

   [TBD]

8.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   IPv6 over WBAN's applications often require confidentiality and
   integrity protection.  This can be provided at the application,
   transport, network, and/or at the link.  IEEE 802.15.6 considers the
   security as a key requirement for healthcare applications and defines
   a complete framework.  This framework defines three levels of
   security which can be used according to requirements.  Overall, it
   covers privacy, confidentiality, encryption and authentication.
   AES-64 is preffered for encryption due to its efficiency.

   IP addresses may be used to track devices on the Internet; such
   devices can in turn be linked to individuals and their activities.
   Depending on the application and the actual use pattern, this may be
   undesirable.  To impede tracking, globally unique and non-changing
   characteristics of IP addresses should be avoided, e.g., by
   frequently changing the global prefix and avoiding unique link-layer-
   derived IIDs in addresses.  For this concern, a 64-bit semantically
   opaque IID is RECOMMENDED to be generated for global communication.
   The MAC-address-derived IID, when used for global communication,

   should be evaluated based on the using scenario in order to guarantee
   a short enough lifetime according to [RFC8065].

Appendix C.  Changes

   Compared with version-00, this updated draft is no longer all
   informative.  Two main changes have been made as below:

   1.  Introduction part of 802.15.6 is simplified and more focused on
       the features that relates to the 6lo-WBAN adaptation layer, e.g.
       MAC frame format including MAC address and MTU, topology and
       scope of communication, and why the 6lo-WBAN adaptation layer is
       needed.

   2.  The 6lo-WBAN adaptation layer is specified in this draft titled
       as "Specification of IPv6 over WBAN" that lists the main features
       needs to be added in the 6lo adaptation layer including the
       formation of IID, IPv6 link-local address, unicast address
       mapping, header compression, and fragmentation and reassembly.
       These parts have never been mentioned in other documents related
       to WBAN, and in this version, we provide a guidance for such IPv6
       enabled WBAN implementations.
