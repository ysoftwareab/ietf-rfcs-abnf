1.  Introduction

   This specification defines algorithm encodings and representations
   enabling the Standard Pairing Frinedly Curves to be used for JSON
   Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) [RFC7517] [RFC7517] and CBOR
   Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) [RFC8152] [RFC8152] messages.
   The elliptic curve and associated algorithm are registered in
   appropriate IANA JOSE and COSE registries.
