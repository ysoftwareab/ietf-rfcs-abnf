1.  Introduction


   This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for
   use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  The
   MIB module described in RFC 3276 [RFC3276] describes objects used for
   managing High Bit-Rate DSL - 2nd generation (HDSL2) [T1E1.4] and
   Single-Pair High-Speed Digital Subscriber Line (SHDSL) interfaces
   [G.991.2].  This document obsoletes RFC 3276 [RFC3276] which supports
   G.shdsl in that the MIB module described herein supports G.shdsl.bis
   as described in the G.991.2 [G.991.2].  In addition, objects have
   been added to improve the management of SHDSL lines.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework


   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].


   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Introduction


   This document describes an SNMP MIB for managing HDSL2/SHDSL Lines.
   These definitions are based upon the specifications for the HDSL2 and
   SHDSL Embedded Operations Channel (EOC) as defined in American
   National Standards Institute (ANSI) T1E1.4/2000-006 [T1E1.4] and
   International Telecommunication Union (ITU) G.991.2 [G.991.2].


   The MIB is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission, as
   discussed in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 3418 [RFC3418] and RFC 2863
   [RFC2863]) section of this document.


3.1  Relationship of the HDSL2/SHDSL Line MIB to other MIBs


   This section outlines the relationship of this MIB with other MIBs
   described in RFCs.  Specifically, IF-MIB as presented in RFC 2863
   [RFC2863] is discussed.




Sikes, et al.            Expires April 6, 2005                  [Page 3]
Internet-Draft                G.shdsl.bis                   October 2004



3.1.1  General IF-MIB Integration (RFC 2863)


   The HDSL2/SHDSL Line MIB specifies the detailed attributes of a data
   interface.  As such, it needs to integrate with RFC 2863 [RFC2863].
   The IANA has assigned the following ifTypes to HDSL2 and SHDSL:


      IANAifType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
          ...
      SYNTAX INTEGER {
          ...
          hdsl2 (168), -- High Bit-Rate DSL, 2nd generation
          shdsl (169), -- Multirate HDSL2
          ...
          }


   Note that the ifFixedLengthGroup from RFC 2863 [RFC2863] MUST be
   supported and that the ifRcvAddressGroup does not apply to this MIB.


3.1.2  Usage of ifTable


   The MIB branch identified by this ifType contains tables appropriate
   for this interface type.  Most such tables extend the ifEntry table,
   and are indexed by ifIndex.  For interfaces in systems implementing
   this MIB, those table entries indexed by ifIndex MUST be persistent.


   The following attributes are part of the mandatory ifGeneral group in
   RFC 2863 [RFC2863], and are not duplicated in the HDSL2/SHDSL Line
   MIB.

      ifDescr                  See interfaces MIB [RFC2863].


      ifType                   hdsl2(168) or shdsl(169).


      ifSpeed                  Set as appropriate.
                               (This is fixed at 1552000 for HDSL2
                               lines)


      ifPhysAddress            This object MUST have an octet string
                               with zero length.

      ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable   Default to enabled(1).


      ifHighSpeed              Set as appropriate.
                               (For HDSL2 lines, this is fixed at 2)


      ifConnectorPresent       Set as appropriate.

3.2  IANA Considerations


   The HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB module requires the allocation of a single
   object identifier for its MODULE-IDENTITY.  The IANA has allocated
   this object identifier in the transmission subtree (48), defined in
   the SNMPv2-SMI MIB module.


   The assignment was in fact done when RFC 3276 was published, and this
   revision of the RFC does not require any new action from IANA.

         xru1(3) .. xru8(10)    - regenerators, numbered from
                                  central office side


   o  Hdsl2ShdslUnitSide:


      Attributes with this syntax reference the two sides of a unit:


         networkSide(1)   - N in figure 2, below
         customerSide(2)  - C in figure 2, below


   o  Hdsl2ShdslWirePair:

   o  Hdsl2ShdslTransmissionModeType:


      Attributes with this syntax specify the regional setting for a
      SHDSL line.  Specified as a BITS construct, the two mode types
      are:


         region1   - ITU-T G.991.2 Annex A
         region2   - ITU-T G.991.2 Annex B

   current and 0 to 30 previous 1-day interval-counter(s).  Each current
   15-minute event bucket has an associated threshold notification.


   Unlike RFC 3593 [RFC3593] and RFC 2662 [RFC2662], there is no
   representation in the MIB for invalid buckets.  In those cases where
   the data for an interval is suspect or known to be invalid, the agent
   MUST NOT report the interval.  If the current 15-minute event bucket
   is determined to be invalid, notifications based upon the value of
   the event bucket MUST NOT be generated.


   Not reporting an interval will result in holes in the associated
   table.  For example, the table, hdsl2Shdsl15MinIntervalTable, is
   indexed by { ifIndex, hdsl2ShdslInvIndex, hdsl2ShdslEndpointSide,
   hdsl2ShdslEndpointWirePair, hdsl2Shdsl15MinIntervalNumber}.  If
   interval 12 is determined to be invalid but intervals 11 and 13 are
   valid, a Get Next operation on the indices .1.1.1.1.11 would return
   indices .1.1.1.1.13.


   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure a fixed relationship
   between the start of a fifteen minute interval and any wall clock;
   however some implementations may align the fifteen minute intervals
   with quarter hours.  Likewise, an implementation may choose to align
   one day intervals with the start of a day.


   Counters are not reset when an xU is reinitialized, only when the
   agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request outside
   the scope of this MIB).


4.5  Profiles


   As a managed node can handle a large number of xUs, (e.g., hundreds
   or perhaps thousands of lines), provisioning every parameter on every
   xU may become burdensome.  Moreover, most lines are provisioned
   identically with the same set of parameters.  To simplify the
   provisioning process, this MIB makes use of profiles.  A profile is a
   set of parameters that can be shared by multiple lines using the same
   configuration.


   The following profiles are used in this MIB:


   o  Span Configuration Profiles - Span configuration profiles contain
      parameters for configuring HDSL2/SHDSL spans.  They are defined in
      the hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfileTable.  Since span configuration
      parameters are only applicable for SHDSL, the support for span
      configuration profiles are optional for HDSL2 interfaces.


      Note that the configuration of the span dictates the behavior for




Sikes, et al.            Expires April 6, 2005                 [Page 11]
Internet-Draft                G.shdsl.bis                   October 2004



      each individual segment endpoint in the span.  If a different
      configuration is provisioned for any given segment endpoint within
      the span, the new configuration for this segment endpoint will
      override the span configuration for this segment endpoint only.


   o  Segment Endpoint Alarm Configuration Profiles - These profiles
      contain parameters for configuring alarm thresholds for HDSL2/
      SHDSL segment endpoints.  These profiles are defined in the
      hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable.


      The index value for this profile is a locally-unique
      administratively assigned name for the profile having the textual
      convention 'SnmpAdminString' (RFC 3411 [RFC3411]).


   One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single
   profile (e.g., hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile = 'silver') by
   setting its hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile objects to the value
   of this profile.  If a change is made to the profile, all lines that
   refer to it will be reconfigured to the changed parameters.  Before a
   profile can be deleted or taken out of service it must be first
   unreferenced from all associated lines.


   Implementations MUST provide a default profile whose name is 'DEFVAL'
   for each profile type.  The values of the associated parameters will
   be vendor specific unless otherwise indicated in this document.
   Before a line's profiles have been set, these profiles will be
   automatically used by setting hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile and
   hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfile to 'DEFVAL' where appropriate.  This
   default profile name, 'DEFVAL', is considered reserved in the context
   of profiles defined in this MIB.


   Profiles are created, assigned, and deleted dynamically using the
   profile name and profile row status in each of the four profile
   tables.


   Profile changes MUST take effect immediately.  These changes MAY
   result in a restart (hard reset or soft restart) of the units on the
   line.


4.6  Notifications


   The ability to generate the SNMP notifications coldStart/WarmStart
   (per [RFC3418]) which are per agent (e.g., per Digital Subscriber
   Line Access Multiplexer, or DSLAM, in such a device), and linkUp/
   linkDown (per [RFC2863]) which are per interface (i.e., HDSL2/SHDSL
   line) is required.


   A linkDown notification MAY be generated whenever any of ES, SES, CRC




Sikes, et al.            Expires April 6, 2005                 [Page 12]
Internet-Draft                G.shdsl.bis                   October 2004



   Anomaly, LOSW, or UAS event occurs.  The corresponding linkUp
   notification MAY be sent when all link failure conditions are
   cleared.


   The notifications defined in this MIB are for initialization failure
   and for the threshold crossings associated with the following events:
   ES, SES, CRC Anomaly, LOSW, and UAS.  Each threshold has its own
   enable/threshold value.  When that value is 0, the notification is
   disabled.


   The hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrStatus is a bitmask representing all
   outstanding error conditions associated with a particular Segment
   Endpoint.  Note that since status of remote endpoints is obtained via
   the EOC, this information may be unavailable for units that are
   unreachable via EOC during a line error condition.  Therefore, not
   all conditions may always be included in its current status.
   Notifications corresponding to the bit fields in this object are
   defined.


   Two alarm conditions, SNR Margin Alarm and Loop Attenuation Alarm,
   are organized in a manner slightly different from that implied in the
   EOC specifications.  In the MIB, these alarm conditions are tied to
   the two thresholds hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshSNRMargin and
   hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshLoopAttenuation found in the
   hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable.  In the EOC, the alarm
   conditions associated with these thresholds are per-unit.  In the
   MIB, these alarm conditions are per-endpoint.  For terminal units,
   this has no impact.  For repeaters, this implies an implementation
   variance where the agent in the terminal unit is responsible for
   detecting a threshold crossing.  As the reporting of a repeater
   detected alarm condition to the polling terminal unit occurs in the
   same EOC message as the reporting of the current SNR Margin and Loop
   Attenuation values, it is anticipated that this will have very little
   impact on agent implementation.


   A threshold notification occurs whenever the corresponding current
   15-minute interval error counter becomes equal to, or exceeds the
   threshold value.  One notification may be sent per interval per
   interface.  Since the current 15-minute counter is reset to 0 every
   15 minutes, and if the condition persists, the notification may recur
   as often as every 15 minutes.  For example, to get a notification
   whenever a "loss of" event occurs (but at most once every 15
   minutes), set the corresponding threshold to 1.  The agent will
   generate a notification when the event originally occurs.


   Note that the Network Management System, or NMS, may receive a
   linkDown notification, as well, if enabled (via
   ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable [RFC2863]).  At the beginning of the next 15




Sikes, et al.            Expires April 6, 2005                 [Page 13]
Internet-Draft                G.shdsl.bis                   October 2004



   minute interval, the counter is reset.  When the first second goes by
   and the event occurs, the current interval bucket will be 1, which
   equals the threshold, and the notification will be sent again.


   A hdsl2ShdslSpanInvalidNumRepeaters notification may be generated
   following completion of the discovery phase if the number of
   repeaters discovered on the line differs from the number of repeaters
   specified in hdsl2ShdslSpanConfNumRepeaters.  For those conditions
   where the number of provisioned repeaters is greater than those
   encountered during span discovery, all table entries associated with
   the nonexistent repeaters are to be discarded.  For those conditions
   where the number of provisioned repeaters is less than those
   encountered during span discovery, additional table entries are to be
   created using the default span configuration profile.


5.  Conformance and Compliance


   For both HDSL2 and SHDSL lines, the following group(s) are mandatory:

   DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module defines a collection of objects for managing
         HDSL2/SHDSL lines.  An agent may reside at either end of the
         line, however the MIB is designed to require no management
         communication between the modems beyond that inherent in the
         low-level EOC line protocol as defined in ANSI T1E1.4/2000-006
         (for HDSL2 lines), or in ITU G.991.2 (for SHDSL lines).

   REVISION    "200410060000Z" -- October 6, 2004
   DESCRIPTION "This version, published as RFC xxxx.
         The following changes have been made in this version:
           1.  Added a 3rd and 4th wire pair.
           2.  Modified all rates such that their rates are only
               constrained by an unsigned 32-bit value and not by
               what today's perceived technology limitations are.
           3.  Clarified that the rates from RFC 3276 include
               payload and any applicable framing and added
               objects for payload-only rates.
           4.  Added an object to indicate whether or not the
               tip and ring are reversed on a wire pair.
           5.  Added an object to display the activation state
               of a wire pair.
           6.  Added references as necessary for clarification.
           7.  Added display hints to textual conventions as
               necessary.
           8.  Updated conformance statements as necessary.
           9.  Some changes were due to IETF requirements and
               RFC generation tools."

7.  Implementation Analysis


   A management application which supports RFC 3276 could mistakenly
   flag a unit which responds with a rate or wire pair which exceeds the
   ranges and/or enumerations specified in RFC 3276.  For example, a
   G.shdsl.bis line with four wire pairs would report statistics for
   wire pairs that do not exist in RFC 3276.  That is, a GET-NEXT
   request issues with the object identifier:


      hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrAtn.1.1.1.2


   might return


      hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrAtn.1.1.1.3 = 0


   with a G.shdsl.bis unit and




Sikes, et al.            Expires April 6, 2005                 [Page 65]


      hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrSnrMgn.1.1.1.1 = 0


   with an HDSL2 unit as these objects are indexed by



      INDEX  { ifIndex, hdsl2ShdslInvIndex, hdsl2ShdslendpointSide,
               hdsl2ShdslEndpointWirePair }


   A management application intended to manage G.shdsl.bis agents,
   should be modified to accept this sequence.


   One should note that this same unmodified management application is
   still capable of managing G.shdsl.bis agents albeit to the degree of
   G.SHDSL (non-bis) limitations.  That is, it can create and monitor
   configurations limited to two wire pairs with an upper rate limit of
   4112000 bits/second.


8.  Security Considerations


   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module ( i.e., objects with
   a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive
   or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.


   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access the GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.


   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).


   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate




Sikes, et al.            Expires April 6, 2005                 [Page 66]
Internet-Draft                G.shdsl.bis                   October 2004



   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


   Blocking unauthorized access to the HDSL2-SHDSL MIB via the element
   management system is outside the scope of this document.  It should
   be noted that access to the MIB permits the unauthorized entity to
   modify the profiles such that both subscriber service and network
   operations can be interfered with.  Subscriber service can be altered
   by modifying any of a number of service characteristics such as rate
   partitioning and maximum transmission rates.  Network operations can
   be impacted by modification of notification thresholds such as SES
   thresholds.


   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may be
   considered to contain sensitive information.  Access to these objects
   would allow an intruder to obtain information about which vendor's
   equipment is in use on the network.  Further, such information is
   considered sensitive in many environments for competitive reasons.


   These identifying objects in the inventory group are:


   - hdsl2ShdslInvVendorID
   - hdsl2ShdslInvVendorModelNumber
   - hdsl2ShdslInvVendorSerialNumber
   - hdsl2ShdslInvVendorEOCSoftwareVersion
   - hdsl2ShdslInvStandardVersion
   - hdsl2ShdslInvVendorListNumber
   - hdsl2ShdslInvVendorIssueNumber
   - hdsl2ShdslInvVendorSoftwareVersion
   - hdsl2ShdslInvEquipmentCode
   - hdsl2ShdslInvVendorOther
   - hdsl2ShdslInvTransmissionModeCapability


   Therefore, it may be important in some environments to control read
   access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of
   these object when sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all
   versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.


   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 3414 [RFC3414] and the
   View-based Access Control Model RFC 3415 [RFC3415] are recommended.


   It is then the customer/user's responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.


   HDSL2-SHDSL layer connectivity from the xtuR will permit the




Sikes, et al.            Expires April 6, 2005                 [Page 67]
Internet-Draft                G.shdsl.bis                   October 2004



   subscriber to manipulate both the HDSL2-SHDSL link directly and the
   HDSL2-SHDSL embedded operations channel (EOC) for their own loop.
   For example, unchecked or unfiltered fluctuations initiated by the
   subscriber could generate sufficient notifications to potentially
   overwhelm either the management interface to the network or the
   element manager.


   It should be noted that interface indices in this MIB are maintained
   persistently.  View-based Access Control Model (VACM) data relating
   to these should be stored persistently.


   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.


   It is conceivable that a management application that was designed to
   support G.SHDSL as defined in RFC 3276 [RFC3276] could be broken by a
   G.shdsl.bis agent which reports objects for additional wire pairs (as
   noted in Section 7).


   For example, if a management application blindly loaded object
   instances into an array until the object changes (during repeated
   GET-NEXT requests).  It is anticipated that the modifications to the
   management application code would be straightforward.
