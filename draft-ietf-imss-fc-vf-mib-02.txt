  Internet Draft         Virtual Fabrics MIB               April 2006 
 
      

 1.      Introduction 

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information 
   Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the 
   Internet community. In particular, it describes managed 
   objects for information related to the Fibre Channel 
   network's Virtual Fabric function. 

 2.      The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the 
   current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer 
   to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].  Managed objects are 
   accessed via a virtual information store, termed the 
   Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol 
   (SNMP). 

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined 
   in the Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo 
   specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which 
   is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 
   [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 

 3.      Short Overview of Fibre Channel 

   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point-to-
   point serial data channel, structured for high performance. 
   Fibre Channel provides a general transport vehicle for higher 
   level protocols such as Small Computer System Interface 
   (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance Parallel Interface 
   (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and 
   others. 

   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple 
   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either 
   by a switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-
   point link. A Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more 
   N_Ports. A Fabric may consist of multiple Interconnect 
   Elements, some of which are switches. An N_Port connects to 
   the Fabric via a port on a switch called an F_Port. When 
   multiple FC nodes are connected to a single port on a switch 
   via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port is called 
   an FL_Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports. The 
   term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an 
   NL_Port. The term Fx_Port is used to refer to either an

  Internet Draft         Virtual Fabrics MIB               April 2006 
 
   F_Port or an FL_Port. A switch port, which is interconnected 
   to another switch port via an Inter-Switch Link (ISL), is 
   called an E_Port. A B_Port connects a bridge device with an 
   E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset of E_Port 
   functionality. 

   Many Fibre Channel components, including the Fabric, each 
   node, and most ports, have globally-unique names. These 
   globally-unique names are typically formatted as World Wide 
   Names (WWNs). More information on WWNs can be found in [FC-
   FS]. WWNs are expected to be persistent across agent and unit 
   resets. 

   Fibre Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers which 
   identify the frame's source and destination ports. Each FC 
   port has both an address identifier and a WWN. When a Fabric 
   is in use, the FC address identifiers are dynamic and are 
   assigned by a switch. Each octet of a 24-bit address 
   represents a level in an address hierarchy, with a Domain_ID 
   being the highest level of the hierarchy.  

   Virtual Fabrics allow a single physical Fabric to be divided 
   into multiple logical Fabrics.  Each Virtual Fabric may be 
   managed independently like traditional Fabrics.  Virtual 
   Fabrics are designed to achieve a better utilization of a 
   physical infrastructure and to isolate events in one Virtual 
   Fabric from affecting other Fabrics.  When one Core Switch 
   provides switching functions for multiple Virtual Fabrics, 
   that Core Switch is modeled as containing multiple Virtual 
   Switches, one for each Virtual Fabric. 

   Each Virtual Fabric is identified by a 12-bit Virtual Fabric 
   ID (VF_ID). When frames from multiple Virtual Fabrics are 
   transmitted over a physical link, the VF_ID carried in a 
   frame's Virtual Fabric Tagging Header (VFT_Header) identifies 
   which Virtual Fabric the frame belongs to.  The use of 
   VFT_Headers is enabled through an initial negotiation 
   exchange between the two connected ports.   

 4.      Relationship to Other MIBs 

   This MIB extends beyond [RFC4044] to cover the functionality, 
   in Fibre Channel switches, of providing Fibre Channel's 
   Virtual  

   Fabrics function.

 5.      MIB Overview 

   This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the 
   operation of, and configuring some parameters of, one or more 
   instances of Fibre Channel Virtual Fabric functionality. 
   (Note that there are no definitions in this MIB module of 
   "managed actions" which can be invoked via SNMP.) 

   The following MIB module has IMPORTS from [RFC2578], 
   [RFC2579], [RFC2580], [RFC2863], [RFC4044] and [FC-FAM-MIB]. 
   In REFERENCE clauses, it refers to [FC-SW-4]. 

 5.1     Fibre Channel management instance 

   A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [RFC4044] 
   as a separable managed instance of Fibre Channel 
   functionality. Fibre Channel functionality may be grouped 
   into Fibre Channel management instances in whatever way is 
   most convenient for the implementation(s). For example, one 
   such grouping accommodates a single SNMP agent having 
   multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with each sub-agent 
   implementing a different Fibre Channel management instance. 

   The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-
   MIB [RFC4044] as the index value to uniquely identify each 
   Fibre Channel management instance within the same SNMP 
   context ([RFC3411] section 3.3.1). The 
   t11vfVirtualSwitchTable augments the fcmSwitchTable, and the 
   primary index variable of the fcmSwitchTable is 
   fcmInstanceIndex.   

 5.2     Representing Core and Virtual Switches 

   In the presence of Virtual Switches, fcmSwitchTable in 
   RFC4044 contains a row for each Virtual Switch. 
   fcmSwitchTable, t11vfCoreSwitchTable and 
   t11vfVirtualSwitchTable are complementary. The 
   t11vfCoreSwitchTable and t11vfVirtualSwitchTable contain 
   information that helps the management client determine which 
   Switches are Virtual Switches and how each relates to a Core 
   Switch. A Virtual Switch must reside in a single Core Switch 
   and a Core Switch is defined as a set of entities with the 
   same Core Switch_Name.   

   RFC 4044 was defined before Virtual Switches were standard 
   and represented only physical Switches, so the RFC 4044 
   tables were not defined as read-create.  With the advent of 
   Virtual Switches, Virtual Switches can now be created by

   administrators and read-create tables are required. The 
   StorageType of RFC 4044 tables were not defined and 
   StorageTypes used in this MIB should also apply to the 
   RFC4044 tables that this MIB augments.

 7.      Security Considerations 

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB 
   module with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
   create.  Such objects may be considered sensitive or 
   vulnerable in some network environments.  The support for SET 
   operations in a non-secure environment without proper 
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  
   These are the tables and objects and their 
   sensitivity/vulnerability: 

   t11vfCoreSwitchMaxSupported, t11vfVirtualSwitchVfId, 

   t11vfCoreSwitchStorageType, t11vfVirtualSwitchStorageType 
   and t11vfVirtualSwitchRowStatus  

        - the ability to change the configuration of Virtual  
        Fabrics on a particular switch. 

   t11vfPortTaggingAdminStatus, t11vfLocallyEnabledRowStatus, 
   t11vfPortVfId, t11vfPortStorageType and  
   t11vfLocallyEnabledStorageType  

        - the ability to change the configuration of Virtual 
   Fabrics 
        on a port of a particular switch.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., 
   objects with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be 
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  It is thus important to control even GET 
   and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even 
   encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over 
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and 
   their sensitivity/vulnerability: 

   t11vfVirtualSwitchCoreSwitchName, t11vfPortTaggingOperStatus, 
   t11vfLocallyEnabledOperStatus,  

        - the ability to discover configuration of Virtual 
        Fabrics on 
        a virtual switch or a port. 

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate 
   security. Even if the network itself is secure (for example 
   by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on 
   the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
   (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module. 

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security 
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
   section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 
   cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy). 

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and 
   to enable cryptographic security.  It is then a 
   customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is 
   properly configured to give access to the objects only to 
   those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to 
   indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 

 8.      IANA Considerations 

   IANA is requested to make the OID assignment for the MIB 
   module under the appropriate subtree.
