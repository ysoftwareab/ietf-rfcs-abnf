                      draft-ietf-pce-pcep-yang-01

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model for the management of Path
   Computation Element communications Protocol (PCEP) for communications
   between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Computation
   Element (PCE), or between two PCEs.  The data model includes
   configuration data and state data (status information and counters
   for the collection of statistics).

1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655] is an entity
   that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
   network graph, and applying computational constraints.  A Path

   Computation Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be
   computed.

   PCEP is the communication protocol between a PCC and PCE and is
   defined in [RFC5440].  PCEP interactions include path computation
   requests and path computation replies as well as notifications of
   specific states related to the use of a PCE in the context of
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
   Traffic Engineering (TE).  [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] specifies
   extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of MPLS TE LSPs.

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] data model for the management
   of PCEP speakers.  It is important to establish a common data model
   for how PCEP speakers are identified, configured, and monitored.  The
   data model includes configuration data and state data (status
   information and counters for the collection of statistics).

   This document contains a specification of the PCEP YANG module,
   "ietf-pcep" which provides the PCEP [RFC5440] data model.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology and Notation

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC4655] and
   [RFC5440].  In particular, it uses the following acronyms.

   o  Path Computation Request message (PCReq).

   o  Path Computation Reply message (PCRep).

   o  Notification message (PCNtf).

   o  Error message (PCErr).

   o  Request Parameters object (RP).

   o  Synchronization Vector object (SVEC).

   o  Explicit Route object (ERO).

   This document also uses the following terms defined in [RFC7420]:

   o  PCEP entity: a local PCEP speaker.

   o  PCEP peer: to refer to a remote PCEP speaker.

   o  PCEP speaker: where it is not necessary to distinguish between
      local and remote.

   Further, this document also uses the following terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] :

   o  Stateful PCE, Passive Stateful PCE, Active Stateful PCE

   o  Delegation, Revocation, Redelegation

   o  LSP State Report, Path Computation Report message (PCRpt).

   o  LSP State Update, Path Computation Update message (PCUpd).

   [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] :

   o  PCE-initiated LSP, Path Computation LSP Initiate Message
      (PCInitiate).

   [I-D.ietf-pce-lsp-setup-type] :

   o  Path Setup Type (PST).

   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] :

   o  Segment Routing (SR).

3.1.  Tree Diagrams

   A graphical representation of the complete data tree is presented in
   Section 5.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows and as per [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc6087bis]:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

3.2.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are often used without a prefix, as long as it is clear from the
   context in which YANG module each name is defined.  Otherwise, names
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG module, as shown in Table 1.

     +-----------+-----------------+---------------------------------+
     | Prefix    | YANG module     | Reference                       |
     +-----------+-----------------+---------------------------------+

     | te        | ietf-te         | [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te]         |
     | te-types  | ietf-te-types   | [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te]         |
     | key-chain | ietf-key-chain  | [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-yang-key-chain] |

4.  Objectives

   This section describes some of the design objectives for the model:

   o  In case of existing implementations, it needs to map the data
      model defined in this document to their proprietary native data
      model.  To facilitate such mappings, the data model should be
      simple.

   o  The data model should be suitable for new implementations to use
      as is.

   o  Mapping to the PCEP MIB Module should be clear.

   o  The data model should allow for static configurations of peers.

   o  The data model should include read-only counters in order to
      gather statistics for sent and received PCEP messages, received
      messages with errors, and messages that could not be sent due to
      errors.

   o  It should be fairly straightforward to augment the base data model
      for advanced PCE features.

5.1.  The Entity

   The PCEP yang module may contain status information for the local
   PCEP entity.

   The entity has an IP address (using ietf-inet-types [RFC6991]) and a
   "role" leaf (the local entity PCEP role) as mandatory.

   Note that, the PCEP MIB module [RFC7420] uses an entity list and a
   system generated entity index as a primary index to the read only
   entity table.  If the device implements the PCEP MIB, the "index"
   leaf MUST contain the value of the corresponding pcePcepEntityIndex
   and only one entity is assumed.

5.2.  The Peer Lists

   The peer list contains peer(s) that the local PCEP entity knows
   about.  A PCEP speaker is identified by its IP address.  If there is
   a PCEP speaker in the network that uses multiple IP addresses then it
   looks like multiple distinct peers to the other PCEP speakers in the
   network.

   Since PCEP sessions can be ephemeral, the peer list tracks a peer
   even when no PCEP session currently exists to that peer.  The
   statistics contained are an aggregate of the statistics for all
   successive sessions to that peer.

   To limit the quantity of information that is stored, an
   implementation MAY choose to discard this information if and only if
   no PCEP session exists to the corresponding peer.

   The data model for PCEP peer presented in this document uses a flat
   list of peers.  Each peer in the list is identified by its IP address
   (addr-type, addr).

Internet-Draft                  PCE-YANG                    October 2016


   There is one list for static peer configuration ("/pcep/entity/
   peers"), and a separate list for the operational state of all peers
   (i.e.  static as well as discovered)("/pcep-state/entity/peers").
   The former is used to enable remote PCE configuration at PCC (or PCE)
   while the latter has the operational state of these peers as well as
   the remote PCE peer which were discovered and PCC peers that have
   initiated session.

5.3.  The Session Lists

   The session list contains PCEP session that the PCEP entity (PCE or
   PCC) is currently participating in.  The statistics in session are
   semantically different from those in peer since the former applies to
   the current session only, whereas the latter is the aggregate for all
   sessions that have existed to that peer.

   Although [RFC5440] forbids more than one active PCEP session between
   a given pair of PCEP entities at any given time, there is a window
   during session establishment where two sessions may exist for a given
   pair, one representing a session initiated by the local PCEP entity
   and the other representing a session initiated by the peer.  If
   either of these sessions reaches active state first, then the other
   is discarded.

   The data model for PCEP session presented in this document uses a
   flat list of sessions.  Each session in the list is identified by its
   initiator.  This index allows two sessions to exist transiently for a
   given peer, as discussed above.

   There is only one list for the operational state of all sessions
   ("/pcep-state/entity/peers/peer/sessions/session").

5.4.  Notifications

   This YANG model defines a list of notifications to inform client of
   important events detected during the protocol operation.  The
   notifications defined cover the PCEP MIB notifications.

6.  Advanced PCE Features

   This document contains a specification of the base PCEP YANG module,
   "ietf-pcep" which provides the basic PCEP [RFC5440] data model.

   This document further handles advanced PCE features like -

   o  Capability and Scope

   o  Domain information (local/neighbour)

   o  Path-Key

   o  OF

   o  GCO

   o  P2MP

   o  GMPLS

   o  Inter-Layer

   o  Stateful PCE

   o  Segement Routing

   o  Authentication including PCEPS (TLS)

   [Editor's Note - Some of them would be added in a future revision.]

6.1.  Stateful PCE's LSP-DB

   In the operational state of PCEP which supports stateful PCE mode,
   the list of LSP state are maintained in LSP-DB.  The key is the PLSP-
   ID and the PCC IP address.

   The PCEP data model contains the operational state of LSPs (/pcep-
   state/entity/lsp-db/lsp/) with PCEP specific attributes.  The generic
   TE attributes of the LSP are defined in [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te].  A
   reference to LSP state in TE model is maintained.

7.  Open Issues and Next Step

   This section is added so that open issues can be tracked.  This
   section would be removed when the document is ready for publication.

7.1.  The PCE-Initiated LSP

   The TE Model at [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] should support creationg of
   tunnels at the controller (PCE) and marking them as PCE-Initiated.
   The LSP-DB in the PCEP Yang (/pcep-state/entity/lsp-db/lsp/
   initiation) also marks the LSPs which are PCE-initiated.

7.2.  PCEP over TLS (PCEPS)

   A future version of this document would add TLS related
   configurations.

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control model
   [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for particular
   NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF
   protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., <edit-config>)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   TBD: List specific Subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability.

10.  Manageability Considerations

10.1.  Control of Function and Policy

10.2.  Information and Data Models

10.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

10.4.  Verify Correct Operations

10.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

10.6.  Impact On Network Operations

11.  IANA Considerations
