Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
   In particular, it defines a MIB module for managing the Rapid
   Spanning Tree capability defined by the IEEE P802.1t [802.1t] and
   P802.1w [802.1w] amendments to IEEE Std 802.1D-1998 for bridging
   between Local Area Network (LAN) segments.

   Provisions are made for support of transparent bridging.  Provisions
   are also made so that these objects apply to bridges connected by
   subnetworks other than LAN segments.  This memo also includes a MIB
   module in a manner that is compliant to SMIv2 [RFC2578].

   This memo supplements RFC 1493 [RFC1493] and RFC 2674 [RFC2674].

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


2.  Overview

   A common device present in many networks is the Bridge.  This device
   is used to connect Local Area Network segments below the network
   layer.  These devices are often known as 'layer 2 switches'.

   There are two major modes defined for this bridging: Source-Route and
   transparent.  Source-Route bridging is described by IEEE 802.5
   [802.5] and is not discussed further in this document.

   The transparent method of bridging is defined by IEEE 802.1D-1998
   [802.1D]  Managed objects for that original specification of
   transparent bridging were defined in RFC 1493 [RFC1493].


2.1.  Scope

   This MIB includes a comprehensive set of managed objects which
   attempts to match the set defined in IEEE P802.1t [802.1t] and
   P802.1w [802.1w].


3.  Structure of MIBs

   This document defines additional managed objects for Rapid Spanning
   Tree Protocol defined by IEEE P802.1t and IEEE P802.1w, on top of
   those existing in the original BRIDGE-MIB module defined in
   [RFC1493]: that MIB module is to be maintained unchanged for
   backwards compatibility.  Section 3.4.1 of the present document
   contains some recommendations regarding usage of objects in the

   original bridge MIB by devices implementing the enhancements defined
   here.



3.1.  Structure of RSTP-MIB

   Objects in this MIB are defined as an addition to the dot1dStp group
   in the original bridge MIB [RFC1493].  The overall structure is
   shown below:

   Bridge MIB Name                       IEEE 802.1 Reference

   dot1dStp
     dot1dStpVersion                   (w) 17.16.1  ForceVersion
     dot1dStpTxHoldCount               (w) 17.16.6  TxHoldCount
     dot1dStpPathCostDefault
     dot1dStpExtPortTable
       dot1dStpPortProtocolMigration   (w) 17.18.10 mcheck
       dot1dStpPortAdminEdgePort       (t) 18.3.3   adminEdgePort
       dot1dStpPortOperEdgePort        (t) 18.3.4   operEdgePort
       dot1dStpPortAdminPointToPoint   (w) 6.4.3    adminPointToPointMAC
       dot1dStpPortOperPointToPoint    (w) 6.4.3    operPointToPointMAC
       dot1dStpPortAdminPathCost       (D) 8.5.5.3  Path Cost


3.2.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   As described above, some IEEE 802.1D management objects have not been
   included in this MIB because they overlap with objects in other MIBs
   applicable to a bridge implementing this MIB.  In particular, it is
   assumed that a bridge implementing this MIB will implement the
   original bridge MIB [RFC1493].


3.2.1.  Relation to Original Bridge MIB

   This section defines how objects in the original bridge MIB module
   [RFC1493] should be represented for devices which implement all the
   MIB modules described in this memo.  Some of the old objects are less
   useful in such devices but must still be implemented for reasons of
   backwards compatibility.

Internet Draft             RSTP (802.1w) MIBs             September 2004


3.2.1.1.  The dot1dBase Group

   This mandatory group contains the objects which are applicable to all
   types of bridges.  Interpretation of this group is unchanged.


3.2.1.2.  The dot1dStp Group

   This group contains the objects that denote the bridge's state with
   respect to the Spanning Tree Protocol.  If a node does not implement
   the Spanning Tree Protocol, this group will not be implemented.

   In a device supporting the Spanning Tree Algorithm and Protocol
   defined in IEEE 802.1D-1998 Clause 8, interpretation of this group is
   unchanged.

   In a device supporting the Rapid Spanning Tree Algorithm and Protocol
   defined in IEEE 802.1w Clause 17, the interpretation of objects in
   this group is unchanged except for those listed below:

   dot1dStpPriority
        Definition remains unchanged, but the permissible values are
        changed to 0-61440, in steps of 4096.

   dot1dStpPortPriority
        Definition remains unchanged, but the permissible values are
        changed to 0-240, in steps of 16.

   dot1dStpTimeSinceTopologyChange
        The time since the tcWhile timer for any port on this Bridge was
        non-zero.

   dot1dStpTopChanges
        The number of times that there have been at least one non-zero
        tcWhile timer on this Bridge.

   In a device supporting the 32-bit default Path Costs defined in IEEE
   802.1t Table 8-5, the object dot1dStpPortPathCost32 [RFC1493] should
   be used rather than the older object dot1dStpPortPathCost. The newer
   object supports the expanded range of 1-200,000,000.

3.2.1.3.  The dot1dTp Group

   This group contains objects that describe the entity's state with
   respect to transparent bridging.  Interpretation for this group is
   unchanged.


3.2.1.4.  The dot1dStatic Group

   This group contains objects that describe the entity's state with
   respect to destination-address filtering.  Interpretation for this
   group is unchanged.

5.  Acknowledgments

   This document was produced on behalf of the Bridge MIB Working Group
   in the Operations and Management area of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force.

   The authors wish to thank the members of the Bridge MIB Working
   Group, especially Alex Ruzin, for their comments and suggestions
   which improved this effort.


6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model [USM] and the View-based Access
   Control Model [VACM] is recommended.
