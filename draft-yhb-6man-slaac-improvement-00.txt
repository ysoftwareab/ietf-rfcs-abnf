Abstract

   IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration described by RFC4862 only 
   supports 64-bit prefixes. This approach can't be deployed in the 
   sites with prefixes longer than 64. We have no right to require that 
   the sites MUST use 64-bit prefixes. This document tries to implement
   stateless address autoconfiguration with prefixes longer than 64.

1.  Introduction                                                         	
                                                                         	
   The IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration described by RFC4862 
   requires no manual configuration of hosts and no additional servers,
   so it is welcomed by a lot of users. But it has a detect that some
   users complain about:
   
   The sum of the prefix length and interface identifier length MUST 
   equal 128 bits. RFC4291 specifies that for all unicast addresses, 
   except those that start with the binary value 000, Interface IDs are 
   required to be 64 bits long. It means the prefix length MUST be 64, 
   and this approach can't be deployed in the sites with prefixes longer
   than 64.

   A 64-bit prefix can generate at most 2^64 IPv6 addresses. In fact,
   any LAN can't run out of so many IPv6 addresses, and only a very 
   small part of IPv6 addresses are used, so it is a serious waste. Some 
   sites do not need 64-bit prefixes. We have no right to require  
   that the sites MUST use 64-bit prefixes.
   
   If the prefix of the site is longer than 64, or if the prefix is 64 
   bits long, and the site is divided into several subnets, then the 
   stateless address autoconfiguration cannot be used and the 
   convenience it will bring cannot be shared.

   So we scream for stateless address autoconfiguration with prefixes 
   longer than 64.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
   
2.  Protocol Specification
	  	  
2.1.  Router Advertisement Processing

   When a host receives a valid router advertisement, execute the 
   following steps for each Prefix-Information option in the router 
   advertisement:
	  
   (1)  If the Autonomous flag is not set, silently ignore the Prefix
   Information option.

Internet-Draft  IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration   February 2011

   (2)  If the prefix is a link-local prefix, silently ignore the
   Prefix Information option.

   (3)  If the preferred lifetime is greater than the valid lifetime,
   silently ignore the Prefix Information option.  A node MAY wish to
   log a system management error in this case.
      
   (4) If the prefix length is less than (128 - length of interface ID)
   or more than 126, the Prefix Information option MUST be ignored. An
   implementation MAY wish to log a system management error in this 
   case.

   (5) If the prefix advertised overlaps with the prefix of an  
   address configured by stateless autoconfiguration already in the  
   list of addresses associated with the interface, and the former is 
   not equal to the latter, the Prefix Information option MUST be 
   ignored. An implementation MAY wish to log a system management error  
   in this case.     

   (6) If the receiving interface is not ISATAP tunnel interface, the 
   Valid Lifetime is not 0, host ID is configured (the host ID greater 
   than 0 and less than 2 ^ (128 - prefix length) is valid), an address
   is formed by combining the advertised prefix with the host ID as 
   follows:
	    
      |                N bits                 |      128 - N bits      |
      +---------------------------------------+------------------------+
      |            link prefix                |        host ID         |
      +----------------------------------------------------------------+	    
	    
   A host MUST allow the host ID to be configured by system management.
	  
   If the host ID configured on the host is invalid, an address can't 
   be formed. A node MUST log a system management error in this case.
	        	  
   (7) If the receiving interface is Ethernet, and the Valid Lifetime 
   is not 0, do with the Prefix-Information option as follows: 
	  
   (7.1) If the prefix length is 64, an address is formed by combining 
   the advertised prefix with the interface identifier.

   (7.2)If the prefix length is greater than 64 and is not greater than
   80, an address is formed by combining the advertised prefix with 
   the MAC address of the interface as follows:

      |            N bits            | (80 - N) bits |     48 bits     |
      +------------------------------+---------------+-----------------+
      |            link prefix       |   reserved    |   MAC address   |
      +----------------------------------------------------------------+
      
   The middle (80 - N) bits are reserved for future use, now it MUST be 
   zero.

   (7.3) If the prefix length is greater than 80, a random number 
   between 0 and 2 ^ (128 - prefix length) is generated, and an address
   is formed by combining the advertised prefix with the random number
   as follows:
	    
      |                N bits                 |       128 - N bits     |
      +---------------------------------------+------------------------+
      |            link prefix                |     random number      |
      +----------------------------------------------------------------+		    
	    
   (8) If the receiving interface is not Ethernet, execute step d in 
   section 5.5.3 of RFC4862.
    
   (9) If the advertised prefix is equal to the prefix of an address
   configured by stateless autoconfiguration in the list, execute step 
   e in section 5.5.3 of RFC4862.

2.2.  ISATAP Tunnel

   Besides Ethernet, stateless address autoconfiguration is often used 
   on an ISATAP tunnel. But, it is a pity that the ISATAP tunnel can't 
   support stateless address autoconfiguration with prefixes longer 
   than 64 because of ISATAP interface identifier. 
	  
2.3.  Analysis of Duplicate Address Possibility

   On the Ethernet, if the prefix length is not less than 64 and not 
   greater than 80,use the MAC address to form the IPv6 address. The 
   possibility that the IPv6 address is duplicate is very low, because 
   the possibility that the MAC address is duplicate is very low.
    
   If the prefix length is greater than 80, it is more convenient for 
   users to use the random number to form the IPv6 address, but the 
   IPv6 address is possibly duplicate. Suppose there are M hosts on the
   link,the prefix length is N, if all hosts run stateless address 
   autoconfiguration almost at the same time, for each host, duplicate  
   address possibility P is (M-1)/(2^(128-N)-1). In order to ensure 
   each host runs stateless address autoconfiguration successfully, P 
   SHOULD be less than 1/1000. For example, there are 1000 hosts on the
   link, if it is required that P should be less than 1/1000, N should 
   be less than 108.If stateless address autoconfiguration fails for 
   the first time, it is a good idea to try more times.

   Another choice is that the network administrator assigns host IDs to 
   each host. The first benefit is that the IPv6 addresses can be fully 
   used, for example, on the link with 1000 hosts, the 118-bit prefix  
   is enough. The second benefit is that duplicate address possibility 
   is very low, almost zero.
