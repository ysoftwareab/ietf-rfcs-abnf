   As of this writing, many efforts aimed at streamlining various IETF
   processes are underway. One such effort is the Process and Tools, or
   PROTO Team. The PROTO Team is an IESG-driven activity focused  on
   improving the work flow of approval of documents, and the tools that
   support this work flow. This document describes a pilot process
   designed by the PROTO Team to streamline document flow by allowing
   working group chairs to coordinate the resolution of IESG DISCUSS
   comments.

1.  Introduction


   As part of the ongoing effort to streamline various IETF processes,
   the PROTO team [PROTO] has designed a set of pilot projects to test
   possible changes to current document flow processing.  This document
   describes a pilot project designed to allow working group chairs to
   follow up on IESG DISCUSS [IDTRACKER] comments, and thereby offload
   that function from shepherding Area Director (AD) and improve process
   efficiency.  Finally, [KLENSIN] describes the rationale for
   supporting piloting of process changes.



2.  Pilot Description


   This pilot is designed to allow a working group chair to follow up on
   and resolve the DISCUSS comments for a given internet draft, and by
   doing so increase the efficiency of the IETF document process flow.
   The next section defines the terminology used throughout the
   document, and remainder of the document describes the details of the
   pilot.



3.  Definitions




3.1.  Shepherding


   [MANKIN] defines the basic concept of document shepherding as

      "...a single person (an AD currently) to take responsibility
      for a document from the time the WG Chair(s) requests the IESG
      to publish it to the time that it is given final edits by the
      RFC Editor. The motivation is for the shepherd to provide
      needed coordination."



3.2.  Shepherding Working Group Chair (SWGC)


   The Shepherding Working Group Chair, or SWGC, is a working group



Meyer, D.                                         Section 3.2.  [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004


   chair that has been selected by the appropriate AD(s) to participate
   in the pilot described in this document. Note that the Working Group
   Secretary (if such exists) may also serve as the SWGC.



3.3.  Pilot Internet Draft (PID)


   The Pilot Internet Draft, or PID, is an Internet draft which a
   shepherding working group chair takes through the post-working group
   last call stages of the approval and publication process.  The
   approval of the responsible Area Director is necessary to make an
   Internet draft part of the pilot.



3.4.  Responsible AD


   The responsible AD is the Area Director who is responsible for the
   draft.



3.5.  DISCUSSing AD


   The DISCUSSing AD is the Area Director who has raised the DISCUSS
   comments (as documented in the ID Tracker).

6.  Pilot Process -- Details



   In this section we detail the steps that a SWGC will take in
   resolving the DISCUSS items against a given PID. The steps are given
   below, in the order that they are to be executed.

    (i).    Immediately after the weekly IESG conference call, the
            SWGC queries the ID tracker [IDTRACKER] to collect any
            DISCUSS comments raised against the PID. In order to
            accomplish this, the SWGC's email address must be added
            to the "State Change Notice To:" field in the ID tracker.
            This will result in an email to the SWGC when the
            document is moved from the "IESG Evaluation" state to
            the "IESG Evaluation/New ID Needed state", which occurs
            after the IESG teleconference. This notification indicates
            to the the SWGC that the DISCUSS comments have been
            registered.

            Note that there may be exceptional cases when DISCUSS
            comments are registered after the IESG teleconference.
            In these cases, the DISCUSSing AD should notify the SWGC
            that new comments have been entered.

    (ii).   The SWGC analyzes comments from the tracker, and
            initializes contact with any AD's who have placed
            comments (blocking or non-blocking) on a draft,
            notifying them that the SWGC is the current document
            shepherd and seeking any additional clarification
            necessary to understand the comment. Note that the
            responsible AD must copied on this correspondence.

            +------+  Comments     +--------+  Comments      +-------+
            | (i)  |-------------> |  (ii)  | -------------> | (iii) |
            +------+  Collected    +--------+  Understood    +-------+
                                    /|\   |
                                     |    | Comments not fully understood
                                     |    | (Further AD/SWGC Discussion
                                     |    |  Required)
                                     +----+

    (iii).  The SWGC then coordinates DISCUSS comments, and builds a
            a consistent interpretation of the comments. This step
            may require iteration with step (ii). above. That is:






Meyer, D.                                           Section 6.  [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: November 2004                 May 2004


            +------+   Consistent     +-------+
            | (ii) |----------------> | (iii) |
            +------+ Interpretation   +-------+
              /|\                         |
               |                          | Further AD/SWGC Discussion
               |                          | Required
               +--------------------------+


    (iv).   The DISCUSS comments are then communicated to the
            working group.

    (v).    After the author(s) resolve the issues provided by the
            SWGC (i.e., the distilled DISCUSS issues), the SWGC
            reviews the updated document to ensure that (in her/his
            option) the DISCUSS issues have been resolved.

            Note that the SWGC may also propose resolutions to these
            issues, file them in an issue tracker, or do other steps
            to streamline the resolution of the comments.

    (vi).   The SWGC communicates the resolution-so-far to the
            responsible AD and the DISCUSSing AD(s).

    (vii).  DISCUSSing AD removes DISCUSS comment, or tells the WG
            why the comment is not resolved.

            If the DISCUSS comment in question was not resolved to
            the satisfaction of the DISCUSSing and responsible ADs,
            two possibilities exist:

            (a). The process returns to step (iii), or

            (b). The working group can appeal in accordance with the
                 procedures described in RFC 2418 [RFC2418].

            Otherwise, the process continues with step (viii).

    (viii). The responsible AD moves document to APPROVED state, or
            sends it back to the IESG for re-review (if the changes
            are deemed significant).
