1.  Introduction

   [RFC7315] defines the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] P-
   Access-Network-Info header field.

   The header field syntax contains an 'access-info' header field
   parameter, with a set of pre-defined values.  Most pre-defined values
   follow the 'generic-param' rule [RFC3261].  However, currently the
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] requires new values are
   required to follow the 'gen-value' rule [RFC3261], which is more
   restrictive than 'generic-param'.  There is no justification for the
   restriction, and new values have already been defined following the
   'generic-param' rule.

   This document updates section 5.4 of [RFC7315], by modifying the
   extension-access-info part of the P-Access-Network-Info header field
   ABNF.

   As the P-Access-Network-Info header field is mainly used in networks
   defined by the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), where new
   values following the 'generic-param' rule have been followed, the
   update is not seen to cause backward compatibility concerns.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Update to RFC 7315

   This section updates the ABNF defined in section 5.4 of RFC 7315, as
   described below:

   Old syntax:

       extension-access-info  = gen-value


   New syntax:

       extension-access-info  = generic-param


4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the P-Access-Network-Info header
   field are defined in [RFC7315].  The ABNF update defined in this
   document does not impact the security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests from IANA.

6.  Acknowledgments

   TBD
