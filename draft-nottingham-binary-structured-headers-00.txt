                     Binary Structured HTTP Headers
             draft-nottingham-binary-structured-headers-00

Abstract

   This specification defines a binary serialisation of Structured
   Headers for HTTP, along with a negotiation mechanism for its use in
   HTTP/2.  It also defines how to use Structured Headers for many
   existing headers - thereby "backporting" them - when supported by two
   peers.

Internet-Draft       Binary Structured HTTP Headers        November 2019


1.  Introduction

   HTTP messages often pass through several systems - clients,
   intermediaries, servers, and subsystems of each - that parse and
   process their header and trailer fields.  This repeated parsing (and
   often re-serialisation) adds latency and consumes CPU, energy, and
   other resources.

   Structured Headers for HTTP [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]
   offers a set of data types that new headers can combine to express
   their semantics.  This specification defines a binary serialisation
   of those structures in Section 2, and specifies its use in HTTP/2 -
   specifically, as part of HPACK Literal Header Field Representations
   ([RFC7541]) - in Section 3.

   Section 4 defines how to use Structured Headers for many existing
   headers when supported by two peers.

   The primary goal of this specification are to reduce parsing overhead
   and associated costs, as compared to the textual representation of
   Structured Headers.  A secondary goal is a more compact wire format
   in common situations.  An additional goal is to enable future work on
   more granular header compression mechanisms.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Binary Structured Headers

   This section defines a binary serialisation for the Structured Header
   Types defined in [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure].

   The types permissable as the top-level of Structured Header field
   values - Dictionary, List, and Item - are defined in terms of a
   Binary Literal Representation (Section 2.1), which is a replacement
   for the String Literal Representation in [RFC7541].

   Binary representations of the remaining types are defined in
   Section 2.2.

2.1.  The Binary Literal Representation

   The Binary Literal Representation is a replacement for the String
   Literal Representation defined in [RFC7541], Section 5.2, for use in
   BINHEADERS frames (Section 3.2).

     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   |   Type (4)    | PLength (4+)  |
   +---+---------------------------+
   | Payload Data (Length octets)  |
   +-------------------------------+

   A binary literal representation contains the following fields:

   o  Type: Four bits indicating the type of the payload.

   o  PLength: The number of octets used to represent the payload,
      encoded as per [RFC7541], Section 5.1, with a 4-bit prefix.

   o  Payload Data: The payload, as per below.

   The following payload types are defined:

2.1.1.  Lists

   List values (type=0x1) have a payload consisting of a stream of
   Binary Structured Types representing the members of the list.
   Members that are Items are represented as per Section 2.2.3; members
   that are inner-lists are represented as per Section 2.2.1.

   If any member cannot be represented, the entire field value MUST be
   serialised as a String Literal (Section 2.1.4).

2.1.2.  Dictionaries

   Dictionary values (type=0x2) have a payload consisting of a stream of
   members.

   Each member is represented by a key length, followed by that many
   bytes of the member-name, followed by Binary Structured Types
   representing the member-value.

   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---
   | member-value
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---

   A parameter's fields are:

   o  KL: The number of octets used to represent the member-name,
      encoded as per [RFC7541], Section 5.1, with a 8-bit prefix

   o  member-name: KL octets of the member-name

   o  member-value: One or more Binary Structure Types

   member-values that are Items are represented as per Section 2.2.3;
   member-values that are inner-lists are represented as per
   Section 2.2.1.

   If any member cannot be represented, the entire field value MUST be
   serialised as a String Literal (Section 2.1.4).

2.1.3.  Items

   Item values (type=0x3) have a payload consisting of Binary Structured
   Types, as described in Section 2.2.3.

2.1.4.  String Literals

   String Literals (type=0x4) are the string value of a header field;
   they are used to carry header field values that are not Binary
   Structured Headers, and may not be Structured Headers at all.  As
   such, their semantics are that of String Literal Representations in
   [RFC7541], Section 5.2.

   Their payload is the octets of the field value.

2.2.  Binary Structured Types

   Every Binary Structured Type starts with a 5-bit type field that
   identifies the format of its payload:

         Type (5)      |  Payload...
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---

   Some Binary Structured Types contain padding bits; senders MUST set
   padding bits to 0; recipients MUST ignore their values.

2.2.1.  Inner Lists

   The Inner List data type (type=0x1) has a payload in the format:

     5   6   7   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---
        L(3+)  |  Members (L octets)
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---

   Its fields are:

   o  L: The number of octets used to represent the members, encoded as
      per [RFC7541], Section 5.1, with a 3-bit prefix

   o  Members: L octets

   Each member of the list will be represented as an Item
   (Section 2.2.3); if any member cannot, the entire field value will be
   serialised as a String Literal (Section 2.1.4).

   The inner list's parameters, if present, are serialised in a
   following Parameter type (Section 2.2.2); they do not form part of
   the payload of the inner list.

2.2.2.  Parameters

   The Parameters data type (type=0x2) has a payload in the format:

     5   6   7   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7

   A parameter's fields are:

   o  KL: The number of octets used to represent the parameter-name,
      encoded as per [RFC7541], Section 5.1, with a 8-bit prefix

   o  parameter-name: KL octets of the parameter-name

   o  parameter-value: A Binary Structured type representing a bare item
      (Section 2.2.3)

   Parameter-values are bare items; that is, they MUST NOT have
   parameters themselves.

   If the parameters cannot be represented, the entire field value will
   be serialised as a String Literal (Section 2.1.4).

   Parameters are always associated with the Binary Structured Type that
   immediately preceded them.  If parameters are not explicitly allowed
   on the preceding type, or there is no preceding type, it is an error.

2.2.3.  Item Payload Types

   Individual Structured Header Items can be represented using the
   Binary Payload Types defined below.

   The item's parameters, if present, are serialised in a following
   Parameter type (Section 2.2.2); they do not form part of the payload
   of the item.

   padding.

3.  Using Binary Structured Headers in HTTP/2

   When both peers on a connection support this specification, they can
   take advantage of that knowledge to serialise headers that they know
   to be Structured Headers (or compatible with them; see Section 4).

   Peers advertise and discover this support using a HTTP/2 setting
   defined in Section 3.1, and convey Binary Structured Headers in a
   frame type defined in Section 3.2.

Internet-Draft       Binary Structured HTTP Headers        November 2019


3.1.  Binary Structured Headers Setting

   Advertising support for Binary Structured Headers is accomplished
   using a HTTP/2 setting, SETTINGS_BINARY_STRUCTURED_HEADERS (0xTODO).

   Receiving SETTINGS_BINARY_STRUCTURED_HEADERS from a peer indicates
   that:

   1.  The peer supports the Binary Structured Types defined in
       Section 2.

   2.  The peer will process the BINHEADERS frames as defined in
       Section 3.2.

   3.  When a downstream consumer does not likewise support that
       encoding, the peer will transform them into HEADERS frames (if
       the peer is HTTP/2) or a form it will understand (e.g., the
       textual representation of Structured Headers data types defined
       in [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]).

   4.  The peer will likewise transform all fields defined as Aliased
       Fields (Section 4.2) into their non-aliased forms as necessary.

   The default value of SETTINGS_BINARY_STRUCTURED_HEADERS is 0.  Future
   extensions to Structured Headers might use it to indicate support for
   new types.

3.2.  The BINHEADERS Frame

   When a peer has indicated that it supports this specification
   {#setting}, a sender can send the BINHEADERS Frame Type (0xTODO).

   The BINHEADERS Frame Type behaves and is represented exactly as a
   HEADERS Frame type ([RFC7540], Section 6.2), with one exception;
   instead of using the String Literal Representation defined in
   [RFC7541], Section 5.2, it uses the Binary Literal Representation
   defined in Section 2.1.

   Fields that are Structured Headers can have their values represented
   using the Binary Literal Representation corresponding to that
   header's top-level type - List, Dictionary, or Item; their values
   will then be serialised as a stream of Binary Structured Types.

   Additionally, any field (including those defined as Structured
   Headers) can be serialised as a String Literal (Section 2.1.4), which
   accommodates headers that are not defined as Structured Headers, not
   valid Structured Headers, or that the sending implementation does not
   wish to send as Binary Structured Types for some other reason.

   Note that Field Names are always serialised as String Literals
   (Section 2.1.4).

   This means that a BINHEADERS frame can be converted to a HEADERS
   frame by converting the field values to the string representations of
   the various Structured Headers Types, and String Literals
   (Section 2.1.4) to their string counterparts.

   Conversely, a HEADERS frame can be converted to a BINHEADERS frame by
   encoding all of the Literal field values as Binary Structured Types.
   In this case, the header types used are informed by the
   implementations knowledge of the individual header field semantics;
   see Section 4.  Those which it cannot (do to either lack of knowledge
   or an error) or does not wish to convert into Structured Headers are
   conveyed in BINHEADERS as String Literals (Section 2.1.4).

   Field values are stored in the HPACK [RFC7541] dynamic table without
   Huffman encoding, although specific Binary Structured Types might
   specify the use of such encodings.

   Note that BINHEADERS and HEADERS frames MAY be mixed on the same
   connection, depending on the requirements of the sender.  Also, note
   that only the field values are encoded as Binary Structured Types;
   field names are encoded as they are in HPACK.

4.  Using Binary Structured Headers with Existing Fields

   Any header field can potentially be parsed as a Structured Header
   according to the algorithms in [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]
   and serialised as a Binary Structured Header.  However, many cannot,
   so optimistically parsing them can be expensive.

   This section identifies fields that will usually succeed in
   Section 4.1, and those that can be mapped into Structured Headers by
   using an alias field name in Section 4.2.

4.1.  Directly Represented Fields

   The following HTTP field names can have their values parsed as
   Structured Headers according to the algorithms in
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure], and thus can usually be
   serialised using the corresponding Binary Structured Types.

   When one of these fields' values cannot be represented using
   Structured Types, its value can instead be represented as a String
   Literal (Section 2.1.4).

   Note that only the delta-seconds form of Retry-After is supported; a
   Retry-After value containing a http-date will need to be either
   converted into delta-seconds or serialised as a String Literal
   (Section 2.1.4).

4.2.  Aliased Fields

   The following HTTP field names can have their values represented in
   Structured headers by mapping them into its data types and then
   serialising the resulting Structured Header using an alternative
   field name.

   For example, the Date HTTP header field carries a http-date, which is
   a string representing a date:

   Date: Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT

   Its value is more efficiently represented as an integer number of
   delta seconds from the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970,
   minus leap seconds).  Thus, the example above would be represented in
   (non-binary) Structured headers as:

   SH-Date: 784072177

   As with directly represented fields, if the intended value of an
   aliased field cannot be represented using Structured Types

   successfully, its value can instead be represented as a String
   Literal (Section 2.1.4).

   Note that senders MUST know that the next-hop recipient understands
   these fields (typically, using the negotiation mechanism defined in
   Section 3) before using them.  Likewise, recipients MUST transform
   them back to their unaliased form before forwarding the message to a
   peer or other consuming components that do not have this capability.

   Each field name listed below indicates a replacement field name and a
   way to map its value to Structured Headers.

   ISSUE: using separate names assures that the different syntax doesn't
   "leak" into normal headers, but it isn't strictly necessary if
   implementations always convert back to the correct form when giving
   it to peers or consuming software that doesn't understand this.

4.2.1.  URLs

   The following field names (paired with their replacement field names)
   have values that can be represented in Binary Structured Headers by
   considering their payload a string.

   o  Content-Location - SH-Content-Location

   o  Location - SH-Location

   o  Referer - SH-Referer

   For example, a (non-binary) Location:

   SH-Location: "https://example.com/foo"

   TOOD: list of strings, one for each path segment, to allow better
   compression in the future?

4.2.2.  Dates

   The following field names (paired with their replacement field names)
   have values that can be represented in Binary Structured Headers by
   parsing their payload according to [RFC7230], Section 7.1.1.1, and
   representing the result as an integer number of seconds delta from
   the Unix Epoch (00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970, minus leap seconds).

   o  Date - SH-Date

   o  Expires - SH-Expires

   o  If-Modified-Since - SH-IMS

   o  If-Unmodified-Since - SH-IUS

   o  Last-Modified - SH-LM

   For example, a (non-binary) Expires:

   SH-Expires: 1571965240

4.2.3.  ETags

   The following field names (paired with their replacement field names)
   have values that can be represented in Binary Structured Headers by
   representing the entity-tag as a string, and the weakness flag as a
   boolean "w" parameter on it, where true indicates that the entity-tag
   is weak; if 0 or unset, the entity-tag is strong.

   o  ETag - SH-ETag

   For example, a (non-Binary) ETag:

   SH-ETag: "abcdef"; w=?1

   If-None-Match is a list of the structure described above.

   o  If-None-Match - SH-INM

   For example, a (non-binary) If-None-Match:

   SH-INM: "abcdef"; w=?1, "ghijkl"

4.2.4.  Links

   The field-value of the Link header field [RFC8288] can be represented
   in Binary Structured Headers by representing the URI-Reference as a
   string, and link-param as parameters.

   o  Link: SH-Link

   For example, a (non-binary) Link:

   SH-Link: "/terms"; rel="copyright"; anchor="#foo"

4.2.5.  Cookies

   The field-value of the Cookie and Set-Cookie fields [RFC6265] can be
   represented in Binary Structured Headers as a List with parameters
   and a Dictionary, respectively.  The serialisation is almost
   identical, except that the Expires parameter is always a string (as
   it can contain a comma), multiple cookie-strings can appear in Set-
   Cookie, and cookie-pairs are delimited in Cookie by a comma, rather
   than a semicolon.

   Set-Cookie: SH-Set-Cookie Cookie: SH-Cookie

   SH-Set-Cookie: lang=en-US, Expires="Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT"
   SH-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42, lang=en-US

   ISSUE: explicitly convert Expires to an integer?

5.  IANA Considerations

   ISSUE: todo

6.  Security Considerations

   As is so often the case, having alternative representations of data
   brings the potential for security weaknesses, when attackers exploit
   the differences between those representations and their handling.

   One mitigation to this risk is the strictness of parsing for both
   non-binary and binary Structured Headers data types, along with the
   "escape valve" of String Literals (Section 2.1.4).  Therefore,
   implementation divergence from this strictness can have security
   impact.
