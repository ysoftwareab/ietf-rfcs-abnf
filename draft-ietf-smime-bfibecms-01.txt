        1. Introduction 

        This document defines the steps needed to use the Boneh-Franklin [BF] 
        and Boneh-Boyen [BB1] identity-based encryption (IBE) public-key 
        algorithms in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [CMS]. IBE is a 
        public key technology for encrypting content-encryption keys (CEKs) 
        that can be implemented within the framework of the CMS: the 
        recipient's identity is incorporated into the EnvelopedData CMS 
        content type using the OtherRecipientInfo CHOICE in the RecipientInfo 
        field as defined in section 6.2.5 of [CMS]. This document does not 
        describe the implementation of the BF and BB1 algorithms, which are 
        described in detail in [IBCS].  

        IBE algorithms are a type of public-key cryptographic algorithm in 
        which the public key is calculated directly from a user's identity 
        instead of being generated randomly. This requires a different set of 
        steps for encryption and decryption than would be used with other 
        public-key algorithms, and these steps are defined in Sections 4 and 
        5 of this document respectively.

        This document also defines the object identifiers and syntax of the 
        object that is used to define the identity of a message recipient.  

        CMS values and identity objects are defined using ANS.1 [ASN1]. 

        1.1. Terminology 

        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
        document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [KEYWORDS]. 

        2. Using identity-based encryption 

        To use IBE, the OtherRecipientInfo field MUST be set to an 
        IBEOtherRecipient type.  

        IBEOtherRecipientInfo ::= SEQUENCE { 
          ibeORIType      OBJECT IDENTIFIER, 
          ibeORIValue     IBERecipientInfo  
        } 
         
        The fields of IBEOtherRecipientInfo have the following meanings: 

        ibeORIType defines the object identifier (OID) that indicates that 
        the subsequent ibeORIValue is the information necessary to decrypt 
        the message using IBE. This field MUST be set to  

        ibeORIType OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu(2) country(16)  
          us(840) organization(1) identicrypt(114334) ibcs(1)  
          cms(4) ori-oid(1) } 
         
        ibeORIValue defines the identity that was used in the IBE algorithm 
        to encrypt the CEK. This is an IBERecipientInfo type.  

        IBERecipientInfo ::= SEQUENCE { 
          cmsVersion         INTEGER { v3(3) }, 
          keyFetchMethod     OBJECT IDENTIFIER, 
          recipientIdentity  IBEIdentityInfo, 
          serverInfo         SEQUENCE OF OIDValuePairs OPTIONAL, 
          encryptedKey       EncryptedKey 
        } 
         
        The fields of IBERecipientInfo have the following meanings: 

        The cmsVersion MUST be set to 3.

     Internet-Draft            Using IBE with CMS               October 2006 
         

        The keyFetchMethod is the OID that defines the method of retrieving 
        the private key that the recipient MUST use. How to retrieve an IBE 
        private key using the steps defined in [IBE] is defined by the 
        keyFetchMethod OID. The method for retrieving private keys that is 
        specified in [IBE] is defined by cmsPPSOID.  

        cmsPPSOID OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu(2) country(16)  
          us(840) organization(1) identicrypt(114334) pps-schemas(3) 
          ic-schemas(1) pps-uri(1)  
        } 
         
        The recipientIdentity is the data that was used to calculate the 
        public key that was used to encrypt the CEK. This MUST be an 
        IBEIdentityInfo type. This recipientIdentity is used to calculate IBE 
        public and private keys as described in [IBCS]. 

        IBEIdentityInfo ::= SEQUENCE { 
          District        UTF8STRING, 
          Serial          INTEGER, 
          identitySchema  OBJECT IDENTIFIER, 
          identityData    OCTET STRING 
        } 
         
        The fields of IBEIdentityInfo have the following meanings. 

        The district and serial are unique identifiers that are used to 
        construct the URI for the location of where the IBE public parameters 
        are located. The construction and use of this URI is defined in 
        [IBE].  

        The identitySchema defines the format that is used to encode the 
        information that defines the identity of the recipient. This MUST be 
        set to cmsIdentityOID. 

        cmsIdentityOID OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu(2) country(16)  
           us(840) organization(1) identicrypt(114334) keyschemas(2) 
           icschemas(1) rfc822email(1)  
        } 
         
        The identityData is the identity of the recipient. For use in S/MIME, 
        this MUST be an EmailIdentitySchema type which is DER encoded. Other 
        applications MAY use other formats for the identityData.

        EmailIdentitySchema ::= SEQUENCE { 
          rfc822Email UTF8STRING, 
          time        GeneralizedTime 
        } 
         
        The rfc822Email is the DER-encoded e-mail address of the recipient in 
        the format defined by [RFC822]. 

        The value of "time" is the DER-encoded UTC time after which the 
        sender wants to let the recipient decrypt the message, so it may be 
        called the "not-before" time. This is usually set to the time when 
        the message is encrypted, but MAY be set to a future time. UTC time 
        values are expressed to the nearest second. 

        The sender of an IBE-encrypted message may want to express this time 
        rounded to a larger time interval to create a key lifetime and reduce 
        the number of IBE private keys that a recipient needs to retrieve. 
        Based on the time interval chosen a recipient would only have to 
        retrieve a new IBE key once during the interval. To do this, follow 
        the following steps. Let "time-interval" be the number of seconds in 
        this larger time interval. 

           1. Find the GeneralizedTime for the not-before value. 

           2. Convert this GeneralizedTime into the number of seconds since  

              January 1, 1970. Call this "total-time." 

           3. Calculate reduced-time = ( floor(total-time /  

              time-interval) ) * time-interval. 

           4. Convert reduced-time to a GeneralizedTime to get the not-before 
        "time" value. 

        An example of this algorithm for computing a one week time interval 
        is: 

           1. Say the GeneralizedTime is 20020401000000Z 

           2. The total-time is 1017612000 

           3. A time-interval of 1 week is 604800 seconds. So the reduced-
          time = (floor(1017612000/604800))* 604800 = 1017273600 

           4. Giving the reduced-time GeneralizedTime for a 1 week time 
          interval of 20020328000000Z

        3. Algorithm object identifiers 

        The BF and BB1 algorithms as defined in [IBCS] have the following 
        object identifiers: 

        bf OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu(2) country(16) us(840)        
           organization(1) identicrypt(114334) ibcs(1) ibcs1(1)  
           ibe-algorithms(2) bf(1) } 
         
        This is the object identifier that MUST be inserted in the 
        keyEncryptionAlgorithm field in the CMS when the BF algorithm is used 
        to encrypt the CEK. 

        bb1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu(2) country(16) us(840)        
           organization(1) identicrypt(114334) ibcs(1) ibcs1(1)  
           ibe-algorithms(2) bb1(2) } 
         
        This is the object identifier that MUST be inserted in the 
        keyEncryptionAlgorithm field in the CMS when the BB1 algorithm is 
        used to encrypt the CEK. 

        4. Processing by the sender 

        The sender of a message that uses IBE to encrypt content encryption 
        keys performs the following steps: 

           1. Selects a set of IBE public parameters to use in the subsequent 
        steps in accordance with his local security policy. He then 
        determines the URI where the public parameters can be obtained using 
        the process described in [IBE]. This information MUST be encoded in 
        the IBEIdentityInfo as described in Section 2. 

           2. Sets the fields of an OtherRecipientInfo object to their 
        appropriate values as described in Section 2. 

           3. Calculates an IBE public key as defined in [IBCS] using this 
        IBEIdentityInfo as the identity information. 

           4. This IBE public key is then used to encrypt the content 
        encryption key (CEK), using the algorithms that are defined in 
        [IBCS]. 

           5. Sets encryptedKey to the IBE-encrypted CEK. 

           6. Within the CMS, keyEncryptionAlgorithm MUST then be set to the 
        appropriate OID for the IBE algorithm that was used (see Section 3).

        5. Processing by the receiver 

        Upon receiving a message that has a CEK encrypted with IBE, the 
        recipient performs the following steps to decrypt the CEK: 

           1. Determines that the CEK is IBE-encrypted by noting that the 
             oriType of the OtherRecipientInfo type is set to ibeORIType. 

           2. Determines that the recipientIdentity was used as the identity 
             in IBE encryption of the CEK. 

           3. Determines the location of the IBE public parameters and the 
             IBE Private Key Generator as described in [IBE]. 

           4. Obtains the IBE public parameters from the location determined 
             in Step 3 using the process defined in [IBE]. 

           5. Obtains the IBE private key needed to decrypt the encrypted CEK 
             using the process defined in [IBE]. 

           6. Decrypts the CEK using the IBE private key obtained in Step 4 
             using the algorithms described in [IBCS].

        7. Security Considerations 

        This document is based on [CMS] and [IBCS], and the relevant security 
        considerations of those documents apply. In addition, the following 
        considerations that are particular to this document. 

          7.1. Attacks that are outside the scope of this document 

        Attacks on the cryptographic algorithms that are used to implement 
        IBE are outside the scope of this document. Such attacks are detailed 
        in [IBCS], which defines parameters that will give the equivalent of 
        80-bit security, 112-bit security and 128-bit security. We assume 
        that competent administrators of an IBE system will select parameters 
        that provide a sufficient resistance to cryptanalytic attacks by 
        adversaries. 

        Attacks that require access to machines used by either the client or 
        the server components defined in this document are also outside the 
        scope of this document. Attacks that give an attacker the ability to 
        access or change the information on a PPS or PKG, especially the 
        cryptographic material, will defeat the security of an IBE system. To 
        address this concern, the PPS and PKG servers SHOULD be configured in 
        accordance with best current practices [NIST]. An IBE system should 
        be operated in an environment where such illicit access is infeasible 
        for attackers to obtain. 

        We also assume that all administrators of a system implementing the 
        protocols that are defined in this document are trustworthy and will 
        not abuse their authority to bypass the security provided by an IBE 
        system. Similarly, we assume that users of an IBE system will behave 
        responsibly, not sharing their authentication credentials with 
        others. Thus attacks that require such assumptions are outside the 
        scope of this document.

        document, as are attacks that let an adversary masquerade as a PPS or 
        PKG are also within the scope of this document. 

          7.3. Attacks that the protocols defined in this document are 
             susceptible to 

        The protocols defined in this document do not explicitly defend 
        against an attacker masquerading as a legitimate IBE PPS or PKG. To 
        provide protection against this possibility, client software that 
        implements the protocols defined in this document SHOULD have a user 
        interface that allows users to view the details of connections to PPS 
        and PKG servers so that users cannot easily be tricked into providing 
        valid authorization credentials to an attacker.  

        The protocols defined in this document are also vulnerable to Denial 
        of Service attacks against an IBE PPS or PKG. DOS attacks against 
        either component can result in users unable to access the information 
        and services required to encrypt or decrypt using IBE, and users of 
        an IBE system SHOULD take the appropriate countermeasures [RFC2827, 
        RFC3882] that their use of IBE requires.  

          7.4. Attacks that the protocols defined in this document protect 
             against 

        All communications between users of an IBE system and the PPS or PKG 
        are encrypted using SSL 3.0 [SSL] or TLS 1.1 [TLS], which should 
        provide an adequate level of protection for such communications. 

        The authentication method used by an IBE PKG should also be 
        sufficiently strong to prevent attackers from easily guessing them 
        through trial and error.   

        8. IANA Considerations 

        All of the object identifiers used in this document were assigned by 
        the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), so no 
        further action by the IANA is necessary for this document.
