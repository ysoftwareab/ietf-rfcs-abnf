Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is network based mobility management
   protocol which allows IP session continuity for a mobile node (MN)
   without its involvement in mobility management.  A mobile access
   gateway (MAG) is authorized to send Mobile IPv6 signaling messages on
   behalf of mobile nodes.  The MAG requires a local mobility anchor
   address (LMAA), mobile node's identifier (MN-Identifier),and IPSec
   security association (SA) with it's LMA before it sends signaling
   messages.  Interworking with existing authentication, authorization
   and accounting (AAA) infrastructure, MAG acquires the LMAA (directly
   or indirectly) and MN-Identifier.  Local mobility anchor (LMA) also
   uses AAA infrastructure to authenticate MAG and build SA between MAG
   when IKEv2 IPSec is used for security between MAG and LMA .  This
   document defines new RADIUS attributes and reasonably reuses existing
   attributes to serve the purpose.  This information exchange takes
   place as part of the initial network access authentication procedure.
   Address configuration modes and others can also be obtained from AAA
   infrastructure to emulate MN's home link on access links.

1.  Introduction

   It is possible to support mobility for IPv6 nodes by extending Mobile
   IPv6 [RFC3775] signaling and reusing the home agent via a proxy
   mobility agent in the network.  [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6] describes
   the approach to supporting mobility without requiring the mobile node
   to be involved in mobility management signaling.  The proxy mobility
   agent in the network performs the signaling and does the mobility
   management on behalf of the mobile node.  From AAA perspective, the
   operation of Proxy Mobile IPv6 includes the following parts:

   Access Authentication:

      When a MN roams into a PMIPv6 domain and attaches to an access
      link connected to the MAG, the MN may present its identity and
      home realm, as part of the access authentication procedure.  Upon
      a successful access authentication, MAG acting as an RADIUS client
      obtains the MN's policy profile from AAA server using RADIUS
      protocol.  The policy profile contains for example the following
      information: LMAA, Home Network Prefix (MN-HNP) and an AAA
      assigned MN's temporary identity.

   Security Association Establishment:

      After a successful access authentication and authorization, the
      MAG MUST send a Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message to the LMA
      assigned to the MN.  The signaling messages, Proxy Binding Update
      and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement SHOULD be protected using IPSec.
      In PMIPv6, a security association (SA) between a LMA and a MAG are
      shared by multiple MNs.  Before sending a PBU message, the MAG
      checks if there is an existing SA established between the MAG and
      the LMA.  The MAG initiates a SA establishment procedure if there
      is no existing SA.  IKEv2 [RFC4306] SHOULD be used for a dynamic
      SA setup between the MAG and the LMA.  The MAG and the LMA can use
      any available mechanisms for a mutual authentication (i.e., shared
      secret/certificate/EAP) and IKEv2 initiator identity used during
      the SA setup is the MAG's identity.  The MAG and LMA message
      exchange in SA setup is outside of scope of this document.  In
      this specification, only AAA interfaces related to the SA setup
      are discussed.

   MN home address configuration:

      An important function of PMIPv6 is the emulation of the MN's home
      link on the access link.  The MN can operate in an IPv4-only mode,
      IPv6-only mode or in dual IPv4/IPv6 mode.  The MN can obtain IPv6
      address through DHCPv6 or stateless auto-configuration.  In the
      DHCPv6 case, the MAG can have DHCPv6 relay functionality and relay

      DHCPv6 messages between the MN and a DHCPv6 server.  Alternatively
      the MAG may act as a DHCPv6 server.  In the latter case, the MAG
      can obtain MN-HoA from AAA server, or from LMA through PBU/PBA
      exchange.  In the stateless address auto-configuration case, the
      MN can also use the prefix advertised in a Router Advertisement
      sent by the MAG to configure an IPv6 address.  The MN-HNP can be
      obtained from the AAA server or from the LMA.  Once the MN-HoA
      configuration is finished, the MAG may send Access-Request to
      trigger a dynamic DNS update for MN-HoA.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6].




3.  Solution Overview

3.1.  Mobile IPv6 Bootstrapping Overview

   [RFC4640] is problem statement for bootstrapping Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6).
   In MIPv6 scenario, a MN needs at least the following information: a
   home address, a home agent address, and a security association with
   home agent to register.  The process to obtain this information is
   called bootstrapping.  [RFC4640] discusses issues involved in how the
   MN can be bootstrapped and various potential deployment scenarios for
   the MN's bootstrapping.

   Two deployments scenarios are defined in [RFC4640]: a split scenario
   and an integrated scenario.  The essential difference between the two
   scenarios is that in the split scenario, the mobility service and the
   network access service are authorized by different entities while in
   integrated scenario, the two services are authorized by the same
   entity.  [RFC5026] details bootstrapping solution for the split
   scenario, while [I-D.ietf-mip6-bootstrapping-integrated-dhc]
   describes the solution for the integrated scenario.  Furthermore,
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-hiopt] defines new DHCP options to be used for dynamic
   home information discovery in the integrated scenario.

   To facilitate these solutions, the AAA functionality for the
   integrated and the split scenarios need to be defined.

Internet-Draft                RADIUS-PMIPv6                February 2008


   [I-D.ietf-mip6-radius] defines new RADIUS attributes to facilitate
   Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping in both integrated and split scenarios.
   [I-D.ietf-dime-mip6-integrated] describes Diameter interface between
   a network access server and a home AAA server in the integrated
   scenario.  [I-D.ietf-dime-mip6-split] specifies Diameter interface
   between a home agent and a home AAA server in the split scenario.

   The integrated scenario seems more suitable for PMIPv6 because the
   bootstrapping is a part of the access authentication procedure.
   Therefore, we will not present all details of PMIPv6 bootstrapping
   but instead we will only highlight special considerations that apply
   to PMIPv6.

3.2.  Proxy Mobile IPv6 Bootstrapping Procedure

   PMIPv6 offloads mobility management to the network.  The MAG needs at
   least the following information during the PMIPv6 bootstrapping: the
   LMAA , a MN-HNP or a MN-HoA, a MN-Identifier, and a MAG to LMA SA.
   The MN-Identifier may also be the MN-HoA.  The process of obtaining
   this information is called PMIPv6 bootstrapping in this document.

3.2.1.  Security Association Setup

   The LMA MUST allow only authorized MAGs to create binding cache
   entries on behalf of the mobile nodes.  Security Associations should
   be setup before sending the first PBU.  There MAY be a separate
   security association for each different Realm mobile nodes have.
   However, this is up to the deployment and operators to decide.

   In [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6], the example Peer Authorization
   Database (PAD) entries are illustrated as following.


         mobile access gateway PAD:
           - IF remote_identity = lma_identity_1
                Then authenticate (shared secret/certificate/EAP)
                and authorize CHILD_SA for remote address lma_addres_1

         local mobility anchor PAD:
           - IF remote_identity = mag_identity_1
                Then authenticate (shared secret/certificate/EAP)
                and authorize CHILD_SAs for remote address mag_address_1


   For example, a MAG inspects destination address of each packet, and
   initiates a SA setup process if the destination address matches an
   entry in the PAD.

Internet-Draft                RADIUS-PMIPv6                February 2008


   IKEv2 SHOULD be used to setup a SA between the MAG and the LMA to
   protect the PBU and PBA messages, and user plane traffic.  These SAs
   are shared by multiple MNs between the MAG and LMA pair .  The MAG
   and the LMA can use any of the authentication mechanisms (shared
   secret/certificate/EAP) described in [RFC4306] for mutual
   authentication and the security association setup.  When EAP is used,
   the MAG acts as a supplicant and the LMA as an authenticator.  The
   LMA must follow the procedures defined in [RFC3579].  The LMA gets
   session key material from the RADIUS server through RADIUS Access-
   Accept message.  The key material is used for further SA
   establishment between the MAG and the LMA.

3.2.2.  Mobility Capability Negotiation

   Different network entities may have different mobility management
   capabilities.  A MN may support IPv6 or IPv4, MIPv4 or MIPv6.  A MAG
   may support IPv4 or IPv6, MIPv4, MIPv6, PMIPv4 or PMIPv6.  AAA
   servers may provide support for IPv4, IPv6, MIPv4, MIPv6, PMIPv4 and
   PMIPv6 subscriptions.  Negotiation mechanism may be necessary among
   MN, MAG, and AAA servers.  In this document, only mobility capability
   negotiation between a MAG and an AAA server is dealt with.  In
   [I-D.korhonen-dime-pmip6], the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP is used for
   the negotiation.  Same attribute is also available for RADIUS
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-radius] that can be reused for PMIPv6 purposes.  The
   assigned values are defined in [I-D.korhonen-dime-pmip6].  The MAG
   sends Access-Request message with MIP6-Feature-Vector attribute to
   announce its capabilities and the AAA server returns mutually
   supported capabilities in the MIP6-Feature-Vector attribute in the
   Access-Accept reply message.  The mutually agreed on capability set
   may also be affected by the MN subscription and operator policy.

3.2.3.  Dynamic LMA Assignment

   [I-D.ietf-mip6-hiopt] defines a DHCP-based scheme to enable dynamic
   discovery of Mobile IPv6 home agent address, home agent FQDN and home
   network prefix.  Similarly, a MAG can act as a DHCP client to
   dynamically request a LMAA, or a LMA FQDN.  A MAG may also receive
   the LMAA or the LMA FQDN as a part of the MN access authentication.

                     Figure 2: Dynamic LMA Using DHCP

   1.  An MN initiates authentication when the MN accesses the networks.
   2.  After successful authentication, the LMAA or the LMA's FQDN can
       be included in RADIUS Access-Accept message.  The LMAA MUST be
       used if it is present.  The LMA's FQDN can be used to retrieve
       LMAA from either a DHCP server or a DNS server if the LMAA is not
       present in a RADIUS Access-Accept message.  It is out of the
       scope for the MAG to get a LMAA from a DHCP server or a DNS
       server.  The following DHCP exchanges are listed as an example.
   3.  The MAG as a DHCP client sends Information-Request for LMAA
       information according to [I-D.ietf-mip6-hiopt].  In the referred
       document, even there isn't any LMA's information in RADIUS
       Access-Accept, MAG can still dynamically find a LMAA from it's a
       DHCP server.
   4.  A DHCP relay or a DHCP server sends LMAA information through a
       DHCP Reply message.  For further details, please refer to
       [I-D.ietf-mip6-hiopt].

3.2.4.  DNS Update

   In order that the MN is reachable through its dynamically assigned
   Home Address, the DNS needs to be updated with the new Home Address.
   Since the DNS update must be performed securely in order to prevent
   attacks or modifications from malicious nodes, the node performing
   this update must share a security association with the DNS server.
   In this case the MAG may not share a security association with the
   DNS server and the DNS entry update can be performed by the AAA
   server.  In order to accomplish this, the MAG sends to the AAA server
   the FQDN-HoA pair using the RADIUS protocol.

                     Figure 3: DNS Update through AAA

   Figure 3 illustrates a typical MN-HoA DNS Update procedure
   1.  After successful access authentication and authorization, the MAG
       MUST send a Proxy Binding Update message to the LMA.  The Proxy
       Binding Update message MUST have the Home Network Prefix option.
       MAG can learn the prefix from AAA server or from other means, and
       include the prefix in the Home Network Prefix option for
       requesting it from the local mobility anchor.  If the specified
       value is 0::/0, then the LMA will allocate a prefix to the mobile
       node.
   2.  Successful PBA includes confirmed prefix which is advertised in
       Router Advertisement message by MAG to MN for stateless address
       auto-configuration.
   3.  Once address configuration finishes, the MAG sends Access-Request
       with MIP6-DNS-MO Attribute defined in [I-D.ietf-mip6-radius].
   4.  The AAA server performs the DNS update based on [RFC2136].
   5.  MIP6-DNS-MO attribute SHOULD be included in Access-Accept to
       confirm the DNS update.

3.2.5.  Home Link Emulation

   In PMIPv6, MAG is also responsible for emulating the MN's home link
   on the access link.  The characteristics of links are prefix, address
   configuration mode, MTU, link layer address of the default address
   and so on.  To keep the consistency of link characteristics, MN's
   prefix is allocated from LMA or AAA server.  MN's address
   configuration mode SHOULD be conveyed in Access-Accept in PMIP6-HL-

   Feature attribute defined in Section 4.1 .  The other parameters have
   limited impact on MN's behavior, so we offer no further discussion.

3.2.6.  IPv4 Support

   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support] specifies extensions to the
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol for supporting IPv4.  IPv4 support in
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 includes the support for the mobile node's IPv4
   home address mobility and for supporting the scenario where the local
   mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway are separated by an
   IPv4 transport network.  The IPv4 Local Mobility Anchor Address and
   MN's IPv4 Home Address SHOULD be included in RADIUS Access-Accept
   message.

3.2.7.  Mobile Node Identity

   During the access authentication the MN needs to provide at least its
   home realm to the MAG.  The MAG uses the realm information to route
   the subsequent RADIUS requests to MN's home AAA server.  Furthermore,
   the MAG needs to know the MN Identity when sending a Proxy binding
   update to the LMA.  However, depending on the used authentication
   mechanism the MAG may not be able to learn the MN identity.  For
   example various EAP-methods provide identity hiding functionality.
   In this case the home AAA server MUST provide a temporary identity to
   the MAG to be used in subsequent proxy binding updates.  The
   Chargeable User Id attribute [RFC4372] should be used to for
   conveying the temporary MN Identity from the AAA server to the MAG.
   The MAG announces its capability to handle identities provided by the
   Chargeable User Identity using the capability negotiation as defined
   in [RFC4372].

3.3.  Accounting

3.3.1.  Accounting at LMA

   The accounting at the LMA to AAA server interface is based on
   [RFC2865] and [RFC2866].  The interface must support the transfer of
   accounting records needed for service control and charging.  These
   include (but may not be limited to): time of binding cache entry
   creation and deletion, octets sent and received by the MN in bi-
   directional tunneling, etc.

3.3.2.  Accounting at MAG

   The accounting at the MAG to AAA server interface is based on
   [RFC2865] and [RFC2866].  The interface must also support the
   transfer of accounting records which include: time of binding cache
   entry creation and deletion, octets sent and received by the MN in

   bi-directional tunneling, etc.

   If there is data traffic between a visiting mobile node and a
   correspondent node that is locally attached to an access link
   connected to the mobile access gateway, the mobile access gateway MAY
   optimize on the delivery efforts by locally routing the packets and
   by not reverse tunneling them to the mobile node's local mobility
   anchor.  In this case, local data traffic MUST be reported to AAA
   servers through RADIUS protocol.


4.  RADIUS Attributes

   This section describes the RADIUS Proxy Mobile IPv6 support
   attributes.

4.1.  PMIPv6 MN-HoA configuration mode

   The new defined attribute (MN-HoA configuration) is included in
   Access-Accept message for MAG to emulate MN's home link.

       Reserved:

          Reserved for future use.

       DHCP server address:

          When M bit is set, the field holds DHCP server's address.


4.2.  Use of existing RADIUS Attributes

   This specification reuses RADIUS Mobile IPv6 support attributes
   defined in [I-D.ietf-mip6-radius] for PMIPv6 purposes.

4.2.1.  MIP6-HA Attribute

   The RADIUS server may dynamically assign a LMA to the MN based on the
   LMA location, current load or a local policy.

4.2.2.  MIP6-HA-FQDN Attribute

   LMA IP address.

4.2.3.  MIP6-HL-Prefix Attribute

   The RADIUS server may assign a Home Link that is in close proximity
   to the MAG.  The MN can use this prefix to configure a MN-HoA.

4.2.4.  MIP6-DNS-MO Attribute

   By using this payload the MAG as a RADIUS client instructs the RADIUS
   server to perform a dynamic DNS update.

4.2.5.  MIP-MN-HoA Attribute

   The attribute and the following are defined in
   [I-D.nakhjiri-radius-mip4] .  In this document, these attributes are
   properly reused in PMIPv6 scenario.

   By using this payload a RADIUS server deliver MN's MIPv4 Home
   Address.

4.2.6.  MIP-HA-IP Attribute

   By using this payload a RADIUS server deliver MN's Home Agent
   Address.

4.2.7.  Service-Type

   The attribute and the following are defined in [RFC2865] .  In this
   document, these attributes are properly reused in PMIPv6 scenario.

   Service-Type (6) SHALL set its value to "Framed" (2).

4.2.8.  Chargeable User Id

   This attribute MAY be used to convey a temporary MN Identifier that
   was assigned by the AAA server.  The use of this attribute is defined
   in [RFC4372].

4.2.9.  Calling-Station-Id

   This attribute MAY be present in Access-Request message and contains
   the MN Interface identifier.

4.2.10.  Callback-Id

4.2.11.  MS-MPPE-Recv-Key and MS-MPPE-Send-Key

   When EAP is used in IKEv2 SA establishment, the RADIUS server SHOULD
   transport the MSK from to LMA or MAG.  The MS-MPPE-Recv-Key and the
   MS-MPPE-Send-Key as defined in [RFC2548] are used for the
   transportation.  The first up to 32 octets of the MSK is stored into
   the MS-MPPE-Recv-Key, and the next up to 32 octets are stored into
   the MS-MPPE-Send-Key.  The encryption of these attributes is
   described in [RFC2548].

4.3.  Table of Attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in authentication and authorization process.

5.  Diameter Considerations

   When used in Diameter, the attributes defined in this specification
   can be used as Diameter AVPs from the Code space 1-255 (RADIUS
   attribute compatibility space).  Diameter PMIPv6 support is defined
   in [I-D.korhonen-dime-pmip6].


6.  Security Considerations

   The MAG and the LMA to the RADIUS server transactions must be
   adequately secured.  Otherwise there is a possibility that fraudulent
   values are received from a rogue RADIUS server.  The new attributes
   defined in this document do not introduce additional security
   considerations.


7.  IANA consideration

   The type of attribute PMIPv6 MN-HoA configuration mode MUST be
   assigned by IANA.
