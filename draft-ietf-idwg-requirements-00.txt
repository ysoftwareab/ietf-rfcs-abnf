            1. Abstract
            
                 The purpose of the Intrusion Detection Exchange Format is to
                 define data formats and exchange procedures for sharing
                 information of interest to intrusion detection and response
                 systems, and to the management systems which may need to interact
                 with them.  This Internet-Draft describes the high-level
                 requirements for such communication, including the rationale for
                 those requirements. Scenarios are used to illustrate the
                 requirements.

            3.  Introduction
            
            This document defines requirements for the Intrusion Detection Exchange
            Format (IDEF), which is the intended work product of the Intrusion
            Detection Exchange Format Working Group (IDWG).  IDEF is planned to be
            a standard format which automated Intrusion Detection Systems can use
            for reporting events which they have deemed to be suspicious.
            
            3.1  Rationale
            
            The reasons such a format should be useful are as follows:
            
            1) A number of commercial and free Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are 
               available and more are coming onto the market all the time. Some 
               products are aimed at detecting intrusions on the network, others
               are aimed at host operating systems, while still others are aimed at
               applications.  Even within a given category, the products have very
               different strengths and weaknesses. Hence it is likely that customers
               will buy more than a single product. And customers will want to 
               observe the output of these products from a one or more console(s). A 
               standard format for reporting events will simplify this task greatly.
            
            2) Intrusions frequently involve multiple organizations as victims, or 
               multiple sites within the same organization.  Typically, those sites 
               will use different ID systems.  It would be very helpful to correlate
               such distributed intrusions across multiple sites and administrative 
               domains. Having reports from all sites in a common format would 
               facilitate this task
            
            3) The existence of a common format should allow components from 
               different ID systems to be integrated more readily. ID research
               should be able to be integrated into commercial products more easily.
            
            4) We feel that, in addition to enabling communication from an ID
               analyzer to an ID manager, the IDEF notification system may also 
               enable communications between a variety of IDS components. However,
               for the remainder of this document, we refer to the communications as
               going from an analyzer to a manager.
            
            All of these reasons suggest that a common format for reporting
            suspicious events should help the IDS market to grow and innovate more
            successfully, and should result in IDS users obtaining better results
            from deployment of ID systems.
            
            3.2  Intrusion Detection Terms
            
            In order to make the rest of the requirements clearer, we define some
            terms about typical intrusion detection systems.
            
            3.2.1 Activity:
            
            Instantiations of the data source that are identified by the analyzer as
            being of interest to the operator. Examples of this include (but are not
            limited to) network sessions, user activity, and application events.
            
            
            
            
            
            Wood                 Informational - December 22, 1999                 2
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            Activity can range from extremely serious occurrences (such as a
            unequivocally malicious attack) to less serious occurrences (such as
            unusual user activity that's worth a further look).
            
            3.2.2 Administrator:
            
            The human with responsibility for the day-to-day maintenance and
            management of organizational security. This individual may or may not
            be the same person charged with the deployment of the intrusion
            detection system and may or may not be the same person that is actually
            monitoring the output of the IDS. In some organizations, the 
            administrator is associated with the network or systems administration
            groups. In other organizations, it's an independent position.
            
            3.2.3 Alert:
            
            A message from an analyzer to a manager that an event has been detected.
            An alert typically contains information about the unusual activity that
            was detected, as well as the specifics of the occurrence.
            
            3.2.4 Analyzer:
            
            The ID component that analyzes the data collected by the sensor for
            signs of unauthorized or undesired activity or for events that might be
            of interest to the security administrator. In many existing ID systems,
            the sensor and the analyzer are part of the same component. In this
            document, the term analyzer is used generically to refer to the sender
            of the IDEF message.
            
            3.2.5 Data Source:
            
            The raw information that an intrusion detection system uses to detect
            unauthorized or undesired activity. Common data sources include (but
            are not limited to) raw network packets, operating system audit logs,
            application audit logs, and system-generated checksum data.
            
            3.2.6 Event:
            
            The occurrence in the data source that is detected by the analyzer and
            which may result in an IDEF alert being transmitted. For example, three
            failed logins in 10 seconds might indicate a brute-force login attack
            
            3.2.7 Manager:
            
            The ID component from which the security administrator manages the
            various components of the ID system. Management functions typically
            include (but are not limited to) sensor configuration, analyzer
            configuration, event notification management, data consolidation, and
            reporting.
            
            3.2.8 Notification:
            
            The method by which the IDS manager makes the operator aware of the
            event occurrence. In many ID systems, this is done via the display of a
            
            
            
            
            
            Wood                 Informational - December 22, 1999                 3
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            colored icon on the IDS manager screen, the transmission of an e-mail or
            pager message, or the transmission of an SNMP trap, although other
            notification techniques are also used.
            
            3.2.9 Operator:
            
            The human that is the primary user of the IDS manager. The operator
            often monitors the output of the ID system and initiates or recommends
            further action.
            
            3.2.10 Response:
            
            The actions taken in response to an event. Responses may be undertaken
            automatically by some entity in the ID system architecture or may be
            initiated by a human. Sending a notification to the operator is a very
            common response. Other responses include (but are not limited to)
            logging the activity, recording the raw data (from the data source) that
            characterized the event, terminating a network, user, or application
            session, or altering network or system access controls.
            
            3.2.11 Sensor:
            
            The ID component that collects data from the data source. The
            frequency of data collection will vary across IDS offerings.
            
            3.2.12 Signature:
            
            A rule used by the analyzer to identify interesting activity to the
            security administrator. Signatures represent one of the mechanisms
            (though not necessarily the only mechanism) by which ID systems detect
            intrusions.
            
            3.2.13 Security Policy:
            
            The predefined, formally documented statement which defines what
            services are allowed to be transported across the monitored segment of
            the network to support the business requirement. This includes, but it
            not limited to, which hosts are to be denied external network access.
            
            3.3  Architectural Assumptions
            
            In this document, as defined in the terms above, we assume that an
            analyzer determines somehow that a suspicious event has been seen by a
            sensor, and sends an alert to a management console.  The format of that
            alert is what IDEF proposes to standardize.
            
            For the purposes of this document, we assume that the analyzer and
            management console are separate components, and that they are
            communicating pairwise across a TCP/IP network.  No other form of
            communication between these entities is contemplated in this document,
            and no other use of IDEF alerts is considered.
            
            We try to make no further architectural assumptions than those just
            stated.  For example, the following points should not matter:
            
            
            
            
            
            Wood                 Informational - December 22, 1999                 4
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
              * Whether the sensor and the analyzer are integrated or separate.
            
              * Whether the analyzer and management console are isolated, or
                embedded in some large hierarchy or distributed mesh of components.
            
              * Whether the management console actually notifies a human, takes
                action automatically, or just analyzes incoming alerts and
                correlates them.
            
              * A component might act as an analyzer with respect to one component,
                but as a management console with respect to another.
            
            3.4  Organization of this document.
            
            Besides this requirements document, the IDWG working group should
            produce two other documents. The first should describe a data format or
            language for exchanging information about suspicious events.  In this
            document, we refer to that as the "data-format specification".  The
            second document should identify existing IETF protocols that are best
            used for conveying the data so formatted, and explain how to package
            this data in those existing formats. We refer to this as the
            "communication specification".
            
            Accordingly, the requirements here are partitioned into five sections
            
               * The first of these contains general requirements that apply to all
                 aspects of the IDEF specification.
            
               * The second section describes requirements on the formatting of IDEF
                 messages.
            
               * The third section outlines requirements on the transport of IDEF
                 messages from the analyzer to the manager.
            
               * The fourth section contains requirements on the content and 
                 semantics of the IDEF messages.
            
               * The final section places requirements on IDEF event definitions and
                 the event definition process.
            
            For each requirement, we attempt to state the requirement as clearly as
            possible without imposing an idea of what a design solution should be.
            Then we give the rationale for why this requirement is important, and
            state whether this should be an essential feature of the specification,
            or is beneficial but could be lacking if it is difficult to fulfill.
            Finally, where it seems necessary, we give an illustrative scenario.
            
            4.  General Requirements
            
            4.1   The IDEF shall reference and use previously published RFCs where
                  possible.
            
            4.1.1 Rationale: The IETF has already completed a great deal of research
                  and work into the areas of networks and security. In the interest

                  of time, it is smart business to implement already defined and
                  accepted standards.
            
            4.1.2 Scenario:
            
            
            4.2   The IDEF must operate in environments that contain IPv6 
                  implementations.2.2.1 Rationale: Since pure IPv4, hybrid 
                  IPv6/IPv4, and pure IPv6 environments are expected to exist
                  within the timeframe of IDEF implementations, the IDEF 
                  specification must support IPv6 environments.
            
            4.2.2 Scenario:
            
            
            5. Message Format
            
            5.1   IDEF message formats shall support full internationalization and 
                  localization.
            
            5.1.1 Rationale: Since network security and intrusion detection are
                  areas that cross geographic, political, and cultural boundaries,
                  the IDEF messages must be formatted such that they can be
                  presented to an operator in a local language and adhering to local
                  presentation customs.
            
            5.1.2 Scenario:
            
            
            5.2   The format of IDEF messages must support filtering and/or
                  aggregation of data by the manager.
            
            5.2.1 Rationale: Since it is anticipated that some managers may want to
                  perform filtering and/or data aggregation functions on IDEF 
                  messages, the IDEF messages must be structured to facilitate these
                  operations.
            
            5.2.2 Scenario:
            
            
            6.  Transport Requirements
            
            6.1   The IDEF must support reliable transmission of messages.
            
            6.1.1 Rationale: IDS managers often rely on receipt of data from IDS
                  analyzers to do their jobs effectively. Since IDS managers will
                  rely on IDEF messages for this purpose, it is important,
                  therefore, that IDEF messages be delivered reliably.
            
            6.1.2 Scenario: The IDEF system might rely upon TCP reliability
                  mechanisms or might design its own reliable protocol for use with
                  UDP.
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            Wood                 Informational - December 22, 1999                 6
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            6.2   The IDEF must support transmission of messages from analyzers 
                  outside firewalls to managers inside firewalls without requiring
                  changes to the firewall configuration that weaken the security of
                  the perimeter. The IDEF design must also be relatively easy to
                  implement.
            
            6.2.1 Rationale: Since IDEF analyzers are often placed outside firewalls
                  and since it is expected that IDEF managers will most often be 
                  located inside firewalls, it is necessary that analyzers be able
                  to send IDEF messages through a firewall. Setting up this
                  communication must not require changes to the configuration of the
                  intervening firewall(s) that weaken the security of the protected 
                  network.
            
            6.2.2 Scenario: One possible scenario is the use of TCP to convey IDEF
                  messages. If the destination ports of this communications channel 
                  are user-programmable, it may be possible for the IDEF system to 
                  use existing firewall tunnels without change to the firewall 
                  configuration.
            
            
            6.3   The IDEF must support peer-to-peer authentication of the analyzer
                  to the manager.
            
            6.3.1 Rationale: Since the alert messages are used by a manager to
                  direct responses or further investigation related to the security 
                  of an enterprise network, it is important that the receiver have
                  confidence in the identity of the sender. This is peer-to-peer 
                  authentication of the sender to the receiver. It must not be 
                  based on authentication of the underlying transport, for example, 
                  because of the risk that this authentication process may be 
                  subverted or misconfigured.
            
            6.3.2 Scenario: Analyzer process authenticates itself to manager process
                  via public key exchange or some other method.
            
            
            6.4   The IDEF must maintain confidentiality of the message content. The
                  selected design must be capable of supporting a variety of 
                  encryption algorithms and must be adaptable to a wide variety of 
                  environments.
            
            6.4.1 Rationale: IDEF messages potentially contain extremely sensitive
                  information (such as passwords) and would be of great interest to 
                  an intruder. Since it is likely some of these messages will be 
                  transmitted across uncontrolled network segments, it is important 
                  that the content be shielded. Furthermore, since the legal 
                  environment for encryption technologies is extremely varied and 
                  changes often, it is important that the design selected be capable 
                  of supporting a number of different encryption options and be 
                  adaptable by the user to a variety of environments.
            
            6.4.2 Scenario: The IDEF system might offer two different encryption
                  modules, one using 168-bit keys and another using 56-bit keys.

            6.5   The IDEF must ensure the integrity of the message content. The
                  selected design must be capable of supporting a variety of 
                  integrity algorithms and must be adaptable to a wide variety of 
                  environments.
            
            6.5.1 Rationale: IDEF messages are used by the manager to direct action
                  related to the security of the protected enterprise network. It is 
                  vital for the manager to be certain that the content of the 
                  message has not been changed after transmission.
            
            6.5.2 Scenario: An integrity hash, such as the MD5 algorithm, might be
                  part of the IDEF design.
            
            
            6.6   The IDEF should ensure non-repudiation of the message 
                  transmission.
            
            6.6.1 Rationale: 
            
            6.6.2 Scenario: 
            
            
            6.7   The IDEF communications mechanism should resist protocol denial of 
                  service attacks.
            
            6.7.1 Rationale:
            
            6.7.2 Scenario:
            
            
            6.8   The IDEF communications mechanism should resist malicious 
                  duplication of messages.
            
            6.8.1 Rationale:
            
            6.8.2 Scenario:
            
            
            7. Message Content
            
            7.1   The IDEF message must encompass all types of intrusion detection
                  mechanisms.
            
            7.1.1 Rationale: There are many types of intrusion detection systems 
                  that analyze a variety of data sources. Some are profile based and
                  operate on log files, attack signatures etc. Others are anomaly
                  based and define normal behavior and detect deviations from the
                  established baseline. Each of these systems report different data
                  that, in part, depends on their intrusion detection methodology. 
                  All must be supported by this standard.
            
            7.1.2 Scenario: An attacker invents a new attack. The profile-based
                  system does not detect it. An anomaly-based system detects the
            
            
            
            
            
            Wood                 Informational - December 22, 1999                 8
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
                  novel attack but it cannot provide an attack type in an alert
                  message.
            
            
            7.2   The IDEF must support reporting event creation date and time in 
                  each event. The IDEF may support reporting the attack detection 
                  date and time in addition to the event creation date and time.
                  Time shall be reported as the localtime and time zone offset on
                  the system generating the message. [See RFC 1902 for guidelines on
                  reporting time.] (supporting reporting across multiple timezones 
                  and correlating across multiple timezones)
            
                  The format for reporting the date must be compliant with all
                  current standards for Year 2000 rollover, and it must have 
                  sufficient capability to continue reporting date values past the
                  year 2038.
            
                  Time granularity in event messages shall not be specified by the
                  IDEF.
            
            7.2.1 Rationale: Time is important from both a reporting and correlation
                  point of view. Attack detection time may differ from the event
                  creation time as it may take some time to actually generate the
                  event message given that an attack has been detected. If the
                  sensing element can determine the time the attack occurred it is
                  strongly encouraged to place that information in the attack 
                  detection field.  The IDEF cannot assume a certain clock 
                  granularity on sensing elements, and so cannot impose any
                  requirements on the granularity of the event timestamps.
            
            7.2.2 Scenario:
            
            
            7.3   The IDEF message must provide information about the automatic
                  actions taken by the analyzer in response to the event (if any).
            
            7.3.1 Rationale: It is very important for the operator to know if
                  there was an automated response and what that response was. This
                  will help determine what further action to take, if any.
            
            7.3.2 Scenario: The attacker launches the attack, the ID system detects
                  the attack and disables the user account performing the suspicious
                  activity. This suspension is for 10 minutes to allow the operator
                  time to investigate the suspicious activity. The IDEF message
                  contains this information.
            
            
            7.4   The IDEF message must contain an indication of the potential 
                  impact of the attack, if it is known.
            
            7.4.1 Rationale: Information concerning the possible impact of the 
                  attack on the target system provides an indication of what the 
                  attacker is attempting to do and is critical data for the operator 
                  to perform damage assessment. Not all systems will be able to 
            
            
            
            
            
            Wood                 Informational - December 22, 1999                 9
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
                  determine this, but it is important data to transmit for those 
                  systems that can.
            
            7.4.2 Scenario: A buffer overflow attack is launched and detected by the
                  ID analyzer. The IDEF message may contain information that this
                  buffer overflow attack is an attempt to gain root or administrator
                  privilege on the target system. The ID operator may use this data
                  increase the priority of the response.
            
            
            7.5   The IDEF message must contain the identity of the vendor and the
                  tool that detected the attack.
            
            7.5.1 Rationale: Users may run multiple intrusion detection systems to
                  protect their enterprise. This data will help the systems
                  administrator determine which vendor and tool detected the attack.
            
            7.5.2 Scenario: Tool X from vendor Y detects a potential intrusion. A
                  message is sent reporting that it found a potential break-in with
                  X and Y specified. The operator is therefore able to include the
                  known capabilities or weaknesses of tool X in his decision
                  regarding further action.
            
            
            7.6   The IDEF message must support a vendor extension mechanism used to
                  define vendor specific data. The use of this mechanism by the
                  vendor is optional. This data contains vendor specific information
                  determined by each vendor. The vendors must indicate how to
                  interpret these extensions.
            
            7.6.1 Rationale: Vendors may wish to supply extra data such as the
                  version number of their product or other data that they believe
                  provides value added due to the specific nature of their product.
            
            7.6.2 Scenario: The vendor passes back detailed information specific to
                  their product after it detects a potential attack.
            
            
            7.7   The IDEF message may include a list of sensors that sensed the
                  event. This sensor list must be designated by a list of IP
                  addresses.
            
            7.7.1 Rationale: Intrusion detection sensors and analysis engines are
                  often not co-located. It is important to know where the event was
                  sensed.
            
            7.7.2 Scenario: A distributed intrusion detection system has sensors
                  placed throughout the enterprise. Detection of a sophisticated
                  attack might actually involve passing of data through many
                  analyzers, each of which performs a specific piece of analysis.
                  The ultimate reporting of this event to the ID manager might
                  include the IP addresses of all the analyzers involve in the
                  detection. This information might be used by the manager to
                  localize the attack to a specific portion of the network.
            
            
            
            
            
            Wood                 Informational - December 22, 1999                10
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            7.8   The content of IDEF messages must contain the identified name of
                  the attack if it is known. This name will be drawn from a 
                  standardized list of attacks or will be a vendor-specific name if 
                  the attack identity has not yet been standardized. It is not known 
                  how this list will be defined or updated, although requirements on 
                  the creation of this list are presented in the next section of 
                  this document. In addition, the message must contain the attack 
                  technique if it is known. The attack technique will also be 
                  selected from a list of attack technique identifiers.
            
            7.8.1 Rationale: Given than this document presents requirements on 
                  standardizing ID message formats so that an ID manager may receive 
                  alerts from analyzers from multiple vendors, it is important that 
                  the manager understand the semantics of the reported events. There 
                  is, therefore, a need to identify known attacks and store 
                  information concerning their method and possible fixes to these 
                  attacks. Some attacks are well known and this recognition can help 
                  the operator. The operator can also benefit from knowing the 
                  attack technique (e.g. flooding). 
            
            7.8.2 Scenario: Attacker launches an attack that is detected by two 
                  different analyzers from two distinct vendors. Both report the
                  same event identity to the ID manager, even though the algorithms 
                  used to detect the attack by each analyzer may have been 
                  different.
            
            
            7.9   The IDEF message must contain the identity of the source of the 
                  attack and target component identifier if it is known. In the case
                  of a network-based attack, this will be the source and destination
                  IP address of the session used to launch the attack. Note that the
                  identify of source and target will vary for other types of
                  attacks, such as those launched/detected at the operating system 
                  or application level.
            
            7.9.1 Rationale: This will allow the operator to identify the source and
                  target of the attack.
            
            7.9.2 Scenario: Attacker launches a network attack against a DNS server
                  using a buffer overflow attack. The IDEF alert message indicates
                  the DNS server as the target and includes the source IP address
                  used to launch the attack.
            
            
            7.10   The IDEF message must contain the ability to reference additional
                   detailed data related to this specific underlying event. It is 
                   optional for vendors to use this field.
            
            7.10.1 Rationale: Operators may want more information on specifics of 
                   the attack. This field, if filled in by the analyzer, may point
                   to additional or more detailed information about the intrusion
            
            
            
            
            
            
            Wood                 Informational - December 22, 1999                11
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            7.10.2 Scenario: Attacker attacks host and is detected by ID system. 
                   IDEF message contains a pointer to a set of records that gives 
                   access to system audit data.
            
            
            7.11   The semantics of the IDEF message must be well defined.
            
            7.11.1 Rationale: Good semantics are key to understanding what the 
                   message is trying to convey so there are no errors due to 
                   confusion over exactly what the message means. Operators will 
                   decide what action to take based on these messages, so it is 
                   important that they can interpret them correctly.
            
            7.11.2 Scenario: Without this requirement, the operator receives an IDEF 
                   message and interprets it one way. The vendor who constructed the 
                   message intended it to have a different meaning from the system 
                   administrator's interpretation. The resulting corrective action 
                   is, therefore, incorrect.
            
            
            7.12   The IDEF message must contain a field for an advisory from a 
                   noted authority such as the CERT. The vendor must fill in this
                   field if the information is available and applicable to the event
                   being reported.
            
            7.12.1 Rationale: This information is used by administrators to report 
                   and fix problems.
            
            7.12.2 Scenario: Attacker performs a well-known attack. CERT advisory 
                   number is included in IDEF message since the vendor has access to 
                   a list of CERT advisory numbers. Operator uses this information 
                   to initiate repairs on the vulnerable system.
            
            
            7.13   The IDEF message must contain a field for data on the degree of 
                   penetration achieved by the attack. The vendors have the option 
                   of specifying this data.
            
            7.13.1 Rationale: This information is valuable to determine the extent 
                   of damage to the system. Sometimes the attack fails and other 
                   times the attack is very successful and causes significant 
                   damage. Note that this information is not always available at the 
                   time or place the IDEF message is constructed.
            
            7.13.2 Scenario: Attempt to break into host system fails. This is 
                   reported in the IDEF message with degree of penetration equal to 
                   zero. The operator reduces the priority of this event, since it
                   appears no damage was done.
            
            
            7.14   The IDEF message must contain a field for data on the degree of 
                   confidence of the report. The completion of this field by an 
                   analyzer is optional, as this data may not be available at all
                   analyzers.

            7.14.1 Rationale: Many ID systems contain thresholds to determine 
                   whether or not to generate an alert. This may influence the 
                   degree of confidence one has in the report or perhaps would 
                   indicate the likelihood of the report being a false alarm. 
            
            7.14.2 Scenario: The alarm threshold monitor is set at a low level to 
                   indicate that an organization wants reports on any suspicious 
                   activity, regardless of the probability of a real attack. The 
                   degree of confidence measure is used to indicate if this is a low 
                   probability or high probability attack.
            
            
            8. Event Definitions and the Event-Definition Process
            
            8.1  The IDEF must be extensible. As new events are defined by the
                 community and as new methods of detecting them are offered by the
                 industry, the IDEF must be able to grow with the technology.
            
            8.1.1  Rationale:
            
            6.1.2  Scenario:
            
            8.2  The standard event definitions must be extensible by vendors and
                 users.
            
            8.2.1  Rationale:
            
            8.2.2  Scenario:
            
            
            8.3  The process by which new events are defined and standardized must
                 be vendor independent.
            
            8.3.1  Rationale:
            
            8.3.2  Scenario:
