Abstract

   HTTP Digest is known to be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks,
   even when run inside TLS, if the same passwords are used for
   authentication in some other context without TLS. This is a general
   problem that affects not just HTTP digest but also other IETF
   protocols. However, for a class of strong algorithms the attack is
   avoidable. This document defines version 2 of the HTTP Digest AKA
   algorithm. Unlike previous versions of HTTP Digest such as MD5 or
   AKAv1, this algorithm is immune to the man-in-the-middle attack.

2. Introduction

   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Authentication,
   described in [RFC2617], has been extended in [RFC3310] to support
   Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) mechanism [AKA-REF]. AKA
   mechanism performs authentication and session key distribution in
   Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks. HTTP
   Digest AKA enables the usage of AKA as a one-time password generation
   mechanism for Digest authentication.

   HTTP Digest is known to be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks,
   even when run inside TLS, if the same HTTP Digest authentication
   credentials are used in some other context without TLS. The attacker
   may initiate a TLS session with a server, and when the server
   challenges the attacker with HTTP Digest, the attacker masquerades
   the server to the victim. If the victim responds to the challenge,
   the attacker is able to use this response towards the server in HTTP
   Digest. Note that this attack is an instance of general attack that
   affects a number of IETF protocols such as PIC. The general problem
   is discussed in [Asokan-Niemi-Nyberg] and
   [Puthenkulam-binding-draft].

   Because of the previous vulnerability, the use of HTTP Digest "AKAv1"
   should be limited to the situations where the client is able to
   demonstrate that in addition to AKA response, it possess the AKA
   session keys. This is possible, for example, if the underlying
   security protocol uses the AKA generated session keys to protect the
   authentication response. This is the case for example in the 3GPP IP
   Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS) where HTTP Digest "AKAv1" is
   currently applied. However, HTTP Digest "AKAv1" should not be used
   with tunnelled security protocols that do not utilize the AKA session
   keys. For example, the use of HTTP Digest "AKAv1" is not necessarily
   secure with TLS if the server side is authenticated using
   certificates and the client side is authenticated using HTTP Digest
   AKA.

   There are at least four potential solutions to the problem:

   1.  The use of the authentication credentials is limited to one
       application only. However, this would increase the total number
       of authentication credentials for an end-user, and would cause
       scalability problems in the server side.

   2.  The keys used in the underlying security protocols are somehow
       bind to the keys used in the tunneled authentication protocol.
       However, this would cause problems with the current
       implementations of underlying security protocols. For example, it
       is not possible to use the session keys from TLS at application

       layer. Furthermore, this solution would only solve the problem
       when HTTP Digest is used over one hop, and leave the problem of
       using HTTP Digest via multiple hops, e.g. via proxy servers,
       unsolved.

   3.  Authentication credentials are used in cryptographically
       different way for each media and/or access network. However, it
       may be difficult to know which underlying media is used below the
       application.

   4.  Authentication credentials are used in cryptographically
       different way for each application.

   This document specifies a new algorithm version for HTTP Digest AKA,
   i.e. "AKAv2". "AKAv2" specifies a cryptographically different way to
   use AKA credentials in applications that are based either on HTTP
   Digest authentication or UMTS authentication (cf. approach 4 above).
   The only difference to "AKAv1" is that in addition to AKA response
   RES the AKA related session keys, IK and CK, are also used as the
   password for HTTP Digest. AKAv2 is immune to man-in-the-middle attack
   described above. However, if AKAv2 is used in some environment both
   with and without some underlying security, such as TLS, the problem
   still exists.

   New HTTP Digest AKA algorithm versions can be registered in IANA
   based on Expert Review. Documentation of new algorithm versions is
   not mandated as RFCs. However, "AKAv2" is documented as an RFC
   because the use of different AKA algorithm versions includes security
   implications that the implementators should be aware of. The
   extension version and security implications are presented in this
   document.

2.1 Terminology

   This chapter explains the terminology used in this document.

   AKA

      Authentication and Key Agreement.

      AKA is a challenge-response based mechanism that uses symmetric
      cryptography. AKA can be run in a UMTS IM Services Identity Module
      (ISIM) or in UMTS Subscriber Identity Module (USIM), which reside
      on a smart card like device that also provides tamper resistant
      storage of shared secrets.

   CK

      Cipher Key. An AKA session key for encryption.

   IK

      Integrity Key. An AKA session key for integrity check.

   ISIM

      IP Multimedia Services Identity Module. Sometimes ISIM is
      implemented using USIM.

   RES

      Authentication Response. Generated by the ISIM.

   SIM

      Subscriber Identity Module. GSM counter part for ISIM and USIM.

   UMTS

      Universal Mobile Telecommunications System.

   USIM

      UMTS Subscriber Identity Module. UMTS counter part for ISIM and
      SIM.

   XRES

      Expected Authentication Response. In a successful authentication
      this is equal to RES.

3. Digest password generation in AKAv2

   In general, the Digest AKAv2 operation is identical to the Digest
   AKAv1 operation described in  [RFC3310].  This chapter specifies the
   parts in which Digest AKAv2 is different from Digest AKAv1 operation.
   The notation used in the Augmented BNF definitions for the new and
   modified syntax elements in this section is as used in SIP [RFC3261],
   and any elements not defined in this section are as defined in
   [RFC3310].

   In order to direct the client into using AKAv2 for authentication
   instead of other AKA versions or other HTTP Digest algorithms, the
   AKA version directive of [RFC3310] shall have the following new
   value:


             aka-version         =  "AKAv2"

   The AKA version directive is used as a part of the algorithm field as
   defined in [RFC3310].


             Example:  algorithm=AKAv2-MD5

   The client shall use the concatenated AKA parameters (RES||IK||CK) as
   a "password" when calculating the HTTP Digest response directive for
   AKAv2.

   The server shall use the concatenated AKA parameters (XRES||IK||CK)
   as a "password" when checking the HTTP Digest response or when
   calculating the "response-auth" of the "Authentication-Info" header.

4. Example Digest AKAv2 Operation

   This document does not introduce any changes to the operations of
   HTTP Digest or HTTP Digest AKA. Examples defined in [RFC3310] applies
   directly to AKAv2 with the following two exceptions:

   1.  The algorithm directive has a prefix "AKAv2" instead of "AKAv1".

   2.  The HTTP Digest password is derived from (RES||IK||CK) or
       (XRES||IK||CK) instead of (RES) or (XRES) respectively.

5. Security Considerations

5.1 Multiple Authentication Schemes and Algorithms

   The rules for an user agent for choosing among multiple
   authentication schemes and algorithms are as defined in [RFC3310]
   except that the user agent MUST choose "AKAv2" if both "AKAv1" and
   "AKAv2" are present.

   Since HTTP Digest is known to be vulnerable for bidding-down attack
   in environments where multiple authentication schemes and/or
   algorithms are used, the system implementators should pay special
   attention for scenarios where both "AKAv1" and "AKAv2" are used.
   Especially if the AKA generated sessions keys or some other
   additional security measures to authenticate the clients, such as
   client certificates, are not used, the use of both AKA algorithm
   versions should be avoided.

5.2 Session Protection

   Even though "AKAv2" uses the additional integrity (IK) and
   confidentiality (CK) keys as a part of HTTP Digest AKA password,
   these session keys may still be used for creating additional security
   within HTTP authentication or some other security mechanism. This
   recommendation is based on the assumption that algorithms used in
   HTTP Digest, such as MD5, are sufficiently strong one-way functions,
   and consequently HTTP Digest responses leak no or very little
   computational information about IK and CK.

5.3 Man-in-the-middle attacks

   [Asokan-Niemi-Nyberg] describe a "man-in-the-middle" attack related
   to tunnelled authentication protocols. [Asokan-Niemi-Nyberg] discuss
   the attack mostly in EAP context; however, it can exist in any
   similar contexts where tunnelled authentication is used and where the
   same authentication credentials are used without protection in some
   other context or the client fails to authenticate the server.

   For example, the use of TLS with HTTP Digest authentication (i.e. TLS
   for server authentication, and subsequent use of HTTP Digest for
   client authentication) is an instance of such scenario. HTTP
   challenges and responses can be fetched from and to different TLS
   tunnels without noticing where they originally came from. Especially,
   the attack is easy to perform if the client fails to authenticate the
   server. If the same HTTP credentials are used with unsecured
   connection, the attack is also easy to perform.

   This is how the "man-in-the-middle" attack works with HTTP Digest and

Internet-Draft             HTTP Digest AKAv2                   June 2003


   TLS if the victim (i.e. the client) fails to authenticate the server:

   1.  The victim contacts the attacker using TLS. If the attacker has a
       valid server certificate, the client may continue talking to the
       attacker and use some HTTP authentication compatible protocol,
       such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

   2.  The attacker contacts some real proxy/server also using TLS and
       some HTTP authentication compatible protocol. The proxy/server
       responds to the attacker with HTTP Authentication challenge.

   3.  The attacker forwards the HTTP Authentication challenge from the
       proxy/server to the victim. If the victim is not careful, and
       check that the identity in the server certificate in TLS matches
       the realm in the HTTP authentication challenge, it may send a new
       request which carries a valid response to the HTTP Authentication
       challenge.

   4.  The attacker may use the response with the victims HTTP Digest
       username and password to authenticate itself to the proxy/server.

   The man-in-the-middle attack is not possible if the client compares
   the identities in the TLS server certificate and the HTTP Digest
   authentication challenge. Note that with HTTP Basic, the client would
   send the password to the attacker.

   Another variant of the "man-in-the-middle" attack is the so-called
   "interleaving attack". This attack is possible if the HTTP Digest
   authentication credentials are used in several contexts, and in one
   of them without protection.

   This is how the attack could proceed:

   1.  The attacker establishes a TLS tunnel to the proxy/server using
       one-way server authentication. The attacker sends a request to
       the proxy/server.

   2.  The proxy/server challenges the attacker with HTTP Digest
       challenge.

   3.  The attacker challenges the victim in some other context using
       the challenge carried in the HTTP Digest challenge. The HTTP
       Digest challenge need to be modified to the format used in the
       protocol of this other context.

   4.  The victim responds with a response.

   5.  The attacker uses the response from the other context for

Internet-Draft             HTTP Digest AKAv2                   June 2003


       authentication in HTTP Digest.

   6.  The proxy/server accepts the response, and delivers the service
       to the attacker.

   In some circumstances, HTTP Digest AKAv1 may be vulnerable for the
   interleaving attack. In particular, if ISIM is implemented using USIM
   the HTTP Digest AKAv1 should not be used with tunneled security
   protocols unless the AKA related session keys, IK and CK, are somehow
   used with the solution.

   HTTP Digest AKAv2 is not vulnerable for interleaving attack.

5.4 Entropy

   AKAv1 passwords should only be used as one-time passwords if the
   entropy of the used RES value is limited (e.g., only 32 bits). For
   this reason, the reuse of the same RES value in authenticating
   subsequent requests and responses is not recommended. Furthermore,
   algorithms such as "MD5-sess", which limit the amount of material
   hashed with a single key, by producing a session key for
   authentication, should not be used with AKAv1.

   Passwords generated using AKAv2 can more securely be used for
   authenticating subsequent requests and responses because the
   concatenation of AKA credentials (i.e. RES||IK||CK) makes the
   passwords significantly longer. The user agent does not need to
   assume that AKAv2 passwords are limited to one-time use only, and it
   may try to re-use the AKAv2 passwords with the server. However, the
   length of the RES still matters because the attacker may try to use
   pre-calculated dictionaries to guess the (RES||IK||CK). The longer
   the RES is, the more difficult it is for the attacker to guess the
   (RES||IK||CK).
