1.  Introduction

   [RFC7725] was standardized by the IETF in February 2016.  It defined
   HTTP status code 451 - to be used when "a server operator has
   received a legal demand to deny access to a resource or to a set of
   resources".

   This document attempts to outline protocol recommendations that would
   help make the status code more useful to users.

2.  New Protocol Elements

2.1.  Blocking Authority

   An HTTP response with status code 451 should include a "Link" HTTP
   header field [RFC8288] which has a "rel" parameter whose value is
   "blocking-authority", in addition to the "blocked-by" header
   specified in [RFC7725].  It's important to distinguish between the
   implementer of the block, and the authority that mandated the block
   in the first place [ERRATA_ID-5181].  This is because these two
   organizations might not be the same - a government (the blocking
   authority) could force an Internet Service Provider (the implementer
   of the block) to deny access to a certain resource.  Both provide
   essential information about the legal block.

2.2.  Geographical Scope of Block

   HTTP status code 451 is increasingly being used to deny access to
   resources based on geographical location.  The response should
   contain a provisional header named "geo-scope-block" that specifies
   the countries in which a resource is blocked.  This scope should
   correspond to a comma-separated list of alpha-2 country codes defined
   in [ISO.3166-1].  The rationale for keeping the geographical scope to
   country-level granularity is that most blocks are mandated by
   national governments [IMPL_REPORT], [AUTOMATTIC_COUNTRY_BLOCK_LIST].

3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not add additional security considerations to
   [RFC7725].

4.  IANA Considerations

   The Link Relation Type Registry should be updated with the following
   entry:

   -  Relation Name: blocking-authority

   -  Description: Identifies the authority that has issued the block.

   -  Reference: this document

   In addition, IANA should be updated with the following provisional
   header:

   -  Header field name: geo-scope-block

   -  Applicable protocol: http

   -  Status: provisional

   -  Specification document(s): this document
