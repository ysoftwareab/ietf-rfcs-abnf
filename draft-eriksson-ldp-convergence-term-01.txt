   Abstract
   This document defines new terms for benchmarking of LDP convergence. 
   These terms are to be used in future methodology documents for 
   benchmarking LDP Convergence.  Existing BMWG terminology documents 
   such as IGP Convergence Benchmarking [3] provide useful terms for 
   LDP Convergence benchmarking. These terms are discussed in this 
   document.  Applicable terminology for MPLS and LDP defined in 
   MPLS WG RFCs [1] and [2] is also discussed.

   1. Introduction

   This draft describes the terminology for benchmarking LDP
   Convergence. An accompanying document describes the methodology for
   doing the benchmarking [TBD]. The main motivation for doing this work
   is the increased focus on lowering convergence time for LDP as an
   alternative to other solutions such as MPLS Fast Reroute.

   The purpose of this documents is to find existing terminology as well
   as define new terminology when needed terms are not available. The
   terminology will support the methodology that will be based on
   black-box testing of the LDP dataplane. The approach is very similar
   to the one found in [3] and [4].

3. Term Definitions


3.1 LDP Binding Table

   Definition:
      Table in which the LSR maintains all learned labels.  It consists
      of the prefix and label information bound to a peer's LDP
      identifier and the list of sent and received bindings/peer.

   Discussion:
      None

   Measurement Units:
      N/A

   Issues:
      None

   See Also:
      FEC Forwarding Table

3.2 FEC Forwarding Table

   Definition:
      Table in which the LSR maintains the next hop information for the
      particular FEC with the associated outgoing label and interface.
      It is used for setting up the FEC forwarding table is retrieved
      from the LIB entry.

   Discussion:
      None

   Measurement Units:
      N/A

   Issues:
      None

   See Also:
      LDP Binding Table

3.3 FEC Convergence Event

   Definition:
      The occurrence of a planned or unplanned action in the network
      that results in a change to an LSR's LDP next-hop forwarding.

   Discussion:
      Convergence Events include link loss, routing protocol session
      loss, router failure, and better next-hop.

Internet-Draft    Terminology for Benchmarking LDP Data Plane Convergence July 2004

   Measurement Units:
      N/A

   Issues:
      None

   See Also:
      FEC Forwarding Table Convergence
      FEC Convergence

3.4 FEC Forwarding Table Convergence

   Definition:
      Recovery from a change in the FEC Forwarding Table due to a FEC
      Convergence Event.

   Discussion:
      FEC Forwarding Table Convergence updates after the RIB and LDP
      Binding Table update due to a FECConvergence Event. FEC Forwarding
      Table Convergence can be observed externally by the rerouting of
      data Traffic to a new egress interface.

   Measurement Units:
      N/A

   Issues:
      None

   See Also:
      FEC Forwarding Table
      FEC Convergence Event
      FEC Convergence

3.5 FEC Convergence

   Definition:
      A change in the LDP Binding Table due to a FEC Convergence Event.

   Discussion:
      FEC Convergence is a change in an LDP Binding of a prefix and
      label to a peer's LDP Identifier.  This change can be an update or
      recovery due to a FEC Convergence Event. FEC Convergence is an LSR
      action made prior to FEC Forwarding Table Convergence.  FEC
      Convergence is not an externally observable Black-Box measurement.

   Measurement Units:
      N/A

   Issues:
      Where is LDP Identifier defined?  Where is LDP Binding defined?

3.6 Multiple Next-Hop FEC

   Definition:
      A FEC with more than one next-hop and associated outgoing label
      and interface.

   Discussion:
      A Multiple Next-Hop FEC can be verified from the FEC Forwarding
      Table and from externally observing traffic being forwarded to a
      FEC on one or more interfaces.

   Measurement Units:
      N/A

   Issues:
      None

   See Also:
      FEC Forwarding Table

3.7 Ingress LSR

   Definition:
      An MPLS ingress node which is capable of forwarding native L3
      packets.

   Discussion:
      None

   Measurement Units:
      N/A

   Issues:
      None

   See Also:
      MPLS Node
      MPLS Edge Node
      MPLS Egress Node

      packets.

   Discussion:
      None

   Measurement Units:
      N/A

4. Security Considerations

        Documents of this type do not directly effect the security of
        the Internet or of corporate networks as long as benchmarking
        is not performed on devices or systems connected to operating
        networks.
