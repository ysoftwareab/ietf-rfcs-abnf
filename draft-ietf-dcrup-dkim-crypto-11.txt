1.  Introduction

   Discussion Venue:    Discussion about this draft is directed to the
      dcrup@ietf.org [1] mailing list.

   DKIM [RFC6376] signs e-mail messages, by creating hashes of the
   message headers and body and signing the header hash with a digital
   signature.  Message recipients fetch the signature verification key
   from the DNS.  The defining documents specify a single signing
   algorithm, RSA [RFC3447].

   This document adds a new stronger signing algorithm, Edwards-Curve
   Digital Signature Algorithm using the Curve25519 curve (ed25519),
   which has much shorter keys than RSA for similar levels of security.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   Syntax descriptions use Augmented BNF (ABNF) [RFC5234].  The ABNF
   tokens sig-a-tag-k and key-k-tag-type are imported from [RFC6376].

3.  Ed25519-SHA256 Signing Algorithm

   The ed25519-sha256 signing algorithm computes a message hash as
   defined in section 3 of [RFC6376] using SHA-256 [FIPS-180-4-2015] as
   the hash-alg, and signs it with the PureEdDSA variant Ed25519, as
   defined in in RFC 8032 section 5.1 [RFC8032].  Example keys and
   signatures in Appendix A below are based on the test vectors in RFC
   8032 section 7.1 [RFC8032].

   The DNS record for the verification public key has a "k=ed25519" tag
   to indicate that the key is an Ed25519 rather than RSA key.

   This is an additional DKIM signature algorithm added to Section 3.3
   of [RFC6376] as envisioned in Section 3.3.4 of [RFC6376].

   Note: since Ed25519 keys are 256 bits long, the base64 encoded key is
   only 44 octets, so DNS key record data will generally fit in a single
   255 byte TXT string, and will work even with DNS provisioning
   software that doesn't handle multi-string TXT records.

4.  Signature and key syntax

   The syntax of DKIM signatures and DKIM keys are updated as follows.

4.1.  Signature syntax

   The syntax of DKIM algorithm tags in section 3.5 of [RFC6376] is
   updated by adding this rule to the existing rule for sig-a-tag-k:

       ABNF:

       sig-a-tag-k =/ "ed25519"

4.2.  Key syntax

   The syntax of DKIM key tags in section 3.6.1 of [RFC6376] is updated
   by adding this rule to the existing rule for key-k-tag-type:

       ABNF:

       key-k-tag-type  =/ "ed25519"

   The p= value in the key record is the ed25519 public key encoded in
   base64.  Since the key is 256 bits long, the base64 text is 44 octets
   long.  For example, a key record using the public key in [RFC8032]
   Section 7.1, Test 1, mignt be:

 s._domainkey.example TXT (
    "v=DKIM1; k=ed25519; p=11qYAYKxCrfVS/7TyWQHOg7hcvPapiMlrwIaaPcHURo="
    )

5.  Key and algorithm choice and strength

   Section 3.3 of [RFC6376] describes DKIM's hash and signature
   algorithms.  It is updated as follows:

   Signers SHOULD implement and verifiers MUST implement the
   ed25519-sha256 algorithm.

6.  Transition Considerations

   For backward compatibility, signers can add multiple signatures that
   use old and new signing algorithms.  Since there can only be a single
   key record in the DNS for each selector, the signatures have to use
   different selectors, although they can use the same d= and i=
   identifiers.

7.  Security Considerations

   Ed25519 is a widely used cryptographic technique, so the security of
   DKIM signatures using new signing algorithms should be at least as
   good as those using old algorithms.

   All of the security advice in [RFC6376] continues to apply except
   that the advice in Section 8 of [RFC8032] supplants the advice about
   RSA threats.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update registries as follows.

8.1.  DKIM Key Type registry

   The following value is added to the DKIM Key Type Registry

                     +---------+-----------+--------+
                     |   TYPE  | REFERENCE | STATUS |
                     +---------+-----------+--------+
                     | ed25519 | [RFC8032] | active |
                     +---------+-----------+--------+
