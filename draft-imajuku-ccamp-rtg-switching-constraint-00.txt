Abstract

   This document proposes routing extensions in support of carrying
   switching constraint information in corresponding link state
   information for Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS).
   With the proposed extension, GMPLS routing protocols can handle
   the network elements with some blocking constraints.

1.  Introduction

   The routing protocol extensions so far have been made for Generalized
   Multi-Protocol Switching (GMPLS)[OSPF-TE],[GMPLS-ROUTING],[GMPLS-OSPF].
   This document enhances the routing extensions required to support
   GMPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) over the network elements with blocking
   constraints.

   Reconfigurable optical add/drop Multiplexer (ROADM) is one of the 
   network element which employs the blocking switch architecture widely
   used in commercialized networks. The ROADM has switching constraints
   in the selectivity of direction when adding/dropping a lambda path 
   from/to a user network interface (UNI) port. The lambda path added 
   from each UNI port is restricted to either east or west bound of the
   ROADM ring. Similarly, the drop of lambda path to the UNI port also
   has constraint in the selectivity of the UNI port.

   The objective of this document is to enhance the routing protocol
   in support of carrying switching constraint information of the
   network elements with blocking constraints. The constraint
   information of each switch is carried within the link state
   information of Traffic Engineering (TE) links.

3.  Problem Statements

3.1.  Problem Statements

   Many lambda switch capable (LSC) nodes, such as ROADM and Optical
   Cross-Connects (OXC), employ blocking switch architecture to reduce
   the cost of switch fabric or wavelength converters. In particular,
   the ROADM, which has already been commercially deployed, employs
   unique switch architecture having constraint in TE link selectivity,
   while the OXC without the wavelength converters has constraint in
   wavelength label selectivity.

   For the constraint in wavelength label selectivity, GMPLS has
   specification to control the label allocation mechanism for
   Label Switch Paths (LSPs) based on signaling mechanism [RFC3471],
   [RFC3473]. To the contrary, for the constraint in TE link
   selectivity, there is no specification at this moment. 

   To combat with the issue of the constraint in TE link selectivity,
   it is obvious that an extension to GMPLS routing mechanism is
   essential for all network elements in a domain to understand which
   TE link can be selectable to forward LSPs at the network elements
   having the constraint.

3.2.  Example of Problem

   Figure shows an typical example of ROADM ring network to explain the
   constraint in TE link selectivity. Assuming that each ROADM switches
   optical signals (LSPs) transparently. The UNI ports of each ROADM 
   are grouped to ÅgwestÅh and ÅgeastÅh ports. In this network, a lambda
   LSP added from a UNI west port can not be dropped to a UNI ÅgwestÅh
   ports at other nodes, and it is also same in the case of vice versa.
   For example, a lambda LSP added from UNI port w1 of ROADM #1 can not
   be dropped to UNI port w1 or w2 of ROADM #2, #3 and #4. Similarly, a
   lambda LSP added from UNI port e1 of ROADM #1 can not be dropped to
   UNI port e1 or e2 of ROADM #2, #3 and #4.

3.3.  Comments on necessity of extension

   The problem statement described in the previous section is not
   so critical if the network is single ROADM ring network. In such case,
   the routing of LSPs can be performed based on static routing without
   using any routing protocols. 

   Employment of inter-domain routing architecture can also be one of
   solution. By separating ROADM rings from a GMPLS routing domain,
   the nodes outside ROADM domain assign ROADM node ID or boundary node
   adjacent to the ROADM domain with loose Explicit Route Object (ERO)
   to forward Lambda LSP. Then, each ROADM node perform loose hop
   expansion to forward the lambda LSP toward destination [RFC3209],
   [per-domain-calc].

   The case which essentially requires the extension to GMPLS routing
   mechanism is the case that the ROADM and other Lambda or Fiber
   Switch capable nodes co-exist in the same routing domain. Packet
   and TDM switch capable nodes attached to such domain also required
   to consider the constraint in TE link selectivity at the ROADM nodes
   when creating the Lambda LSP.

4.  Proposal for GMPLS Routing Enhancement

   This section proposes a possible solution to advertise the constraint
   in TE link selectivity. The extended sub-TLVs are indicates the list
   of selectable and/or unselectable TE links from the TE link
   indicated in sub-TLV Type 2 (Link ID).

   The possible extensions to sub-TLV are described:

   Sub-TLV Type      Length    Name
            TBD    variable    Selectable numbered TE link list
            TBD    variable    Unselectable numberd TE link list
            TBD    variable    Selectable unnumberd TE link list
            TBD    variable    Unselectable unnumberd TE link list

5.  Compatibility Issues

   There should be no interoperability issues with routers that do not
   implement these extensions, as the Opaque LSAs will be silently
   ignored.

   The result of having routers that do not implement these extensions
   is that the traffic engineering topology will be missing pieces.
   However, if the topology is connected, TE paths can still be
   calculated and ought to work.
