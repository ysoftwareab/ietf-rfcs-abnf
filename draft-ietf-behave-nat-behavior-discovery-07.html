Applicability</h3>

<p>This experimental NAT Behavior Discovery STUN usage provides
      information about a NAT device's observable transient behavior; it
      determines a NAT's behavior with regard to the STUN server used and the
      particular client ports used at the instant the test is run. This STUN
      usage does not allow an application behind a NAT to make an absolute
      determination of the NAT&rsquo;s characteristics. NAT devices do not
      behave consistently enough to predict future behaviour with any
      guarantee. Applications requiring reliable reach between two particular
      endpoints must establish a communication channel through NAT using
      another technique. IETF has proposed standards including <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>ICE<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice] and <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sip-outbound'>OUTBOUND<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jennings, C., &ldquo;Managing Client Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol  (SIP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sip&#8209;outbound] for establishing
      communication channels when a publicly accessible rendezvous service is
      available.
</p>
<p>The primary uses envisioned for the STUN attributes included in this
      draft are diagnostics and real-time tuning of applications. The
      techniques possible with this usage are powerful diagnostic tools in the
      hands of a network administrator or system programmer trying to
      determine the causes of network failure; particularly when behavior
      varies by load, destination, or other factors that may be related to NAT
      behavior.
</p>
<p>This draft also proposes experimental usage of these attributes for
      real-time optimization of parameters for protocols in situations where a
      publicly accessible rendezvous service is not available. Such a use of
      these techniques is only possible when the results are applied as an
      optimization and a reliable fallback is available in case the NAT's
      behavior becomes more restrictive than determined by the Behavior
      Discovery tests. One possible application is role selection in P2P
      networks based on statistical experience with establishing direct
      connections and diagnosing NAT behavior with a variety of peers. The
      experimental question is whether such a test is useful. If a node trying
      to join an overlay as a full peer when its NAT prevents sufficient
      connectivity and then withdrawing is expensive or leads to unreliable or
      poorly performing operation, then even if the behavior discovery check
      is only "correct" 75% of the time, its relative cheapness may make it
      very useful for optimizing the behavior of the overlay network. Section
      <a class='info' href='#secP2PExperiment'>2.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example Use with P2P Overlays</span><span>)</span></a> describes this
      experimental application in more detail and discusses how to evaluate
      its success or failure.
</p>
<p>The applications of this STUN usage are very different than the
      original use of <a class='info' href='#RFC3489'>RFC3489<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Weinberger, J., Huitema, C., and R. Mahy, &ldquo;STUN - Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Through Network Address Translators (NATs),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3489], which was
      intended for static determination of device behavior. The NAT Behavior
      Discovery STUN usage makes an explicit statement that it is not, and
      cannot be, correct 100% of the time, but is still very useful. More
      generally, one of the important differences between 3489 and ICE is that
      ICE ensures there is always a fallback to TURN, and thus avoids the
      problem experienced by 3489-based applications that tried to determine
      in advance whether they would need a relay and what their peer reflexive
      address will be, which are both impossible. This STUN usage requires an
      application using it to have a fallback, but unlike ICE's focus on the
      problems inherent in VoIP sessions, doesn't assume that it will only be
      used to establish a connection between a single pair of machines, and so
      alternative fallback mechanisms may make sense. For example, in a P2P
      application it may be possible to simply switch out of the role where
      such connections need to be established or to select an alternative
      indirect route if the peer discovers that, in practice, 10% of its
      connection attempts fail.
</p>
<p>It is submitted to the Internet community as an experimental protocol
      that, when applied with appropriate statistical underpinnings and
      application behavior that is ultimately based on experienced
      connectivity patterns, can lead to more stability and increased
      performance than is available without the knowledge it provides.
</p>
<p>If a draft specifies the use of any portion of this STUN usage, that
      draft MUST document how incorrect information derived using these
      methods will be managed, either through identifying when a NAT's
      behavior changed or because the protocol uses such knowledge as an
      optimization but remains functional when the NAT's behavior changes.

Introduction</h3>

<p>The <a class='info' href='#RFC5389'>Simple Traversal Underneath Network
      Address Translators (STUN)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Mahy, R., Matthews, P., and D. Wing, &ldquo;Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN),&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5389] provides a mechanism to discover the
      reflexive transport address toward the STUN server, using the Binding
      Request. This specification defines the NAT Behavior Discovery STUN
      usage, which allows a STUN client to probe the current behaviour of the
      NAT/FW devices between the client and the STUN server. This usage
      defines new STUN attributes for the Binding Request and Binding
      Response.
</p>
<p>Many NAT/FW devices do not behave consistently and will change their
      behaviour under load and over time. Applications requiring high
      reliability must be prepared for the NAT's behaviour to become more
      restrictive. Specifically, it has been found that under load NATs may
      transition to the most restrictive filtering and mapping behaviour and
      shorten the lifetime of new and existing bindings. In short,
      applications can discover how bad things currently are, but not how bad
      things will get.
</p>
<p>Despite this limitation, instantaneous observations are often quite
      useful in troubleshooting network problems, and repeated tests over
      time, or in known load situations, may be used to characterize a NAT's
      behavior. In particular, in the hands of a person knowledgeable about
      the needs of an application and the nodes an application needs to
      communicate with, it can be a powerful tool.

Example Diagnostic Use</h3>

<p>Applications that work well in the lab, but fail in a deployment,
        are notoriously common within distributed systems. There are few
        systems developers who have not had the experience of searching to
        determine the difference in the environments for insight as to what
        real-network behavior was missed in the testing lab. The behavior
        discovery usage offers a powerful tool that can be used to check NAT
        and firewall behavior as the application is running. For example, an
        application could be designed to perform Behavior Discovery tests
        whenever it experiences significant communications problems when
        running. Such analysis might be included as part of the diagnostic
        information logged by the application.
</p>
<p>As they are being used to detect instantaneous behavior for
        analysis by an experienced developer or administrator, there are
        relatively few concerns about this application of the NAT Behavior
        Discovery STUN usage. However, the user should be aware that
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>adding new traffic to new destinations (STUN servers) has the
            potential to itself change the behavior of a NAT and
</li>
<li>the user must be careful to select a STUN server that is
            appropriately located, ideally collocated (or even integrated)
            with the communication partners of the application in question,
            for the results to be applicable to the network conditions
            experienced by the application.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
Example Use with P2P Overlays</h3>

<p>An application could use Behavior Discovery in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
        protocol to determine if a particular endpoint is a reasonable
        candidate to participate as a peer or supernode (defined here as a
        peer in the overlay that offers services, including message routing,
        to other members or clients of the overlay network). This P2P network
        application is willing to select supernodes that might be located
        behind NATs to avoid the cost of dedicated servers. A supernode
        candidate requires that its NAT(s) offer(s) Endpoint-Independent
        Filtering. It might periodically re-run tests and would remove itself
        as a supernode if its NAT/FW chain lost this characteristic. These
        tests could be run with other supernodes acting as STUN servers as
        well as with dedicated STUN servers. As many P2P algorithms tolerate
        non-transitive connectivity between a portion of their peers,
        guaranteed pair-wise reliable reach might be sacrificed in order to
        distribute the P2P overlay's load across peers that can be directly
        contacted by the majority of users.
</p>
<p>Consider an example from a hypothetical P2P protocol in more
        detail: When P2P node A starts up, it tests its NAT(s) relative to
        other peers already in the overlay. If the results of its testing
        indicate A is behind a "good" NAT (with endpoint-independent mapping
        and filtering), A will join the overlay and establish connections with
        appropriate peers in the overlay to join the overlay's topology.
        Although A is reachable by routing messages across the overlay
        topology, A will also include in its communication with other nodes
        that they may reach it directly using its reflexive IP address (or
        addresses) that A discovered in its initial testing. Suppose that
        later, node B wants to send a message to A, and B is not a neighbor of
        A in the overlay topology. B may send the message directly to A's IP
        address and start a timer. If B doesn't receive a response within a
        certain amount of time, then it routes the message to A across the
        overlay instead and includes a flag that indicates a direct connection
        was attempted but failed. (Alternatively, B could simultaneously send
        the message to A's IP address and across the overlay, which guarantees
        minimum response latency, but can waste bandwidth.) A over time
        observes the percentage of successful direct messages it receives out
        of those attempted. If the percentage of successful direct connections
        is below some threshold (perhaps 75%), then A may stop advertising for
        direct connections because it has determined in practice that its NATs
        are not providing sufficiently reliable connectivity to justify the
        cost of attempting the direct message. But if the percentage is high
        enough, A continues to advertise because the successful direct
        connections are improving the overlay's performance by reducing the
        routing load imposed on the overlay. If at some point, A's NAT(s)
        changes behavior, A will notice a change in its percentage of
        successful direct connections and may re-evaluate its decision to
        advertise a public address. In this hypothetical example, Behavior
        Discovery is used for A's initial operating mode selection, but the
        actual decision for whether to continue advertising that public
        IP/port pair is made based on actual operating data. The results of
        the behavior-discovery usage are also used as a performance
        optimization, as A is at all times able to establish connectivity
        through the overlay if the attempted direct connection fails.
</p>
<p>Use of Behavior Discovery for such an
        application requires:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Use of a protocol capable of offering reliable end-user
            performance using unreliable links between peers.
</li>
<li>A protocol offering a reliable fallback to connections
            attempted based on the results of Behavior Discovery probing.
</li>
<li>The application is deployed behind NATs that provide
            Endpoint-Independent Filtering and that remain in this mode for an
            amount of time sufficient for the application to identify their
            behavior, distribute this information to the rest of the overlay,
            and provide useful work for the application.
</li>
</ul>

<p>This draft is experimental as applications implementing open
        protocols have yet to be deployed in such environments to demonstrate
        that these two requirements have been met. However, anecdotal evidence
        suggests that NATs targeted at households and small businesses have
        stable behaviour, especially when there are few clients behind them.
        Numerous P2P applications have been deployed that appear to have these
        properties, although their protocols have not yet been subjected to
        rigorous evaluation by standards bodies.

Experimental Success</h3>

<p>The criteria for an application to successfully demonstrate use of
        the NAT Behavior Discovery STUN usage would include:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>An implementation that relies on this usage to determine its
            run-time behavior, most likely using it to determine an initial
            choice of options that are then adjusted based on experience with
            its network connections.
</li>
<li>The implementation must either demonstrate its applicability in
            environments where it is realistic to expect a provider to deploy
            dedicated STUN servers with multiple IP addresses, or it must
            demonstrate duplicating the behavior of such a dedicated STUN
            server with two nodes that share the role of providing the
            address-changing operations required by this usage.
</li>
<li>Experimental evidence that the application of this usage
            results in improved behavior of the application in real-world
            conditions. The exact metrics for this improvement may vary, some
            possibilities include: faster convergence to the proper
            parameters, less work to set up initial connections, fewer
            reconfigurations required after startup, etc.
</li>
<li>A protocol specification that defines how the implementation
            applies this usage.
</li>
</ul><p>The P2P scenario described above is a likely experimental
        test case for this usage, but others applications are possible as
        well.

Overview of Operations</h3>

<p>In a typical configuration, a STUN client is connected to a private
      network and through one or more NATs to the public Internet. The client
      is configured with the address of a STUN server on the public Internet.
      The Behavior Discovery usage makes use of SRV records so that a server
      may use a different transport address for this usage than for other
      usages. This usage does not provide backward compatibility with <a class='info' href='#RFC3489'>RFC3489<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Weinberger, J., Huitema, C., and R. Mahy, &ldquo;STUN - Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Through Network Address Translators (NATs),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3489] for either clients or servers.
      Implementors of clients that wish to be compliant with RFC3489 servers
      should see that specification. Implementors of servers SHOULD NOT
      include support for RFC3489 clients as the original uses of that
      protocol have been deprecated.
</p>
<p>Because the STUN forbids a server from creating a new TCP or TCP/TLS
      connection to the client, many tests apply only to UDP. The
      applicability of the various tests is indicated below.
</p>
<p>The STUN NAT Behavior Discovery usage defines new attributes on the
      STUN Binding Request and STUN Binding Response that allow these messages
      to be used to diagnose the current behavior of the NAT(s) between the
      client and server.
</p>
<p>This section provides a descriptive overview of the typical use of
      these attributes. Normative behavior is described in Sections <a class='info' href='#secClient'>5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Client Behavior</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#secServer'>6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Server Behavior</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#secAttrib'>7<span> (</span><span class='info'>New Attributes</span><span>)</span></a>, and <a class='info' href='#secResponse'>8<span> (</span><span class='info'>New Response Codes</span><span>)</span></a> .

Determining NAT Mapping</h3>

<p>A client behind a NAT wishes to determine if the NAT it is behind
        is currently using endpoint-independent, address-dependent, or address
        and port-dependent mapping<a class='info' href='#RFC4787'>[RFC4787]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audet, F. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. The client

        attribute; these tests are described in detail in <a class='info' href='#sec-disc-tests'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Discovery Process</span><span>)</span></a>. These tests send
        binding requests to the alternate address and port of the STUN server
        to determine mapping behaviour. These tests can be used for UDP, TCP,
        or TCP/TLS connections.

Determining NAT Filtering</h3>

<p>A client behind a NAT wishes to determine if the NAT it is behind
        is currently using endpoint-independent, address-dependent, or address
        and port-dependent filtering<a class='info' href='#RFC4787'>[RFC4787]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audet, F. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. The client
        performs a series of tests that make use of the OTHER-ADDRESS and
        CHANGE-REQUEST attributes; these tests are described in <a class='info' href='#sec-disc-tests'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Discovery Process</span><span>)</span></a>. These tests request
        responses from the alternate address and port of the STUN server; a
        precondition to these tests is that no binding be established to the
        alternate address and port. See below for more information. Because
        the NAT does not know that the alternate address and port belong to
        the same server as the primary address and port, it treats these
        responses the same as it would those from any other host on the
        Internet. Therefore, the success of the binding responses sent from
        the alternate address and port indicate whether the NAT is currently
        performing endpoint-independent filtering, address-dependent
        filtering, or address and port-dependent filtering. This test applies
        only to UDP datagrams.

<a name="rfc.section.3.3"></a><h3>3.3.&nbsp;
Binding Lifetime Discovery</h3>

<p>Many systems, such as VoIP, rely on being able to keep a connection
        open between a client and server or between peers of a P2P system.
        Because NAT bindings expire over time, keepalive messages must be sent
        across the connection to preserve it. Because keepalives impose some
        overhead on the network and servers, reducing the frequency of
        keepalives can be useful.
</p>
<p>A normal request-response protocol cannot be used to test binding
        lifetime because the initial request resets the binding timer.
        Behavior Discover defines the XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET attribute to allow
        the client and server to set up a "control channel" using one port on
        the client that is used to test the binding lifetime of a different
        port allocated on the client. More generally, XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET
        allows the client to allocate two ports and request that responses to
        queries sent from one port be delivered to the other. The client uses
        its second port and the STUN server's alternate address to check if an
        existing binding that hasn't had traffic sent on it is still open
        after time T. This approach is described in detail in <a class='info' href='#sec-binding-desc'>Section&nbsp;4.6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Binding Lifetime Discovery</span><span>)</span></a>. This test applies only to UDP
        datagrams.

Diagnosing NAT Hairpinning</h3>

<p>STUN Binding Requests allow a client to determine whether it is
        behind a NAT that supports hairpinning of connections. To perform this
        test, the client first sends a Binding Request to its STUN server to
        determine its mapped address. The client then sends a STUN Binding
        Request to this mapped address from a different port. If the client
        receives its own request, the NAT hairpins connections. This test
        applies to UDP, TCP, or TCP/TLS connections.

<a name="rfc.section.3.5"></a><h3>3.5.&nbsp;
Determining Fragment Handling</h3>

<p>Some NATs exhibit different behavior when forwarding fragments than
        when forwarding a single-frame datagram. In particular, some NATs do
        not hairpin fragments at all and some platforms discard fragments
        under load. To diagnose this behavior, STUN messages may be sent with
        the PADDING attribute, which simply inserts additional space into the
        message. By forcing the STUN message to be divided into multiple
        fragments, the NAT's behavior can be observed.
</p>
<p>All of the previous tests can be performed with PADDING if a NAT's
        fragment behavior is important for an application, or only those tests
        which are most interesting to the application can be retested. PADDING
        only applies to UDP datagrams. PADDING can not be used with
        XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET.

Detecting Generic ALGs</h3>

<p>A number of NAT boxes are now being deployed into the market which
        try to provide "generic" ALG functionality. These generic ALGs hunt
        for IP addresses, either in text or binary form within a packet, and
        rewrite them if they match a binding. This behavior can be detected
        because the STUN server returns both the MAPPED-ADDRESS and
        XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS in the same response. If the result in the two does
        not match, there is a NAT with a generic ALG in the path. This test
        apples to UDP and TCP, but not TLS over TCP connections.

Discovery Process</h3>

<p>This section provides a descriptive overview of how the NAT Behavior
      Discovery usage primitives allow checks to be made to discover the
      current behaviour of the NAT or NATs an application is behind. These
      tests can only give the instantaneous behaviour of a NAT; it has been
      found that NATs can change behaviour under load and over time. The
      results of these tests therefore can be regarded as upper bounds---an
      application must assume that NAT behaviour can become more restrictive
      at any time. Results from tests performed using a particular port on the
      client may also not indicate the behavior experienced by a different
      port, as described in<a class='info' href='#sec-source-port'>Section&nbsp;4.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Source Port Selection</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Definitions for NAT filtering and mapping behaviour are from <a class='info' href='#RFC4787'>[RFC4787]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audet, F. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. The tests described here are for UDP
      connectivity, NAT mapping behaviour, NAT filtering behaviour, and NAT
      binding lifetime discovery; additional tests could be designed using
      this usage's mechanisms. The tests described below include only tests
      that can be performed using a client with a single IP address. A client
      with multiple IP addresses (or multiple clients collaborating) behind
      the same NAT can combine their probes to test additional aspects of NAT
      behavior, such as port overloading. This section provides a descriptive
      overview of how the primitives provided by the STUN attributes in this
      specification may be used to perform behavior tests.

Source Port Selection</h3>

<p>Proper source port selection is important to ensuring the
        usefulness and accuracy of the Behavior Discovery tests. There are two
        preconditions for tests:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Because mapping behavior can vary on a port-by-port basis, an
            application should perform its tests using the source port
            intended for use by the application whenever possible. If it
            intends to use multiple source ports, it should repeat these tests
            for each source port. Such tests should be performed sequentially
            to reduce load on the NAT.
</li>
<li>Because the results of some diagnostic checks depend on
            previous state in the NAT created by prior traffic, the tests
            should be performed using a source port that has not generated
            recent traffic. Therefore the application should use a random
            source port or ensure that no traffic has previously occurred on
            the selected port prior to performing tests, generally by
            allocating a port and holding it unused for at least 15 minutes
            prior to the tests.
</li>
</ul><p>Ensuring both of these preconditions can be challenging,
        particularly for a device or application wishing to perform Behavior
        Discovery tests at startup. The following guidelines are suggested for
        reducing the likelihood of problems:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>An application intended to operate behind a NAT should not
            attempt to allocate a specific or well-known port. Because such
            software must be designed to interoperate using whatever port is
            mapped to it by the NAT, the specific port is unnecessary.
            Instead, on startup a random port should be selected (see below
            for recommended ranges). An application, particularly on an
            embedded device, should not rely on the host operating system to
            select the next available port, because that might result in the
            application receiving the same port on each restart. An
            application using the same port between restarts may not receive
            accurate results from Behavior Discovery tests that are intended
            to test state-related behavior of NATs, such as filtering and
            binding lifetime.
</li>
<li>An application requiring multiple ports, such as separate ports
            for control and media, should allocate those ports on startup when
            possible. Even if there is no immediate need for media flow, if
            Behavior Discovery tests will be run on those ports, allocating
            them early will allow them to be left idle, increasing the chance
            of obtaining accurate results from Behavior Discovery tests.
</li>
<li>Although the most reliable results are obtained when performing
            tests with the specific ports that the application will use, in
            many cases an application will need to allocate and use ports
            without being able to perform complete Behavior Discovery tests on
            those ports. In those cases, an application should randomly select
            its ports from a range likely to receive the same treatment by the
            NAT. This document recommends ranges of 32768-49151, which is the
            upper end of IANA's Registered Ports range, and 49152-65535, which
            is IANA's Dynamic and/or Private port range, for random selection.
            To attempt to characterize a NAT's general treatment of ports in
            these ranges, a small number of ports within a range can be
            randomly selected and characterized.

Determining NAT Mapping Behavior</h3>

<p>This will require at most three tests. In test I, the client
        performs the UDP connectivity test. The server will return its
        alternate address and port in OTHER-ADDRESS in the binding response.
        If OTHER-ADDRESS is not returned, the server does not support this
        usage and this test cannot be run. The client examines the
        XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute. If this address and port are the same as
        the local IP address and port of the socket used to send the request,
        the client knows that it is not NATed and the effective mapping will
        be Endpoint-Independent.
</p>
<p>In test II, the client sends a Binding Request to the alternate
        address, but primary port. If the XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS in the Binding
        Response is the same as test I the NAT currently has
        Endpoint-Independent Mapping. If not, test III is performed: the
        client sends a Binding Request to the alternate address and port. If
        the XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS matches test II, the NAT currently has
        Address-Dependent Mapping; if it doesn't match it currently has
        Address and Port-Dependent Mapping.

Determining NAT Filtering Behavior</h3>

<p>This will also require at most three tests. These tests are
        sensitive to prior state on the NAT.
</p>
<p>In test I, the client performs the UDP connectivity test. The
        server will return its alternate address and port in OTHER-ADDRESS in
        the binding response. If OTHER-ADDRESS is not returned, the server
        does not support this usage and this test cannot be run.
</p>
<p>In test II, the client sends a binding request to the primary
        address of the server with the CHANGE-REQUEST attribute set to
        change-port and change-IP. This will cause the server to send its
        response from its alternate IP address and alternate port. If the
        client receives a response the current behaviour of the NAT is
        Endpoint-Independent Filtering.
</p>
<p>If no response is received, test III must be performed to
        distinguish between Address-Dependent Filtering and Address and
        Port-Dependent Filtering. In test III, the client sends a binding
        request to the original server address with CHANGE-REQUEST set to
        change-port. If the client receives a response the current behaviour
        is Address-Dependent Filtering; if no response is received the current
        behaviour is Address and Port-Dependent Filtering.

Combining and Ordering Tests</h3>

<p>Clients may wish to combine and parallelize these tests to reduce
        the number of packets sent and speed the discovery process. For
        example, test I of the filtering and mapping tests also checks if UDP
        is blocked. Furthermore, an application or user may not need as much
        detail as these sample tests provide. For example, establishing
        connectivity between nodes becomes significantly more difficult if a
        NAT has any behavior other than endpoint-independent mapping, which
        requires only test I and II of <a class='info' href='#secNatMapping'>Section&nbsp;4.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Determining NAT Mapping Behavior</span><span>)</span></a>.
        An application determining its NAT does not always provide independent
        mapping might notify the user if no relay is configured, whereas an
        application behind a NAT that provides endpoint-independent mapping
        might not notify the user until a subsequent connection actually fails
        or might provide a less urgent notification that no relay is
        configured. Such a test does not alleviate the need for <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>ICE<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice], but it does provide some
        information regarding whether ICE is likely to be successful
        establishing non-relayed connections.
</p>
<p>Care must be taken when combining and parallelizing tests, due to
        the sensitivity of certain tests to prior state on the NAT and because
        some NAT devices have an upper limit on how quickly bindings will be
        allocated. Section <a class='info' href='#secClient'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Client Behavior</span><span>)</span></a> restricts the rate

Binding Lifetime Discovery</h3>

<p>STUN can also be used to probe the lifetimes of the bindings
        created by the NAT. Such tests are sensitive to prior state on the
        NAT. For many NAT devices, an absolute refresh interval cannot be
        determined; bindings might be closed quicker under heavy load or might
        not behave as the tests suggest. For this reason applications that
        require reliable bindings must send keep-alives as frequently as
        required by all NAT devices that will be encountered. Suggested
        refresh intervals are outside the scope of this document. <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>ICE<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice] and <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sip-outbound'>OUTBOUND<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jennings, C., &ldquo;Managing Client Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol  (SIP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sip&#8209;outbound] have suggested refresh
        intervals.
</p>
<p>Determining the binding lifetime relies on two separate source
        ports being used to send STUN Binding Requests to the STUN server. The
        general approach is that the client uses a source port X to send a
        single Binding Request. After a period of time during which source
        port X is not used, the client uses a second source port Y to send a
        Binding Request to the STUN server that indicates the response should
        be sent to the binding established to port X. If the binding for port
        X has timed out, that response will not be received. By varying the
        time between the original Binding Request sent from X and the
        subsequent request sent from Y, the client can determine the binding
        lifetime.
</p>
<p>To determine the binding lifetime, the client first sends a Binding
        Request to the server from a particular source port, X. This creates a
        binding in the NAT. The response from the server contains a
        MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute, providing the public address and port on the
        NAT. Call this Pa and Pp, respectively. The client then starts a timer
        with a value of T seconds. When this timer fires, the client sends
        another Binding Request to the server, using the same destination
        address and port, but from a different source port, Y. This request
        contains an XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET address attribute, set to (Pa,Pp), to
        request the response be delivered to (Pa,Pp). This will create a new
        binding on the NAT, and cause the STUN server to send a Binding
        Response that would match the old binding, (Pa,Pp), if it still
        exists. If the client receives the Binding Response on port X, it
        knows that the binding has not expired. If the client receives the
        Binding Response on port Y (which is possible if the old binding
        expired, and the NAT allocated the same public address and port to the
        new binding), or receives no response at all, it knows that the
        binding has expired.
</p>
<p>Because some NATs only refresh bindings when outbound traffic is
        sent, the client must resend a binding request from the original
        source port before beginning a second test with a different value of
        T. The client can find the value of the binding lifetime by doing a
        binary search through T, arriving eventually at the value where the
        response is not received for any timer greater than T, but is received
        for any timer less than T. Note also that the binding refresh behavior
        (outbound only or all traffic) can be determined by sending multiple
        Binding Requests from port Y without refreshes from the original
        source port X.
</p>
<p>This discovery process takes quite a bit of time and is something
        that will typically be run in the background on a device once it
        boots.
</p>
<p>It is possible that the client can get inconsistent results each
        time this process is run. For example, if the NAT should reboot, or be
        reset for some reason, the process may discover a lifetime than is
        shorter than the actual one. Binding lifetime may also be dependent on
        the traffic load on the NAT. For this reason, implementations are
        encouraged to run the test numerous times and be prepared to get
        inconsistent results.
</p>
<p>Like the other diagnostics, this test is inherently unstable. In
        particular, an overloaded NAT might reduce binding lifetime to shed
        load. A client might find this diagnostic useful at startup, for
        example setting the initial keepalive interval on its connection to
        the server to 10 seconds while beginning this check. After determining
        the current lifetime, the keepalive interval used by the connection to
        the server can be set to this appropriate value. Subsequent checks of
        the binding lifetime can then be performed using the keepalives in the
        server connection. The STUN Keepalive Usage <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sip-outbound'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sip&#8209;outbound]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jennings, C., &ldquo;Managing Client Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol  (SIP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> provides a response that
        confirms the connection is open and allows the client to check that
        its mapped address has not changed. As that provides both the
        keepalive action and diagnostic that it is working, it should be
        preferred over any attempt to characterize the connection by a
        secondary technique.

Client Behavior</h3>

</p>
<p>If a client intends to utilize an XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET attribute in
      future transactions, as described in <a class='info' href='#sec-binding-desc'>Section&nbsp;4.6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Binding Lifetime Discovery</span><span>)</span></a>, then it MUST include a CACHE-TIMEOUT
      attribute in the Request with the value set greater than the longest
      time duration it intends to test. The server will also include this
      attribute in its Response, modified with its estimate of how long it
      will be able to cache this connection. Because the returned value is
      only an estimate, the client must be prepared for the value to be wrong,
      and therefore to receive a 481 response to its subsequent Requests with
      XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET.
</p>
<p>Support for XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET is optional due to the state cost on
      the server. Therefore, a client MUST be prepared to receive a 420
      (Unknown Attribute) error to requests that include XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET
      or CACHE-TIMEOUT. Support for OTHER-ADDRESS and CHANGE-REQUEST is
      optional, but MUST be supported by servers advertised via SRV, as
      described below. This is to allow the use of PADDING and
      XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET in applications where servers do not have multiple
      IP addresses. Clients MUST be prepared to receive a 420 for requests
      that include CHANGE-REQUEST when OTHER-ADDRESS was not received in
      Binding Response messages from the server.
</p>
<p>If an application makes use of the NAT Behavior Discovery STUN usage
      by multiplexing it in a flow with application traffic, a FINGERPRINT
      attribute SHOULD be included unless it is always possible to distinguish
      a STUN message from an application message based on their header.
</p>
<p>When PADDING is used, it SHOULD be equal to the MTU of the outgoing
      interface.
</p>
<p>Clients SHOULD ignore an ALTERNATE-SERVER attribute in a response
      unless they are using authentication with a provider of STUN servers
      that is aware of the topology requirements of the tests being
      performed.
</p>
<p>A client SHOULD NOT generate more than ten new STUN transactions per
      second and SHOULD pace them such that the RTOs do not synchronize the
      retransmissions of each transaction.

<p>Unless the user or application is aware of the transport address of
        a STUN server supporting the NAT Behavior Discovery usage through
        other means, a client is configured with the domain name of the
        provider of the STUN servers. The domain is resolved to a transport
        address using SRV procedures <a class='info' href='#RFC2782'>[RFC2782]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gulbrandsen, A., Vixie, P., and L. Esibov, &ldquo;A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>. The

        servers or of acquiring a specific transport address is out of scope
        for this document.
</p>
<p>For the Behavior Discovery Usage the service name is
        "stun-behavior" for UDP and TCP. The service name is "stun-behaviors"
        for TLS over TCP. Only "tcp" is defined as a protocol for

<p>Servers MAY require authentication before allowing a client to make
        use of its services. This is particularly important to requests used
        to perform a Binding Lifetime Discovery test or other test requiring
        use of the XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET attribute. The method for obtaining
        these credentials, should the server require them, is outside the
        scope of this usage. Presumably, the administrator or application
        relying on this usage should have its own method for obtaining
        credentials. If the client receives a 401 (Unauthorized) Response to a
        Request, then it must either acquire the appropriate credential from
        the application before retrying or report a permanent failure.

      datagrams using the same ports on each IP address (normally a wildcard
      binding accomplishes this). TCP and TCP/TLS MUST use different ports. If
      a server cannot allocate the same ports on two different IP address,
      then it MUST NOT include an OTHER-ADDRESS attribute in any Response and
      MUST respond with a 420 (Unknown Attribute) to any Request with a

<a name="rfc.section.6.1"></a><h3>6.1.&nbsp;
Preparing the Response</h3>

<p>After performing all authentication and verification steps the
        server begins processing specific to this Usage if the Request
        contains any request attributes defined in this document:
        XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET, CHANGE-REQUEST, CACHE-TIMEOUT, or PADDING. If the
        Request does not contain any attributes from this document,
        OTHER-ADDRESS and RESPONSE-ORIGIN are still included in the
        response.
</p>
<p>The server MUST include both MAPPED-ADDRESS and XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS
        in its Response.
</p>
<p>If the Request contains CHANGE-REQUEST attribute and the server
        does not have an alternate address and port as described above, the
        server MUST generate an error response of type 420.
</p>
<p>If the Request contains a CACHE-TIMEOUT attribute, then the server
        SHOULD include a CACHE-TIMEOUT attribute in its response indicating
        the duration (in seconds) it anticipates being able to cache this
        binding request in anticipation of a future Request using the
        XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET attribute. The CACHE-TIMEOUT response value can be
        greater or less than the value in the request. If the server is not
        prepared to provide such an estimate, it SHOULD NOT include the
        CACHE-TIMEOUT attribute in its Response. The server SHOULD NOT provide
        a CACHE-TIMEOUT length longer than the amount of time it has been able
        to cache recent requests.
</p>
<p>If XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET is included in a Request, then the server
        MUST verify that it has previously received a binding request with
        CACHE-TIMEOUT from the same address as is specified in
        XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET. If it has not, or if sufficient time has passed
        that it no longer has a record of having received such a request due
        to limited state, it MUST respond with an error response of type
        481.
</p>
<p>If the Request contains a XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET attribute and the
        server is authenticating such requests, then the server checks the
        message for a MESSAGE-INTEGRITY attribute and a USERNAME. If they are
        not present the server MUST generate an error response of type
        401.
</p>
<p>Because XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET offers the potential for minor
        indirection attacks, a server MUST either authenticate the users
        requesting its use or rate-limit its response to those requests, in
        addition to verifying that it previously received a binding request
        from that address. Rate-limiting is RECOMMENDED even for responses to
        authenticated requests unless the server is deployed for an
        application that requires more frequent responses. If the Request
        contains a XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET attribute and the server is
        rate-limiting such requests, it MUST ensure that it does not generate
        a Response on a particular address more often than one per second. If
        the server receives requests whose responses are being rate-limited
        more often than one per second, it MUST generate a 503 (Service
        unavailable) Response to the Request.
</p>
<p>The source address and port of the Binding Response depend on the
        value of the CHANGE-REQUEST attribute and on the address and port the
        Binding Request was received on, and are summarized in <a class='info' href='#oatable'>Table&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Impact of Flags on Packet Source and OTHER-ADDRESS</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Let A1 and A2 be the two IP addresses used by the server and P1 and
        P2 be the ports used by the server. Let Da represent the destination
        IP address of the Binding Request (which will be either A1 or A2), and
        Dp represent the destination port of the Binding Request (which will
        be either P1 or P2). Let Ca represent the other address, so that if Da
        is A1, Ca is A2. If Da is A2, Ca is A1. Similarly, let Cp represent
        the other port, so that if Dp is P1, Cp is P2. If Dp is P2, Cp is P1.
        If the "change port" flag was set in CHANGE-REQUEST attribute of the
        Binding Request, and the "change IP" flag was not set, the source IP
        address of the Binding Response MUST be Da and the source port of the
        Binding Response MUST be Cp. If the "change IP" flag was set in the
        Binding Request, and the "change port" flag was not set, the source IP
        address of the Binding Response MUST be Ca and the source port of the

<p>The server MUST add a RESPONSE-ORIGIN attribute to the Binding
        Response, containing the source address and port used to send the
        Binding Response.
</p>
<p>If the server supports an alternate address and port the server
        MUST add an OTHER-ADDRESS attribute to the Binding Response. This
        contains the source IP address and port that would be used if the
        client had set the "change IP" and "change port" flags in the Binding
        Request. As summarized in <a class='info' href='#oatable'>Table&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Impact of Flags on Packet Source and OTHER-ADDRESS</span><span>)</span></a>, these are Ca
        and Cp, respectively, regardless of the value of the CHANGE-REQUEST
        flags.
</p>
<p>Next the server inspects the Request for a XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET
        attribute. If the XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET attribute is included, then it
        includes an XOR-REFLECTED-FROM attribute with the source address the
        Request was received from.
</p>
<p>If the Request contained a PADDING attribute, PADDING MUST be
        included in the Binding Response. The server SHOULD use a length of
        PADDING equal to the MTU on the outgoing interface, rounded up to an
        even multiple of four bytes. If the Request also contains the
        XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET attribute the server MUST return an error response
        of type 400.
</p>
<p>Following that, the server completes the remainder of the
        processing from <a class='info' href='#RFC5389'>STUN<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Mahy, R., Matthews, P., and D. Wing, &ldquo;Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN),&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5389]. If authentication
        is being required, the server MUST include a MESSAGE-INTEGRITY and
        associated attributes as appropriate. A FINGERPRINT attribute is only
        required if the STUN messages are being multiplexed with application
        traffic that requires use of a FINGERPRINT to distinguish STUN
        messages.
</p>
<p>An ALTERNATE-SERVER attribute MUST NOT be included with any other
        attribute defined in this specification.
</p>
<p>When the server sends the Response, it is sent from the source
        address as determined above and to the destination address determined

CHANGE-REQUEST</h3>

<p>The CHANGE-REQUEST attribute contains two flags to control the IP
        address and port the server uses to send the response. These flags are
        called the "change IP" and "change port" flags. The CHANGE-REQUEST
        attribute is allowed only in the Binding Request. The "change IP" and
        "change port" flags are useful for determining the current filtering
        behavior of a NAT. They instruct the server to send the Binding
        Responses from the alternate source IP address and/or alternate port.
        The CHANGE-REQUEST attribute is optional in the Binding Request.
</p>
<p>The attribute is 32 bits long, although only two bits (A and B) are
        used:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre> 0                   1                   2                   3

XOR-REFLECTED-FROM</h3>

<p>The XOR-REFLECTED-FROM attribute is present only in Binding

<p>The XOR-REFLECTED-FROM attribute is used in place of RFC3489's
        REFLECTED-FROM attribute. It provides the same information, but

XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET</h3>

<p>The XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET attribute contains an IP address and port.
        The XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET attribute can be present in the Binding

        used in tests such as <a class='info' href='#sec-binding-desc'>Section&nbsp;4.6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Binding Lifetime Discovery</span><span>)</span></a>. When

        XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET attribute is optional in the Binding Request.
        Server support for XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET is optional.
</p>
<p>XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET is used in place of RFC3489's RESPONSE-ADDRESS.
        It provides the same information, but because the NAT's public address

PADDING</h3>

<p>The PADDING attribute allows for the entire message to be padded to
        force the STUN message to be divided into IP fragments. PADDING
        consists entirely of a freeform string, the value of which does not
        matter. PADDING can be used in either Binding Requests or Binding
        Responses.
</p>
<p>PADDING MUST NOT be longer than the length that brings the total IP
        datagram size to 64K. It SHOULD be equal in length to the MTU of the
        outgoing interface, rounded up to an even multiple of four bytes.
        Because STUN messages with PADDING are intended to test the behavior
        of UDP fragments, they are an exception to the usual rule that STUN
        messages be less than the MTU of the path.

CACHE-TIMEOUT</h3>

<p>The CACHE-TIMEOUT is used in Binding Requests and Responses. It
        indicates the time duration (in seconds) that the server will cache
        the source address and USERNAME of an original Binding Request that
        will later by followed by a request from a different source address
        with a XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET asking that a response be reflected to the
        source address of the original Binding Request. A server MUST NOT send
        a response to a target address requested with XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET
        unless it has cached that the same a previous binding was received
        from that target address. The client inserts a value in CACHE-TIMEOUT
        into the Binding Request indicating the amount of time it would like
        the server to cache that information. The server responds with a
        CACHE-TIMEOUT in its Binding Response providing a prediction of how
        long it will cache that information. The response value can be greater
        than, equal to, or less than the requested value. If the server is not
        able to provide such an estimate or the information in the response
        would be meaningless, the server SHOULD NOT include a CACHE-TIMEOUT
        attribute in its response. Server support for CACHE-TIMEOUT is
        optional.

<p>The STUN NAT Behavior Discovery usage allows a client to determine
        the current behavior of a NAT. This information can be quite useful to
        a developer or network administrator outside of an application, and as
        such can be used to diagnose the brittleness induced in another
        application. When used within an application itself, STUN NAT Behavior
        Discovery allows the application to adjust its behavior according to
        the current behavior of the NAT. This draft is experimental because
        the extent to which brittleness is introduced to an application
        relying on the Behavior Discovery usage is unclear and must be
        carefully evaluated by the designers of the protocol making use of it.
        The experimental test for this protocol is essentially determining
        whether an application can be made less brittle through the use of
        behavior-discovery information than it would be if attempted to make
        use of the network without any awareness of the NATs its traffic must
        pass through.

<p>A number of NAT boxes are now being deployed into the market which
        try and provide "generic" ALG functionality. These generic ALGs hunt
        for IP addresses, either in text or binary form within a packet, and
        rewrite them if they match a binding. This usage avoids that problem
        by using the XOR-REFLECTED-FROM and XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET attributes
        instead of the older REFLECTED-FROM and RESPONSE-ADDRESS
        attributes.
</p>
<p>This usage provides a set of generic attributes that can be
        assembled to test many types of NAT behavior. While tests for the most
        commonly known NAT box behaviors are described, the BEHAVE mailing
        list regularly has descriptions of new behaviors, some of which may
        not be readily detected using the tests described herein. However, the
        techniques described in this usage can be assembled in different
        combinations to test NAT behaviors not now known or envisioned.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>This usage inherits the security considerations of <a class='info' href='#RFC5389'>STUN<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Mahy, R., Matthews, P., and D. Wing, &ldquo;Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN),&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5389]. This usage adds several new attributes;
      security considerations for those are detailed here.
</p>
<p>OTHER-ADDRESS does not permit any new attacks; it provides another
      place where an attacker can impersonate a STUN server but it is not an
      interesting attack. An attacker positioned where it can compromise the
      Binding Response can completely hide the STUN server from the
      client.
</p>
<p>XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET allows a STUN server to be used as a reflector
      for denial-of-service attacks. It does not provide any amplification of
      the attack. The XOR-REFLECTED-FROM mitigates this by providing the
      identity (in terms of IP address) of the source where the request came
      from. Its purpose is to provide traceability, so that a STUN server
      cannot be used as an anonymous reflector for denial-of-service attacks.
      To mitigate the security threats of XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The server MUST NOT respond to requests with XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET
          unless they have cached state that a binding request with
          CACHE-TIMEOUT has previously been received from the target
          address.
</li>
<li>The server MUST either authenticate all requests using
          XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET or rate-limit its responses to such requests.
          Rate-limiting is RECOMMENDED even if authenticating requests, unless
          the server is deployed for an application requiring more frequent
          responses.
</li>
<li>Requests containing both XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET and PADDING are
          rejected by the server.
</li>
<li>Implementing XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET is optional, allowing servers
          that cannot store the required state and/or deployed for
          applications that don't require its use to automatically reject any
          requests containing it.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The only attack possible with the PADDING attribute is to have a
      large padding length which could cause a server to allocate a large
      amount of memory. As servers will ignore any padding length greater than
      64k so the scope of this attack is limited. In general, servers should
      not allocate more memory than the size of the received datagram. This
      attack would only affect non-compliant implementations.
</p>
<p>CHANGE-REQUEST provides no attacks, but adds three more reflection
      sources for the XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET reflection attacks. It provides no
      additional amplification, however, and the security mechanisms for
      XOR-RESPONSE-TARGET protect all addresses on the server.
</p>
<p>RESPONSE-ORIGIN, CACHE-TIMEOUT and XOR-REFLECTED-FROM do not provide
      any additional attacks.
