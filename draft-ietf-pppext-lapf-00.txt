Abstract

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method of
   encapsulating Network Layer protocol information over point-to-point
   links.

   This document defines a method for using PPP to transport multi-
   protocol datagrams over Frame Relay circuits.

DRAFT                     PPP over Frame Relay                March 1993


1.  Introduction

   PPP has three main components:

      1. A method for encapsulating datagrams over serial links.

      2. A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing, configuring,
         and testing the data link connection.

      3. A family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing
         and configuring different network layer protocols.

   PPP was designed as a standard method of communicating over point-
   to-point links.  Initial deployment has been over short local lines,
   leased lines, and plain-old-telephone-service (POTS) using modems.
   As new packet services and higher speed lines are introduced, PPP is
   easily deployed in these environments as well.

           One protocol to carry them all.
           One protocol to mind them.
           One protocol to link them all,
           and in the network bind them.


   Frame Relay is a relative newcomer to the serial link community.  The
   protocol was designed as a virtual circuit network.  There has been
   some interest in bringing the advantages of the PPP multi-protocol
   datagram service to this venue.  When Frame Relay emulates a point-
   to-point circuit, PPP is well suited to use over Frame Relay.

2.  Encapsulation

   PPP provides an encapsulation protocol over both bit-oriented
   synchronous links and asynchronous links with 8 bits of data and no
   parity.  These links MUST be full-duplex, but MAY be either dedicated
   or circuit-switched.  This fits the Frame Relay model.

   PPP uses HDLC [2] as a basis for the default encapsulation.  Frame
   Relay is also in the family of HDLC derivatives, and the Frame Relay
   header may be easily substituted for the smaller HDLC header.

   Unfortunately, the Frame Relay header is 3 octets in length.
   Therefore, a single octet of zero padding is used to align the header
   to a more convenient boundary.  The use of this zero padding is
   conformant with both the ISO Network Layer Protocol Identifier
   (NLPID) Null Network layer, and the PPP protocol field extension
   mechanism.

   LCP negotiation MUST permit the Pad and Protocol fields to be
   compressed to a single octet.  This will bring the header to the same
   size as the standard PPP HDLC header.


3.  In-Band Protocol Detection

   When Out-of-Band signaling is not used to configure call setup for
   the circuit, or the Null encapsulation is indicated, the PPP Protocol
   field may be easily distinguished from other NLPID values.  Initial
   LCP packets will contain the sequence 00-c0-21 following the header.

   Older implementations [3] might contain the NLPID value CC hex.
   Other ISO conformant implementations might contain other NLPID
   values, such as 80 hex (SNAP), or 81 hex (CLNP).  Such packets
   indicate that the link is not properly configured for PPP operation,
   and MUST generate a Protocol-Reject.


4.  Out-of-Band signaling

   There is no generally available method of out-of-band signalling.


5.  Configuration Details

   The standard LCP configuration defaults apply to Frame Relay links.

   The following Configurations Options are recommended:

      Address and Control Field Compression
      Protocol Field Compression


   Some early Frame Relay networks are only capable of 262 octet frames.
   In order to operate PPP over a Frame Relay link, the minimum PPP MRU
   of 1500 MUST be supported.

   To detect these inoperable links, the LCP Configure-Request packet
   MUST be padded to the full 1500 octet length.  The padding MUST be a
   sequence of octets beginning with 1, and ending with the number of
   octets of padding.

   XID negotiation is not supported for PPP links.

   There is no need for Inverse ARP over PPP links.
