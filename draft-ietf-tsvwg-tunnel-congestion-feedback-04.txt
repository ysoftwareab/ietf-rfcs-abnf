             draft-ietf-tsvwg-tunnel-congestion-feedback-04


Abstract

   This document describes a method to measure congestion on a tunnel
   segment based on recommendations from RFC 6040, "Tunneling of
   Explicit Congestion Notification", and to use IPFIX to communicate
   the congestion measurements from the tunnel's egress to a controller
   which can respond by modifying the traffic control policies at the
   tunnel's ingress.

INTERNET DRAFT         Tunnel Congestion Feedback       January 25, 2017


1. Introduction

   In IP networks, persistent congestion[RFC2914] lowers transport
   throughput, leading to waste of network resource. Appropriate
   congestion control mechanisms are therefore critical to prevent the
   network from falling into the persistent congestion state. Currently,
   transport protocols such as TCP[RFC793], SCTP[RFC4960],
   DCCP[RFC4340], have their built-in congestion control mechanisms, and
   even for certain single transport protocol like TCP there can be a
   couple of different congestion control mechanisms to choose from. All
   these congestion control mechanisms are implemented on host side, and
   there are reasons that only host side congestion control is not
   sufficient for the whole network to keep away from persistent
   congestion. For example, (1) some protocol's congestion control
   scheme may have internal design flaws; (2) improper software
   implementation of protocol; (3) some transport protocols, e.g.
   RTP[RFC3550] do not even provide congestion control at all.

   Tunnels are widely deployed in various networks including public
   Internet, data center network, and enterprise network etc. A tunnel
   consists of ingress, egress and a set of intermediate routers. For
   the tunnel scenario, a tunnel-based mechanism is introduced for
   network traffic control to keep the network from persistent
   congestion. Here, tunnel ingress will implement  congestion
   management function to control the traffic entering the tunnel.

   This document provides a mechanism of feeding back inner tunnel
   congestion level to the ingress. Using this mechanism the egress can
   feed the tunnel congestion level information it collects back to the
   ingress. After receiving this information the ingress will be able to
   perform congestion management according to network management policy.

   The feedback model mainly consists of tunnel egress and tunnel
   ingress. The tunnel egress composes of meter function and exporter
   function; tunnel ingress composes AP (Action Point) function,
   collector function and DP (Decision Point) function.

   The Meter function collects network congestion level information, and
   conveys the information to Exporter which feeds back the information
   to the collector function.

   The collector collects congestion level information from exporter,
   after that congestion management Decision Point (DP) function will
   make congestion management decision based on the information from
   collector.

   The action point controls the traffic entering tunnel, and it
   implements traffic control decision of DP.

4. Congestion Level Measurement

      This section describes how to measure congestion level in a
      tunnel.

      The congestion level measurement is based on ECN (Explicit
      Congestion Notification) [RFC3168] and packet drop. If the routers
      support ECN, after router's queue length is over a predefined
      threshold, the routers will mark the ECN-capable packets as
      Congestion Experienced (CE) or drop not-ECT packets with the
 


Wei                      Expires July 29, 2017                  [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT         Tunnel Congestion Feedback       January 25, 2017


      probability proportional to queue length; if the queue overflows
      all packets will be dropped. If the routers do not support ECN,
      after router's queue length is over a predefined threshold, the
      routers will drop both the ECN-capable packets and the not-ECT
      packets with the probability proportional to the queue length. 

      The network congestion level could be indicated through the ratio
      of CE-marked packet and the ratio of packet drop, the relationship
      between these two kinds of indicator is complementary. If the
      congestion level in tunnel is not high enough, the packets would
      be marked as CE instead of being dropped, and then it is easy to
      calculate congestion level according to the ratio of CE-marked
      packets. If the congestion level is so high that ECT packet will
      be dropped, then the packet loss ratio could be calculated by
      comparing total packets entering ingress and total packets
      arriving at egress over the same span of packets, if packet loss
      is detected, it could be assumed that severe congestion has
      occurred in the tunnel. Because loss is only ever a sign of
      serious congestion, so it doesn't need to measure loss ratio
      accurately.

      Faked ECN-capable transport (ECT) is used at ingress to defer
      packet loss to egress. The basic idea of faked ECT is that, when
      encapsulating packets, ingress first marks tunnel outer header
      according to RFC6040, and then remarks outer header of Not-ECT
      packet as ECT, there will be three kinds of combination of outer
      header ECN field and inner header ECN field: CE|CE, ECT|N-ECT,
      ECT|ECT (in the form of outer ECN| inner ECN); when decapsulating
      packets at egress, RFC6040 defined decapsulation behavior is used,
      and according to RFC6040, the packets marked as CE|N-ECT will be
      dropped by egress. 

      To calculate congestion level, for the same span of packets, the
      number of each kind of ECN marking packet at ingress and egress
      will be compared to get the volume of CE-marked packet in the
      tunnel; and the total number of packets at ingress and egress will
      be compared to detect the packet loss.

      The basic procedure of congestion level measurement is as follows:

          Figure 2: Procedure of Congestion Level Measurement

   Ingress encapsulates packets and marks outer header according to
   faked ECT as described above. Ingress cumulatively counts packets for
   three types of ECN combination (CE|CE, ECT|N-ECT, ECT|ECT) and then
   the ingress regularly sends cumulative packet counts message of each
   type of ECN combination to the egress. When each message arrives, the
   egress cumulatively counts packets coming from the ingress and adds  
   its own packet counts of each type of ECN combination (CE|CE, ECT|N-
   ECT, CE|N-ECT, CE|ECT, ECT|ECT) to the message and returns the whole
   message to the ingress.

   The counting of packets can be at the granularity of the all traffic
   from the ingress to the egress to learn about the overall congestion
   status of the path between the ingress and the egress. The counting
   can also be at the granularity of individual customer's traffic or a
   specific set of flows to learn about their congestion contribution.

5. Congestion Information Delivery

   As described above, the tunnel ingress needs to convey a message
   containing cumulative packet counts of each type of ECN combination
   to tunnel egress, and the tunnel egress also needs to feed back the
   message of cumulative packet counts of each type of ECN combination
   to the ingress. This section describes how the messages should be
   conveyed.

   The message travels along the same path with network data traffic,
   referred as in-band signal. Because the message is transmitted in
   band, so the message packet may get lost in case of network
   congestion. To cope with the situation that the message packet gets
   lost, the packet counts values are sent as cumulative counters. Then
 


Wei                      Expires July 29, 2017                  [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT         Tunnel Congestion Feedback       January 25, 2017


   if a message is lost the next message will recover the missing
   information. Even though the missing information could be recovered,
   the message should be transmitted in a much higher priority than
   users' traffic flows.

   IPFIX [RFC7011] is selected as information feedback protocol. IPFIX
   uses preferably SCTP as transport. SCTP allows partially reliable
   delivery [RFC3758], which ensures the feedback message will not be
   blocked in case of packet loss due to network congestion. 

   Ingress can do congestion management at different granularity which
   means both the overall aggregated inner tunnel congestion level and
   congestion level contributed by certain traffic(s) could be measured
   for different congestion management purpose. For example, if the
   ingress only wants to limit congestion volume caused by certain
   traffic(s),e.g UDP-based traffic, then congestion volume for the
   traffic will be fed back; or if the ingress do overall congestion
   management, the aggregated congestion volume will be fed back.

   When sending message from ingress to egress, the ingress acts as
   IPFIX exporter and egress acts as IPFIX collector; When feedback
   congestion level information from egress to ingress, then the egress
   acts as IPFIX exporter and ingress acts as IPFIX collector.

   The combination of congestion level measurement and congestion
   information delivery procedure should be as following:

   # The ingress determines IPFIX template record to be used. The
   template record can be preconfigured or determined at runtime, the
   content of template record will be determined according to the
   granularity of congestion management, if the ingress wants to limit
   congestion volume contributed by specific traffic flow then the
   elements such as source IP address, destination IP address, flow id
   and CE-marked packet volume of the flow etc will be included in the
   template record.

   # Meter on ingress measures traffic volume according to template
   record chosen and then the measurement records are sent to egress in
   band.

   # Meter on egress measures congestion level information according to
   template record, the content of template record should  be the same
   as template record of ingress.

   # Exporter of egress sends measurement record together with the
   measurement record of ingress back to the ingress.

6. Congestion Management

   After tunnel ingress receives congestion level information, then
   congestion management actions could be taken based on the
   information, e.g. if the congestion level is higher than a predefined
   threshold, then action could be taken to reduce the congestion level.

   The design of network side congestion management SHOULD take host
   side e2e congestion control mechanism into consideration, which means
   the congestion management needs to avoid the impacts on e2e
   congestion control. For instance, congestion management action must
   be delayed by more than a worst-case global RTT (e.g. 100ms),
   otherwise tunnel traffic management will not give normal e2e
   congestion control enough time to do its job, and the system could go

   unstable.

   The detailed description of congestion management is out of scope of
   this document, as examples, congestion management such as circuit
   breaker [CB] could be applied. Circuit breaker is an automatic
   mechanism to estimate congestion, and to terminate flow(s) when
   persistent congestion is detected to prevent network congestion
   collapse.

6.1 Example

   This subsection provides an example of how the solution described in
   this document could work.

   First of all, IPFIX template records are exchanged between ingress
   and egress to negotiate the format of data record, the example here
   is to measure the congestion level for the overall tunnel (caused by
   all the traffic in tunnel). After the negotiation is finished,
   ingress sends in-band message to egress, the message contains the
   number of each kind of ECN-marked packets (i.e. CE|CE, ECT|N-ECT and
   ECT|ECT) received until the sending of message.

   After egress receives the message, the egress counts number of
   different kinds of ECN-marking packets received until receiving the
   message, then the egress sends a feedback message containing the
   counts together with the information in ingress's message to ingress.

   Figure 3 to Figure 6 below show the example procedure between ingress
   and egress.

INTERNET DRAFT         Tunnel Congestion Feedback       January 25, 2017


   The following provides an example of how tunnel congestion level
   could be calculated:

   Congestion Level could be divided into two categories:(1)slight
   congestion(no packets dropped); (2)serious congestion (packet
   dropping happen).

   For slight congestion, the congestion level is indicated as the
   number  of CE-marked packet:

   ce_marked = (A2 + D + E) - A1;

   For serious congestion, the congestion level is indicated as the
   number of lost packets:

   total_ingress = (A1 + B1 + C1)

   total_egress = (A2 + B2 + C2 + D + E)

   packet_loss = (total_ingress - total_egress)

7. Security Considerations

   This document describes the tunnel congestion calculation and
   feedback.

   The tunnel endpoints are assumed to be deployed in the same
   administrative domain, so the ingress and egress will trust each
   other, the signaling traffic between ingress and egress will be
   protected utilizing security mechanism provided IPFIX (see section 11
   in RFC7011).

   From the consideration of privacy point of view, in case of fine
   grained congestion management, ingress is aware of the amount of
   traffic for specific application flows inside the tunnel which seems
   to be an invasion of privacy. But in any way, the ingress could The
   solution doesn't introduce more privacy problem.


8. IANA Considerations

   This document defines a set of new IPFIX Information Elements
   (IE),which need to be registered at IANA IPFIX Information Element
   Registry.
