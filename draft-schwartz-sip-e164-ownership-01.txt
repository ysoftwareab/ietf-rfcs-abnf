Abstract

   When a call travels end-to-end relayed from the PSTN to SIP then
   problems occur with E.164 number ownership.  Additionally, there are
   security challenges when the PSTN-VoIP gateway has to authenticate

   and authorize the calling party.  Without addressing these two
   aspects the overall security story is weak or non-existent.  This
   document aims to investigate these two aspect; it does, however, not
   investigate current E.164 number handling with RFC 4474 ("SIP
   Identity").  Such an analysis is provided by other documents already.

Internet-Draft      E.164 Ownership Problem Statement      February 2008


1.  Introduction

   RFC 4474 [2] defines a mechanism whereby an authentication service
   asserts the identity of a SIP UAC and determines whether he or she is
   authorized to use that identity.  The authentication service then
   computes a hash over some particular headers, including the From
   header field and the bodies in the message.  This hash is signed with
   the certificate for the domain and inserted in the 'Identity' header
   field in the SIP message.  The proxy also inserts a companion header
   field, Identity-Info, that tells the verifying party how to acquire
   its certificate, in case it is not yet known already.

   When the verifier receives the SIP message, it verifies the signature
   provided in the Identity header, and thus can determine whether the
   domain indicated by the host portion of the AoR in the From header
   field authenticated the user, and permitted the user to assert that
   From header field value.

   The use of phone numbers with SIP was introduced with the TEL URL
   scheme [4] whereby domain names were not used with the phone numbers.
   SIP URIs always have domain names.  In SIP [1], a translation between
   SIP URIs and TEL URLs is described: when translating from a SIP URI
   to a TEL URL, the domain name from the SIP URI is simply dropped.
   When translating in the other direction (or simply generating a SIP
   URI from an E.164 number [13]) it is not clear how to populate the
   domain name.

   When SIP Identity [2] is applied to E.164 numbers then there is the
   question what the identity assertion actually means.  Additionally,
   the usage of the domain for an E.164 number causes problems, as
   described in [6].  This document will, however, not focus on this
   aspect.  Instead, we investigate the overall end-to-end security
   story and the ownership problem for E.164 numbers.


2.  Terminology

   This document largely relies on the terminology introduced by [2].


3.  The End-to-End Picture

   In the context of "ownership" it is hard to speak of the end-to-end
   picture without first identifying four possible use-cases for this
   e2e communication.  The first two start AND end on IP and the second
   two start OR end on IP.  Please refer to Figure 1 below for the first
   two cases.

             Figure 1: Federation based IP-to-IP Communication

3.1.  IP-IP Case

   The first use case is that of a call that originates and terminates
   on the IP network without ever touching the PSTN but that uses E.164
   addressing instead of the preferred URI.  This case is quite
   prevalent today in some of the private peering federations.  These
   federations are seen as a first choice (if I can terminate to an IP
   great - otherwise let me know and I will failover or route advance to
   the PSTN) for outbound routing of E.164 numbers.  Since these
   federations are being used in conjunction with the PSTN it is quite
   logical that the addressing will be E.164 and not SIP URI based.

   As can be seen in Figure 1 if Alice calls Bob the call will be IP
   based end-to-end while if she calls Carl it will exit to the PSTN.
   Ownership, therefore needs to be considered in the context of this
   use-case.  Does the COR play any role in this case?  Can these
   numbers be treated as private plan numbers placing all onus solely on
   the respective VSPs servicing Alice and Bob?

Internet-Draft      E.164 Ownership Problem Statement      February 2008


3.2.  IP-PSTN-IP Case

   In this case Dan's VSP is not a member of the federation that is
   shared by Alice and Bob and as such so far as Alice is concerned Dan
   is not accessible via IP.

   What considerations should be discussed in this case?  In reality
   both origination and termination are IP, however, the transit is PSTN
   and who know what happens in that world.  What is the notion of
   ownership here?  Since any "domain" information will be stripped by
   the PSTN is there any advantage whatsoever to including it?

3.3.  PSTN-to-IP Case

   Consider Figure 2 where Carl is using a PSTN phone and initiates
   calls to Alice.  Alice is using an IP-based phone.  The call of Carl
   traverses the PSTN and enters the Internet via some PSTN/VoIP
   gateway.  This gateway applies SIP Identity to the call.  What does
   the signed identity mean?  Can the gateway in typical deployment
   cases verify the caller id in any meaningful way?  Later, when
   Alice's SIP UA receives the call it may run some authorization
   procedure against the received identity.  It may "outsource" the
   decision to the user by just displaying anything received.  Unless
   the calling domain itself operates the gateway it is less likely that
   the domain part that may have been added to the E.164 number contains
   information that can be associated meaningfully with the calling
   party.  For example, a bank might use the PSTN within their branches
   and operate their own gateway to the IP-based network and hence the
   domain part of the identity could in fact indicate, for example,
   mybank-example.com.  If this gate is operated by an entirely
   different entity then the domain might show something like
   gateway.operator-example.com.  Without a binding between the E.164
   number and the domain of the authentication service attacks are
   possible.

3.4.  IP-to-PSTN Case

   Consider Figure 3 where Alice calls Carl.  Carl uses a PSTN phone and
   Alice an IP-based phone.  When Alice initiates the call the E.164
   number needs to get translated, for example using ENUM, to a SIP URI
   and subsequently to an IP address.  The call of Alice traverses her
   VoIP provider where the SIP Identity signature is added.  It then
   hits the PSTN/VoIP gateway.  What would the gateway do with the SIP
   Identity header?  Can he do anything meaningful with it?  Ideally,
   Alice would like to know whether she, for example, talks to someone
   at her bank rather than to someone intercepting the call.  Would
   Connected Identity help her?  What would the quality of the
   subsequently established media security between the gateway and
   Alice's SIP UA be?

4.  Authenticating and Authorizing the Calling Party Identity

   RFC 4474 rightfully makes some important assumptions about the
   behavior of the authentication service that contribute significantly
   to the security of the overall system.  While some assumptions seem
   to be obvious for SIP usage, they are less obvious when considering
   them in relationship with a PSTN interworking or E.164 number usage.
   Section 4 of [2] says:

      "The authentication service authenticates Alice (possibly by
      sending a Digest authentication challenge) and validates that she
      is authorized to assert the identity that is populated in the From
      header field.  This value may be Alice's AoR, or it may be some
      other value that the policy of the proxy server permits her to
      use.

      ...

      The proxy, as the holder of the private key of its domain, is
      asserting that the originator of this request has been
      authenticated and that she is authorized to claim the identity
      (the SIP address- of-record) that appears in the From header
      field.  "

Internet-Draft      E.164 Ownership Problem Statement      February 2008


   The crutial question therefore is: In the generic case is the
   authentication service able to authenticate the caller-ID used in the
   PSTN and to authorize it's usage?

   There are problems with this step:

   1.  The PSTN builds on a walled garden with a chain-of-trust security
       model.  This is "nice" as long as the participating parties are
       indeed honest.  Unfortunately, this is not true anymore (and has
       not been the case for a long time already) [add-references].
       Caller-ID spoofing is common and even transit providers are not
       trustworthy either.
   2.  A call originated on the PSTN is often times routed to a PSTN/
       VoIP gateway.  That PSTN gateway is operated by the owner of the
       called number, rather than the owner of the calling number.


5.  Verifying Ownership: What does it mean?

   Imagine a verification service at Alice's VoIP provider network
   receives a SIP message with an 'Identity' and an 'Identity-Info'
   header.

   When the username and the domain name are tightly bound together then
   there is no question whether a particular authentication service
   operating at a specific domain is administratively reponsible for a
   specific username part.  However, if this binding is relaxed or even
   removed then there is a question of which authentication service is
   allowed to warrant for which usernames.

   Ownership is an artificial construct but one could compare it with an
   oracle that returns the name of a domain when asked who is
   authoritative for using a particular E.164 number.

   The problem is compounded by the fact that there may be more than one
   legitimate owner.  Consider if you will the case where an enterprise
   (PBX) uses a Voice Service Provider (VSP) for IP communication
   services and the VSP acquires E.164 numbers from an exchange who in
   turn acquires the numbers from the Carrier of Record (COR).  This is
   illustrated in Figure 4.

   If one was to compare this to the path validation approach used in
   chain-of-trust certificate validation schemes, the COR would be the
   trust anchor and would sign the exchange cert who in turn would sign
   the VSP cert who in turn would sign the PBX cert which would be used
   in 4474 [2].  While the steps needed to traverse up the chain and
   check all the certs are seemingly quite expensive (performance wise
   for calls at least) one must realize that calling patterns are quite
   determanistic and as such caching is believed to alleviate this issue
   and make it tolerable.  Without this chain-of-trust approach it is
   hard to give credibility to any "ownership" assertion.

   Looking at "ownership" in this way may necessitate an Authority
   Information Access (AIA) [11] equivalent so that a URI scoping an
   E.164 number would provide the pointer back up the tree for complete
   validation.  If the number is ported from one COR to another all that
   would be needed is to modify the AIA information starting with the
   anchor and down to where relevant.

   There are various owership verification steps that got used in the
   IETF within other protocols.  RFC 4474 [2], for example, uses the
   following verification step for SIP URIs:

      "6.  Verifier Behavior

      Step 2:


      The verifier MUST follow the process described in Section 13.4 to
      determine if the signer is authoritative for the URI in the From
      header field.

      13.4.  Domain Names and Subordination


      When a verifier processes a request containing an Identity-Info
      header, it must compare the domain portion of the URI in the From
      header field of the request with the domain name that is the
      subject of the certificate acquired from the Identity-Info
      header."

   This is a concept of referential integrity where information of the
   protocol (in this case the identity) is matched against information
   from the certificate.  The signer and the verifier need to have a
   trust anchor in common.  There are additional aspects about the
   detailed matching procedure that are described in Section 13.4 of
   [2].

   Unfortunately, this simple authorization check cannot be used with
   E.164 numbers because of the missing domain concept in the identifier
   itself and because of number portability.  Imagine if the SIP
   Identity authentication service would have to sign calling parties
   SIP URIs that do not belong to the domain the authentication service
   is responsible for.  The corresponding verification check would be
   far more complicated -- the authentication service would have to show
   that it is indeed entitled to act on behalf of someone else.

   A couple of other ownership approaches have been used in IETF
   protocols.  These examples are not meant to claim that the problem is
   easy to solve (in the style of just pick one) or that there is even a
   satisfactory solution at all.  They are just listed to illustrate the
   different flavors and the quality of the warrants:

   Return Routability Check:  A form of check is to exploit the
      topological properties of identifier routing and the possible
      placements of adversaries with respect to a certain message
      interaction.  RRT and various other forms fall into that category.
      An example can be found in [8].

   Authorization Certificates:

      A form of check is to use authorization certificates.  The basic
      idea is that one would trust the entity that creates the
      authorization certificate (most likely in a hierarchical form)
      then you also trust its content.  SIP-SAML (see [7]) and [12]
      belong to this category.  When the identity of the certificate is
      constructed in a suitable way then together with a delegated
      signing the same effect could be accomplished.

Internet-Draft      E.164 Ownership Problem Statement      February 2008


   Distributed Databases:

      Another form of mechanism is to use an out-of-band database
      lookup, for example using the DNS, in order to verify that the
      entity which uses the private key for creating the SIP Identity
      header is authorized to attach the corresponding public key to the
      this distributed database.  The identity would be used for the
      lookup to the database and the security of the system relies on
      ensuring that only those entities add the public key that are also
      owner of the corresponding E.164 number.  An example of such an
      approach can be found in [15].  The usage of TRIP [10] (with
      extensions with information about E.164 numbers that are
      authorized for usage by a specific provider) has been discussed as
      well.

   Cryptographic Addresses and Hash Chains:

      These mechanisms utilize a temporal property by creating a binding
      between the public key (or values from a hash chain) and the
      identity be verified by re-computing the hash value and by
      comparing the hash with the identifier.  These mechanisms have
      found some excitment with protocol work at lower layers (see, for
      example, [9]).

   Needless to say that each mechanism has different scalability,
   security and deployment properties.


6.  Security Considerations

   With the work on this subject it is important to keep two quotes in
   mind:

   o  "The security of a system is as good as the weakest link."
   o  "If you think cryptography is the solution to your problem, you
      don't know what your problem is." --- Roger Needham

   The authors argue that the problem scope and the envisioned technical
   properties are not yet understood enough.  Furthermore, it is
   necessary to investigate deployment challenges imposed by the
   existing infrastructure and deployment incentives for various
   approaches.
