                Address Pool Management Yang Data Model
            draft-sun-i2apm-address-pool-management-yang-01

Abstract

   This document describes a YANG data model for address pool
   management.  It can be used to automatically allocate, update and
   delete address pools in different devices of an underlying network.

1.  Introduction

   Address Pool Management is one of the basic elements to configure in
   a network to offer connectivity services to connected devices.
   Concretely, pools can be provisioned to DHCP servers, IPv4 service
   continuity devices (e.g., DS-Lite AFTR, NAT64), Carrier Grade NAT
   (CGN), Broadband Network Gateway (BNG), etc.  Automated means to
   rationalize the management of address resources and to make sure the
   underlying routing and forwarding capabilities are appropriately
   configured.  This document specifies a YANG data model for that
   purpose.

   A device can be provisioned with a pool of addresses for various
   reasons: service requesting hosts with addresses or prefixes (e.g.,
   DHCP server, Delegating router), inject appropriate routing entries
   (e.g., PE, BNG) given that prefix assignments and routing actions
   must be correlated otherwise delivery of connectivity service will
   fail.  This document does not elaborate the usage of pools
   provisioned to a network element.

   It is worth mentioning that: (1) Current practices rely on static
   configuration.  This practice is prone to errors. (2) The level of
   route aggregation cannot be driven by PE routers without any hint(s)
   from an entity that has the visibility on aggregation policies and
   the status of prefixes, etc. (3) Relying on proprietary means to
   trigger the injection of routing entries may lead to undesired
   behavior: increase the size of routing table and forwarding table due
   to injecting very specific routes, etc.

Internet-Draft   Yang Model for Address Pool Management    December 2015


   Within this document, an address pool usually contains the address
   pool type, start- address, end-address, its corresponding lifetime
   and the identification of the usage.  Each address pool is
   represented by an Address Pool Entry (APE).

   Pools may be specific to a service offered by a network or be valid
   for all services.

   Pools can be added and/or withdrawn.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document:

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is defined in
   [RFC6020].

   The meaning of the symbols in the tree diagrams is as follows:

      Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

      Curly braces "{" and "}" contain names of optional features that
      make the corresponding node conditional.

      Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write), "ro" state data (read-only).

      Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!" a
      container with presence, and "*" denotes a "list" or "leaf-list".

      Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

      Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

3.  AddressPoolManagement Data Model

   There are two YANG modules in the model.  The first module, "ietf-
   address-pool", defines generic address pool aspects which is common
   to all use cases.  The second module, "ietf-address-pool-status",
   defines the status of the address pool.

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the support of SSH is mandatory to
   implement secure transport [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control
   model [RFC6536] provides means to restrict access for particular
   NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF
   protocol operations and contents.

   All data nodes defined in the YANG module which can be created,
   modified and deleted (i.e., config true, which is the default).
   These data nodes are considered sensitive.  Write operations (e.g.,
   edit-config) applied to these data nodes without proper protection
   can negatively affect network operations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the following URI in the
   "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

               URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-address-pool
               Registrant Contact: The IESG.
               XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

                            Figure 3: namespace

   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG module in
   the "YANG Module Names" registry [RFC6020].

               name: ietf-address-pool
               namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-address-pool
               prefix: address-pool
               reference: RFC XXXX
