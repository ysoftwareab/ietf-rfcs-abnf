     Abstract 
         
        This document describes a new method, which will automatically 
        acquire the host name of active IPv6 nodes and register it to the 
        local Domain Name System (DNS) server. Active IPv6 nodes are nodes 
        that are connected to a network. 
         
        Our proposed new protocol, which is called Host Name Resolution 
        Protocol (HNRP) [6], will automatically learn some useful 
        information from all the IPv6 nodes, such as the host name and the 
        IP address. All the information will be kept by HRRP and the host 
        name together with the IPv6 address will be added to the DNS. This 
        will be implemented without the need for any changes at the clients' 
        site.  
         
        The objective of this document is to specify the new Host Name 
        Resolution Protocol and also the algorithm used in the protocol.

     1. Introduction 
         
        Domain Name System has long been used for resolving host name to IP 
        address and vice versa.  The need of automatically sensing the host 
        name and IP addresses on a network by DNS does not arise because 
        IPv4 addresses are easy to remember. The improvement of DNS with the 
        introduction of DNSv6 should have included this new feature so that 
        it would be an intelligent application. 
         
        The reason for the proposed protocol and the solutions are as 
        follows. 
         
        1.  The main factor that drives us to introduce this protocol is the 
            IPv6 addressing scheme. 128 bits IPv6 address is indeed very 
            long to remember compared to IPv4. This hexadecimal 
            representation makes unit of network difficult to be identified 
            and remembered based on this IP address. Instead of remembering 
            one's IP address, it will be easier for us to just use the host 
            name.

     Internet Draft           HNRP For IPv6 nodes                August, 2001 
      
      
            To solve this problem, the Host Name Resolution protocol will 
            automatically sense all the IPv6 nodes on a specific link and 
            add all the names of the nodes within that domain to its DNS. 
            This will also give the users the freedom to choose their own 
            host name for their node/s. An algorithm in the protocol will 
            check the uniqueness of the host name of each node. 
         
        2.  Maintenance of these addresses is another hassle for system 
            administrator. In current DNS, system administrators manually 
            enter the host name and the IP address associated with it into 
            the host name file. Whenever there is a change to a node in the 
            domain, system administrator must manually edit the host name 
            file to make sure that the new node's information is updated to 
            the list.  
         
            To solve the above-mentioned problem, HNRP will periodically 
            check and update the nodes' information into the host name file, 
            if there are changes to the nodes. Even though we can use 
            dynamic update [8] to send updated information to the DNS, this 
            is restricted to certain operating system that implemented the 
            dynamic update.   
         
        By using this protocol, cost of handling and maintaining the host 
        names can be reduced in huge amount. The amount of time spend by 
        system administrator on setting up the host names will also be 
        reduced.  
         
        This document proposes a new protocol to dynamically handle the host 
        names on an IPv6 LAN, which is named Host Name Resolution Protocol. 
        This document also describes the algorithm used in Host Name 
        Resolution Protocol.  
         
        The implementation of this protocol involves few existing methods. 
        For example, to get the nodes information, the use the Neighbor 
        solicitation (Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) packet) and also the 
        ICMPv6 packet will be implemented. This protocol supports all types 
        of IPv6 addresses available, which are link local addresses, site 
        local addresses and global unicast addresses. 
      
      
      
     2. Study on existing and similar application [6] 
         
        The dynamic naming of host name was not implemented in IPv4 because 
        IPv4 are easy to remember compared to IPv6 addresses. The only 
        proposed method was discussed in a draft titled Domain Name Auto-
        Registration for plugged in IPv6 [3].

     2.1 Domain Name Auto-Registration for plugged in IPv6 
         <draft-kitamura-ipv6-name-auto-reg-00.txt> 
         
        This draft has proposed to use a method for domain name auto-
        registration for plugged in IPv6 nodes. The method is divided into 2 
        functions, which are _detector_ function and _registrar_ function. 
        The _detector_ is used to detect the appearance of new IPv6 nodes 
        and send it to a _Registrar_. The _Registrar_ is used to prepare 
        appropriate domain name information for registration and to register 
        it by sending dynamic update messages to the corresponding request.  
         
        Two approaches are used in the draft to detect the nodes. One of the 
        methods is by detecting the DAD packets. The other approach is by 
        using the SNMP procedure. 
          
        Our proposed protocol is similar to the above draft except that our 
        protocol uses the DAD together with the ICMPv6 packet to get the 
        host name. 
      
      
     3. Design of Host Name Resolution Protocol 
         
        This section describes the design of the new protocol, Host Name 
        Resolution Protocol (HNRP) [9]. The algorithm used in this protocol 
        to solve the above mentioned problems would also be discussed in 
        this section.  
      
      
     3.1 Design Issue 
         
        The Host Name Resolution Protocol can be incorporated into DNS. 
        There are few issues involved in designing this protocol.  
         
        1.  Assignment of multiple IPv6 addresses to a single interface 
            makes names assignment a complex problem. Each IPv6 active nodes 
            is capable of having multiple IP addresses. The IPv6 nodes will 
            have a default link local address, which is configured 
            automatically using the autoconfiguration method [1]. Each node 
            would also be able to construct it's own global address using 
            the prefix advertised by a router on the same link. Beside that 
            we can also manually assign a global IPv6 address to that same 
            interface.  So, we must make sure that all the addresses point 
            to the same host name, unless the system administrator wants to 
            configure the IP addresses with different host names. To solve 
            this problem, default address selection can be used [10]. 
         
        2.  To minimize the changes on nodes, HNRP's implementation required 
            the development at one site. This will make the HNRP to use the 
            existing methods to implement and it would also support all 
            operating systems.

        3.  The location of the HNRP on the network needs to be decided. If 
            a DNS is shared between 2 LANs, HNRP must be implemented so that 
            it can detect all the nodes in both the LANs. This is because 
            DAD and ICMPv6 packets used for detection of nodes won't go 
            through the router that separates the LANs. 
         
      
      
     3.2 Design Method 
         
        To make HNRP an efficient protocol and robust, we divided the 
        protocol into two entities, the agent and the resolver.

        Figure 1 shows the HNRP protocol and the communication between the 
        two entities. 
         
         
     3.2.1 The Agent 
         
        The Agent's function is to detect all the nodes on a link and keep 
        the information in a specific file. It uses two detection methods 
        for getting the information from the node by using the DAD packet 
        and the ICMPv6 packet. The detection of DAD packets is restricted on 
        a single LAN because the router won't allow the DAD packets to pass 
        through. So, the Agent must be places on all the LANs to detect the 
        DAD packets. The best place for the agent is the router.

        The Agent need to be manually configured first so that the 
        information that it detects can be send to the resolver to be 
        updated into the DNS. It also will do periodic check on the LAN to 
        make sure that new changes on nodes are updated to the DNS.  
      
      
     3.2.2 The Resolver 
         
        This entity receives the information from the agent and updates the 
        information to the DNS. It also has the naming algorithm to name the 
        nodes. The resolver must be configured so that it directly update 
        the nodes' information to the DNS. It  
          
        In order to make the resolver to work effectively, it must be placed 
        together with the DNS. This will make sure that the information is 
        updated as soon as the resolver received it from the agent. 
      
      
      
     3.3 Detection Method 
         
        This is the main method in HNRP protocol. In this method, the agent 
        will detect any new IPv6 nodes on a link, check the uniqueness of 
        that node on that link and then update the information in the DNS.  
         
        There are 2 kinds of detection method used in the protocol. This two 
        methods need to be combined to make sure that the nodes are 
        configured correctly with the host name in the DNS.  
         
        1.  Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) 
         
            The nodes can be detected by monitoring the duplicate address 
            detection (DAD) packet issued by nodes that has been activated. 
            The DAD packet is issued as part of neighbor solicitation in 
            neighbor discovery [2]. The implementation of duplicate address 
            detection is compulsory on all IPv6 nodes, regardless of whether 
            they are obtained through stateful, stateless or manual 
            configuration. DAD has the same functions as the ARP packet in 
            IPv4 but DAD provides more information. The DAD algorithm is 
            issued to ensure that all configured addresses are likely to be 
            unique on a given link [1].  
         
            Once an IPv6 node issues a DAD packet to a link, the agent will 
            capture it and the packet will be analyzed. Then using ICMPv6 
            packet, the agent will issue a query to that node for more 
            information (see section 2 of 3.4). All the information that has 
            been captured will be kept in a specific file for reference. It 
            should be noted that the DAD packets could only be detected on a

     Internet Draft           HNRP For IPv6 nodes                August, 2001 
      
      
            link-local, thus the agent must be positioned on a specific 
            location to detect the packets (see section 3.4). 
         
         
        2.  ICMPv6 _ node information query and node information reply  
         
            This is the most important part in the agent. ICMPv6 type that 
            will be in the agent are node information query and node 
            information reply. Matt Crawford already defined the use of NI 
            query as type 139 and NI reply type 140 [4]. Currently the 
            ICMPv6 packet type for querying nodes information is still in 
            the process of upgrading. Node information query and node 
            information reply are information-based messages. NI query 
            packet is sent by the _Querier_ node to ask some information 
            from the _Responder_ node. The _Responder_ node, upon receiving 
            the NI query packet, replies to the querier with the information 
            requested by the _Querier_ node.  
         
            This will be an exact method that will be used by the agent to 
            query IPv6 nodes on a link. The ICMPv6 packet can be addressed 
            to a unicast address, a link local multicast address or an 
            anycast address depending on the scope of the information 
            required. In this implementation we will skip the use of anycast 
            and only use the unicast and the multicast address.   
         
            The ICMP source address should be that of the address where the 
            agent reside. In this case it is the DNS or the router or any 
            nodes IP address where the agent reside. This is to make sure 
            that the reply is send back to HNRP. The destination address can 
            be chosen from the 2 types of addresses according to the 
            algorithm. There will be 2 scenarios for choosing the 
            destination address: 
         
            i)   If a node has been detected using the DAD packet, then the 
                destination address will be the unicast address of the 
                detected node. After getting the IPv6 address from the DAD 
                packet, HNRP will use it as a destination address in the NI 
                query requesting for host name (type 2 for qtype field).  
         
            ii)  The Agent uses the link local multicast address as the 
                destination address to do periodic checking on a link to 
                detect any changes or updates to a node. The predefined all 
                node link local multicast address is FF02::1. This packet 
                need to be sent from time to time so that the changes can be 
                detected earlier to make HNRP efficient. The frequency of 
                sending this type of packets will also need to be 
                considered. Even though the ICMPv6 packets send are small, 
                if it is send too frequent, it might flood the network.  For 
                it to work efficiently the internal time taken for sending 
                the ICMPv6 packet need to be acceptable.

            The content of qtype in the ICMPv6 packet that will be used by 
            the agent is either type 2 (DNS names) or 3 (Node Addresses) and 
            the implementation of the agent is done with an assumption that 
            all the nodes are configured with the latest ICMPv6. Upon 
            receiving a NI query, the nodes must check the query's IPv6 
            destination address and discard it if it is not intended for the 
            node. The destination address of the query should be either the 
            IP address of the receiving node or the multicast address that 
            the receiving node joined earlier. The use of these ICMPv6 type 
            is described is detail in the draft by Crawford [4].

     3.4 Updating the DNS by the Resolver 
         
        The resolver's function is to update the DNS with the information 
        received from the agent/s. It will receive the information from the 
        agent/s and will activate the naming algorithm before updating it to 
        the DNS. The naming algorithm is used to make sure that the names 
        are unique in link. 
      
      
     3.4.1 Naming 
         
        The unique feature of HNRP protocol is the naming of the IPv6 nodes. 
        HNRP allows the users to set their preferable name for their IPv6 
        node/s. Even though we don't have the control for the naming, HNRP 
        still decides whether to use the specific name given by each user to 
        their nodes. System administrator also has a choice whether to use 
        this algorithm or manually configure the names. He also can use both 
        manual and the approach described in this document.   
         
        The resolver uses first come first serve basis in the naming 
        algorithm. If there is a conflict of names between 2 IPv6 nodes, the 
        node that register first will be given the name. For the second 
        node, a new name will be generated using the name given by the node. 
        For example if the conflict name is _ipv6-dns_, then the algorithm 
        will assign a new name for the second node based on that conflict 
        name such as _ipv6-dns-2_. In this way the each node will still have 
        a unique name. 
          
        This is different from the approach by Kitamura [3]. In the approach 
        by Kitamura, the naming is still handled by system administrator and 
        no freedom given to each user. The second approach, in the document 
        uses predefined named which the registrar randomly generates. He 
        also uses a method to detect the names automatically but in the 
        method described, all the nodes must define a special MIB. This is 
        difficult because it involve both the server and the client (nodes). 
         
        To make the protocol simpler, we only use 2 methods, which is either 
        configured by system administrator for fix name for an IPv6 node or 
        use the name given by the node.  
      
      
     3.4.2 Naming algorithm 
         
        Resolver Check the Host name file given by the agent 
               Check IP address in file 
               If IP is new 
                    Check name in file 
                         If name is new 
                         Update name and IP to the DNS

     3.5 Location of Host Name Resolution Protocol (HNRP) 
         
        The resolver need to be placed together with the DNS while the agent 
        need to be placed with the router. Using this method, each link will 
        have an agent, which is manually configured to directly communicate 
        with the resolver. This kind of implementation is important because 
        the router will drop the DAD packet from going out of it.

        agent will dynamically get all the names and update the resolver 
        from time to time. The resolver using will update the DNS with this

        Figure 2 shows the implementation where one DNS is shared among 
        nodes from different LANs. In this scenario, each LAN will have an 
        agent that will communicate directly with the resolver. To avoid the 
        conflict of names from different LAN, each agent will make a copy of 
        host name files from the resolver. In the case of multiple agent 
        accessing the resolver at the same time, the protocol will allow the 
        first agent to update the changes to the resolver. It will be first 
        come first server basis. In this case the naming of nodes will be 
        organized without the names conflicting with other nodes from 
        different LAN/s. 
      
      
      
     4. Conclusion 
         
        The implementation of Host Name Resolution Protocol is aimed to 
        solve two major problems discussed above. In the future the 
        capability of HNRP by adding more function and make it more secure 
        in transmitting the data.

     5. Security Consideration 
         
        Security is one of the main issues in developing HNRP. Since the 
        agent directly sends the information to the resolver, the 
        information must be send securely (e.g., IPsec). The other 
        communication part that needs to be sent securely is between the 
        resolver and the DNS.  
         
        It also must make sure that the message send by the agent are from 
        the agent that is registered with the resolver. If not the data 
        should be ignored. This is to make sure that no malicious data being 
        send to the resolver.  
         
        The security issue for HNRP is need to be discussed further.
