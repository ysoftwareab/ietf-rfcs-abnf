1.  Introduction

1.1.  Setting up ID value uniquely identifying the body

   A SIP message consists of a start-line, one or more header fields, an
   empty line indicating the end of the header fields, and an optional
   message-body, as specified in [RFC3261].

   A message-body of the SIP message can contain one body only or can
   contain several bodies, as specified in [RFC3261].

   When the message-body of the SIP message contains several bodies,
   each body is included in a body part encoded using [RFC2045] format
   in the message-body of the SIP message, as specified in [RFC5621].  A
   body part encoded using [RFC2045] format can contain a Content-ID
   header field with an ID value uniquely identifying the body part, as
   specified in [RFC2045].

   However, when the message-body of the SIP message contains one body
   only, there are no body parts and there is also no defined method how
   to convey an ID value uniquely identifying the body part.  Also, the
   Content-ID header field is not a defined SIP header field and thus

Internet-Draft              Content-ID-in-SIP                August 2016


   the Content-ID header field cannot be included in the header fields
   of a SIP message.

1.2.  Referencing the ID value uniquely identifying the body

   A SIP header field can contain a reference to a body part using a
   Content-ID URL, as specified in [RFC5621].

   The Content-ID URL is specified in [RFC2392].  [RFC2392] also
   specifies how to discover the body part referenced by a Content-ID
   URL.

   Examples of a SIP header field referencing a body part using a
   Content-ID URL are:

   o  [RFC6442] specifies how a Geolocation header field references a
      body part using a Content-ID URL, for providing location.
   o  [RFC5368] specifies how a Refer-To header field references a body
      part using a Content-ID URL, to provide a list of targets.

1.3.  Problem statement

   Since the Content-ID header field is not a defined SIP header field:

   o  When solely one body needs to be transported in a SIP message, if
      a UAC does not need to include in the SIP message a SIP header
      field referencing the body part, the UAC sets the message-body to
      the body.
   o  However, when solely one body needs to be transported in a SIP
      message, if a UAC needs to include in the SIP message a SIP header
      field referencing the body part, then the UAC needs to include the
      body in a body part encoded using the [RFC2045] format.  I.e., the
      UAC sets the message-body using [RFC2045] format and includes one
      body part with the body and associated Content-ID header field.

1.4.  Examples of the problem

1.4.1.  Example 1

   If a UAC sends an INVITE request conveying location as specified in
   [RFC6442], if the UAC decides not to include an SDP offer, and if the
   location is conveyed by value, then the UAC needs to include one body
   only in the INVITE request.

   This body contains the location information and can be e.g. of the
   application/pidf+xml MIME type.

Internet-Draft              Content-ID-in-SIP                August 2016


   However, due to [RFC6442] requiring inclusion of a Geolocation header
   field referencing the body part with the body containing the location
   information, the UAC needs to include a message-body of multipart/
   mixed MIME type in the INVITE request, and the UAC needs to include a
   body part with the application/pidf+xml body and associated Content-
   ID header field in the multipart/mixed body.

1.4.2.  Example 2

   If a UAC sends an REFER request including a list of targets as
   specified in [RFC5368], then the UAC needs to include one body only
   in the REFER request.

   This body contains the list of targets and is of the application/
   resource-lists+xml MIME type.

   However, due to [RFC5368] requiring inclusion of a Refer-To header
   field referencing the body part containing the list of targets, the
   UAC needs to include a message-body of the multipart/mixed MIME type
   in the REFER request and the UE needs to include a body part with the
   application/resource-lists+xml body and associated Content-ID header
   field in the multipart/mixed body.

1.5.  Solution

   To avoid the unnecessary usage of the [RFC2045] format when only one
   body needs to be included in a SIP message, this document specifies a
   Content-ID header field as a SIP header field.

   The Content-ID header field included in header fields of a SIP
   message identifies a body part consisting of the message-body of the
   SIP message and:

   o  a Content-Disposition header field;
   o  a Content-Encoding header field;
   o  a Content-Language header field;
   o  a Content-Length header field;
   o  a Content-Type header field; and
   o  a Content-ID header field;

   included in the header fields of the SIP message.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Content-ID header field

3.1.  Introduction

   This section defines the usage of the Content-ID header field for
   SIP.

3.2.  Syntax

   The ABNF for the Content-ID header fields is:

   Content-ID = "Content-ID" HCOLON msg-id

   NOTE: msg-id is specified in [RFC5322].

3.3.  Semantic

   A Content-ID header field included in header fields of a SIP message
   indicates a globally unique identification of a body part consisting
   of the message-body of the SIP message and:

   o  a Content-Disposition header field;
   o  a Content-Encoding header field;
   o  a Content-Language header field;
   o  a Content-Length header field;
   o  a Content-Type header field; and
   o  a Content-ID header field;

   included in header fields of the SIP message.

   The Content-ID header field can be included in any SIP message which
   is allowed to contain a message-body.

3.4.  Procedures

3.4.1.  UA procedures

   A UA MAY include a Content-ID header field in any SIP message which
   is allowed to contain a message-body.

   A UA MUST NOT include a Content-ID header field in any SIP message
   which is not allowed to contain a message-body.

   The UA MUST set the value of the Content-ID header field to a
   globally unique value.

Internet-Draft              Content-ID-in-SIP                August 2016


3.4.2.  Proxy procedures

   A proxy MUST NOT add a Content-ID header field in a SIP message.

   A proxy MUST NOT modify a Content-ID header field included in a SIP
   message.

   A proxy MUST NOT delete a Content-ID header field from a SIP message.

4.  Security Considerations

   The Content-ID header field value MUST NOT reveal sensitive user
   information.

   If the message-body associated with the Content-ID header field
   contains encrypted content, it MUST NOT be possible to derive a key
   that can be used to decrypt the message-body content from the
   Content-ID header field value.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers a new SIP header field according to the
   procedures in [RFC3261].
