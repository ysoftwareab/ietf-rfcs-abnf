                  draft-palle-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp-01

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) has been identified as an
   appropriate technology for the determination of the paths of point-
   to-multipoint (P2MP) TE LSPs.  [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-app]
   presents several use cases, demonstrating scenarios that benefit from
   the deployment of a stateful PCE.  [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
   provides the fundamental PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions
   needed to support stateful PCE functions.  This memo provides
   extensions required for PCEP so as to enable the usage of a stateful
   PCE capability in supporting point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE LSPs.

1.  Introduction

   As per [RFC4655], the Path Computation Element (PCE) is an entity
   that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
   network graph, and applying computational constraints.  A Path
   Computation Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be
   computed.

   [RFC4857] describes how to set up point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) for use in Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.  The
   PCE has been identified as a suitable application for the computation
   of paths for P2MP TE LSPs ([RFC5671]).

   The PCEP is designed as a communication protocol between PCCs and
   PCEs for point-to-point (P2P) path computations and is defined in
   [RFC5440].  The extensions of PCEP to request path computation for
   P2MP TE LSPs are described in [RFC6006].

   Stateful PCEs are shown to be helpful in many application scenarios,
   in both MPLS and GMPLS networks, as illustrated in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-app].  These scenarios apply equally to
   P2P and P2MP TE LSPs.  [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] provides the
   fundamental extensions needed for stateful PCE to support general
   functionality for P2P TE LSP.  Complementarily, this document focuses
   on the extensions that are necessary in order for the deployment of
   stateful PCEs to support P2MP TE LSPs.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   Terminology used in this document is same as terminology used in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and [RFC6006].

3.  Supporting P2MP TE LSP for Stateful PCE

3.1.  Motivation

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-app] presents several use cases,
   demonstrating scenarios that benefit from the deployment of a
   stateful PCE including optimization, recovery, etc.
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] defines the extensions to PCEP for P2P TE
   LSPs in applying these scenarios.  But these scenarios apply equally
   to P2MP TE LSPs as well.

   In addition to that, the stateful nature of a PCE simplifies the
   information conveyed in PCEP messages since it is possible to refer
   to the LSPs via PLSP-ID.  For P2MP this is an added advantage, where
   the size of message is much larger.  Incase of stateless PCE, a
   modification of P2MP tree requires encoding of all leaves along with
   the paths in PCReq message, but using a stateful PCE with P2MP
   capability, the PCEP message can be used to convey only the
   modifications (the other information can be retrieved from the LSP
   identifier).

3.2.  Objectives

   The objectives for the protocol extensions to support P2MP TE LSP for
   stateful PCE are same as the objectives described in section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].

4.  Functions to Support P2MP TE LSPs for Stateful PCEs

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] specifies new functions to support a
   stateful PCE.  It also specifies that a function can be initiated
   either from a PCC towards a PCE (C-E) or from a PCE towards a PCC
   (E-C).

   This document extends these functions to support P2MP TE LSPs.

   Capability Advertisement (E-C,C-E):  both the PCC and the PCE must
      announce during PCEP session establishment that they support PCEP
      Stateful PCE extensions for P2MP using mechanisms defined in
      [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and [RFC6006].

   LSP State Synchronization (C-E):  after the session between the PCC
      and a stateful PCE with P2MP capability is initialized, the PCE
      must learn the state of a PCC's P2MP TE LSPs before it can perform
      path computations or update LSP attributes in a PCC.

   LSP Update Request (E-C):  a stateful PCE with P2MP capability
      requests modification of attributes on a PCC's P2MP TE LSP.

Internet-Draft                STATEFUL-P2MP                 January 2014


   LSP State Report (C-E):  a PCC sends an LSP state report to a PCE
      whenever the state of a P2MP TE LSP changes.

   LSP Control Delegation (C-E,E-C):  a PCC grants to a PCE the right to
      update LSP attributes on one or more P2MP TE LSPs; the PCE becomes
      the authoritative source of the LSP's attributes as long as the
      delegation is in effect (See Section 5.5 of
      [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]); the PCC may withdraw the delegation
      or the PCE may give up the delegation at any time.

   [I-D.sivabalan-pce-disco-stateful] and [RFC6006] defines the IGP
   extensions needed to support autodiscovery of stateful PCEs with P2MP
   capability.

5.  Architectural Overview of Protocol Extensions

5.1.  Extension of PCEP Messages

   New PCEP messages are defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] to
   support stateful PCE for P2P TE LSPs.  In this document these
   messages are extended to support P2MP TE LSPs.

   Path Computation State Report (PCRpt):  Each P2MP TE LSP State Report
      in a PCRpt message can contain actual P2MP TE LSP path attributes,
      LSP status, etc.  An LSP State Report carried on a PCRpt message
      is also used in delegation or revocation of control of a P2MP TE
      LSP to/from a PCE.  The extension of PCRpt message is described in
      Section 7.1.

   Path Computation Update Request (PCUpd):  Each P2MP TE LSP Update
      Request in a PCUpd message MUST contain all LSP parameters that a
      PCE wishes to set for a given P2MP TE LSP.  An LSP Update Request
      carried on a PCUpd message is also used to return LSP delegations
      if at any point PCE no longer desires control of a P2MP TE LSP.
      The PCUpd message is described in Section 7.2.

5.2.  Capability Advertisement

   During PCEP Initialization Phase, as per Section 7.1.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce], PCEP speakers advertises Stateful
   capability via Stateful PCE Capability TLV in open message and as per
   Section 3.1 of [RFC6006], PCE advertises P2MP capability via IGP
   discovery or a P2MP capable TLV in open message.  These mechanism
   when used together indicates a stateful PCE with P2MP capability.

Internet-Draft                STATEFUL-P2MP                 January 2014


5.3.  State Synchronization

   State Synchronization operations described in Section 5.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] are applicable for P2MP TE LSPs as well.

5.4.  LSP Delegation

   LSP delegation operations described in Section 5.5 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] are applicable for P2MP TE LSPs as well.

5.5.  LSP Operations

5.5.1.  Passive Stateful PCE

   LSP operations for passive stateful PCE described in Section 5.6.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] are applicable for P2MP TE LSPs as well.

   The Path Computation Request and Response message format for P2MP TE
   LSPs is as per Section 3.4 and Section 3.5 of [RFC6006] respectively.

   [Editor's Note: The Request and Response message should support LSP
   object, so that it is possible to refer to a LSP with a unique
   identifier and simplify the PCEP message exchange. for example,
   incase of modification of one leaf in a P2MP tree, there should be no
   need to carry the full P2MP tree in PCReq message.]

5.5.2.  Active Stateful PCE

   LSP operations for active stateful PCE described in Section 5.6.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] are applicable for P2MP TE LSPs as well.

6.  PCEP Object Extensions

   The PCEP TLV defined in this document is compliant with the PCEP TLV
   format defined in [RFC5440].

6.1.  Extension of LSP Object

   LSP Object is defined in Section 7.3 of [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].
   This document adds the following flags to the LSP Object:

   N (P2MP bit):  If the bit is set to 1, it specifies the message is
      for P2MP TE LSP which MUST be set in PCRpt or PCUpd message for a
      P2MP TE LSP.

   F (Fragmentation bit):  If the bit is set to 1, it specifies the
      message is fragmented.

Internet-Draft                STATEFUL-P2MP                 January 2014


   If P2MP bit is set, the following P2MP-LSP-IDENTIFIER TLV MUST be
   present in LSP object.

6.2.  P2MP-LSP-IDENTIFIER TLV

   The P2MP LSP Identifier TLV MUST be included in the LSP object in
   PCRpt message for RSVP-signaled P2MP TE LSPs.  If the TLV is missing,
   the PCE will generate an error with error-type 6 (mandatory object
   missing) and error-value TBD (12) (P2MP-LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV missing)
   and close the PCEP session.

   The P2MP LSP Identifier TLV MAY be included in the LSP object in
   PCUpd message for RSVP-signaled P2MP TE LSPs.  The special value of
   all zeros for this TLV is used to refer to all paths pertaining to a
   particular PLSP-ID.

   There are two P2MP LSP Identifier TLVs, one for IPv4 and one for
   IPv6.

   The format of the IPV4-P2MP-LSP-IDENTIFIER TLV is shown in the
   following figure:

7.  PCEP Message Extensions

7.1.  The PCRpt Message

   As per Section 6.1 of [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce], PCRpt message is
   used to report the current state of a P2P TE LSP.  This document
   extends the PCRpt message in reporting the status of P2MP TE LSP.

   The format of PCRpt message is as follows:

                 [<path>]

      <attribute-list> is defined in [RFC5440] and extended
      by PCEP extensions.

   The END-POINTS object defined in [RFC6006] is mandatory for
   specifying address of P2MP leaves.

   Note that we preserve compatibility with the
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] definition of <state-report>.  At least
   one instance of <END-POINTS> MUST be present in this message.

   [Editor Note: suggest to add <END-POINTS> object mandatory in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] document for <state-report>].

7.2.  The PCUpd Message

   As per Section 6.2 of [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce], PCUpd message is
   used to update P2P TE LSP attributes.  This document extends the
   PCUpd message in updating the attributes of P2MP TE LSP.

   The format of a PCUpd message is as follows:

      <path> ::= (<ERO>|<SERO>)
                 [<path>]

      <attribute-list> is defined in [RFC5440] and extended
      by PCEP extensions.

   Note that we preserve compatibility with the
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] definition of <update-request>.

7.3.  Example

7.3.1.  P2MP TE LSP Update Request

   LSP Update Request message is sent by an active stateful PCE to
   update the P2MP TE LSP parameters or attributes.  An example of a
   PCUpd message for P2MP TE LSP is described below:

              Common Header
          SRP
              LSP with P2MP flag set
              END-POINTS for leaf type 3
                ERO list

   In this example, a stateful PCE request updation of path taken by
   some of the leaves in a P2MP tree.  The update request uses the END-
   POINT type 3 (modified/reoptimized).  The ERO list represents the S2L
   path after modification.  The update message does not need to encode
   the full P2MP tree in this case.

7.3.2.  P2MP TE LSP Report

   LSP State Report message is sent by a PCC to report or delegate the
   P2MP TE LSP.  An example of a PCRpt message for P2MP TE LSP is
   described below to add new leaves to an existing P2MP TE LSP:

              Common Header
              LSP with P2MP flag set
              END-POINTS for leaf type 1
                ERO list

   An example of a PCRpt message for P2MP TE LSP is described below to
   prune leaves from an existing P2MP TE LSP:

              Common Header
              LSP with P2MP flag set
              END-POINTS for leaf type 2
                ERO list (empty)

   An example of a PCRpt message for P2MP TE LSP is described below to
   report status of modified leaves in an existing P2MP TE LSP:

              Common Header
              LSP with P2MP flag set
              END-POINTS for leaf type 3
                ERO list

7.4.  Report and Update Message Fragmentation

   The total PCEP message length, including the common header, is 16
   bytes.  In certain scenarios the P2MP report and update request may
   not fit into a single PCEP message (initial report or update).  The
   F-bit is used in the LSP object to signal that the initial report or
   update was too large to fit into a single message and will be
   fragmented into multiple messages.  In order to identify the single
   report or update, each message will use the same PLSP-ID.

   Fragmentation procedure described below for report or update message
   is similar to [RFC6006] which describes request and response message
   fragmentation.

7.4.1.  Report Fragmentation Procedure

   If the initial report is too large to fit into a single report
   message, the PCC will split the report over multiple messages.  Each
   message sent to the PCE, except the last one, will have the F-bit set
   in the LSP object to signify that the report has been fragmented into
   multiple messages.  In order to identify that a series of report



Palle & Dhody             Expires July 29, 2014                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                STATEFUL-P2MP                 January 2014


   messages represents a single report, each message will use the same
   PLSP-ID.

7.4.2.  Update Fragmentation Procedure

   Once the PCE computes and updates a path for some or all leaves in a
   P2MP TE LSP, an update message is sent to the PCC.  If the update is
   too large to fit into a single update message, the PCE will split the
   update over multiple messages.  Each update message sent by the PCE,
   except the last one, will have the F-bit set in the LSP object to
   signify that the update has been fragmented into multiple messages.
   In order to identify that a series of update messages represents a
   single update, each message will use the same PLSP-ID and SRP-ID-
   number.

   [Editor Note: P2MP message fragmentation errors associated with a
   P2MP path report and update will be defined in future version].

8.  Non-Support of P2MP TE LSPs for Stateful PCE

   The PCEP protocol extensions described in this document for stateful
   PCEs with P2MP capability MUST NOT be used if PCE has not advertised
   its stateful capability with P2MP as per Section 5.2.  If this is not
   the case and Stateful operations on P2MP TE LSPs are attempted, then
   a PCErr with error-type 19 (Invalid Operation) and error-value TBD
   needs to be generated.

   If a Stateful PCE receives a P2MP TE LSP report message and it
   understands the P2MP flag in the LSP object, but the stateful PCE is
   not capable of P2MP computation, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message
   with error-type 19 (Invalid Operation) and error-value TBD.

   If a Stateful PCE receives a P2MP TE LSP report message and the PCE
   does not understand the P2MP flag in the LSP object, and therefore
   the PCEP extensions described in this document, then the PCE SHOULD
   reject the request.

   [Editor Note: more information on exact error value is needed]
