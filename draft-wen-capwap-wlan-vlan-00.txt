Abstract

   In Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points Protocol, the
   WLANs on the Wireless Termination Point are created by the Access 
   Controller with the appropriate setting. This document defines a mew
   messages elements, i.e., WLAN-VLAN Information message element, which
   is used to set WLAN-VLAN binding information on the WTP.

1.  Introduction

   In the centralized WLAN architecture [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-
   specification], WTPs can be inter-connected via Distribution System 
   (DS),which is constructed by Ethernet technology. On each WTP, more
   than one WLAN can be defined by the AC via multiple IEEE 802.11 Add
   WLAN message element [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-binding-ieee80211].
   The operator of centralized WLAN network could provide differentiated
   services to the stations connected to different kind of WLANs. The
   local-MAC mode with local bridging method (i.e., the traffic can
   locally switched) is more efficient for traffic delivery and can
   offload from the Access Controller (AC), so it attracts more
   attention. However, the traffic sending from the northbound interface
   of the WTP has lost all the WLAN information; in fact, the traffic
   from different WLAN on the WTP may have different requirements (e.g.,
   priority, throughput) on the DS, so in order to provide better
   control and management on the traffic belonging to different WLAN
   from the WTP, the traffic identification and segregation from the
   northbound interface of the WTP is needed.

   The traffic related to different WLAN can be tagged with different
   VLAN tag. This document defines WLAN-VLAN Information message element
   , which is used by the AC to create the WLAN on the WTP with the
   appropriate VLAN information. In fact, there is one-to-one mapping
   between SSID, WLAN and VLAN. This VLAN is useful when local bridging
   is deployed in the network. 

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-
   specification] and [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-binding-ieee80211].

2.  CAPWAP WLAN-VLAN Information

   The WLAN-VLAN Information message element accompanies the IEEE 802.11
   Add WLAN message element, and is used to deliver the binding 
   information of WLAN and VLAN to the WTP for the local-MAC mode which
   works with local bridging method.

   The traffic received from this specified WLAN will be sent by the WTP
   with the VLAN information specified in this WLAN-VLAN Information
   message element. The traffic on the path from the northbound
   interface of the WTP is segregated by VLAN technology.
   
   The CAPWAP WLAN-VLAN Information message element for CAPWAP
   IEEE802.11 has the format shown in the following figure:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |    Radio ID   |   WLAN ID     |        VLAN tag               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         VLAN tag              |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type:   WLAN_VLAN_INFO (TBD)

   Length:   = 8

   Radio ID:   An 8-bit value representing the radio

   WLAN ID:   An 8-bit value specifying the WLAN Identifier

   VLAN tag:  4-byte. there are 2 bytes for 802.1q type identfier with
      a fixed value of 0x8100, 3-bit user priority, 1-bit canonical
      format (CFI indicator), and 12-bit VLAN identifier.

   Usage:
   This information element is an optional message element and
   will be used in WLAN Configuration Request in association with Add
   WLAN Message element.

3.  Type Value Consideration

   The following Message Element type value for CAPWAP WLAN-VLAN
   Information message element MUST be assigned

     Message Element                            Value
     -----------------------------------------------------------
     CAPWAP WLAN-VLAN Information         WLAN_VLAN_INFO


4.  IANA Consideration

   This document has no actions for IANA. 


5. Security Considerations

   There is no more security issue introduced by this message element.
