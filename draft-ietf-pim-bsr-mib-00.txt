Internet-Draft                 PIM BSR MIB                   August 2006


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Bootstrap Router (BSR) mechanism for PIM.  [I-D.ietf-pim-sm-v2-new],
   [I-D.ietf-pim-sm-bsr].

   This document was created by moving some of the PIM BSR specific MIB
   tables from one of the earlier version of PIM MIB draft [I-D.ietf-
   pim-mib-v2].


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410[RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


4.  Overview

   This MIB module contains four tables.  The tables are:

   1.  The BSR Candidate-RP Table, which contains one row for each
       multicast group address prefix for which the local router is to
       advertise itself as a Candidate-RP.

   2.  The BSR Elected BSR RP-Set Table, which contains one row for each
       Group-to-RP mapping that was received in C-RP advertisements.

Internet-Draft                 PIM BSR MIB                   August 2006


   3.  The BSR Candidate-BSR Table, which contains one row for each
       Candidate-BSR configuration for the local router.

   4.  The BSR Elected BSR Table, which contains one row for each
       elected BSR.

   This MIB module uses textual conventions defined in the IF-MIB
   [RFC2863], the INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001] and the IANA-RTPROTO-MIB.

6.  Security Considerations

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is still no control over whom on the secure network is allowed
   to access (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.
   The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   In this MIB module, possible effects that can be induced by SET
   operations on writable objects include:

   o  A new Candidate BSR with high priority or modification of priority
      of an existing candidate BSR can takeover the functionality of
      Elected BSR which can prevent and disrupt the services.

   o  A new Candidate RP with lower priority or modification of priority
      of an existing Candidate RP can force other routers to select
      itself for a particular group prefix.  This can prevent and



Joshi & Bijlani         Expires February 24, 2007              [Page 17]

Internet-Draft                 PIM BSR MIB                   August 2006


      disrupt the services provided through this group prefix.

   The following are the read-write and read-create objects defined in
   this MIB module:

   bsrCandidateRPBidir
   bsrCandidateRPPriority
   bsrCandidateRPAdvInterval
   bsrCandidateRPHoldtime
   bsrCandidateBSRAddressType
   bsrCandidateBSRAddress
   bsrCandidateBSRPriority
   bsrCandidateBSRHashMaskLength

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   In this MIB module, possible effects that can be induced by GET
   and/or NOTIFY operations include:

   o  Determination of Elected BSR, Candidate BSRs and Candidate RPs in
      the Multicast Network topology.  This information may be sensitive
      and may be used in preparation for DoS attacks including any of
      the attacks described above.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is still no control over whom on the secure network is allowed
   to access (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to access (read/change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   PIM-BSR-MIB should be rooted under the mib-2 subtree.  IANA is
   requested to assign { mib-2 XXX } to the PIM-BSR-MIB module specified
   in this document.
