INTERNET-DRAFT            ECML v2 Requirements             February 2001


1. Introduction

   ECML Version 2.0 will describe the syntax of a class of data objects
   called Payment Processing Objects. This will involve the development
   a hierarchically organized set of data elements and an XML syntax for
   payment transaction information for both electronic wallets and
   Business to Business [B2B] payment types such as credit card, check,
   line of credit, ACH (Automated Clearing House,) Mobile Phone
   Payments, and PDA Payments.

   This document lists the design principles, scope, and requirements
   over three things: (1) the scope of work available to the WG, (2) the
   ECML version 2 specification, and (3) applications that implement the
   specification. It includes requirements as they relate to the payment
   element syntax, data model, format, implementation, and external
   requirements. Those things that are required are designated as
   "must", those things that are optional are designated by "may", those
   things that are optional but recommended are designated as "should".



1.1 Relationship to Other Standards

   The set of fields documented herein was started by the ECML Alliance
   [ECML] which developed the North American / HTML form field oriented
   Version 1 of ECML [RFC 2706, v1.1].  Control and development of
   future versions of the standard has been transferred to the IETF.

   The ECML Version 1 fields were initially derived from and are
   consistent with the W3C P3P base data schema [P3P BASE].  Version 2
   extends the fields provided to encompass [P3P ECOM] and selected
   additional fields from [ISO 8583], [JCM], or other sources.

   ECML Version 2.0 is not a replacement or alternative to TLS [RFC
   2246], SET [SET], EMV [EMV], XML [XML], or IOTP [RFC 2801]. These are
   important standards that provide functionality such as
   confidentiality, non-repudiatable transactions, automatable payment
   scheme selection, and smart card support.



2. Design Principles and Scope

   1. The specification must describe the fields necessary to process a
      payment describing the XML syntax and content in particular.

   2. Keep the addition of fields beyond those in ECML v1.1 [RFC v1.1]
      to a minimum.

   3. Maintain all existing functionality from ECML v1.1.


J. Parsons, D. Shepherd, D. Eastlake                            [Page 3]


INTERNET-DRAFT            ECML v2 Requirements             February 2001


   4. Increase the flexibility of the standard to include other forms of
      payments.  These include ACH, Mobile Phone, PDA, Line of Credit,
      Purchasing Card and eCheck. See [P3P ECOM, JCM], etc.

   5. Allow for use of the common and uniform DTD with back-end payment
      systems such as Enterprise Resource Provision [ERP], Card Line
      Item Detail [LID] Level II & Level III, etc.

   6. Allow for use of the standard with B2B payment vehicles, such as
      B2B Wallets, Marketplaces, etc.

   7. Test all XML DTDs and XML examples in the specification to insure
      that they are well-formed XML.

   8. Create an usage/implementation guide section of the specification
      to cover additional use cases for functionality included.

   9. ECML version 2 may include the concept of an offer.

   10. ECML version 2 should be developed as part of the broader Web
      design philosophy of decentralization, URIs, Web data, modularity
      /layering / extensibility, and assertions as statements about
      statements. [Berners-Lee, WebData] In this context, this standard
      should take advantage of existing provider (and infrastructure)
      primitives.



3. Requirements



3.1 Payment Processing Elements

      1. Cost
      2. Receipt
      3. Currency
      4. Card
      5. Payment
      6. Bank/Telco



3.2 Payment Processing Types

      1. All current Processing types for ECML 1.1
      2. ACH
      3. eCheck
      4. Line Of Credit (LOC)
      5. Mobile phone payments

INTERNET-DRAFT            ECML v2 Requirements             February 2001


      6. PDA payments



3.3 XML Data Model and Syntax

      1. A well-formed DTD needs to be developed to include new fields
         in this standard.

      2. W3C Schema note may be drafted to document changes to the
         schema.



3.4 Implementation

      1. The ECML version 2 specification should meet the requirements
         of the following applications:
            1. Internet Open Trading Protocol v1.0 [IOTP]
            2. Others ???

      2. Check against representative LOC, ACH, eCheck, Mobile Phone and
         PDA processes.

      3. Compare completeness against (in accordance with standard's
         goals:)
            1. [ECML v1.1]
            2. [P3P NOTE]
            3. [ISO 8583]
            4. [JCM]
            5. cXML
            6. EBXML
            7. BizTalk



3.5 Detailed Requests

   The following are specific comments received on claimed deficiencies
   in ECML v1.1 and should all be considered for possible inclusion in
   ECML v2.

      1. Increase Last Name field minimum required support to at least
         22 characters.

      2. Improved Internationalization support.

      3. Longer minimum supported telephone number and email fields.

      4. Provide a "translation field" which would specify a mapping


J. Parsons, D. Shepherd, D. Eastlake                            [Page 5]


INTERNET-DRAFT            ECML v2 Requirements             February 2001


         between existing fields and ECML specified fields.  The
         addition of such a field in ECML v2 (which would normally be
         hidden when presented in HTML) would permit ECML support with
         no change to existing fields or code.  ECML code could fill in
         existing fields based on the ECML field they map to.



4. Security Considerations

   Some ECML fields contain sensitive private information.  ECML is
   dependent upon the security of the infrastructure of transmission
   providers that use the standard format.  ECML does not add any
   security to this infrastructure.  See the ECML v2 specification for
   more detailed privacy and security considerations.
