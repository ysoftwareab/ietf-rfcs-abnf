Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) extensions for suppressing
                          connectivity checks
            draft-veikkolainen-mmusic-ice-suppress-checks-00

Abstract

   Connectivity checks as proposed by Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) are used to detect problems that cause endpoints
   not to receive media.  However, in some cases connectivity checks are
   not seen as necessary, or such checks are not feasible for certain
   bearer types.

   This document defines a new candidate address type for which
   connectivity checks are not performed.

Internet-Draft   Suppressing connectivity checks in ICE     October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Interactive Connectivity Establishment, ICE, [RFC5245] defines
   connectivity checks as a mechanism to ensure that media path can be
   used between two endpoints.

   There are however cases when connectivity checks are not needed or
   they may not be possible.  [I-D.boucadair-mmusic-altc] and
   [I-D.hutton-mmusic-icemicrolite] argue that ICE is overly complex in
   certain deployment cases, and that a simpler alternative to full-
   blown ICE would be desired.  One component creating this complexity
   are the connectivity checks.

   Also, [I-D.wing-dispatch-v6-migration] proposes a mechanism for
   migrating to IPv6 networks whereby connectivity checks may be
   bypassed by simultaneously sending media over IPv4 and IPv6 thus
   probing which of the media paths is operational.

   Media is usually transported using RTP, but other possibilities exist
   as well.  [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-cs] defines conventions for describing
   circuit-switched bearers in SDP.  When such a circuit-switched bearer
   is used as a candidate address in ICE, connectivity checks are not
   feasible due to the nature of the circuit-switched bearer.

   This document defines an extension to ICE for suppressing
   connectivity checks for certain candidate addresses.  Implementations
   conforming to this document do not perform connectivity checks for
   these candidate addresses, but rather indicate the checks as having
   been successful when going through the ICE process of creating
   candidate pairs.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant
   implementations.


3.  Overview of operation

   An Full ICE (see Section 3 of [RFC5245]) implementation may be aware
   of certain candidate addresses for which connectivity checks need not
   be used.  The agent indicates these kind of candidate addresses with
   a new candidate address type, "Suppressed host candidate", defined in
   this document.

Internet-Draft   Suppressing connectivity checks in ICE     October 2010


   For candidate addresses which are of type Suppressed host candidate,
   no connectivity checks are performed.  Instead, they are treated
   during the ICE process as having successfully completed the
   connectivity checking, and resulted in Succeeded state when forming
   the Check List.


4.  Protocol Description

   For convenience, we use the same section structure as in [RFC5245]
   Sections 4, 5, and 6, even if in many cases there are no
   modifications to the original procedures.

4.1.  Sending the initial offer

4.1.1.  Gathering candidates

   An agent gathers candidates according to Section 4.1 of [RFC5245]
   with the following additions.

   Any host candidate for which an agent wishes not to use connectivity
   checks should be declared as "Suppressed host candidate" type.

   As discussed in Section 4.1.1.2 of [RFC5245], use of STUN or TURN
   servers and thus Server Reflexive and Relayed Candidates may be
   unnecessary in closed networks where agents are never connected to
   the public Internet or to endpoints outside of the closed network.
   Therefore, only host candidates are likely to be defined as
   Suppressed host candidates.

   The criteria for declaring a host candidate as Suppressed host
   candidate is outside the scope of this document.  However, it is
   RECOMMENDED that this criteria is configurable and could thus be
   modified if the conditions change in the future.

4.1.2.  Prioritizing

   Prioritizing candidates follows the procedures defined in Section
   4.1.2 of [RFC5245].

4.1.3.  Eliminating redundant candidates

   Eliminating redundant candidates follows the procedures defined in
   Section 4.1.3 of [RFC5245].

Internet-Draft   Suppressing connectivity checks in ICE     October 2010


4.1.4.  Choosing default candidates

   Choosing default candidates follows the procedures defined in Section
   4.1.4 of [RFC5245].

4.1.5.  Encoding the SDP

   Encoding the SDP follows the procedures defined in Section 4.3 of
   [RFC5245] with the following additions.

   The type of each candidate attribute for which an endpoint wishes to
   suppress connectivity checks is set to Suppressed host candidate
   using the token "suppr".  The SDP encoding rules are defined in
   Section 5.

   An agent which sets some candidate addresses as Suppressed host
   candidates MUST include the value "suppressed-candidates" in the ice-
   options attribute in the Initial Offer.

4.2.  Receiving the Initial Offer

4.2.1.  Verifying ICE support

   Verifying ICE support follows the procedures defined in Section 5.1
   of [RFC5245].

4.2.2.  Determining role

   Determining role follows the procedures defined in Section 5.2 of
   [RFC5245].

4.2.3.  Gathering candidates

   Choosing default candidates follows the procedures defined in Section
   5.3 of [RFC5245].

4.2.4.  Prioritizing candidates

   Choosing default candidates follows the procedures defined in Section
   5.4 of [RFC5245].

4.2.5.  Choosing default candidates

   Choosing default candidates follows the procedures defined in Section
   5.5 of [RFC5245].

4.2.6.  Encoding the SDP

   The process for encodig the SDP for the Initial Answer is identical
   to the process followed by the offerer, as described in
   Section 4.1.5.

4.2.7.  Forming the check lists

   Forming check lists follows the procedures defined in Section 4.1.4
   of [RFC5245] with the following additions.

   For candidate address pairs which are of type Suppressed host
   candidates, the state assigned MUST be Succeeded, as if the
   connectivity checks for those candidate pairs was already completed.

   An agent MUST NOT perform connectivity checks for pairs that are of
   type Suppressed host candidate.

4.3.  Receipt of the Initial Answer

4.3.1.  Verifying ICE support

   Verifying ICE support follows the procedures defined in Section 6.1
   of [RFC5245].

4.3.2.  Determining role

   Determining role follows the procedures defined in Section 6.2 of
   [RFC5245].

4.3.3.  Forming the check list

   The offerer follows the same procedures described for the answerer in
   Section 4.2.7.

4.3.4.  Performing ordinary checks

   The procedures defined in Section 7 of [RFC5245] are followed, except
   for candidate addresses which are of type Suppressed host candidate,
   for which connectivity checks MUST NOT be performed.

4.4.  Concluding ICE

   The agents follow the procedures for Full implementations defined in
   Section 8.1 of [RFC5245].  As defined therein, if the peer is using
   ice-options which the agent does not understand, the agent MUST use a
   regular nomination algorithm.

Internet-Draft   Suppressing connectivity checks in ICE     October 2010


   If both agents use the ice-option "suppressed-candidates" defined in
   this document, the agents MAY use either the aggressive or the
   regular nomination algorithm.


5.  Extensions to SDP

5.1.  Extensions to 'candidate' attribute

   ICE defines a "candidate" attribute with the following syntax (from
   [RFC5245]):

   candidate-attribute   = "candidate" ":" foundation SP component-id SP
                           transport SP
                           priority SP
                           connection-address SP     ;from RFC 4566
                           port         ;port from RFC 4566
                           SP cand-type
                           [SP rel-addr]
                           [SP rel-port]
                           *(SP extension-att-name SP
                                extension-att-value)

   The candidate address type <cand-type> is defined with:

    cand-type             = "typ" SP candidate-types
    candidate-types       = "host" / "srflx" / "prflx" / "relay" / token

   This document extends the the candidate address type with Suppressed
   host candidate type, which has the following ABNF:

      candidate-types      /= "suppr"

5.2.  Extensions to 'ice-options' attribute

   The "ice-options" attribute is defined by the following ABNF:

   ice-options           = "ice-options" ":" ice-option-tag
                             0*(SP ice-option-tag)
   ice-option-tag        = 1*ice-char

   This document extends the "ice-options" attribute with a new value,
   "suppressed-candidates", with the following ABNF:

   ice-option-tag          /= "suppressed-candidates"

6.  IANA Considerations

   At this time, there is no registry or registration procedures defined
   for ICE option tags.  This section needs to be revised if conditions
   change in the future.


7.  Security Considerations

   The possible attacks on connectivity checks are discussed in Section
   18 of [RFC5245], including the case of False Valids.  Since the
   connectivity checking for Suppressed host candidates is declared as
   successful even if no connectivity checks are actually sent, the end
   result can be in misconfigured networks the same as for False Valid:
   a pair of agents think a candidate pair is valid even when in realiy
   it is not.  This can lead an agent to proceed with the session, but
   then not be able to receive any media.  Care must be there paid that
   Suppressed host candidates are only used in environments where
   connectivity between agents can be guaranteed without connectivity
   checks.
