Abstract

   This document defines a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   (DHCP-for-IPv4)site-specific (i.e. "Private Use") option that
   contains a list of IPv6 addresses for SIP proxy server(s) [RFC 2939].
   This list of IPv6 SIP Proxy Server(s) may be used by a 3GPP2 mobile
   to locate an IPv6 SIP Proxy Server(s), and which may additionally
   indicate the version of IP the IMS supports.

Internet-Draft    DHCP option for IPv6 SIP Proxy address   February 2004


1. Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC 2543] is an
   application-layer control protocol that can establish, modify and
   terminate multimedia sessions or calls.  A SIP system has a number of
   logical components: user agents, proxy servers, redirect servers and
   registrars.  User agents MAY contain SIP clients, proxy servers
   always do.

   This document specifies a new "Private Use", site-specific DHCP
   option [RFC 2939] that allows a 3GPP2 mobile SIP client to locate a
   local IPv6 SIP server that is to be used for all outbound SIP
   requests, a so-called outbound proxy server. The use of DHCP is one
   possible solution for locating the outbound SIP server; the use of
   specific IP Core Network bearer activation procedures (e.g. PPP in
   3GPP2), and manual configuration are other mechanisms.

   Specifically, the 3GPP2 IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) may support
   either IPv4, IPv6, or both. The SIP Proxy Server (P-CSCF) used in the
   3GPP2 IMS may also support either IPv4, IPv6, or both. If, in a 3GPP2
   network, it can be assumed that the IP version(s) supported by the
   P-CSCF is the same as the IP version(s) supported by its associated
   IMS (and that both the P-CSCF and IMS are owned by and within the
   same operator's domain), then the mobile can determine if the IMS
   supports IPv6. It is necessary to use an IPv4 DHCP message to
   discover an IPv6 SIP Proxy Server as 3GPP2 allows the support of an
   IPv6 IMS over an IPv4 transport (i.e. the IP version supported by the
   IMS is independent of the IP version used by the transport (bearer)
   network).

   This option expands on the proxy discovery mechanisms provided in RFC
   3361.

2. 3GPP2 IPv6 SIP Server Address Option

   This DHCP option will return one or more 128-bit (binary) IPv6
   address(es) that can be used by the mobile SIP client to locate an
   IPv6 SIP Proxy Server(s). The return of an IPv6 SIP Proxy Server
   address is also an indication that the (same) operator's IMS supports
   IPv6. Unlike the solution provided in RFC 3361, this option has a
   single encoding to provide only IPv6 addresses.  Together with RFC
   3361 this option can be used by a mobile SIP client to determine the
   IP version(s) supported in the operator's IMS. RFC 3361 can be used
   to discover the IPv4 address of an IPv4 SIP Proxy Server(s) (with
   enc=1). RFC 3361 (with enc=0) can also be used to discover the Fully
   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of a SIP Proxy Server(s) that, via DNS,
   can be resoved to be IPv4, IPv6, or both.

   Description. The 3GPP2 IPv6 SIP Server Address Option has the
   following format:
