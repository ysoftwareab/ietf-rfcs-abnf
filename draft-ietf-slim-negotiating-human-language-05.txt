         Negotiating Human Language in Real-Time Communications
             draft-ietf-slim-negotiating-human-language-05

Abstract

   Users have various human (natural) language needs, abilities, and
   preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages.  When
   establishing interactive communication ("calls") there needs to be a
   way to negotiate (communicate and match) the caller's language and
   media needs with the capabilities of the called party.  This is
   especially important with emergency calls, where a call can be
   handled by a call taker capable of communicating with the user, or a
   translator or relay operator can be bridged into the call during
   setup, but this applies to non-emergency calls as well (as an
   example, when calling a company call center).

   This document describes the need and a solution using new SDP stream
   attributes.

1.  Introduction

   A mutually comprehensible language is helpful for human
   communication.  This document addresses the real-time, interactive
   side of the issue.  A companion document on language selection in
   email [I-D.ietf-slim-multilangcontent] addresses the non-real-time
   side.

   When setting up interactive communication sessions (using SIP or
   other protocols), human (natural) language and media modality
   (spoken, signed, written) negotiation may be needed.  Unless the
   caller and callee know each other or there is contextual or out of
   band information from which the language(s) and media modalities can
   be determined, there is a need for spoken, signed, or written
   languages to be negotiated based on the caller's needs and the
   callee's capabilities.  This need applies to both emergency and non-
   emergency calls.  For various reasons, including the ability to
   establish multiple streams using different media (e.g., voice, text,
   video), it makes sense to use a per-stream negotiation mechanism, in
   this case, SDP.

   This approach has a number of benefits, including that it is generic
   (applies to all interactive communications negotiated using SDP) and
   not limited to emergency calls.  In some cases such a facility isn't
   needed, because the language is known from the context (such as when
   a caller places a call to a sign language relay center, to a friend,
   or colleague).  But it is clearly useful in many other cases.  For
   example, someone calling a company call center or a Public Safety
   Answering Point (PSAP) should be able to indicate if one or more
   specific signed, written, and/or spoken languages are preferred, the
   callee should be able to indicate its capabilities in this area, and
   the call proceed using in-common language(s) and media forms.

   Since this is a protocol mechanism, the user equipment (UE client)
   needs to know the user's preferred languages; a reasonable technique
   could include a configuration mechanism with a default of the



Gellens                  Expires August 5, 2017                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         Negotiating Human Language          February 2017


   language of the user interface.  In some cases, a UE could tie
   language and media preferences, such as a preference for a video
   stream using a signed language and/or a text or audio stream using a
   written/spoken language.

   Including the user's human (natural) language preferences in the
   session establishment negotiation is independent of the use of a
   relay service and is transparent to a voice service provider.  For
   example, assume a user within the United States who speaks Spanish
   but not English places a voice call.  The call could be an emergency
   call or perhaps to an airline reservation desk.  The language
   information is transparent to the voice service provider, but is part
   of the session negotiation between the UE and the terminating entity.
   In the case of a call to e.g., an airline, the call could be
   automatically handled by a Spanish-speaking agent.  In the case of an
   emergency call, the Emergency Services IP network (ESInet) and the
   PSAP may choose to take the language and media preferences into
   account when determining how to process the call.

   By treating language as another attribute that is negotiated along
   with other aspects of a media stream, it becomes possible to
   accommodate a range of users' needs and called party facilities.  For
   example, some users may be able to speak several languages, but have
   a preference.  Some called parties may support some of those
   languages internally but require the use of a translation service for
   others, or may have a limited number of call takers able to use
   certain languages.  Another example would be a user who is able to
   speak but is deaf or hard-of-hearing and requires a voice stream plus
   a text stream.  Making language a media attribute allows the standard
   session negotiation mechanism to handle this by providing the
   information and mechanism for the endpoints to make appropriate
   decisions.

   Regarding relay services, in the case of an emergency call requiring
   sign language such as ASL, there are currently two common approaches:
   the caller initiates the call to a relay center, or the caller places
   the call to emergency services (e.g., 911 in the U.S. or 112 in
   Europe).  (In a variant of the second case, the voice service
   provider invokes a relay service as well as emergency services.)  In
   the former case, the language need is ancillary and supplemental.  In
   the non-variant second case, the ESInet and/or PSAP may take the need
   for sign language into account and bridge in a relay center.  In this
   case, the ESInet and PSAP have all the standard information available
   (such as location) but are able to bridge the relay sooner in the
   call processing.

   By making this facility part of the end-to-end negotiation, the
   question of which entity provides or engages the relay service



Gellens                  Expires August 5, 2017                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         Negotiating Human Language          February 2017


   becomes separate from the call processing mechanics; if the caller
   directs the call to a relay service then the human language
   negotiation facility provides extra information to the relay service
   but calls will still function without it; if the caller directs the
   call to emergency services, then the ESInet/PSAP are able to take the
   user's human language needs into account, e.g., by assigning to a
   specific queue or call taker or bridging in a relay service or
   translator.

   The term "negotiation" is used here rather than "indication" because
   human language (spoken/written/signed) is something that can be
   negotiated in the same way as which forms of media (audio/text/video)
   or which codecs.  For example, if we think of non-emergency calls,
   such as a user calling an airline reservation center, the user may
   have a set of languages he or she speaks, with perhaps preferences
   for one or a few, while the airline reservation center will support a
   fixed set of languages.  Negotiation should select the user's most
   preferred language that is supported by the call center.  Both sides
   should be aware of which language was negotiated.  This is
   conceptually similar to the way other aspects of each media stream
   are negotiated using SDP (e.g., media type and codecs).

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Desired Semantics

   The desired solution is a media attribute (preferably per direction)
   that may be used within an offer to indicate the preferred language
   of each (direction of a) media stream, and within an answer to
   indicate the accepted language.  The semantics of including multiple
   values for a media stream within an offer is that the languages are
   listed in order of preference.

   (Negotiating multiple simultaneous languages within a media stream is
   out of scope, as the complexity of doing so outweighs the
   usefulness.)

4.  The existing 'lang' attribute

   RFC 4566 [RFC4566] specifies an attribute 'lang' which appears
   similar to what is needed here, but is not sufficiently detailed for
   use here.  In addition, it is not mentioned in [RFC3264] and there
   are no known implementations in SIP.  Further, there is value in

Internet-Draft         Negotiating Human Language          February 2017


   being able to specify language per direction (sending and receiving).
   This document therefore defines two new attributes.

5.  Proposed Solution

   An SDP attribute (per direction) seems the natural choice to
   negotiate human (natural) language of an interactive media stream.
   The attribute value should be a language tag per BCP 47 [RFC5646]

5.1.  Rationale

   The decision to base the proposal at the media negotiation level, and
   specifically to use SDP, came after significant debate and
   discussion.  From an engineering standpoint, it is possible to meet
   the objectives using a variety of mechanisms, but none are perfect.
   None of the proposed alternatives was clearly better technically in
   enough ways to win over proponents of the others, and none were
   clearly so bad technically as to be easily rejected.  As is often the
   case in engineering, choosing the solution is a matter of balancing
   trade-offs, and ultimately more a matter of taste than technical
   merit.  The two main proposals were to use SDP and SIP.  SDP has the
   advantage that the language is negotiated with the media to which it
   applies, while SIP has the issue that the languages expressed may not
   match the SDP media negotiated (for example, a session could
   negotiate video at the SIP level but fail to negotiate any video
   media stream at the SDP layer).

   The mechanism described here for SDP can be adapted to media
   negotiation protocols other than SDP.

5.2.  New 'humintlang-send' and 'humintlang-recv' attributes

   This document defines two new media-level attributes starting with
   'humintlang' (short for "human interactive language") to negotiate
   which human language is used in each interactive media stream.  There
   are two attributes, one ending in "-send" and the other in "-recv",
   registered in Section 6 and described here:

      a=humintlang-send:<language tag>
      a=humintlang-recv:<language tag>

   Each can appear multiple times in an offer for a media stream.

   In an offer, 'humintlang-send' indicates the language(s) the offerer
   is willing to use when sending using the media, and 'humintlang-recv'
   indicates the language(s) the offerer is willing to use when
   receiving using the media.  The values constitute a list of languages
   in preference order (first is most preferred).  When a media is



Gellens                  Expires August 5, 2017                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         Negotiating Human Language          February 2017


   intended for use in one direction only (such as a speech-impaired
   user sending using text and receiving using audio), either
   humintlang-send or humintlang-recv MAY be omitted.  When a media is
   not primarily intended for language (for example, a video or audio
   stream intended for background only) both SHOULD be omitted.
   Otherwise, both SHOULD have the same values in the same order.  The
   two SHOULD NOT be set to languages which are difficult to match
   together (e.g., specifying a desire to send audio in Hungarian and
   receive audio in Portuguese will make it difficult to successfully
   complete the call).

   In an answer, 'humintlang-send' is the accepted language the answerer
   will send (which in most cases is one of the languages in the offer's
   'humintlang-recv'), and 'humintlang-recv' is the accepted language
   the answerer expects to receive (which in most cases is one of the
   languages in the offer's 'humintlang-send').

   Each value MUST be a language tag per BCP 47 [RFC5646].  BCP 47
   describes mechanisms for matching language tags.  Note that [RFC5646]
   Section 4.1 advises to "tag content wisely" and not include
   unnecessary subtags.

   In an offer, each language tag value MAY have an asterisk appended as
   the last character (after the registry value).  The asterisk
   indicates a request by the caller to not fail the call if there is no
   language in common.  See Section 5.3 for more information and
   discussion.

   When placing an emergency call, and in any other case where the
   language cannot be assumed from context, each media stream in an
   offer primarily intended for human language communication SHOULD
   specify both (or in some cases, one of) the 'humintlang-send' and
   'humintlang-recv' attributes.

   Note that while signed language tags are used with a video stream to
   indicate sign language, a spoken language tag for a video stream in
   parallel with an audio stream with the same spoken language tag
   indicates a request for a supplemental video stream to see the
   speaker.

   Clients acting on behalf of end users are expected to set one or both
   'humintlang-send' and 'humintlang-recv' attributes on each media
   stream primarily intended for human communication in an offer when
   placing an outgoing session, and either ignore or take into
   consideration the attributes when receiving incoming calls, based on
   local configuration and capabilities.  Systems acting on behalf of
   call centers and PSAPs are expected to take into account the values
   when processing inbound calls.

Internet-Draft         Negotiating Human Language          February 2017


   Note that media and language negotiation might result in more media
   streams being accepted than are needed by the users (e.g., if more
   preferred and less preferred combinations of media and language are
   all accepted).

5.3.  Advisory vs Required

   One important consideration with this mechanism is if the call fails
   if the callee does not support any of the languages requested by the
   caller.

   In order to provide for maximum likelihood of a successful
   communication session, especially in the case of emergency calling,
   the mechanism defined here provides a way for the caller to indicate
   a preference for the call failing or succeeding when there is no
   language in common.  However, it is OPTIONAL for the callee to honor
   this preference.  For example, a PSAP MAY choose to attempt the call
   even with no language in common, while a corporate call center MAY
   choose to fail the call.

   The mechanism for indicating this preference is that, in an offer, if
   the last character of any of the 'humintlang-recv' or 'humintlang-
   send' values is an asterisk, this indicates a request to not fail the
   call (similar to SIP Accept-Language syntax).  Either way, the called
   party MAY ignore this, e.g., for the emergency services use case, a
   PSAP will likely not fail the call.

5.4.  Silly States

   It is possible to specify a "silly state" where the language
   specified does not make sense for the media type, such as specifying
   a signed language for an audio media stream.

   An offer MUST NOT be created where the language does not make sense
   for the media type.  If such an offer is received, the receiver MAY
   reject the media, ignore the language specified, or attempt to
   interpret the intent (e.g., if American Sign Language is specified
   for an audio media stream, this might be interpreted as a desire to
   use spoken English).

   A spoken language tag for a video stream in conjunction with an audio
   stream with the same language might indicate a request for
   supplemental video to see the speaker.

7.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of BCP 47 [RFC5646] apply here.  In
   addition, if the 'humintlang-send' or 'humintlang-recv' values are
   altered or deleted en route, the session could fail or languages
   incomprehensible to the caller could be selected; however, this is
   also a risk if any SDP parameters are modified en route.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   Language and media information can suggest a user's nationality,
   background, abilities, disabilities, etc.

Appendix A.  Historic Alternative Proposal: Caller-prefs

   The decision to base the proposal at the media negotiation level, and
   specifically to use SDP, came after significant debate and
   discussion.  It is possible to meet the objectives using a variety of
   mechanisms, but none are perfect.  Using SDP means dealing with the
   complexity of SDP, and leaves out real-time session protocols that do
   not use SDP.  The major alternative proposal was to use SIP.  Using
   SIP leaves out non-SIP session protocols, but more fundamentally,
   would occur at a different layer than the media negotiation.  This
   results in a more fragile solution since the media modality and
   language would be negotiated using SIP, and then the specific media
   formats (which inherently include the modality) would be negotiated
   at a different level (typically SDP, especially in the emergency
   calling cases), making it easier to have mismatches (such as where
   the media modality negotiated in SIP don't match what was negotiated
   using SDP).

   An alternative proposal was to use the SIP-level Caller Preferences
   mechanism from RFC 3840 [RFC3840] and RFC 3841 [RFC3841].

   The Caller-prefs mechanism includes a priority system; this would
   allow different combinations of media and languages to be assigned
   different priorities.  The evaluation and decisions on what to do
   with the call can be done either by proxies along the call path, or
   by the addressed UA.  Evaluation of alternatives for routing is
   described in RFC 3841 [RFC3841].

A.1.  Use of Caller Preferences Without Additions

   The following would be possible without adding any new registered
   tags:

   Potential callers and recipients MAY include in the Contact field in
   their SIP registrations media and language tags according to the
   joint capabilities of the UA and the human user according to RFC 3840
   [RFC3840].

   The most relevant media capability tags are "video", "text" and
   "audio".  Each tag represents a capability to use the media in two-
   way communication.

   Language capabilities are declared with a comma-separated list of
   languages that can be used in the call as parameters to the tag
   "language=".

   This is an example of how it is used in a SIP REGISTER:



      REGISTER    user@example.net
      Contact:    <sip:user1@example.net> audio; video; text;
                  language="en,es,ase"

   Including this information in SIP REGISTER allows proxies to act on
   the information.  For the problem set addressed by this document, it
   is not anticipated that proxies will do so using registration data.
   Further, there are classes of devices (such as cellular mobile
   phones) that are not anticipated to include this information in their
   registrations.  Hence, use in registration is OPTIONAL.

   In a call, a list of acceptable media and language combinations is
   declared, and a priority assigned to each combination.

   This is done by the Accept-Contact header field, which defines
   different combinations of media and languages and assigns priorities
   for completing the call with the SIP URI represented by that Contact.
   A priority is assigned to each set as a so-called "q-value" which
   ranges from 1 (most preferred) to 0 (least preferred).

   Using the Accept-Contact header field in INVITE requests and
   responses allows these capabilities to be expressed and used during
   call set-up.  Clients SHOULD include this information in INVITE
   requests and responses.

   Example:



Gellens                  Expires August 5, 2017                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft         Negotiating Human Language          February 2017


      Accept-Contact:    *; text; language="en"; q=0.2
      Accept-Contact:    *; video; language="ase"; q=0.8

   This example shows the highest preference expressed by the caller is
   to use video with American Sign Language (language code "ase").  As a
   fallback, it is acceptable to get the call connected with only
   English text used for human communication.  Other media may of course
   be connected as well, without expectation that it will be usable by
   the caller for interactive communications (but may still be helpful
   to the caller).

   This system satisfies all the needs described in the previous
   chapters, except that language specifications do not make any
   distinction between spoken and written language, and that the need
   for directionality in the specification cannot be fulfilled.

   To some degree the lack of media specification between speech and
   text in language tags can be compensated by only specifying the
   important medium in the Accept-Contact field.

   Thus, a user who wants to use English mainly for text would specify:



      Accept-Contact:    *;text;language="en";q=1.0

   While a user who wants to use English mainly for speech but accept it
   for text would specify:



      Accept-Contact:    *;audio;language="en";q=0.8
      Accept-Contact:    *;text;language="en";q=0.2

   However, a user who would like to talk, but receive text back has no
   way to do it with the existing specification.

A.2.  Additional Caller Preferences for Asymmetric Needs

   In order to be able to specify asymmetric preferences, there are two
   possibilities.  Either new language tags in the style of the
   humintlang parameters described above for SDP could be registered, or
   additional media tags describing the asymmetry could be registered.

Internet-Draft         Negotiating Human Language          February 2017


A.2.1.  Caller Preferences for Asymmetric Modality Needs

   The following new media tags should be defined:

      speech-receive
      speech-send
      text-receive
      text-send
      sign-send
      sign-receive

   A user who prefers to talk and get text in return in English would
   register the following (if including this information in registration
   data):



      REGISTER    user@example.net
      Contact:    <sip:user1@example.net> audio;text;speech-send;text-
                  receive;language="en"

   At call time, a user who prefers to talk and get text in return in
   English would set the Accept-Contact header field to:



      Accept-Contact:    *; audio; text; speech-receive; text-send;
                         language="en";q=0.8
      Accept-Contact:    *; text; language="en"; q=0.2

   Note that the directions specified here are as viewed from the callee
   side to match what the callee has registered.

   A bridge arranged for invoking a relay service specifically arranged
   for captioned telephony would register the following for supporting
   calling users:



      REGISTER    ct@ctrelay.net
      Contact:    <sip:ct1@ctreley.net> audio; text; speech-receive;
                  text-send; language="en"

   A bridge arranged for invoking a relay service specifically arranged
   for captioned telephony would register the following for supporting
   called users:

Internet-Draft         Negotiating Human Language          February 2017


      REGISTER    ct@ctrelay.net
      Contact:    <sip:ct2@ctreley.net> audio; text; speech-send; text-
                  receive; language="en"

   At call time, these alternatives are included in the list of possible
   outcome of the call routing by the SIP proxies and the proper relay
   service is invoked.

A.2.2.  Caller Preferences for Asymmetric Language Tags

   An alternative is to register new language tags for the purpose of
   asymmetric language usage.

   Instead of using "language=", six new language tags would be
   registered:

      humintlang-text-recv
      humintlang-text-send
      humintlang-speech-recv
      humintlang-speech-send
      humintlang-sign-recv
      humintlang-sign-send

   These language tags would be used instead of the regular
   bidirectional language tags, and users with bidirectional
   capabilities SHOULD specify values for both directions.  Services
   specifically arranged for supporting users with asymmetric needs
   SHOULD specify only the asymmetry they support.
