1.  Introduction

   Most web transactions are short transfers that are significantly
   delayed by the TLS connection establishment.  To accelerate the
   connection establishment, TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and its predecessors
   provide session resumption mechanisms.  They abbreviate the TLS
   handshake based on a shared secret exchanged during a prior TLS
   session between client and server.  In total, these resumption
   handshakes significantly reduce computational overhead for
   cryptographic operations and save up to one round-trip compared to
   the full TLS connection establishment.

   TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] allows resumption handshakes across Server Name
   Indications (SNIs) when they share the same TLS certificate.
   However, TLS 1.3 recommends not to use TLS resumptions across SNIs to
   avoid loosing a single-use ticket in case of a failed resumption
   attempt.  This practice requires costly full TLS connection
   establishments in situations where a performance-optimized resumption
   handshake across SNI values would be possible.  To illustrate this
   performance limitation, we describe the common situation of a
   redirected web request.  We assume that the hostname example.com
   redirects to www.example.com and both hostnames are operated by the
   same entity and use the same certificate for their authentication.  A
   client requesting www.example.com via this redirect requires two full
   TLS handshakes following the recommendation of TLS 1.3 [RFC8446].
   Using resumption across SNI values, the later full handshake can be
   converted to a performance-optimized resumed handshake.  A
   comprehensive study of the performance benefits of resumptions across
   SNI values for popular websites can be found in [PERF].

Internet-Draft          TLS 1.3 Resumption Group              March 2019


   This document defines a mechanism to inform the client in between
   which SNI values TLS resumptions are supported.  This information
   enables the client to use resumption across SNI values only in
   situations where the chance of a successful resumption handshake is
   high.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Overview on Resumptions across SNI values

   When a client wants to form a TLS connection to a server, it
   indicates support for the "resumption_group" extension in the
   ClientHello message.  To signal its support for this extension type,
   the server returns the "resumption_group" extension with an empty
   data field.

   The client is now aware, that all SNI values for which the presented
   server certificate is valid, form a TLS resumption group.  Thus,
   resumption tickets issued by a group member are designated to be used
   to establish resumed connections to any member of the same group.

4.  The "resumption_group" Extension

   This extension carries no data as defined in the following
   ResumptionGroup structure:

      struct {
      } ResumptionGroup;

4.1.  Client Behavior

   To indicate support for the "resumption_group" extension, the client
   sends this extension type within the initial ClientHello message to
   the server.

   Upon receiving the server's response, the client checks whether the
   "resumption_group" extension is present in the extension list of the
   server's CertificateEntry (see Section 4.2.2 of [RFC6066]).

   If this extension type is not included in the response of the server,
   then the client reasons that the server is not configured to support

   the "resumption_group" extension and proceeds with a normal
   handshake.

   Otherwise, the client proceeds with a normal connection establishment
   and associates all retrieved resumption tickets to the corresponding
   resumption group.  This resumption group is formed of all SNI values
   that are valid for the presented server certificate.

   To establish a resumed connection to any SNI value included in a
   resumption group, the client uses a resumption ticket associated to
   the same group.  The Client Hello of a resumed handshake MUST NOT
   include the "resumption_group" extension.

   Tickets received during a resumed connection MUST be associated to
   the same resumption group of the ticket that was used during the
   establishment of this connection.

   If a SNI value is a member of multiple resumption groups, then the
   client is recommended to use the freshest valid ticket for a
   resumption handshake.  It is assumed, that fresher resumption tickets
   are more likely to be accepted by the respective server.

   According to [RFC8446], clients MUST NOT cache tickets longer than
   seven days.

   Note, that TLS resumption enables a server to link resumed
   connections to the same client.  A study on the feasibility of this
   tracking mechanism can be found in [TRAC].  To protect the client's
   privacy against tracking via this mechanism, it is RECOMMENDED to
   cache resumption tickets only for ten minutes.

4.2.  Server Behavior

   Upon receiving an initial Client Hello message, the server validates
   if the client provided an extension of the type "resumption_group".

   If the "resumption_group" extension is not listed by the client, then
   the server's response MUST NOT include an entry for this extension
   type.  Otherwise, the server includes the "resumption_group"
   extension in the extension list of the server's CertificateEntry, to
   signal support for resumptions across SNI values.  Subsequently, the
   server proceeds with a normal handshake.

   This extension type does not affect the server behavior for resumed
   connection establishments.

5.  Expectations on Certificates

   This "resumption_group" extension forms the resumption group based on
   the SNI values that are valid for the server's certificate.  To
   optimize the performance benefit of this extension, the server's
   certificate is RECOMMENDED to only include SNI values that mutually
   support the resumption of their TLS connections.  Otherwise, the
   client's resumption attempt across SNI values will fail if the server
   does not support this practice.  Note, that each failed resumption
   handshake uses up a single-use resumption ticket.  As a result, these
   failed attempts might use up all cached single-use tickets, which
   hinders the client to establish performance-optimized resumption
   handshakes to legitimate SNI values.

6.  Compatibility Issues with Middleboxes

   [RFC8446]; Section 9.3 requires MITM proxies to remove any extensions
   they do not understand.  If a conformant MITM proxy does not support
   this extension, it will remove this extension type from the Client
   Hello.  As a result, the server reacts as if it is not supporting
   this extension type.

7.  Security Considerations

   Clients MUST only resume to a new SNI value if this SNI value is
   valid for the server certificate presented in the original
   connection.  To facilitate a correct implementation of this
   requirement, the resumption group is identical to the list of SNI
   values valid for a specific server certificate.  Note, that the
   security of TLS resumptions across different SNI values is also
   discussed in Section 4.6.1 of [RFC8446].

8.  IANA Considerations

   TODO IANA needs to be requested to create an entry, resumption_group,
   in the existing registry for ExtensionType (defined in [RFC8446]),
   with "TLS 1.3" column values being set to "CH, EE", and "Recommended"
   column being set to "Yes".
