1.  Introduction

   Matroska aims to become THE standard of multimedia container formats.
   It was derived from a project called MCF [1], but differentiates from
   it significantly because it is based on EBML [2] (Extensible Binary
   Meta Language), a binary derivative of XML.  EBML enables significant
   advantages in terms of future format extensibility, without breaking
   file support in old parsers.

   First, it is essential to clarify exactly "What an Audio/Video
   container is", to avoid any misunderstandings:

   o  It is NOT a video or audio compression format (video codec)

   o  It is an envelope for which there can be many audio, video and
      subtitles streams, allowing the user to store a complete movie or
      CD in a single file.

   Matroska is designed with the future in mind.  It incorporates
   features like:

   o  Fast seeking in the file

   o  Chapter entries

   o  Full metadata (tags) support

   o  Selectable subtitle/audio/video streams

   o  Modularly expandable

   o  Error resilience (can recover playback even when the stream is
      damaged)

   o  Streamable over the internet and local networks (HTTP, CIFS, FTP,
      etc)

   o  Menus (like DVDs have)

   Matroska is an open standards project.  This means for personal use
   it is absolutely free to use and that the technical specifications
   describing the bitstream are open to everybody, even to companies
   that would like to support it in their products.

2.  Status of this document

   This document is a work-in-progress specification defining the
   Matroska file format as part of the IETF Cellar working group [3].
   But since it's quite complete it is used as a reference for the
   development of libmatroska.  Legacy versions of the specification can
   be found here [4] (PDF doc by Alexander Noe -- outdated).

   For a simplified diagram of the layout of a Matroska file, see the
   Diagram page [5].

   A more refined and detailed version of the EBML specifications is
   being worked on here [6].

   The table found below is now generated from the "source" of the
   Matroska specification.  This XML file [7] is also used to generate
   the semantic data used in libmatroska and libmatroska2.  We encourage
   anyone to use and monitor its changes so your code is spec-proof and
   always up to date.

   Note that versions 1, 2 and 3 have been finalized.  Version 4 is
   currently work in progress.  There MAY be further additions to v4.

3.  Security Considerations

   Matroska inherits security considerations from EBML.  Other security
   considerations are to be determined.

4.  IANA Considerations

   To be determined.

5.  Notations and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [8].

6.  Basis in EBML

   Matroska is a Document Type of EBML (Extensible Binary Meta
   Language).  This specification is dependent on the EBML Specification
   [9].  For an understanding of Matroska's EBML Schema, see in
   particular the sections of the EBML Specification covering EBML
   Element Types [10], EBML Schema [11], and EBML Structure [12].

6.1.  Added Constaints on EBML

   As an EBML Document Type, Matroska adds the following constraints to
   the EBML specification.

   o  The "docType" of the "EBML Header" MUST be 'matroska'.

   o  The "EBMLMaxIDLength" of the "EBML Header" MUST be "4".

   o  The "EBMLMaxSizeLength" of the "EBML Header" MUST be "8" or less.

6.2.  Matroska Design

   All top-levels elements (Segment and direct sub-elements) are coded
   on 4 octets, i.e. class D elements.

6.2.1.  Language Codes

   Language codes can be either the 3 letters bibliographic ISO-639-2
   [13] form (like "fre" for french), or such a language code followed
   by a dash and a country code for specialities in languages (like
   "fre-ca" for Canadian French).  Country codes are the same as used
   for internet domains [14].

6.2.2.  Physical Types

   Each level can have different meanings for audio and video.  The
   ORIGINAL_MEDIUM tag can be used to specify a string for
   ChapterPhysicalEquiv = 60.  Here is the list of possible levels for
   both audio and video :

6.2.3.  Block Structure

   Size = 1 + (1-8) + 4 + (4 + (4)) octets.  So from 6 to 21 octets.

   Bit 0 is the most significant bit.

   Frames using references SHOULD be stored in "coding order".  That
   means the references first and then the frames referencing them.  A
   consequence is that timecodes MAY NOT be consecutive.  But a frame
   with a past timecode MUST reference a frame already known, otherwise
   it's considered bad/void.

   There can be many Blocks in a BlockGroup provided they all have the
   same timecode.  It is used with different parts of a frame with
   different priorities.

   | Block Header | | Offset | Player | Description | | 0x00+ | MUST |
   Track Number (Track Entry).  It is coded in EBML like form (1 octet
   if the value is < 0x80, 2 if < 0x4000, etc) (most significant bits

   each frame of the lace, except for the last one (multiple uint8).
   *This is not used with Fixed-size lacing as it is calculated
   automatically from (total size of lace) / (number of frames in
   lace). | | (possibly) Laced Data | | 0x00 | MUST | Consecutive laced
   frames |

6.2.4.  Lacing

   Lacing is a mechanism to save space when storing data.  It is
   typically used for small blocks of data (refered to as frames in
   matroska).  There are 3 types of lacing : the Xiph one inspired by
   what is found in the Ogg container, the EBML one which is the same
   with sizes coded differently and the fixed-size one where the size is
   not coded.  As an example is better than words...

   Let's say you want to store 3 frames of the same track.  The first
   frame is 800 octets long, the second is 500 octets long and the third
   is 1000 octets long.  As these data are small, you can store them in
   a lace to save space.  They will then be solved in the same block as
   follows:

6.2.4.1.  Xiph lacing

   o  Block head (with lacing bits set to 01)

   o  Lacing head: Number of frames in the lace -1, i.e. 2 (the 800 and
      500 octets one)

Internet-Draft                  Matroska                       July 2016


   o  Lacing sizes: only the 2 first ones will be coded, 800 gives
      255;255;255;35, 500 gives 255;245.  The size of the last frame is
      deduced from the total size of the Block.

   o  Data in frame 1

   o  Data in frame 2

   o  Data in frame 3

   A frame with a size multiple of 255 is coded with a 0 at the end of
   the size, for example 765 is coded 255;255;255;0.

6.2.4.2.  EBML lacing

   In this case the size is not coded as blocks of 255 bytes, but as a
   difference with the previous size and this size is coded as in EBML.
   The first size in the lace is unsigned as in EBML.  The others use a
   range shifting to get a sign on each value :

   o  Block head (with lacing bits set to 11)

   o  Lacing head: Number of frames in the lace -1, i.e. 2 (the 800 and
      400 octets one)

   o  Lacing sizes: only the 2 first ones will be coded, 800 gives 0x320
      0x4000 = 0x4320, 500 is coded as -300 : - 0x12C + 0x1FFF + 0x4000
      = 0x5ED3.  The size of the last frame is deduced from the total
      size of the Block.

   o  Data in frame 1

   o  Data in frame 2

   o  Data in frame 3

6.2.4.3.  Fixed-size lacing

   In this case only the number of frames in the lace is saved, the size
   of each frame is deduced from the total size of the Block.  For
   example, for 3 frames of 800 octets each :

   o  Block head (with lacing bits set to 10)

   o  Lacing head: Number of frames in the lace -1, i.e. 2

   o  Data in frame 1

   o  Data in frame 2

   o  Data in frame 3

6.2.4.4.  SimpleBlock Structure

   The SimpleBlock is very inspired by the [Block
   structure](({{site.baseurl}}/index.html#block-structure).  The main
   differences are the added Keyframe flag and Discardable flag.
   Otherwise everything is the same.

   Size = 1 + (1-8) + 4 + (4 + (4)) octets.  So from 6 to 21 octets.

   Bit 0 is the most significant bit.

   Frames using references SHOULD be stored in "coding order".  That
   means the references first and then the frames referencing them.  A
   consequence is that timecodes MAY NOT be consecutive.  But a frame
   with a past timecode MUST reference a frame already known, otherwise
   it's considered bad/void.

   There can be many Blocks in a BlockGroup provided they all have the
   same timecode.  It is used with different parts of a frame with
   different priorities.

   | SimpleBlock Header | | Offset | Player | Description | | 0x00+ |
   MUST | Track Number (Track Entry).  It is coded in EBML like form (1
   octet if the value is < 0x80, 2 if < 0x4000, etc) (most significant
   bits set to increase the range). | | 0x01+ | MUST | Timecode

   lace). | | (possibly) Laced Data | | 0x00 | MUST | Consecutive laced
   frames |

6.2.4.5.  EncryptedBlock Structure

   The EncryptedBlock is very inspired by the [SimpleBlock
   structure](({{site.baseurl}}/index.html#simpleblock_structure).  The
   main differences is that the raw data are Transformed.  That means
   the data after the lacing definition (if present) have been processed
   before put into the Block.  The laced sizes apply on the decoded
   (Inverse Transform) data.  This size of the Transformed data MAY NOT
   match the size of the initial chunk of data.

   The other difference is that the number of frames in the lace are not
   saved if "no lacing" is specified (bits 5 and 6 set to 0).

   The Transformation is specified by a TransformID in the Block (MUST
   be the same for all frames within the EncryptedBlock).

   Size = 1 + (1-8) + 4 + (4 + (4)) octets.  So from 6 to 21 octets.

   Bit 0 is the most significant bit.

   Frames using references SHOULD be stored in "coding order".  That
   means the references first and then the frames referencing them.  A
   consequence is that timecodes MAY NOT be consecutive.  But a frame
   with a past timecode MUST reference a frame already known, otherwise
   it's considered bad/void.

   There can be many Blocks in a BlockGroup provided they all have the
   same timecode.  It is used with different parts of a frame with
   different priorities.

   octet if the value is < 0x80, 2 if < 0x4000, etc) (most significant

   TransformID (EBML coded integer value).  Value 0 = Null Transform | |
   0x01+ | MUST | Consecutive laced frames |

6.2.4.6.  Virtual Block

   The data in matroska is stored in coding order.  But that means if
   you seek to a particular point and a frame has been referenced far
   away, you won't know while playing and you might miss this frame
   (true for independent frames and overlapping of dependent frames).
   So the idea is to have a placeholder for the original frame in the
   timecode (display) order.

   The structure is a scaled down version of the normal Block [15].

   | Virtual Block Header | | Offset | Player | Description | | 0x00+ |
   MUST | Track Number (Track Entry).  It is coded in EBML like form (1
   octet if the value is < 0x80, 2 if < 0x4000, etc) (most significant
   bits set to increase the range). | | 0x01+ | MUST | Timecode

7.  Matroska Schema

   This specification includes an "EBML Schema" which defines the
   Elements and structure of Matroska as an EBML Document Type.  The

   EBML Schema defines every valid Matroska element in a manner defined
   by the EBML specification.

   For convenience the section of the EBML specification that defines
   EBML Schema Element Attributes is restated here:

7.1.  EBML Schema Element Attributes

   Within an EBML Schema the "<EBMLSchema>" uses the following
   attributes to define the EBML Schema:

   +-----------+----------+--------------------------------------------+
   | attribute | required | definition                                 |
   | name      |          |                                            |
   +-----------+----------+--------------------------------------------+
   | docType   | Yes      | The "docType" lists the official name of   |
   |           |          | the EBML Document Type that is defined by  |
   |           |          | the EBML Schema; for example, "<EBMLSchema |
   |           |          | docType="matroska">".                      |
   | version   | Yes      | The "version" lists an incremental non-    |
   |           |          | negative integer that specifies the        |
   |           |          | version of the docType documented by the   |
   |           |          | EBML Schema. Unlike XML Schemas, an EBML   |
   |           |          | Schema documents all versions of a         |
   |           |          | docType's definition rather than using     |
   |           |          | separate EBML Schemas for each version of  |
   |           |          | a docType. Elements may be introduced and  |
   |           |          | deprecated by using the "minver" and       |
   |           |          | "maxver" attributes of .                   |
   +-----------+----------+--------------------------------------------+

   Within an EBML Schema the "<element>" uses the following attributes
   to define an EBML Element.

   +--------------------+----------+-----------------------------------+
   | attribute name     | required | definition                        |
   +--------------------+----------+-----------------------------------+
   | name               | Yes      | The official human-readable name  |
   |                    |          | of the EBML Element. The value of |
   |                    |          | the name MUST be in the form of   |
   |                    |          | an NCName as defined by the XML   |
   |                    |          | Schema specification [16].        |
   | level              | Yes      | The level notes at what           |
   |                    |          | hierarchical depth the EBML       |
   |                    |          | Element may occur within an EBML  |
   |                    |          | Document. The Root Element of an  |
   |                    |          | EBML Document is at level 0 and   |
   |                    |          | the Elements that it may contain  |

   | Documentation |        The duration of the Block (based on        |
   |               |   TimecodeScale). This Element is mandatory when  |
   |               |  DefaultDuration is set for the track (but can be |
   |               |     omitted as other default values). When not    |

   |               | next Block in "display" order (not coding order). |
   |               |  This Element can be useful at the end of a Track |
   |               |  (as there is not other Block available), or when |
   |               |   there is a break in a track like for subtitle   |
   |               | tracks. When set to 0 that means the frame is not |

   If you intend to implement a Matroska player, make sure you can
   handle all the files in our test suite [20], or at least the features
   presented there, not necessarily the same codecs.

240.  Beginning of File

   An EBML file always starts with 0x1A.  The 0x1A makes the DOS command
   "type" ends display.  That way you can include ASCII text before the
   EBML data and it can be displayed.  The EBML parser is safe from
   false-alarm with these ASCII only codes.

   Next the EBML header is stored.  This allows the the parser to know
   what type of EBML file it is parsing.

241.  Block Timecodes

   The Block's timecode is signed interger that represents the Raw
   Timecode relative to the Cluster's [21] Timecode [22], multiplied by
   the TimecodeScale (see the TimecodeScale notes [23]).

   The Block's timecode is represented by a 16bit signed interger
   (sint16).  This means that the Block's timecode has a range of -32768
   to +32767 units.  When using the default value of TimecodeScale, each

Internet-Draft                  Matroska                       July 2016


   integer represents 1ms.  So, the maximum time span of Blocks in a
   Cluster using the default TimecodeScale of 1ms is 65536ms.

   If a Cluster's [24] Timecode [25] is set to zero, it is possible to
   have Blocks with a negative Raw Timecode.  Blocks with a negative Raw
   Timecode are not valid.

242.  Default decoded field duration

   The "DefaultDecodedFieldDuration" Element can signal to the
   displaying application how often fields of a video sequence will be
   available for displaying.  It can be used for both interlaced and
   progressive content.

   If the video sequence is signaled as interlaced, then the period
   between two successive fields at the output of the decoding process
   equals DefaultDecodedFieldDuration.

   For video sequences signaled as progressive it is twice the value of
   DefaultDecodedFieldDuration.

   These values are valid at the end of the decoding process before
   post-processing like deinterlacing or inverse telecine is applied.

   Examples:

   o  Blu-ray movie: 1000000000ns/(48/1.001) = 20854167ns

   o  PAL broadcast/DVD: 1000000000ns/(50/1.000) = 20000000ns

   o  N/ATSC broadcast: 1000000000ns/(60/1.001) = 16683333ns

   o  hard-telecined DVD: 1000000000ns/(60/1.001) = 16683333ns (60
      encoded interlaced fields per second)

   o  soft-telecined DVD: 1000000000ns/(60/1.001) = 16683333ns (48
      encoded interlaced fields per second, with "repeat_first_field =
      1")

243.  Default Values

   The default value of an Element is assumed when not present in the
   data stream.  It is assumed only in the scope of its Parent Element
   (for example "Language" in the scope of the "Track" element).  If the
   "Parent Element" is not present or assumed, then the Element cannot
   be assumed.

244.  DRM

   Digital Rights Management.  See Encryption [26].

245.  EBML Class

   A larger EBML Class typically means the Element has a lower
   probability/importance.  A larger Class-ID can be used as a synch
   word in case the file is damaged.  Elements that are used frequently,
   but do not need to act as a synch word, SHOULD have a small Class-ID.
   For example, the Cluster has a 4 octet ID and can be used as a synch
   word if the file is damaged.  However, the every common Element in
   the BlockGroup has a single octet ID to conserve space because of how
   frequently it is used.

246.  Encryption

   Encryption in Matroska is designed in a very generic style that
   allows people to implement whatever form of encryption is best for
   them.  It is easily possible to use the encryption framework in
   Matroska as a type of DRM.

   Because the encryption occurs within the Block, it is possible to
   manipulate encrypted streams without decrypting them.  The streams
   could potentially be copied, deleted, cut, appended, or any number of
   other possible editing techniques without ever decrypting them.  This
   means that the data is more useful, without having to expose it, or
   go through the intensive process of decrypting.

   Encryption can also be layered within Matroska.  This means that two
   completely different types of encryption can be used, requiring two
   seperate keys to be able to decrypt a stream.

   Encryption information is stored in the "ContentEncodings" Master-
   element under the "ContentEncryption" Element.

247.  Image cropping

   Thanks to the PixelCropXXX elements, it's possible to crop the image
   before being resized.  That means the image size follows this path:

   PixelXXX (size of the coded image) -> PixelCropXXX (size of the image
   to keep) -> DisplayXXX (resized cropped image)

248.  Matroska version indicators

   The EBML Header each Matroska file starts with contains two version
   number fields that inform a reading application about what to expect.
   These are "DocTypeVersion" and "DocTypeReadVersion".

   "DocTypeVersion" MUST contain the highest Matroska version number of
   any Element present in the Matroska file.  For example, a file using
   the SimpleBlock Element MUST have a "DocTypeVersion" of at least 2
   while a file containing "CueRelativePosition" Elements MUST have a
   "DocTypeVersion" of at least 4.

   The "DocTypeReadVersion" MUST contain the minimum version number a
   reading application MUST at least suppost properly in order to play
   the file back (optionally with a reduced feature set).  For example,
   if a file contains only Elements of version 2 or lower except for
   "CueRelativePosition" (which is a version 4 Matroska Element) then
   "DocTypeReadVersion" SHOULD still be set to 2 and not 4 because
   evaluating "CueRelativePosition" is not REQUIRED for standard
   playback -- it only makes seeking more precise if used.

   "DocTypeVersion" MUST always be equal to or greater than
   "DocTypeReadVersion".

   A reading application supporting Matroska version "V" MUST NOT refuse
   to read an application with "DocReadTypeVersion" equal to or lower
   than "V" even if "DocTypeVersion" is greater than "V".  See also the
   note about Unknown Elements [27].

249.  Mime Types

   There is no IETF endorsed MIME type for Matroska files.  But you can
   use the ones we have defined on our web server:

   o  .mka : Matroska audio "audio/x-matroska"

   o  .mkv : Matroska video "video/x-matroska"

   o  .mk3d : Matroska 3D video "video/x-matroska-3d"

250.  Octet

   An Octet refers to a byte made of 8 bits.

251.  Overlay Track

   Overlay tracks SHOULD be rendered in the same 'channel' as the track
   it's linked to.  When content is found in such a track it is played
   on the rendering channel instead of the original track.

252.  Position References

   The position in some Elements refers to the position, in octets, from
   the beginning of an Element.  The reference is the beginning of the
   first Segment (= its position + the size of its ID and size fields).
   0 = first possible position of a level 1 Element in the Segment.
   When data is spanned over mutiple Segments within a Section 254 (in
   the same file or in different files), the position represents the
   accumulated offset of each Segment.  For example to reference a
   position in the third Segment, the position will be: the first
   segment total size + second segment total size + offset of the
   Element in the third segment.

253.  Raw Timecode

   The exact time of an object represented in nanoseconds.  To find out
   a Block's Raw Timecode, you need the Block's timecode, the Cluster's
   [28] Timecode [29], and the TimecodeScale.  For calculation, please
   see the see the TimecodeScale notes.

254.  Linked Segments

   Matroska provides several methods to link two or many Segments
   together to create a Linked Segment.  A Linked Segment is a set of
   multiple Segments related together into a single presentation by
   using Hard Linking, Soft Linking, or Medium Linking.  All Segments
   within a Linked Segment MUST utilize the same track numbers and
   timescale.  All Segments within a Linked Segment MUST be stored
   within the same directory.  All Segments within a Linked Segment MUST
   store a "SegmentUID".

254.1.  Hard Linking

   Hard Linking (also called splitting) is the process of creating a
   Linked Segment by relating multiple Segments using the "PrevUID" and
   "NextUID" Elements.  Within a Linked Segment the timestamps of each
   Segment MUST follow consecutively in linking order.  With Hard
   Linking, the chapters of any Segment within the Linked Segment MUST
   only reference the current Segment.  With Hard Linking, the "NextUID"
   and "PrevUID" MUST reference the respective "SegmentUID" values of
   the next and previous Segments.  The first Segment of a Linked
   Segment MUST have a "NextUID" Element and MUST NOT have a "PrevUID"

   Element.  The last Segment of a Linked Segment MUST have a "PrevUID"
   Element and MUST NOT have a "NextUID" Element.  The middle Segments
   of a Linked Segment MUST have both a "NextUID" Element and a
   "PrevUID" Element.

   As an example four Segments MAY be Hard Linked as a Linked Segment
   through cross-referencing each other with "SegmentUID", "PrevUID",
   and "NextUID" as in this table.

   +--------+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+

254.2.  Soft Linking

   Soft Linking is used by codec chapters.  They can reference another
   Segment and jump to that Segment.  The way the Segments are described
   are internal to the chapter codec and unknown to the Matroska level.
   But there are Elements within the "Info" Element (such as
   "ChapterTranslate") that can translate a value representing a Segment
   in the chapter codec and to the current "SegmentUID".  All Segments
   that could be used in a Linked Segment in this way SHOULD be marked
   as members of the same family via the SegmentFamily Element, so that
   the player can quickly switch from one to the other.

254.3.  Medium Linking

   WMedium Linking creates relationships between Segments using Ordered
   Chapters and the "ChapterSegmentUID" Element.  A Segment Edition with
   Ordered Chapters MAY contain Chapters that reference timestamp ranges
   from other Segments.  The Segment referenced by the Ordered Chapter
   via the "ChapterSegmentUID" Element SHOULD be played as part of a
   Linked Segment.  The timestamps of Segment content referenced by
   Ordered Chapters MUST be adjusted according to the cumulative
   duration of the the previous Ordered Chapters.

   As an example a file named "intro.mkv" could have a "SegmentUID" of
   "0xb16a58609fc7e60653a60c984fc11ead".  Another file called
   "program.mkv" could use a Chapter Edition that contains two Ordered
   Chapters.  The first chapter references the Segment of "intro.mkv"
   with the use of a "ChapterSegmentUID", "ChapterSegmentEditionUID",
   "ChapterTimeStart" and optionally a "ChapterTimeEnd" element.  The
   second chapter references content within the Segment of
   "program.mkv".  A player SHOULD recognize the Linked Segment created
   by the use of "ChapterSegmentUID" in an enabled Edition and present
   the reference content of the two Segments together.

255.  Timecode Types

   o  Absolute Timecode = Block+Cluster

   o  Relative Timecode = Block

   o  Scaled Timecode = Block+Cluster

   o  Raw Timecode = (Block+Cluster)_TimecodeScale_TrackTimecodeScale

256.  TimecodeScale

   The TimecodeScale [30] is used to calculate the Raw Timecode of a
   Block.  The timecode is obtained by adding the Block's timecode to
   the Cluster's [31] Timecode [32], and then multiplying that result by
   the TimecodeScale.  The result will be the Block's Raw Timecode in
   nanoseconds.  The formula for this would look like:

     (a + b) * c

     a = [Block's Timecode]({{site.baseurl}}/index.html#block-header)
     b = [Cluster's](#cluster) [Timecode](#timecode)
     c = [TimeCodeScale]({{site.baseurl}}/index.html#TimeCodeScale)

   An example of this is, assume a Cluster's [33] Timecode [34] has a
   value of 564264, the Block has a Timecode of 1233, and the
   timecodescale is the default of 1000000.

                 (1233 + 564264) * 1000000 = 565497000000

   So, the Block in this example has a specific time of 565497000000 in
   nanoseconds.  In milliseconds this would be 565497ms.

257.  TimecodeScale Rounding

   Because the default value of TimecodeScale is 1000000, which makes
   each integer in the Cluster and Block timecodes equal 1ms, this is
   the most commonly used.  When dealing with audio, this causes
   innaccuracy with where you are seeking to.  When the audio is
   combined with video, this is not an issue.  For most cases the the
   synch of audio to video does not need to be more than 1ms accurate.
   This becomes obvious when one considers that sound will take 2-3ms to
   travel a single meter, so distance from your speakers will have a
   greater effect on audio/visual synch than this.

   However, when dealing with audio only files, seeking accuracy can
   become critical.  For instance, when storing a whole CD in a single
   track, you want to be able to seek to the exact sample that a song
   begins at.  If you seek a few sample ahead or behind then a 'crack'
   or 'pop' may result as a few odd samples are rendered.  Also, when
   performing precise editing, it may be very useful to have the audio
   accuracy down to a single sample.

   It is usually true that when storing timecodes for an audio stream,
   the TimecodeScale MUST have an accuracy of at least that of the audio
   samplerate, otherwise there are rounding errors that prevent you from
   knowing the precise location of a sample.  Here's how a program has
   to round each timecode in order to be able to recreate the sample
   number accurately.

   Let's assume that the application has an audio track with a sample
   rate of 44100.  As written above the TimecodeScale MUST have at least
   the accuracy of the sample rate itself: 1000000000 / 44100 =
   22675.7369614512.  This value MUST always be truncated.  Otherwise
   the accuracy will not suffice.  So in this example the application
   wil use 22675 for the TimecodeScale.  The application could even use
   some lower value like 22674 which would allow it to be a little bit
   imprecise about the original timecodes.  But more about that in a
   minute.

   Next the application wants to write sample number 52340 and
   calculates the timecode.  This is easy.  In order to calculate the
   Raw Timecode in ns all it has to do is calculate "RawTimecode =
   round(1000000000 * sample_number / sample_rate)".  Rounding at this
   stage is very important!  The application might skip it if it choses
   a slightly smaller value for the TimecodeScale factor instead of the
   truncated one like shown above.  Otherwise it has to round or the
   results won't be reversible.  For our example we get "RawTimecode =
   round(1000000000 * 52340 / 44100) = round(1186848072.56236) =
   1186848073".

Internet-Draft                  Matroska                       July 2016


   The next step is to calculate the Absolute Timecode - that is the
   timecode that will be stored in the Matroska file.  Here the
   application has to divide the Raw Timecode from the previous
   paragraph by the TimecodeScale factor and round the result:
   "AbsoluteTimecode = round(RawTimecode / TimecodeScale_facotr)" which
   will result in the following for our example: "AbsoluteTimecode =
   round(1186848073 / 22675) = round(52341.7011245866) = 52342".  This
   number is the one the application has to write to the file.

   Now our file is complete, and we want to play it back with another
   application.  Its task is to find out which sample the first
   application wrote into the file.  So it starts reading the Matroska
   file and finds the TimecodeScale factor 22675 and the audio sample
   rate 44100.  Later it finds a data block with the Absolute Timecode
   of 52342.  But how does it get the sample number from these numbers?

   First it has to calculate the Raw Timecode of the block it has just
   read.  Here's no rounding involved, just an integer multiplication:
   "RawTimecode = AbsoluteTimecode * TimecodeScale_factor".  In our
   example: "RawTimecode = 52342 * 22675 = 1186854850".

   The conversion from the RawTimecode to the sample number again
   requires rounding: "sample_number = round(RawTimecode * sample_rate /
   1000000000)".  In our example: "sample_number = round(1186854850 *
   44100 / 1000000000) = round(52340.298885) = 52340".  This is exactly
   the sample number that the previous program started with.

   Some general notes for a program:

   1.  Always calculate the timestamps / sample numbers with floating
       point numbers of at least 64bit precision (called 'double' in
       most modern programming languages).  If you're calculating with
       integers then make sure they're 64bit long, too.

   2.  Always round if you divide.  Always!  If you don't you'll end up
       with situations in which you have a timecode in the Matroska file
       that does not correspond to the sample number that it started
       with.  Using a slightly lower timecode scale factor can help here
       in that it removes the need for proper rounding in the conversion
       from sample number to Raw Timecode.

   If you want some sample code for all these calculations you can have
   a look at this small C program.  For a given sample rate it will
   iterate over each sample, calculate the AbsoluteTimestamp and then
   re-calculate the sample number.

258.  Track Flags

258.1.  Default flag

   The "default track" flag is a hint for the playback application and
   SHOULD always be changeable by the user.  If the user wants to see or
   hear a track of a certain kind (audio, video, subtitles) and she
   hasn't chosen a specific track then the player SHOULD use the first
   track of that kind whose "default track" flag is set to "1".  If no
   such track is found then the first track of this kind SHOULD be
   chosen.

   Only one track of a kind MAY have its "default track" flag set in a
   segment.  If a track entry does not contain the "default track" flag
   element then its default value "1" is to be used.

258.2.  Forced flag

   The "forced" flag tells the playback application that it MUST
   display/play this track or another track of the same kind that also
   has its "forced" flag set.  When there are multiple "forced" tracks,
   the player SHOULD determined based upon the language of the forced
   flag or use the default flag if no track matches the use languages.
   Another track of the same kind without the "forced" flag may be use
   simultaneously with the "forced" track (like DVD subtitles for
   example).

259.  TrackTimecodeScale

   The TrackTimecodeScale [35] is used align tracks that would otherwise
   be played at different speeds.  An example of this would be if you
   have a film that was originally recorded at 24fps video.  When
   playing this back through a PAL broadcasting system, it is standard
   to speed up the film to 25fps to match the 25fps display speed of the
   PAL broadcasting standard.  However, when broadcasting the video
   through NTSC, it is typical to leave the film at its original speed.
   If you wanted to make a single file where there was one video stream,
   and an audio stream used from the PAL broadcast, as well as an audio
   stream used from the NTSC broadcast, you would have the problem that
   the PAL audio stream would be 1/24th faster than the NTSC audio
   stream, quickly leading to problems.  It is possible to stretch out
   the PAL audio track and reencode it at a slower speed, however when
   dealing with lossy audio codecs, this often results in a loss of
   audio quality and/or larger file sizes.

   This is the type of problem that TrackTimecodeScale was designed to
   fix.  Using it, the video can be played back at a speed that will

   synch with either the NTSC or the PAL audio stream, depending on
   which is being used for playback.  To continue the above example:

                            Track 1: Video
                            Track 2: NTSC Audio
                            Track 3: PAL Audio

   Because the NTSC track is at the original speed, it will used as the
   default value of 1.0 for its TrackTimecodeScale.  The video will also
   be aligned to the NTSC track with the default value of 1.0.

   The TrackTimecodeScale value to use for the PAL track would be
   calculated by determining how much faster the PAL track is than the
   NTSC track.  In this case, because we know the video for the NTSC
   audio is being played back at 24fps and the video for the PAL audio
   is being played back at 25fps, the calculation would be:

                   (25 / 24) = ~ 1.04166666666666666667

   When writing a file that uses a non-default TrackTimecodeScale, the
   values of the Block's timecode are whatever they would be when
   normally storing the track with a default value for the
   TrackTimecodeScale.  However, the data is interleaved a little
   differently.  Data SHOULD be interleaved by its Raw Timecode [36] in
   the order handed back from the encoder.  The Raw Timecode of a Block
   from a track using TrackTimecodeScale is calculated using:

   "(Block's Timecode + Cluster's Timecode) * TimecodeScale *
   TrackTimecodeScale"

   So, a Block from the PAL track above that had a Scaled Timecode [37]
   of 100 seconds would have a Raw Timecode of 104.66666667 seconds, and
   so would be stored in that part of the file.

   When playing back a track using the TrackTimecodeScale, if the track
   is being played by itself, there is no need to scale it.  From the
   above example, when playing the Video with the NTSC Audio, neither
   are scaled.  However, when playing back the Video with the PAL Audio,
   the timecodes from the PAL Audio track are scaled using the
   TrackTimecodeScale, resulting in the video playing back in synch with
   the audio.

   It would be possible for a player to also adjust the audio's
   samplerate at the same time as adjusting the timecodes if you wanted
   to play the two audio streams synchronously.  It would also be
   possible to adjust the video to match the audio's speed.  However,
   for playback, the selected track(s) timecodes SHOULD be adjusted if
   they need to be scaled.

   While the above example deals specifically with audio tracks, this
   element can be used to align video, audio, subtitles, or any other
   type of track contained in a Matroska file.

260.  Unknown elements

   Matroska is based upon the principal that a reading application does
   not have to support 100% of the specifications in order to be able to
   play the file.  A Matroska file therefore contains version indicators
   [38] that tell a reading application what to expect.

   It is possible and valid to have the version fields indicate that the
   file contains Matroska Elements from a higher specification version
   number while signalling that a reading application MUST only support
   a lower version number properly in order to play it back (possibly
   with a reduced feature set).  This implies that a reading application
   supporting at least Matroska version V reading a file whose
   DocTypeReadVersion field is equal to or lower than V MUST skip
   Matroska/EBML Elements it encounters but which it does not know about
   if that unknown element fits into the size constraints set by the
   current parent element.

261.  Multi-planar and 3D videos

   There are 2 different ways to compress 3D videos: have each 'eye'
   track in a separate track and have one track have both 'eyes'
   combined inside (which is more efficient, compression-wise).
   Matroska supports both ways.

   For the single track variant, there is the StereoMode [39] Element
   which defines how planes are assembled in the track (mono or left-
   right combined).  Odd values of StereoMode means the left plane comes
   first for more convenient reading.  The pixel count of the track
   (PixelWidth/PixelHeight) is the raw amount of pixels (for example
   3840x1080 for full HD side by side) and the DisplayWidth/Height in
   pixels is the amount of pixels for one plane (1920x1080 for that full
   HD stream).  Old stereo 3D were displayed using anaglyph (cyan and
   red colours separated).  For compatibility with such movies, there is
   a value of the StereoMode that corresponds to AnaGlyph.

   There is also a "packed" mode (values 13 and 14) which consists of
   packing 2 frames together in a Block using lacing.  The first frame
   is the left eye and the other frame is the right eye (or vice versa).
   The frames SHOULD be decoded in that order and are possibly dependent
   on each other (P and B frames).

   For separate tracks, Matroska needs to define exactly which track
   does what.  TrackOperation [40] with TrackCombinePlanes [41] do that.
   For more details look at how TrackOperation works [42].

   The 3D support is still in infancy and may evolve to support more
   features.



   /index.html#StereoMode) used to be part of Matroska v2 but it didn't
   meet the requirement for multiple tracks.  There was also a bug in
   libmatroska prior to 0.9.0 that would save/read it as 0x53B9 instead
   of 0x53B8.  Readers may support these legacy files by checking
   Matroska v2 or 0x53B9.  The olders values were 0: mono, 1: right eye,
   2: left eye, 3: both eyes

262.  Track Operation

   TrackOperation [43] allows combining multiple tracks to make a
   virtual one.  It uses 2 separate system to combine tracks.  One to
   create a 3D "composition" (left/right/background planes) and one to
   simplify join 2 tracks together to make a single track.

   A track created with TrackOperation is a proper track with a UID and
   all its flags.  However the codec ID is meaningless because each
   "sub" track needs to be decoded by its own decoder before the
   "operation" is applied.  The Cues corresponding to such a virtual
   track SHOULD be the sum of the Cues elements for each of the tracks
   it's composed of (when the Cues are defined per track).

   In the case of TrackJoinBlocks, the Blocks (from BlockGroup and
   SimpleBlock) of all the tracks SHOULD be used as if they were defined
   for this new virtual Track.  When 2 Blocks have overlapping start or
   end timecodes, it's up to the underlying system to either drop some
   of these frames or render them the way they overlap.  In the end this
   situation SHOULD be avoided when creating such tracks as you can
   never be sure of the end result on different platforms.

263.  Matroska Element Ordering Guidelines

   Except for the EBML Header and the CRC-32 Element, the EBML
   specification does not require any particular storage order for
   Elements.  The Matroska specification however defines mandates and
   recommendations for the ordering certain Elements in order facilitate
   better playback, seeking, and editing efficiency.  This section
   describes and offers rationale for ordering requirements and
   recommendations for Matroska.

263.1.  Top-Level Elements

   A valid Matroska file requires only one Top-Level Element, the "Info"
   Element; however, to be playable Matroska MUST also contain at least
   one "Tracks" and "Cluster" Element.  The first "Info" Element and the
   first "Tracks" Element MUST either be stored before the first
   "Cluster" Element or both be referenced by a "SeekHead" Element which
   occurs before the first "Cluster" Element.

   After a Matroska file has been created it could still be edited.  For
   example chapters, tags or attachments can be added.  When new Top-
   Level Elements are added to a Matroska file the "SeekHead" Element(s)
   MUST be updated so that the "SeekHead" Element(s) itemize the
   identify and position of all Top-Level Elements.  Editing, removing,
   or adding Elements to a Matroska file often requires that some
   existing Elements be voided or extended; therefore, it is RECOMMENDED
   to use Void Elements as padding in between Top-Level Elements.

263.2.  CRC-32

   As noted by the EBML specification, if a "CRC-32" Element is used
   then the "CRC-32" Element MUST be the first ordered Element within
   its Parent Element.  The Matroska specification recommends that "CRC-
   32" Elements SHOULD NOT be used as an immediate Child Element of the
   "Segment" Element; however all Top-Level Elements of an EBML Document
   SHOULD include a CRC-32 Element as a Child Element.

263.3.  SeekHead

   If used, the first "SeekHead" Element SHOULD be the first non-"CRC-
   32" Child Element of the "Segment" Element.  If a second "SeekHead"
   Element is used then the first "SeekHead" MUST reference the identity
   and position of the second "SeekHead", the second "SeekHead" MUST
   only reference "Cluster" Elements and not any other Top-Level
   Element, and the second "SeekHead" MAY be stored in any order
   relative to the other Top-Level Elements.  Whether one or two
   "SeekHead" Elements is used, the "SeekHead" Element(s) MUST reference
   the identify and position of all Top-Level Elements except for the
   first "SeekHead".

   It is RECOMMENDED that the first "SeekHead" Element be followed by
   some padding (a "Void" Element) to allow for the "SeekHead" Element
   to be expanded to cover new Top-Level Elements that could be added to
   the Matroska file, such as "Tags", "Chapters" and "Attachments"
   Elements.

263.4.  Cues (index)

   The "Cues" Element is RECOMMENDED to optimize seeking access in
   Matroska.  It is programmatically simpler to add the "Cues" Element
   after all of the "Cluster" Elements are written because this does not
   require a prediction of how much space to reserve before writing the
   "Cluster" Elements.  On the other hand, storing the "Cues" Element
   before the "Clusters" can provide some seeking advantages.

263.5.  Info

   The first "Info" Element SHOULD occur before the first "Tracks" and
   first "Cluster" Element.

263.6.  Chapters

   The "Chapters" Element SHOULD be placed before the "Cluster"
   Element(s).  The "Chapters" Element can be used during playback even
   if the user doesn't need to seek.  It immediately gives the user
   information of what section is being read and what other sections are
   available.  In the case of Ordered Chapters it RECOMMENDED to
   evaluate the logical linking even before starting playing anything.
   The "Chapters" Element SHOULD be placed before the first "Tracks"
   Element and after the first "Info" Element.

263.7.  Attachments

   The "Attachments" Element is not meant to use by default when playing
   the file, but could contain the cover art and/or fonts.  Cover art is
   useful even before the file is played and fonts could be needed
   before playback starts for initialization of subtitles that could use
   them.  The "Attachments" Element MAY be placed before the first
   "Cluster" Element; however if the "Attachments" Element is likely to
   be edited, then it SHOULD be placed after the last "Cluster" Element.

263.8.  Tags

   The "Tags" Element is the one that is most subject to changes after
   the file was originally created.  So for easier editing the "Tags"
   Element SHOULD be placed at the end of the "Segment" Element, even
   after the "Attachments" Element.  On the other hand, it is
   inconvenient to have to seek in the "Segment" for tags especially for
   network streams.  So it's better if the "Tags" Element(s) are found
   early in the stream.  When editing the "Tags" Element(s), the
   original "Tags" Element at the beginning can be voided [44] and a new
   one written right at the end [45] of the "Segment" Element.  The file
   size will only marginally change.

263.12.  Cluster Timecode

   As each "BlockGroup" and "SimpleBlock" of a "Cluster" Element needs
   the Cluster "Timecode", the "Timecode" Element MUST occur as the
   first Child Element within the "Cluster" Element.

264.  CodecID

   As an additional resource to this page Haali has created a list of
   codec IDs in a PDF [46].

   For each TrackEntry inside matroska [47], there has to be a CodecID
   [48] defined.  This ID is represent the codec used to encode data in
   the Track.  The codec works with the coded data in the stream, but
   also with some codec initialisation.  There are 2 different kind of
   codec "initialisation" :

   o  CodecPrivate in the TrackEntry

   o  CodecState in the BlockGroup

   Each of these elements contain the same kind of data.  And these data
   depend on the codec used.

   Important Note:

   Please, when reading through this list, always keep in mind that the
   intention behind it is "NOT" to list all existing audio and video
   codecs, but more to list those codecs that are "currently supported"
   in matroska (or will be supported soon), and therfore need a well
   defined codec ID so that all developers supporting matroska will use
   the same ID.  A list of all the codecs we plan to support in the
   future can be found on the CoreCodec forum [49] (subject to be
   changed constantly).  If you feel we missed support for a very
   important codec, please tell us on our development mailing list
   (matroska-devel at freelists.org).

   AC3/BSID9 and AC3/BSID10 (DolbyNet) : The ac3 frame header has,
   similar to the mpeg-audio header a version field.  Normal ac3 is
   defiened as bitstream id 8 (5 Bits, numbers are 0-15).  Everything
   below 8 is still compatible with all decoders that handle 8
   correctly.  Everything higher are additions that break decoder
   compatibility.  For the samplerates 24kHz (00); 22,05kHz (01) and
   16kHz (10) the BSID is 9 For the samplerates 12kHz (00); 11,025kHz

264.3.  Edition and chapter flags

264.3.1.  Chapter flags

   There are two important flags that apply to chapter atoms: _enabled_
   and _hidden_. The effect of those flags always applies to child atoms
   of an atom affected by that flag.

   For example: Let's assume a parent atom with flag _hidden_ set to
   _true_; that parent contains two child atom, the first with _hidden_
   set to _true_ as well and the second child with the flag either set
   to _false_ or not present at all (in which case the default value
   applies, and that again is _false_).

   As the parent is hidden all of its children are initially hidden as
   well.  However, when a control track toggles the parent's _hidden_
   flag to _false_ then only the the parent and its second child will be
   visible.  The first child's explicitely set flag retains its value
   until its value is toggled to _false_ by a control track.

   Corresponding behavior applies to the _enabled_ flag.

264.3.2.  Edition flags

   The edition's _hidden_ flag behaves much the same as the chapter's
   _hidden_ flag: if an edition is hidden then none of its children
   SHALL be visible, no matter their own _hidden_ flags.  If the edition
   is toggled to being visible then the chapter atom's _hidden_ flags
   decide whether or not the chapter is visible.

264.4.  Menu features

   The menu features are handled like a _chapter codec_. That means each
   codec has a type, some private data and some data in the chapters.

   The type of the menu system is defined by the ChapProcessCodecID
   parameter.  For now only 2 values are supported : 0 matroska script,
   1 menu borrowed from the DVD.  The private data depend on the type of
   menu system (stored in ChapProcessPrivate), idem for the data in the
   chapters (stored in ChapProcessData).

264.4.1.  Matroska Script (0)

   This is the case when ChapProcessCodecID [78] = 0.  This is a script
   language build for Matroska purposes.  The inspiration comes from
   ActionScript, javascript and other similar scripting languages.  The
   commands are stored as text commands, in UTF-8.  The syntax is C
   like, with commands spanned on many lines, each terminating with a
   ";".  You can also include comments at the end of lines with "//" or
   comment many lines using "/* */".  The scripts are stored in
   ChapProcessData.  For the moment ChapProcessPrivate is not used.

   The one and only command existing for the moment is "GotoAndPlay(
   ChapterUID );".  As the same suggests, it means that when this
   command is encountered, the playback SHOULD jump to the Chapter
   specified by the UID and play it.

264.4.2.  DVD menu (1)

   This is the case when ChapProcessCodecID [79] = 1.  Each level of a
   chapter corresponds to a logical level in the DVD system that is
   stored in the first octet of the ChapProcessPrivate.  This DVD
   hierarchy is as follows:

   | ChapProcessPrivate | DVD Name | Hierarchy | Commands Possible |
   Comment | | 0x30 | SS | DVD domain | - | First Play, Video Manager,
   Video Title | | 0x2A | LU | Language Unit | - | Contains only
   PGCs | | 0x28 | TT | Title | - | Contains only PGCs | | 0x20 | PGC |
   Program Group Chain (PGC) | * | | 0x18 | PG | Program 1 | Program 2 |
   Program 3 | - | | 0x10 | PTT | Part Of Title 1 | Part Of Title 2 |
   - | Equivalent to the chapters on the sleeve. | | 0x08 | CN | Cell
   1 | Cell 2 | Cell 3 | Cell 4 | Cell 5 | Cell 6 | - |

   You can also recover wether a Segment is a Video Manager (VMG), Video
   Title Set (VTS) or Video Title Set Menu (VTSM) from the
   ChapterTranslateID [80] element found in the Segment Info.  This
   field uses 2 octets as follows:

   1.  Domain Type: 0 for VMG, the domain number for VTS and VTSM

   2.  Domain Value: 0 for VMG and VTSM, 1 for the VTS source.

   For instance, the menu part from VTS_01_0.VOB would be coded [1,0]
   and the content part from VTS_02_3.VOB would be [2,1].  The VMG is
   always [0,0]

   The following octets of ChapProcessPrivate are as follows:

   code (1: 0x00= First play, 0xC0= VMG, 0x40= VTSM, 0x80= VTS) + VTS(M)
   number (2) | | 0x2A | LU | Language code (2) + Language extension

   ID(2)][Cell ID(1)][Angle Num(1)] |

   If the level specified in ChapProcessPrivate is a PGC (0x20), there
   is an octet called the Playback Type, specifying the kind of PGC
   defined:

   o  0x00: entry only/basic PGC

   o  0x82: Title+Entry Menu (only found in the Video Manager domain)

   o  0x83: Root Menu (only found in the VTSM domain)

   o  0x84: Subpicture Menu (only found in the VTSM domain)

   o  0x85: Audio Menu (only found in the VTSM domain)

   o  0x86: Angle Menu (only found in the VTSM domain)

   o  0x87: Chapter Menu (only found in the VTSM domain)

   The next 4 following octets correspond to the User Operation flags
   [81] in the standard PGC.  When a bit is set, the command SHOULD be
   disabled.

   ChapProcessData contains the pre/post/cell commands in binary format
   as there are stored on a DVD.  There is just an octet preceeding
   these data to specify the number of commands in the element.  As

265.  Subtitles

   Because Matroska is a general container format, we try to avoid
   specifying the formats to store in it.  This type of work is really
   outside of the scope of a container-only format.  However, because
   the use of subtitles in A/V containers has been so limited (with the
   exception of DVD) we are taking the time to specify how to store some

Internet-Draft                  Matroska                       July 2016


   of the more common subtitle formats in Matroska.  This is being done
   to help facilitate their growth.  Otherwise, incompatabilities could
   prevent the standardization and use of subtitle storage.

   This page is not meant to be a complete listing of all subtitle
   formats that will be used in Matroska, it is only meant to be a guide
   for the more common, current formats.  It is possible that we will
   add future formats to this page as they are created, but it is not
   likely as any other new subtitle format designer would likely have
   their own specifications.  Any specification listed here SHOULD be
   strictly adhered to or it SHOULD NOT use the corresponding Codec ID.

   Here is a list of pointers for storing subtitles in Matroska:

   o  Any Matroska file containing only subtitles SHOULD use the
      extension ".mks".

   o  As a general rule of thumb for all codecs, information that is
      global to an entire stream SHOULD be stored in the CodecPrivate
      element.

   o  Start and stop timecodes that are used in a timecodes native
      storage format SHOULD be removed when being placed in Matroska as
      they could interfere if the file is edited afterwards.  Instead,
      the Blocks timecode and Duration SHOULD be used to say when the
      timecode is displayed.

   o  Because a "subtitle" stream is actually just an overlay stream,
      anything with a transparency layer could be use, including video.

266.  Images Subtitles

   The first image format that is a goal to import into Matroska is the
   VobSub subtitle format.  This subtitle type is generated by exporting
   the subtitles from a DVD.

   The requirement for muxing VobSub into Matroska is v7 subtitles (see
   first line of the .IDX file).  If the version is smaller, you must
   remux them using the SubResync utility from VobSub 2.23 (or MPC) into
   v7 format.  Generally any newly created subs will be in v7 format.

   The .IFO file will not be used at all.

   If there is more than one subtitle stream in the VobSub set, each
   stream will need to be seperated into seperate tracks for storage in
   Matroska.  E.g. the VobSub file contains streams for both English and
   German subtitles.  Then the resulting Matroska file SHOULD contain

   two tracks.  That way the language information can be 'dropped' and
   mapped to Matroska's language tags.

   The .IDX file is reformatted (see below) and placed in the
   CodecPrivate.

   Each .BMP will be stored in its own Block.  The Timestamp with be
   stored in the Blocks Timecode and the duration will be stored in the
   Default Duration.

   Here is an example .IDX file:

  # VobSub index file, v7 (do not modify this line!)
  #
  # To repair desyncronization, you can insert gaps this way:
  # (it usually happens after vob id changes)
  #
  # delay: [sign]hh:mm:ss:ms
  #
  # Where:
  # [sign]: +, - (optional)
  # hh: hours (0 <= hh)
  # mm/ss: minutes/seconds (0 <= mm/ss <= 59)
  # ms: milliseconds (0 <= ms <= 999)
  #
  # Note: You can't position a sub before the previous with a negative
  # value.
  #
  # You can also modify timestamps or delete a few subs you don't like.
  # Just make sure they stay in increasing order.

  # Settings

  # Image scaling (hor,ver), origin is at the upper-left corner or at
  # the alignment coord (x, y)

  # Alpha blending

   First, lines beginning with "#" are removed.  These are comments to
   make text file editing easier, and as this is not a text file, they
   aren't needed.

   Next remove the "langidx" and "id" lines.  These are used to
   differenciate the subtitle streams and define the language.  As the
   streams will be stored seperately anyway, there is no need to
   differenciate them here.  Also, the language setting will be stored
   in the Matroska tags, so there is no need to store it here.

   Finally, the "timestamp" will be used to set the Block's timecode.
   Once it is set there, there is no need for it to be stored here.

   Also, as it may interfere if the file is edited, it SHOULD NOT be
   stored here.

   Once all of these items are removed, the data to store in the

  custom colors: OFF, tridx: 0000, colors: 000000, 000000, 000000, \
  000000

   There SHOULD also be two Blocks containing one image each with the
   timecodes "00:00:01:101" and "00:00:08:708".

267.  SRT Subtitles

   SRT is perhaps the most basic of all subtitle formats.

   It consists of four parts, all in text..

   1.  A number indicating which subtitle it is in the sequence.  2.
   The time that the subtitle appears on the screen, and then
   disappears.  3.  The subtitle itself.  4.  A blank line indicating
   the start of a new subtitle.

   When placing SRT in Matroska, part 3 is converted to UTF-8 (S_TEXT/
   UTF8) and placed in the data portion of the Block.  Part 2 is used to
   set the timecode of the Block, and BlockDuration element.  Nothing
   else is used.

   Here is an example SRT file:

   |

   1 00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,375 Senator, we're making our final
   approach into Coruscant.

   2 00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:22,501 Very good, Lieutenant.

Internet-Draft                  Matroska                       July 2016


   |

   In this example, the text "Senator, we're making our final approach
   into Coruscant." would be converted into UTF-8 and placed in the
   Block.  The timecode of the block would be set to "00:02:17,440".
   And the BlockDuration element would be set to "00:00:02,935".

   The same is repeated for the next subtitle.

   Because there are no general settings for SRT, the CodecPrivate is
   left blank.

268.  SSA/ASS Subtitles

   SSA stands for Sub Station Alpha.  It's the file format used by the
   popular subtitle editor, SubStation Alpha [84].  This format is
   widely used by fansubbers.

   It allows you to do some advanced display features, like positioning,
   karaoke, style managements...

   For detailed information on SSA/ASS, see the SSA specs [85].  It
   includes an SSA specs description and the avanced features added by
   ASS format (standing for Advanced SSA).  Because SSA and ASS are so
   similar, they are treated the same here.

   Like SRT, this format is text based with a particular syntax.

   A file consists of 4 or 5 parts, declared ala INI file (but it's not
   an INI !)

   The first, "[Script Info]" contains some information about the
   subtitle file, such as it's title, who created it, type of script and
   a very important one : "PlayResY".  Be carefull of this value,
   everything in your script (font size, positioning) is scaled by it.
   Sub Station Alpha uses your desktops Y resolution to write this
   value, so if a friend with a large monitor and a high screen
   resolution gives you an edited script, you can mess everything up by
   saving the script in SSA with your low-cost monitor.

   The second, "[V4 Styles]", is a list of style definitions.  A style
   describe how will look a text on the screen.  It defines font, font
   size, primary/.../outile colour, position, aligment etc ...

   For example this :

   |

   The third, "[Events]", is the list of text you want to display at the
   right timing.  You can specify some attribute here.  Like the style
   to use for this event (MUST be defined in the list), the position of
   the text (Left, Right, Vertical Margin), an effect.  Name is mostly
   used by translator to know who said this sentence.  Timing is in
   h:mm:ss.cc (centisec).

   Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:42.42,0:02:44.15,Wolf
   main,autre,0000,0000,0000,,Toujours rien.

   |

   "[Pictures]" or "[Fonts]" part can be found in some SSA file, they
   contains UUE-encoded pictures/font but those features are only used
   by Sub Station Alpha, i.e. no filter (Vobsub/Avery Lee Subtiler
   filter) use them.

   Now, how are they stored in Matroska ?

   o  All text is converted to UTF-8* All the headers are stored in
      CodecPrivate ( Script Info and the Styles list)* Start & End field
      are used to set TimeStamp and the BlockDuration element. the data
      stored is :* Events are stored in the Block in this order:
      ReadOrder, Layer, Style, Name, MarginL, MarginR, MarginV, Effect,
      Text (Layer comes from ASS specs ... it's empty for SSA.)
      "ReadOrder field is needed for the decoder to be able to reorder
      the streamed samples as they were placed originally in the file."

   Here is an example of an SSA file.

270.  WebVTT

   The "Web Video Text Tracks Format" (short: WebVTT) is developed by
   the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [90].  Its specifications are
   freely available [91].

   The guiding principles for the storage of WebVTT in Matroska are:

   o  Consistency: store data in a similar way to other subtitle codecs

   o  Simplicity: making decoding and remuxing as easy as possible for
      existing infrastructures

   o  Completeness: keeping as much data as possible from the original
      WebVTT file

270.1.  Storage of WebVTT in Matroska

270.1.1.  CodecID: codec identification

   The CodecID to use is S_TEXT/WEBVTT.

270.1.2.  CodecPrivate: storage of gloal WebVTT blocks

   This element contains all global blocks before the first subtitle
   entry.  This starts at the "WEBVTT" file identification marker but
   excludes the optional byte order mark.

270.1.3.  Storage of non-global WebVTT blocks

   Non-global WebVTT blocks (e.g.  "NOTE") before a WebVTT Cue Text are
   stored in Matroska's BlockAddition element together with the Matroska
   Block containing the WebVTT Cue Text these blocks precede (see below
   for the actual format).

Internet-Draft                  Matroska                       July 2016


270.1.4.  Storage of Cues in Matroska blocks

   Each WebVTT Cue Text is stored directly in the Matroska Block.

   A muxer MUST change all WebVTT Cue Timestamps present within the Cue
   Text to be relative to the Matroska Block's timestamp.

   The Cue's start timestamp is used as the Matroska Block's timestamp.

   The difference between the Cue's end timestamp and its start
   timestamp is used as the Matroska Block's duration.

270.1.5.  BlockAdditions: storing non-global WebVTT blocks, Cue Settings
          Lists and Cue identifiers

   Each Matroska Block may be accompanied by one BlockAdditions element.
   Its format is as follows:

   1.  The first line contains the WebVTT Cue Text's optional Cue
       Settings List followed by one line feed character (U+0x000a).
       The Cue Settings List may be empty in which case the line
       consists of the line feed character only.

   2.  The second line contains the WebVTT Cue Text's optional Cue
       Identifier followed by one line feed character (U+0x000a).  The
       line may be empty indicating that there was no Cue Identifier in
       the source file in which case the line consists of the line feed
       character only.

   3.  The third and all following lines contain all WebVTT Comment
       Blocks that precede the current WebVTT Cue Block.  These may be
       absent.

   If there is no Matroska BlockAddition element stored together with
   the Matroska Block then all three components (Cue Settings List, Cue
   Identifier, Cue Comments) MUST be assumed to be absent.

270.2.  Examples of transformation

   Here's an example how a WebVTT is transformed.

270.2.1.  Example WebVTT file

   Let's take the following example file:

Internet-Draft                  Matroska                       July 2016


270.2.2.  CodecPrivate

   The resulting CodecPrivate element will look like this:

270.2.3.  Storage of Cue 1

   Example Cue 1: timestamp 00:00:00.000, duration 00:00:10.000, Block's
   content:

   BlockAddition's content starts with one empty line as there's no Cue
   Settings List:

270.2.4.  Storage of Cue 2

   Example Cue 2: timestamp 00:00:25.000, duration 00:00:10.000, Block's
   content:

   BlockAddition's content starts with two empty lines as there's
   neither a Cue Settings List nor a Cue Identifier:

270.2.5.  Storage of Cue 3

   Example Cue 3: timestamp 00:01:03.000, duration 00:00:03.500, Block's
   content:

   BlockAddition's content ends with an empty line as there's no Cue
   Identifier and there were no WebVTT Comment blocks:

270.2.6.  Storage of Cue 4

   Example Cue 4: timestamp 00:03:10.000, duration 00:00:10.000, Block's
   content:

   Example entry 4: Entries can even include timestamps.  For
   example:<00:00:05.000>This becomes visible five seconds after the
   first part.

   This Block does not need a BlockAddition as the Cue did not contain
   an Identifier, nor a Settings List, and it wasn't preceded by Comment
   blocks.

270.3.  Storage of WebVTT in Matroska vs. WebM

   Note: the storage of WebVTT in Matroska is not the same as the design
   document for storage of WebVTT in WebM.  There are several reasons
   for this including but not limited to: the WebM document is old (from
   February 2012) and was based on an earlier draft of WebVTT and
   ignores several parts that were added to WebVTT later; WebM does

   still not support subtitles at all [92]; the proposal suggests
   splitting the information across multiple tracks making demuxer's and
   remuxer's life very difficult.---

271.  Tagging

   When a Tag is nested within another Tag, the nested Tag becomes an
   attribute of the base tag.  For instance, if you wanted to store the
   dates that a singer used certain addresses for, that singer being the
   lead singer for a track that included multiple bands simultaneously,
   then your tag tree would look something like this: Targets - TrackUID
   BAND - LEADPERFORMER -- ADDRESS --- DATE --- DATEEND -- ADDRESS ---
   DATE In this way, it becomes possible to store any Tag as attributes
   of another tag.  Multiple items SHOULD never be stored as a list in a
   single TagString.  If there is more than one tag of a certain type to
   be stored, then more than one SimpleTag SHOULD be used.  For
   authoring Tags outside of EBML, the following XML syntax is proposed
   [93] used in mkvmerge [94].  Binary data SHOULD be stored using
   BASE64 encoding if it is being stored at authoring time.

271.1.  Why official tags matter

   There is a debate between people who think all tags SHOULD be free
   and those who think all tags SHOULD be strict.  If you look at this
   page you will realise we are in between.

   Advanced-users application might let you put any tag in your file.
   But for the rest of the applications, they usually give you a basic
   list of tags you can use.  Both have their needs.  But it's usually a
   bad idea to use custom/exotic tags because you will probably be the
   only person to use this information even though everyone else could
   benefit from it.  So hopefully when someone wants to put information
   in one's file, they will find an official one that fit them and
   hopefully use it ! If it's not in the list, this person can contact
   us any time for addition of such a missing tag.  But it doesn't mean
   it will be accepted... Matroska files are not meant the become a
   whole database of people who made costumes for a film.  A website
   would be better for that... It's hard to define what SHOULD be in and
   what doesn't make sense in a file.  So we'll treat each request
   carefully.

   We also need an official list simply for developpers to be able to
   display relevant information in their own design (if they choose to
   support a list of meta-information they SHOULD know which tag has the
   wanted meaning so that other apps could understand the same meaning).

271.2.  Tag translations

   To be able to save tags from other systems to Matroska we need to
   translate them to our system.  There is a translation table on our
   site [95].

271.3.  Tag Formatting

   o  The TagName SHOULD always be written in all capital letters and
      contain no space.

   o  The fields with dates SHOULD have the following format: YYYY-MM-DD
      HH:MM:SS.MSS YYYY = Year, -MM = Month, -DD = Days, HH = Hours, :MM
      = Minutes, :SS = Seconds, :MSS = Milliseconds.  To store less
      accuracy, you remove items starting from the right.  To store only
      the year, you would use, "2004".  To store a specific day such as
      May 1st, 2003, you would use "2003-05-01".

   o  Fields that require a Float SHOULD use the "." mark instead of the
      "," mark.  To display it differently for another local,
      applications SHOULD support auto replacement on display.  Also, a
      thousandths separator SHOULD NOT be used.

   o  For currency amounts, there SHOULD only be a numeric value in the
      Tag. Only numbers, no letters or symbols other than ".".  For
      instance, you would store "15.59" instead of "$15.59USD".

271.4.  Target types

   The TargetType element allows tagging of different parts that are
   inside or outside a given file.  For example in an audio file with
   one song you could have information about the album it comes from and
   even the CD set even if it's not found in the file.

   For application to know what kind of information (like TITLE) relates
   to a certain level (CD title or track title), we also need a set of
   official TargetType names.  For now audio and video will have
   different values & names.  That also means the same tag name can have
   different meanings depending on where it is (otherwise we would end
   up with 15 TITLE_ tags).

   An upper level value tag applies to the lower level.  That means if a
   CD has the same artist for all tracks, you just need to set the
   ARTIST tag at level 50 (ALBUM) and not to each TRACK (but you can).
   That also means that if some parts of the CD have no known ARTIST the
   value MUST be set to nothing (a void string "").

   When a level doesn't exist it MUST NOT be specified in the files, so
   that the TOTAL_PARTS and PART_NUMBER elements match the same levels.

   Here is an example of how these "organizational" tags work: If you
   set 10 TOTAL_PARTS to the ALBUM level (40) it means the album
   contains 10 lower parts.  The lower part in question is the first
   lower level that is specified in the file.  So if it's TRACK (30)
   then that means it contains 10 tracks.  If it's MOVEMENT (20) that
   means it's 10 movements, etc.

271.5.  Official tags

   The following is a complete list of the supported Matroska Tags.
   While it is possible to use Tag names that are not listed below, this
   is not reccommended as compatability will be compromised.  If you
   find that there is a Tag missing that you would like to use, then
   please contact the Matroska team for its inclusion in the
   specifications before the format reaches 1.0.

271.6.  Notes

   o  In the Target list, a logicial OR is applied on all tracks, a
      logicial OR is applied on all chapters.  Then a logical AND is
      applied between the Tracks list and the Chapters list to know if
      an element belongs to this Target.

   With the rise of Media Centers and even programs to manage large
   amounts of audio files, it's becoming necessary to visualize your
   files easily, not just browse by names.  It is also a lot nicer to
   browse for the user.  Matroska supports attachments and they can be
   used for cover arts.  This document defines a set of guidelines for
   coders and file creators to add cover arts correctly in Matroska
   files.  These guidelines will ensure the user experience is good and
   consistent wherever you put your files.

   The pictures SHOULD only use the JPEG and PNG picture formats.

   There can be 2 different cover for a movie/album.  A portrait one
   (like a DVD case) and a landscape one (like a banner ad for example,
   looking better on a wide screen).

   There can be 2 versions of the same cover, the normal one and the
   small one.  The dimension of the normal one SHOULD be 600 on the
   smallest side (eg 960x600 for landscape and 600x800 for portrait,
   600x600 for square).  The dimension of the small one SHOULD be 120
   (192x120 or 120x160).

   The way to differentiate between all these versions is by the
   filename.  The default filename is cover.(png/jpg) for backward
   compatibility reasons.  That is the "big" version of the file (600)
   in square or portrait mode.  It SHOULD also be the first file in the
   attachments.  The smaller resolution SHOULD be prefixed with
   "small_", ie small_cover.(jpg/png).  The landscape variant SHOULD be
   suffixed with "_land", ie cover_land.jpg.  The filenames are case
   sensitive and SHOULD all be lower case.

   o  cover.jpg (portrait/square 600)

   o  small_cover.png (portrait/square 120)

   o  cover_land.png (landscape 600)

   o  small_cover_land.jpg (landscape 120)

   There is a sample file [96] available to test player compatibility or
   to demonstrate the use of cover art in Matroska files.---

272.  Matroska Streaming

   There exist multiple ways to stream a content.  The term streaming
   itself is very vague.  It means reading a file stored on a server.
   But the server could be very distant or very close.  The transport
   system and the protocol used for streaming makes the whole
   difference.

   In the case of Matroska, there are mostly 2 different kinds of
   stream: file access and live streaming.

273.  File Access

   File access can simply be reading a file located on your computer,
   but also accessing it from an HTTP (web) server or CIFS (windows
   share) server.  All these protocols are usually safe from reading
   errors and seeking in the stream is possible.  On other hand when the
   file is stored far away or on a slow server, seeking can be an
   expensive operation and SHOULD be avoided.  That's why we set a few
   guidelines [97] that, when followed, help reduce the number of
   seeking for regular playback and also have the playback start quickly
   without a lot of data needed to read first (like the Cues (index),
   Attachments or Meta Seek of all the Clusters).

   Matroska having a small overhead, it is well suited for storing
   music/videos on file servers without having a big impact on the
   bandwidth used.  It doesn't require to load the index before playing

Internet-Draft                  Matroska                       July 2016


   (the index can be loaded only when seeking is requested the first
   time), so playback can start very quickly too.

274.  Live Streaming

   Live streaming is the equivalent of TV broadcasting on the internet.
   There are 2 families of servers for that.  The RTP/RTSP ones and the
   HTTP servers.  Matroska is not meant to be used over RTP.  RTP
   already has timing and channel mechanisms that would wasted if
   doubled in Matroska.  On the other hand live streaming of Matroska
   over HTTP (or any other plain protocol based on TCP) is very
   possible.

   A live Matroska stream is different than a file, because it may have
   no known end (only when the client disconnects).  For that the
   Segment MUST use the "unknown" size (all 1s in the size).  The other
   option would be to concatenate Segments with known sizes one after
   the other.  This solution allows a change of codec/resolution between
   each segment which can be useful in some cases (switch between 4:3
   and 16:9 in some TV programs for example).

   The Segment(s) being continuous, certain elements like Meta Seek,
   Cues, Chapters, Attachments MUST NOT be used in this context.

   On the player side, it is possible to detect that a stream is not
   seekable.  If the stream does not have a Meta Seek list or a Cues
   list at the beginning of the stream, it SHOULD be considered as non
   seekable.  Even though it's still theoretically possible to seek
   blindly forward in the stream, if the server supports it.

   In the context of a live radio or even web TV it is possible to "Tag"
   the content that is currently playing.  The Tags level 1 element can
   be placed between Clusters each time necessary.  In that case, the
   new Tags found MUST reset the previously encountered tags and use the
   new values instead (be they empty).

275.  Menu Specifications

276.  Introduction

   This document is a _draft of the Menu system_ that will be the
   default one in Matroska.  As it will just be composed of a Control
   Track, it will be seen as a "codec" and could be replaced later by
   something else if needed.

   A menu is like what you see on DVDs, when you have some screens to
   select the audio format, subtitles or scene selection.

277.  Requirements

   What we'll try to have is a system that can do almost everything done
   on a DVD, or more, or better, or drop the unused features if
   necessary.

   As the name suggests, a Control Track is a track that can control the
   playback of the file and/or all the playback features.  To make it as
   simple as possible for players, the Control Track will just give
   orders to the player and get the actions associated with the
   highlights/hotspots.

277.1.  Highlights/Hotspots

   A hightlight is basically a rectangle/key associated with an action
   UID.  When that rectangle/key is activated, the player send the UID
   of the action to the Control Track handler (codec).  The fact that it
   can also be a key means that even for audio only files, a keyboard
   shortcut or button panel could be used for menues.  But in that case,
   the hotspot will have to be associated with a name to display.

   So this hightlight is sent from the Control Track to the Player.
   Then the player has to handle that highlight until it's disactivated
   (see Playback features [98])

   The hightlight contains a UID of the action, a displayable name (UTF-
   8), an associated key (list of keys to be defined, probably
   up/down/left/right/select), a screen position/range and an image to
   display.  The image will be displayed either when the user place the
   mouse over the rectangle (or any other shape), or when an option of
   the screen is selected (not activated).  There could be a second
   image used when the option is activated.  And there could be a third
   image that can serve as background.  This way you could have a still
   image (like in some DVDs) for the menu and behind that image blank
   video (small bitrate).

   When a highlight is activated by the user, the player has to send the
   UID of the action to the Control Track.  Then the Control Track codec
   will handle the action and possibly give new orders to the player.

   The format used for storing images SHOULD be extensible.  For the
   moment we'll use PNG and BMP, both with alpha channel.

277.2.  Playback features

   All the following features will be sent from the Control Track to the
   Player :

   o  Jump to chapter (UID, prev, next, number)

   o  Disable all tracks of a kind (audio, video, subtitle)

   o  Enable track UID (the kind doesn't matter)

   o  Define/Disable a highlight

   o  Enable/Disable jumping

   o  Enable/Disable track selection of a kind

   o  Select Edition ID (see chapters)

   o  Pause playback

   o  Stop playback

   o  Enable/Disable a Chapter UID

   o  Hide/Unhide a Chapter UID

   All the actions will be writen in a normal Matroska track, with a
   timecode.  A "Menu Frame" SHOULD be able to contain more that one
   action/highlight for a given timecode. (to be determined, EBML format
   structure)

277.3.  Player requirements

   Some players might not support the control track.  That mean they
   will play the active/looped parts as part of the data.  So I suggest
   putting the active/looped parts of a movie at the end of a movie.
   When a Menu-aware player encouter the default Control Track of a
   Matroska file, the first order SHOULD be to jump at the start of the
   active/looped part of the movie.

279.  Ideas

280.  Data Structure

   As a Matroska side project, the obvious choice for storing binary
   data is EBML.---

281.  Overhead

   One of the way to compare containers is to analyze the overhead
   produced for the same raw data.  The overhead is the amount of data
   added to these raw data, due to the internal structure of the format.

   This document is only giving the overhead introduced by matroska.  It
   is intended for the matroska team to better tune the format for
   efficiency.  And also specify where matroska is best suited.

281.1.  Example 1 - low bitrate audio

   Low bitrate audio (like speex or vorbis) is usually using very small
   packets of data, all independent ones (no reference to previous or
   future frames).  The bitrate can be as low as 8kbps (to 64kbps).  For
   8kbps you have 1kBps.  If you cut that into 20ms parts, that makes
   approximately 100 bytes (to 1000 bytes) per part (packet).  Low
   bitrate codec are usually tuned for real-time conferencing on limited
   bandwidth lines, so the VBR aspect is usually limited.  That's why we
   will consider that bitrate to be constant, ie the size of packets.

   *explanations :* This is the overhead introduced by the Block level.
   There is more overhead in a matroska file, ie the Cluster head (that
   contains many Blocks) and the file header (containing various meta
   information).

   the first number is the number is the size of the total Block+Data,
   ie element ID (1), size (1 to 8), Block head (4), lacing (0 to
   infinite), data

   the second number is the pourcentage of overhead for each packet

   In matroska, synchronisation and error recovery is done with a
   Cluster.  A cluster contains 1 to many Blocks.  So let's see the
   effect of having 1 Block per Cluster, 2 Blocks per Cluster and 3
   Blocks per Cluster.  These are the worst cases where synchronisation
   is necessary often, ie every 20, 40 and 60ms (with 1 block only).  A
   value of 1s is a pretty agressive case and is the minimum supported
   here (just to save me from a few calculus).

   *explanations :* the third number is the max time between 2 error
   recoveries (re-sync) in milliseconds.  This is based on the example
   of all frames have a 20ms granularity.

281.1.1.  Conclusions

   o  For the same error-recovery (1.2s, 2.4s) we clearly see that it's
      better to put as much data in one Block and use lacing.  In this
      case there will be 1 Block per Cluster.  One of the drawback is
      that only the first packet of data has a timecode (one timecode
      every second).

   o  If we agree that 2% overhead is OK for low bitrates (the same as
      for MP3), the minimum bitrate acceptable is between 8kbps and
      16kbps (probably closer to 16 kbps).  Actually this value depend
      on the block size and not really the bitrate.

   o  For bitrates higher than 48kbps (or a fixed packet rate of 600
      bytes) the overhead is very good even with one frame per packet.

281.2.  Example 2 - medium bitrate audio

281.3.  Example 3 - high bitrate audio

281.4.  Example 4 - low bitrate video

   Low bitrate video is, like low bitrate audio, the worst case for
   overhead.  The range we will use here is 64 kbps to 256kbps.  I think
   these are reasonable values for what can be considered as low video
   bitrate.

   One of the major difference in video is that the number of frame per
   second is fixed (10 to 30 for low bitrates).

   Another difference is that the frames usually depend on others to
   save some compression bits.  One of the effect is that all frames
   don't have the same size.  You have key frames (I) that don't depend
   on other frames, (P) frames that depend on an older frame and (B)
   frames that rely on an older and a future frame.

   It is mandatory that all I frames have an actual timecode coming from
   the container, because the P and B frames will rely on that timecode
   for reference.

281.4.1.  First example - all I frames (CBR)

   With all I frames, the average data is easy to compute.  For
   64kbps=8kBps we have a frame=1/20s.  That means each frame is 400
   bytes big.  So the results are similar to 32kbps audio.

   Lacing SHOULD NOT be used for better seeking in the file.  But it is
   still possible for use in this particular case.

   *Conslusions :*

   o  In most cases, the best result is when 8 Blocks are packed in a
      Cluster.  Bigger values don't improve the overhead much.  It also
      seems to be a good value to stop using lacing in the low audio
      bitrate example. *So both lacing and clustering will be limited to
      8 elements in libmatroska* on writing.

   o  In an agressive case like a 64kbps CBR video codec at 20 frames/
      sec can still achieve an overhead of less than 2% which is quite
      good.

   o  Upper 128kbps an overhead of less than 1% can always be achieved.

   o  Having 2 frames in a lace can improve substantially the overhead.
      But as I frames SHOULD always have a proper timecode, it is not
      possible to use this solution.

281.4.2.  Second example - 1 I frame for 1 B frame

   In this case, each frame has to be separated in a Block (no lacing
   possible).  The reference timecode in matroska (of the previous
   frame) is written in a separate element
   ([BlockAddition][TimecodeReference]).  So more overhead is
   introduced.

   We will establish that the P frame is 3x smaller than the I frame (I
   hope this is a realistic case).  That means that, at 20 frames per
   second, for 64 kbps the I frame is 600 bytes and the B frame is 200
   bytes (2 frames are 2*400 bytes big).

   *Conclusions :*

   o  As for the previous case, 8 Blocks per Cluster seem to be the
      optimum value.

   o  The use of B frame degrades the overhead by approximately 0.5%. It
      is due to the additional backward reference.

   o  A bitrate of over 128 kbps still have a good overhead.  But the
      2.4% for 64kbps is still acceptable.
