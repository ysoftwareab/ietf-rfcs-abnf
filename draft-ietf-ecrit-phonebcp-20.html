  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Terminology</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="#RFC2119">[RFC2119]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">This document uses terms from <a href="#RFC3261">[RFC3261]</a>, <a href="#RFC5012">[RFC5012]</a> and <a href="#I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework">[I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework]</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">This document describes how access networks, Session Initiation Protocol <a href="#RFC3261">[RFC3261]</a> user agents, proxy servers and Public Safety Access Points (PSAPs) support emergency calling, as outlined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework">[I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework]</a>, which is designed to complement the present document in section headings, numbering and content. Understanding <a href="#I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework">[I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework]</a> is necessary to understand this document.  This BCP succinctly describes the requirements of end devices and applications (requirements prefaced by "ED-"), access networks (including enterprise access networks) (requirements prefaced by "AN-"), service providers (requirements prefaced by "SP-") and PSAPs to achieve globally interoperable emergency calling on the Internet. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">This document also defines requirements for "Intermediate" devices which exist between end devices or applications and the access network.  For example, a home router is an "Intermediate" device.  Reporting location on an emergency call (see <a href="#Location">Section 6</a>) may depend on the ability of such intermediate devices to meet the requirements prefaced by "INT-".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">The access network requirements apply to those networks which may be used to place emergency calls using IETF protocols.  Local regulations may impact the need to support this document's access network requirements.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">Other organizations, such as the North American Emergency Number Association (NENA), define the PSAP interface.  NENA's documents reference this document.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> Overview of how emergency calls are placed</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">An emergency call can be distinguished (<a href="#Identifying">Section 5</a>) from any other call by a unique Service URN <a href="#RFC5031">[RFC5031]</a>, which is placed in the call set-up signaling when a home or visited emergency dial string is detected. Because emergency services are local to specific geographic regions, a caller must obtain his location (<a href="#Location">Section 6</a>) prior to making emergency calls. To get this location, either a form of measuring (e.g., GPS) (<a href="#EndSystemMeasuredLocation">Section 6.2.3</a>) device location in the endpoint is deployed, or the endpoint is configured (<a href="#LocationConfiguration">Section 6.5</a>) with its location from the access network's Location Information Server (LIS).

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">Handling location for emergency calling usually involves several steps to process and multiple entities are involved. In Internet emergency calling, where the endpoint is located is "determined" using a variety of measurement or wiretracing methods. Endpoints can be "configured" with their own location by the access network. In some circumstances, a proxy server can insert location into the signaling on behalf of the endpoint. The location is "mapped" to the URI to send the call to, and the location is "conveyed" to the PSAP (and other entities) in the signaling. Likewise, we employ Location Configuration Protocols (LCPs), the Location-to-Service Mapping Protocol, and Location Conveyance Protocols for these functions.

<ol>
<li>The Request URI SHOULD be the service URN in the "sos" tree. If the device does not interpret local dial strings, the Request-URI MUST be a dial string URI <a href="#RFC4967">[RFC4967]</a> with the dialed digits.</li>
<li>The To header field SHOULD be a service URN in the "sos" tree. If the device does not interpret local dial strings, the To: MUST be a dial string URI with the dialed digits.</li>
<li>The From header field SHOULD contain the AoR of the caller.</li>
<li>A Route header field SHOULD be present with a PSAP URI obtained from LoST (see <a href="#Routing">Section 8</a>). If the device does not interpret dial plans, or was unable to obtain a route from a LoST server, no such Route header field will be present.</li>
<li>A Contact header field MUST be globally routable, for example a GRUU <a href="#RFC5627">[RFC5627]</a>, and be valid for several minutes following the termination of the call, provided that the UAC remains registered with the same registrar, to permit an immediate call-back to the specific device which placed the emergency call.  It is acceptable if the UAC inserts a locally routable URI and a subsequent B2BUA maps that to a globally routable URI.</li>
<li>Other header fields MAY be included as per normal SIP behavior.</li>
<li>If a geolocation URI is included in the INVITE, a Supported header field MUST be included with a 'geolocation-sip' or 'geolocation-http" option tag, as appropriate.  <a href="#I-D.ietf-sipcore-location-conveyance">[I-D.ietf-sipcore-location-conveyance]</a>.</li>
<li>If a device understands the SIP location conveyance <a href="#I-D.ietf-sipcore-location-conveyance">[I-D.ietf-sipcore-location-conveyance]</a> extension and has its location available, it MUST include location either by-value, by-reference or both.</li>
<li>A SDP offer SHOULD be included in the INVITE. If voice is supported the offer SHOULD include the G.711 codec, see <a href="#Media">Section 14</a>.  As PSAPs may support a wide range of media types and codecs, sending an offerless INVITE may result in a lengthy return offer, but is permitted.  Cautions in <a href="#RFC3261">[RFC3261]</a> on offerless INVITEs should be considered before such use.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.1">SP-33 SIP Proxy servers processing emergency calls: </p>

<ol>
<li>If the proxy interprets dial plans on behalf of user agents, the proxy MUST look for the local emergency dial string at the location of the end device and MAY look for the home dial string. If it finds it, the proxy MUST: <ul>
<li>Insert a Geolocation header field. Location-by-reference MUST be used because proxies must not insert bodies.</li>
<li>Insert the Geolocation-Routing header with appropriate parameters .</li>
<li>Map the location to a PSAP URI using LoST.</li>
<li>Add a Route header with the PSAP URI.</li>
<li>Replace the Request-URI (which was the dial string) with the service URN appropriate for the emergency dial string.</li>
<li>Route the call using normal SIP routing mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the proxy recognizes the service URN in the Request URI, and does not find a Route header, it MUST query a LoST server immediately. If a location was provided (which should be the case), the proxy uses that location to query LoST.  The proxy may have to dereference a location by reference to get a value.  If a location is not present, and the proxy can query a LIS which has the location of the UA it MUST do so.  If no location is present, and the proxy does not have access to a LIS which could provide location, the proxy MUST supply a default location (See <a href="#DefaultLocation">Section 6.11</a>).  The location (in the signaling, obtained from a LIS, or default) MUST be used in a query to LoST with the service URN received with the call.  The resulting URI MUST be placed in a Route header added to the call.</li>
<li>The proxy MAY add a Geolocation header field. Such an additional location SHOULD NOT be used for routing; the location provided by the UA should be used.</li>
<li>Either a P-Asserted-Identity <a href="#RFC3325">[RFC3325]</a> or an Identity header field <a href="#RFC4474">[RFC4474]</a>, or both, SHOULD be included to identify the sender. For services which must support emergency calls from unauthenticated devices, valid identity may not be available.  Proxies encountering a P-Asserted-Identity will need to pass the header to the PSAP, which is in a different domain. <a href="#RFC3325">[RFC3325]</a> requires a "spec(T)" to determine what happens if the "id" privacy service, or a Privacy header is present and requests privacy.  In the absence of another spec(T), such proxies should pass the header unmodified if and only if the connection between the proxy and the PSAP is, as far as the proxy can determine, protected by TLS with mutual authentication using keys reliably known by the parties, encrypted with no less strength than AES and the local regulations governing the PSAP do not otherwise specify.</li>
<li>Proxies SHOULD NOT return a 424 error.  It should process the INVITE as best as it can.</li>
<li>Proxies SHOULD NOT obey a Geolocation-Routing value of "no" or a missing value if the proxy must query LoST to obtain a route.  Emergency calls are always routed by location.</li>

As in standard SIP, a 200 (OK) response indicates that the address was recognized and a 404 (Not found) that it was not. A 486 (Busy Here) MUST be returned if the test service is busy, and a 404 (Not found) MUST be returned if the PSAP does not support the test mechanism.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.15.p.2">ED-79 In its response to the test, the PSAP MAY include a text body (text/plain) indicating the identity of the PSAP, the requested service, and the location reported with the call. For the latter, the PSAP SHOULD return location-by-value even if the original location delivered with the test was by-reference. If the location-by-reference was supplied, and the dereference requires credentials, the PSAP SHOULD use credentials supplied by the LIS for test purposes. This alerts the LIS that the dereference is not for an actual emergency call and location hiding techniques, if they are being used, may be employed for this dereference.  Use of SIPS for the request would assure the response containing the location is kept private </p>

The user agent would specify a loopback attribute of "loopback-source", the PSAP being the mirror.

This document suggests that security (TLS or IPsec) be used hop by hop on a SIP call to protect location information, identity, etc.  It also suggests that if the attempt to create a security association fails, the call be retried without the security.  It's more important to get an emergency call through than to protect the data; indeed, in many jurisdictions privacy is explicitly waived when making emergency calls.  Placing a call without security may reveal user information, including location.  The alternative - failing the call if security cannot be established, is considered unacceptable.</p>
