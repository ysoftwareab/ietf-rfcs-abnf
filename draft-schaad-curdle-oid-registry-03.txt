  IANA Registration for new Cryptographic Algorithm Object Identifier

                  draft-schaad-curdle-oid-registry-03

Abstract

   When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of
   object identifiers was donated by DigiCert, Inc. for the purpose of
   registering the Edwards Elliptic Curve key agreement and signature
   algorithms.  This donated set of OIDs allowed for shorter values than
   would be possible using the existing S/MIME or PKIX arcs.  This
   document describes the range of identifiers that were assigned in
   that donated range, transfers control of that range to IANA, and
   establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments
   within that range.

1.  Introduction

   When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of
   object identifiers was donated by DigiCert, Inc. for use by that
   working group.  The use of these object identifiers allowed for the
   Edwards Ellitptic Curve key agreement [RFC7748] and signature
   [RFC8032] algorithms to be defined with encodings that are smaller
   than similar ones would be if assigned from the existing S/MIME or
   PKIX arcs.  These initial registrations from this arc were done while
   developing [I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix].  After those registrations were
   done, there were still some unused values that can be used for other
   security groups.

   Object identifiers are primarily used with Abstract Syntax Notation
   (ASN.1) [ASN.1].  The ASN.1 specifications continue to evolve, but
   object identifiers can be used with any and all versions of ASN.1.

   This document describes the object identifiers that were assigned in
   that donated range, transfers control of the range to IANA, and
   establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments.

   The donated range from DigiCert, Inc. is:

   first: { iso (1) identified-organization (3) thawte (101) 100 }
   last: { iso (1) identified-organization (3) thawte (101) 127 }

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to create one new registry table.

2.1.  "SMI Security for Cryptographic Algorithms" Registry

   Within the SMI-numbers registry, add an "SMI Security for
   Cryptographic Algorithms" table with the three columns:

   +-----------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
   | Decimal   | Description               | References                |
   +-----------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
   | 0 - 99    | Retained by Digicert      | [I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix]    |
   |           |                           |                           |
   | 100       | Reserved for child reg    |                           |
   |           |                           |                           |
   | 110       | id-X25519                 | [I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix]    |
   |           |                           |                           |
   | 111       | id-X448                   | [I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix]    |
   |           |                           |                           |
   | 112       | id-EdDSA25519             | [I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix]    |
   |           |                           |                           |
   | 113       | id-EdDSA448               | [I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix]    |
   |           |                           |                           |
   | 114       | Reserved for id-          | [I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix-03] |
   |           | EdDSA25519-ph             |                           |
   |           |                           |                           |
   | 115       | Reserved for id-          | [I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix-03] |
   |           | EdDSA448-ph               |                           |
   |           |                           |                           |
   | 128 and   | Retained by Digicert      | [I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix]    |
   | up        |                           |                           |
   +-----------+---------------------------+---------------------------+

   The column 'Decimal' is required to be a number between 100 and 127
   inclusive.

   The value of 100 has been reserved so that a new arc below that point
   can be established in the future.  (I.e. starting at 1.3.101.100.1)
   If the new child registry is established, a name for this value is to
   be assigned at that point.  The experts can, at their discretion,
   assign an algorithm OID instead.

   The registry is to be created using the "Specification Required"
   policy as defined in [RFC8126].

3.  Security Considerations

   This document populates an IANA registry, and it raises no new
   security considerations.  The protocols that specify these values
   include the security considerations associated with their usage.

Acknowledgments

   Our thanks go out to DigiCert for donating the range of OIDs covered
   in this document.  At the time of the donation, the root of the range
   was assigned to Symantec but has sense been transfered DigiCert.

   This document uses a lot of text from a similar document by Russ
   Housley.  Copying always makes things easier and less error prone.
