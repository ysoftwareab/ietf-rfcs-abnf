         Application Enabled Collaborative Networking Use Cases
                     draft-conet-aeon-use-cases-00

Abstract

   This document describes application enabled collaborative networking
   use cases.  Application enabled collaborative networking has
   applications explicitly signal their flow characteristics to the
   network.  This provides network nodes with visibility of the
   application flow characteristics, which enables them to apply the
   correct flow treatment and provide feedback to applications.

1.  Introduction

   Identification and treatment of application flows are important to
   many application providers and network operators.  They often rely on
   these capabilities to deploy and/or support a wide range of
   applications.  These applications, and the packet flows they generate
   and consume, may have specific connectivity requirements that can be
   met if made known to the network.  Historically, this functionality
   has been implemented to the extent possible using heuristics, which
   inspect and infer flow characteristics.  Heuristics may be based on
   port ranges, network separation (e.g. subnets or VLANs, Deep Flow
   Inspection (DFI), or Deep Packet Inspection (DPI).  But many
   application flows in current usages are dynamic, adaptive, time-
   bound, encrypted, peer-to-peer, asymmetric, used on multipurpose
   devices, and have different priorities depending on direction of
   flow, user preferences, and other factors.  Any combination of these
   properties renders heuristic based techniques less effective and may
   result in compromises to application security or user privacy, as
   described in detail in draft-conet-aeon-problem-statement-00.

   Application enabled collaborative networking allows applications to
   explicitly signal their flow characteristics to the network.  This
   provides network nodes with visibility of the application flow
   characteristics.  These network nodes may take action based on this
   visibility and/or contribute to the flow description.  The resulting
   flow description may be communicated as feedback from the network to
   applications.  This proposes a way of building collaborative
   connections for network operators and application providers,
   benefiting both of them as well as users.  Network provider is able
   to manage the traffic going through the network more effectively, and
   application provider utilizes action taken by network on its traffic
   to meet user requirement and expectation.

   This document describes a set of use cases addressable by application
   enabled collaborative networking.

2.1.  Firewall Traversal: Identification of new applications

2.1.1.  Description of Problem

   Modern firewalls use application-layer gateways (ALGs) to perform
   policy enforcement.  For example firewalls implement SIP-aware
   Application Layer Gateway function, which examines the SIP signaling
   and opens the appropriate pinholes for the RTP media.  In particular
   firewall extracts media transport addresses, transport protocol and
   ports from session description and creates a dynamic mapping for
   media to flow through.  This model will not work in the following
   cases:

   1.  Session signaling is end-to-end encrypted (say, using TLS).

Internet-Draft            AEON/CONET Use Cases                  May 2014


   2.  Firewall does not understand the session signaling protocol, or
       extensions to the protocol, used by the endpoints (e.g.  WebRTC
       signaling protocols).

   3.  Session signaling and media traverse different firewalls (e.g.,
       signaling exits a network via one firewall whereas media exits a
       network via a different firewall).

   Enterprise networks that use firewalls with restrictive policies
   block new applications like WebRTC and delay deployment of killer
   applications.

2.1.2.  Proposed Solution

   The above problems can be addressed by the host getting authorization
   from the Application Server trusted by the network in order to
   install flows and associated actions (e.g., policies).  PCP third
   party authorization (draft-wing-pcp-third-party-authz-01) solves this
   problem by associating the media session with the signaling session.
   This is done by sending a cryptographic token in the signaling which
   authorizes the firewall mapping for the media session.

2.1.3.  User Benefit

   Enterprise networks that use firewalls with restrictive policies can
   deploy new applications at a faster rate for user benefit.

2.1.4.  Operator Benefit

   Enterprise firewalls can enforce restrictive policies without the
   need to be enhanced to perform ALG on new applications.  For example
   Enterprise firewall could have granular policies to permit peer-to-
   peer UDP media session only when the call is initiated using the
   selected WebRTC server (Dr.  Good) it trusts and block others (Dr.
   Evil).  PCP-aware firewalls can enforce such granular security
   policies without performing ALG on the session signaling protocols.
   This mechanism can be used by any other Application Function trusted
   by the network to permit time-bound, encrypted, peer-to-peer traffic.

2.1.5.  Application Benefit

2.1.6.  Flow characteristics provided by application

   The client requests dynamic mappings to permit flows required by the
   application.  This request includes a cryptographic token and
   characteristics of the flow, such as the anticipated bandwidth needs
   as well as the tolerance to delay, loss, and jitter.

Internet-Draft            AEON/CONET Use Cases                  May 2014


2.1.7.  Action taken by firewall as result of receiving flow
        characteristics

   The firewall uses the client request to permit and prioritize the
   traffic associated with those flows.  The cryptographic token
   provides authorization for the flows and their prioritization.

2.1.8.  Feedback provided by firewall

   Firewall matches the authorization data with what is requested in the
   request sent by the client.  If the authorization sets match, the
   firewall processes the request made by the client.  If the token is
   invalid or the request exceeds what is authorized by the token then
   firewall rejects the request.

2.1.9.  Security and Privacy Considerations

2.2.  Efficient Capacity Usage

2.2.1.  Description of Problem

   Network traffic is bursty and often follows diurnal usage patterns
   such that there are times of day where traffic levels are at a peak,
   and other times of day where they are at a valley.  Networks that are
   properly capacity planned need to have enough capacity to service the
   traffic demands at peak.  In a network with consistent demand and
   usage patterns, keeping up with demand is a matter of building
   capacity at a faster rate than the growth of the peak, in conjunction
   with any requirements for diversity and fault tolerance as well as
   any SLA for performance (latency, jitter, packet loss, etc) that may
   inform which traffic is passed, which is prioritized, and which may
   be dropped during periods of congestion.  However, there are several
   problems to consider in this context:

   1.  Simply building enough capacity for peak usage is not always
       efficient and cost-effective, because not all traffic is the same
       in terms of its need to transit the network at the exact moment
       it is currently doing so, but few tools exist to provide
       applications with the information they need to make more
       intelligent decisions on demand, and thus they default to "as
       soon as possible."  For example, those watching streaming video
       or doing real time communication or head to head gaming need
       immediate access, while less real-time activities such as data
       synchronization with the cloud for backups, or downloading
       software updates, or preloading content onto a CDN could
       potentially be deferred to times when more capacity is available,
       but today, all of that traffic competes for the same capacity at
       the same time.

   2.  QoS is not a substitute for capacity, and often a network
       designed for long periods of congested operation provides a poor
       user experience, since QoS ultimately is a method to identify
       which traffic should be dropped first.

   3.  When the network is not at peak usage, there is capacity sitting
       idle.  Even in a well-used network capacity is built in
       increments that may not match up with growth rate i.e. if a
       network adds capacity in increments of 10G or 100G, but only
       needed a small fraction of that until growth catches up.  This
       inefficiency is magnified when one considers the spare capacity
       designed into most networks to address the need to tolerate one
       or more failures in the network with minimal traffic impact.  In
       many cases, the idle capacity even at peak may be up to 50%, and
       at off peak, it could be much higher.

   4.  Few networks have truly consistent demand and usage patterns.
       While the average usage may follow a rough pattern, this does not
       always provide for flash demands, where a large number of users
       are simultaneously downloading an OS update, or all watching the
       same event via streaming video, or more heavily using the network
       due to being stuck at home during a snowstorm, etc.  The average
       usage patterns also do not take into account the effects of
       outages at shifting large volumes of traffic around in the
       network, and so managing these exception events either requires
       further spare capacity, or acknowledgement that some traffic will
       be dropped due to congestion, with the attendant impact to end
       user experience.

2.2.2.  Proposed Solution

   Addressing this problem requires a multi-part solution:

   o  Provide a mechanism for the network to communicate to applications
      when the network is busy and when it is not so that individual
      applications can manage their demand based on the nature of the
      application and its needs.  This demand management helps to smooth
      the traffic at peak by redirecting some of the demand to off-peak,
      and has an analog in the power utility industry where demand based
      pricing or smart grid technology signals devices that use a large
      amount of power so that they can be intelligent about those
      demands and reduce the burden on the available capacity of the
      electrical grid.

   o  Similarly, provide a means for applications to communicate their
      required performance envelope, as well as any data on how flexible
      the time of data transmission can be, i.e.  "I need this transfer
      to complete by $time on $day" or "I need this transfer to complete

      within 12 hours" etc.  This information can be used by the network
      to compute the best way to deliver the requested service, or to
      identify when it cannot provide the request and suggest an
      alternate.

   o  Provide a means for "below best effort" or scavenger class data
      transmission so that traffic marked as scavenger will be carried
      in periods where no congestion is present, but may be discarded
      during periods of congestion due to either peak usage or outages.

   This solution could also be used in conjunction with defined paths
   through the network (TE, Segment Routing, etc) to provide capacity
   for traffic that has specific performance requirements, or is not
   sensitive to using a sub-optimal path. i.e. capacity exists on this
   backup path that is much longer, so since this traffic does not care
   about a few 10s of milliseconds of additional latency, it should be
   marked to use the non-optimal path even if that path is not seen as
   best by the routing protocol.

2.2.3.  User Benefit

   Key user benefits include:

   o  Best service for real-time and other interactive applications
      (less interference from non real-time or non-interactive traffic)

   o  More control over application bandwidth usage, potential for
      service guarantees for important applications

2.2.4.  Operator Benefit

   Reduced cost via better/more efficient management of capacity/growth
   while still providing first-class service to customers.

2.2.5.  Application Benefit

2.2.6.  Flow characteristics provided by application

   An application signals one or more of the following to the network:

   o  level of service required (e.g. guaranteed service, best-effort,
      or below best effort)

   o  minimum requirement for transmission rate/throughput

   o  that it is tolerant/intolerant of high latency, high jitter, high
      packet loss

   o  a request in the form "I need to deliver this data by X, when
      should I send, and how should I identify the flow?"

2.2.7.  Action taken by network as result of receiving flow
        characteristics

   Potential action taken by the network include:

   o  Identify path through network that meets flow service requirements

   o  Treat marked traffic according to identified service type (e.g.
      scavenger class carried in periods of low usage, and/or dropped
      during congestion)

2.2.8.  Feedback provided by network

   Feedback provided by the network includes:

   o  Peak demand times, either proactively (e.g. this network peaks
      daily between the hours of X and Y) or reactively through
      something like Explicit Congestion Notification (this network is
      at peak or is experiencing congestion right now)

   o  ACK/NACK for requested level of service, throughput, etc.

2.2.9.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   This requires a trust model between application and network so that
   the information communicated about performance envelope requirements
   can be trusted.  In the case where there are different costs,
   charging rates, tonnage limits by type of traffic, there is
   opportunity for abuse (maliciously marking all traffic such that it
   incurs additional cost, or such that it is dropped when it should not
   be, etc).  Even simpler data such as IP Precedence is often remarked
   at the boundaries between networks as untrusted, so carrying this
   sort of metadata likely requires a method to ensure that it was set
   by a trusted entity and not manipulated in transit.

2.3.  Video Adaptation: Use client metadata to help video bit rate
      selection

   HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) is an umbrella term for various HTTP-
   based streaming technologies that allow a client to adaptively switch
   between multiple bitrates, depending on current network conditions.
   HAS client first requests and receives a Manifest File, and then,
   after parsing the information in the Manifest File, proceeds with
   sequentially requesting the chunks listed in the Manifest File.

Internet-Draft            AEON/CONET Use Cases                  May 2014


2.3.1.  Description of Problem

   The problems with HAS are:

   o  HAS client selects the initial bitrate without knowing the current
      network conditions which could cause start-up delay and frame
      freezes while a lower bitrate chunk is being retrieved.  HAS
      client does not have a mechanism to signal the flow
      characteristics and flow priority to the network.

   o  HAS server can mark the packets appropriately but setting DSCP has
      limitations.  DSCP value may not be preserved or honored over the
      Internet and OS may not allow to set DSCP values.

   o  Content Providers may have agreements with ISPs and need a
      mechanism to convey the flow characteristics and flow priority to
      the ISP.  Existing mechanisms and the associated limitations are:

      1.  ISP can be configured with the IP addresses of content
          providers to prioritize the traffic originating from those
          servers.  The limitations with this approach are ISP has to
          keep track of content providers IP addresses.  With CDNI
          (Content Delivery Network InterConnection) content could be
          served either from uCDN (upstream CDN) or any of a number of
          dCDNs (downstream CDN) and it will not be possible to manually
          track the IP addresses of all the CDN surrogates.  There is
          also no way to differentiate content which could be available
          in different bitrates.

      2.  If HAS client is behind NAT and content provider uses RESTful
          API (OneAPI) to install differentiated QoS then ISP will
          struggle to find the pre-NAT information.  Content provider
          also needs to be aware of the ISP to which the client is
          attached and the IP address of the Policy Decision Point (PDP)
          in the ISP to which it needs to signal the flow
          characteristics.

   o  ISP can use DPI to prioritize one-way video streaming content but
      is expensive and fails if the traffic is encrypted.

2.3.2.  Proposed Solution

   If ISP has agreement with content provider then HAS client can use
   third party authorization to request network resources.  At a high
   level, this authorization works by the client first obtaining a
   cryptographic token from the authorizing network element, then
   including that token in the request along with relevant flow
   characteristics.  ISP validates the token and grants the request.

2.3.3.  User Benefit

   AEON helps increase the average play quality, reduces the start-up
   delay and frame freezes by avoiding attempt to retrieve a too high-
   bit rate chunk etc thus improving the quality of experience for end
   user.

2.3.4.  Operator Benefit

   Network Operators can recognize and prioritize one-way video
   streaming content.

2.3.5.  Application Benefit

2.3.6.  Flow characteristics provided by application

   HAS client signals the flow characteristics such as the anticipated
   bandwidth needs as well as the tolerance to delay, loss, and jitter.

2.3.7.  Action taken by network as result of receiving flow
        characteristics

   Subject to local policies, a network node might perform bandwidth
   counting, or reconfigure the underlying network so that additional
   bandwidth is made available for this particular flow, or might
   perform other actions.

2.3.8.  Feedback provided by network

   The network responds that the client request can be fully or
   partially accommodated.  It also notifies the client when conditions
   change.

2.4.  Multi-interface selection: Use metadata to help interface
      selection or prioritization

2.4.1.  Description of Problem

   An increasing number of hosts are operating in multiple-interface
   environments and a host with multiple interfaces needs to choose the
   best interface for communication.  Oftentimes, this decision is based
   on a static configuration and does not consider the link
   characteristics of that interface, which may affect the user
   experience.  The network interfaces may have different link
   characteristics, but that will not be known without the awareness of
   the upstream and downstream characteristics of the access link.

2.4.2.  Proposed Solution

   TODO

2.4.3.  User Benefit

   Applications can choose the best interface for communication using
   AEON.

2.4.4.  Operator Benefit

   The network that can provide the requested flow characteristics will
   be selected by the application thus increasing the subscriber base of
   the operator.

2.4.5.  Application Benefit

2.4.6.  Flow characteristics provided by application

   Application signals flow characteristics over multiple interfaces and
   based on the response from its various interfaces sorts the source
   addresses according to the link capacity characteristics.  Source
   addresses from the interface which best fulfills the desired flow
   characteristics are assigned the highest priority and would be tried
   first to communicate with the server or remote peer.  For example
   draft-reddy-mmusic-ice-best-interface-pcp-00 explains the mechanism
   where Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) agent on a host
   with multiple interfaces uses AEON to determine the link
   characteristics of the host's interfaces, which influences the ICE
   candidate priority.  Similarly draft-wing-mptcp-pcp-00 explains how
   Multipath TCP (MPTCP) can select the best path when multiple paths
   are available.

2.5.  Session Identification: Identification of multiple media flows
      belonging to a common application session

2.5.1.  Description of Problem

   Many end-to-end application sessions involve multiple application
   protocols, devices and administrative domains.  These sessions
   involve multiple media flows (e.g. an audio flow and a video flow for



George, et al.          Expires November 30, 2014              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft            AEON/CONET Use Cases                  May 2014


   a video call, media flows between different entities in a
   supplementary service session consisting of multiple SIP dialogs or
   H.323 calls).  Media flows may be added/removed from a application
   session during the lifetime of the session.  From within the network,
   determining which media flows are associated with each application
   session is often difficult, making it hard to provide application
   level troubleshooting, traffic analysis, and QoS.

2.5.2.  Proposed Solution

   Including a session identifier (e.g. as defined in RFC 7206) in the
   flow characteristics communicated by the application to the network
   would allow the network to identify media flows belonging to a common
   application session.  This visibility would enable the following:

   o  network troubleshooting and traffic analysis tools to correctly
      associate media flows with application sessions

   o  media flows that are part of established application sessions to
      be identified (e.g. the triggered call in the case of a transfer)
      and given dedicated QoS.  Preserving established sessions
      generally is higher priority than setting up new sessions (except
      when there is some form of multi-level preemption).  Giving more
      bandwidth to additional flows on established sessions might cause
      some newer sessions to fail due to resource unavailability while
      established sessions continue without degradation, which is the
      preferred outcome in most cases.

2.5.3.  User Benefit

   Users receive more predictable and reliable QoS for their application
   sessions.

2.5.4.  Operator Benefit

   Operators are able to perform traffic analysis and troubleshooting at
   the application level, and they are able to provide QoS at the
   application level rather than only at the media flow level.

2.5.5.  Application Benefit

2.5.6.  Flow characteristics provided by application

   The application provides a common session id as metadata for all its
   media flows throughout the lifetime of the session.

2.5.7.  Action taken by network as result of receiving flow
        characteristics

   The network identifies all media flows associated with a given
   session.  This information may be used to provide application level
   QoS, preserving established sessions and/or giving more bandwidth to
   additional flows on established sessions.

2.5.8.  Feedback provided by network

   The network may provide feedback to the application indicating the
   amount of bandwidth it expects to be able to provide for its session.
   It may also be provide indications of the expected amount of delay,
   jitter, and loss the application should be prepared to tolerate.

2.5.9.  Security and Privacy Considerations

2.6.  Content Based Charging

2.6.1.  Description of Problem

   Commonly used billing method for internet subscribers, e.g. volume
   based charging, does not distinguish usage from the angle of
   applications.  Under this billing model ISP cannot apply different
   pricing strategies to the applications it carries, users may hesitate
   to use certain types of applications, e.g. mobile apps consuming
   large volume, and application developers also have to strive for
   volume apart from user preference and usage time.  Content based
   charging is an emerging billing method that takes content related
   information into account and enables smarter pricing strategy.
   Operators can place different prices for different types of traffic,
   and help content providers build tight relationship with their users,
   e.g. wholesaling the data volume of an application to its developer
   content provider so that users can use the application free of
   charge.  Content based charging is required to precisely identify
   traffic that belongs to a certain pricing category in a way that is
   flexible and easy to manage, and granularity of traffic may range
   from types of applications to a detailed service function within an
   application.  Those requirements reflex limitations in the current
   heuristics.

2.6.2.  Proposed Solution

   In order to address this problem a mechanism is needed to allow
   applications to notify its existence to the network by describing
   traffic flows needing a certain charging method.  Network will then
   have direct visibility into the traffic and identify targeted traffic
   accordingly.  This billing model usually involves collaboration



George, et al.          Expires November 30, 2014              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft            AEON/CONET Use Cases                  May 2014


   between network and content providers.  The notification needs to go
   through an authentication function to guarantee the application is
   reliable and probably an identifier for network to identify the
   application that has service agreement with ISP.  ISP will identify
   traffic based on characteristics notified by application and apply
   designated billing strategy.

2.6.3.  User Benefit

   Users take advantage of the granular and customized charging model,
   and pay for different types of traffic at different rate.  This
   charging model will reduce volume expense for users and stimulate
   internet usage.

2.6.4.  Operator Benefit

   The solution will provide operators with a method to precisely
   identify and charge traffic based on content, and to agilely manage
   charging strategy of applications.  Operators are able to cooperate
   with content providers to provide this new billing service to users
   and encourage encourage traffic consumption.

2.6.5.  Application Benefit

   Content provider can benefit from providing users with exclusive
   payment function, e.g. pay for traffic volume or provide cheap volume
   package, and increase user enthusiasm and time to use its
   applications.

2.6.6.  Flow characteristics provided by application

   Application notifies network of its identifier and traffic
   description to enable network to recognize its traffic accordingly.
   Application may also signal its intended charging model as a request
   to the network.

2.6.7.  Action taken by network as result of receiving flow
        characteristics

   Network identifies traffic flows notified by the application and
   applies the designated billing model based on application request and
   business agreement with the content provider providing the
   application.

2.6.8.  Feedback provided by network

2.6.9.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   There needs to be an authentication mechanism so as to ensure that
   traffic characteristics provider is right the authorized application
   the ISP has the charging agreement with.

2.7.  Open QoS and Experience Enhancement for Applications

2.7.1.  Description of Problem

   Current QoS provided in an ISP's network is usually circuit or user
   based, achieved by configuring policies on network nodes like edge
   router or gateway, and is not dynamic, on-demand or application
   specific.  An example showing the current problem of achieving
   application granularity is the internet based home products provided
   by many content providers, e.g. an internet TV box using WiFi to
   connect the internet and providing video programs to users.  Content
   providers often wish to cooperate with the ISP providing internet
   access service to improve the experience of their services, as access
   network is often congested due to extensive internet usage nowadays.
   But currently there is no direct way of classifying certain traffic
   when it is mixed with other background traffic in a single pipe, e.g.
   WiFi.  Implementing classification on specific traffic of an
   individual application, e.g. text, audio, video traffic of an instant
   messaging application, is even more difficult.

   QoS provided by an ISP is usually predefined and not application
   driven.  QoS ability opening provides a mechanism to enable dynamic
   access acceleration, priority guarantee and other service
   differentiation for ICPs, and new application based QoS selling
   business for network operators.  By opening QoS ability to content
   providers, this mechanism is expected to allow application to
   subscribe QoS business to enhance its user experience, and manage
   traffic treatment on its own.

2.7.2.  Proposed Solution

   The potential solution proposes a collaboration mechanism for content
   provider operating the application and ISP operating the network.
   Application notifies the network of its identifier and the
   characteristics of its traffic flows needing experience enhancement.
   The notification probably conveys service request to the network,
   e.g. desired QoS, capacity guarantee, etc.  The treatment traffic
   will receive is expected to be based on agreements between content
   provider and ISP, or service subscription templates provided by ISP,
   and an authentication mechanism is used by ISP to validate the party

   making the notification.  Network will then know the exact
   application information of traffic, and perform traffic
   identification and differentiation on network nodes, e.g. broadband
   access router.  This solution provides a way for applications to lead
   its experience enhancement.

2.7.3.  User Benefit

   Users will have enhanced experience when using the applications.

2.7.4.  Operator Benefit

   Operator is able to identify application traffic precisely and
   perform differentiated service accordingly.  QoS ability of operator
   is further extended to a finer granularity and initiation and
   management of traffic differentiation is more flexible and open,
   providing operator with new business model while cooperating with
   content provider.

2.7.5.  Application Benefit

   Content provider has the ability to influence the treatment network
   give to its traffic, and decide when and how to apply QoS to its
   traffic.  By enhancing experience using this mechanism user
   enthusiasm and usage time will be increased.

2.7.6.  Flow characteristics provided by application

   Application notifies network of its identifier and the
   characteristics of its traffic flows needing experience enhancement.
   Application may also notify the network of a request of desired
   traffic treatment.

2.7.7.  Action taken by network as result of receiving flow
        characteristics

   Network identifies traffic flows notified by the application and
   applies the designated QoS or other service guarantee based on
   application request and business agreement/subscription with the
   content provider providing the application.

2.7.8.  Feedback provided by network

   Network may provide feedback indicating whether service request can
   be satisfied or the designated service, but it is not mandatory.
