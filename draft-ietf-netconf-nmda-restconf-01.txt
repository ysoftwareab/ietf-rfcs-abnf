1.  Introduction

   This document updates RESTCONF [RFC8040] in order to support the
   Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].

   The solution presented in this document is backwards compatible with
   [RFC8040].  This is achieved by it only adding new top-level
   resources, and thereby leaving the semantics of all existing
   resources alone.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores] and are not redefined here:

   o  operational state datastore

   o  running configuration datastore

   o  intended configuration datastore

2.  Summary of Updates to RFC 8040

   This document updates [RFC8040] in the following ways:

   o  Adds new top-level resource "/ds".

   o  Adds new query parameter "with-origin".

   o  Section 3.5.4, Paragraph 3 in [RFC8040] doesn't apply when
      interacting with any resource under {+restconf}/ds.

   o  Updates section 10 in [RFC8040] by requiring servers that support
      NMDA to implement "ietf-yang-library" as defined in
      [I-D.nmdsdt-netconf-rfc7895bis].

3.  Conformance

   RFC Ed.: Update 201X-XX-XX below with correct date.

   An NMDA-compliant RESTCONF server MUST support the operational state
   datastore.  Such a server identifies that it supports NMDA both by
   implementing the {+restconf}/ds/ietf-datastores:operational resource,
   and by implementing at least revision 201X-XX-XX of the
   "ietf-yang-library" module, as specified in
   [I-D.nmdsdt-netconf-rfc7895bis].

   A RESTCONF client can test if a server supports the NMDA by using
   either the HEAD or GET methods on {+restconf}/ds/ietf-
   datastores:operational.

4.  The {+restconf}/ds/<datastore> Resources

   This document defines a set of new resources representing datastores
   as defined in [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].  These resources
   are available using the resource path template:

     {+restconf}/ds/<datastore>

   Where <datastore> is encoded as an "identity" according to the JSON
   encoding rules for identities, defined in Section 4 of [RFC7951].
   Such an identity MUST be derived from the "datastore" identity in
   "ietf-datastores" [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].

   Specifically:

   o  The resource {+restconf}/ds/ietf-datastores:operational refers to
      the operational state datastore.

Internet-Draft                                              October 2017


   o  The resource {+restconf}/ds/ietf-datastores:running refers to the
      running configuration datastore.

   o  The resource {+restconf}/ds/ietf-datastores:intended refers to the
      intended configuration datastore.

   An NMDA-compliant server MUST implement {+restconf}/ds/ietf-
   datastores:operational.  Other datastore resources are optional to
   implement.

   If a server implements the example datastore "ds-ephemeral" in the
   module "example-ds-ephemeral", it would implement the resource
   {+restconf}/ds/example-ds-ephemeral:ds-ephemeral.

5.  Protocol Operations

   All existing protocol operations defined in [RFC8040] for the
   {+restconf}/data resource are available for all of the new datastore
   resources with the following exceptions:

   o  Dynamic datastores are excluded, as each dynamic datastore
      definition needs to be reviewed for what protocol operations it
      supports.

   o  Some datastores are read-only by nature (e.g., <intended>), and
      hence any attempt to modify these datastores will fail.

   o  The "with-defaults" query parameter ([RFC8040], Section 4.8.9)
      does not apply when interacting with {+restconf}/ds/ietf-
      datastores:operational.  This means that all values are always
      returned from the operational state datastore, even if a node
      happens to have a default statement in the YANG module, and this
      default value is being used by the server.  If the "with-defaults"
      query parameter is present in a request to this resource, the
      server MUST return a response with a "400 Bad Request" status-
      line.  The error-tag value "invalid-value" is used in this case.

   o  [RFC8040], section 3.5.4, paragraph 3 does not apply when
      interacting with any resource under {+restconf}/ds.

5.1.  The "with-origin" query parameter

   The GET operation adds a new query parameter named "with-origin",
   which if present, requests that the server includes "origin" metadata
   anotations in its response, as detailed in the NMDA.  This parameter
   is only valid when querying {+restconf}/ds/ietf-
   datastores:operational or any datastores with identities derived from
   the "operational" identity.  Otherwise, if an invalid datastore is

   specified then the server MUST return a response witha a "400 Bad
   Request" status-line, using an error-tag value of "invalid-value".
   "origin" metadata annotations are not included unless a client
   explicitly requests them.

   Data from <operational> can come from multiple sources.  The server
   should return the most accurate value for the "origin" metadata
   annotation as possible, indicating the source of the operational
   value, as specified in section 5.3.4 of the NMDA.

   When encoding the origin metadata annotation for a hierarchy of
   returned nodes, the annotation may be omitted for a child node when
   the value matches that of the parent node (as described in ietf-
   origin@2017-08-17).  [RFC Editor, please check published revision
   date.]

   The "with-origin" query parameter is optional to support.  It is
   identified with the URI:

     urn:ietf:params:restconf:capability:with-origin:1.0

6.  Security Considerations

   TBD

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines one capability in the "RESTCONF Capability
   URNs" registry defined in [RFC8040]:

     Index          Capability Identifier
     ------------------------------------------------------------------

     :with-origin   urn:ietf:params:restconf:capability:with-origin:1.0
