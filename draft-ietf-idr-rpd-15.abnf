M-Type = 0:  Exact match with the Mask length IP address prefix.
         GeMask and LeMask MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.

M-Type = 1:  Matches if the Mask number of prefix bits exactly
         match between IPaddress and IProute and the actual prefix
         length of IProute is greater than or equal to GeMask.  LeMask
         MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.

M-Type = 2:  Matches if the Mask number of prefix bits exactly
         match between IPaddress and IProute and the actual prefix
         length of IProute is less than or equal to LeMask.  GeMask MUST
         be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.

M-Type = 3:  Matches if the Mask number of prefix bits exactly
         match between IPaddress and IProute and the actual prefix
         length of IProute is less than or equal to LeMask and greater
         than or equal to GeMask.

LeMask = 0> represents match IP prefix 16.1.0.0/24 greater-equal 24
LeMask = 26> represents match IP prefix 17.1.0.0/24 less-equal 26
LeMask = 30> represents match IP prefix 18.1.0.0/24 greater-equal 24
OP = 0:  assign the Value to the existing MED.

OP = 1:  add the Value to the existing MED.  If the sum is greater
         than the maximum value for MED, assign the maximum value to
         MED.

OP = 2:  subtract the Value from the existing MED.  If the
         existing MED minus the Value is less than 0, assign 0 to MED.
