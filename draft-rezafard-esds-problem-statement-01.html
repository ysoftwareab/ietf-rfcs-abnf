<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>   This document discusses the requirements of an application layer
protocol which can meet the needs of today's complex and dynamic supply
chains.  Currently, supply chain communication traffic travels over the
Internet using existing Internet protocols, such as FTP, SMTP, and DNS.
This is a temporary solution for a growing niche.  This document
elaborates on issues that would arise if this trend continues.  Also,
this document outlines a set of design concerns that an application
layer protocol needs to address in order to be deployable in a
real-world supply chain.
</p>
<p>This document obsoletes "Extensible Supply-chain Discovery Service
Problem Statement draft-rezafard-esds-problem-statement-00".
</p>
<p>Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the mailing list at
esds@ietf.org and/or the author(s).

<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Introduction</h3>

<p>Currently, a number of industry sectors are moving towards improved
track and trace systems by the use of Auto-ID technologies (such as
Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)) that improve the ability to
automate collection of observations, as well as the use of unique
identifiers for each individual object, to improve the granularity of
information, so that it is possible to track not only at the granularity
of batches or lots - but actually trace the entire life history of an
individual object.  This is particularly important in the fight against
counterfeiting and for assuring the traceability and authenticity of
foods, pharmaceuticals and other safety-critical objects, such as
aircraft and automotive parts.
</p>
<p>As well as automating the collection of such data, companies are also
moving towards sharing and exchange of serial-level data, in order to
improve the efficiency of supply chains.  This involves greater use of
machine-to-machine information exchange, using standard interfaces for
queries and output formats and requiring less intervention by human
operators (e.g. exchanging spreadsheets via e-mail or FTP).  However,
serial-level data is commercially sensitive, since it can reveal
information about stock levels and volumes and flows of goods.  For this
reason, most companies insist on maintaining strict control over who is
granted access to their data.  The entire lifecycle information for an
individual object therefore remains decentralized and fragmented across
multiple actors in the supply chain or extended product lifecycle.
Discovery Services will provide secure referral services that can be
queried with a unique ID and return to authenticated authorized clients
a list of links to multiple information providers, who can then be
queried for more detailed information about the individual object.
</p>
<p>At a conceptual level, Discovery Services can be superficially
regarded as being somewhat analogous to a 'search engine' for an
'internet of things'.  However, there are some fundamental differences
from the paradigm of public web search engines.  The serial-level
information will usually be protected and will only be made available to
authorized partners, with whom the information provider has an
established trust relationship.  For this reason, we cannot assume that
Discovery Services will be able to automatically 'spider' or 'crawl' the
network to compile an index of links, since the underlying information
may not be generally available.
</p>
<p>Instead, we assume that each information provider will be able to
voluntarily publish an event or record for a particular unique ID, in
order that a link can be established back to them as a potential
provider of information.  At the same time, also the 'link' information
will be protected by access control policies defined by each information
provider, as well as any policies which are imposed by the operator of a
Discovery Service.  Unlike most public search engines, there may be
little or no 'link' information provided to non-authenticated users or
directly to the general public without authentication, although citizens
may be provided access to traceability information via an authorized
authenticated actor, such as the retailer or manufacturer.
</p>
<p>This approach enables distributed management of lifecycle data and
allows each organization to restrict who can access the data; they can
specify an access control policy (which is enforced by a Discovery
Service) to limit visibility of the 'link' information - and
additionally, they can specify and enforce an access control policy
within their own information service that holds the more detailed event
data.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
Background</h3>

<p>   Traditionally supply chain communication has been routed over
private network infrastructures.  However in recent years this practice
is abandoned in favour of communication over public networks.  The
communication and data exchange has taken the form of flat file data
exchange, XML, and other proprietary forms across existing mechanisms,
such as SFTP and SMTP.  This method of exchange requires bilateral
agreements and networking arrangements amongst all partners of a given
supply chain.  In this model, information sharing begins with the supply
chain partner who provides lists of the objects (shipping manifest) that
the other partners can expect to receive and exchange within the supply
chain.  While this one way method is effective in very static supply
chain relationships, its main drawback lies in its inability to support
dynamic routing of physical objects and, therefore, exception handling.
For example, if an object arrived at supply chain partner C without
prior notification from supply chain partner B or A, the product remains
unidentified and not routable.
</p>
<p>   The advent of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags has been
a catalyst for the desire to reverse-lookup object information.
Products are being tagged with RFID tags, traditional barcodes, and
other types of proprietary object identifiers.  The exchange of
information now begins with the object and leads back to the supply
chain partner.  As the object is scanned at various key locations in the
supply chain, a referral service must be available to match the object's
identifier either to a relevant supply chain partner or to a list of
relevant supply chain partners and the data services that these partners
offer to a requestor.  This enables supply chains to route flexibly and
handle exceptions.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
Terminology</h3>

<p>There are three actors in this problem: 
</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Client:</dt>
<dd>refers to an actor that seeks (sources of)
information about an individual object.
</dd>
<dt>Resource:</dt>
<dd>refers to an actor that holds information about
an individual object and may provide it to authenticated clients who
satisfy some authorization criteria (access control policies and
rules).
</dd>
<dt>ESDS:</dt>
<dd>refers to an intermediary lookup service that
enables a client to locate one or more resources.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>

</p>
<p>What emerges from combinations of these actors and their relationships are:

</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Partner:</dt>
<dd>refers to a business entity 
which is comprised of Client and Resource actors belonging to an 
organization.
 
</dd>
<dt>Supply chain:</dt>
<dd>refers to a group of partners that 
have the desire to share information among themselves.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>

<a name="rfc.section.1.3"></a><h3>1.3.&nbsp;
Problem Statement</h3>

<p>   Information sharing between partners is essential for all modern
supply chain networks.  There is a strict set of business and technical
requirements that must be observed in order to enable open sharing of
information in a supply chain.
</p>
<p>   There are resources and clients in each supply chain.  Each
resource wants to advertise its knowledge (data) to interested and
authorized clients.  Only deploying private networks to connect whole
supply chains is no longer feasible, as the more efficient and
economical means of connecting resources and clients is to use public
network infrastructure.  Currently, many supply chain track-and-trace
initiatives are deployed on public networks and the information is
routed through the Internet.  Because of this trend, it is highly
desirable that a draft protocol should be developed.  An IETF process
consensus would ensure that the adopted protocol conforms to the
Internet's operational needs.
</p>
<p>   A key principle of information sharing in the supply chain is that
data ownership must be respected.  This means that each partner can
collect information within their organization and is not required to
route that information to any other partner.  However, they can choose
to share selected information with other trusted partners.  This in turn
means that the complete lifecycle information about any individual
object may be held by multiple resources throughout the supply chain or
the product lifecycle.  Therefore a mechanism is needed in order to
facilitate the gathering of this information.
</p>
<p> A key requirement is that information accessibility is fully
controllable.  The confidential information must be secure and hidden
from unauthorized clients and only visible to the intended clients in
a supply chain.  In order to establish trust and reputation with the
participating resources, unauthorized clients need to be barred from
viewing, eavesdropping, or deducing information.
</p>
<p>    There must be a common set of data that all resources will offer
(only to authorized clients).  This set must be defined and agreed upon
in the final protocol.  This set may include answers to who, what, when,
where, and why as well as links to back-end systems.  An essential
feature is for the protocol to be extensible beyond the common data set
to facilitate the needs of supply chains that discover additional
uses.
</p>
<p>   Defining a bootstrapping procedure is a necessity when designing a
global and autonomous network of systems.  Currently there are deployed
supply chain systems that bootstrap via Internet's DNS roots.  One
example of this is the EPCglobal Object Name Service <a class='info' href='#epc-object-naming-services'>[epc&#8209;object&#8209;naming&#8209;services]<span> (</span><span class='info'>EPCglobal, &ldquo;Object Naming Service 1.0,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> (ONS).  While ONS enables an
economical means of bootstrapping, improper implementations may increase
the traffic on DNS roots exponentially.  Since data will be routed
through the Internet, the bootstrapping procedure needs to be formulated
under the IETF approval process.

Description</h3>

<p>   An Extensible Supply-chain Discovery Service (ESDS) provides a
mechanism to locate one or more sources of information about an
individual physical object.  This may include the original manufacturer
or supplier of the object, as well as other organizations who have
handled the object at some point during its lifecycle (including repair
and maintenance organizations) and even organizations (such as customs
or insurance agencies) who might hold information records related to the
object, even though they may have never had physical custody of the
object.
</p>
<p>   This document defines the Problem Statement, Objectives and
Technical Challenges related to the application layer protocol currently
proposed as Extensible Supply-chain Discovery Services (ESDS).  ESDS
enables the publishing and querying of referral links to information
services that historical events related to specific objects with
attached object identifiers.  The interface enables disparate
applications to track-and-trace shared lifecycle views of object
identifiers across a supply chain.  Primarily, ESDS provides referral
services in a loosely coupled mechanism with granular security that
enables selective visibility.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Public Networks and Tree-Walking Concerns</h3>

<p>   Currently, another standards body, EPCglobal, has issued a related
standard referred to as ONS <a class='info' href='#epc-object-naming-services'>[epc&#8209;object&#8209;naming&#8209;services]<span> (</span><span class='info'>EPCglobal, &ldquo;Object Naming Service 1.0,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.
ONS is effectively an extended version of DNS that does not benefit from
the IETF review process and, in its design, necessitates increased tree-
walking.  ONS specifies a reverse mapping of the EPCglobal "SGTIN" (one
type of supply chain object identifier) as a hostname and allows for a
reference (i.e.  URL) to a manufacturer's relevant back-end system
(using a NAPTR record).  The SGTIN identifier is comprised of an EPC
Manager Number, an Object Class, and a Serial Number.  The ONS lookup
excludes the Serial Number portion of the SGTIN.  However, the ONS
specification has already been extended in industry pilot projects to
include the Serial Number, as this enables item level lookups for tagged
objects in the supply chain.  Using serial level lookups, ONS could be
used to indicate point to point referrals through the passage of a
relevant identifier throughout the supply chain.  This would require
successive updates to the hierarchal ONS to indicate incremental supply
chain partner referrals, reducing the effectiveness of caching.
Alternatively the ONS could provide a single, static point of referral
to the first or initiating supply chain partner.  However, even a
relatively static entry, which only refers to the point of origin within
the supply chain, would drive the number of public zone entries to
extremely large numbers if an individual record were created for each
serial number.  The number of records could exceed the current IPv4
address space by several orders of magnitude.  Also since many of the
tagged physical objects would neither require nor provide network
connectivity, utilizing IPv6 for such objects would waste this finite
address space resource unnecessarily. 
</p>
<p>   One common suggestion to manage this problem is to have multiple
alternate ONS roots which can be managed for separate and unrelated
supply chains and/or regions.  However, since there is nothing to
prevent ONS from operating in the existing Internet root hierarchy, even
alternate ONS providers can opt to drive traffic to the existing
Internet root servers, rather than operate their own ONS roots.  There
has already been a pilot ONS implementation under the .aero zone
(sgtin.id.ons.autoid.aero) where this phenomenon may already be
observed.  
</p>
<p>It should be noted that ONS 1.0 <a class='info' href='#epc-object-naming-services'>[epc&#8209;object&#8209;naming&#8209;services]<span> (</span><span class='info'>EPCglobal, &ldquo;Object Naming Service 1.0,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> currently only specifies how to
perform a lookup for a GTIN class identifier, which represents a product
type.  It does not currently specify that ONS should be used for lookup
of fully serialized identifiers.  While the number of GTIN codes may be
a manageable number, the potential number of serialized SGTIN
identifiers is much larger.  Already in EPCglobal Tag Data Standards,
the structure of SGTIN identifiers are defined such that it is
theoretically possible to create in excess of 10^38 unique SGTIN
identifiers for each GTIN code that is currently resolvable using ONS
1.0.  Already there are some companies who create over a billion objects
per year for a single GTIN class.
</p>
<p>It was therefore a very wise decision of EPCglobal not to propose
that ONS 1.0 should store a DNS record for each unique EPC, since the
number of resulting DNS records could clearly overwhelm the DNS
infrastructure.  
</p>
<p>However, there is currently a missing element in the EPCglobal
Network architecture, namely a search service that provides authorized
authenticated clients with links to the multiple organizations who hold
information about the unique life history of an individual object.  This
missing element is essential for enabling robust track and trace
applications.  Because this element ('Discovery Services') has not yet
been defined, there is a danger that some organizations may misuse the
ONS design  and begin creating DNS records for each fully serialized
object.   There is already one industry pilot where this is happening.
It is therefore essential that rapid progress should be made towards a
protocol for Discovery Services that avoids placing such a burden on the
DNS infrastructure.
</p>
<p>To summarize, there are two variances to the ONS specifications that
can be observed in current deployments. The first variance is an
extension to the ONS structure to include serialized level data
(serialized SGTIN) instead of just the specified class data (GTIN
class). The second variance involves the tendency of the implementers to
utilize the existing Internet root DNS servers instead of operating
alternate ONS roots. These variances could adversely affect the
stability of the public network infrastructure. The  IESG and IAB
overview procedures at the IETF will ensure that the protocol and
architecture proposed by the ESDS Work Group will be mindful of such
deviations and take counter steps to prevent it.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
Bootstrapping Concerns</h3>

<p>   Currently there are discussions on how to best facilitate a
bootstrapping processes for objects in the supply chain.  The
bootstrapping process enables an interested and authorized client to
locate an object's Discovery Service server using only the information
provided by the object identifier.  Unlike DNS, where there is a known
set of root servers, ESDS will have numerous roots for various supply
chains operating globally.  This, in turn, complicates the bootstrapping
process. 
</p>
<p>   A common bootstrapping scenario is exception handling.  For
example, if an object is mis-delivered, a recipient who has no
pre-existing relationship to the supply chain, needs to obtain object
ownership information and its corresponding Discovery Service server.
ESDS design must aim to accommodate this scenario while respecting
privacy and security considerations.
</p>
<p>   It has been suggested that ONS could be used for the bootstrapping
process.  However, ONS's hierarchical identifiers have raised privacy
and security concerns by multiple participants in the supply chain.
While ONS can technically support multiple identifier schemes, with
multiple issuing authorities, its hierarchical operation does depend on
structured identifiers (for example,
ManagerNumber.ObjectType.SerialNumber).  These identifiers display
information about products such as type and manufacturer and as a result
could compromise the privacy of an individual carrying them, as well as
the security of transportation within supply chains.  Additionally, ONS
has no authentication nor access control restricting who can query it.
ESDS must be designed for serial level lookups and must support
unstructured opaque identifiers to use as lookup keys within an ESDS
service.  Because serial-level lookup information could potentially be
subject to data mining by competitors, to reveal information about
volumes and flows of goods, ESDS should fully support authentication and
serial level access controls to address concerns about privacy and
confidentiality of data.
</p>
<p>   To facilitate bootstrapping and exception handling scenarios ESDS
design could investigate the use of peer-to-peer lookup protocols (such
as JXTA <a class='info' href='#jxta-protocols'>[jxta&#8209;protocols]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Duigou, M., &ldquo;JXTA v2.0 Protocols Specification,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>) as an alternative to
hierarchical lookup protocols such as DNS and ONS. This would keep the
ESDS traffic flat and avoid walking up the Internet root hierarchy.  A
major concern is that the bootstrapping design must not implicitly
establish monopolies in the long run.  The IETF process will ensure that
the resulting protocol design addresses the concerns of all participants
in the global supply chain.

Other Standards</h3>

<p>   Discovery Services addresses a problem domain that is not covered
by any existing protocols.  Discovery Services enables authorized and
authenticated users, to gather and retrieve links to all providers of
lifecycle information about an object, this information is typically
fragmented across the whole supply chain. While there are related

Object Naming Service (ONS)</h3>

<p>   ONS is a mechanism that leverages the Domain Name System (DNS) to
locate sources of authoritative information and related services about a
product when queried using a hostname derived from the Electronic
Product Code (EPC).  Its query interface as currently defined lacks
access controls, authorization and authentication and this security
deficiency makes it unsuitable for a Discovery Service handling
commercially-sensitive serial-level information.  The volumes of
serial-level records generated by the supply chains would place an
unreasonable burden on the DNS roots if ONS were mis-used for holding
ONS records for each serial number.  However, Discovery Service can be
used in collaboration with ONS to meet specific business
requirements. <a class='info' href='#epc-object-naming-services'>[epc&#8209;object&#8209;naming&#8209;services]<span> (</span><span class='info'>EPCglobal, &ldquo;Object Naming Service 1.0,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>

EPC Information Services (EPCIS)</h3>

query interface to allow trusted partners to retrieve some of its data.
It is not the role of EPCIS to enable robust linking to information
across the entire supply chain or product lifecycle, nor to perform
recursive 'proxy queries' to retrieve data from other parties, nor to
facilitate exception handling and object bootstrapping across the whole
supply chain. <a class='info' href='#epc-information-services'>[epc&#8209;information&#8209;services]<span> (</span><span class='info'>EPCglobal Information Services Work Group, &ldquo;EPCglobal Information Services,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>

Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI)</h3>

concerned with locating services that provide information about a
specific physical object; the ID of a physical object is the primary
lookup key for ESDS, whereas UDDI is primarily queried for a particular
type of service functionality desired.  Unlike UDDI registries, the data
held within ESDS may be much more commercially sensitive because it
could reveal volumes and flows of goods in supply chains; from a
security and scalability perspective, ESDS therefore attempts to solve a
more challenging problem than the problem that UDDI already solves.

Related Standards Development Organizations</h3>

<p>   Discovery Services is an interesting problem with significant
challenges for both end-users and service providers.  To tackle these
challenges, the problem must be approached from both viewpoints, to
ensure that the final adopted solution meets the needs of all
organizations involved.
</p>
<p>   The EPCglobal Data Discovery Joint Requirements Group (JRG) is in
the process of gathering use cases and user requirements in order to
define a Discovery Services standard which can meet the needs of supply
chain participants and end-users.  In a parallel and complementary
effort, ESDS is addressing the technical challenges of Discovery
Services, such as its deployment on public network infrastructures.  The
final goal is to share the lessons learned in a co-operative effort to
forge a single standard protocol.
</p>
<p>   ESDS is chartered to produce draft proposals for the Discovery
Service protocol. Similar to the manner in which the ONS standard
adopted the approach and architecture developed by the IETF DNS Work
Group, it is the intention of the ESDS activity that any draft protocols
developed will be useful to EPCglobal and will help to accelerate the
development of an EPCglobal standard for Discovery Services.

Security</h3>

<p>   Since ESDS needs to be deployable over a public network
infrastructure, issues of security and privacy are of heightened
importance.  Clients must be authenticated to prevent theft of
information and resources must be authenticated to ensure integrity of
information.  The information routed over the Internet must be
encrypted.  It is suggested that the security model should be based on
open standards, trusted by the supply chain industry.
</p>
<p>   The ESDS protocol should be decoupled from the security layer and
not have embedded components specific to certain security protocol
implementations.  This will enable ESDS implementations to respond
quickly to changes in the ever advancing security layer protocols.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.1"></a><h3>5.1.1.&nbsp;
Access Control</h3>

<p>   An ESDS should provide a resource with the ability to protect its
link information in order to retain control over which clients are
allowed to read this information.  Such rules may be expressed in the
form of access control policies which are evaluated against the client's
authentication credentials and its role in relation to the provider of
the resource, as well as other criteria such as the time elapsed since
the link was created.
</p>
<p>   ESDS needs to define the granularity of information at which
access control policies are specified and enforced. Whether they apply
to individual events as atomic indivisible entities, or they can specify
which data fields to include or omit.
</p>
<p>   A situation may arise where a client and the provider of a
resource have no existing trust relationship with each other.  An ESDS
should allow a resource to specify multiple levels of 'visibility' to
such a client, so that the resource either remains completely 'silent'
or 'invisible', or so that an opaque handle is visible.  The opaque
handle should not reveal the identity of the resource in any way, but
can be used to facilitate the initial negotiation between a client and a
resource, such as forwarding a number of messages from the client to the
provider of the resource, provided that the client specifies the handle
in their message, and provided that an ESDS or associated service
incorporates such a mechanism.  To protect the resource provider and
ESDS from additional burden, such a facility may be limited in the
number of messages which are forwarded and the time window following the
client's query during which forwarding of messages is offered.
</p>
<p>   It is recommended that ESDS follows existing standards for
defining access control policies, such as XACML.  ESDS should wait for
the BRIDGE project work package 4 (Security) on recommendations for
access control interface and protocols.

Independence</h3>

<p>   In today's morphing supply chains there will always be resources
that cannot or will not participate in track-and-trace efforts.  If a
resource in a supply chain chooses not to participate, the protocol
architecture needs to be tolerant of this missing link in the supply
chain.  The only acceptable consequence of a non-participating resource
would be to miss the information that would have been supplied had it
participated.
</p>
<p>   One of the problems with relying on 'following the chain' from the
manufacturer to the current downstream custodian of the object is that
there could be a broken link in the chain if one of the organizations
does not provide an onward link - or if their information service is
temporarily (or permanently) unavailable.  A Discovery Service should
provide some resilience to ensure that, it is always possible to
'navigate beyond a broken link' to find who currently has the
object.

Publish</h3>

<p>   An ESDS must provide a mechanism whereby a resource can
dynamically establish a link for an individual object (or list or range
or class of objects) that points from the ESDS to the resource.  The
link can be expressed as a string or URI and it is helpful if this is
accompanied by an indication of the type of service which can be
accessed via the link (in order to distinguish between web pages, web
services, EPC Information Services (EPCIS) and other communication
mechanisms which might even include phone or fax numbers).

Query</h3>

<p>   An ESDS should provide a mechanism whereby a client can query the
ESDS in order to retrieve a list of links to one or more resources.
Queries may be one-time queries or standing queries, and an ESDS may
support either type of query, or both.
</p>
<p>The query interface needs to define the criteria fields as well as
acceptable criteria values, such as regular expressions or
wildcards.
</p>
<p>The ESDS Work Group should decide on whether to support multilayer
information visibility.  A query with limited access can be informed of
the existence of information for a particular object, but to view the
actual information, full access privileges would be required.  This has
particular implications for peer-to-peer searching across multiple
Discovery Services.  Another scenario to consider is whether visibility
into the information in the extended fields of a published event, should
be controlled independently of event information?  (i.e. should access
control policies be sufficiently expressive that they can grant or deny
access to individual data fields within events, rather than simply
granting or denying access to events) This has particular implications
for tracking aggregation and disaggregation events and visibility into
the entire lifecycle of an object.

Relabel/Aggregation/Disaggregation</h3>

<p>   To provide complete and resilient visibility across the entire
life of a product, it is required that events involving object
identifier changes can be held in the Discovery Service layer.
</p>
<p>   One scenario requiring the capture of aggregation and
decomposition events is the regulation of the European parliament with
respect to the cold supply chain regarding the tracking of fresh meat.
For example, as a cow moves from a farm into the supply chain where it
is finally sold as beef to a consumer at a retail store, it is vital
that relabelling and disaggregation events can be stored within a
Discovery Service in order to enable querying information about the
entire lifecycle of the cow "from farm to fork" While having access
control over visibility of these kind of events is desired, it is
recommended that Discovery Services should not attempt to interpret or
validate these events.  It has been suggested that these complexities be
excluded from the core of ESDS, instead facilitating them via the
extensions mechanism and/or leaving such interpretation, validation and
analysis to client applications that query ESDS.  This approach must
also give consideration to providing access control to the extension
information.

Lifecycle</h3>

<p>   As an object moves through the supply chain, it produces events of
interest.  The same event on the same object may take on a different
meaning depending on the lifecycle step of the object.  These events
would be more useful to the interested partners if they conveyed some
information about the lifecycle step of the object being tracked.
Lifecycle step definitions and transitions can be different across
various industry sectors. The lifecycle step could convey information
about the state of an object in the supply chain. The lifecycle defined
by a supply chain could enable intelligent interpretation and validation
of events by a partner's Business Application.  
</p>
<p>   It is strongly suggested that detection of exception scenarios
does not belong within the scope of ESDS.  This intelligence should
reside outside of the Discovery Service layer and in the supply chain's
Business Applications.

Multiple Organizations</h3>

<p>   It is ESDS's intention to provide authorized clients with the link
referral information necessary to enable client applications to gather

include link data from the design phase, through manufacture, distribution
and retail, usage period (including service, repair, maintenance,
overhaul) and even end-of-life phase (including collection, sorting,
remanufacturing and recycling).  So while there may exist lifecycle
steps within a particular supply chain, a higher perspective or meta
view could show that entire supply chain as a single step in the
life of the product. For example, an object can be in a
Manufacturing supply chain, then move into a Logistics supply chain,
followed by a Service supply chain.  Each of these particular supply
chains may have their own set of lifecycle steps, but the entire
lifecycle is spread across all three supply chains.  ESDS should
facilitate the linking of these supply chains together to enable the
capture of the entire lifecycle of the object.

Identifier Agnostic</h3>

<p>   To enable the grouping of information belonging to the same
object, each object needs to be uniquely identifiable as it moves
through the supply chain and its lifecycle steps.  The protocol cannot
safely rely on unique object identifiers alone, because an identifier
may enter the supply chain multiple times.  A sample use case for this
is returnable bins, where the same bin will go through the supply chain
many times.  Another use case is airline baggage, where the same baggage
identifier could appear the following year, due to the fact that the
identifier is only required to include a Julian date (the day of the
year) but is not required to include the year.
</p>
<p>   To define a protocol which is adoptable by the various supply
chains, it is essential that the protocol support various identifier
schemes.  The ESDS protocol should have a broad scope and support
multiple identifier schemes including schemas with non-unique
identifiers.  It must also be identifier agnostic in order for Discovery
Services to be embraced by global supply chains.

Reusing Identifiers</h3>

<p>Reusable assets and other returnable transport items may circulate
among multiple organizations - and in many situations, it may be more
economical and more feasible to tag the reusable asset than to tag its
contents.  This is particularly true when attaching not only a unique ID
tag but also environmental sensors to the reusable asset.
</p>
<p>Company A that provides and manages reusable assets can provide an
additional service to its customers, such as company B (which borrows or
leases an asset from company A), by allowing company B to access data
about the asset while it carries the products from company B.  At the
same time, there are benefits to company A in being able to track its
own assets, to balance supply and demand of assets and detect when
assets are not being returned correctly, e.g. for cleaning and
repair.
</p>
<p>However, it is also very important to protect the confidentiality of
the data for company B from its competitor, company C, who may happen to
use the same asset at a later time.
</p>
<p>One possible solution to this is for company A to dynamically manage
access permissions to data about the asset and its contents using
time-based windows that provide its customers with visibility only to
data about the asset during the time periods when it is associated with
their products or their lease/use of the asset.
</p>
<p>This could be achieved by appending additional time-based constraint
qualifications to access control policies.
</p>
<p>For example, company B could be granted visibility to track and trace
data about the asset for events that occur after they take custody of
the asset and before they relinquish custody of the asset.  Company C
might be granted access for a different time window.  There should be no
overlap between the time windows granted to competing companies, in
order to protect the confidentiality of their data.

access control and visibility of extended information and protocols.  .
One approach could be to provide one level of access to all the event

<p>   Some other policies with similar parameters but different
interpretation are the archiving policies, purging policies, and audit
policies.
</p>
<p>   The ESDS protocol needs to facilitate the definition and
customization of such policies within the supply chains.

<a name="rfc.section.5.11"></a><h3>5.11.&nbsp;
Stale Links</h3>

<p>   There are situations where the link information (such as a URL)
that was originally specified is no longer effective (e.g. because the
provider of the resource has not taken care to maintain redirection from
the original link address to the new location of the resource when
restructuring a website or moving to a different domain name).  In such
situations, it is desirable that an ESDS can provide a client with link
information that is current and effective.  For audit purposes, it may
also be necessary for an ESDS to be able to retain and reconstruct the
original (or previous) link information, even if it is no longer
effective.
</p>
<p>   This may also imply that an ESDS should allow a resource provider
to loosely couple the link record or event with the current link
address, to ease migration of multiple records to a new link address,
while still providing a mechanism to recover a full audit trail of such
changes of link addresses.  This is particularly important when the link
records are digitally signed and we wish to avoid having to ¿void¿ such
records merely because they embedded a URL which is no longer in
service.

<a name="rfc.section.5.12"></a><h3>5.12.&nbsp;
Peer-to-Peer Communications</h3>

<p>   Architecting a bootstrapping policy will involve defining a
protocol for peer-to-peer communication between Discovery Services (DS).
The ultimate goal is to locate the target DS without dependence on
hierarchical information and services such as ONS or the underlying DNS.
To facilitate the peer-to-peer communication it is recommended that
existing protocols and proven architectures such as JXTA <a class='info' href='#jxta-protocols'>[jxta&#8209;protocols]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Duigou, M., &ldquo;JXTA v2.0 Protocols Specification,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> be utilized. Another candidate architecture
is ECRIT's approach to locating authoritative sources of information in
a peer-topeer network <a class='info' href='#ecrit-mapping-arc'>[ecrit&#8209;mapping&#8209;arc]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., &ldquo;Location-to-URL Mapping Architecture and Framework,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>One point to keep in mind  with DSs is that finding one target DS
does not mean that the search is over.  One product identifier could be
acceptable to many DSs; therefore a search cannot stop once a DS is
located but needs to propagate to all peers.
</p>
<p>Care and consideration must be given to privacy and the sensitivity
of information at the DS nodes.  It is also critical that steps are
taken to protect against increased vulnerabilities that the extra
exposure that PTP brings, such as denial-of-service attacks, or data
mining tricks.
</p>
<p>   Another challenge is when the target DS is successfully located.
How much information on an object inquiry can that DS share with the
peer DS, without jeopardizing security and privacy?  Should the DSs
facilitate the peer-to-peer access negotiation process or should it be
done by the Certificate Authority? 
</p>
<p>   A sample scenario would be a query client negotiating for access
to information from an organization where the information-providing
organization does not have an established business (trust) relationship
with the client and therefore chooses initially not to reveal its
identity to the client. In this case, it is possbile to use the opaque
'node ref' concept and perhaps each object can have such a 'node ref'
handle to deal with such scenarios <a class='info' href='#bridge-discovery-services-design'>[bridge&#8209;discovery&#8209;services&#8209;design]<span> (</span><span class='info'>BRIDGE, &ldquo;BRIDGE WP02 High-level design for Discovery Services,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. Considerations must be
given to protection against data mining to discovery whether a serial
number exists.

Technical Challenges</h3>

<p>ESDS should be purely an application layer protocol disassociated
from implementation specifics and challenges. Below are some of the
technical challenges that certain business requirements demand. However
ESDS is not chartered to address  these implementation challenges.

<a name="rfc.section.6.1"></a><h3>6.1.&nbsp;
Auditability</h3>

<p>Based on some supply chain business and regulatory requirements,
auditing capabilities should be facilitated by ESDS to provide
accountability if and when something goes wrong. With an auditing
mechanism, record data can be tracked and the person responsible
identified, thus a series of data records can be reconstructed at a
later date, allowing the supply chain to prove who was responsible for
which data records <a class='info' href='#bridge-security-analysis'>[bridge&#8209;security&#8209;analysis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>BRIDGE, &ldquo;BRIDGE WP04 Security Analysis Report,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.6.2"></a><h3>6.2.&nbsp;
Responsiveness</h3>

<p>ESDS implementations will need to be designed to accept updates in a
close to real time basis from multiple providers of information across
the supply chain or lifecycle of an object. Because they store
serial-level records, they will need to be sufficiently scalable to
store large volumes of data, possibly up to trillions of records per
year. 
</p>
<a name="anchor20"></a><br /><hr />
<table summary="layout" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" class="TOCbug" align="right"><tr><td class="TOCbug"><a href="#toc">&nbsp;TOC&nbsp;</a></td></tr></table>
<a name="rfc.section.6.3"></a><h3>6.3.&nbsp;
Availability</h3>

<p>ESDS availability requirements would vary from supply chain to supply
chain. Research by BRIDGE shows that  the uptime requirements for some
supply chains are 99.99% year round.
</p>
<p>It is expected that the ESDS instances will be available over a
shared network that exposes them to the effects of network attacks.
Furthermore, in many cases it is expected that these components should
be globally reachable from the Internet and not hosted on a secure
private network.  Such components are also built using commonly
available Operating Systems and middleware (e.g. Application Servers).
Thus they are also subject to any vulnerabilities of these supporting
systems.
</p>
<p>A major security issue for shared services such as the ESDS or ONS is
service availability. In particular if you consider services that are
vital for supply chain processes (e.g. "pharma e-Pedigree" or
"product-authentication") ESDS needs to be able to guarantee minimal
amount of service downtime due to security vulnerabilities and attacks
<a class='info' href='#bridge-security-analysis'>[bridge&#8209;security&#8209;analysis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>BRIDGE, &ldquo;BRIDGE WP04 Security Analysis Report,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Related Activities</h3>

<p>   Currently, the standards organization EPCglobal, and EU research
projects BRIDGE, SMART, and PROMISE are looking into the global supply
chain track-and-trace challenge.  As part of their research, each of
them has identified the need for Discovery Services to link resources
and clients in the supply chains.
</p>
<p>   EPCglobal is beginning to gather user requirements for Discovery
Services.  However, EPCglobal is a paid membership organization focused
on serving their own subscriber community.  Although the final ratified
EPCglobal standards are open and freely available to download, the
subscription fees for joining the EPCglobal community may deter a
significant proportion of the global supply chain community from
directly participating in the development of their global standards.
</p>
<p>   IETF would be the ideal body to oversee the development of this
protocol because of its deep knowledge of Internet infrastructure and
experience with development of application layer protocols.
</p>
<p>   An IETF working group would be an inviting and open community
which facilitates contribution and participation of all interested
parties involved in the global supply chain.  Unlike an EPCglobal work
group, there would be no economic barriers to participation in the
development of the technical standard.  The output would be released as
a freely available RFC in the public domain.  ESDS will make best
efforts to ensure good communication with complementary activities at
EPCglobal, in order to ensure that the output of ESDS is as relevant and
useful as possible to a future EPCglobal standard for Discovery
Services.
