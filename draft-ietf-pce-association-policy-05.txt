1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element communication
   Protocol (PCEP) which enables the communication between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between
   two PCEs based on the PCE architecture [RFC4655].  [RFC5394] provides
   additional details on policy within the PCE architecture and also
   provides context for the support of PCE Policy.

   PCEP Extensions for Stateful PCE Model [RFC8231] describes a set of
   extensions to PCEP to enable active control of Multiprotocol Label
   Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalzied MPLS (GMPLS)
   tunnels.  [RFC8281] describes the setup and teardown of PCE-initiated

   LSPs under the active stateful PCE model, without the need for local
   configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic network.
   Currently, the LSPs can either be signaled via Resource Reservation
   Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) or can be segment routed as
   specified in [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing].

   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] introduces a generic mechanism to
   create a grouping of LSPs which can then be used to define
   associations between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such as
   configuration parameters or behaviors) and is equally applicable to
   stateful PCE (active and passive modes) and stateless PCE.

   This document specifies a PCEP extension to associate one or more
   LSPs with policies using the generic association mechanism.

   A PCEP speaker may want to influence the PCEP peer with respect to
   path selection and other policies.  This document describes a PCEP
   extension to associate policies by creating Policy Association Group
   (PAG) and encoding this association in PCEP messages.  The
   specification is applicable to both stateful and stateless PCEP
   sessions.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   Association parameters:  As described in
      [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group], the combination of the mandatory
      fields Association type, Association ID and Association Source in
      the ASSOCIATION object uniquely identify the association group.
      If the optional TLVs - Global Association Source or Extended
      Association ID are included, then they are included in combination
      with mandatory fields to uniquely identifying the association
      group.

   Association information:  As described in
      [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group], the ASSOCIATION object could
      include other optional TLVs based on the association types, that
      provides 'information' related to the association.

   LSR:  Label Switch Router.

   LSR:  Label Switch Router.

   MPLS:  Multiprotocol Label Switching.

   PAG:  Policy Association Group.

   PCC:  Path Computation Client.  Any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Communication Protocol.

3.  Motivation

   Paths computed using PCE can be subjected to various policies on both
   PCE and PCC.  For example, in a centralized traffic engineering
   scenario, network operators may instantiate LSPs and specifies
   policies for traffic steering, path monitoring, etc., for some LSPs
   via the stateful PCE.  Similarly, a PCC could request a user- or
   service-specific policy to be applied at the PCE, such as constraints
   relaxation to meet optimal QoS and resiliency.

   PCEP speaker can use the generic mechanism as per
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] to associate a set of LSPs with a
   policy, without the need to know the details of such a policy, which
   simplifies network operations, avoids frequent software upgrades, as
   well provides an ability to introduce new policy faster.

3.1.  Policy based Constraints

   In the context of policy-enabled path computation [RFC5394], path
   computation policies may be applied at both a PCC and a PCE.
   Consider an Label Switch Router (LSR) with a policy enabled PCC, it
   receives a service request via signaling, including over a Network-
   Network Interface (NNI) or User Network Interface (UNI) reference
   point, or receives a configuration request over a management
   interface to establish a service.  The PCC may also apply user- or
   service-specific policies to decide how the path selection process
   should be constrained, that is, which constraints, diversities,
   optimization criterion, and constraint relaxation strategies should
   be applied in order for the service LSP(s) to have a likelihood to be
   successfully established and provide necessary QoS and resilience
   against network failures.  The user- or service-specific policies

Internet-Draft                ASSOC-POLICY                 February 2019


   applied to PCC and are then passed to the PCE along with the Path
   computation request, in the form of constraints [RFC5394].

   PCEP speaker can use the generic mechanism as per
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] to associate a set of LSPs with
   policy and its resulting path computation constraints.  This would
   simplify the path computation message exchanges in PCEP.

4.  Overview

   As per [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group], LSPs are associated with
   other LSPs with which they interact by adding them to a common
   association group.  Grouping can also be used to define association
   between LSPs and policies associated to them.  One new Association
   Type is defined in this document, based on the generic Association
   object -

   o  Association type = TBD1 ("Policy Association Type") for Policy
      Association Group (PAG).

   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] specify the mechanism for the
   capability advertisement of the association types supported by a PCEP
   speaker by defining a ASSOC-Type-List TLV to be carried within an
   OPEN object.  This capability exchange for the association type
   described in this document (i.e.  Policy Association Type) MUST be
   done before using the policy association.  Thus the PCEP speaker MUST
   include the Policy Association Type (TBD1) in the ASSOC-Type-List TLV
   before using the PAG in the PCEP messages.

   This Association-Type is operator-configured association in nature
   and created by the operator manually on the PCEP peers.  The LSP
   belonging to this associations is conveyed via PCEP messages to the
   PCEP peer.  Operator-configured Association Range SHOULD NOT be set
   for this association-type, and MUST be ignored, so that the full
   range of association identifier can be utilized.

   A PAG can have one or more LSPs and its associated policy.  The
   association parameters including association identifier, type
   (Policy), as well as the association source IP address is manually
   configured by the operator and is used to identify the PAG as
   described in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].  The Global
   Association Source and Extended Association ID MAY also be included.

   As per the processing rules specified in section 5.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group], if a PCEP speaker does not support
   this Policy association-type, it would return a PCErr message with
   Error-Type 26 (Early allocation by IANA) "Association Error" and
   Error-Value 1 "Association-type is not supported".  Since the PAG is



Litkowski, et al.        Expires August 7, 2019                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                ASSOC-POLICY                 February 2019


   opaque in nature, the PAG and the policy MUST be configured on the
   PCEP peers as per the operator-configured association procedures.
   All processing is as per section 5.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].  If a PCE speaker receives PAG in a
   PCEP message, and the policy association information is not
   configured, it MUST return a PCErr message with Error-Type TBD
   "Association Error" and Error- Value 4 "Association unknown".  If
   some of the association information [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group]
   (the TLVs defined in this document) received from the peer does not
   match the local configured values, the PCEP speaker MUST reject the
   PCEP message and send a PCErr message with Error-Type 26 (Early
   allocation by IANA) "Association Error" and Error-Value 5 "Operator-
   configured association information mismatch".

5.  Policy Association Group

   Association groups and their memberships are defined using the
   ASSOCIATION object defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].  Two
   object types for IPv4 and IPv6 are defined.  The ASSOCIATION object
   includes "Association type" indicating the type of the association
   group.  This document add a new Association type -

   Association type = TBD1 ("Policy Association Type") for PAG.

   PAG may carry optional TLVs including but not limited to -

   o  POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV: Used to communicate opaque information
      useful to apply the policy, described in Section 5.1.

   o  VENDOR-INFORMATION-TLV: Used to communicate arbitrary vendor
      specific behavioral information, described in [RFC7470].

5.1.  Policy Parameters TLV

   The POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV is an optional TLV that can be carried in
   ASSOCIATION object (with "Policy Association Type") to carry opaque
   information needed to apply the policy at the PCEP peer.  In some
   cases to apply a PCE policy successfully, it is required to also
   associate some policy parameters that needs to be evaluated, to
   successfully apply the said policy.  This TLV is used to carry those
   policy parameters.  The TLV could include one or more policy related
   parameter.  The encoding format and the order MUST be known to the
   PCEP peers, this could be done during configuration of policy (and
   its association parameters) for the PAG.  The TLV format is as per
   the format of the PCEP TLVs, as defined in [RFC5440], and shown in
   Figure 2.  Only one POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV can be carried and only the
   first occurrence is processed and any others MUST be ignored.

      +---------------------------------------------------------------+



                Figure 2: The POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV format

   The type of the POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV is TBD2 and it has a variable
   length.  The Value field is variable field padded to a 4-bytes
   alignment; padding is not included in the Length field.  The PCEP
   peer implementation need to be aware of the encoding format, order,
   and meaning of the 'Policy Parameters' well in advance based on the
   policy.  Note that from the protocol point of view this data is
   opaque and can be used to carry parameters in any format understood
   by the PCEP peers and associated to the policy.  The exact use of
   this TLV is beyond the scope of this document.

   If the PCEP peer is unaware of the policy parameters associated with
   the policy and it receives the POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV, it MUST ignore
   the TLV and SHOULD log this event.  Further, if one or more
   parameters received in the POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV received by the PCEP
   speaker are considered as unacceptable in the context of the
   associated policy (e.g. out of range value, badly encoded value...),
   the PCEP speaker MUST NOT apply the received policy and SHOULD log
   this event.

   Note that, the vendor specific behavioral information is encoded in
   VENDOR-INFORMATION-TLV which can be used along with this TLV.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines one new type for association, which do not add
   any new security concerns beyond those discussed in [RFC5440],
   [RFC8231] and [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] in itself.

   Some deployments may find policy associations and their implications
   as extra sensitive and thus should employ suitable PCEP security
   mechanisms like [RFC8253].  Also extra care needs to be taken by the
   implementation with respect to POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV while decoding,
   verifying and applying these policy variables.

   TBD1      Policy Association Type     [This I.D.]

7.2.  PCEP TLV Type Indicators

   The following TLV Type Indicator values are requested within the
   "PCEP TLV Type Indicators" subregistry of the "Path Computation
   Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry:

   Value     Description                 Reference

   TBD2      POLICY-PARAMETERS-TLV       [This I.D.]

8.  Manageability Considerations

8.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   An operator MUST be allowed to configure the policy associations at
   PCEP peers and associate it with the LSPs.  They MAY also allow
   configuration to related policy parameters, in which case the an
   operator MUST also be allowed to set the encoding format and order to
   parse the associated policy parameters TLV.

8.2.  Information and Data Models

   An implementation SHOULD allow the operator to view the PAG
   configured.  Further implementation SHOULD allow to view the current
   set of LSPs in the PAG.  To serve this purpose, the PCEP YANG module
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang] includes association groups and can be used
   for PAG.

8.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440].

8.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC5440].

8.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new requirements
   on other protocols.

8.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not have any impact on network
   operations in addition to those already listed in [RFC5440].
