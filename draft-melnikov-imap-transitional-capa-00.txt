Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.  Internet-Drafts are working
   documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas,
   and its working groups.  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   A revised version of this draft document will be submitted to the RFC
   editor as a Proposed Standard for the Internet Community.  Discussion
   and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to
   the IMAPEXT Mailing list <ietf-imapext@imc.org>. Distribution of this
   draft is unlimited.

Abstract

   Software releases can't always wait for some document to become an
   RFC.  As the result some software products are released when they
   implement a non-final version of an IMAP [IMAP4] extension. This may
   cause substantial interoperability problems between clients and
   servers that implement different revisions of the same document, as
   syntax and semantics of operations may change substantially between
   revisions of the same IMAP extension draft.

   There is also a need to have transitional IMAP capabilities for

   testing purposes.

   This document defines a convention for IMAP capability strings that
   allows to reference an IMAP extension as defined by a particular
   revision of a draft.


1.   Conventions Used in this Document

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" in
   this document when typed in uppercase are to be interpreted as
   defined in "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"
   [KEYWORDS].


2.   Transitional IMAP capabilities

   This document reserves a prefix for referencing an IMAP extension as
   defined by a draft revision.  A draft defines a base capability name
   <EXTENSION>, which will be used when (and if) the document is
   approved as an RFC. For a draft revision <nn> and a ownership <o>
   (one of "I" - individual submission or "W" - a WG document) an
   implementation of the draft that also conforms to this document
   should advertise a capability "X-DRAFT-<o><nn>-<EXTENSION>".

   For example, if <EXTENSION> is URLAUTH and the draft revision number
   is 09 and it is an individual submission, the advertised capability
   string would be "X-DRAFT-I09-URLAUTH".

   Note that the defined convention MUST NOT be used with SASL
   capabilities.

   One of the advantages of the proposed convention is that an IMAP
   client can support multiple revisions of the same draft by checking
   "X-DRAFT-" prefix and then checking the suffix (e.g. "URLAUTH").

   <o> field in a transitional capability string helps to cope with a
   situation when a draft is initially submitted as a individual
   submission, which is later on accepted as a WG document. Without this
   field the revision number will go back to "00" when the draft is
   resubmitted as a WG document.


3.   Security Considerations

   One of the purposes of this document is to be able to distinguish two
   implementations that comply with different versions of the same IMAP
   extension. This might help to improve interoperability, and,

   hopefully, security.

   It is believed that this extension doesn't raise any additional
   security concerns not already discussed in [IMAP4].


4.   Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [ABNF]. Non-terminals referenced
   but not defined below are as defined by [IMAP4].

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
   insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to define
   token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
   accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

      capability      =/ transit_capa
                          ; transit_capa falls under "X" prefix

      transit_capa    = "X-DRAFT-" ownership revision "-" atom
                          ; MUST NOT be used with SASL capabilities
                          ; starting with "AUTH="

      ownership       = "I" / "W"
                          ; "I" means that the draft is an individual
                          ; submission; "W" means a WG document

      revision        = 2DIGIT
                          ; 2 digit draft revision number
