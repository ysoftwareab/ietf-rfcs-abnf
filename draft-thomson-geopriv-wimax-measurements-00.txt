Abstract

   IEEE 802.16e defines means for true mobility within an 802.16
   wireless network.  Determining an accurate location for 802.16e
   devices requires information on radio parameters.  A format is
   defined for location-related measurement data that can be provided by
   an 802.16e device.  This measurement data can be used by a Location
   Information Server (LIS) to more accurately determine the location of
   the device.

Internet-Draft      Location Measurements for 802.16e           May 2008


1.  Introduction

   Determining the location of a device in an IEEE 802.16e [IEEE.80216E]
   mobile wireless network requires information from the device to
   improve the accuracy of the final result.  Radio timing information
   provided by the device can enable the calculation of a more accurate
   location estimate by a Location Information Server (LIS).

   This document describes a standard format for 802.16e measurement
   data that is based on radio measurements made of base stations near
   the device.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   This document builds on [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements] and
   consequently uses the same set of terminology.  Terminology from
   [IEEE.80216E] is used where appropriate.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  802.16e Measurement Data

   A subscriber station (SS) in an 802.16e network is able to observe
   radio signals from each base station (BS) in its proximity.  By
   observing the timing and strength of these signals, a SS is able to
   provide a LIS with information that can be used to determine its
   location.

   The most basic 802.16e measurement indicates the serving BS, as shown
   in Figure 1.

     <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held">
       <locationType exact="true">civic</locationType>
       <measurements xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:lm">
         <w16e xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:lm:802.16e">
           <servingBS id="00-21-43-65-87-a9"/>
         </w16e>
       </measurements>
     </locationRequest>

       Figure 1: HELD Location Request with 802.16e Measurement Data

   More measurement information can be provided, including timing
   measurement information for additional serving base stations (if fast
   base station switching or macro-diversity hand-over are in progress).
   Information on neighbouring base stations can be provided in addition
   to that for the serving BS, or instead of if the SS is not currently
   attached to the 802.16e interface.

   The set measurement data that is included is chosen by the SS and
   will depend on the time it has available to acquire the measurements.
   The following measurement information may be provided:

   id:  (Attribute) The base station identifier for the serving or
      neighbour BS.  Note that while this isn't a MAC address, it shares
      the encoding defined for the MAC address.

   rssi:  The receive signal strength indicator, calculated as defined
      in [IEEE.80216E].  This value is measured in units of dBm.  This
      datum optionally includes an RMS error in dB and sample count.

   cinr:  The signal to noise ratio, calculated as defined in
      [IEEE.80216E].  This value is measured in units of dB.  This datum
      optionally includes an RMS error and sample count.

   rd:  Relative delay of the signal from the BS, measured relative to
      other base stations.  Since this value is relative, it MUST be
      included on at least two BS measurements to be of any use.  It is
      RECOMMENDED that this value be set to "0" for the first BS in the
      measured set.  This value is measured in seconds, but measurement
      uncertainty for a single sample is expected to be approximately
      one sample.  This datum optionally includes an RMS error and
      sample count.

                                 | BS3

                       Figure 2: Relative Delay Example

      Based on the example in Figure 2, relative delay can be calculated
      based on the relative time that signals transmitted simultaneously
      (or with known relative times) by base stations can be calculated.
      If the time of receipt of the signal from each base station is
      t[x] and the relative delay for BS1 is set to zero, the relative
      time for each subsequent measured base station is t[x] - t[1].

   rtd:  Round trip delay of the signal from the SS to the BS and back.
      This measurement datum is only applicable for each serving BS.
      This value is measured in seconds, but measurement uncertainty for
      a single sample is expected to be approximately one sample.  This
      datum optionally includes an RMS error and sample count.

   The "rmsError" attribute for signal to noise and received signal
   strength MAY be calculated using the continuous weighted average
   method described in [IEEE.80216E].  Values of "alpha_AVG" and "k" are
   selected by the SS.

   The XML format described in this document provides a greater range of
   values than the Scanning Results Report ("MOB_SCN-REP") or the
   Channel measurement Report Response ("REP-RSP") message.  This allows
   for the reporting of measurements in a manner less constrained by
   encoding.  A greater range of values does not necessarily imply
   anything about the uncertainty in those measurements; the RMS error

5.  Security Considerations

   The considerations of [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements] apply.
   However, the receiver of 802.16e measurement information requires
   knowledge of the location of base stations to make effective use of
   the information.
