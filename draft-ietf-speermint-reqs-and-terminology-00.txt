Internet-Draft   SPEERMINT Requirements and Terminology    February 2006


1.  Introduction

   The term "VoIP Peering" has historically been used to describe a wide
   variety of aspects pertaining to the interconnection of service
   provider networks and to the delivery of SIP call termination over
   those interconnections.  The discussion of these interconnections has
   at times been confused by the fact that the term "peering" is used in
   various contexts to relate to interconnection at different levels in
   a protocol stack.  Session Peering for Multimedia Interconnect
   focuses on how to identify and route real-time sessions (such as VoIP
   calls) at the application layer, and it does not (necessarily)
   involve the exchange of packet routing data or media sessions.  In
   particular, "layer 5 network" is used here to refer to the
   interconnection between SIP servers, as opposed to interconnection at
   the IP layer ("layer 3").  Finally, the terms "peering" and
   "interconnect" are used interchangeably throughout this document.

   This document introduces standard terminology for use in
   characterizing real-time session interconnection.  Note however, that
   while this document is primarily targeted at the VoIP interconnect
   case, the terminology described here is applicable to those cases in
   which service providers interconnect using SIP signaling for real-
   time or quasi-real-time communications.

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows: Section 3
   provides the requirements for SPEERMINT working group solutions.
   Section 2 provides the general context for the VOIPEER Working Group,
   and Section 4 provides the general definitions for real-time SIP
   based communication, with focus on the VoIP interconnect case.
   Section 5 briefly touches on terms from the ENUM Working Group.
   Finally, Section 6 provides comments on usage.


2.  Context

   Figure 1 depicts the general VoIP interconnect context.  In this
   case, the caller uses an E.164 number [ITU.E164.1991] as the "name"
   of the called user.  Note that this E.164 number is not an address,
   since at this point we do not have information about where the named
   endpoint is located.  In the case shown here, an E.164 number is used
   as a key to retrieve a NAPTR recored [RFC3404] from the DNS, which in
   turn resolved into a SIP URI.  Call routing is based on this SIP URI.
   The call routing step does not depend on the presence of an E.164
   number; the SIP URI can be advertised in various other ways, such as
   on a web page.  Finally, note that the subsequent lookup steps,
   namely, lookup of SRV, A, and AAAA records (as well as any routing
   steps below that) are outside the scope of VOIPEER.

                    Figure 1: VoIP Interconnect Context

   The ENUM Working Group is primarily concerned with the acquisition of
   Call Routing Data, or CRD (i.e., above the double line in Figure 1),
   while the VOIPEER Working Group is focused on the use of such CRD.
   Importantly, the CRD can be derived from ENUM (i.e., an E.164 DNS
   entry), or via any other mechanism available to the user.


3.  Requirements

   A system for real-time session interconnection must satisfy the
   following requirements:

3.1.  Unified solution for all peering policies

   Policies developed in the context of the SPEERMINT working group must
   be extensible and flexible enough to cover existing and future
   peering policies.  These start by a closed system which accepts only
   incoming calls from selected peers (i.e. a set of bilateral peerings)
   and include the model of membership in a number of peering fabrics or
   carrier clubs.  The case of an open SIP proxy should be covered as a
   special case as well.

Internet-Draft   SPEERMINT Requirements and Terminology    February 2006


3.2.  Domain Based

   Although the initial call routing may be based on E.164 numbers, a
   generic peering methodology should not rely on such numbers.  Rather,
   call routing should rely on URIs.  We assume that all SIP URIs with
   the same domain-part share the same set of peering policies, thus the
   domain of the SIP URI may be used as the primary key to any
   information regarding the reachability of that SIP URI.

3.3.  No blocked calls

   An originating Voice Service Provider, or VSP, must be able to
   determine whether a SIP URI is open for direct interconnection
   without actually sending a SIP INVITE.  This is important as
   unsuccessful call attempts are highly undesirable since they can
   introduce high delays due to timeouts and can act as an unintended
   denial of service attack. (e.g., by repeated TLS handshakes).

3.4.  Scaling

   The maintenance of the system needs to scale beyond simple lists of
   peering partners.  In particular, it must incorporate aggregation
   mechanisms which avoid O(n2) scaling (where n is the number of
   participating VoIP services).  Per-VSP opt-in without consultation of
   a centralized 'peering registry', but rather by publishing local
   configuration choices only is highly desirable.  The distributed
   management of the DNS is a good example for the scalability of this
   approach.

3.5.  Independence of lower layers

   The system needs to be independent of details on what technologies
   are used route the call and which are used to ensure that only
   approved peering partner actually connect to the destination SIP
   proxy.  It should not matter whether restrictions are implemented by
   private L3 connectivity ("walled gardens"), firewalls, TLS policies
   or SIP proxy configuration.

3.6.  Administrative and technical policies

   The reasons for declining vs. accepting incoming calls from a
   prospective peering partner can be both administrative (contractual,
   legal, commercial, or business decisions) and technical (certain QoS
   parameters, TLS keys, domain keys, ...).  Methodologies developed by
   the SPEERMINT working group should accommodate all policies.

Internet-Draft   SPEERMINT Requirements and Terminology    February 2006


3.7.  Minimal additional cost on call initiation

   Since each call setup implies execution of any proposed algorithm it
   should incur minimal overhead and delay, and employ caching wherever
   possible to avoid extra protocol round trips.

3.8.  Look beyond SIP

   The problem of selective peering is not limited to SIP-based
   communication.  Other protocols may benefit from a generic framework
   as well, such as SMTP mail.  Any solutions proposed by the SPEERMINT
   working group must be generic enough to encompass other protocols as
   well.


4.  General Definitions

4.1.  Call Routing Data

   Call Routing Data, or CRD, is a SIP URI used to route a call (real-
   time, voice or other type) to the called domain's ingress point.  A
   domain's ingress point can be thought of as the location pointed to
   by the SRV record that resulted from the resolution of the CRD (i.e.,
   a SIP URI).

4.2.  Call Routing

   Call routing is the set of processes, rules, and CRD used to route a
   VoIP call to its proper (SIP) destination.  More generally, call
   routing can be thought of as the set of processes, rules and CRD
   which are used to route a real-time session to its termination
   (ingress) point.

4.3.  PSTN

   The term "PSTN" refers to the Public Switched Telephone Network.  In
   particular, the PSTN refers to the collection of interconnected
   circuit-switched voice-oriented public telephone networks, both
   commercial and government-owned.  In general, PSTN terminals are
   addressed using E.164 numbers, noting that various dial-plans (such
   as emergency services dial-plans) may not directly use E.164 numbers.

4.4.  Network

   For purposes of this document and the VOIPEER and ENUM Working
   Groups, a network is defined to be the set of SIP servers and end-
   users (customers) that are controlled by a single administrative
   domain.  The network may also contain end-users who are located on



Meyer                    Expires August 18, 2006                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   SPEERMINT Requirements and Terminology    February 2006


   the PSTN.

4.5.  VoIP Service Provider

   A VoIP service provider is an entity that provides transport of SIP
   signaling (and possibly media streams) to its customers.  Such a
   service provider may additionally be interconnected with other
   service providers; that is, it may "peer" with other service
   providers.  A VoIP service provider may also interconnect with the
   PSTN.

   Note that as soon as a ingress point is advertised via a SRV record,
   anyone can find that ingress point and hence can send calls there.
   This is very similar to sending mail to a SMTP server based on the
   existence of a MX record.

4.6.  Peering

   While the precise definition of the term "peering" is the subject of
   some debate, peering in general refers to the negotiation of
   reciprocal interconnection arrangements, settlement-free or
   otherwise, between operationally independent service providers.

   This document distinguishes two types of peering, Layer 3 Peering and
   Layer 5 peering, which are described below.

4.6.1.  Layer 3 Peering

   Layer 3 peering refers to interconnection of two service providers
   for the purposes of exchanging IP packets which destined for one (or
   both) of the peer's networks.  Layer 3 peering is generally agnostic
   to the IP payload, and is frequently achieved using a routing
   protocol such as BGP [RFC1771] to exchange the required routing
   information.

   An alternate, perhaps more operational definition of layer 3 peering
   is that two peers exchange only customer routes, and hence any
   traffic between peers terminates on one of the peer's network.

4.6.2.  Layer 5 Peering

   Layer 5 peering refers to interconnection of two service providers
   for the purposes of SIP signaling.  Note that in the layer 5 peering
   case, there is no intervening network.  That is, for purposes of this
   discussion, there is no such thing as a "Layer 5 Transit Network".

Internet-Draft   SPEERMINT Requirements and Terminology    February 2006


4.7.  VoIP Peering

   VoIP peering is defined to be a layer 5 peering between two VoIP
   providers for purposes of routing real-time (or quasi-real time) call
   signaling between their respective customers.  Media streams
   associated with this signaling (if any) are not constrained to follow
   the same set of paths.


5.  ENUM

   ENUM [RFC3761] defines how the Domain Name System (DNS) can be used
   for identifying available services connected to one E.164 number.

5.1.  Carrier of Record

   For purposes of this document, "Carrier of Record", or COR, refers to
   the entity that provides PSTN service for an E.164 number
   [I-D.lind-infrastructure-enum-reqs].  The exact definition of who and
   what is a COR is ultimately the responsibility of the relevant
   National Regulatory Authority.

5.2.  Public ENUM

   Public ENUM is generally defined as the set administrative policies
   and procedures surrounding the use of the e164.arpa domain for
   Telephone Number to URI resolution [RFC3761].  Policies and
   procedures for the registration of telephone numbers within all
   branches of the e164.arpa tree are Nation State issues by agreement
   with the IAB and ITU.  National Regulatory Authorities have generally
   defined Public ENUM Registrants as the E.164 number holder as opposed
   to the COR that issued the phone number.

5.3.  Private ENUM

   Private ENUM is generally regarded as one or more technologies
   (including DNS and SIP Redirect) that service providers or
   enterprises may use to exchange phone number to URI mappings in a
   private secure manner.  Private ENUM may be used in any mutually
   agreed upon domain.  Records in Private ENUM may be globally visible
   but in most cases are not visible to the global Internet and are
   protected using a variety of security technologies such as split-DNS,
   VPN's or various forms or authentication and authorization.
   Technical comments on issues surrounding split-DNS can be found in
   [RFC2826].

Internet-Draft   SPEERMINT Requirements and Terminology    February 2006


5.4.  Carrier ENUM

   Carrier ENUM is generally regarded as the use of a separate branch
   the e164.arpa tree, such as 4.4.c.e164.arpa to permit service
   providers to exchange phone number to URI data in order to find
   points of interconnection.  The current theory of Carrier ENUM is
   that only the COR for a particular E.164 number is permitted to
   provision data for that E.164 within that portion of the e164.arpa
   tree.

   In carrier ENUM case, only the COR may enter data in the
   corresponding domain.  The COR may also enter CRD (i.e., a SIP URI)
   to allow other VoIP Service Providers to route calls to its network.

   Finally, note that ENUM is not constrained to carry only data (CDR)
   as defined by VOIPEER.  In particular, an an important class of CRD,
   the tel URIs [RFC3966] may be carried in ENUM.  Such tel URIs are
   most frequently used to interconnect with the PSTN directly, and are
   out of scope for VOIPEER.  On the other hand, PSTN endpoints served
   by a COR and reachable via CDR and networks as defined in Section 4.1
   and Section 4.4 are in scope for VOIPEER.


6.  Conclusions


7.  Acknowledgments

   Many of the definitions were gleaned from detailed discussions on the
   VOIPEER, ENUM, and SIPPING mailing lists.  Scott Brim, Mike Hammer,
   Jean-Francois Mule, Richard Shocky, Henry Sinnreich, and Richard
   Stastny all made valuable contributions to early revisions of this
   document.  Patrik Faltstrom also made many insightful comments to
   early versions of this draft, and contributed the basis of Figure 1.
   Finally, Otmar Lendl contributed much of the text found in the
   Requirements section.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document itself introduces no new security considerations.
   However, it is important to note that VoIP interconnect has a wide
   variety of security issues that should be considered in documents
   addressing both protocol and use case analyzes.
