Abstract

   This document represents the object oriented information model for
   representing policy information associated with provisioning IP VPN
   services such as firewall, address translation, quality of service,
   encryption. This draft extends the core policy information model to
   cover the policies that need to be enforced to configure IP VPN
   services mentioned earlier. The information model defined in this
   document is independent of any implementation specifics related to
   the repository used to store the policy information.

1. Introduction

   The term _IP VPN_ is used to denote VPN services delivered over an
   IP network. The goal of IP VPN provisioning is to align the network
   elements to provide consistent treatment to selected pieces of IP
   traffic. The network elements will require a combination of
   capabilities depending largely on their location in the topology and
   the technology being used. The classification and treatment of the
   traffic should be technology independent. However the models
   described in this document will lend themselves to easier
   implementation over certain standardized technologies in each of the
   traffic treatment areas.
   The IP VPN policy information model is based on the _Policy
   Framework Core Information Model_ [PCIM]. The core model has been
   extended to address the requirement that network elements deliver
   the services required by the network user. The network elements
   receive their configuration in the form of policies. The policies
   are stored and distributed using the policy framework described in
   [PFRAME].
   The IP VPN policy information model references classes from the
   _Policy Framework Core Information Model_ [PCIM], the _QoS Policy
   Information Model_ [QPIM], the _MPLS Policy Information Model_[MPIM]
   and the _IPSEC Configuration Policy Model_ [IPSECIM]. The
   corresponding LDAP implementations could be built based on the
   _Policy Framework LDAP Core Schema_ [PCIM-LDAP] and _QoS Policy
   Schema_[QOSIM-LDAP] implementations.

   This document is organized as follows:

   1. Section 2 provides a quick introduction to the Unified Modeling
      Language(UML) graphical notation used in this document
   2. Section 3 defines the inheritance hierarchy in the context of the
      policy core information model
   3. Section 4 defines the containment hierarchy in the context of the
      policy core information model
   4. Section 5 provides details on the classes defined in the
      information model
   5. Section 6 revisits the Policy Rule class[PCIM].
   6. Section 7 explains the positioning of this work w.r.t related
      work being done in the IETF.
   7. Section 8 deals with extending the IP VPN policy schema
2. UML Notation

   The information model is presented in this document using UML
   notation since it a well accepted standard and provides a task
   independent way to model systems.
   1. Boxes represent classes
   2. A _o_ denotes an aggregation. An aggregation is essentially a
      reference.
   3. A _x_ denotes containment. A contained object is owned entirely
      by the container.
   4. The association line may be annotated with _multiplicity_ which
      indicates the number of objects aggregated or contained.
      - a range of the form _a..b_ indicates the minimum and maximum
        number of objects
      - an asterisk indicates any number of objects

3. Inheritance Hierarchy

   The inheritance hierarchy shows the new classes introduced in this
   document and their relationship to the relevant classes in [PCIM].

   This [MPIM] draft is yet to be positioned in the appropriate WG.
   These classes may be redefined within this document if required. The
   intention here is to keep the class definitions to be identical to
   enable the easy translation from the IP VPN service requirements to
   MPLS traffic trunk configuration.
   Property Definitions imported from [QPIM]

   1. gpIPv4AddrList - This Property is defined in [QPIM] to represent
      an unordered list of Ipv4 addresses.
   2. gpIPv6AddrList - This Property is defined in [QPIM] to represent
      an unordered list of Ipv6 addresses.

   The new classes introduced are in the following areas:

   - ipvpnServicePolicyRule which extends the gpsPolicyRule class to
     include the semantics required to define an IP VPN service.
   - ipvpnApplicationSignatureValue, ipvpnEnforcerProfileValue which
     extend the gpsPolicyValue class to capture the L7 classification
     requirements and the enforcer capabilities respectively
   - ipvpnPolicyRoutingAction to capture the policy based routing which
     defines the topology of the IP VPN service
   - ipvpnPolicyNATAction, ipvpnPolicyFirewallAction,
     ipvpnPolicyEncryptionAction which extend PolicyAction to capture

   The important aspects to be highlighted in the containment tree are:

   - the gpsPolicyCompoundCondition is used to provide a quick means of
     deciding whether the traffic under consideration belongs to the
     VPN service or not.
   - The ipvpnPolicyRoutingAction objects reflect the topology required
     for implementing the IP VPN service e.g. hub and spoke, full mesh,
     partial mesh, point to point etc. This component provides a
     complete description of the connectivity requirement of the IP VPN
     service.
   - The gpsPolicyGroup aggregates the complete set of policy rules to
     be enforced for traffic belonging to this IP VPN service. This
     component provides a complete description of the security and QoS
     requirements of the IP VPN service.
   - The ipvpnPolicyDomain reflects the administrative, functional and
     enforcement information related to the IP VPN service.

5. Class Definitions

   5.1 The Class ipvpnServicePolicyRule

   The ipvpnServicePolicyRule represents the policies corresponding to
   an ipvpnService definition. It is associated with a
   gpsPolicyCompondCondition object and a gpsPolicyGroup object. It
   extends the semantics of the gpsPolicyRule by means of a contained
   ipvpnPolicyDomain object. The ipvpnServicePolicyRule can contain
   nested ipvpnServicePolicyRule(s).

   NAME                 ipvpnServicePolicyRule
   DESCRIPTION          The class for holding the conditions and
                        policies required to implement the ipvpnService.

                             [ref ipvpnPolicyRoutingAction[1..n]],
                        ipvpnServicePolicyGroup 
                             [ref gpsPolicyGroup[1]],
                        ipvpnServicePolicyDomain 
                             [ref ipvpnServicePolicyDomain[1]]

   The aggregation gpsPolicyRuleInPolicyRule provides nesting of
   ipvpnServicePolicyRule(s). The aggregation PolicyRuleInPolicyGroup
   provides association of an unordered list of PolicyRules

   5.1.1 The Reference ipvpnServicePolicyCondition

   This is a reference to a gpsPolicyCompoundCondition. It is used to
   decide whether the traffic matches the aggregate conditions of the
   ipvpnServicePolicyRule. This property summarizes the conditions of
   the policy rules within the gpsPolicyGroup. This will enable quick
   determination of whether any one of the contained policy rules will
   match the traffic. This property can be automatically derived by
   examining the policy rules, however the true potential is realized
   when it is summarized by the administrator.

   5.1.2 The Reference ipvpnServicePolicyRouting

   This is a reference to one or more ipvpnPolicyRoutingAction(s) which
   implement the IP VPN service topology. The routing actions will
   enable to administrator to create point to point, hub and spoke,
   full mesh and partial mesh topologies. The routing actions capture
   the connectivity requirements of the IP VPN service.

   5.1.3 The Reference ipvpnServicePolicyGroup

   This is a reference to a gpsPolicyGroup which contains the
   PolicyRules required to implement the ipvpnService. The policy rules
   capture the security and QoS requirements of the IP VPN service.

   5.1.4 The Reference ipvpnServicePolicyDomain

   This is a reference to an ipvpnPolicyDomain object that holds
   various domain attributes of the ipvpnServicePolicyRule.
   The domain attributes are inherited by the nested
   ipvpnServicePolicyRule(s). The nested containers can override them.
   The overriding values cannot exceed the scope of the values in the
   parent ipvpnServicePolicyRule.

   5.2 The Class ipvpnApplicationSignatureValue
   Specifies the L4-L7 characteristics of the packet including
   application level decodes which require stateful inspection of the
   packet e.g HTTP, FTP, SMTP, TELNET etc.

7. Positioning w.r.t. existing policy framework WG drafts: [PCIM],
  [QPIM]

     The IP VPN information model is derived from [PCIM]. It extends
     the classes defined in the [PCIM]. It is a policy application
     which uses the building blocks provided by the [PCIM].
     The IP VPN information model reuses a number of extensions defined
     in [QPIM]. The expectation (mirrored in the [QPIM]) is that these
     extensions will be standardized in a separate draft in future.
     The policy framework group is currently focussed on defining the
     QoS information model to flush out the constructs before using
     them in other functional areas.
     The IP VPN information model is an attempt to satisfy the more
     immediate requirements of the IP VPN technology vendors keeping in
     mind the goals of the [QPIM]. This draft will try to track the
     changes being made to the [QPIM] wherever appropriate. This will
     ensure a parallel evolution of the IP VPN information model on the
     lines of the [QPIM].

8. Extending the IP VPN information model

     The IP VPN information model can be extended to adapt to the
     changing landscape of technologies and classification criteria.
     The important areas, which are most likely to see extensions, are
     listed below.
        1. PolicyAction[PCIM]
           The policy action class will be extended to include new
           functionality being addressed in the service provider
           requirements for IP VPNs.
           These extensions could extend from the action classes
           defined in this document if they fit within the action
           categories identified by the policy actions defined in this
           document.
        2. IpvpnApplicationSignatureValue(this document)
           The application signature value class could be extended to
           satisfy requirements of new applications to be supported
           within IP VPNs , e.g. SLA support for a new VOIP application
           schemes of identifying a network as well as new
           applications.           The Application tag is an abstract class and needs to be
           extended with protocol specific filters
     The IP VPN policy information model supports the currently known
     IP VPN services namely connectivity, security and QoS. The IP VPN
     Policy Information model can be extended to support new network
     requirements generated as a result of new network functions and
     the corresponding IP VPN services.

9. Security Considerations

   This document does not raise any new security considerations beyond
   the ones existing in the [PCIM].
