<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document analyses the state of the Internet domain-based routing
      system, concentrating on Inter-Domain Routing (IDR) and also considering
      the relationship between inter-domain and intra-domain routing. The
      analysis is carried out with respect to RFC 1126 and other IDR
      requirements and design efforts looking at the routing system as it
      appeared to be in 2001 with editorial additions reflecting developments
      up to 2006. It is the companion document to "A Set of Possible
      Requirements for a Future Routing Architecture" <a class='info' href='#I-D.irtf-routing-reqs'>[I&#8209;D.irtf&#8209;routing&#8209;reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Doria, A., Davies, E., and F. Kastenholz, &ldquo;A Set of Possible Requirements for a Future Routing Architecture,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, which is a discussion of
      requirements for the future routing architecture, addressing systems
      developments and future routing protocols. This document summarizes
      discussions held several years ago by members of the IRTF Routing
      Research Group (IRTF RRG) and other interested parties. The document is
      published with the support of the IRTF RRG as a record of the work
      completed at that time, but with the understanding that it does not
      necessarily represent either the latest technical understanding or the
      technical concensus of the research group at the date of
      publication.</p>

Provenance of this Document</h3>

<p>In 2001, the IRTF Routing Research Group (IRTF RRG) chairs, Abha
      Ahuja and Sean Doran, decided to establish a sub-group to look at
      requirements for inter-domain routing (IDR). A group of well known
      routing experts was assembled to develop requirements for a new routing
      architecture. Their mandate was to approach the problem starting from a
      blank sheet. This group was free to take any approach, including a
      revolutionary approach, in developing requirements for solving the
      problems they saw in inter-domain routing. Their eventual approach
      documented requirements for a complete future routing and addressing
      architecture rather than just the requirements for IDR.
</p>
<p>Simultaneously, an independent effort was started in Sweden with a
      similar goal. A team, calling itself Babylon, with participation from
      vendors, service providers, and academia, assembled to understand the
      history of inter-domain routing, to research the problems seen by the
      service providers, and to develop a proposal of requirements for a
      follow-on to the current routing architecture. This group's approach
      required an evolutionary approach starting from current routing
      architecture and practice. In other words the group limited itself to
      developing an evolutionary strategy and consequently assumed that the
      architecture would probably remain domain-based. The Babylon group was
      later folded into the IRTF RRG as Sub-group B to distinguish it from the
      original RRG Sub-group A.
</p>
<p>This document, which was a part of Sub-group B's output, provides a
      snapshot of the current state of Inter-Domain Routing (IDR) at the time
      of original writing (2001) with some minor updates to take into account
      developments since that date, bringing it up to date in 2006. The
      development of the new requirements set is then motivated by an analysis
      of the problems that IDR has been encountering in the recent past. This
      document is intended as a counterpart to the Routing Requirements
      document ("A Set of Possible Requirements for a Future Routing
      Architecture") which documents the requirements for future routing
      systems as captured separately by the IRTF RRG Sub-groups A and B <a class='info' href='#I-D.irtf-routing-reqs'>[I&#8209;D.irtf&#8209;routing&#8209;reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Doria, A., Davies, E., and F. Kastenholz, &ldquo;A Set of Possible Requirements for a Future Routing Architecture,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The IRTF RRG supported publication of this document as a historical
      record of the work completed on the understanding that it does not
      necessarily represent either the latest technical understanding or the
      technical consensus of the research group at the time of publication.
      The document has had substantial review by members of the Babylon team,
      members of the IRTF RRG and others over the years.

Introduction</h3>

<p>For the greater part of its existence the Internet has used a
      domain-oriented routing system whereby the routers and other nodes
      making up the infrastructure are partitioned into a set of
      administrative domains, primarily along ownership lines. Individual
      routing domains (also known as Autonomous Systems (ASs)), which maybe a
      subset of an adminitrative domain, are made up of a finite, connected
      set of nodes (at least in normal operation). Each routing domain is
      subject to a coherent set of routing and other policies managed by a
      single administrative authority. The domains are interlinked to form the
      greater Internet producing a very large network: in practice, we have to
      treat this network as if it were infinite in extent as there is no
      central knowledge about the whole network of domains. An early
      presentation of the concept of routing domains can be found Paul
      Francis' OSI routing architecture paper from 1987 <a class='info' href='#Tsuchiya87'>[Tsuchiya87]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Tsuchiya, P., &ldquo;An Architecture for Network-Layer Routing in OSI,&rdquo; 1987.</span><span>)</span></a> (Paul Francis was formerly known as Paul
      Tsuchiya).
</p>
<p>The domain concept and domain-oriented routing has become so
      fundamental to Internet routing thinking that it is generally taken as
      an axiom these days and not even defined again (c.f., <a class='info' href='#NewArch03'>[NewArch03]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Clark, D., Sollins, K., Wroclawski, J., Katabi, D., Kulik, J., Yang, X., Braden, R., Faber, T., Falk, A., Pingali, V., Handley, M., and N. Chiappa, &ldquo;New Arch: Future Generation Internet Architecture,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>). The issues discussed in the present
      document notwithstanding, it has proved to be a robust and successful
      architectural concept that brings with it the possibility of using
      different routing mechanisms and protocols within the domains
      (intra-domain) and between the domains (inter-domain). This is an
      attractive division, because intra-domain protocols can exploit the
      well-known finite scope of the domain and the mutual trust engendered by
      shared ownership to give a high degree of control to the domain
      administrators, whereas inter-domain routing lives in an essentially
      infinite region featuring a climate of distrust built on a multtude of
      competitive commercial agreements and driven by less-than-fully public
      policies from each component domain. Of course, like any other
      assumption that has been around for a very long time, the domain concept
      should be reevaluated to make sure that it is still helping!
</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that there are major shortcomings in the
      inter-domain routing of the Internet today and that these may result in
      severe routing problems within an unspecified period of time. Remedying
      these shortcomings will require extensive research to tie down the exact
      failure modes that lead to these shortcomings and identify the best
      techniques to remedy the situation. Comparatively, intra-domain routing
      works satisfactorily, and issues with intra-domain routing are mainly
      associated with the interface between intra- and inter-domain
      routing.</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Reviewer's Note: Even in 2001, there was a wide difference of
          opinion across the community regarding the shortcomings of
          interdomain routing. In the years between writing and publication,
          further analysis, changes in operational practice, alterations to
          the demands made on inter-domain routing, modifications made to BGP
          and a recognition of the difficulty of finding a replacement may
          have altered the views of some members of the community.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Changes in the nature and quality of the services that users want
      from the Internet are difficult to provide within the current framework,
      as they impose requirements never foreseen by the original architects of
      the Internet routing system.
</p>

Background</h3>

<p>Today's Internet uses an addressing and routing structure that has
        developed in an ad hoc, more or less upwards-compatible fashion. The
        structure has progressed from supporting a non-commercial Internet
        with a single administrative domain to a solution that is able to
        control today's multi-domain, federated Internet, carrying traffic
        between the networks of commercial, governmental and not-for-profit
        participants. This is not achieved without a great deal of 24/7
        vigilance and operational activity by network operators: Internet
        routing often appears to be running close to the limits of stability.
        As well as directing traffic to its intended end-point, inter-domain
        routing mechanisms are expected to implement a host of domain specific
        routing policies for competing, communicating domains. The result is
        not ideal, particularly as regards inter-domain routing mechanisms,
        but it does a pretty fair job at its primary goal of providing
        any-to-any connectivity to many millions of computers.
</p>
<p>Based on a large body of anecdotal evidence, but also on a growing
        body of experimental evidence <a class='info' href='#Labovitz02'>[Labovitz02]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Labovitz, C., Ahuja, A., Farnam, J., and A. Bose, &ldquo;Experimental Measurement of Delayed Convergence,&rdquo; 2002.</span><span>)</span></a> and
        analytic work on the stability of BGP under certain policy
        specifications <a class='info' href='#Griffin99'>[Griffin99]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Griffin, T. and G. Wilfong, &ldquo;An Analysis of BGP Convergence Properties,&rdquo; 1999.</span><span>)</span></a>, the main Internet
        inter-domain routing protocol, BGP version 4 (BGP-4), appears to have
        a number of problems. These problems are discussed in more detail in
        <a class='info' href='#problems'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Existing problems of BGP and the current Inter-/Intra-Domain Architecture</span><span>)</span></a>. Additionally, the hierarchical nature
        of the inter-domain routing problem appears to be changing as the
        connectivity between domains becomes increasingly meshed <a class='info' href='#RFC3221'>[RFC3221]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huston, G., &ldquo;Commentary on Inter-Domain Routing in the Internet,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> which alters some of the scaling and
        structuring assumptions on which BGP-4 is built. Patches and fix-ups
        may relieve some of these problems but others may require a new
        architecture and new protocols.

<blockquote class="text">
<p>Editors' Note: When this document was reviewed by Yakov
            Rekhter, one of the designers of BGP, his view was that "While
            some people expected a set of requirements outlined in RFC1126 to
            guide the development of BGP, in reality the development of BGP
            happened completely independently of RFC1126. In other words, from
            the point of view of the development of BGP, RFC1126 turned out to
            be totally irrelevant." On the other hand, it appears that BGP as
            currently implemented has met a large proportion of these
            requirements, especially for unicast traffic.

            routing in particular has been achieved and must not be undone by

ISO OSI IDRP, BGP and the Development of Policy Routing</h3>

<p>During the decade before the widespread success of the World Wide
        Web, ISO was developing the communications architecture and protocol
        suite Open Systems Interconnection (OSI). For a considerable part of
        this time OSI was seen as a possible competitor for and even a
        replacement for the IP suite as this basis for the Internet. The
        technical developments of the two protocols were quite heavily
        interrelated with each providing ideas and even components that were
        adapted into the other suite.
</p>
<p>During the early stages of the development of OSI, the IP suite was
        still mainly in use on the ARPANET and the relatively small scale
        first phase NSFnet. This was effectively a single administrative
        domain with a simple tree structured network in a three level
        hierarchy connected to a single logical exchange point (the NSFnet
        backbone). In the second half of the 1980s the NSFNET was starting on
        the growth and transformation that would lead to today's Internet. It
        was becoming clear that the backbone routing protocol, the Exterior
        Gateway Protocol (EGP) <a class='info' href='#RFC0904'>[RFC0904]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mills, D., &ldquo;Exterior Gateway Protocol formal specification,&rdquo; April&nbsp;1984.</span><span>)</span></a>, was not going
        to cope even with the limited expansion being planned. EGP is an "all
        informed" protocol which needed to know the identities of all gateways
        and this was no longer reasonable. With the increasing complexity of
        the NSFnet and the linkage of the NSFnet network to other networks
        there was a desire for policy-based routing which would allow
        administrators to manage the flow of packets between networks. The
        first version of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP-1) <a class='info' href='#RFC1105'>[RFC1105]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lougheed, K. and J. Rekhter, &ldquo;Border Gateway Protocol (BGP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;1989.</span><span>)</span></a> was developed as a replacement for EGP with
        policy capabilities - a stopgap EGP version 3 had been created as an
        interim measure while BGP was developed. BGP was designed to work on a
        hierarchically structured network, such as the original NSFNET, but
        could also work on networks that were at least partially
        non-hierarchical where there were links between ASs at the same level
        in the hierarchy (we would now call these 'peering arrangements')
        although the protocol made a distinction between different kinds of
        links (links are classified as upwards, downwards or sideways). ASs
        themselves were a 'fix' for the complexity that developed in the three
        tier structure of the NSFnet.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the OSI architects, led by Lyman Chapin, were developing
        a much more general architecture for large scale networks. They had
        recognized that no one node, especially an end-system (host) could or
        should attempt to remember routes from "here" to "anywhere" - this
        sounds obvious today but was not so obvious 20 years ago. They were
        also considering hierarchical networks with independently administered
        domains - a model already well entrenched in the public switched
        telephone network. This led to a vision of a network with multiple
        independent administrative domains with an arbitrary interconnection
        graph and a hierarchy of routing functionality. This architecture was
        fairly well established by 1987 <a class='info' href='#Tsuchiya87'>[Tsuchiya87]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Tsuchiya, P., &ldquo;An Architecture for Network-Layer Routing in OSI,&rdquo; 1987.</span><span>)</span></a>. The
        architecture initially envisaged a three level routing functionality
        hierarchy in which each layer had significantly different
        characteristics:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol class="text">
<li><strong>End-system to Intermediate system routing
            (host to router)</strong>, in which the principal functions are
            discovery and redirection.<br />
<br />

</li>
<li><strong>Intra-domain intermediate system to
            intermediate system routing (router to router)</strong>, in which
            "best" routes between end-systems in a single administrative
            domain are computed and used. A single algorithm and routing
            protocol would be used throughout any one domain.<br />
<br />

</li>
<li><strong>Inter-domain intermediate-system to
            intermediate system routing (router to router)</strong>, in which
            routes between routing domains within administrative domains are
            computed (routing is considered separately between administrative
            domains and routing domains).
</li>
</ol>

<p>Level 3 of this hierarchy was still somewhat fuzzy. Tsuchiya
        says:<br />
<br />
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>The last two components, Inter-Domain and Inter-Administration
            routing, are less clear-cut. It is not obvious what should be
            standardized with respect to these two components of routing. For
            example, for Inter-Domain routing, what can be expected from the
            Domains? By asking Domains to provide some kind of external
            behavior, we limit their autonomy. If we expect nothing of their
            external behavior, then routing functionality will be
            minimal.<br />
<br />

</p>
<p>Across administrations, it is not known how much trust there
            will be. In fact, the definition of trust itself can only be
            determined by the two or more administrations involved.<br />
<br />

</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the problem with Inter-Domain and
            Inter-Administration routing is that autonomy and mistrust are
            both antithetical to routing. Accomplishing either will involve a
            number of tradeoffs which will require more knowledge about the
            environments within which they will operate.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further refinement of the model occurred over the next couple of
        years and a more fully formed view is given by Huitema and Dabbous in
        1989 <a class='info' href='#Huitema90'>[Huitema90]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huitema, C. and W. Dabbous, &ldquo;Routeing protocols development in the OSI           architecture,&rdquo; 1990.</span><span>)</span></a>. By this stage work on the
        original IS-IS link state protocol, originated by the Digital
        Equipment Corporation (DEC), was fairly advanced and was close to
        becoming a Draft International Standard. IS-IS is of course a major
        component of intra-domain routing today and inspired the development
        of the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) family. However, Huitema and
        Dabbous were not able to give any indication of protocol work for
        Level 3. There are hints of possible use of centralized route
        servers.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, the NSFnet consortium and the IETF had been
        struggling with the rapid growth of the NSFnet. It had been clear
        since fairly early on that EGP was not suitable for handling the
        expanding network and the race was on to find a replacement. There had
        been some intent to include a metric in EGP to facilitate routing
        decisions, but no agreement could be reached on how to define the
        metric. The lack of trust was seen as one of the main reasons that EGP
        could not establish a globally acceptable routing metric: again this
        seems to be a clearly futile aim from this distance in time!
        Consequently EGP became effectively a rudimentary path-vector protocol
        which linked gateways with Autonomous Systems. It was totally reliant
        on the tree structured network to avoid routing loops and the all
        informed nature of EGP meant that update packets became very large.
        BGP version 1 <a class='info' href='#RFC1105'>[RFC1105]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lougheed, K. and J. Rekhter, &ldquo;Border Gateway Protocol (BGP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;1989.</span><span>)</span></a> was standardized in 1989
        but had been in development for some time before this and had already
        seen action in production networks prior to standardization. BGP was
        the first real path-vector routing protocol and was intended to
        relieve some of the scaling problems as well as providing policy-based
        routing. Routes were described as paths along a 'vector' of ASs
        without any associated cost metric. This way of describing routes was
        explicitly intended to allow detection of routing loops. It was
        assumed that the intra-domain routing system was loop-free with the
        implication that the total routing system would be loop-free if there
        were no loops in the AS path. Note that there were no theoretical
        underpinnings for this work and it traded freedom from routing loops
        for guaranteed convergence.
</p>
<p>Also the NSFnet was a government funded research and education
        network. Commercial companies which were partners in some of the
        projects were using the NSFnet for their research activities but it
        was becoming clear that these companies also needed networks for
        commercial traffic. NSFnet had put in place "acceptable use" policies
        which were intended to limit the use of the network. However there was
        little or no technology to support the legal framework.
</p>
<p>Practical experience, IETF IAB discussion (centred in the Internet
        Architecture Task Force) and the OSI theoretical work were by now
        coming to the same conclusions:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Networks were going to be composed out of multiple
            administrative domains (the federated network),
</li>
<li>The connections between these domains would be an arbitrary
            graph and certainly not a tree,
</li>
<li>The administrative domains would wish to establish distinctive,
            independent routing policies through the graph of Autonomous
            Systems, and
</li>
<li>Administrative Domains would have a degree of distrust of each
            other which would mean that policies would remain opaque.
</li>
</ul>

<p>These views were reflected by Susan Hares' (working for Merit
        Networks at that time) contribution to the Internet Architecture
        (INARC) workshop in 1989, summarized in the report of the workshop
        <a class='info' href='#INARC89'>[INARC89]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mills, D., Ed. and M. Davis, Ed., &ldquo;Internet Architecture Workshop: Future of the Internet System           Architecture and TCP/IP Protocols - Report,&rdquo; 1990.</span><span>)</span></a>:<br />

<p>The rich interconnectivity within the Internet causes routing
            problems today. However, the presenter believes the problem is not
            the high degree of interconnection, but the routing protocols and
            models upon which these protocols are based. Rich
            interconnectivity can provide redundancy which can help packets
            moving even through periods of outages. Our model of interdomain
            routing needs to change. The model of autonomous confederations

            networking protocols while still continuing to serve its users.
            This reality colors how plans are made to change routing
            protocols.

<p>It is also interesting to note that the difficulties of organising
        a transition were recognized at this stage and have not been seriously
        explored or resolved since.
</p>
<p>Policies would primarily be interested in controlling which traffic
        should be allowed to transit a domain (to satisfy commercial
        constraints or acceptable use policies) thereby controlling which
        traffic uses the resources of the domain. The solution adopted by both
        the IETF and OSI was a form of distance vector hop-by-hop routing with
        explicit policy terms. The reasoning for this choice can be found in
        Breslau and Estrin's 1990 paper <a class='info' href='#Breslau90'>[Breslau90]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Breslau, L. and D. Estrin, &ldquo;An Architecture for Network-Layer Routing in OSI,&rdquo; 1990.</span><span>)</span></a>
        (implicitly - because some other alternatives are given such as a link
        state with policy suggestion which, with hindsight, would have even
        greater problems than BGP on a global scale network). Traditional
        distance vector protocols exchanged routing information in the form of
        a destination and a metric. The new protocols explicitly associated
        policy expressions with the route by including either a list of the
        source ASs that are permitted to use the route described in the
        routing update, and/or a list of all ASs traversed along the
        advertised route.
</p>
<p>Parallel protocol developments were already in progress by the time
        this paper was published: BGP version 2 <a class='info' href='#RFC1163'>[RFC1163]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lougheed, K. and Y. Rekhter, &ldquo;Border Gateway Protocol (BGP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;1990.</span><span>)</span></a>
        in the IETF and the Inter-Domain Routing Protocol (IDRP) <a class='info' href='#ISO10747'>[ISO10747]<span> (</span><span class='info'>ISO/IEC, &ldquo;Protocol for Exchange of Inter-Domain Routeing Information           among Intermediate Systems to support Forwarding of ISO 8473           PDUs,&rdquo; 1993.</span><span>)</span></a> which would be the Level 3 routing protocol
        for the OSI architecture. IDRP was developed under the aegis of the
        ANSI XS3.3 working group led by Lyman Chapin and Charles Kunzinger.
        The two protocols were very similar in basic design but IDRP has some
        extra features, some of which have been incorporated into later
        versions of BGP; others may yet be so and still others may be seen to
        be inappropriate. Breslau and Estrin summarize the design of IDRP as
        follows:<br />
<br />
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>IDRP attempts to solve the looping and convergence problems
            inherent in distance vector routing by including full AD
            [Administrative Domain - essentially the equivalent of what are
            now called ASs] path information in routing updates. Each routing
            update includes the set of ADs that must be traversed in order to
            reach the specified destination. In this way, routes that contain
            AD loops can be avoided.<br />
<br />

</p>
<p>IDRP updates also contain additional information relevant to
            policy constraints. For instance, these updates can specify what
            other ADs are allowed to receive the information described in the
            update. In this way, IDRP is able to express source specific
            policies. The IDRP protocol also provides the structure for the
            addition of other types of policy related information in routing
            updates. For example, User Class Identifiers (UCI) could also be
            included as policy attributes in routing updates.<br />
<br />

</p>
<p>Using the policy route attributes IDRP provides the framework
            for expressing more fine grained policy in routing decisions.
            However, because it uses hop-by-hop distance vector routing, it
            only allows a single route to each destination per-QOS to be
            advertised. As the policy attributes associated with routes become
            more fine grained, advertised routes will be applicable to fewer
            sources. This implies a need for multiple routes to be advertised
            for each destination in order to increase the probability that
            sources have acceptable routes available to them. This effectively
            replicates the routing table per forwarding entity for each QoS,
            UCI, source combination that might appear in a packet.
            Consequently, we claim that this approach does not scale well as
            policies become more fine grained, i.e., source or UCI specific
            policies.

<p>Over the next three or four years successive versions of BGP (BGP-2
        <a class='info' href='#RFC1163'>[RFC1163]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lougheed, K. and Y. Rekhter, &ldquo;Border Gateway Protocol (BGP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;1990.</span><span>)</span></a>, BGP-3 <a class='info' href='#RFC1267'>[RFC1267]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lougheed, K. and Y. Rekhter, &ldquo;Border Gateway Protocol 3 (BGP-3),&rdquo; October&nbsp;1991.</span><span>)</span></a>
        and BGP-4 <a class='info' href='#RFC1771'>[RFC1771]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rekhter, Y. and T. Li, &ldquo;A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4),&rdquo; March&nbsp;1995.</span><span>)</span></a>) were deployed to cope with
        the growing and by now commercialized Internet. From BGP-2 onwards,
        BGP made no assumptions about an overall structure of interconnections
        allowing it to cope with today's dense web of interconnections between
        ASs. BGP version 4 was developed to handle the change from classful to
        classless addressing. For most of this time IDRP was being developed
        in parallel, and both protocols were implemented in the Merit
        gatedaemon routing protocol suite. During this time there was a
        movement within the IETF which saw BGP as a stopgap measure to be used
        until the more sophisticated IDRP could be adapted to run over IP
        instead of the OSI connectionless protocol CLNP. However, unlike its
        intra-domain counterpart IS-IS which has stood the test of time, and
        indeed proved to be more flexible than OSPF, IDRP was ultimately not
        adopted by the market. By the time the NSFnet backbone was
        decommissioned in 1995, BGP-4 was the inter-domain routing protocol of
        choice and OSI's star was already beginning to wane. IDRP is now
        little remembered.
</p>
<p>A more complete account of the capabilities of IDRP can be found in
        chapter 14 of David Piscitello and Lyman Chapin's book 'Open Systems
        Networking: TCP/IP and OSI' which is now readable on the Internet
        <a class='info' href='#Chapin94'>[Chapin94]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Piscitello, D. and A. Chapin, &ldquo;Open Systems Networking: TCP/IP &amp; OSI,&rdquo; 1994.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>IDRP also contained quite extensive means for securing routing
        exchanges much of it based on X.509 certificates for each router and
        public/private key encryption of routing updates.
</p>
<p>Some of the capabilities of IDRP which might yet appear in a future
        version of BGP include the ability to manage routes with explicit QoS
        classes, and the concept of domain confederations (somewhat different
        from the confederation mechanism in today's BGP) as an extra level in
        the hierarchy of routing.

Nimrod Requirements</h3>

<p>Nimrod as expressed by Noel Chiappa in his early document, "A New
        IP Routing and Addressing Architecture" <a class='info' href='#Chiappa91'>[Chiappa91]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Chiappa, N., &ldquo;A New IP Routing and Addressing Architecture,&rdquo; 1991.</span><span>)</span></a> and later in the NIMROD Working Group
        documents <a class='info' href='#RFC1753'>[RFC1753]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Chiappa, J., &ldquo;IPng Technical Requirements Of the Nimrod Routing and Addressing Architecture,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1994.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#RFC1992'>[RFC1992]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Castineyra, I., Chiappa, N., and M. Steenstrup, &ldquo;The Nimrod Routing Architecture,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> established a number of requirements that
        need to be considered by any new routing architecture. The Nimrod
        requirements took RFC1126 as a starting point and went further.
</p>
<p>The three goals of Nimrod, quoted from <a class='info' href='#RFC1992'>[RFC1992]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Castineyra, I., Chiappa, N., and M. Steenstrup, &ldquo;The Nimrod Routing Architecture,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a>, were as follows:</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>To support a dynamic internetwork of <em>arbitrary
            size</em> (our emphasis) by providing mechanisms to control the
            amount of routing information that must be known throughout an
            internetwork.
</li>
<li>To provide service-specific routing in the presence of multiple
            constraints imposed by service providers and users.
</li>
<li>To admit incremental deployment throughout an internetwork.
</li>
</ol>

<p>It is certain that these goals should be considered requirements
        for any new domain-based routing architecture. </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>As discussed in other sections of this document the rate of
            growth of the amount of information needed to maintain the routing
            system is such that the system may not be able to scale up as the
            Internet expands as foreseen. And yet, as the services and
            constraints upon those services grow there is a need for more
            information to be maintained by the routing system. One of the key
            terms in the first requirements is 'control'. While increasing
            amounts of information need to be known and maintained in the
            Internet, the amounts and kinds of information that are
            distributed can be controlled. This goal should be reflected in
            the requirements for the future domain-based architecture.
</li>
<li>If anything, the demand for specific services in the Internet
            has grown since 1996 when the Nimrod architecture was published.
            Additionally the kinds of constraints that service providers need
            to impose upon their networks and that services need to impose
            upon the routing have also increased. Any changes made to the
            network in the last half-decade have not significantly improved
            this situation.
</li>
<li>The ability to incrementally deploy any new routing
            architecture within the Internet is still an absolute necessity.
            It is impossible to imagine that a new routing architecture could
            supplant the current architecture on a flag day.
</li>
</ul>

<p>At one point in time Nimrod, with its addressing and routing
        architectures was seen as a candidate for IPng. History shows that it
        was not accepted as the IPng, having been ruled out of the selection
        process by the IESG in 1994 on the grounds that it was 'too much of a
        research effort' <a class='info' href='#RFC1752'>[RFC1752]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S. and A. Mankin, &ldquo;The Recommendation for the IP Next Generation Protocol,&rdquo; January&nbsp;1995.</span><span>)</span></a>, although input for
        the requirements of IPng was explicitly solicited from Chiappa <a class='info' href='#RFC1753'>[RFC1753]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Chiappa, J., &ldquo;IPng Technical Requirements Of the Nimrod Routing and Addressing Architecture,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1994.</span><span>)</span></a>. Instead IPv6 has been put forth as the IPng.
        Without entering a discussion of the relative merits of IPv6 versus
        Nimrod, it is apparent that IPv6, while it may solve many problems,
        does not solve the critical routing problems in the Internet today. In
        fact in some sense it exacerbates them by adding a requirement for
        support of two Internet protocols and their respective addressing
        methods. In many ways the addition of IPv6 to the mix of methods in
        today's Internet only points to the fact that the goals, as set forth
        by the Nimrod team, remain as necessary goals.
</p>
<p>There is another sense in which study of Nimrod and its
        architecture may be important to deriving a future domain-based
        routing architecture. Nimrod can be said to have two derivatives:
        </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) in that it took the
            notion of forwarding along well known paths
</li>
<li>Private Network-Node Interface (PNNI) in that it took the
            notion of abstracting topological information and using that
            information to create connections for traffic.
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note, that whilst MPLS and PNNI borrowed ideas
        from Nimrod, neither of them can be said to be an implementation of
        this architecture.

PNNI</h3>

<p>The Private Network-Node Interface (PNNI) routing protocol was
        developed under the ATM Forum's auspices as a hierarchical route
        determination protocol for ATM, a connection oriented architecture. It
        is reputed to have developed several of its methods from a study of
        the Nimrod architecture. What can be gained from an analysis of what
        did and did not succeed in PNNI?
</p>
<p>The PNNI protocol includes the assumption that all peer groups are
        willing to cooperate, and that the entire network is under the same
        top administration. Are there limitations that stem from this 'world
        node' presupposition? As discussed in <a class='info' href='#RFC3221'>[RFC3221]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huston, G., &ldquo;Commentary on Inter-Domain Routing in the Internet,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>,
        the Internet is no longer a clean hierarchy and there is a lot of
        resistance to having any sort of 'ultimate authority' controlling or
        even brokering communication.
</p>
<p>PNNI is the first deployed example of a routing protocol that uses
        abstract map exchange (as opposed to distance vector or link state
        mechanisms) for inter-domain routing information exchange. One
        consequence of this is that domains need not all use the same
        mechanism for map creation. What were the results of this abstraction
        and source based route calculation mechanism?
</p>
<p>Since the authors of this document do not have experience running a
        PNNI network, the comments above are from a theoretical perspective.
        Further research on these issues based on operational experience is
        required.

Developments in Internet Connectivity</h3>

<p>The work commissioned from Geoff Huston by the Internet
        Architecture Board <a class='info' href='#RFC3221'>[RFC3221]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huston, G., &ldquo;Commentary on Inter-Domain Routing in the Internet,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> draws a number of
        conclusions from analysis of BGP routing tables and routing registry
        databases: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The connectivity between provider ASs is becoming more like a
            dense mesh than the tree structure that was commonly assumed to be
            commonplace a couple of years ago. This has been driven by the
            increasing amounts charged for peering and transit traffic by
            global service providers. Local direct peering and Internet
            exchanges are becoming steadily more common as the cost of local
            fibre connections drops.
</li>
<li>End user sites are increasingly resorting to multi-homing onto
            two or more service providers as a way of improving resiliency.
            This has a knock-on effect of spectacularly fast depletion of the
            available pool of AS numbers as end user sites require public AS
            numbers to become multi-homed and corresponding increase in the
            number of prefixes advertised in BGP.
</li>
<li>Multi-homed sites are using advertisement of longer prefixes in
            BGP as a means of traffic engineering to load spread across their
            multiple external connections with further impact on the size of
            the BGP tables.
</li>
<li>Operational practices are not uniform, and in some cases lack
            of knowledge or training is leading to instability and/or
            excessive advertisement of routes by incorrectly configured BGP
            speakers.
</li>
<li>All these factors are quickly negating the advantages in
            limiting the expansion of BGP routing tables that were gained by
            the introduction of CIDR and consequent prefix aggregation in BGP.
            It is also now impossible for IPv6 to realize the world view in
            which the default free zone would be limited to perhaps 10,000
            prefixes.
</li>
<li>The typical 'width' of the Internet in AS hops is now around
            five, and much less in many cases.
</li>
</ul>

<p>These conclusions have a considerable impact on the requirements
        for the future domain-based routing architecture: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Topological hierarchy (e.g. mandating a tree structured
            connectivity) cannot be relied upon to deliver scalability of a
            large Internet routing system
</li>
<li>Aggregation cannot be relied upon to constrain the size of
            routing tables for an all-informed routing system
</li>

DARPA NewArch Project</h3>

<p>DARPA funded a project to think about a new architecture for future
        generation Internet, called NewArch (<a href='http://www.isi.edu/newarch/'>http://www.isi.edu/newarch/</a>). Work started in the
        first half of 2000 and the main project finished in 2003 <a class='info' href='#NewArch03'>[NewArch03]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Clark, D., Sollins, K., Wroclawski, J., Katabi, D., Kulik, J., Yang, X., Braden, R., Faber, T., Falk, A., Pingali, V., Handley, M., and N. Chiappa, &ldquo;New Arch: Future Generation Internet Architecture,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The main development is to conclude that as the Internet becomes
        mainstream infrastructure, fewer and fewer of the requirements are
        truly global but may apply with different force or not at all in
        certain parts of the network. This (it is claimed) makes the
        compilation of a single, ordered list of requirements deeply
        problematic. Instead we may have to produce multiple requirement sets
        with support for differing requirement importance at different times
        and in different places. This 'meta-requirement' significantly impacts
        architectural design.
</p>
<p>Potential new technical requirements identified so far include:
        </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Commercial environment concerns such as richer inter-provider
            policy controls and support for a variety of payment models
</li>
<li>Trustworthiness
</li>
<li>Ubiquitous mobility
</li>
<li>Policy driven self-organisation ('deep auto configuration')
</li>
<li>Extreme short-timescale resource variability
</li>
<li>Capacity allocation mechanisms
</li>
<li>Speed, propagation delay and delay/bandwidth product issues
</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-technical or political 'requirements' include: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Legal and Policy drivers such as 
<ul class="text">
<li>Privacy and free/anonymous speech
</li>
<li>Intellectual property concerns
</li>
<li>Encryption export controls

<li>Law enforcement surveillance regulations

Defending the End-to-End Principle</h3>

<p>One of the participants in DARPA NewArch work (Dave Clark) with
          one of his associates has also published a very interesting paper
          analyzing the impact of some of the new requirements identified in
          NewArch (see <a class='info' href='#new-arch'>Section&nbsp;4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>DARPA NewArch Project</span><span>)</span></a>) on the end-to-end
          principle that has guided the development of the Internet to date
          <a class='info' href='#Blumenthal01'>[Blumenthal01]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Blumenthal, M. and D. Clark, &ldquo;Rethinking the design of the Internet: The end to end           arguments vs,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>. Their primary conclusion is
          that the loss of trust between the users at the ends of end to end
          has the most fundamental effect on the Internet. This is clear in
          the context of the routing system, where operators are unwilling to
          reveal the inner workings of their networks for commercial reasons.
          Similarly, trusted third parties and their avatars (mainly mid-boxes
          of one sort or another) have a major impact on the end-to-end
          principles and the routing mechanisms that went with them. Overall,
          the end to end principles should be defended so far as is possible -
          some changes are already too deeply embedded to make it possible to
          go back to full trust and openness - at least partly as a means of
          staving off the day when the network will ossify into an
          unchangeable form and function (much as the telephone network has
          done). The hope is that by that time a new Internet will appear to
          offer a context for unfettered innovation.

Existing problems of BGP and the current Inter-/Intra-Domain Architecture</h3>

<p>Although most of the people who have to work with BGP today believe
      it to be a useful, working protocol, discussions have brought to light a
      number of areas where BGP or the relationship between BGP and the
      intra-domain routing protocols in use today could be improved. BGP-4 has
      been and continues to be extended since it was originally introduced in
      <a class='info' href='#RFC1771'>[RFC1771]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rekhter, Y. and T. Li, &ldquo;A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4),&rdquo; March&nbsp;1995.</span><span>)</span></a> and the protocol as deployed has been

      large extent, a wish list for the future domain-based routing
      architecture based on those areas where BGP is seen to be lacking,
      rather than simply a list of problems with BGP. The shortcomings of
      today's inter-domain routing system have also been extensively surveyed

BGP and Auto-aggregation</h3>

<p>The initial stability followed by linear growth rates of the number
        of routing objects (prefixes) that was achieved by the introduction of
        CIDR around 1994, has now been once again been replaced by
        near-exponential growth of number of routing objects. The granularity
        of many of the objects advertised in the default free zone is very
        small (prefix length of 22 or longer): This granularity appears to be
        a by-product of attempts to perform precision traffic engineering
        related to increasing levels of multi-homing. At present there is no
        mechanism in BGP that would allow an AS to aggregate such prefixes
        without advance knowledge of their existence, even if it was possible
        to deduce automatically that they could be aggregated. Achieving
        satisfactory auto-aggregation would also significantly reduce the
        non-locality problems associated with instability in peripheral
        ASs.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it may be that alterations to the connectivity
        of the net as described in <a class='info' href='#RFC3221'>[RFC3221]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huston, G., &ldquo;Commentary on Inter-Domain Routing in the Internet,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> and Section
        2.5.1 may limit the usefulness of auto-aggregation.

<a name="rfc.section.5.2"></a><h3>5.2.&nbsp;
Convergence and Recovery Issues</h3>

<p>BGP today is a stable protocol under most circumstances but this
        has been achieved at the expense of making the convergence time of the
        inter-domain routing system very slow under some conditions. This has
        a detrimental effect on the recovery of the network from failures.
</p>
<p>The timers that control the behavior of BGP are typically set to
        values in the region of several tens of seconds to a few minutes,
        which constrains the responsiveness of BGP to failure conditions.
</p>
<p>In the early days of deployment of BGP, poor network stability and
        router software problems lead to storms of withdrawals closely
        followed by re-advertisements of many prefices. To control the load on
        routing software imposed by these "route flaps", route flap damping
        was introduced into BGP. Most operators have now implemented a degree
        of route flap damping in their deployments of BGP. This restricts the
        number of times that the routing tables will be rebuilt even if a
        route is going up and down very frequently. Unfortunately, route flap
        damping responds to multiple flaps by increasing the route suppression
        time exponentially, which can result in some parts of the Internet
        being unreachable for hours at a time.
</p>
<p>There is evidence (<a class='info' href='#RFC3221'>[RFC3221]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huston, G., &ldquo;Commentary on Inter-Domain Routing in the Internet,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> and measurements
        by some of the Sub-group B members<a class='info' href='#Jiang02'>[Jiang02]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jiang, Y., Doria, A., Olsson, D., and F. Pettersson, &ldquo;Inter-domain Routing Stability Measurement,&rdquo; 2002.</span><span>)</span></a>) that
        in today's network route flap is disproportionately associated with
        the fine grain prefices (length 22 or longer) associated with traffic
        engineering at the periphery of the network. Auto-aggregation as
        previously discussed would tend to mask such instability and prevent
        it being propagated across the whole network. Another question that
        needs to be studied is the continuing need for an architecture that
        requires global convergence. Some of our studies (unpublished) show
        that, in some localities at least, the network never actually reaches
        stability; i.e., it never really globally converges. Can a global, and
        beyond, network be designed with the requirement of global
        convergence?

Non-locality of Effects of Instability and Misconfiguration</h3>

<p>There have been a number of instances, some of which are well
        documented, of a mistake in BGP configuration in a single peripheral
        AS propagating across the whole Internet and resulting in misrouting
        of most of the traffic in the Internet.
</p>
<p>Similarly, a single route flap in a single peripheral AS can
        require route table recalculation across the entire Internet.
</p>
<p>This non-locality of effects is highly undesirable, and it would be
        a considerable improvement if such effects were naturally limited to a
        small area of the network around the problem. This is another argument
        for an architecture that does not require global convergence.

<a name="rfc.section.5.4"></a><h3>5.4.&nbsp;
Multihoming Issues</h3>

<p>As discussed previously, the increasing use of multi-homing as a
        robustness technique by peripheral networks requires that multiple
        routes have to be advertised for such domains. These routes must not
        be aggregated close in to the multi-homed domain as this would defeat
        the traffic engineering implied by multi-homing and currently cannot
        be aggregated further away from the multi-homed domain due to the lack
        of auto-aggregation capabilities. Consequentially the default free
        zone routing table is growing exponentially, as it was before
        CIDR.
</p>
<p>The longest prefix match routing technique introduced by CIDR, and
        implemented in BGP-4, when combined with provider address allocation
        is an obstacle to effective multi-homing if load sharing across the
        multiple links is required. If an AS has been allocated its addresses
        from an upstream provider, the upstream provider can aggregate those
        addresses with those of other customers and need only advertise a
        single prefix for a range of customers. But, if the customer AS is
        also connected to another provider, the second provider is not able to
        aggregate the customer addresses because they are not taken from his
        allocation, and will therefore have to announce a more specific route
        to the customer AS. The longest match rule will then direct all
        traffic through the second provider, which is not as required.

<p>In <a class='info' href='#addr-aggr'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Address Aggregation</span><span>)</span></a> AS3 has received its addresses

        to be seen equally both ways, AS3 is forced to announce both the
        aggregate and the more specific route to AS2.
</p>
<p>This problem has induced many ASs to apply for their own address
        allocation even though they could have been allocated from an upstream
        provider further exacerbating the default free zone route table size
        explosion. This problem also interferes with the desire of many
        providers in the default free zone to route only prefixes that are
        equal to or shorter than 20 or 19 bits.

<p>Note that some problems which are referred to as multihoming issues
        are not, and should not be, solvable through the routing system (e.g.,
        where a TCP load distributor is needed), and multihoming is not a

AS-number exhaustion</h3>

<p>The domain identifier or AS-number is a 16-bit number. When this
        paper was originally written in 2001, allocation of AS-numbers was
        increasing 51% a year <a class='info' href='#RFC3221'>[RFC3221]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huston, G., &ldquo;Commentary on Inter-Domain Routing in the Internet,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> and exhaustion by
        2005 was predicted. According to some recent work again by Huston
        <a class='info' href='#Huston05'>[Huston05]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huston, G., &ldquo;Exploring Autonomous System Numbers,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>, the rate of increase dropped off
        after the business downturn but as of July 2005, well over half the
        available AS numbers (39000 out of 64510) had been allocated by IANA
        and around 20000 were visible in the global BGP routing tables. A year
        later these figures had grown to 42000 (April 2006) and 23000 (August
        2006) respectively and the rate of allocation is currently about 3500
        per year. Depending on the curve fitting model used to predict when
        exhaustion will occur, the pool will run out somewhere between 2010
        and 2013. There appear to be other factors at work in this rate of
        increase beyond an increase in the number of ISPs in business,
        although there is a fair degree of correlation between these numbers.
        AS numbers are now used for a number of purposes beyond that of
        identifying large routing domains: multihomed sites acquire an AS
        number in order to express routing preferences to their various
        providers and AS numbers are used part of the addressing mechanism for
        MPLS/BGP-based virtual private networks (VPNs) <a class='info' href='#RFC4364'>[RFC4364]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosen, E. and Y. Rekhter, &ldquo;BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. The IETF has had a proposal under
        development for over four years to increase the available range of
        AS-numbers to 32 bits <a class='info' href='#RFC4893'>[RFC4893]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vohra, Q. and E. Chen, &ldquo;BGP Support for Four-octet AS Number Space,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. Much of the
        slowness in development is due to the deployment challenge during
        transition. Because of the difficulties of transition, deployment
        needs to start well in advance of actual exhaustion so that the
        network as a whole is ready for the new capability when it is needed.
        This implies that standardisation needs to be complete and
        implementations available at least well in advance of expected

Partitioned ASs</h3>

<p>Tricks with discontinuous ASs are used by operators, for example,
        to implement anycast. Discontinuous ASs may also come into being by
        chance if a multi-homed domain becomes partitioned as a result of a
        fault and part of the domain can access the Internet through each
        connection. It may be desirable to make support for this kind of
        situation more transparent than it is at present.

        size and defined granularity (seconds to tens of seconds) of the
        'keep-alive' time negotiated at start-up for each BGP connection
        constrains the responsiveness of BGP to link failures.
</p>
<p>The recommended values and the available lower limit for this timer
        were set to limit the overhead caused by keep-alive messages when link

        much higher rate of keep-alive messages without significantly
        impacting normal data traffic. This would improve responsiveness to
        link and node failures but with a corresponding increase in the risk

        forces a full exchange which could perhaps be constrained by retaining
        some state across limited time failures and using revision control,

Interaction between Inter-Domain Routing and Intra-Domain Routing</h3>

<p>Today, many operators' backbone routers run both I-BGP and an
        intra-domain protocol to maintain the routes that reach between the
        borders of the domain. Exporting routes from BGP into the intra-domain
        protocol in use and bringing them back up to BGP is not recommended
        <a class='info' href='#RFC2791'>[RFC2791]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Yu, J., &ldquo;Scalable Routing Design Principles,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>, but it is still necessary for all
        backbone routers to run both protocols. BGP is used to find the egress
        point and intra-domain protocol to find the path (next hop router) to
        the egress point across the domain. This is not only a management
        problem but may also create other problems: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>BGP is a path vector protocol (i.e., a protocol
            that uses distance metrics possibly overridden by policy metrics),
            whereas most intra-domain protocols are link state protocols. As
            such BGP is not optimised for convergence speed although distance
            vector algorithms generally require less processing power.
            Incidentally, more efficient distance vector algorithms are
            available such as <a class='info' href='#Xu97'>[Xu97]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Xu, Z., Dai, S., and J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, &ldquo;A More Efficient Distance Vector Routing Algorithm,&rdquo; Nov&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>The metrics used in BGP and the intra-domain
            protocol are rarely comparable or combinable. Whilst there are
            arguments that the optimizations inside a domain may be different
            from those for end-to-end paths, there are occasions, such as
            calculating the 'topologically nearest' server when computable or
            combinable metrics would be of assistance.
</li>
<li>The policies that can be implemented using BGP
            are designed for control of traffic exchange between operators,
            not for controlling paths within a domain. Policies for BGP are
            most conveniently expressed in Routing Policy Support Language
            (RPSL) <a class='info' href='#RFC2622'>[RFC2622]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Alaettinoglu, C., Villamizar, C., Gerich, E., Kessens, D., Meyer, D., Bates, T., Karrenberg, D., and M. Terpstra, &ldquo;Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL),&rdquo; June&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> and this could be extended
            if thought desirable to include additional policy information.
</li>
<li>If the NEXT HOP destination for a set of BGP
            routes becomes inaccessible because of intra-domain protocol
            problems, the routes using the vanished next hop have to be
            invalidated at the next available UPDATE. Subsequently, if the
            next hop route reappears, this would normally lead to the BGP
            speaker requesting a full table from its neighbour(s). Current
            implementations may attempt to circumvent the effects of
            intra-domain protocol route flap by caching the invalid routes for
            a period in case the next hop is restored through the 'graceful
            restart' mechanism.<br />
<br />

</li>
</ul><br />
<br />

</li>
<li>Synchronization between intra-domain and
            inter-domain routing information is a problem as long as we use
            different protocols for intra-domain and inter-domain routing,
            which will most probably be the case even in the future because of
            the differing requirements in the two situations. Some sort of
            synchronization between those two protocols would be useful. In
            the RFC 'IS-IS Transient Blackhole Avoidance' <a class='info' href='#RFC3277'>[RFC3277]<span> (</span><span class='info'>McPherson, D., &ldquo;Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Transient Blackhole Avoidance,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, the intra-domain protocol side of the
            story is covered (there is an equivalent discussion for OSPF).
</li>
<li>Synchronizing in BGP means waiting for the
            intra-domain protocol to know about the same networks as the
            inter-domain protocol, which can take a significant period of time
            and slows down the convergence of BGP by adding the intra-domain
            protocol convergence time into each cycle. In general operators no
            longer attempt full synchronization in order to avoid this problem
            (in general, redistributing the entire BGP routing feed into the
            local intra-domain protocol is unnecessary and undesirable but
            where a domain has multiple exits to peers and other non-customer
            networks, changes in BGP routing that affect the exit taken by
            traffic require corresponding re-routing in the intra-domain
            routing).

Policy Issues</h3>

<p>There are several classes of issues with current BGP policy: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Policy is installed in an ad-hoc manner in each
            autonomous system. There isn't a method for ensuring that the
            policy installed in one router is coherent with policies installed
            in other routers.
</li>
<li>As described in Griffin <a class='info' href='#Griffin99'>[Griffin99]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Griffin, T. and G. Wilfong, &ldquo;An Analysis of BGP Convergence Properties,&rdquo; 1999.</span><span>)</span></a> and in McPherson <a class='info' href='#RFC3345'>[RFC3345]<span> (</span><span class='info'>McPherson, D., Gill, V., Walton, D., and A.

            ASs, and instantiate them in routers, that will cause BGP to fail
            to converge in certain types of topology
</li>
<li>There is no available network model for
            describing policy in a coherent manner.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Policy management is extremely complex and mostly done without the
        aid of any automated procedures. The extreme complexity means that a
        highly qualified specialist is required for policy management of
        border routers. The training of these specialists is quite lengthy and
        needs to involve long periods of hands-on experience. There is,
        therefore, a shortage of qualified staff for installing and
        maintaining the routing policies. Because of the overall complexity of
        BGP, policy management tends to be only a relatively small topic
        within a complete BGP training course and specialised policy
        management training courses are not generally available.

Security Issues</h3>

<p>While many of the issues with BGP security have been traced either
        to implementation issues or to operational issues, BGP is vulnerable
        to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Additionally routers
        can be used as unwitting forwarders in DDoS attacks on other
        systems.
</p>
<p>Though DDoS attacks can be fought in a variety of ways, mostly
        using filtering methods, it takes constant vigilance. There is nothing
        in the current architecture or in the protocols that serves to protect
        the forwarders from these attacks.

Support of MPLS and VPNS</h3>

        this over-loading of the BGP protocol as a boon whilst others see it
        as a problem. While it was certainly convenient as a vehicle for
        vendors to deliver extra functionality for to their products, it has
        exacerbated some of the performance and complexity issues of BGP. Two
        important problems are, the additional state that must be retained and
        refreshed to support VPN (Virtual Private Network) tunnels and that
        BGP does not provide end-to-end notification making it difficult to
        confirm that all necessary state has been installed or updated.

<p>It is an open question whether VPN signaling protocols should

IPv4 / IPv6 Ships in the Night</h3>

<p>The fact that service providers need to maintain two completely
        separate networks, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6, has been a real
        hindrance to the introduction of IPv6. When IPv6 does get widely
        deployed it will do so without causing the disappearance of IPv4. This
        means that unless something is done, service providers would need to
        maintain the two networks in perpetuity (at least on the foreshortened
        timescale which the Internet world uses).
</p>
<p>It is possible to use a single set of BGP speakers with
        multiprotocol extensions <a class='info' href='#RFC4760'>[RFC4760]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bates, T., Chandra, R., Katz, D., and Y. Rekhter, &ldquo;Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> to exchange
        information about both IPv4 and IPv6 routes between domains, but the
        use of TCP as the transport protocol for the information exchange
        results in an asymmetry when choosing to use one of TCP over IPv4 or
        TCP over IPv6. Successful information exchange confirms one of IPv4 or
        IPv6 reachability between the speakers but not the other, making it
        possible that reachability is being advertised for a protocol for
        which it is not present.
</p>
<p>Also, current implementations do not allow a route to be advertised
        for both IPv4 and IPv6 in the same UPDATE message, because it is not
        possible to explicitly link the reachability information for an
        address family to the corresponding next hop information. This could
        be improved, but currently results in independent UPDATEs being
        exchanged for each address family.

<p>Tools exist (<a class='info' href='#IRRToolSet'>[IRRToolSet]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Internet Systems Consortium, &ldquo;Internet Routing Registry Toolset Project,&rdquo; 2006.</span><span>)</span></a>) that can use the
