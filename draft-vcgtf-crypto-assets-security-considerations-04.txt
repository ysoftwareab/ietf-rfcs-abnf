1.  Introduction

   This document gives guidance as to what security measure should the
   cryptoassets custodians consider and implement to protect the asset
   of its customers.  The management of the signature key for
   cryptoassets especially has different aspects than other types of
   information systems and requires special attention.

   This document reports especially on the appropriate management of the
   signature key by the cryptoassets custodians to avoid the unintended
   transactions for its customers.

   The document organizes recommendations for considering security as a
   purpose of protecting users' assets by operators of cryptoassets
   custodians.  Among the assets to be protected, in particular, the
   signature key of the cryptoassets has a different characteristic from
   the conventional information system and needs attention.  Particular
   emphasis is given to points that should be kept in mind for the
   cryptoassets custodians to properly manage the signature key and to
   prevent illegal transactions that the customer does not intend.

   The basic model of the cryptoassets custodians system covered in this
   document is shown in Section 5.  A system in a form different from
   this basic model, for example, a system where an operator manages a
   signature key provided by a user (e.g. online wallet), is handled in
   another complementary document or later revision of this document.

2.  Scope of this document

   An operator covered by this document is a cryptoassets custodian that
   manages the signature key used in the cryptoassets.  Including the
   case where the management of the signature key is entrusted to
   another custodians operator.  In that case, even for operators
   entrusted with the management of signature key, a considerable part
   of the recommendation indicated in this document is considered to
   apply.

   This document includes considerations on threats and risks for the
   following subjects.

   o  A cryptoassets custodians system that provides cryptoassets
      custodians work to customers (consumers and other exchanges)

   o  Assets information managed by the cryptoassets custodians system
      (including the signature key of the cryptoassets)

   o  The social impact which can be exerted by imperfect security
      measures of the cryptoassets custodians system

   This document does not focus on the following items.

   o  Security measures for information systems used by daily operations
      by custodians operators

   o  Security measures against blockchains that provide the mechanism
      of cryptoassets and distributed ledger itself

   o  Operator's own management risk

   o  Specific requirements on separation of assets of customers and
      custodians/exchanges

5.  Basic description of a model system of a cryptoassets custodian

5.1.  General

   In this section, a model of a cryptoassets custodians system that is
   used to explain the concepts and provisions in this document are
   explained.

5.2.  A basic model of cryptoassets custodians system and its functional
      components

   Followings are the basic model of a crypto assets custodian that this
   document deals with.  A basic model of cryptoassets custodians system
   is shown on Figure 1.


          Figure 1: Basic Model of Cryptoassets Custodians system

   o  Interface (Web Application, APIs) Provides screen and input
      functions such as login process, account management (deposit/
      withdrawal instruction etc.) and trade instruction for the
      customers(users).  Web application, API, etc.

   o  Customer Authentication Function Performs user authentication
      process for login to the cryptoassets custodians.

   o  Customer Credentials Manages required IDs for login and
      verification information related to user authentication process
      (e.g. password verification info.).

   o  Customer Assets Management Function A group of functions to manage
      customer accounts.  Receive instructions for deposit or withdrawal
      (outgoing coins) and perform processing according to the user
      instructions.  Retrieve or update assets data.

   o  Blockchain Node Connects to another blockchain nodes to retrieve
      blockchain data.

   o  Incoming Coin management Function Checks transaction stored in
      blockchain and confirm whether incoming coins are involved in the
      specified addresses.  Update an assets database according to the
      transaction from blockchain.

   o  Order processing function A group of functions that receives
      orders from customers and performs processing related to trading
      of cryptoassets.  Retrieves and updates assets data based on the
      orders.

   o  Assets Database Manages holdings of fiat currencies and
      cryptoassets.  The database does not include the private keys for
      transaction signature.  Assets are managed separately from the
      assets of the custodian for each customer.

   o  Transaction Singing Function

      *  Transaction Generator Generates transactions to be sent to the
         blockchain based on instructions from the customer asset
         management function or the custodians operation function.

      *  Transaction Broadcaster Broadcasts the signed transaction to
         the blockchain.  Connects to other nodes on the blockchain.

      *  Transaction Signing Function Generates digital signatures based
         on the instructed transaction contents and the signature key
         (or its IDs and its addresses).

      *  Address Management Manages public keys with related to the
         signature keys, or addresses (such as values calculated from
         the public keys).

      *  Signature Key Management Function Manages the signature keys of
         the cryptoassets (keys used for signing the transaction).
         Sometimes signature keys are separately stored into the cold-
         wallet as security countermeasure.

      *  Signature key generator Generates signature keys.  The
         generated keys are registered in the signature key management
         function, and the public keys and addresses are registered in
         the address management function.

   o  Custodians Operation Modules A group of functions for custodians'
      operators or administrators.  Based on operations from
      administrators, the module instructs generating new signature keys
      or transferring cryptoassets.

   o  Operator Authentication Function Authenticates the administrators.

   o  Operator Audit Database Manages auditing data related to the
      authentication of the administrators.

   We defined each functional element to distinguish functions
   logically, and do not show the actual arrangement on the actual
   system.  For example, in our actual system, the address management
   unit may be managed by an integrated database.  Also, there are
   implementations with multiple functions packaged together.  For
   example, each functional element of the transaction signature system

   may be integrated with the customer property management system, or
   the transaction signature system may be operating as another system.

   When using existing implementations such as bitcoin wallet, bitcoin
   wallet is thought to provide the functions of the transaction
   signature system as just one implementation as a whole.  It is also
   conceivable that some functions are provided by a remote
   subcontractor as in a form in which the function of the transaction
   signature system is provided by a remote server.

5.3.  The flow leading to the sending of the transaction

   o  Deposit Phase

      1.  Customers send fiat to custodian's bank account.

      2.  Custodians shall confirm to receive fiat, and shall update
          assets database to reflect customer asset information.

   o  Input coin phase

      1.  Customer transfer cryptoassets to the address instructed by
          custodians.  The transfer shall be made by cryptoassets wallet
          for the customer such as tools or services (other custodians
          or Web wallet)

      2.  Custodians shall confirm cryptoassets has been transferred to
          the address instructed and shall update the asset database to
          reflect asset information of the customer.

   o  Trading phase

      1.  Customer access to interfaces to make instructions.

      2.  Instructions to transfer shall be processed by custodians
          operations functions.  The result of trade processed by
          custodians operations functions shall be updated into the
          asset database.

   o  Instructions to output coins from customers

      1.  Customers access to interface and instruct it to transfer its
          cryptoassets to other address.  (Instruct to output coins)

      2.  Instructions to output coins shall be processed by customer
          assets management functions.  Transaction generator shall make
          transaction messages based on instructions such as receive
          address or amount of cryptoassets.

      3.  Transaction messages shall be added a digital signature by
          transaction signing functions.

      4.  Transaction messages with a digital signature shall be
          delivered to all nodes on blockchain by transaction
          broadcaster.

   o  Instruction to transfer from Customer Assets Management Function

      1.  Administrator instructs to send cryptoassets to address
          through the interface of Management Functions.  For Example,
          it may send between address managed inside custodians.

      2.  Instructions to transfer shall be processed on Management
          Function, and shall be processed as described 2 to 4 on
          "output coin".  Transactions with digital signature shall be
          delivered to all nodes on blockchain.

   After a pair of keys (signature & verification, hereafter "key pair")
   is generated, an addressed to receive transaction is derived from the
   verification key.  By providing a sender of digital assets this
   address, the sender is able to transfer one or more assets to this
   address.  When the recipient transfers the assets to another address,
   the original recipient signs the transaction data which includes the
   transfer order.

   A signature key is considered to be in an inactive state when it is
   stored in a confidential manner (ie. cannot be directly used to
   sign), for example within the key management function in Figure 1.
   An example of how to set a signature key in an inactive state is to
   encrypt the signature key using an encryption key (ie. passphrase).

   The opposite process of decrypting the signature key will return the
   key inactive state.  The activation of a key is assumed to be
   executed within the transaction signing function in Figure 1.

   Activation and deactivation of keys is part of the function set of
   certain wallets.

   The signature key is not needed after its generation until a
   transaction has to be signed.  Therefore this allows for the store
   and manages signature keys offline while keeping the verification key
   and addresses online (See: Section 7.3.6.2).


        Figure 3: Lifecycle of signature key, verification key and
   encryption/decryption key for signature key in case of deterministic
                                  wallet

   The deterministic wallet is a mechanism that generates one master
   seed and generates multiple signature key pairs from that master
   seed.  It is possible to regenerate each signature key pair from the
   master seed by backing up the master seed and restoring it.  On the
   other hand, if the master seed is stolen, the crypto assets which are
   managed by all signature key pairs (and addresses) derived from the
   master seed may be stolen.  Also, if the master seed is lost, all
   signature key pairs will not be able to be regenerated.

   As an extension of the deterministic wallet, there is a hierarchical
   deterministic wallet (HD wallet).  In the case of HD wallet, a master
   key pair is created from the master seed, and child key pairs are
   derived from the master key pair.  Furthermore, descendant key pairs
   can be derived from the child key pairs in a hierarchical manner.
   Since the child key pair can be created from the parent key pair, it
   is not necessary to access the master seed when generating the child
   key pair.  The implementation of hierarchical key pair generation

   depends on the signature algorithm, and some currencies cannot be
   realized in principle.  Although this document refers mainly to the
   management of the signature keys in the security control measures,
   the master seed also needs security management equal to or higher
   than the signature keys.

5.4.3.  On the use of multiple keys

   There are some cases to use cryptoassets where one user uses one
   address, one user uses multiple addresses.  The number of addresses
   and pairs depends on the number of cryptassets and method of
   management.  For example, cryptoassets that can contain tags related
   to the transaction such as Ripple and NEM, cryptoassets custodian may
   distinguish customers by each tag if custodian uses one address.  On
   the other hand, cryptoassets that cannot contain any tags for
   transactions, custodians have to make addresses for each customer, so
   the number of addresses and key pairs would be increased.  It is
   considered to use multiple addresses and key pairs by risk evaluation
   with not only a variety of cryptoassets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum,
   etc.) but also management by the hot wallet and cold wallet.

   It is recommended not to reuse key pair for general.  But it is
   focussed for anonymous transactions by private use, so this is not
   suitable for custodians from viewpoint of efficiency and
   practicality.  Cryptoassets custodians shall make effective controls
   considered by risk evaluations and control objective.

5.4.4.  On the suspension of keys

   Even if Figure 2 indicates operations on operations of custodian,
   cancellation of transaction cannot be made for cryptoassets.  Also,
   it is difficult to revoke the signature key after suspension of using
   keys.  For example, it may happen to input coins to the address user
   has suspended to use.  To return coins to the sender, custodian needs
   a signature key for the suspended address. cryptoassets custodians
   shall assume those cases, and shall consider about revoking signature
   keys carefully.

5.5.  Characteristics of cryptoassets in blockchain and distributed
      ledger

5.5.1.  About this section

   In the handling of cryptoassets using blockchain / distributed
   ledger, there are things to emphasize and different characteristics
   compared with general information systems and usages of private/
   encryption keys.  In considering the risk assessment described in




Sato, et al.            Expires October 12, 2019               [Page 10]

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


   Section 6 and the security requirements and measures based thereon,
   it is necessary to pay attention to these characteristics.

5.5.2.  Importance of signature keys

   As described in Section 5.3, by signing transactions using the
   signature keys, it is possible to instruct the transfer of the values
   of cryptoassets to other addresses.  Once this transaction is written
   to the block or ledger data and the transfer of the values of
   cryptoassets is approved it is difficult to revert it or to
   invalidate the transfer by revocation procedure etc.  This property
   is in contrast to taking time until the remittance gets caught or the
   process can be canceled during remittance and be reassembled, even if
   it requires complicated administrative procedures in the process of
   remittance, and illegal remittances occur.  In addition, when the
   private signature keys have vanished in the cryptoasset scheme, there
   will be a case that the cryptoasset held by the address corresponding
   to the signature private key is impossible to transfer to the other.
   In cryptoassets having such irreversible nature, it must pay
   attention to the theft, fraudulent use and disappearance of the
   signature secret key.

5.5.3.  Diversity of implementations

   There are various cryptoassets including Bitcoin.  The specifications
   also vary widely from cryptoassets to cryptoassets.  For example,
   there are differences in the using of encryption algorithms, hash
   functions, the methods of generating/spreading transactions, and
   wallet implementations to protect the signature key(s), and so on.
   Due to these differences in specifications, effective countermeasures
   for a specific cryptoasset may not be able to be carried out under
   the specification of another cryptoassets.  And also, from the
   current feaver trends of the cryptoassets, the appearance of new
   cryptoassets and the speed of functional expansion and specification
   change of existing cryptoassets mechanisms are very fast.

5.5.3.1.  Cryptographic algorithm of cryptoassets

   There are cases that new cryptographic algorithms in cryptoassets
   that are not sufficiently reviewed for security may be adopted.  In
   ordinary use cases of cryptography technology, designers often use
   cryptographic algorithms that are scientifically verified,
   mathematically proved secure, and approved by official authorities/
   agencies, however, cryptoassets designers are often adopting
   "immature and unverified" cryptographic algorithms.  This means that
   it takes time to archive provable security for algorithms and approve
   by official authorities/agencies, while in the blockchain where
   competition and evolution are remarkable, the maturity level is low



Sato, et al.            Expires October 12, 2019               [Page 11]

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


   as technology, and differentiation and blocking from other
   cryptoassets.  It must be optimized the technology specific to the
   chain.  These algorithms are likely to have no properly reviewed
   implementation, or the risk of a vulnerability being discovered later
   and compromising (compared to mature algorithms) is high.

5.5.4.  Possibility of blockchain forks

   In the blockchain using Proof-of-Work and the like typified by
   bitcoins, a state such as a temporary fork of a chain due to
   specification change of software or a single chain of branched chains
   (re-organization) can arise.  Also, as another case, due to the
   division of the developer community, blockchains are divided from the
   point of time and sometimes operated as separate cryptoassets.  In
   the real world, there are various forks, it may be difficult to
   respond to all of them, and it should be consider countermeasures
   according to the risks.

5.5.4.1.  Rolling back due to re-organization

   If the chain is discarded due to a reorganization, the history of
   transactions contained in the discarded chain will be lost.  In that
   case, the transaction on the block discarded within the
   reorganization period may not be reflected in the main-chain.

5.5.4.2.  Handling forks of cryptoassets

   As in the case of bitcoins and ether symbols, blockchains are divided
   and sometimes managed as another cryptoassets (here, called a fork
   coin).  The fork coin is also derived from the same software as the
   original cryptoassets and uses the same technology and compatible
   technology (A description that incorporates the case where different
   technologies are adopted for a fork is necessary).  In addition, the
   chain until just before splitting has exact identical data.  By using
   its functionality, it becomes possible to attack, for example, replay
   attacks.  A replay attack is an attack in which transactions used in
   the original cryptoassets are retransmitted to the sender of the
   transaction at the fork coin chain and the fork coin is illegally
   acquired as a result.  In this kind of replay attacks,
   countermeasures such as monitoring of the transaction sender, for
   fork coin chain, measures to be sent before transactions that return
   coins to their own other address are required.

   In addition, if a fork coin occurs in the cryptoassets held by the
   exchanger, there is also a problem that the fork coin is not returned
   to the user unless the fork coin is assigned to the user of the
   exchanger in the exchange system.

5.5.5.  Risks for Unauthorized Transactions

5.5.5.1.  About this section

   Just by sending the transaction instructing the transfer of the
   coins(assets) to the node of the blockchain does not instantly
   reflect the cryptoassets transfer.  In order for a transaction to be
   approved, it is stored in a block created every decided period and
   needs to be accepted by the majority of mining nodes.  It may be
   difficult to confirm that the transaction has been approved for the
   following reasons.

5.5.5.2.  Handling unapproved transactions

   In a cryptasset using a distributed ledger, there are a variety of
   cryptoassets (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) that the transaction
   sender sends transactions with a transaction fee.  This transaction
   fee is acquired by the miner who creates the block, and the higher
   the transaction cost, It is easy to store in blocks (transactions are
   easily approved immediately).  If the cost of the transaction sent
   from the cryptoassets custodian to the blockchain is low, it may take
   times to approve the transaction, or there is a possibility that the
   time will expire without being approved.  Besides the case due to the
   transaction fee, the temporary chain fork as in Section 5.5.4.1 can
   be occurred that the transaction that should have been approved once
   becomes the unapproved state and the dual spend of cryptoassets.  In
   usage scenes where cryptoassets transfer is required immediately,
   such as payments in real stores, it may be difficult to take time to
   confirm the approval of the transaction, and it is necessary to
   assume the risk of unauthorized transactions.

5.5.5.3.  Transaction failure due to vulnerabilities from cryptoassets
          specifications and implementations

   Although it is not exactly the case of unauthorized transactions,
   there was a vulnerability called transaction malleability as a past
   case of bitcoins.  With this vulnerability, if the node relaying the
   transaction is malicious, it is also possible to make transactions
   illegally manipulate, thereby making it impossible to find the
   transaction stored in the block (make it impossible to search by
   transaction ID).  There is also the possibility of an attack that
   makes a duplicate by requesting transmission of the cryptoassets
   again from the counterparty by making the approved transaction appear
   as not approved.  This attack is performed after sending the
   transaction to the nodes, so it is characteristic that the sender can
   not take measures beforehand before sending.  Regarding transaction
   malleability, it is now possible to avoid it by using SegWit in
   bitcoins.  However, as a lesson from this case, effective defense

   measures cannot be made effective only with the cryptoassets
   custodian that becomes the sender or receiver of the cryptoassets
   with respect to faults and threats due to another vulnerability of
   bitcoins and other cryptoassets.

6.  Risks of cryptoassets custodian

6.1.  About this chapter

   Below in this section, some risks custodian shall consider for the
   system and for foreign factor outside of control from custodian such
   as blockchain is described.  The risks for systems in custodians are
   listed as a threat, factor, and actor may cause threat.  The risks
   for foreign factor outside of control from custodian such as
   blockchain are listed from the incident.  Some risks may be caused by
   property or quality described in Section 5.5.

   On the other hand, there are some risks based on operations or
   systems implemented by each custodians.  Custodians shall pick up
   risks to deal with control to refer these risks with understanding
   with system or operation of custodian.  Custodians shall evaluate
   impacts may be affected by risks and shall decide controls and its
   priority.

6.2.  Risks of cryptoassets custodian system

   In this section, major risks regarding information asset which
   cryptoassets custodian system holds are listed.  Among the
   fundamental model shown in Section 5, the signature key and asset
   data are focused as significant information asset to protect
   customers asset.

   The attacker may be able to broadcast a malicious transaction to
   nodes of distributed-ledger after generating the transaction if the
   signature key and surrounding environment are not safe.

   Withdrawing transaction is almost impossible once the malicious
   transaction has been broadcasted and built into the blockchain.
   Therefore, prior countermeasures to prevent generating malicious
   transaction are essential.

   Moreover, consideration of a loss of signature key is also essential.
   Cryptoassets stored in the address associated with the signature key
   become unavailable in a case where the signature key has been lost.

   Risk regarding the signature key including the signature key and
   surrounding environment are mentioned in Section 6.2.1 based on
   Figure 1.

   In this document, the model is described as more abstract as the
   content of data, data format, management model or details of
   processing regarding asset data varies among custodians.  Record such
   as client assets (both cryptoassets and fiat currency), assets of
   custodians(both cryptoassets and fiat currency), clients' account
   information, or address of cryptoassets is listed as common content
   of asset data subject to protection.  Manipulation to those asset
   data caused by the attacker results in damage to client assets or
   affect to the custodians' operation.  Risks related to assets data
   are discussed in Section 6.2.2.

   Risks of system outage MUST be considered concerning availability
   which allows clients to control their assets in addition to the
   protection of important information such as the signature key or
   assets data.  Risks of system control are discussed in
   Section 6.2.3.2.

   In addition to information or risks mentioned in this section, system
   specific risks varied among cryptoassets custodian or risks regarding
   external contractor MUST be considered.  Detailed risk analysis MUST
   be performed against the actual system of the cryptoassets custodian.

6.2.1.  Risks related to signature keys

   Both role and risks of signature keys are extremely large on
   cryptoasset exchange.  Signature keys enable to transfer coins, but
   it comes from properties of difficulties for revocation of lost,
   leakage, stolen, and rollback transaction.  Some risks about
   signature keys are listed in this section.  In addition, risks about
   supply chain related to risks install wallets handles signature keys.

6.2.1.1.  Risk analysis related to signature key

   Risk analysis may depend on threats assumption, the structure of the
   system, and threats model, the results for each custodians shall be
   different.  Some case studies are described in this section.

   Threats for signature keys and its actors are assumed as listed
   below.  And actors are assumed as the input of signature key in
   Figure 1.

   o  Threats:

      *  Loss

      *  Leakage, Theft

      *  Unauthorized Use

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


   o  Factors of Threats:

      *  Error in operation

      *  Maliciousness (of legitimate person)

      *  Spoofing (for legitimate person))

      *  Malicious intentions of outsiders

      *  Unintended behavior (system)

   o  Actors:

      *  Custodians operation modules

      *  Transaction Signing modules

      *  Customer assets management function

      *  Incoming Coin management function

   Factors of threats are organized as follow.

   Error in operation: A human error caused by an authorized user
   (including an administrator) during operation of the system.  For
   example, the expected operation was to withdraw coin equivalent to
   100,000 JPY.  But, the actual operation is withdrawing coin
   equivalent to 1,000,000 JPY.

   Malicious acts by authorized person: An act committed with malice by
   an authorized person (including an administrator).  For example,
   theft or unauthorized use of the signature key by the insider.
   Purpose or incentive of the act is not concerned.

   Spoofing(of authorized person): Impersonation with a stolen
   credential of an authorized person.  For example, the order to
   sell/buy/transfer cryptoassets by an external attacker impersonating
   a client; the malicious order of transfer or generation/signing of a
   transaction through access to the system with the legitimate
   operator/administrator credential by an unauthorized insider.
   Especially, theft and abuse of credential upon an account
   registration by impersonating a legitimate user MUST be considered.
   Note: Impersonation which is not caused by theft of legitimate user/
   authorized person's credential (e.g., Privilege escalation) are
   mentioned in "malicious acts by outsiders."

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


   Malicious acts by outsiders: Access or operation to the system by
   outsiders with malicious purpose excluding spoofing. (e.g., external
   unauthorized access by exploiting a vulnerability; remote access to
   the system which enables outsiders to operate to the signature key or
   generate a transaction by a targetted attack to an administrator of
   the custodians' system.)

   Unintended behavior: An unintended behavior of the system regardless
   of intention or malice. (e.g., leakage of the signature key caused by
   bugs of the system, generation of a transaction including an
   incorrect amount of assets regardless of operation.)

   Theft and unauthorized use are threats that can only be caused by a
   clear malicious factor.  Risks to be considered as a result of
   threats are listed in Table 2.  Please note that theft and
   unauthorized use could happen in a case where multiple factors such
   as an error in operation or unintended behavior have occurred. (e.g.,
   insertion of backdoor that transmits a signature key or tampers a
   signing order to the transaction in conjunction with a specific
   legitimate operation.)  This case can be covered in countermeasures
   of theft or unauthorized use.

      Table 2: List of possible risks for the signature key, Y means
         applicable risk exists, - means no applicable risk exists

   The following sections outline each risk.  The control measures
   corresponding to each risk are shown in Section 7.3.

6.2.1.2.  Risk of loss of signature key

   Risks listed below are an event which causes loss of the signature
   key from a viewpoint of input to the signature key such as order or
   operation.

   As a typical event, the loss of the signature key caused by human
   error in operation by the administrator of the custodians' system may
   be considered.

6.2.1.3.  Leakage and theft risk of signature key

   In most case, theft is caused by the operation of a malicious person.
   By contrast, leakage could happen by error or fault not requiring the
   malice.  Therefore, the risk of theft and the risk of leakage MUST be
   separately considered.

   The risks of leakage shown in Table 2 are lists of the event which
   potentially causes leakage of the signature key including the leakage
   caused by error/fault regarding the input to the signature key such
   as an order or an operation.  For example, an internal criminal,
   unintentional behavior of the system and intrusion to the system.

   Likewise, the risks of theft are lists of the event which potentially
   causes the theft of the signature key by a malicious person.  For
   example, an internal criminal and intrusion to the system.

   Regarding the leakage of sensitive information to the outside, both
   leakage and theft are similar, and the countermeasures are the same.
   The countermeasures are discussed in Section 7.3.6.

6.2.1.4.  Risks of unauthorized use of the signature key

   The risks of unauthorized use shown in Table 2 are lists of the event
   which causes unauthorized use by a malicious person.  For example,
   spoofing of the authorized person and intrusion to the system.

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


   Unauthorized use of the signature key could be caused by unauthorized
   operation of pre-processes of an unsigned transaction at transaction
   signing function in addition to the direct unauthorized use of the
   signature key.  Following example shows unauthorized use at an early
   stage of the process.

   o  A destination address of cryptoassets or amount of assets is
      manipulated due to tampering of software at transaction signing
      function.  The tamper disables designed validation process at the
      transaction signing function.

   o  A destination address of cryptoassets or amount of assets is
      manipulated due to tampering of the unsigned transaction generated
      by transaction generator.  Besides, an unauthorized transaction
      has generated and given to the transaction signing function.

   o  A destination address of cryptoassets or amount of assets is
      manipulated due to tampering of software at transaction generator.
      An unsigned transaction has generated with an unauthorized direct
      operation to transaction generator.

   o  An incorrect amount or incorrect destination address of
      cryptoassets has transmitted from custodian operation function
      through transaction generator due to an internal crime, error in
      operation, or spoofing of the identity by the administrator.

   o  Assets database has tampered in a case where the operation/order
      to transaction generator refers to the assets database.  (See:
      Section 6.2.2)

   As shown in the above example, the attacker is able to obtain
   cryptoassets without attacking to the signature key illicitly.  In
   particular, countermeasures MUST be considered in a case where the
   system automates each process.

   Security control measures to the signature key MUST be performed.
   Moreover, security control measures to the entire custodian's system
   MUST be performed against these complex risks.  Security control
   measures are discussed in Section 7.

6.2.1.5.  Other risks

6.2.1.5.1.  Supply chain risk of hardware wallet

   Hardware-wallet is known to have a function to manage signature keys.
   In most hardware-wallet, key administration is done on an
   administrative terminal connecting via USB such as PC.




Sato, et al.            Expires October 12, 2019               [Page 20]

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


   Cryptographic module validation program for products having a
   cryptographic key management function such as FIPS 140-2 are
   provided.  However, most of the cryptographic algorithms used in
   cryptoassets are not covered by those validation programs.
   Therefore, third-party safety validation program subject to hardware-
   wallet for cryptoassets is not well provided.  For this reason, the
   users of hardware-wallet MUST understand that safety level of the
   hardware-wallet available at a market differs among the product.

   Furthermore, the safety could be threatened by tampering the product
   during distribution channel even though the product has a certain
   level of safety in the factory.  For example, hardware-wallet
   tampered in a distribution channel to have a malware enables the
   attacker to restore the signature key generated by a legitimate owner
   without acquiring the hardware-wallet.

6.2.2.  Risks related to assets data

   Assets data is data to manage an amount of cryptoassets/fiat
   currencies held by clients or custodian itself.  The signature key
   for transaction signing is not recorded in the assets data.  (See:
   Section 5.2)

   As mentioned earlier, assets data differs among the custodians, an
   abstracted model is used in this section.  In this section, a brief
   thought is given since detailed threat assessment and risk analysis
   MUST be performed against assets data of the actual custodians'
   system.

   Major threats to the assets data are unauthorized manipulation, loss,
   and leakage.  The factors are an error in operation by the
   administrator, malicious acts by the authorized person, spoofing of
   the authorized person, malicious acts by outsiders, and unintended
   behavior of the system.

   In a case of the basic model shown in Section 5.2, attack surfaces
   are custodian operation function, assets database, and incoming coin
   management function.

   Following example shows the incidents caused by unauthorized
   manipulation among the risks to assets data.

   o  An incident that the malicious transaction generated by assets
      database which refers manipulated assets data has broadcasted
      through a legitimate process.  (See: Section 6.2.1.4)

   o  Unauthorized manipulation to a number of assets stored in asset
      data between clients and/or between clients and custodians by

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


      tampering a list of cryptoassets address linked to clients.  This
      enables losing assets of clients or custodians without
      broadcasting the transaction to the blockchain.

   Risks of assets data may be considered as risks of system in
   financial service and settlement service.  However, countermeasures
   to the incident that transaction(s) has merged into blockchain as a
   result of unauthorized manipulation to the assets data MUST be
   considered with an understanding that transaction broadcast to the
   network is irreversible.

6.2.3.  Risks of suspension on system and operation

   Cryptoassets custodians' systems are composed of software, hardware,
   networks.  Operations are classified as monitoring, opening an
   account, an order of transfer, deposit/withdrawal of (crypto/fiat)
   assets from the wallet, and any operations by the operator.  The
   system may be suspended due to various factors.

   Cryptoassets custodians' system tends to be a subject to the attack
   due to following: the systems are connected to the Internet for 24
   hours 365 days, not by the leased line, many of the systems are
   deployed on cloud services, prices of cryptoassets are effected from
   operating condition of the cryptoassets custodians.  Therefore,
   countermeasures to the attack MUST be considered.

6.2.3.1.  Risks related to network congestion

   Cryptoassets custodians may be attacked by DoS and traffic flooding.
   In general, targets of attack are a top page of the Website, API
   endpoint, etc., but operation and monitoring system deployed on the
   Internet may be a target of DoS attack in a case where the attacker
   acquired the information of the system beforehand.

6.2.3.2.  Risks of system suspension due to infrastructure

   System and operation may be suspended in a case data center or cloud
   infrastructure where custodian's system is deployed are suspended.
   The system may be suspended due to various factors such as blackout
   and disruption of communication due to acts of nature, due to
   operation failure by cloud or infrastructure, and failure of software
   release.

6.2.3.3.  Risks of system suspension due to the operator

   Even if the system is in operation, there is a possibility that the
   service may be suspended if operation monitoring and the activities
   of the operator in charge of work are hindered.  For example, there

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


   is a possibility that business would be suspended due to various
   factors such as periodic inspection of power supply facilities at
   operational sites, disruption of transportation by disaster, strikes,
   and obstruction of building access by protest activities and rush of
   reporters.  There are also risks that many personnel cannot operate
   due to the same reasons, such as using the same transportation
   method, participating in the same event, or traffic accident or food
   poisoning.

6.2.3.4.  Regulatory risks

   In countries where the cryptoassets custodian is defined by law and
   should be licensed or registered, operations may be suspended by
   order of business improvement, operation suspends, deletion of
   license or registration issued by the authority.

6.3.  Risks from external factors

   Even if a cryptoassets custodian performs its operation
   appropriately, the cryptoassets custodian could not continue the
   service or might not execute transactions when encountering attack to
   the blockchain network and/or the network infrastructure connecting
   each node.

6.3.1.  Risks related to the Internet, Web PKI, and users environment

6.3.1.1.  Attack to Internet routing and DNS

   Attackers can lower the reachability to cryptoassets custodians, lure
   a user into the fake cryptoassets custodian, or fork deliberately by
   preventing the synchronization of the blockchain, through the
   intervention in routing or DNS, such as BGP hijacking.  These methods
   might be used by not only malicious attackers, ISPs acting
   governments order.

6.3.1.2.  Attack to Web PKI

   Most cryptoassets custodians provide their services on the Web and
   use TLS and server certificates for authenticity and confidentiality
   of their website.  When the certification authority issuing their
   certificates encounter an attack, it yields to enable to spoofing the
   cryptoassets custodians' website.  When the certificate is revoked,
   the cryptoassets custodian might not be able to provide own service.

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


6.3.1.3.  Attack to messaging systems

   Attackers can swindle or block the e-mail and SMS using for
   delivering One-Time Password, through the intervention in messaging
   systems such as SMS or e-mail.  When a users message is swindled,
   attackers can log in as the spoofed user or reset the password.

6.3.1.4.  Risks related to users environment infection

   When a user's environment such as PC and smartphone is infected by
   malware, any secrets such as credentials in the environment might be
   swindled.

6.3.2.  Risks related to cryptocurrency blockchain

6.3.2.1.  Split or fork of blockchain

   A distributed ledger might be forked by specification changes without
   consensus in the developers community.  There are two cases around
   the fork; one is that the transaction before the fork is executed and
   recorded in both ledgers after the fork, another one is that the
   transaction before the fork is executed and recorded in only one
   ledger.

6.3.2.2.  Blockchain Re-organization caused by 51% attack or selfish
          mining

   When a block which is committed in the past is discarded, the
   transaction included in the discarded block might be rolled back.
   The transaction included in the discarded block is disabled, and
   cryptoassets or fiat money paid in compensation for the transaction
   might be swindled.

6.3.2.3.  Compromising cryptographic algorithm and hash function

   Improvement of performance of computing power and the discovery of
   effective attack might cause being compromisation of the
   cryptographic algorithm and hash function.

6.3.2.4.  Inadequate blockchain specification and implementation

   In the cryptoassets Lisk, there were implementations in which the
   timestamp value of the transaction allowed implementation of
   numerical value input in a range not permitted by the internal
   database so that each node could not process the transaction and
   block generation stopped[LISK-ISSUE:2088].  This issue was fixed
   within several hours after the problem occurred and the node updated
   the client software, and the network was sequentially recovered.



Sato, et al.            Expires October 12, 2019               [Page 24]

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


   However, the transactions could not be processed in the blockchain
   for a certain period.

   There are cases that token value collapses due to inadequate
   implementations of smart contract.  In Beautychain Token (BEC) of
   ERC20 token issued on Ethereum, there is a vulnerability that causes
   overflow in the smart contract, so there is an attack which derives
   greatly exceeded tokens over the upper limit, then the worth of BEC
   was collapsed.  [CVE-2018-10299]

6.3.2.5.  Rapid changes in the hashrate

   When the hash rate increases or decreases rapidly, it might take a
   very long time for generating blocks using the remaining node.

6.3.3.  Risks from external reputation

6.3.3.1.  Bank account frozen

   Banks might freeze an account of cryptoassets custodians operation,
   by the guidance of regulatory as a countermeasure for AML/CFT, or by
   some accidents/incidents.  This freeze results in a suspending a
   deposit/withdraw operation of clients fiat assets.

6.3.3.2.  Address of cryptocurency

   As countermeasures for AML/CFT, other cryptoassets custodian Y might
   assess whether the destination address of cryptoassets custodian X
   have a high deal risk when a user of Y transfers some assets to the
   address of X.  If an address of X is blacklisted, the transaction
   between X and Y might not be executed smoothly.

   Since criminals often transfer the stolen "cryptoassets" to
   unmalicious third party's address for disrupting investigation, the
   address might be involuntarily categorized as high-risk.

6.3.3.3.  Filtering or blocking website

   Users might not be able to access cryptoassets custodian when its URL
   is filtered out by network operators or is blocked by ISPs.  When a
   cryptoassets custodian's website is recognized as used for malware
   distribution, its URL might not be appeared in search results or not
   be able to browse in the browser.

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


6.3.3.4.  Email

   Most mail servers provide a filtering service or a classifying
   service based on reputation, as countermeasures for spam mail.  If
   the e-mail from the cryptoassets custodian is recognized as spam
   mail, the custodian might not be able to contact the user.

6.3.3.5.  Appraisal of a smartphone application

   Application delivery platform might limit applications from handling
   cryptoassets.  When the application provided by a cryptoassets
   custodian could not be approved by the platforms, a user cannot
   download the application for access to the custodian, and cannot use
   the services.

6.3.3.6.  ID theft

   There is some case where the attacker acts malicious instruction
   spoofing as a user, for example: - list based attack, - theft of ID,
   password or other credentials, by a malware infection, and - theft of
   API access token.

   The distinctive purposes of spoofing are: - theft of fiat currency or
   cryptoassets by unauthorized withdrawals, - money laundering by
   cashing cryptoassets with an account in the name of other people, and
   - profit shifting by market manipulation by unauthorized buy and sell
   cryptoassets.

7.  Considerations of security controls on Cryptoassets Custodians

7.1.  General

   Below is a basis of security controls about risks written in
   Section 6.

   To promote understanding and coverage, all security controls in this
   chapter are followed by below: [ISO.27001:2013] , [ISO.27002:2013].
   There are some specific considerations for Cryptoassets Custodians to
   follow ISOs.  Especially, the organization shall consider for strong
   controls to manage signature keys for cryptoassets backed by assets.

   Other security controls are expected to be referred to similar
   operations by the financial sector.  Security controls should be
   included concrete content from results of risk analysis and
   vulnerability diagnosis.  Threats of cybersecurity are changing,
   reviews of security controls according to situations are important.
   Articles below are expected to describe contents by references and
   completion of description.

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


7.2.  Basis for consideration about security management

   There are some standards of requirement for information security,
   [ISO.27001:2013] and [ISO.27002:2013].  Cryptoassets Custodians shall
   refer the requirement or guidance of these standards and consider
   security controls needed and shall establish, implement, maintain and
   continually improve security management.  Cryptoassets Custodians has
   data of customers asset, self asset, customer information, signature
   keys.  Those shall be protected from leakage, loss, tampering, and
   misuse.  Cryptoassets Custodians shall consider about risks of lost
   assets by foreign factors such as blockchains or network, suspension
   of system, and shall act properly.  Cryptoassets Custodians shall
   mainly consider about security management described below:

   o  Interested parties (from "4.  Context of organization",
      [ISO.27001:2013]) To protect assets of cryptoassets custodian's
      customer.  Division of responsibility between outsourced and
      cryptoassets custodians such as management of signature keys for
      cryptoassets.  Impact of business such as money laundering shall
      be considered from another viewpoint.

   o  Policy (from "5.  Leadership", [ISO.27001:2013]) Cryptoassets
      custodians shall establish an information security policy that
      includes information security objectives and controls.
      Information security policy shall be disclosed so that customers
      can browse.

   o  Continual improvement and risk assessment (from "6.  Planning",
      "8.  Operation", "9.  Performance evaluation", and
      "10.Improvement", [ISO.27001:2013]) As described in Section 6.3.2,
      numbers of cryptoassets have been developed and its speed of
      evolving is rapid, Cryptoassets Custodians shall monitor security
      risks about cryptoassets in addition to information security
      management applied in general.  Cryptoassets Custodians shall
      review and improve security controls according to the situation.

7.3.  Considerations about security controls on Cryptoassets custodians

   Cryptoassets Custodians shall determine information security
   objectives and controls from the viewpoint listed below:

   o  Risk treatment options to prevent from loss, steal, leakage,
      misuse of secret keys used for cryptoassets, customer data, and
      customer asset.

   o  Compliance with business

   o  Compliance with legal and contractual requirements

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


   There are some considerations described in Section 7.2 about security
   controls based on system risks at Cryptoassets Custodians.  There is
   a guidance for security controls as [ISO.27002:2013], Cryptoassets
   Custodians shall refer it to design and / or identify security
   controls.  Section 7.3.1 to Section 7.3.13 below are followed to
   [ISO.27002:2013] and describe items to be especially noted in the
   virtual currency exchange system.

7.3.1.  Information security policies

   Information security policies shall be defined to follow Section 5 on
   [ISO.27002:2013].  Information security objectives on Cryptoassets
   Custodians shall include conservation of customer's asset,
   requirements of the business, compliance with legal and contractual
   requirements, social responsibilities.  Information security policies
   shall contain policies about access controls ( on Section 7.3.5 ),
   cryptographic controls ( on Section 7.3.6 ), operations security ( on
   Section 7.3.8 ), and communications security ( on Section 7.3.9 ) .

7.3.2.  Organization of information security

   Cryptoassets custodians shall follow "6.  Organization of information
   security" on [ISO.27002:2013], and shall establish a management
   framework to implement and operate information security.
   Cryptoassets custodians shall consider about threats such as an
   illegal acquisition of signature keys or illegal creation of
   transaction carefully.  Segregation of duties shall be fully examined
   to manage signature keys for signing or to permit create
   transactions.

7.3.3.  Human resource security

   Cryptoassets custodians shall follow section "7.  Human resource
   security" on [ISO.27002:2013].  To examine and evaluate security
   controls, cryptoassets custodians shall deploy human resources with
   expertise not only in information security applied in general but
   also in cryptoassets and blockchain technology.  All employees may
   handle assets and shall receive appropriate education and training
   and regular updates in organizational policies and procedures.

7.3.4.  Asset management

   Cryptoassets custodians shall follow section "8.  Asset management"
   on [ISO.27002:2013].  Cryptoassets custodians shall contain any
   pieces of information to manage assets, and information and asset of
   the customer such as the signature key.  Cryptoassets custodians
   shall determine controls suitable for risks to follow this section if
   cryptoassets custodians operate hardware wallets.  To protect assets

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


   of customers, cryptoassets custodians shall separate assets into
   customers and custodians to follow compliances with accounting.

7.3.5.  Access control

   Cryptoassets Custodians shall follow section "9.  Access Controls" on
   [ISO.27002:2013].

   Users are separated into 2 parties; Permitted operators and
   administrators within outsourced, and customers.  Some considerations
   for operators and administrators are written in Section 7.3.5.1, and
   for customer is written in Section 7.3.5.2

7.3.5.1.  Access controls for operators and administrators

   There are some cases for operators and administrators.

   o  Operators and administrators for custodians system.  They will
      command to create keys or to transfer funds by software or
      terminal.

   o  Administrators to maintain hardware, OS, databases, and
      middleware.

   Management measures of signature keys such as activate, backup,
   restore are described on Section 7.3.6.  Cryptoassets custodian shall
   be carried out to assign authority to operate properly and shall set
   access control.  Access controls shall be include authorize and
   permit to connect custodians system from remote, authorize for
   external service if using as functions for cryptoasset custodians,
   authorize as a user for OS and databases, permit to enter and leave
   facilities systems or terminals installed.  There are some factors to
   permit access: Only office hours or predetermined hours, Only IP
   addresses assigned for specific terminals, Confirm by credentials to
   connect from operators or terminals predetermined.  Cryptoassets
   custodians shall consider for access control policies by roles or
   authorities of operators and administrators for each system.  Access
   control shall be set the minimum to run functions or software
   permitted for operators or administrators, not only for applications.

   Any damage may be happened by miss or injustice operations on
   transferring assets or managing signature keys as described
   Section 6.2.  To deter these threats, Confirmation of or approval by
   multiple operators or multiple administrators shall be needed on
   important operations such as transferring assets and operations for
   the signature key.  Cryptoassets custodians shall not concentrate
   duties for one operator or administrator, decentralize of duties for
   multiple operators or administrators shall be needed.

7.3.5.2.  Access control for customers (user authentication / API)

   o  Strict personal identification on setup account The account shall
      be set up by strict personal identification, and account
      information shall be sent to the person itself.  For example,
      personal identification shall be operated by an identification
      document issued by the public organization and shall be sent a
      letter to the address without forwarding.  Personal identification
      shall be carried out in accordance with relevant laws,
      regulations, treaty such as FATF.  Replacement of pictures on an
      identification document or falsification of attribute information
      is typical treats for personal identification.  In order to
      operate personal identification strictly, it shall be carried out
      to verify by software or visual check and verify by an electric
      method such as signature that is hard to falsification.

   o  Managing credential and multi-factor authentication For user
      authentication, it is expected to prevent from spoofing and
      internal injustice by installing risk-based authentication on not
      normal access ( such as a characteristic of terminal or route, and
      different time slot from usual ) and multi factor authentication
      on spoofing by leakage of single credential.  It is NOT
      recommended to deliver one-time-password by unprotected
      transmission line as email because there is a risk of
      impersonation or fraud on the transfer route.  Confirming
      telephone number by SMS was valid for verifying owner and
      reachability, but that has been RESTRICTED by NIST, so personal
      authentication technology such as possession identification and
      transaction authentication technology should be applied.  SMS may
      be one factor used to recovery account, but not measure to confirm
      the existence and authenticate.

   o  Multi-factor authentication, risk-based authentication It shall be
      carried out to register customer and set access controls strictly
      to avoid defraud customer funds, changing to fiat and money
      laundering by spoofing customers.

   o  Confirmation of intention according to the risk of operation To be
      consistent with the convenience of customers and safety of
      service, It shall be considered to make a different level to
      authenticate by risks of customer's operation.  For example, low-
      risk operations such as display balance of account or details of
      trade may be allowed by single-factor authentication, but update
      transactions such as trading coins or changing address or account
      shall be authenticated by an additional factor.  In addition,
      operations it may cause damages such as output coin or order of
      fiat transaction shall be ordered to confirm by additional
      authenticate or to confirm intention by an operator.

   o  Data preservation on deleting an account Cryptoassets custodians
      shall implement system be able to rollback after erasing for a
      certain period if customer stated spoofed or unauthorized access.
      Cryptoassets custodians shall delete the account if requested from
      a customer, but they also shall consider about risks that attacker
      spoofed to customer requests to delete the account.

   o  Signature key preservation on discontinue addresses Signature keys
      linked to an account shall not be deleted even if the address of
      cryptoassets has no value.  On a prediction for the general
      cryptoassets customer is allowed to send assets for any addresses
      and not technically prevented to send, signature keys for wallet
      stopped to use shall be taken back up for reuse because the
      possibility of receive coins to the address exists.

   o  Consideration for supplying APIs To set access control for
      operations by a customer, it shall be considered about not only
      operations of dialogue operations on the web but also APIs
      connecting from the application by smartphone and from external
      systems.  For providing APIs, It shall be implemented to consider
      cases that are difficult to get explicit approval from customer.
      It shall comply with best practices shared in the industry based
      on the attack risk peculiar to API.  For reference, it may be
      followed to Financial API by OpenID Foundation.

7.3.6.  Security controls on signature keys

   It SHALL conform to Section 10 "Cipher" of [ISO.27002:2013].

   Particularly, some security controls for the signature key, an issue
   specific to cryptoassets custodians, are closely related to the
   controls in other sub-sections in this section (e.g., Section 7.3.5).

   Amount of cryptoassets in Hot Wallet MUST be limited to a minimum
   amount and isolate their remain assets to another secure place, e.g.,
   Cold wallet.  The minimum amount means the amount which can be
   temporarily paid within the time it takes to withdraw the assets from
   the secure place.  Custodian can be refunded to the customers from
   the remain assets even if the assets in Hot Wallet leaks.

   Custodians MUST choose an appropriate cryptographic technology that
   has been evaluated its security by the third party in accordance with
   the purpose of use, as with general information systems.  Also, they
   MUST decide the life cycle of a signature key and MUST implement and
   operate appropriate controls.

7.3.6.1.  Basics of Signature Key Management

   In general, followings are required in the management of private keys
   including signature keys.

   o  They should be isolated from other informational assets.  Rigorous
      access control is mandatory.

   o  Limit the number of access to signature keys as minimum as
      possible.

   o  Be prepared for unintentional lost of signature keys.

   Followings are three basic security control to realize above.
   Additional security controls specific to crypto assets custodians are
   described in and after sub-sections Section 7.3.6.2.

   1.  State management of signature keys As described in Figure 2, a
       signature key has one of the multiple states generally, and it
       may be an active or inactive state in its operation.  The
       signature key MUST be in an active state when it is used for
       signing (or decryption).  It is recommended to enforce to input
       some secret information to activate from the inactive signature
       key.  This makes keeping the inactive signature key away from
       abuse if the adversary does not have the secret information.
       This method ensures also the security of the signature key
       against leakage and lost.  It is also recommended to minimize the
       term of activation to limit the risk of abuse as minimum as
       possible.  Unnecessary activation of the signature key increases
       the risk of abuse, leakage, and theft, though keeping the
       activation state is efficient from a business viewpoint.  On the
       other hand, frequent activation/inactivation may give impact to
       business efficiency.  It is important to consider the trade-off
       between the risk and business efficiency and provide clear key
       management policy to customers.

   2.  Administrator role separation and two-person rule It is a
       fundamental form of operation of a critical business process
       which uses the signature key to perform cryptographic operations
       by multiple parties to prevent internal frauds and errors.  For
       example, by setting separated privilege on digitally signing and
       approval to go into the area of signing operation, it becomes
       difficult for the single adversary to give a malicious digital
       signature without known by the third party.  Additionally, the
       enforcement of the two-person rule is effective security control
       to internal frauds and misoperations.

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


   3.  Backup of a signature key Lost of the signature key makes signing
       operations (by using the key) impossible any more.  Thus backup
       of the signature key is an important security control.  Since
       lost of the signature key makes signing operations impossible any
       more, backup of the signature key is an important security
       control.  On the other hand, risks of leakage and theft of backup
       keys MUST be considered.  It is needed to inactivate the backup
       keys.  Additionally, monitoring the blockchain whether to perform
       the outgoing-coin from that address to detect the inappropriate
       backup and the illegal-use of little-used address.

7.3.6.2.  Offline Key Management

   There is a type of offline key management (as known as "cold wallet")
   which isolates signature keys from the system network to prevent
   leakage and theft caused by the intrusion.


           Figure 4: Example of offline signature key management

   In this case, it REQUIREs some kind of offline operations to make the
   system use the signature key.

   Examples are a) it requires to move a signature key from the vault
   and to connect to the online system, b) input/output between online
   system and offline (key management) system does perform through a
   kind of storage, such a USB Flash Drive.

   If there is not an explicit approval process for the signature key
   used in the offline operation, anyone cannot stop the malicious
   transaction.  That is, for achieving this solution can prevent abuse,
   loss, and theft of signature keys, an explicit approval process is
   needed for this solution.

7.3.6.3.  Privilege separation of signature keys (Authorization process)

   Both privilege separation and two-person control of signature key
   management are effective as shown in Section 7.3.6.  In addition,
   there is multi-signature as a typical scheme for
   blockchain[BIP-0010][BIP-0011].  Multi-signature REQUIREs an
   authorization process with multi-stakeholders, and it is achieved by
   signing with the signature keys managed by each stakeholder.  Each
   stakeholder MUST verify other signatures technically if exists, and
   MUST validate the practical consistency of the transaction.

   Authorization process with multiple stakeholders can expect for a
   general countermeasure for malicious generation of a transaction.




Sato, et al.            Expires October 12, 2019               [Page 33]

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


   Note, however, that security controls for the leakage and/or loss of
   the signature key are still needed.

   Since a multi-signature scheme is provided by software, its logic and
   implementations are varied with some blockchain. e.g., multi-
   signature in Ethereum is implemented on smart contract, so that there
   are various implementations with each wallet software.  Also, some
   blockchains might not support multi-signature, therefore some
   cryptoassets could not adopt multi-signature.

   Also, there is another similar scheme "Secret Sharing Scheme" which
   is applicable to privilege separation.  This is a management
   technology in a distributed environment which has divided secret
   respectively, and one of the countermeasures for leakage and/or lost
   of signature key.  However, this scheme is rather a technology for
   single stakeholder with multi-location operation than multi-
   stakeholders, because it REQUIREs a validation scheme separately for
   the transaction to each stakeholder and management of the divided
   secret is rather depend to implementation than the signature key.

7.3.6.4.  Backup for Signature Key

   Backup is the most fundamental and effective measure against lost of
   signature key.  On the other hand, there are risks of leakage and
   loss of the backup device.

   These risks depend on the kind backup device, thus security controls
   on such devices MUST be considered independently.  Followings
   describe typical backup devices and leakage/theft risks associated
   with them.

   o  Cloning to the tamper-resistant cryptographic key management
      device If a signature key is managed by a tamper-resistant key
      management device (device X) and X has cloning function, cloning
      the key to another device Y is the most secure way to back up the
      key, where the cloning function is the technique to copy the key
      with keeping confidentiality to other devices than X and Y [_11].
      The implementation of the function is recommended to be evaluated/
      certified by certification programs like CMVP or FIPS 140.  Note
      that, the cryptographic algorithms supported by such tamper-
      resistant key management devices are limited and all crypto assets
      systems can utilize it, but it is one of the most secure ways of
      backup.

   o  Backup to storage for digital data Here, it is assumed to backup
      keys to storage like USB memory and DVD.  There are two types of
      operations; one is backup data is stored in movable devices in an
      offline manner, the other is backup data is stored in an online



Sato, et al.            Expires October 12, 2019               [Page 34]

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


      accessible manner.  If the device is movable, the possibility of
      steal and lost increases, thus the device MUST be kept in a
      cabinet or a vault with the key, and the access control to such
      cabinet/vault MUST be restricted.  Of the backup storage is
      online, risks of leakage and theft MUST be assumed as same as the
      key management function implementation inside the cryptoassets
      custodian.  In general, the same security control is recommended
      to such backup storage.  If there is some additional operation,
      for example, the backup device is inactivated except for the time
      of restore, the security control may be modified with considering
      the operating environment.  When it is not avoided the raw key
      data is outside of the key management function implementation, the
      custodian MUST deal with the problem of remained magnetics.

   o  Backup to paper There is a way to backup keys in an offline
      manner, to print them to papers as a QR code or other machine
      readable ways.  It is movable than storage for digital data and
      easy to identify.  There remains some risk of leakage and theft by
      taking a photo by smartphone and so on.

   o  Redundant with Sharing secret scheme Dividing of signature key to
      multiple parts, then managing them by multiple isolated systems is
      an effective measure to protect the keys against leakage and
      theft.  This document does not recommend a specific technique but
      RECOMMENDs to implement this control based on a certain level of
      security evaluation like a secret sharing scheme.  In that case,
      secure coding and mounting penetration test are REQUIRED to
      eliminate the implementation vulnerabilities.  This method is also
      effective for backup devices.

7.3.6.5.  Procurement of hardware wallet

   When introducing a wallet, it is RECOMMEND to use a product whose
   technical security is guaranteed like HSM which is originally used
   for existing PKI service etc.  However, some products may not be
   applicable currently because they often do not support a kind of
   cryptographic algorithm used by crypto assets.  Therefore, if
   introducing a wallet, it is RECOMMEND to operate in mind the
   following points with accepting the technical insufficiency:

   o  MUST not use hardware obtained through the untrusted procurement
      route.

   o  MUST apply the latest firmware and patches provided by the
      manufacturer.

   o  Initialization and key generation MUST do themselves, SHOULD NOT
      use default settings without careful considerations.

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


   o  MUST consider trustworthy of software instructing a sign to
      hardware wallet, especially whether it supports multi-signature or
      signing at the offline environment.

   Additionally, when custodian uses only hardware wallets in the
   marketplace, they MUST manage it according to section Section 7.3.4.

   On the other hand, hardware wallets MUST be subject to the third-
   party or independent certification scheme for security.  If
   introducing a software wallet from outside, it MUST consider the
   potentiality of containing malicious code, vulnerability, and bugs.

7.3.7.  Physical and environmental security

   Cryptoassets custodians system MUST follow section "11.  Physical and
   environmental security" on [ISO.27002:2013].

   Cryptoassets custodians system MUST consider strict physical security
   protections for the following elements.

   o  Media containing a signature key.  (Signature key management shown
      in Figure 1)

   o  Media containing a signature key for cold wallet environment.
      (Signature key management for offline management shown in
      Figure 4.)

   o  Media containing a backup data of signature key

   If the signature key mentioned above is stored in the deactivated
   state, and also key encryption key to activate the signature key is
   controlled separately, the media containing the key encryption key
   MUST be strictly managed.

   The security control to these signature key MUST be separated from
   the security control of the crypto assets custodian system.  In
   addition to this control, access to facilities and environments which
   store media containing a signature key or information required to
   operate the signature key MUST be restricted.  (See: Section 7.3.6)

   Furthermore, countermeasures to loss or theft for the operational
   device MUST be taken place if the administration or operation is
   executed from a remote place such as out of a facility.

7.3.8.  Operations security

   Crypto Assets Custodian systems MUST follow section "12.  Operations
   security" on [ISO.27002:2013].  In addition to the standard,
   cryptoassets custodian systems SHALL comply with the security
   controls mentioned following sections.

7.3.8.1.  Protections from malicious software (Related to ISO.27002:2013
          12.2)

   Detection and recovery measures of malware MUST be appropriately
   taken place according to configurations, the environment of
   cryptoassets custodian systems and confidentiality and importance of
   information handled in the systems.

   In general, one of the prevention measures for malware is applying
   security patches to operating systems, middlewares of cryptoassets
   custodian systems.  However, those patches MUST be applied upon
   sufficient confirmation based on the importance and urgency of a
   patch.  Moreover, testing and deployment procedure of security patch
   MUST be considered beforehand just in case attacks against the
   vulnerability have already confirmed.

7.3.8.2.  Backup (Related to ISO.27002:2013 12.3)

   Upon making a backup of systems, strict security controls to
   important data which suffered severe damage by leakages such as the
   signature key or master seed MUST be applied same as data subject to
   backup (e.g., an appropriate selection for storage, and enforcement
   of strict access controls.)  Security controls such as distributed
   storage mentioned in Section 7.3.6), proper privilege separation on
   backup and restore between operators and people making an
   authorization, and operation with multiple parties are also
   important.

7.3.8.3.  Logging and monitoring (Related to ISO.27002:2013 12.4)

   Crypto asset custodians systems MUST obtain/monitor/record logs
   properly (not limited to but include following logs).

   o  Logs on the environment where the cryptoassets custodian system
      Collecting and monitoring of event log outputted from the system
      components such as middleware, operating systems, and computers
      detects an abnormal state of environment where the system runs.
      Collected logs are used to investigate a cause in the case of the
      incident.

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


   o  Logs on the processing of components of crypto assets custodians
      system Collecting and monitoring of the processing logs from each
      component detects an abnormal state of crypto assets custodians
      system.  Collecting proper logs are used as a proof of proper
      processing inside the crypto assets custodians system, and also
      used to investigate a cause in a case of the incident.

   o  Access log of signature key Information such as date, a source
      terminal, an operator(not a role but information to identify an
      operator) MUST be obtained and recorded in a case of operations
      such as activation and deactivation of the signature key, access
      to the activated signature key and backup/restore.  Those records
      MUST be validated against the records such as operational
      procedures, operating hours, on a periodical inspection such as
      weekly inspection.  Moreover, in a case where the signature key is
      managed online, operational log such as the creation of a
      transaction signature by operator MUST be recorded and validated
      as well.

   o  Operational Log of a wallet managed by custodians Logs on
      remittance MUST be monitored real-time against the attempt of
      outgoing coin transfer in a case where the signature key and
      backup are unexpectedly leaked.  In a case where an unexpected
      remittance has occurred in one of the wallets, monitoring logs
      help timely detecting the incidents, suspending all signing
      operations, rechecking on other existing wallets, and migrating to
      other wallets using a different signature key.

   o  Access log of administration remote terminal If a remote access to
      cryptoassets custodian system is permitted, audit information such
      as date, source IP address, terminal information(e.g. terminal ID,
      latest result of security evaluation if it's possible) and
      destination IP address (or hostname) MUST be obtained and recorded
      for auditing which checks the accesses are from/in authorized
      range.

   o  Traffic log between the inside and the outside (e.g., the
      Internet) As mentioned in Section 7.3.9.1, Inbound traffic to
      cryotoassets custodian systems such as traffic from the Internet
      MUST be restricted to a permitted external network or permitted
      protocol.  Inbound traffic from disallowed network and traffic
      using disallowed protocol are denied at the firewall and other
      middleboxes.  Logs from that equipment are effective to protect
      customers from malicious access in terms of not only cryptoassets
      custodian system but also the information security.  Usually,
      outbound traffic from protected assets such as cryptoassets
      custodian systems to the Internet and other systems is not a
      subject to logging.  However, those logs are useful in cases such



Sato, et al.            Expires October 12, 2019               [Page 38]

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


      as investigations on incidents (e.g., malicious usage of the
      signature key, theft of signature key) and detection of the
      incident, so entire traffic or network flow are RECOMMENDED to be
      acquired according to protocols/destinations.

   o  Customers access log Customers access log MUST be obtained since
      those logs are used to detect malicious login or request.  Also,
      those logs are used as evidence in a case of incidents.  In a case
      of malicious login, custodians MUST notify its customer.

      *  Provide information about the malicious activity to customers
         Providing a feature to allow a customer to confirm login
         history, source IP address, region, and terminal information,
         and login notification by a push-notification or an e-mail are
         effective to detect malicious access after the incident.
         Feature protecting an account and alerting to a user in cases
         when detecting login from unknown source address or terminal,
         or detecting consecutive login to multiple accounts from the
         same source IP address, are effective to protect a user from
         malicious access.

   o  Images/videos recorded by a surveillance camera and entry/exit
      records Storing images/videos recorded by the surveillance camera
      and entry/exit records for proper period enables validating if
      physical safety control measures work properly after the incident.

   Detecting a malicious process execution (e.g., malware), malicious
   access, an abnormal state of cryptoassets custodians system by
   monitoring logs mentioned above comprehensively is important.
   Moreover, storing this evidence is important to prevent internal
   fraud and exonerate person involved from the charge.  Security
   Operation Center (SOC) may help to monitor the system.  Outsourcing
   to trusted operators about detection and notification of threats in
   the operation of SOC may be helpful.

7.3.9.  Communications security

   Cryptoassets custodians system MUST follow section "13.
   Communications security" on [ISO.27002:2013].

   Since assets are managed in a state accessible from the Internet on
   cryptoassets custodians system, preventive measures, detection
   measures, countermeasures and recovery measures as measures to
   prevent information leakage, MUST be considered according to the
   risk.

7.3.9.1.  Network security management (Related to ISO.27002:2013 clause
          13.1.1)

   As same as security control measures to general systems, measures
   such as a definition of a boundary to the external network,
   restriction of connection to a network system(e.g., firewall), stop
   unnecessary services or close unnecessary ports, obtaining and
   monitoring logs and malicious access detection MUST be considered and
   performed.

   For logs, logs of internal systems MUST be monitored to detect
   internal malicious access, as well as monitoring of boundary to the
   external network.  (See: Section 7.3.8.3)

   Secure communication with proper mutual authentication such as
   TLS(Transport Layer Security) MUST be used to protect from attacks to
   communication between modules such as eavesdropping and manipulation
   in a case where modules of cryptoassets custodians systems are
   remotely located.

7.3.9.2.  Network segmentation (Related to ISO.27002:2013 13.1.3)

   It is important to limit a connection between cryptoassets custodians
   systems and other systems/the Internet as minimum as possible to
   reduce the risk of exposing against attacks through a network.
   Measures as follow such as network segmentation and limitation to
   connection MUST be considered.

   o  Network isolation between custodians systems and other information
      systems

      *  Objectives: Preventing a connection to custodians systems
         through information systems used in daily operations, which has
         been compromised due to malware infections caused by external
         attacks such as targeted attack.

      *  Countermeasures: Isolate a network between information systems
         used in daily operations and custodians system by segmentation
         of network or limiting access.

   o  Network isolation at the boundary to the Internet

      *  Objective: Preventing access to critical information such as a
         signature key from attack through the Internet by minimizing
         and isolating modules which connect to the Internet.

      *  Countermeasures: Features which connects external services on
         the Internet to achieve the functionality of custodians system,

         transmit transactions or obtain blockchain data MUST be
         packaged as a module as minimum as possible or be isolated from
         other systems such as locating on DMZ.  Moreover, if modules
         are connecting to external services, access controls to those
         services MUST be adequately performed.

   o  Limitation on a terminal used in custodians system administration

      *  Objective: Preventing a malicious operation due to a hijacking
         of terminal used in custodians system administration.

      *  Countermeasures: Limiting a terminal which can connect to
         custodians system, such as a terminal to manage a custodians
         system administration function and a terminal running an
         administrative tool to order operation to custodians system.

7.3.9.3.  System acquisition, development and maintenance

   Cryptoassets custodians system MUST follow section "14.  System
   acquisition, development, and maintenance" on [ISO.27002:2013].

   Cryptoassets handled by cryptoassets custodians ranges from high
   liquidity cryptoassets dealt with by multiple custodians to emerging
   cryptoassets.  It is important to reduce a risk regarding system
   acquisition, development and maintenance in addition to
   [ISO.27002:2013] as characteristics of blockchain network used by
   those cryptoassets varies.  For example, the following
   countermeasures are effective.

   o  Software development method Secure software development method
      such as secure coding and code review MUST be used in the software
      development of the custodian system.  Code review not only with
      the development team but also with an operational team is
      effective to detect a vulnerability from the viewpoint of
      operation.

   o  Penetration test Conducting a penetration test helps to detect a
      known vulnerability at systems and results in obviating the
      attacking risk by the attacker in advance.

   o  Integration test with blockchain network Test MUST be performed
      not only with the test network of blockchain but also with the
      production network of the blockchain.  Risk assessment MUST be
      taken with an understanding of the limitation of test on the
      production network such as high-load test.

   o  Privilege separation on the operation Privilege separation such as
      limiting code reviewed software deployment to the production

      environment to the system operating team is effective to prevent
      tampering attacks from internal.

   o  Prohibiting using default (factory-configured) values Any factory-
      configured authentication information such as password MUST NOT be
      used regardless of hardware/software, development environment or
      production environment.

7.3.10.  Supplier relationships

   Cryptoassets custodians system MUST follow section "15.  Supplier
   relationships" on [ISO.27002:2013].

   Outsourcing wallet-related services may be a reasonable choice in a
   case technical security of those services has been secured.

   Administrative measures according to [ISO.27002:2013] MUST be taken
   in terms of outsourcing contractors or security controls of cloud
   service providers in cases where signature key in multi-signature is
   delegated to contractors or custodians system is implemented on cloud
   services.

7.3.11.  Information security incident management

   Cryptoassets custodians system MUST follow section "16.  Information
   security incident management" on [ISO.27002:2013].

   Since cyber attacks got complex, cyber security incidents
   unprecedented in the past could occur, especially in cryptoassets
   custodians.  In addition to security control measures as a
   preparation to expected threat in advance, Emergency response
   framework MUST be prepared in a case of incidents caused by an
   unknown threat.  For example, the establishment of internal
   CSIRT(Computer Security Incident Response Team) and building a
   relationship with external organizations.

7.3.12.  Information security aspect of business continuity management

   Cryptoassets custodians system MUST follow section "17.  Information
   security aspect of business continuity management" on
   [ISO.27002:2013].

   Requirements, Processes, Procedures and control measures to secure
   information security for the cryptoassets custodian in a case of the
   severe situation(such as disaster or crisis) MUST be established,
   documented, performed and maintained.  In this case, administrative
   measures in a case where countermeasures have performed or in a
   period of a severe situation MUST be verified periodically.

   Moreover, operators MUST consider to shut down the system
   situationally.

   o  In a case where facilities (including facilities used as an
      office) are unavailable

      *  Power outage

      *  Damages of building

      *  An act of nature (e.g., earthquakes, fires (including sprayed
         water for neighborhoods fire), water outage, flood)

      *  Other reasons (e.g., facilities are unavailable, or access to
         the facilities are prohibited by law/regulations/authorities.)

   o  In a case where it's difficult to continue the system

      *  In a case of becoming difficult to continue running an
         emergency electric generator.

      *  Long suspension of public transportation services, a pandemic
         of disease, lack of human resources by an act of nature.

      *  Failure of a communication network

      *  Failure of equipment

      *  Failure of the system (regardless of reasons such as failure of
         a program or cyber attacks)

      *  Loss of paper wallet or hardware wallet.

      *  Suspension of outsourcing contractor's business

      *  Leakage or loss of signature key

   o  In the case of becoming difficult to continue business

      *  Business-suspension order by law/regulations.

7.3.12.1.  Maintaining availability of the system

   Cryptoassets custodians system MUST be designed and implemented to
   have enough scalability and redundancy for users with consideration
   of a number of users, peak date/time of transactions, system response
   time, maintenance period/frequency and securing a human resource for
   operation.  Moreover, consideration for increasing the capacity of

Internet-DraGeneral Security Considerations for Cryptoassets  April 2019


   the system MUST be performed in advance with enough threshold (e.g.,
   number of transactions or memory usage during a peak period).

7.3.13.  Compliance

   Cryptoassets custodians MUST respect the guidelines or laws of the
   region or country.  (See Appendix 3 for a country of Japan)

7.4.  Other cryptoassets custodians system specific issues

7.4.1.  Advance notice to user for maintenance

   Cryptoassets custodians are RECOMMENDED to publish a notice of
   maintenance schedule in advance in a case where periodical schedule
   especially service suspension is planned in a night.  Also,
   Cryptoassets custodians are RECOMMENDED to provide information
   regarding the failure of the system at other FQDN/IP addresses to
   avert high volume traffic to the web server in addition to usual way
   of notice such as by e-mail or on the website, in a case of emergency
   maintenance.

   Moreover, cryptoassets custodians are RECOMMENDED to put forth an
   effort to minimize an affected area from a viewpoint of user
   protection in a case of service suspension caused by immediate issues
   such as attacks from external.
