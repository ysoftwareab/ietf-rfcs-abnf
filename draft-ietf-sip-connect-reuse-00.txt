Abstract

   When SIP entities use a connection oriented protocol to send a
   request, they typically originate their connections from an ephemeral
   port. The SIP protocol includes mechanisms which insure that
   responses to a request, and new requests sent in the original
   direction reuse an existing connection.  However, new requests sent
   in the opposite direction are unlikely to reuse the existing
   connection.  This frequently causes a pair of SIP entities to use one
   connection for requests sent in each direction, and can result in
   potential scaling and performance problems.  This document proposes
   requirements and a mechanism which address this deficiency.

1. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].

2. Introduction and Problem Statement

   SIP [1] entities can communicate using either unreliable/
   connectionless (ex: UDP) or reliable/connection-oriented (ex: TCP,
   SCTP [11]) transport protocols.  When SIP entities use a
   connection-oriented protocol (such as TCP or SCTP) to send a request,
   they typically originate their connections from an ephemeral port.

   In the following example, Entity A listens for SIP requests over TLS
   [4] on TCP port 5061 (the default port for SIP over TLS over TCP),
   but uses an ephemeral port (port 8293) for a new connection to Entity
   B.  These entities could be SIP User Agents or SIP Proxy Servers.

          +-----------+ 8293 (UAC)      5061 (UAS) +-----------+
          |           |--------------------------->|           |
          |  Entity   |                            |  Entity   |
          |     A     |                            |     B     |
          |           | 5061 (UAS)                 |           |
          +-----------+                            +-----------+

   The SIP protocol includes mechanisms which insure that responses to a
   request reuse the existing connection which is typically still
   available, and also includes provisions for reusing existing
   connections for other requests sent by the originator of the
   connection.  However, new requests sent in the opposite direction
   (routed from the target of the original connection toward the
   originator of the original connection) are unlikely to reuse the
   existing connection.  This frequently causes a pair of SIP entities
   to use one connection for requests sent in each direction, as shown
   below.

          +-----------+ 8293              5061 +-----------+
          |           |.......................>|           |
          |  Entity   |                        |  Entity   |
          |     A     | 5061              9741 |     B     |
          |           |<-----------------------|           |
          +-----------+                        +-----------+

   This extra pair of connections can result in potential scaling and
   performance problems.  For example, each new connection using TLS
   requires a TCP 3-way handshake, a handful of round-trips to establish
   TLS, and (typically) expensive asymetric authentication and key

   generation algorithms, and certificate verification.   This
   effectively doubles the load on each entity.  Setting up a second
   connection can also cause excessive delay (especially in networks
   with long round-trip times) for subsequent requests, even requests in
   the context of an existing dialog (for example a reINVITE or BYE
   after an initial INVITE, or a NOTIFY after a SUBSCRIBE [8] or a REFER
   [9]).

   Consider the call flow shown below where Proxy A and Proxy B use the
   Record-Route mechanism to stay involved in a dialog.  Proxy B will
   establish a new TLS connection just to send a BYE request.

      INVITE ->   create connection 1
      <- 200      response over connection 1
      ACK ->      reuse connection 1

      <- BYE      create connection 2
      -> 200      response over connection 2

   ReINVITEs are expected to be handled automatically and rapidly in
   order to avoid media and session state from being out of step.  If a
   reINVITE requires a new TLS connection, the reINVITE could be delayed
   by several extra round-trip times.  Depending on the round-trip time,
   this combined delay could be perceptible or even annoying to a human
   user. This is especially problematic for some common SIP call flows
   (for example, the recommended example flow in figure number 4 in 3pcc
   [7]) use many reINVITEs.

   Consider also a call flow where a handheld organizer sends a REFER
   request which establishes a dialog to a SIP phone.  Typically this
   would require a second connection back to the handheld to be
   established.

      REFER ->               connection 1
      <- 202                 connection 1
      <- NOTIFY              connection 2
      200 ->                 connection 2
                 INVITE ->
                 <- 200
      <- NOTIFY              connection 2
      200 ->                 connection 2

   Likewise when clusters or farms of cooperating SIP servers (for
   example proxy servers) are configured together, SIP entities have no
   way to prefer a server with an existing connection.  For example,
   Proxy server B has no mechanism to choose an existing connection with
   Proxy cluster A.

   The rules for handling the Transport layer described in Section 18 of
   SIP [1] do not associate incoming connections with the listening port
   which corresponds to the same SIP entity.  If the Tranport layer had
   some way to associate these connections, then request and responses
   originated from either node could reuse existing connections as shown
   below.

       existing connections for requests and repsonses originated from

       either peer in the connection.

   2.  A connection sharing mechanism SHOULD allow SIP entities to reuse
       existing connections with closely coupled nodes which act as a
       single SIP entity (for example a cluster of nodes acting as a
       proxy server).

   3.  A connection sharing mechanism MUST NOT require UACs (clients) to
       send all traffic from well-know SIP ports.

   4.  A connection sharing mechanism MUST NOT require configuring
       ephemeral port numbers in DNS.

   5.  A connection sharing mechanism MUST prevent unauthorized
       hijacking of other connections.

   6.  Connection sharing SHOULD persist across SIP transactions and
       dialogs.


4. Overview of Proposed Mechanism

   The proposed mechanism uses a new Via header field parameter.  The
   "alias" parameter is included in a Via header field value to indicate
   that the originator of the request wants to create a transport layer
   alias, so that the sent-by address becomes mapped to the current
   connection.

   Assuming the Via header field value shown below from the most recent
   request arrived over a connection from 60.54.32.1 port 8241:

      Via: SIP/2.0/TLS 60.54.32.1:5061;branch=z9hG4bKa7c8dze ;alias

   The transport layer creates an alias, such that any requests going to
   the "advertised address" (60.54.32.1 port 5061) are instead sent over
   the existing connection (to the "target" of the alias) which is
   coming from port 8241.  This sharing continues as long as the target
   connection stays up.  The SIP community recommends that servers keep
   connections up unless they need to reclaim resources, and that
   clients keep connections up as long as they are needed. Connection
   reuse works best when the client and the server maintain their
   connections for long periods of time.  SIP entities therefore SHOULD
   NOT drop connections on completion of a transaction or termination of
   a dialog.

   Likewise when clusters or farms of cooperating SIP servers (for
   example proxy servers) are configured together, the proposed
   mechanism allows a SIP entity to select a server with an existing

   connection.  With the proposed mechanism, Proxy B  sends requests for
   Proxy cluster A to node A2 with whom it shares an existing
   connection.

          +-----------+
          |           |
          |   Proxy   |
          |     A1    |                        +-----------+
          |           |                        |           |
          +-----------+                        |   Proxy   |
          +-----------+ 8293              5061 |     B     |
          |           |<======================>|           |
          |   Proxy   |                        +-----------+
          |     A2    |
          |           |
          +-----------+

   For example, on receipt of a message with the topmost Via header
   shown below, the transport layer creates an alias such that requests
   going to the advertised address (host-a.atlanta.com) are sent over
   the target connection (from 60.54.32.1:8241).

      Via: SIP/2.0/TLS host-a.atlanta.com;branch=z9hG4bK7c8dze ;alias

   As a result, this has an important interaction with the DNS
   resolution mechanisms for SIP described in RFC3263 [6].  When new
   requests arrive for host-a.atlanta.com, proxy B still needs to
   perform a DNS NAPTR lookup to select the transport. Once the
   transport is selected, an SRV lookup would ordinarily occur to find
   the appropriate port number. In this case, the transport layer uses a
   connection reuse alias instead of performing the SRV query.

   Below is a partial DNS zone file for atlanta.com.

   host-a2  IN A 60.54.32.2

   The existence of an alias parameter is treated as a request which
   asks the transport layer to create an alias (named by the sent-by
   parameter, which  could be a hostname) that points to the alias
   target (the current connection)

   This mechanism is fully backwards compatible with existing
   implementations.  If the proposed Via parameter is not understood by
   the recipient, it will be ignored and the two implementations will
   revert to current behavior (two connections).

4.1 Authorizing an alias request

   Authorizing connection aliases is essential to prevent connection
   hijacking.  For example a program run by a malicious user of a
   multiuser system could attempt to hijack SIP requests destined for
   the well-known SIP port from a large relay proxy.

   To correctly authorize an alias, both the active connection and the
   alias need to authenticate using the same credentials.  This could be
   accomplished using one of two mechanisms.  The first (and preferred)
   mechanism is using TLS mutual authentication, such that the
   subjectAltName of the originator certificate corresponds to both the
   current connection and the target address of the alias.   The Via
   sent-by address needs to be within the scope protected by the
   certificate presented by the originator during TLS mutual
   authentication and the received IP address needs be a valid IP
   address for the sent-by host or hosts.  In other words, the sent-by
   address and port combination MUST be resolvable from the
   subjectAltName of the originator certificate, and the received IP
   address MUST be resolvable from the sent-by address.  This is in
   addition to other requirements for TLS authentication and
   authorization discussed in SIP [1] and Locating SIP Servers [6].

   The second mechanism is to accept an alias if the target address of
   the alias is equivalent (using SIP comparison rules) to a valid
   Contact already registered by the same user.  This user could be
   authenticated through any SIP or TLS mechanism (ex: user certificate,
   or Kerberos [10]), but would typically use Digest authentication [5].
   For example, if Alice registers a Contact of 123.45.67.89:5061, she
   could inform Proxy 1 of the existence of a connection to her from
   Proxy 2.  This would allow her to preemptively originate TLS
   connections, as her user agent may not have access to a site
   certificate with which to authenticate incoming TLS connections.

                                               +-----------+

4.2 Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [3].  This document proposes to
   extend via-params to include a a new via-alias defined below.

      via-params = via-ttl / via-maddr / via-received / via-branch /
                   via-alias / via-extension

      via-alias  = "alias"


5. Security Considerations

   This document presents requirements and a  mechanism for reusing
   existing connections easily.  Connection reuse presents many
   opportunities for abuse and hijacking, but these attacks can be
   prevented if the guidelines in the authorization section are
   followed.

6. IANA Considerations

   This document introduces no additional considerations for IANA.
