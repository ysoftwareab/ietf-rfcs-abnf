                   IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options for DetNet
                   draft-pthubert-detnet-ipv6-hbh-02

Abstract

   RFC 8938, the Deterministic Networking Data Plane Framework relies on
   the 6-tuple to identify an IPv6 flow.  But the full DetNet operations
   require also the capabilities to signal meta-information such as a
   sequence within that flow, and to transport different types of
   packets along the same path with the same treatment, e.g.,
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance packets and/or multiple
   flows with fate and resource sharing.  This document introduces new
   Hop-by-Hop header options that can signal that information to the
   intermediate relays.

1.  Introduction

   Section 2 of the Deterministic Networking Problem Statement
   [DetNet-PS] introduces the concept of Deterministic Networking
   (DetNet) to the IETF.  DetNet extends the reach of lower layer
   technologies such as Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) [IEEE 802.1 TSN]
   and Timeslotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) [IEEE Std. 802.15.4] over IPv6
   and MPLS [RFC8938].

   The "Deterministic Networking Architecture" [DetNet-ARCHI] details
   the contribution of layer-3 protocols, and defines three planes: the
   Application (User) Plane, the Controller Plane, and the Network
   Plane.  [DetNet-ARCHI] places an emphasis on the centralized model
   whereby a controller instantiates per-flow state in the routers to
   perform adequate forwading operations so as to provide end-to-end
   reliability and bounded latency guarantees.

   The "6TiSCH Architecture" [6TiSCH-ARCHI] leverages RPL, the "Routing
   Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks" [RFC6550] and introduces
   concept of a Track as a highly redundant RPL Destination Oriented
   Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) rooted at the Track Ingress node, that
   can be installed using so-called projected routes [RPL-PDAO].  In
   that case, the TrackId is an index from a namespace associated to one
   IPv6 address of the Track Ingress node, and the Track that an IPv6
   packet follows is signaled by the combination of the source address

   (of the Track Ingress node), and the TrackID placed in a RPL Option
   [RFC6553] located in an IPv6 Hop-by-Hop (HbH) Options Header [IPv6]
   in the IPv6 packet.

   The "Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) Architecture/Framework"
   [RAW-ARCHI], extends the DetNet Network Plane to accomodate one or
   multiple hops of homogeneous or heterogeneous wireless technologies,
   e.g. a Wi-Fi6 Mesh or parallel radio access links combining Wi-Fi and
   5G.  The RAW Architecture reuses the concept of Track and introduces
   a new dataplane component, the Path Selection Engine (PSE), to
   dynamically select a subpath and maintain the required quality of
   service within a Track in the face of the rapid evolution of the
   medium properties.

   With [IPv6], the behavior of a router upon an IPv6 packet with a HbH
   Options Header has evolved, making the examination of the header by
   routers along the path optional, as opposed to previously mandatory.
   Additionally, the Option Type for any option in a HbH Options Header
   encodes in the leftmost bits whether a router that inspects the
   header should drop the packet or ignore the option when encountering
   an unknown option.  Combined, these capabilities enable a larger use
   of the header beyond the boundaries of a limited domain, as
   examplified by the change of behavior of the RPL data plane, that was
   changed to allow a packet with a RPL option to escape the RPL domain
   in the larger Internet [RFC9008].

   "IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options Processing Procedures" [HbH-PROCESS] further
   specifies the procedures for how IPv6 Hop-by-Hop options are
   processed to make their processing even more practical and increase
   their use in the Internet.  In that context, it makes sense to
   consider Hop-by-Hop Options to transport the information that is
   relevant to DetNet.

   The "Deterministic Networking Data Plane Framework" [RFC8938] relies
   on the 6-tuple to identify an IPv6 flow.  But the full DetNet
   operations require also the capabilities to signal meta-information
   such as a sequence within that flow, and to transport different types
   of packets along the same path with the same treatment.  For
   instance, it is required that Operations, Administration, and
   Maintenance (OAM) [RFC6291] packets and/or multiple flows share the
   same fate and resource sharing over the same Track or the same
   Traffic Engineered (TE) [RFC3272] DetNet path.

Internet-Draft             DetNet HbH Options                  June 2021


   This document introduces new Hop-by-Hop options that can signal
   DetNet path and sequencing information to the intermediate relays in
   an abstract form that is independent of the transport layer.
   Transported in IPv6 HbH Options, the DetNet information is available
   early in the header chain of the packet and presented and added as
   part of a service instance encapsulation by the Ingress of the DetNet
   path and accessed by the intermediate DetNet relay nodes.

2.  Terminology

   Timestamp semantics and timestamp formats used in this document are
   defined in "Guidelines for Defining Packet Timestamps" [RFC8877].

   The Deterministic Networking terms used in this document are defined
   in the "Deterministic Networking Architecture" [DetNet-ARCHI].

   The terms Track and TrackID are defined in the "6TiSCH Architecture"
   [6TiSCH-ARCHI].

3.  The DetNet Options

   This document defines a number of IPv6 options to be placed in a HbH
   Options Header; the format of these options follow the generic
   definition in section 4.2 of [IPv6].

3.1.  DetNet Sequencing Option

   A typical packet sequence can be expressed uniquely as a wrapping
   counter, represented as an unsigned integer in the option.  In that
   case, the size of the representation MUST be large enough to cover at
   least 3 times the upper bound on out-of-order packet delivery in
   terms of number of packets.

   This specification also allows to use a time stamp for the packet
   sequencing following the recommendations in [RFC8877].  This can be
   accomplished by utilizing the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) format
   defined in IEEE Std. 1588 [IEEE Std. 1588] or Network Time Protocol
   (NTP) [RFC5905] formats.  In that case, the timestamp resolution at
   the origin node that builds the option MUST be fine enough to ensure
   that two consecutive packets are never stamped with the same value.
   There is no requirement for this particular stamping function that
   the sense of time at the origin node is synchronized with the rest of
   the DetNet network.

   This specification also allows for an hybrid model with a coarse
   grained packet sequence within a coarse grained time stamp.  In that
   case, both a time stamp option and a wrapping counter options are
   found, and the counter is used to compare packets with the same time

   stamp and ignored otherwise In that case, the size of the
   representation of the counter MUST be large enough to cover at least
   3 times the number of packets that may be sent with the same value of
   time stamp.

   6TiSCH [6TiSCH-ARCHI] and RAW [RAW-ARCHI] signal a Track using a RPL
   Option [RFC6553] with a RPLInstanceID used as TrackID.  This
   specification reuses the RPL option as a method to signal a DetNet
   path.  In that case, the Projected-Route 'P' flag [RPL-PDAO] MUST be
   set to 1, and the O, R, F flags, as well as the Sender Rank field,
   MUST be set to 0 by the originator, forwarded as-is, and ignored on
   reception.

3.3.  DetNet Local Path Option

   In complement to the RPL option, this specification defines a
   protocol-independent Local Path Identifier, which is also taken from
   a namespace indicated by the IPv6 source address of the packet.

3.4.  DetNet Global Path Option

   The DetNet Global Path Option transports a global path identifier
   which is taken from a namespace indicated by the Origin Autonomous
   System (AS).  When the DetNet path is contained within a single AS,
   the Origin Autonomous System field can be left to 0 indicating local
   AS.
