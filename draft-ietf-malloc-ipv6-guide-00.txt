Abstract 
    
   With the current multicast address architecture and the proposed 
   multicast address architecture, a set of guidelines is needed for 
   multicast address allocation servers to use in assigning IPv6 
   multicast addresses.  The purpose of these rules is to reduce the 
   possibility of address collision not only at layer 3, but also on 
   devices at layer 2.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

Internet Draft   IPv6 Multicast Address Architecture          May 2000 
    
   With the current multicast address architecture [RFC 2373] and the 
   multicast address architecture proposed in [NEW ARCH], a set of 
   guidelines is needed for multicast address allocation servers 
   [MALLOC] to use in assigning IPv6 multicast addresses.  The purpose 
   of these rules is to reduce the possibility of address collision not 
   only at layer 3, but also on devices at layer 2. 
    
   These guidelines specify how the lowest 32 bits of the IPv6 
   multicast address are chosen and assigned.  The guidelines specify 
   several mechanisms that can be used to determine the lowest 32 bits 
   of the multicast address.  By having several mechanisms of varying 
   complexity, implementers and operators have the flexibility to 
   choose a mechanism that is appropriate for their application. 
 
3. Assignment of New IPv6 Multicast Addresses 
    
   The current approach [RFC 2464] to map IPv6 multicast addresses into 
   IEEE 802 MAC addresses takes the low order 32 bits of the IPv6 
   multicast address and uses it to create a MAC address.  Group ID's 
   less than or equal to 32 bits long will generate unique MAC 
   addresses.   
    
   The goal of this document is to present several mechanisms 
   implementers and operators can use to select the group ID portion of 
   the address so that the possibility of collisions at the IP layer 
   and at the IEEE 802 layer is reduced.  The following section 
   presents several different mechanism of varying complexity that can 
   be used to select an appropriate group ID. 
    
    
4. Group ID Selection Guidelines 
    
   The following guidelines assume that the upper 96 bits of the IPv6 
   multicast address have been set up.  For unicast network prefix-
   based multicast addresses, the set up of those bits is done in the 
   following manner: 
    
           o  An IPv6 multicast address prefix is initialized with the 
              appropriate flags and scope fields 
           o  The IPv6 Network Prefix is inserted into the address and 
              the plen field is set.  The Network Prefix is obtained 
              from the periodic Router Advertisements. 
           o  The reserved field in the IPv6 multicast address is set 
              to zero 
    
   With the multicast address architecture in [RFC 2373], the set up of 
   those bits is done in the following manner: 
    
           o  An IPv6 multicast address prefix is initialized with the 
              appropriate flags and scope fields

           o  The reserved field in the IPv6 multicast address is set 
              to zero 
    
   The group ID portion of the address is set using either a pseudo-
   random 32-bit number or a 32-bit number created using the guidelines 
   in [RFC 1750].  Possible approaches to creating a pseudo-random 
   number are to use an MD5 message-digest [RFC 1321] or portions of an 
   NTP [RFC 1305] timestamp. 
    
   The assignment of the group ID portion of the address SHOULD take 
   care to ensure that the generated multicast address does not share a 
   group ID with a permanently assigned IPv6 multicast address.  The 
   permanently assigned multicast addresses are defined in [RFC 2375]. 
    
   Requests for more than one multicast address SHOULD be handled 
   atomically.  One possible approach is to use the initial group ID, 
   created using the guidelines above, as the base address in a 
   contiguous block of multicast addresses.  Another approach is to 
   create multiple group IDs and generate the appropriate multicast 
   addresses. 
    
                  
5. Multicast Address Lifetime 
    
   The lifetime of the assignment of unicast prefix-based multicast 
   addresses MUST be less than or equal to the Valid Lifetime field in 
   the Prefix Information option contained in the Neighbor Discovery 
   Router Advertisement message [RFC 2461]. 
    
    
6. Security Considerations 
    
   This document does not have any direct impact on Internet 
   infrastructure security.
