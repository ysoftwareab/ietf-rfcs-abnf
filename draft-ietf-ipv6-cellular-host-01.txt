Abstract 
    
   As increasing numbers of cellular hosts are being connected to the 
   Internet, IPv6 becomes necessary. Examples of such hosts are devices 
   used with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) or Universal Mobile 
   Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks. Standardization 
   organizations are also making IPv6 mandatory in their newest 
   specifications. However, the concept of IPv6 covers many aspects, 
   numerous standards, a number of different situations and is still 
   evolving. A rapid adoption of IPv6 is desired for cellular hosts. In 
   addition, the characteristics of cellular links in terms of 
   bandwidth, cost and delay put special requirements on IPv6. For 
   these reasons it is necessary to understand how the IPv6 deployment 
   in second and third generation cellular networks will start and 
   which parts of IPv6 are used in which situations. This informational 
   document lists basic components of IPv6 functionality and discusses 
   some issues relating to the use of these components when operating 
   over cellular interfaces.

Internet Draft      IPv6 for 2G and 3G Cellular Hosts    April 10, 2002 
 
 
1 Introduction 
         
   Technologies such as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), UMTS 
   (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), and CDMA2000 (Code 
   Division Multiple Access 2000, the name identifying the third 
   generation technology of IS-95 CDMA standard and ANSI-41 network) 
   are making it possible for cellular hosts to have an always-on 
   connection to the Internet. IPv6 becomes necessary, as it is 
   expected that the number of such cellular hosts will increase 
   rapidly. Standardization organizations working with cellular 
   technologies have recognized this and are making IPv6 mandatory in 
   their newest specifications. 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership 
   Project) has specified IPv6 support [3GPP-IPv6] as mandatory for 
   future UMTS IP multimedia hosts [3GPP-IMS]. 
    
   Support for IPv6 and the introduction of UMTS starts with 3GPP 
   Release 99 networks and hosts. IPv6 is specified as the only IP 
   version supported in Release 5 for IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).  
    
   Additionally, there is interest within the IPv6 working group about 
   how IPv6 will be used by other organizations.  For example, the 
   working group has developed Recommendations for IPv6 in 3GPP 
   Standards [IPv6-3GPP]. 
    
   The functionality necessary to provide the connectivity through the 
   cellular interface is outlined in this draft. For this document, the 
   cellular interface is considered to be the interface that is used to 
   connect to a cellular access network (e.g. GPRS or UMTS) and 
   provides connectivity to IPv6 networks. The description is made from 
   a cellular host point of view. 
    
1.1 Scope of this Document 
    
   This document lists IPv6 specifications and discusses some issues 
   relating to the use of these specifications when operating over 
   cellular interfaces. Such a specification is necessary in order to 
   determine the optimal way to use IPv6 in a cellular environment. 
   Important considerations are given in order to eliminate unnecessary 
   user confusion with regards to configuration options, ensure 
   interoperability and to provide an easy reference for those 
   implementing IPv6 in a cellular host. The overarching desire is to 
   ensure that cellular hosts are good citizens on the Internet.  
    
   The main audiences of this document are the implementers who need 
   guidance on what to implement in their cellular hosts, and cellular 
   standardization organizations that need a reference to how IPv6 
   should be used in their specifications.  Note that, at the time of 
   writing this document, there is on-going work to define a general-
   purpose requirements document for IPv6 nodes.

Internet Draft      IPv6 for 2G and 3G Cellular Hosts    April 10, 2002 
 
 
   For the purposes of this document, a cellular host is considered to 
   be a host with a cellular interface (for example, one based on GPRS 
   or UMTS standards). There are different ways to implement cellular 
   hosts: 
 
      - The host can be a "closed 2G or 3G host" with a very compact 
         size and optimized applications, with no possibility to add 
         or download applications that can have IP communications. An 
         example of such a host is a very simple form of a mobile 
         phone. 
      -  The host can be an "open 2G or 3G host" with a compact size, 
         but where it is possible to download applications; such as a 
         PDA-type of phone.  
    
   If a cellular host has additional interfaces on which IP is used, 
   (such as Ethernet, WLAN, Bluetooth, etc.) then there may be 
   additional requirements for the device, beyond what is discussed in 
   this document.  Additionally, this document does not make any 
   recommendations on the functionality required on laptop computers 
   having a cellular interface such as a PC card, other than 
   recommending link specific behavior on the cellular link. 
    
   This document discusses IPv6 functionality as specified when this 
   draft is written. Ongoing work on IPv6 may affect what is needed 
   from future hosts. The reader should also be advised other relevant 
   work exists for various other layers. Examples of this include the 
   header compression work done in the IETF ROHC group, or the TCP work 
   in [TCPWIRELESS].

1.4 Cellular Host IPv6 Features  
         
   This specification defines IPv6 features for cellular hosts in three 
   groups. 
    
     Basic IP 
    
          In this group, we describe the basic parts of IPv6.  
    
     IP Security 
      
          In this group, we discuss IP Security parts, as well as 
          discuss the suitability of various security functions for 
          different applications in cellular hosts. 
    
     IP Mobility 
    
          In this group, we discuss IP layer mobility functionality, 
          and its usage scenarios in cellular hosts.  
           
2 Basic IP 
      
2.1 RFC1981 - Path MTU Discovery for IP Version 6 
      
   Path MTU Discovery [RFC-1981] may be used. 
    
   The IPv6 specification [RFC-2460] states in chapter 5 that "a 
   minimal IPv6 implementation (e.g., in a boot ROM) may simply 
   restrict itself to sending packets no larger than 1280 octets, and 
   omit implementation of Path MTU Discovery." 
    
   If Path MTU Discovery is not implemented then the sending packet 
   size is limited to 1280 octets (standard limit in [RFC-2460]). 
   However, if this is done, the cellular host must be able to receive 
   packets with size up to the link MTU before reassembly. This is 
   because the node at the other side of the link has no way of knowing 
   less than the MTU is accepted. 
         
2.2 RFC2373 - IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture 
         
   The IPv6 Addressing Architecture [RFC-2373] is a mandatory part of 
   IPv6. IPX & NSAP addresses should not be used. Currently, this 
   standard is being updated by [ADDRARCHv3]; therefore, when this 
   draft is approved, this must be supported as well.

Internet Draft      IPv6 for 2G and 3G Cellular Hosts    April 10, 2002 
 
 
    
2.3 RFC2460 - Internet Protocol Version 6 
         
   The Internet Protocol Version 6 is specified in [RFC-2460]. This 
   standard is a mandatory part of IPv6.  
    
   By definition, a cellular host acts as a host, not as a router.  
   Implementation requirements for a cellular router are not defined in 
   this document. 
    
   Consequently, the cellular host must implement all non-router packet 
   receive processing as described in RFC 2460.  This includes the 
   generation of ICMPv6 error reports, and the processing of at least 
   the following extension headers: 
    
     - Hop-by-Hop Options header: at least the Pad1 and PadN options 
     - Destination Options header: at least the Pad1 and PadN options 
     - Routing (Type 0) header: final destination (host) processing 
       only 
     - Fragment header 
     - AH and ESP headers (see also a discussion on the use of IPsec 
       for various purposes in Section 3) 
     - The No Next Header value 
    
   Unrecognized options in Hop-by-Hop Options or Destination Options 
   extensions must be processed as described in RFC 2460. 
        
   The cellular host must follow the packet transmission rules in RFC 
   2460.  
    
   The cellular host must always be able to receive fragment headers. 
   However, if it does not implement path MTU (Section 2.1) it may not 
   need to send fragment headers. 
    
   Cellular Hosts will act as the destination when processing the 
   Routing Header. This will also ensure that the cellular hosts will 
   not be inappropriately used as relays or components in Denial-of-
   Service attacks. Acting as the destination involves the following. 
   The cellular hosts must check the Segments Left field in the header, 
   and proceed if it is zero or one and the next address is one of the 
   host's addresses. If not, however, the host must implement error 
   checks as specified in section 4.4 of RFC 2460. There is no need for 
   the host to send Routing Headers. 
    
2.4 RFC2461 - Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 
         
   Neighbor Discovery is described in [RFC-2461]. This standard is a 
   mandatory part of IPv6. 
         
2.4.1 Neighbor Discovery in 3GPP 
      
 
Manyfolks                                                    [Page 6] 
 
 
Internet Draft      IPv6 for 2G and 3G Cellular Hosts    April 10, 2002 
 
 
   In cellular networks, some Neighbor Discovery messages can cause 
   unnecessary traffic and consume valuable (limited) bandwidth. All 
   current cellular links resemble a point-to-point link; hence, the 
   host's only neighbor on the cellular link is the default router that 
   is already known through Router Discovery. This router most likely 
   will not be a final destination for the host's traffic. 
   Additionally, due to special characteristics of the cellular link, 
   lower layer connectivity information should make it unnecessary to 
   track the reachability of the router. Therefore, Neighbor 
   Solicitation and Advertisement messages may be used for the cellular 
   interface, but are not required. In addition, a cellular host should 
   not send the link layer sub-option on its cellular interface, and 
   should silently ignore it if received on the same interface. 
    
   3GPP hosts only need to use Router Solicitations and Router 
   Advertisements for 3GPP IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration. Neighbor 
   Solicitations and Advertisements may be used for Neighbor 
   Unreachability Detection (NUD). They are not required for 3GPP IPv6 
   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration, since address duplication is 
   not possible in this address assignment mechanism (see section 
   2.5.1). 
         
2.5 RFC2462 - IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration 
    
   IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration is defined in [RFC-2462]. 
   This standard is a mandatory part of IPv6.  
    
2.5.1 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in 3GPP  
 
   A 3GPP cellular host must process a Router Advertisement as stated 
   in chapter 5.5.3 of [RFC-2462].  
    
   These cellular hosts need not perform Duplicate Address Detection on 
   its cellular interface, as each delegated prefix is unique within 
   its scope when allocated using the 3GPP IPv6 Stateless Address 
   Autoconfiguration. 
    
   See appendix B for more details on 3GPP IPv6 Stateless Address 
   Autoconfiguration. 
 
2.6 RFC2463 - Internet Control Message Protocol for the IPv6 
         
   The Internet Control Message Protocol for the IPv6 is defined [RFC-
   2463]. This standard is a mandatory part of IPv6.  Currently, this 
   work is being updated. 
    
   As per RFC 2463 section 2, ICMPv6 requirements must be fully 
   implemented by every IPv6 node. See also Section 3 for an 
   explanation of the use of IPsec for protecting ICMPv6 
   communications.

Internet Draft      IPv6 for 2G and 3G Cellular Hosts    April 10, 2002 
 
 
2.7 RFC2472 - IP version 6 over PPP 
      
   IPv6 over PPP [RFC-2472] must be supported for cellular hosts that 
   implement PPP. 
    
2.7.1 IP version 6 over PPP in 3GPP 
    
   A 3GPP cellular host must support the IPv6CP interface identifier 
   option. This option is needed to be able to connect other non-3GPP 
   devices to the Internet using a PPP link between the 3GPP device 
   (MT) and other devices (TE, e.g. a laptop). The MT performs the PDP 
   Context activation based on a request from the TE. This results in 
   an interface identifier to be suggested by the MT to the TE, using 
   the IPv6CP option. To avoid any duplication in link-local addresses 
   between the TE and the GGSN, the MT must always reject other 
   suggested interface identifiers by the TE. This results in the TE 
   always using the interface identifier suggested by the GGSN for its 
   link-local address.  
    
2.8 RFC2473 - Generic Packet Tunneling in IPv6 Specification 
 
   Generic Packet Tunneling [RFC-2473] may be supported if needed for 
   transition mechanisms and must be supported if the Mobile Node 
   functionality of Mobile IP is implemented. 
    
2.9 RFC2710 - Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6 
    
   Multicast Listener Discovery [RFC-2710] may be supported, if the 
   cellular host supports multicast functionality. There is no need for 
   MLD if the host supports only the well-known multicast addresses, 
   such as the All Nodes Address or Solicited Node Multicast Address. 
    
2.10 RFC2711 - IPv6 Router Alert Option 
    
   The Router Alert Option [RFC-2711] may be supported. If the cellular 
   host does not perform packet forwarding at the IP layer, the 
   receiver side of the Router Alert Option may be omitted. 
         
2.11 RFC2893 - Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers 
    
   [RFC-2893] specifies a number of transition mechanisms for IPv6 hosts. 
   Cellular hosts may support the dual stack mechanism mentioned in this 
   standard. This also includes resolving addresses from the DNS and 
   selecting the type of address for the correspondent host (IPv4 vs. 
   IPv6). Cellular hosts should not support configured or automatic 
   tunnels to avoid unnecessary tunneling over the air interface.  
    
2.12 RFC3041 - Privacy Extensions for Address Configuration in IPv6

Internet Draft      IPv6 for 2G and 3G Cellular Hosts    April 10, 2002 
 
 
   Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC-
   3041] may be used. Refer to section 5 for a discussion of the 
   benefits of privacy extensions in a 3GPP environment. 
         
2.13 RFC3056 - Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds 
    
   Connection of IPv6 domains via IPv4 clouds [RFC-3056] should not be 
   supported to avoid unnecessary tunneling over the air interface. For 
   a cellular host, this specification would mean capability to create 
   6to4 tunnels starting from the cellular host itself. In a cellular 
   environment, tunneling over the air interface should be minimized. 
   Hence, 6to4 tunneling should be carried out by intermediate 6to4 
   routers rather than the cellular host.  
         
2.14 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) 
    
   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 [DHCPv6] may be 
   used. DHCPv6 is not needed when IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration is 
   used, and no other functions of DHCPv6 are used. 
    
2.15 Default Address Selection for IPv6 
    
   Default Address Selection for IPv6 [DEFADDR] should be supported 
   since cellular hosts can have more than one IPv6 address.  
 
2.16 DNS 
    
   Cellular hosts should support DNS, as described in [RFC-1034], [RFC-
   1035] and [RFC-1886]. 
    
   If DNS is used, a cellular host should perform DNS requests in the 
   recursive mode, to limit signaling over the air interface. 
    
3 IP Security 
    
   IPsec [RFC-2401] is a fundamental part of IPv6, and support for AH 
   and ESP is described as mandatory in the standards. 
    
   The first part of this section discusses the applicability of IP 
   Security and other security mechanisms for certain types of common 
   tasks in cellular hosts. The second part, subsections 3.1 to 3.13, 
   lists the RFCs related to IPsec and discusses the use of these parts 
   of IPsec in a cellular context. 
    
   In general, the need to use a security mechanism depends on the 
   intended application for it. In order to gain an understanding on 
   where different security mechanisms are useful and what limitations 
   they have, we discuss a few example applications common in cellular 
   hosts: end-to-end VPNs, web browsing, and IPv6 control message 
   protection. We cannot list all possible services here, and in 
   general, we expect application protocol standards to have

   requirements on what security services they must employ. For new 
   applications, it is strongly suggested that some of the existing set 
   of security mechanisms be used rather than new ones developed, 
   adding to the amount of memory and implementation effort needed for 
   a host supporting multiple services. Note that cellular hosts able 
   to download applications must be prepared to offer sufficient 
   security services for these applications regardless of the needs of 
   the initial set of applications in those hosts. 
    
   Cellular hosts that provide an end-to-end VPN service to a corporate 
   intranet, for example, should use IPsec and IKE for this purpose. An 
   IPsec Remote Access solution should also be supported. The set of 
   standards necessary for such an "application" are discussed in 
   sections 3.1 to 3.13. 
    
   Note that in other applications it may not be necessary to use IKE. 
   For instance, hosts may use IPsec ESP [RFC-2406] for protecting SIP 
   signaling in the IMS [3GPP-ACC] but provide authentication and key 
   management through another mechanism such as UMTS AKA 
   (Authentication and Key Agreement) [UMTS-AKA]. 
    
   Cellular hosts that provide a web browsing service should use TLS 
   [RFC-2246]. The fact that just TLS should be the protocol to provide 
   web security relates to current deployment and the suitability of 
   the single-side certificate trust model for this application. 
   Without security, the user would be blocked from some of the sites - 
   such as e-commerce sites - that do require security.  
    
   Cellular hosts may also wish to protect their IPv6 control 
   communications, e.g. ICMPv6 or Neighbor Discovery. IPsec is the 
   recommended approach for this purpose, and it works well towards a 
   specific home server, such as a corporate gateway. However, neither 
   IPsec nor other existing security services are very helpful in 
   securing communications to the local next hop routers (GGSNs) or 
   other 3GPP nodes in a global roaming situation. This is in part due 
   to the difficulties in establishing a suitable trust infrastructure 
   for creating the necessary Security Associations (SAs). In order for 
   a host to create a SA with the next hop router for the purposes of 
   securing the router and neighbor discovery tasks would mean the 
   following. First, both the routers and all cellular hosts would have 
   to be registered to a PKI system. Second, a trusted Certificate 
   Authority (CA) would have to be found that encompasses both the 
   visiting cellular host of an operator as well as the infrastructure 
   of another operator. It is not clear if this is possible with 
   today's technology. Furthermore, as [ICMPIKEv6] points out, dynamic 
   SA negotiation can't be used for the protection of the first few 
   connectivity establishment messages in ICMPv6. Roaming nodes may 
   have difficulty providing manually keyed SAs with their current 
   local routers. For these reasons, it is typically not possible to 
   provide pure IPv6 router and infrastructure protection except in a 
   very limited manner.

   The following sections list standards related to the IPsec 
   functionality, and discuss their applicability in a cellular 
   context. The latter discussion focuses on the use of IPsec as a VPN 
   mechanism towards a particular corporate network, and does not 
   necessarily apply to other usage scenarios; in some other context, a 
   different set of protocols may need to be employed. In particular, 
   the below discussion is not relevant for applications that use other 
   security services than IPsec. 
         
3.1 RFC2104 - HMAC: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication 
    
   This standard [RFC-2104] must be supported. It is referenced by RFC 
   2403 that describes how IPsec protects the integrity of packets. 
    
3.2 RFC2401 - Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol 
         
   This standard [RFC-2401] must be supported. 
         
3.3 RFC2402 - IP Authentication Header 
         
   This standard [RFC-2402] must be supported. The IPsec WG has 
   discussed the role of AH in the future, and it is possible that it 
   will be made optional in the future versions of the IPsec protocol 
   set. Implementers are recommended to take this in account. 
    
3.4 RFC2403 - The Use of HMAC-MD5-96 within ESP and AH 
         
   This standard [RFC-2403] must be supported. 
 
3.5 RFC2404 - The Use of HMAC-SHA-96 within ESP and AH 
         
   This standard [RFC-2404] must be supported. 
         
3.6 RFC2405 - The ESP DES-CBC Cipher Algorithm With Explicit IV   
         
   This standard [RFC-2405] may be supported. It is, however, 
   recommended that stronger algorithms than DES be used.  Algorithms, 
   such as AES, are undergoing work in the IPsec working group. 
         
3.7 RFC2406 - IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) 
    
   This standard [RFC-2406] must be supported. 
         
3.8 RFC2407 - The Internet IP Security DoI for ISAKMP 
    
   Automatic key management, [RFC-2408] and [RFC-2409], is not a 
   mandatory part of the IP Security Architecture. Note, however, that 
   in the cellular environment the IP addresses of a host may change 
   dynamically. For this reason the use of manually configured Security 
   Associations is not practical, as the newest host address would have

Internet Draft      IPv6 for 2G and 3G Cellular Hosts    April 10, 2002 
 
 
   to be updated to the SA database of the peer as well. Any key 
   management mechanism may be used, but ISAKMP/IKE is the standard one 
   and recommended here for the VPN service.  
    
   It is likely that several simplifying assumptions can be made in the 
   cellular environment, with respect to the mandated parts of the IP 
   Security DoI, ISAKMP, and IKE. Although work on such simplifications 
   would be useful, is not described here. 
    
3.9 RFC2408 û Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol  
    
   This standard [RFC-2408] may be supported according to the IPv6 
   standards, but may be necessary in some applications, as described 
   in Section 3.8. 
    
3.10 RFC2409 - The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)  
    
   This standard [RFC-2409] may be supported according to the IPv6 
   standards, but may be necessary in some applications, as described 
   in Section 3.8. 
    
   Interactions with the ICMPv6 packets and IPsec policies may cause 
   unexpected behavior for IKE-based SA negotiation unless some special 
   handling is performed in the implementations. 
    
   The ICMPv6 protocol provides many functions, which in IPv4 were 
   either non-existent or provided by lower layers. For instance, IPv6 
   implements address resolution using an IP packet, ICMPv6 Neighbor 
   Solicitation message. In contrast, IPv4 uses an ARP message at a 
   lower layer. 
    
   The IPsec architecture has a Security Policy Database that specifies 
   which traffic is protected, and how. It turns out that the 
   specification of policies in the presence of ICMPv6 traffic is not 
   easy. For instance, a simple policy of protecting all traffic 
   between two hosts on the same network would trap even address 
   resolution messages, leading to a situation where IKE can't 
   establish a Security Association since in order to send the IKE UDP 
   packets one would have had to send the Neighbor Solicitation 
   Message, which would have required an SA. 
    
   In order to avoid this problem, this specification recommends that 
   Neighbor Solicitation, Neighbor Advertisement, Router Solicitation, 
   and Router Advertisement messages must not lead to the use of IKE-
   based SA negotiation. The Redirect message should not lead to the 
   use of IKE-based SA negotiation. Other ICMPv6 messages may use IKE-
   based SA negotiation as is desired in the Security Policy Data Base. 
    
3.11 RFC2410 - The NULL Encryption Algorithm & its Use With IPsec 
    
   This standard [RFC-2410] must be supported.

3.12 RFC2451 - The ESP CBC-Mode Cipher Algorithms  
    
   This standard [RFC-2451] must be supported if encryption algorithms 
   other than DES are implemented, e.g.: CAST-128, RC5, IDEA, Blowfish, 
   3DES. 
    
3.13 IP Security Remote Access      
    
   IPsec is often used in situations where legacy RADIUS or other 
   authentication is desired instead of PKI-based authentication. 
   Cellular hosts offering DES services to corporate intranets should 
   support remote access solutions, which are currently being defined 
   by the IETF. 
    
4 IP Mobility  
    
   Mobile IPv6 manages IP mobility resulting from the change in Care of 
   Address when a host moves within the Internet topology.  
    
   However, at the time this is being written Mobile IPv6 specification 
   is not yet a standard and may change. Some aspects of securing MIPv6 
   are also currently being debated. Yet, at the same time the first 
   cellular IPv6 hosts need to be produced. The implementers should 
   therefore consider the implications of relying on preliminary 
   information. Appendix D discusses certain functions that are 
   particularly prone to modifications, and describe the tradeoffs 
   involved. 
    
5 Security Considerations 
 
   This document does not specify any new protocols or functionality, 
   and as such, it does not introduce any new security vulnerabilities. 
   However, specific profiles of IPv6 functionality are proposed for 
   different situations, and vulnerabilities may open or close 
   depending on which functionality is included and what is not. There 
   are also aspects of the cellular environment that make certain types 
   of vulnerabilities more severe. In the following, we discuss both of 
   these issues: 
    
    -  The suggested limitations (Section 2.3) in the processing of 
       routing headers limits also exposure to Denial-of-Service 
       attacks through cellular hosts. 
     
    -  IPv6 addressing privacy [RFC3041] may be used in cellular 
       hosts. However, it should be noted that in the 3GPP model, the 
       network would assign new addresses, in most cases, to hosts in 
       roaming situations and typically, also when the cellular hosts 
       activate a PDP context. This means that 3GPP networks will 
       already provide a limited form of addressing privacy, and no 
       global tracking of a single host is possible through its

Internet Draft      IPv6 for 2G and 3G Cellular Hosts    April 10, 2002 
 
 
       address. On the other hand, since a GGSN's coverage area is 
       expected to be very large when compared to currently deployed 
       default routers (no handovers between GGSNs are possible), a 
       cellular host can keep an address for a long time. Hence, IPv6 
       addressing privacy can be used for additional privacy during 
       the time the host is on and in the same area. The privacy 
       features can also be used to e.g. make different transport 
       sessions appear to come from different IP addresses. However, 
       it is not clear that these additional efforts confuse potential 
       observers any further, as they could monitor only the network 
       prefix part. 
     
    -  The use of various security services such as IPsec or TLS in 
       the connection of typical applications in cellular hosts is 
       discussed in Chapter 3 and recommendations are given there. 
     
    -  Chapter 3 also discusses under what conditions it is possible 
       to provide IPsec protection of e.g. ICMPv6 communications 
     
    -  The airtime used by cellular hosts is expensive. In some cases, 
       users are billed according to the amount of data they transfer 
       to and from their host. It is crucial for both the network and 
       the users that the airtime is used correctly and no extra 
       charges are applied to users due to misbehaving third parties. 
       The cellular links also have a limited capacity, which means 
       that they may not necessarily be able to accommodate more 
       traffic than what the user selected, such as a multimedia call. 
       Additional traffic might interfere with the service level 
       experienced by the user. While QoS mechanisms mitigate these 
       problems to an extent, it is still apparent that Denial-of-
       Service aspects may be highlighted in the cellular environment. 
       It is possible for existing DoS attacks that use for instance 
       packet amplification to be substantially more damaging in this 
       environment. How these attacks can be protected against is 
       still an area of further study. It is also often easy to fill 
       the cellular link and queues on both sides with additional or 
       large packets. 
     
    -  In certain areas of the world, it is possible to buy a prepaid 
       cellular subscription without presenting personal 
       identification. This could be leveraged by attackers that wish 
       to remain unidentified. We note that while the user hasn't been 
       identified, the equipment still is; the operators can follow 
       the identity of the device and block it from further use. The 
       operators must have procedures in place to take notice of third 
       party complaints regarding the use of their customers' devices. 
       It may also be necessary for the operators to have attack 
       detection tools that enable them to efficiently detect attacks 
       launched from the cellular hosts.

    -  Cellular devices that have local network interfaces (such as 
       IrDA or Bluetooth) may be used to launch attacks through them, 
       unless the local interfaces are secured in an appropriate 
       manner. Therefore, we recommend that any local network 
       interface should have access controls to prevent by passers 
       from using the cellular host as an intermediary.

Appendix B Cellular Host IPv6 Addressing in the 3GPP Model  
    
   The appendix aims to very briefly describe the 3GPP IPv6 addressing 
   model for 2G (GPRS) and 3G (UMTS) cellular networks from Release 99 
   onwards. More information can be found from 3GPP Technical 
   Specification 23.060.

Internet Draft      IPv6 for 2G and 3G Cellular Hosts    April 10, 2002 
 
 
   There are two possibilities to allocate the address for an IPv6 node 
   û stateless and stateful autoconfiguration. The stateful address 
   allocation mechanism needs a DHCP server to allocate the address for 
   the IPv6 node.  On the other hand, the stateless autoconfiguration 
   procedure does not need any external entity involved in the address 
   autoconfiguration (apart from the GGSN). 
    
   In order to support the standard IPv6 stateless address 
   autoconfiguration mechanism, as defined by the IETF, the GGSN shall 
   assign a prefix that is unique within its scope to each primary PDP 
   context that uses IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration. This 
   avoids the necessity to perform Duplicate Address Detection at the 
   network level for every address built by the mobile host. The GGSN 
   always provides an Interface Identifier to the mobile host. The 
   Mobile host uses the interface identifier provided by the GGSN to 
   generate its link-local address. Since the GGSN provides the 
   cellular host with the interface identifier, it must ensure the 
   uniqueness of such identifier on the link (I.e. no collisions 
   between its own link local address and the cellular host's).  
   In addition, the GGSN will not use any of the prefixes assigned to 
   cellular hosts to generate any of its own addresses.  
   This use of the interface identifier, combined with the fact that 
   each PDP context is allocated a unique prefix, will eliminate the 
   need for DAD messages over the air interface, and consequently 
   allows an efficient use of bandwidth. Furthermore, the allocation of 
   a prefix to each PDP context will allow hosts to implement the 
   privacy extensions in RFC 3041 without the need for further DAD 
   messages.  
    
Appendix C Transition Issues 
      
   IETF has specified a number of IPv4 / IPv6 transition mechanisms 
   [RFC-2893] to ensure smooth transition from IPv4 to IPv6 and 
   interoperability between IPv4 and IPv6 during the transition period. 
   The three main transition methods from a cellular network point of 
   view are dual IPv4 / IPv6 stacks, tunneling and protocol 
   translators, such as NAT-PT or SIIT. 
    
   It is recommended that cellular hosts have dual IPv4 / IPv6 stacks 
   to be able to interoperate with both IPv4 and IPv6 domains and use 
   both IPv6 and IPv4 applications / services. It is recommended that 
   most transition mechanisms be provided by the network in order to 
   save the limited resources of the cellular host.  Tunneling (for 
   example RFC 3056 - Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds) 
   should be carried out in the network.  In addition, any protocol 
   translation function, such as NAT-PT, should be implemented in the 
   network, not in the cellular host.  
    
   The tunneling mechanism specified by [RFC-2529] is not relevant for 
   a cellular host. [RFC-2529] allows isolated IPv6-only hosts to 
   connect to an IPv6 router via an IPv4 domain. The scenario of an

   IPv6-only host in an IPv4-only cellular network is considered 
   unlikely. 
    
Appendix D Mobility Issues 
 
   This appendix discusses the level of support of MIPv6 required by 
   cellular hosts and highlight the scenarios in which such support is 
   needed. Mobile IPv6 is specified in [MIPv6].  
    
   Mobile IP is required for hosts moving within the Internet topology. 
   At the highest level, the Mobile IPv6 functionality within Mobile 
   Nodes can be divided to the following parts: 
    
     - Correspondent Node (CN) functionality, defined by Mobile IPv6 
       specification [MIPv6], i.e. the basic functionality needed to 
       correspond with mobile nodes. 
     - Mobile Node (MN) functionality [MIPv6]. This includes the 
       ability to configure Home and Care-of-Addresses (CoA) send 
       Binding Updates (BUs) and receive Binding Acknowledgements and 
       Requests. In addition, this function also includes the ability 
       to maintain a Binding Update List. 
     - Route optimization. The functionality needed to correspond with 
       mobile nodes in an optimal manner. 
    
   We will discuss the use of each part in turn. 
    
   The basic functionality of a Correspondent Node, i.e. process the 
   Home Address Option, must be supported by all hosts. However, at the 
   time this is being written, the Home Address Option is defined only 
   in preliminary form in [MIPv6]. Furthermore, at present it is 
   unclear whether this option can be understood by all nodes or only 
   in conjunction with Route Optimization. This is due to the possible 
   use of the option in Denial-of-Service attacks that employ CNs as 
   reflectors. Cellular host implementers are advised that leaving out 
   Home Address Option support may prevent their hosts to communicate 
   with future MIPv6 MNs. On the other hand, the inclusion of Home 
   Address Option without Route Optimization being active for that host 
   may present a threat that allows the cellular hosts to be used as 
   reflectors in Denial-of-Service attacks. 
    
   The mobile node functionality is needed when the host itself will 
   move within the Internet topology i.e. changes its care-of address. 
   This function is needed in cellular systems where MIPv6 is used for 
   intra-access technology mobility. In other cellular systems where 
   intra-access technology mobility is handled by other means (e.g. GTP 
   in a 3GPP system), hosts with additional, non-cellular interfaces 
   must have this functionality if they need to retain session or IP 
   layer reachability while moving between different access 
   technologies, i.e. - to use MIPv6 for inter-system IP handovers. 
   For instance, when a hosts has both a Wireless LAN (WLAN) and an 
   UMTS interface, MIPv6 MN functionality is needed to retain sessions

Internet Draft      IPv6 for 2G and 3G Cellular Hosts    April 10, 2002 
 
 
   when moving from UMTS area to a WLAN area. The UMTS network provides 
   a basic mobility service (layer 2 mobility) to all hosts without 
   requiring the implementation of IP layer mobility. Hosts that have 
   interfaces only to networks providing such other mobility services, 
   or hosts that do not require session mobility through interface 
   handovers may have this functionality for reachability when the DNS 
   is used to locate a host. That is, when roaming between different 
   cellular operators. A host, in this case, would require a home 
   address in the DNS and a Home agent. When connected to a default 
   router for the host, the host would update its Home Agent with its 
   new address.  
    
   Mobile node functionality is fully defined in the Mobile IPv6 
   specifications and should only be implemented according to an 
   official standard. 
 
   The Route Optimization functionality for a CN, i.e. processing of 
   Binding Updates, should be supported by all hosts supporting the 
   Mobile Node functions and may be supported by all hosts. 
    
   Route Optimization functionality should also only be implemented 
   according to an official standard. 
    
   Hosts that implement MIPv6 must support the security features 
   defined in [MIPv6]. Note that MNs, CNs, and Route Optimization 
   functionality may have different requirements.
