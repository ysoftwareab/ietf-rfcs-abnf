Abstract 

   The previously proposed Hybrid Overlay Multicast Framework uses a 
   structured peer-to-peer overlay to connect peers in different types 
   of multicast regions of the Internet. We use AMT (Automatic IP

   Multicast Without Explicit Tunnels) to connect peers in ALM 
   (Application Layer Multicast) regions with peers in native multicast 
   regions. Here we define the overlay messaging needed to support the 
   multicast tree operations. One goal of this approach is to ensure 
   that the SAM framework is compatible with the P2P-SIP overlay, which 
   is still being defined. Another goal is to be overlay agnostic so 
   that different overlay algorithms can interoperate in a single SAM 
   (Scalable Adaptive Multicast) session.

Internet-Draft           SAM Overlay Protocol         February 26, 2008 
    

1. Introduction 

   In this document we define messages for hybrid overlay multicast tree 
   creation, using an existing proposal (P2PP) in the P2P-SIP WG 
   [BAS2007] for a universal structured peer-to-peer overlay protocol. 
   The purpose of this approach is to ensure that the hybrid overlay 
   multicast framework [BUF2008] (hereafter SAM framework) can be 
   implemented on P2P-SIP overlays, and that the SAM framework is 
   overlay agnostic. Since P2PP is intended to cover at least a variety 
   of structured multi-hop algorithms, it is suitable for achieving an 
   overlay agnostic approach.  
   We are not proposing that these SAM-specific messages be incorporated 
   into [BAS2007] since constructing the SAM framework is still a 
   research activity. However, we do propose that P2PP add an extension 
   mechanism, defined here as the "Experimental" message type. This 
   document also defines a SAM extension to P2PP using this Experimental 
   message type. 
   As discussed in the SAM requirements draft, there are a variety of 
   ALM tree formation and tree maintenance algorithms. The intent of 
   this specification is to be algorithm agnostic, similar to how P2PP 
   is overlay algorithm agnostic.  We assume that all control messages 
   are propagated using overlay routed messages. 
   The message types needed for ALM behavior are divided into the 
   following categories: 
   o  Tree life-cycle (create, join, leave, re-form, heartbeat) 

   o  AMT [THA2007] gateway advertisement and discovery 

   o  Peer region and multicast properties 

   For encoding we propose a single SAM message type be added to P2PP. 
   Implementations of P2PP compliant with this specification MUST 
   support this new message type and all subtypes defined here. 
    

2. Tree Lifecylce Messages 

   Peers use the overlay to transmit ALM (application layer multicast) 
   operations and hybrid ALM operations defined in this section. 

2.1. Create Tree 

   A new ALM tree is created in the overlay with the identity specified 
   by GroupId. The usual interpretation of GroupId is that the peer with

Internet-Draft           SAM Overlay Protocol         February 26, 2008 
    

   peer id closest to and less than the GroupId is the root of the tree. 
   The tree has no children at the time it is created. 
   The GroupId is generated from a well-known session key to be used by 
   other Peers to address the multicast tree in the overlay. The 
   generation of the GroupId from the SessionKey MUST be done using the 
   overlay's id generation mechanism. 
   Create(PeerId, SessionKey, GroupId, Options) 
   PeerId: the overlay address of the peer that creates the multicast 
   tree. 
   SessionKey: a well-known string when hashed using the overlay's id 
   generation algorithm produces the GroupId. 
   GroupId: the overlay address of the root of the tree 
   Options: name-value list of properties to be associated with the 
   tree, such as the maximum size of the tree, restrictions on peers 
   joining the tree, latency constraints, preference for distributed or 
   centralized tree formation and maintenance, heartbeat interval. 
2.2. Join 

   Causes the distributed algorithm for peer join of a specific ALM 
   group to be invoked. If successful, the PeerId is notified of one or 
   more candidate parent peers in one or more JoinAccept messages. The 
   particular ALM join algorithm is not specified in this protocol. 
   Join(PeerId, GroupId, Options) 
   PeerId: overlay address of joining/leaving peer 
   GroupId: the overlay address of the root of the tree 
   Options: name-value list of options proposed by joining peer 
2.3. Join Accept 

   Tells the requesting joining peer that the indicated peer is 
   available to act as its parent in the ALM tree specified by GroupId, 
   with the corresponding Options specified. A peer MAY receive more 
   than one JoinAccept from diffent candidate parent peers in the 
   GroupId tree.  The peer accepts a peer as parent using a JoinConfirm 
   message. A JoinAccept which receives neither a JoinConfirm or 
   JoinDecline response MUST expire. 
   JoinAccept(ParentPeerId, ChildPeerId, GroupId, Options) 
   ParentPeerId: overlay address of a peer which accepts the joining 
   peer 
   ChildPeerId: overlay address of joining peer

Internet-Draft           SAM Overlay Protocol         February 26, 2008 
    

   GroupId: the overlay address of the root of the tree 
   Options: name-value list of options accepted by parent peer 
2.4. Join Confirm 

   A peer receiving a JoinAccept message which it wishes to accept MUST 
   explicitly accept it before the expiration of the JoinAccept using a 
   JoinConfirm message. The joining peer MUST include only those options 
   from the JoinAccept which it also accepts, completing the negotiation 
   of options between the two peers. 

   JoinConfirm(ChildPeerId, ParentPeerId, GroupId, Options) 

   ChildPeerId: overlay address of joining peer which is a child of the 
   parent peer 
   ParentPeerId: overlay address of the peer which is the parent of the  
   joining peer 
   GroupId: the overlay address of the root of the tree 
   Options: name-value list of options accepted by both peers 

2.5. Join Decline 

   A peer receiving a JoinAccept message which does not wish to accept 
   it MAY explicitly decline it using a JoinDecline message. 

   JoinDecline(PeerId, ParentPeerId, GroupId) 

   PeerId: overlay address of joining peer which declines the JoinAccept 
   ParentPeerId: overlay address of the peer which issued a JoinAccept 
   to this peer 
   GroupId: the overlay address of the root of the tree 
2.6. Join Via AMT Gateway 

   A request to create a hybrid native multicast connection for the 
   specified PeerId peer to join the tree identified by the GroupId. The 
   request is transmitted to one or more parent peer candidates and/or 
   rendezvous peers for the specified group id, according to the usual 
   join protocol in this overlay.  
   If the parent peer is a P-AMT-GW (a peer which supports the AMT-GW 
   interface), then after JoinAccept and JoinConfirm steps, instead of 
   an overlay parent-child link, an AMT tunnel is formed using the AMT 
   protocol from the P-AMT-GW to the specified AMT-GW to which the Peer 
   is associated.

Internet-Draft           SAM Overlay Protocol         February 26, 2008 
    

   If parent peer is a peer P-NM in native multicast region, then after 
   JoinAccept and JoinConfirm steps, the tunnel is created between P-
   NM's AMT-GW and the specified AMT-GW, using the AMT protocol.  
   If parent peer is a P-ALM, then the requested is propagated to other 
   peers in the tree according to the join processing rules.  
   JoinViaAMTGateway(PeerId, AMT-GW, GroupId, Options)  
   PeerID: the peer requesting to join the ALM group identified by 
   group_id 
   AMT-GW: ip address of the AMT gateway that the peer uses in its 
   native multicast region.  
   Options: name-value list of options proposed by joining peer 
2.7. Leave 

   A peer which is part of an ALM tree idenfied by GroupId which intends 
   to detach from either a child or parent peer SHOULD send a Leave 
   message to the peer it wishes to detach from. A peer receiving a 
   Leave message from a peer which is neither in its parent or child 
   lists SHOULD ignore the message.  
   Leave(PeerId, GroupId, Options) 
   PeerId: overlay address of leaving peer 
   GroupId: the overlay address of the root of the tree 
   Options: name-value list of options 

2.8. Leave Via AMT Gateway 

   A peer which is part of an ALM tree identified by GroupId which 
   intends to detach from either a child or parent peer and which uses 
   an AMT tunnel to connect to the peer SHOULD send a LeaveViaAMTGateway 
   message to the peer it wishes to detach from. A peer receiving a 
   LeaveViaAMTGateway message from a peer which is neither in its parent 
   or child lists SHOULD ignore the message.  
   The request is transmitted the AdjacentPeerId. AdjacentPeerId MUST 
   remove the specified PeerId from its children or parent lists if 
   present. 
   If AdjacentPeerId is a P-AMT-GW, then it MAY tear down the AMT tunnel 
   from P-AMT-GW to the specified AMT-GW if no other children are using 
   it. If AdjacentPeerId is a peer P-NM (peer in a native multicast 
   region), then the tunnel between P-NM's AMT-GW and the specified AMT-
   GW MAY be removed according to the policy and configuration of the 
   AMT-GW.

   LeaveViaAMTGateway(PeerId, AdjacentPeerId, AMT-GW, GroupId, Options) 
   PeerId: overlay address of leaving peer 
   AdjacentPeerId: overlay address of an adjacent (parent or child) peer  
   AMT-GW: ip address of the AMT gateway that the peer uses in its 
   native multicast region.  
   GroupId: the overlay address of the root of the tree 
   Options: name-value list of options 
2.9. Re-Form or Optimize Tree 

   This triggers a reorganization of either the entire tree or only a 
   sub-tree. It MAY include hints to specific peers of recommended 
   parent or child peers to reconnect to. A peer receiving this message 
   MAY ignore it, MAY propagate it to other peers in its subtree, and 
   MAY invoke local algorithms for selecting preferred parent and/or 
   child peers. 
   Reform(GroupId, { PeerId }, Options) 
   GroupId: the overlay address of the root of the tree 
   PeerId: if omitted, then the tree is reorganized starting from the 
   root, otherwise it is reorganized only at the sub-tree identified by 
   PeerId. 
   Options: name-value list of options 
2.10. Heartbeat 

   A node signals to its adjacent nodes in the tree that it is alive. If 
   a peer does not receive a Heartbeat message within N heartbeat time 
   intervals, it MUST treat this as an explicit Leave message from the 
   unresponsive peer. N is configurable.  
   Heartbeat(PeerId1, PeerId2, GroupId) 
   PeerId1: source of heartbeat 
   PeerId2: destination of heartbeat 
   GroupId: overlay address of the root of the tree 
3. AMT Gateway Advertisement and Discovery 

   Allows peer to disclose to other peers in the overlay their ability 
   to act as a native-multicast gateway (as in AMT) for peers in a given 
   region.  We expect to use the P2P Publish and Lookup messages for 
   this purpose. But to avoid collision with the semantics of those 
   operations, we temporarily define shadow versions within the SAM

   extension.  Publish stores an advertisement object for a peer with is 
   an AMT gateway in the DHT for the overlay, under a given key. 
   PublishAMTGateway(PeerId, Key, Region, Options) 
   LookupAMTGateway(PeerId, Key) 
   PeerId: the peer which is the AMT gateway 
   Key: the key by which other peers lookup the advertisement, details 
   TBD. There can be more than one key. 
   Region: an id for a region, using some region identification scheme 
   TBD 
   Options: Name-value list of options 
4. Peer Region and Multicast Properties Messages 

   Peers can advertise the network region that they belong to and its 
   native multicast properties if any. Similar to AMT Gateway 
   advertisement and discovery, uses the DHT for lookup and publish. 
   PublishPeerNMInfo(PeerId, Key, Options) 
   LookupPeerNMInfo(PeerId, Key) 
   PeerId: the peer which is the AMT gateway 
   Key: the key by which other peers lookup the advertisement, details 
   TBD. There can be more than one key. 
   Options: Name-value list of options 
5. Message Format 

5.1. P2PP Extension 

   We propose a new message be added to the 18 existing message types: 
   P2PP-Msg = ... | Experimental 
5.2. Experimental Message 

   Experimental = Common-header 
               Peer-Info 
               Certificate-Sign-Request 
               Password 
               Extension-Name 
               Extension-Body 
   Extension-Name = SAM | ...

Internet-Draft           SAM Overlay Protocol         February 26, 2008 
    

   Extension-Body = extension-specific 
6. SAM Extension-Body 

   The extension-body used by the SAM extension to P2PP is as follows. 

   Extension-Body = Extension-Message-Type | Arguments | Options 

   Extension-Message-Type =  

     CreateTree | Join | JoinAccept | JoinConfirm | JoinDecline | 
     JoinViaAMTGateway | Leave | LeaveViaAMTGateway | Heartbeat | 
     PublishAMTGateway | LookupAMTGateway | PublishPeerNMInfo | 
     LookupPeerNMInfo | Reform 

   Arguments = PID | GroupId | Key | SessionKey | AMT-GW  

   PID = PeerId | AdjacentPeerId | ChildPeerId | ParentPeerId  

   Options = {Option}* 

   Option = Name, Value  

7. Message Encoding 

   P2PP uses a binary encoding. The encoding for the SAM extension 
   messages will be defined in a subsequent draft.

8. Security Considerations 

   Overlays are vulnerable to DOS and collusion attacks.  We are not 
   solving overlay security issues. 
   For this version we assume centralized peer authentication model 
   similar to what is proposed for P2P-SIP.
