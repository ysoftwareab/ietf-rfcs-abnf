               Secure Session Layer Services KMP via HIP
                      draft-moskowitz-ssls-iot-00

Abstract

   This memo addresses the need for secure, end-to-end communications
   from IoT devices to collectors, where the IoT devices many be too
   resource constrained for typical IETF solutions or may be deployed
   over non-IP networks (e.g.  CAN FD, IEEE 802.15.6, serial SCADA).
   For such deployments, the Secure Session Layer Service [draft-hares-
   ssls-00] the needed, and sufficient features to ensure successful and
   safe communications.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF has a plethora of security solutions targeted at IoT.  Yet
   all too many IoT products are deployed with no or improperly
   configured security.  In particular resource constrained IoT devices
   and non-IP IoT networks have not been well served in the IETF.

   This effort focuses on a minimal-to-have set of security features and
   related communications functions for these special, yet rather common
   collection of IoT devices.  This effort need not be restricted to
   these special cases; it will work for any IoT device on any network.
   The goal is that all are serviced and protected.

   A IoT device can be resource constrained by its CPU, memory, and/or
   power.  Any one of these could result in non-applicablity of common
   secure communications tools.  All three together occurs in many
   devices.  The IoT network can be constrained by bandwidth, MTU, and/
   or high packet loss.  An additional set of constraints can be legal;
   in terms of mandated end-to-end privacy (e.g.  HIPPA).

   All this points to a need for a constrained solution for constrained
   environments.

2.  Terms and Definitions

2.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Notations

   This section will contain notations

2.3.  Definitions

   TBD

3.  Minimal feature set

   Minimal still implies something done.  In this case that something
   is:

   Secure communications envelope:  The data on the 'wire' must at least
      have a cryptographic integrity check and optionally content
      privacy.

   Security key management:  The keying material for securing the
      communications envelope must be fresh and unique.

   Unique device Identity:  The device must have an Identity that
      uniquely identifies it in a trusted manner.

   Minimal means the least amount of tools and one for each function,
   with perhaps one for many functions.  Much of this is standard, but
   later will be shown how to minimize its size and performance impact.

   ECC for Identity:  An Eliptic Curve public key can be the base of the
      Identity.

   ECC key management:  ECC can be 'reused' for the key management
      protocol.

   Symmetric cryptography for message protection:  Four functions are
      needed: privacy, integrity, hashing, randomness.

   Message management:  Three functions are needed: data chunking,
      message fragmentation/reassembly, and receipt acknowledgment.
      Data compression is an optional fourth function.

   ECC has been perceived as still too much.  It does set a barrier of
   an 8-bit CPU, time and memory.  ECDH based on ECC25519 [RFC7748] has
   been implemented on 8-bit CPUs, running 9 seconds.

   HIP DEX [I-D.ietf-hip-dex] is a minimalist KMP and defined for
   application use in [I-D.moskowitz-ssls-hip].

   The Secure Session Layer Services (SSLS) [draft-hares-ssls-00]
   provides a well defined session layer that can be implemented in any
   application to provide any or all of the following:

   o  data compression

   o  chunking of data

   o  secure envelope

   o  fragmentation and reassembly

4.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.  May be nothing for IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

6.  Acknowledgments
