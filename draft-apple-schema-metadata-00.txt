INTERNET DRAFT    Directory Schema Listing Metadata         June 2003 
 
 
    
1. Introduction 
    
    
   The fastest route to interoperable directory services is through 
   standard object classes and attribute types. There is a growing 
   number of places where schema for Internet Directory Services and 
   Internet Operations are being defined, with varying degrees of 
   documentation.  This plethora of schema is unavoidable in the light 
   of the needs of different service communities, but it makes it 
   difficult for directory service builders to find and make use of an 
   existing schema that will serve their needs and increase 
   interoperability with other systems. A listing service providing a 
   single point of discovery for directory service schema will promote 
   schema reuse, reduce duplication of effort, and thus promote 
   directory service interoperability. Metadata will be used to catalog 
   and distinguish schema listings in this service. This document 
   defines a MIME directory [RFC2927] profile for metadata content 
   transfer and encoding. 
    
    
1.1 Terms and Definitions 
    
    
   Information Object - a descriptive abstraction of some real-world 
   object 
    
   Object Attribute - a descriptive property of an information object; 
   typically, object attributes are defined in terms of semantic and 
   syntactic definitions 
    
   Schema - a collection of definitions for related information objects 
    
   Schema Unit - a related or grouped set of object attributes that form 
   a discrete unit within the context of a schema for a particular 
   protocol; examples include an LDAP object class or a WHOIS++ template 
    
   Schema Pak - a related or grouped set of schema units that 
   collectively specify a schema associated with a particular protocol; 
   an example of a schema pak is the set of LDAP object classes 
   specified in [RFC2256] 
    
   Metadata - characteristics that differentiate one schema unit or 
   schema pak from another; used to catalog listing service content; 
   structured using a profile of [RFC2927]; also contains references to 
   files stored within and outside of a listing repository 
    
   Schema Unit Content - a formal specification of a schema unit using a 
   profile of [RFC2927]

INTERNET DRAFT    Directory Schema Listing Metadata         June 2003 
 
 
    
   Schema Unit Listing - the combination of a single schema unit content 
   file intended for use within the context of a particular protocol an 
   a file containing metadata describing the schema unit specified 
   within that schema unit content file 
    
   Schema Pak Listing - a single metadata file containing information 
   describing and referring to a set of related or grouped schema unit 
   content files 
    
   Repository - a database in which listings are stored 
    
   Listing Request - a proposed schema unit listing or schema pak 
   listing formatted using [MIME] constructs that is submitted for 
   consideration as a listing to be published in a repository 
    
   Operator - an organization that administers and maintains a 
   repository 
    
   Primary Repository - the repository that masters the schema listings 
   database 
    
   Shadow Repository - a repository that mirrors the primary repository 
    
   Contact Person - the name of the individual who holds the authority 
   to update a listing and who should be contacted if questions or 
   concerns arise related to a listing or listing request 
    
   Listing Authority Contact - the name of the individual who holds 
   authority to replace a contact person; can be either the contact 
   person for a listing or an alternate contact within the organization 
   to which the contact person belongs (this allows one person 
   organizations to list schema) 
    
   The terms for specifying requirement level defined in [RFC2119] are 
   used in this document. 
    
    
2. The "schema-metadata-0" MIME Directory Profile Registration 
    
    
   This profile is identified by the following registration template 
   information. 
    
   To: ietf-mime-direct@imc.org 
    
   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME profile "schema-
   metadata-0"

INTERNET DRAFT    Directory Schema Listing Metadata         June 2003 
 
 
   Profile Name: schema-metadata-0 
    
   Profile Purpose: To represent metadata for a schema listing stored in 
   the repository or a schema listing request under community review. 
    
   Profile Types: listingName, listingTitle, listingUse, specFile, 
   relatedTo, contactLanguage, contactName, contactEmail, contactPhone, 
   contactAddress, authLanguage, authName, authEmail, authPhone, 
   authAddress, specURL, security, created, moreInfo, caveat, 
   listingComments, schemaPak, pakMember 
    
   Profile Special Notes: 
    
   The charset parameter MUST be present in the MIME content header and 
   the value of this parameter MUST be "utf-8". 
    
   Neither the "BEGIN", "END", nor "SOURCE" type is used in the contents 
   of this profile. 
    
   Type grouping is not used in the contents of this profile. 
    
   Each MIME Directory Type Registration that follows in section 3 of 
   this document includes a specification of whether or not a particular 
   type is constrained to be single-valued or permitted to be multi-
   valued. Types that are permitted to be multi-valued MUST have at 
   least one value, unless otherwise noted in the 'Type special notes' 
   component of a type definition. 
    
   Implementors should note that there will likely be values of profile 
   types in some contents much longer than 76 bytes. In addition, there 
   may be non-ASCII characters and embedded CRLFs inside of values, 
   which could require either quoting of the value or use of a content 
   transfer encoding. 
    
   The following types MUST be included by schema writers in schema unit 
   listing requests: listingName, listingTitle, listingUse, specFile, 
   contactLanguage, contactName, contactEmail, contactPhone, 
   contactAddress, authLanguage, authName, authEmail, authPhone, 
   authAddress, and security. 
    
   The following types MUST be included by schema writers in schema pak 
   listing requests: listingName, listingTitle, listingUse, specFile, 
   contactLanguage, contactName, contactEmail, contactPhone, 
   contactAddress, authLanguage, authName, authEmail, authPhone, 
   authAddress, and security. 
    
   The 'listingName' type value MUST be created by the primary listing 
   repository operator.

INTERNET DRAFT    Directory Schema Listing Metadata         June 2003 
 
 
   The 'relatedTo' type value MUST be provided by the schema writer as a 
   part of a listing request if the listing proposed in the request has 
   a relationship to published listings and/or other listing requests 
   being reviewed. 
    
   Values for the following types MUST be provided by the primary schema 
   listing repository operator and MUST NOT be accepted from the schema 
   writer:  specURL, created, listingComments, and pakMember. 
    
   The schemaPak type value MAY be provided by either the primary schema 
   listing repository operator or the schema writer when required. 
    
   The moreInfo type value is OPTIONAL, but MUST be provided by the 
   schema writer. if this metadata element is to be included in a 
   published listing. 
    
   Intended Usage: COMMON 
    
    
3. MIME Directory Type Registrations 
    
    
   This document defines all types use in the schema-metadata-0 profile. 
   These types are intended for use in the "schema-metadata-0" profile, 
   although they may be applicable to other profiles defined in the 
   future. 
    
    
3.1 listingName 
 
 
   To: ietf-mime-direct@imc.org 
    
   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME type listingName 
    
   Type name: listingName 
    
   Type purpose: To represent a globally unique identifier for the 
   listing name. 
    
   Type encoding: 8bit 
    
   Type valuetype: text, with the following syntax (specified using the 
   ABNF in [RFC2234]): 
    
    name = base-component "." sequence "." version 
    
    base-component = "base" / oid

    oid = oid-component *("." oid-component) 
    
    oid-component = 1*DIGIT 
    
    DIGIT = <any ASCII decimal digit (0x30 - 0x39)> 
    
    sequence = NZDIGIT *DIGIT 
    
    NZDIGIT = <any DIGIT except "0" (0x30)> 
    
    version = sequence 
    
   Type special notes: 
    
    
    This type MUST be single-valued. 
    
    A language parameter MUST NOT be used with this type. 
    
    For published listings, a value of this type is an OID constructed 
    by the primary listing repository operator based on a root OID 
    administered by that operator, a listing sequence number generated 
    by that operator, a listing version number assigned by that 
    operator, and a file type indicator. 
    
    For listing requests, a place holder for the root OID is used in 
    place of the actual base OID administered by the primary listing 
    repository operator. This place holder is simply the text string 
    "base" as indicated in the <base-component> rule above. 
    
    
3.2 listingTitle 
    
    
   To: ietf-mime-direct@imc.org

   Type name: listingTitle 
    
   Type purpose: To represent a real world title of a listed schema unit 
   or schema pak. 
    
   Type encoding: 8bit 
    
   Type valuetype: text, with the following syntax (specified using the 
   ABNF in [RFC2234]):

5. Security Considerations 
    
    
   The text/directory profile defined in this document does not provide 
   any method for carrying authentication information. 
    
   The text/directory profile defined in this document allows content 
   external to any schema listing service repository to be referenced in 
   a listing and includes an MD5-based fingerprint of the referenced 
   content itself. Users of the schema listing service SHOULD take steps 
   to verify that this external information has not changed since

   listing publication. Users should also be aware that such external 
   content is outside of the control of the schema listing service 
   operators. 
    
   A MIME body part containing contents structured according to the 
   text/directory profile defined in this document MAY be incorporated 
   in a digitally signed MIME content, which can be used to verify that 
   the body part has not been modified during transit. If a signer has 
   been certified by a trusted third party, it may also be possible to 
   verify the origin of the content.
