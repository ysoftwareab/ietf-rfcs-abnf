dkim=  Outbound signing practices for the domain (plain-text;
      REQUIRED).  Possible values are as follows:

      unknown  The domain might sign some or all email.

      all  All mail from the domain is signed with an Author Signature.

      discardable  All mail from the domain is signed with an Author
         Signature.  Furthermore, if a message arrives without a valid
         Author Signature due to modification in transit, submission via
         a path without access to a signing key, or other reason, the
         domain encourages the recipient(s) to discard it.

      ABNF:

asp-dkim-tag = %x64.6b.69.6d *WSP "="
               *WSP ("unknown" / "all" / "discardable")

t= Flags, represented as a colon-separated list of names (plain-text;
      OPTIONAL, default is that no flags are set).  Flag values are:

      s  The signing practices apply only to the named domain, and not
         to subdomains.

      ABNF:

asp-t-tag    = %x74 *WSP "=" *WSP { asp-t-tag-flag
               0*( *WSP ":" *WSP asp-t-tag-flag )
asp-t-tag-flag = "s" / hyphenated-word
               ; for future extension
hyphenated-word =  ALPHA [ *(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
               (ALPHA / DIGIT) ]
