Abstract

   Service scheme templates for several different "white" and "yellow"
   pages services are presented.

1. Introduction

   In "Advertising Services" [1], several different types of "service:"
   URL schemes are proposed. As specified by [2], the service scheme
   templates for several of those services are documented here.  For all
   the schemes herein, stripping the "service:" and the leading "wp-" or
   "yp-" from the service URL results in the URL for the resource..


2. Specifying White Pages Services

   To locate people on the Internet, a client connects to a "White
   Pages" service.  A variety of protocols are available for connecting

INTERNET DRAFT       White and Yellow Page Services        February 1997


   to such services.  As [2] recommends that service templates be as
   protocol-specific as possible, there are multiple templates for white
   pages services, specified in this section.


2.1. WP-LDAP Service

   When LDAP [3] is the protocol for accessing a "White Pages" service,
   the "wp-ldap" template is used.  Here, the syntax of the URLpath is
   specified in [4].

      "Service Discover Multicast Address = NONE

       Service type = wp-ldap

       Version      = 0.0

       Language tag = en

       Description  =
         The wp-ldap (or White Pages via LDAP) service type provides
         attributes for looking up people via the LDAP protocol.

       Authorization policy = :: NONE ::
         A text description of any authentication requirements for use of
         this server.

       Use policy = :: NONE ::
         A text description of any intended Use policy for this server.

       Access protocol = :: LDAP ::
         This white pages server's access protocol, which is used to
         distinguish from other white pages servers."


2.2. WP-WHOIS++ Service

   The "wp-ldap" template is used when WHOIS++ [5] is the access
   protocol for a White Pages service.  Here, the syntax of the URL path
   is specified in [6].

      "Sevice Discover Multicast Address = NONE

       Service type = wp-whois++

       Version      = 0.0

       Language tag = en

INTERNET DRAFT       White and Yellow Page Services        February 1997


       Description  =
         The wp-whois++ (or White Pages via WHOIS++) service type provides
         attributes for looking up people via the WHOIS++ protocol.

       Authorization policy = :: NONE ::
         A text description of any authentication requirements for use of
         this server.

       Use policy = :: NONE ::
         A text description of any intended Use policy for this server.

       Access protocol = :: WHOIS++ ::
         This white pages server's access protocol, which is used to
         distinguish from other white pages servers."


2.3. WP-PH Service

   The "wp-ph" template is used when CCSO/Ph [7] is the access protocol
   for a White Pages service.  Here, the syntax for the URL path is
   undefined.


4.1 WP-PH Service Template

Sevice Discover Multicast Address = NONE

    "Service type = wp-ph

    Version      = 0.0

    Language tag = en

    Description  =
      The wp-ph (or White Pages via PH) service type provides attributes
      for defining services for looking up people via the PH protocol.

    Authorization policy = :: NONE ::
      A text description of any authentication requirements for use of
      this server.

    Use policy = :: NONE ::
      A text description of any intended Use policy for this server.

    Access protocol = :: CCSO/PH ::
      This white pages server's access protocol, which is used to
      distinguish from other white pages servers."

5. Specification of YP-Z3950R Service

   This section specifies the template for the service "yp-z3950r,"
   which is for providing a "Yellow Pages" service for locating
   documents using Z39.50 [8] as the access protocol.

   The syntax for the URL path is specified in [9].


5.1 YP-Z3950R Service Template

   "Sevice Discover Multicast Address = NONE

    Service type = yp-z3950r

    Version      = 0.0

    Language tag = en

    Description  =
      The yp-z3950r (or Yellow Pages by Z39.50) service type provides
      attributes for looking up documents via the Z39.50 protocol.

    Authorization policy = :: NONE ::
      A text description of any authentication requirements for use of
      this server.

    Use policy = :: NONE ::
      A text description of any intended Use policy for this server.

    Access protocol = :: Z39.50 ::
      The access protocol used by this server (to
      distinguish from other servers)."


6. Specification of YP-Z3950S Service

   This section specifies the template for the service "yp-z3950s,"
   which is for providing a "Yellow Pages" service for locating
   documents using Z39.50 [8] as the access protocol.

   The syntax for the URL path is specified in [9].


6.1 YP-Z3950S Service Template

   "Sevice Discover Multicast Address = NONE

    Service type = yp-z3950s

    Version      = 0.0

    Language tag = en

    Description  =
      The yp-z3950s (or Yellow Pages by Z39.50) service type provides
      attributes for looking up documents via the Z39.50 session.

    Authorization policy = :: NONE ::
      A text description of any authentication requirements for use of
      this server.

    Use policy = :: NONE ::
      A text description of any intended Use policy for this server

    access protocol = :: Z39.50 ::
      The access protocol used by this server (to
      distinguish from other servers)."

7. Security Considerations

   The templates presented here are subject to the same implications as
   other service templates specified according to [2] and [10].
