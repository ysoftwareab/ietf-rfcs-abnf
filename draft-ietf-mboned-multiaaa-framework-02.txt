Abstract 
   IP multicast-based services, such as TV broadcasting or 
   videoconferencing raise the issue of making sure that potential 
   customers are fully entitled to access the corresponding contents. 
   There is indeed a need for service and content providers to identify 
   (if not authenticate, especially within the context of enforcing 
   electronic payment schemes) and to invoice such customers in a 
   reliable and efficient manner. This memo describes the framework for 
   specifying the Authorization, Authentication and Accounting (AAA) 
   capabilities that could be activated within the context of the 
   deployment and the operation of IP multicast-based services.  This 
   framework addresses the requirements presented in draft-ietf-mboned-
   maccnt-req-04.txt, "Requirements for Accounting, Authentication and 
   Authorization in Well Managed IP Multicasting Services".  
                                      
 
1. Introduction 
    
1.1 Purpose and Background 
   IP multicasting is designed to serve cases of group communication 
   schemes of any kind, such as 1-to-n (case of TV broadcasting 
   services for example) or n-to-p (case of videoconferencing services, 
   for example).   
      In these environments, IP multicast provides a better resource 
   optimization than using a unicast transmission scheme, where data 
   need to be replicated as many times as there are receivers. 
   Activation of IP multicast capabilities in networks yields the 
   establishment and the maintenance of multicast distribution trees 
   that are receiver-initiated by nature: multicast-formatted data are 
   forwarded to receivers who explicitly request them.

   Internet Draft     AAA Framework for Multicasting     October 2006 
    
    
    
        IP multicast-based services, such as TV broadcasting or 
   videoconferencing raise the issue of making sure that potential 
   customers are fully entitled to access the corresponding contents. 
   There is indeed a need for service and content providers to identify 
   (if not authenticate, especially within the context of enforcing 
   electronic payment schemes) and to invoice such customers in a 
   reliable and efficient manner. This memo describes the framework for 
   specifying the Authorization, Authentication and Accounting (AAA) 
   capabilities that could be activated within the context of the 
   deployment and the operation of IP multicast-based services. 
        Specifically, this framework addresses the requirements 
   presented in draft-ietf-mboned-maccnt-req-04.txt, "Requirements for 
   Accounting, Authentication and Authorization in Well Managed IP 
   Multicasting Services" MACCNT-REQ-draft describes the requirements 
   in CDN services using IP multicast[1]. The requirements are derived 
   from: 
        - need for user tracking and billing capabilities 
        - need for network access control to satisfy the requirements 
   of the Network Service Provider (NSP) and/or content access control 
   to satisfy the requirements of the Content Provider (CP) 
        - methods for sharing information between the network service 
   provider and content provider to make it possible to fulfill the 
   above two requirements. 
    
   Detailed requirements are presented in MACCNT-REQ-draft.   These 
   requirements include mechanisms for recording end-user requests and 
   provider responses for content-delivery, sharing user information 
   (possibly anonymously depending on the trust model) between content 
   provider and network service provider, and protecting resources 
   through the prevention of network and content access by unauthorized 
   users, as well as other AAA related requirements. 
     
   The purpose of this memo is to provide a generalized framework for  
   specifying multicast-inferred AAA capabilities that can meet these 
   requirements. This framework is to provide a basis for future work 
   of investigating the applicability of existing AAA protocols to 
   provide these AAA capabilities in IP multicast specific context 
   and/or if deemed necessary, the refining or defining of protocols to 
   provide these capabilities.   
    
   This draft's scope is limited to discussing SSM, 1-to-n IP 
   multicasting exclusively.

   Internet Draft     AAA Framework for Multicasting     October 2006 
    
    
    
   Accounting: The set of capabilities that allow the retrieval of a 
   set of statistical data that can be defined on a per customer and/or 
   a per service basis, within the context of the deployment of 
   multicast-based services. Such data are retrieved for billing 
   purposes, and can be retrieved on a regular basis or upon 
   unsolicited requests. Such data include (but are not necessarily 
   limited to) the volume of multicast-formatted data that have been 
   forwarded to the receiver over a given period of time, the volume of 
   multicast-formatted data that have been exchanged between a receiver 
   (or set of) and a given source over a given period of time (e.g. the 
   duration of a multicast session), etc.  
    
   Authentication: action for identifying a user as a genuine one. 
 
   Authorization: The set of capabilities that need to be activated to 
   make sure a given requesting customer is (1) what he claims to be 
   (identification purposes), and (2) is fully entitled to access a set 
   of services (authentication purposes). 
    
   Receiver: an end-host or end-client which receives content.  A 
   receiver may be identified by a network ID such as MAC address or IP 
   address.   
    
   User: a human with a user account.  A user may possibly use multiple 
   reception devices.  Multiple users may use the same reception device. 
    
   Note: The definition of a receiver (device) and a user (human) 
   should not be confused.

3. Common use models and network architecture implications 
    
   In some cases a single entity may design and be responsible for a 
   system that covers the various common high-level requirements of a 
   multicasting system such as 1) content serving, 2) the 
   infrastructure to multicast it, 3) network and content access 
   control mechanisms.  In many cases however the content provision and 
   network provision roles are divided between separate entities.  The 
   MACCNT-REQ-draft provides more detail of the multiple versus single 
   entity CDS network model. 
 
   As such it should not be assumed that the entity responsible for the 
   multicasting structure and the entity responsible for content 
   serving are the same.  Indeed because the infrastructure for 
   multicasting is expensive and many content holders are not likely to 
   be competent at building and maintaining complicated infrastructures 
   necessary for multicasting, many content holders would prefer to 
   purchase transport and management services from a network service 
   provider and thus share the infrastructure costs with other content 
   holders.   
    
   Similarly network service providers in many cases do not specialize 
   in providing content and are unlikely to build and maintain such a 
   resource-intensive system without a certain level of demand from 
   content holders.   
    
   The use model of a single NSP providing multicasting services to 
   multiple CPs the following general requirements from MACCNT-REQ-
   draft apply: 
    
        -Need for user tracking and billing capabilities 
        -Need for network access control and/or content access control 
   satisfactory to the requirements of the CP 
        -Methods for sharing information between the NSP and CP to make 
   the above two possible 
         
     
   When the NSP and CP are the same single entity the general 
   requirements are as follows. 
    
        -Need for user tracking and user-billing capabilities 
        -Need for access control and/or content protection at level the 
   entity deems appropriate

   A general high-level framework can be represented as follows.

            |                              | 
            +------------------------------+ 
 
   For the sake of simplicity, the above diagram portrays a case where 
   there is a single NSP entity and a single CP entity, but multiple 
   CPs can be connected to the same NSP. It is also possible for the 
   same CP to be connected to multiple NSP networks (e.g. network 
   selection).  In other words the relationship of NSP:CP can be 
   described as  1:1, 1:N or M:N.  Furthermore it is possible that the 
   NSP and CP could be the same entity.   
 
   Description of Roles: 
    
   The user (or the user's device) selects a CP and a NSP when the user 
   requests content. The NSP may be automatically selected by a user 
   terminal: e.g. a fixed line NSP for STB or a mobile NSP for mobile 
   phone.  In some usage cases it is possible that the NSP used by the 
   user terminal will not always be the same.  For example a user may 
   have contracted with different NSPs for fixed line or mobile roaming 
   access.  
    
   The CP is responsible for Authentication and Authorization of users' 
   access to content that the CP manages. The CP hopes to collect 
   accounting information related to the access of their content. The 
   CP may choose to authenticate and authorize NSPs which are eligible 
   to provide users access to its contents.  When the CP cannot (e.g. 
   error or resource issues) or decides not (e.g. policy issues) to 
   deliver content, the CP is responsible for notifying the NSP of the 
   reason.  It is up to the NSP how to relay or translate the messages 
   to the user.

   Internet Draft     AAA Framework for Multicasting     October 2006 
    
    
   The NSP is responsible for managing its network resources.  The NSP 
   may perform admission control. It is also responsible for relaying 
   the AAA messages from the CP whether the user is eligible to receive 
   content (authentication by proxy), and the NSPs relevant AAA server 
   will make the final decision of whether the connection can be 
   established.  When the NSP cannot or decides not to multicast to 
   users, the NSP is responsible for notifying the users of the reason. 
 
 
4.2 Multiple User IDs 
    
   Users may hold multiple user IDs: IDs which have been separately 
   assigned for each subscription they may have for various NSPs and 
   CPs.  When the user wants to access content or otherwise use the 
   network, the user registers the corresponding user ID with a request 
   for content, etc: web authentication is one possible method. 
    
   Terminal portability can be realized if the NSP authenticates a user 
   using a user ID. This allows the user to access the content from 
   various network access points. 
    
   Each CP may identify users by the user IDs that it has issued to 
   them. 
    
   The NSP and CP do not need to know the corresponding user id for the 
   same user in the other provider's domain, and it is not necessary 
   that there is a one to one relationship.  It is quite possible for 
   one person to hold multiple user ids for the same provider. 
    
4.3 Accounting 
    
   MACCNT-REQ-draft defines requirements for Accounting and Billing. 
   These include the requirement for the NSP to log user behavior such 
   as the join action and the leave action, as well as the result of 
   the access-control decision. (MACCNT-REQ-draft, 4.5) MACCNT-REQ-
   draft also specifies that there should be a standardized format for 
   sharing with the CP the user behavior and content reception 
   information which the NSP is logging.(MACCNT-REQ-draft, 4.5.1)   
    
   In order to provide the granularity of user-behavior and actual 
   content reception information as specified in MACCNT-REQ-draft, the 
   NSP should not manage multicast states on a subnet basis, but on a 
   user basis (see in MACCNT-REQ-draft, 4.1 "User identification") 
   because the NSP needs to be able to notify the CP of a user's start 
   and stop times for accounting purposes. This means that the NSP 
   sends to the CP AAA an indication for Join and Leave on a user basis.  
    
   This framework specifies an accounting API provided by the NSP and 
   accessed by the CP to allow for sharing user-behavior and content-
   reception information between the NSP AAA and CP AAA. This 
    
    
    
   Satou, Ohta, Hayashi, He                                   [Page 7] 
    
   Internet Draft     AAA Framework for Multicasting     October 2006 
    
    
   accounting API should be configurable to allow the CP to request 
   only the logging information it actually requires.  Such an API 
   would allow for realtime accounting information sharing by the NSP 
   to the CP. When logging information is shared through the accounting 
   API, it is important that the CP be able to match the user as 
   described in the database operated by the NSP to the user as 
   described in the database operated by the CP. 
 
   The NSP requires the capability to log both user and host 
   information for each join and leave, indicating the corresponding 
   multicast source for each action. When either a CP source stops 
   sending, or the NSP stops multicasting, in an unsolicited manner, 
   there is also a need to notify the AAA servers accordingly about the 
   users who are impacted by this event.  
    
   Also, intermittent logs between the join and leave would allow for 
   finer diagnostics and therefore could serve useful in billing 
   discrepancies, and provide for a better estimation of the time span 
   that content was multicasted in the even that users disconnect 
   without sending leave messages.  
    
    
 
4.4 Access Control and CP selection by NSP 
    
   When a NSP receives an access request from a user, it is necessary 
   for the NSP to determine to which CP the request is to be directed. 
   It is necessary for the NSP to ensure that it is not spoofed by an 
   inappropriate CP or user. 
 
 
4.5 API for Admission Control Information by NSP 
 
   After authorizing a user request, the NSP may have further 
   conditions for determining its admission control decision. MACCNT-
   REQ-draft defines requirements for providing the network capability 
   to conduct admission control based on the network bandwidth usage 
   status and bandwidth management policy. (MACCNT-REQ-draft, 4.2.2, 
   4.2.3 & 4.9) Such QoS measurement and policy mechanisms themselves 
   are out of the scope of this memo. However the NSP's AAA Server 
   should be provided with an Admission control API that allows for 
   interfacing so that additional conditions can be added to the 
   admission control decision.   
 
    
4.6 Access Control and Distinguishing of Users by CP 
    
   The user ID and authentication information are forwarded 
   transparently by the NSP so that the CP can distinguish the user, as 
   well as authenticate and authorize the request.

   Internet Draft     AAA Framework for Multicasting     October 2006 
    
    
    
4.7 Caching of AAA results 
    
   An NSP should be able to cache AAA results based upon an agreement 
   between the NSP and a CP.  The AAA cache would store information 
   about permissions of a specific user to receive multicast data from 
   specified channel(s) up to specified expiration date(s) and time(s).   
   If such caching is implemented, a method must exist for the CP to 
   communicate this permission information to the NSP.  The NSP refers 
   to the AAA cache and if the cache indicates that the user has 
   permission to receive multicast data from a specific channel at that 
   time, the NSP may forward the data without querying the CP.   
    
   It should be possible for a CP to send unsolicited requests to the 
   NSP to refresh or change the permissions for a user for specific 
   channel(s).   
    
   When a user is receiving multicast content and the permission is 
   about to expire, the NSP may send a notification to the user client 
   that his session is about to expire, and that he will need to re-
   connect. The user will have to reestablish a connection.  In the 
   case that the user still has permission to the content, they should 
   be able to continue to receive the content without interruption.  
    
    
5. Network Connection Model and Functional Components 
    
   Section 3.1 introduces the high-level AAA framework for multicasting.  
   This section provides more detail on the network connection model 
   and constituent functional components.  
 
5.1 Basic Connection Model 
    
                  +-------------+  
                  |     user    |

                          ^ Access & Resource 
                          | Request 
                          v 
                  +-------------+  
                  |     NSP     |  
                  |             |  
                  +-------------+  
                          ^ Access     
                          | Request    
                          v            
                  +-------------+   
                  |     CP      |   
                  |             |

   Internet Draft     AAA Framework for Multicasting     October 2006 
    
    
                  +-------------+   
    
   First a user that requests content sends an Access request to an NSP 
   which then forwards it on to the appropriate CP for Authentication 
   and Authorization purposes. The CP responds with either "success" or 
   "failure".  If "success", the NSP may forward a success response and 
   stream multicast data to the user. 
    
   In this model the user selects the NSP to which to send its content 
   request.  Based on this request the NSP selects an appropriate CP to 
   which it forwards the request. The CP responds to the NSP's request:  
   it may not respond to another NSP in regards to the request. 
    
   In this model, as described in section 3.1, the relationship between 
   NSP and CP can be 1:1, 1:N or M:N.  Users may connect to multiple 
   networks, and networks have multiple users.

   The diagram below shows that a Transit Provider(hereafter, TP)  may 
   relay requests between NSPs and CPs.

                  |     TP      |  
                  |             |  
                  +-------------+ 
                          ^ Access     
                          | Request    
                          v            
                  +-------------+   
                  |     CP      |   
                  |             |   
                  +-------------+   
    
   For the sake of simplification the above diagram shows a 1-1 
   relationship between an NSP and a TP.  However it is also possible 
   for a single NSP to connect to multiple TPs, and a single TP to 
   multiple NSPs.   
    
   A single TP may connect to one or more CPs. Similarly just as a 
   single CP may connect to multiple NSPs (as described in the general 
   high-level framework, section 3.1), a single CP may connect to one 
   or more TPs.   
     
   A solution will include a mechanism through which the NSPs know 
   which TP(s) are to be used to communicate with which CP(s), and CPs 
   know which TP(s) to use for which NSP(s).  When a TP receives an 
   access or resource request from an NSP or CP, it must relay the 
   request to the correct CP or NSP, respectively.  Minimally, this 
   means that it must reconstruct the request with translated address 
   information.  In this model therefore a TP must understand the 
   format and meaning of the requests.

   There may be multiple TPs between a NSP and CP so that a TP is 
   actually receiving from and/or sending requests to another TP and 
   not directly from/to a NSP or CP. 
    
5.3 Transit with Tunnels 
    
   In addition to the above model of request relaying, a TP may 
   communicate requests through tunneling based on the contract between 
   the TP and the NSP and/or between the TP and the CP.  So in this 
   case the TP will not directly need to process the contents of the 
   access and resource request (such as, header information), but 
   instead pass the request directly to the correct NSP or CP, using a 
   separate protocol to wrap the original requests. 
    
   Below is a diagram, representing how a TP can provide tunneling 
   between NSP(s) and CP(s).

                  +------------------+   
    
   In this model too, the relationship between NSP and TP and between 
   transit provider and CP can be 1:1, 1:N or M:N.

5.4 Constituent Logical Functional Components of the fully enabled AAA 
Framework 
    
   Section 3.1 introduces the high-level AAA framework for multicasting.  
   Below is a diagram of a fully enabled multicasting network with AAA, 
   including the logical components within the various entities. 
    
    
            +-------------------------------+ 
            |            user               | 
            |                               | 
            +-------------------------------+ 
                          ^ 
                          | Access & resource request 
                          v 
            +-------------------------------+ 
            |            NSP                | 
            |                               | 
            |+--------------+    +---------+| 
            ||NR Management |<-->|AAA Proxy||    (NR= network resource) 
            |+--------------+ RR +---------+|    (RR= resource request) 
            +-------------------------------+ 
                          ^ 
                          | Access request 
                          v 
            +------------------------------+ 
            |             CP               | 
            |                              | 
            |         +---------+          | 
            |         |   AAA   |          | 
            |         +---------+          | 
            +------------------------------+ 
    
   In the fully enabled model the NSP provides proxying of 
   authentication and authorization between the NSP and CP, as well as 
   user-based accounting.  The AAA proxy server of the NSP communicates 
   with the CP's AAA server.  Although not shown in the above diagram 
   for the sake of simplicity, in addition to direct proxying between a 
   NSP and CP, this proxying may be done through a TP.  This means that 
   the transit provider is also cable of supporting AAA proxying.  
    
   In the fully enabled model the NSP also includes a component that 
   provides network resource management (e.g. QoS management), as 
   described in section 3.4, "Network Resource Management by NSP".  
   When a transit provider is used it may also provide Network Resource 
   management of its own resources.   
    
5.5 Modularity of the framework 
    
    
    
    
   Satou, Ohta, Hayashi, He                                  [Page 13] 
    
   Internet Draft     AAA Framework for Multicasting     October 2006 
    
    
   In the interest of flexibility, this framework is modular so that it 
   is possible that partially enabled versions of the models are 
   supported.  A AAA-enabled version provides AAA functionality without 
   Network Resource management.  A Network-Resource-Management-enabled 
   (QoS-enabled) version provides Network Resource management without 
   AAA functionality.  Similarly, the possibility of one or more layers 
   of transit provision between an NSP and CP is in the interest of 
   modularity and extendibility. 
    
    
6. IANA considerations 
    
   This memo does not raise any IANA consideration issues. 
    
    
7. Security considerations 
    
   Refer to section 3.3.  Also the user information related to 
   authentication with the CP must be protected in some way.  Otherwise, 
   this memo does not raise any new security issues which are not 
   already addressed by the original protocols.  Enhancement of 
   multicast access control capabilities should enhance security 
   performance. 
    
    
8. Conclusion 
    
   This memo provides a generalized framework for solution standards to 
   meet the requirements presented in MACCNT-REQ-draft.  Further work 
   should be done to break down the content provider and network 
   service provider entities into their functional objects such as edge 
   devices, AAA servers, etc.
