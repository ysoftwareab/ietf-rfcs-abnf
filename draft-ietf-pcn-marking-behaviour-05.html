<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the
      quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain, in
      a simple, scalable, and robust fashion. This document defines the two
      metering and marking behaviours of PCN-nodes. Threshold-metering and
      -marking marks all PCN-packets if the rate of PCN-traffic is greater
      than a configured rate ("PCN-threshold-rate"). Excess-traffic-metering
      and -marking marks a proportion of PCN-packets, such that the amount
      marked equals the rate of PCN-traffic in excess of a configured rate
      ("PCN-excess-rate"). The level of marking allows PCN-boundary-nodes to
      make decisions about whether to admit or terminate PCN-flows.

Introduction</h3>

<p>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the
      quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain, in
      a simple, scalable, and robust fashion. Two mechanisms are used:
      admission control, to decide whether to admit or block a new flow
      request, and (in abnormal circumstances) flow termination to decide
      whether to terminate some of the existing flows. To achieve this, the
      overall rate of PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the domain, and
      PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain configured rates are
      exceeded. These configured rates are below the rate of the link thus
      providing notification to boundary nodes about overloads before any
      congestion occurs (hence "pre-congestion notification"). The level of
      marking allows boundary nodes to make decisions about whether to admit
      or terminate. Within the domain, PCN-traffic is forwarded in a
      prioritised Diffserv traffic class <a class='info' href='#RFC2475'>[RFC2475]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Blake, S., Black, D., Carlson, M., Davies, E., Wang, Z., and W. Weiss, &ldquo;An Architecture for Differentiated Services,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>This document defines the two metering and marking behaviours of
      PCN-nodes. Their aim is to enable PCN-nodes to give an "early warning"
      of potential congestion before there is any significant build-up of
      PCN-packets in their queues. In summary, their objectives are:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>threshold-metering and -marking: its objective is to mark all
          PCN-packets (with a "threshold-mark") when the bit rate of
          PCN-traffic is greater than its configured reference rate
          ("PCN-threshold-rate");
</li>
<li>excess traffic marking: when the bit rate of PCN-packets is
          greater than its configured reference rate ("PCN-excess-rate"), its
          objective is to mark PCN-packets (with an "excess-traffic-mark") at
          a rate equal to the difference between the rate of PCN-traffic and
          the PCN-excess-rate.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that although <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> defines a broadly
      RED-like (Random Early Detection) default congestion marking behaviour,
      it allows alternatives to be defined; this document defines such an
      alternative.
</p>
<p>Section 2 below describes the functions involved, which in outline
      (see Figure 1) are:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Behaviour aggregate (BA) classification: decide whether an
          incoming packet is a PCN-packet or not.
</li>
<li>Dropping (optional): drop packets if the link is overloaded.
</li>
<li>Threshold-meter: determine whether the bit rate of PCN-traffic
          exceeds its configured reference rate (PCN-threshold-rate). The
          meter operates on all PCN-packets on the link, and not on individual
          flows.
</li>
<li>Excess-traffic-meter: measure by how much the bit rate of
          PCN-traffic exceeds its configured reference rate (PCN-excess-rate).
          The meter operates on all PCN-packets on the link, and not on
          individual flows.
</li>
<li>PCN-mark: actually mark the PCN-packets, if the meter functions
          indicate to do so.
</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the terminology defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC5559'>[RFC5559]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eardley, P., &ldquo;Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) Architecture,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#RFC2474'>[RFC2474]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nichols, K., Blake, S., Baker, F., and D. Black, &ldquo;Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>, the
        following terms are defined:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Competing-non-PCN-packet: a non PCN-packet that shares a link
            with PCN-packets and competes with them for its forwarding
            bandwidth. Competing-non-PCN-packets MUST NOT be PCN-marked (only
            PCN-packets can be PCN-marked). Note: In general it is not advised
            to have any competing-non-PCN-traffic. Note: there is likely to be
            traffic (such as best effort) that is forwarded at lower priority
            than PCN-traffic; although it shares the link with PCN-traffic it
            doesn't compete for forwarding bandwidth, and hence it is not
            competing-non-PCN-traffic. See Appendix B.1 for further discussion
            about competing-non-PCN-traffic.
</li>
<li>Metered-packet: a packet that is metered by the metering
            functions specified in Sections 2.3 and 2.4. A PCN-packet MUST be
            treated as a metered-packet (with the minor exception noted below
            in Section 2.4). A competing-non-PCN-packet MAY be treated as a
            metered-packet.
</li>

Specified PCN-metering and -marking behaviours</h3>

Behaviour aggregate classification function</h3>

<p>A PCN-node MUST classify a packet as a PCN-packet if the value of
        its DSCP and ECN fields correspond to a PCN-enabled codepoint, as
        defined in the encoding scheme applicable to the PCN-domain (for
        example, <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;pcn&#8209;baseline&#8209;encoding]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Moncaster, T., Briscoe, B., and M.

        the baseline encoding). Otherwise the packet MUST NOT be classified as
        a PCN-packet.
</p>
<p>A PCN-node MUST classify a packet as a competing-non-PCN-packet if
        it is not a PCN-packet and it competes with PCN-packets for its
        forwarding bandwidth on a link.

Dropping function</h3>

<p>Note: if the PCN-node's queue overflows then naturally packets are
        dropped. This section describes additional action.
</p>
<p>On all links in the PCN-domain, dropping MAY be done by:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>metering all metered-packets to determine if the rate of
            metered-traffic on the link is greater than the rate allowed for
            such traffic.
</li>
<li>if the rate of metered-traffic is too high, then drop

</ul><p>If the PCN-node drops PCN-packets then:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>PCN-packets that arrive at the PCN-node already
            excess-traffic-marked SHOULD be preferentially dropped;
</li>

<a name="rfc.section.2.3"></a><h3>2.3.&nbsp;
Threshold-meter function</h3>

<p>A PCN-node MUST implement a threshold-meter that has behaviour
        functionally equivalent to the following.
</p>
<p>The meter acts like a token bucket, which is sized in bits and has
        a configured reference rate (bits per second). The amount of tokens in
        the token bucket is termed F_tm. Tokens are added at the reference
        rate (PCN-threshold-rate), to a maximum value BS_tm. Tokens are
        removed equal to the size in bits of the metered-packet, to a minimum
        F_tm = 0. (Explanation of abbreviations: F is short for Fill of the
        token bucket, BS for bucket size, and tm for threshold-meter.)
</p>
<p>The token bucket has a configured intermediate depth, termed
        threshold. If F_tm &lt; threshold, then the meter indicates to the
        marking function that the packet is to be threshold-marked; otherwise
        it does not.

<a name="rfc.section.2.4"></a><h3>2.4.&nbsp;
Excess-traffic-meter function</h3>

<p>A packet SHOULD NOT be metered (by this excess-traffic-meter
        function) in the following two cases:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If the PCN-packet is already excess-traffic-marked on arrival
            at the PCN-node;
</li>
<li>If this PCN-node drops the packet.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Otherwise the PCN-packet MUST be treated as a metered-packet, that
        is it is metered by the excess-traffic-meter.
</p>
<p>A PCN-node MUST implement an excess-traffic-meter. The
        excess-traffic-meter SHOULD indicate packets to be
        excess-traffic-marked independent of their size ("packet size
        independent marking"); if "packet size independent marking" is not
        implemented then the excess-traffic-meter MUST use the
        &ldquo;classic&rdquo; metering behaviour.
</p>
<p>For the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; metering behaviour the
        excess-traffic-meter has behaviour functionally equivalent to the
        following.
</p>
<p>The meter acts like a token bucket, which is sized in bits and has
        a configured reference rate (bits per second). The amount of tokens in
        the token bucket is termed F_etm. Tokens are added at the reference
        rate (PCN-excess-rate), to a maximum value BS_etm. Tokens are removed
        equal to the size in bits of the metered-packet, to a minimum F_etm =
        0. If the token bucket is empty (F_etm = 0), then the meter indicates
        to the marking function that the packet is to be
        excess-traffic-marked. (Explanation of abbreviations: F is short for
        Fill of the token bucket, BS for bucket size, and etm for
        excess-traffic-meter.)
</p>
<p>For "packet size independent marking" the excess-traffic-meter has
        behaviour functionally equivalent to the following. The meter acts
        like a token bucket, which is sized in bits and has a configured
        reference rate (bits per second). The amount of tokens in the token
        bucket is termed F_etm. Tokens are added at the reference rate
        (PCN-excess-rate), to a maximum value BS_etm. If the token bucket is
        not negative, then tokens are removed equal to the size in bits of the
        metered-packet (and the meter does not indicate to the marking
        function that the packet is to be excess-traffic-marked). If the token
        bucket is negative (F_etm &lt; 0), then the meter indicates to the
        marking function that the packet is to be excess-traffic-marked (and
        no tokens are removed). (Explanation of abbreviations: F is short for
        Fill of the token bucket, BS for bucket size, and etm for
        excess-traffic-meter.)
</p>
<p>Otherwise the meter MUST NOT indicate marking.

<a name="rfc.section.2.5"></a><h3>2.5.&nbsp;
Marking function</h3>

<p>A PCN-packet MUST be marked to reflect the metering results by
        setting its encoding state appropriately, as specified by the specific
        encoding scheme that applies in the PCN-domain. A consistent choice of
        encoding scheme MUST be made throughout a PCN-domain.
</p>
<p>A PCN-node MUST NOT:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>PCN-mark a packet that is not a PCN-packet;
</li>
<li>change a non PCN-packet into a PCN-packet;
</li>
<li>change a PCN-packet into a non PCN-packet.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: although competing-non-PCN-packets MAY be metered, they MUST
        NOT be PCN-marked.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>It is assumed that all PCN-nodes are PCN-enabled and are trusted for
      truthful PCN-metering and PCN-marking. If this isn't the case then there
      are numerous potential attacks. For instance, a rogue PCN-interior-node
      could PCN-mark all packets so that no flows were admitted. Another
      possibility is that it doesn't PCN-mark any packets, even when it is
      pre-congested. 
</p>
<p>Note that PCN-interior-nodes are not flow-aware. This prevents some
      security attacks where an attacker targets specific flows in the data
      plane -- for instance, for DoS or eavesdropping.
</p>
<p>As regards Security Operations and Management, PCN adds few specifics
      to the general good practice required in this field <a class='info' href='#RFC4778'>[RFC4778]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kaeo, M., &ldquo;Operational Security Current Practices in Internet Service Provider Environments,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. For example, it may be sensible for a PCN-node
      to raise an alarm if it is persistently PCN-marking.
</p>
<p>Security considerations are further discussed in <a class='info' href='#RFC5559'>[RFC5559]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eardley, P., &ldquo;Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) Architecture,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Changes to -05 from -04</h3>

<p>Updates to take account of IESG comments as follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>S1: added refs to PCN background
</li>
<li>S1: corrected "standardises" to "describes"
</li>
<li>S1: for clarity added: "Within the domain, PCN-traffic is
            forwarded in a prioritised Diffserv traffic class [RFC2475]."
</li>
<li>S1.1: added note to clarify that Best Effort traffic isn't
            competing-non-PCN-traffic: "Note: there is likely to be traffic
            (such as best effort) that is forwarded at lower priority than
            PCN-traffic; although it shares the link with PCN-traffic it
            doesn't compete for forwarding bandwidth, and hence it is not
            competing-non-PCN-traffic. See Appendix B.1 for further discussion
            about competing-non-PCN-traffic."
</li>
<li>S2.3 &amp; 2.4: added units for reference rate of token
            buckets: "(bits per second)"
</li>
<li>S2.4, "Packet size independent (excess-traffic-)marking": added
            clarification about behaviour if token bucket is negative: "(and
            no tokens are removed)". Swapped two sentences round for clarity,
            so first describe behaviour if token bucket is non negative and
            then behaviour if token bucket is negative.
</li>
<li>S4: deleted the sentence "More subtly...", as this might be
            misconstrued as implying PCN-interior-nodes are flow-aware.
</li>
<li>S8: upgraded RFC2119 to normative ref
</li>
<li>SB.6, "Packet size independent (excess-traffic-)marking": added
            clarification: &lt;Note that with "packet size independent
            marking", either the packet is marked or tokens are removed --
            never both. Hence the token bucket cannot become more negative
            than the maximum packet size on the link.&gt;

<li>Expanded RED, and other minor typos and clarifications

Changes to -04 from -03</h3>

<p>Updates to take account of IETF last call comments, including a
        Gen-ART review from David Black and OPS DIR review from Mehmet Ersue,
        as follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>re-phrased of S2.2 first bullet for clarity
</li>
<li>S2.4 re-phrased, so that competing-non-PCN-packets that are
            metered are covered by the "SHOULD NOT be metered ..." text
</li>
<li>"Packet size independent (excess-traffic-)marking": re-phrased
            the para in 2.4 for clarity; altered the algorithm in Appendix A
            so it does PSIM; clarified the explanation in Appendix B.6 in
            light of this. Clarified that if packet size independent marking
            (the SHOULD behaviour) is implemented, then the 'classic' marking
            doesn't have to be (ie it's only a MUST if PSIM isn't
            implemented). Also added info on 'functionally equivalent'
            behaviour for PSIM.

Changes to -00</h3>

<p>First version of WG draft, derived from
        draft-eardley-pcn-marking-behaviour-01, with the following
        changes:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Removed material concerning per domain behaviour and
            PCN-boundary-node operation (temporarily archived to Appendix
            C)
</li>
<li>Removed mention of downgrading as an option for per-hop traffic
            conditioning. In fact, downgrading is no longer allowed because S
            2.6 now says "A PCN-node MUST NOT ...change a PCN-packet into a
            non PCN-packet".
</li>
<li>Traffic conditioning is now a MAY. Since in general flow
            termination (not traffic conditioning) is PCN's method for
            handling problems of too much traffic.
</li>
<li>Metered-packets: competing-non-PCN-packets now MAY be metered.

<p>There is no attempt to optimise the algorithms. The metering and

      all metered-packets are PCN-packets and that the link is never

      marking" applies.

Competing-non-PCN-traffic</h3>

<p>In general it is not advised to have any competing-non-PCN-traffic,
        essentially because the unpredictable amount of
        competing-non-PCN-traffic makes the PCN mechanisms less accurate and
        so reduces PCN's ability to protect the QoS of admitted PCN-flows
        <a class='info' href='#RFC5559'>[RFC5559]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eardley, P., &ldquo;Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) Architecture,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. But if there is
        competing-non-PCN-traffic, then:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>There should be a mechanism to limit it, for example:
<ul class="text">
<li>limit the rate at which competing-non-PCN-traffic can be
                forwarded on each link in the PCN-domain. One method for
                achieving this is to queue competing-non-PCN-packets
                separately from PCN-packets, and to limit the scheduling rate
                of the former. Another method is to drop
                competing-non-PCN-packets in excess of some rate.
</li>
<li>police competing-non-PCN-traffic at the PCN-ingress-nodes.
                For example, as in the Diffserv architecture - however, its
                static traffic conditioning agreements risk a focused overload
                of traffic from several PCN-ingress-nodes onto one link.
</li>
<li>by design it is known that the level of
                competing-non-PCN-traffic is always very small - perhaps it
                consists of operator control messages only.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In general PCN's mechanisms should take account of
            competing-non-PCN-traffic, in order to improve the accuracy of the
            decision about whether to admit (or terminate) a PCN-flow. For
            example:
<ul class="text">
<li>competing-non-PCN-traffic contributes to the PCN meters:
                competing-non-PCN-packets are treated as metered-packets.
</li>
<li>each PCN-node, on its links: (1) reduces the reference
                rates (PCN-threshold-rate and PCN-excess-rate), in order to
                allow 'headroom' for the competing-non-PCN-traffic; (2) limits
                the maximum forwarding rate of competing-non-PCN-traffic to be
                less than the 'headroom'. In this case
                competing-non-PCN-packets are not treated as
                metered-packets.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The operator should decide on what appropriate action. Dropping
            is discussed further in Section B.4.
</li>
</ol>

<p>One specific example of competing-non-PCN-traffic occurs if the
        PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint is one of those that <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-tsvwg-admitted-realtime-dscp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;tsvwg&#8209;admitted&#8209;realtime&#8209;dscp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baker, F., Polk, J., and M. Dolly, &ldquo;DSCP for Capacity-Admitted Traffic,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>) defines as
        suitable for use with admission control, and there is such non
        PCN-traffic in the PCN-domain. A similar example could occur for
        Diffserv codepoints of the Real-Time Treatment Aggregate <a class='info' href='#RFC5127'>[RFC5127]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Chan, K., Babiarz, J., and F. Baker, &ldquo;Aggregation of DiffServ Service Classes,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>). In such cases PCN-traffic and
        competing-non-PCN-traffic are distinguished by different values of the
        ECN field <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;pcn&#8209;baseline&#8209;encoding]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Moncaster, T., Briscoe, B., and M. Menth, &ldquo;Baseline Encoding and Transport of Pre-Congestion Information,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Another example would occur if there is more than one
        PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint in a PCN-domain. For instance,
        suppose there are two PCN-BAs treated at different priorities. Then as
        far as the lower priority PCN-BA is concerned, the higher priority
        PCN-traffic needs to be treated as competing-non-PCN-traffic.

Scope</h3>

<p>It may be known, for instance by the design of the network
        topology, that some links can never be pre-congested (even in unusual
        circumstances, such as after the failure of some links). There is then
        no need to deploy the PCN metering and marking behaviour on those
        links.
</p>
<p>The meters can be implemented on the ingoing or outgoing interface
        of a PCN-node. It may be that existing hardware can support only one
        meter per ingoing interface and one per outgoing interface. Then for
        instance threshold-metering could be run on all the ingoing interfaces
        and excess-traffic-metering on all the outgoing interfaces; note that
        the same choice must be made for all the links in a PCN-domain to
        ensure that the two metering behaviours are applied exactly once for
        all the links.
</p>
<p>The baseline encoding <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;pcn&#8209;baseline&#8209;encoding]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Moncaster, T., Briscoe, B., and M. Menth, &ldquo;Baseline Encoding and Transport of Pre-Congestion Information,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> specifies only two
        encoding states (PCN-marked and not-marked). In this case,
        "excess-traffic-marked" means a packet that is PCN-marked as a result
        of the excess-traffic-meter function, and "threshold-marked" means a
        packet that is PCN-marked as a result of the threshold-meter function.
        As far as terminology is concerned, this interpretation is consistent
        with that defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC5559'>[RFC5559]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eardley, P., &ldquo;Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) Architecture,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. Note that a
        deployment needs to make a consistent choice throughout the PCN-domain
        whether PCN-marked is interpreted as excess-traffic-marked or
        threshold-marked.
</p>
<p>Note that even if there are only two encoding states, it is still
        required that both the meters are implemented, in order to ease
        compatibility between equipment, and to remove a configuration option
        and associated complexity. Hardware with limited availability of token
        buckets could be configured to run only one of the meters, but it must
        be possible to enable either meter. Although in the scenario with two
        encoding states, indications from one of the meters are ignored by the
        marking function, they may be logged or acted upon in some other way,
        for example by the management system or an explicit signalling
        protocol; such considerations are out of scope of this document.

Dropping</h3>

<p>The objective of the dropping function is to minimise the queueing
        delay suffered by metered-traffic at a PCN-node, since PCN-traffic
        (and perhaps competing-non-PCN-traffic) is expected to be inelastic
        traffic generated by real time applications. In practice it would be
        defined as exceeding a specific traffic profile, typically based on a
        token bucket.
</p>
<p>If there is no competing-non-PCN-traffic, then it is not expected
        that the dropping function is needed, since PCN's flow admission and
        termination mechanisms limit the amount of PCN-traffic. Even so, it
        still might be implemented as a back stop against misconfiguration of
        the PCN-domain, for instance.
</p>
<p>If there is competing-non-PCN-traffic, then the details of the
        dropping function will depend on how the router's implementation
        handles the two sorts of traffic (the discussion here is based on that
        in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-tsvwg-admitted-realtime-dscp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;tsvwg&#8209;admitted&#8209;realtime&#8209;dscp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baker, F., Polk, J., and M. Dolly, &ldquo;DSCP for Capacity-Admitted Traffic,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>):
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>a common queue for PCN-traffic and competing-non-PCN-traffic,
            and a traffic conditioner for the competing-non-PCN-traffic;
            or
</li>
<li>separate queues. In this case the amount of
            competing-non-PCN-traffic can be limited by limiting the rate at
            which the scheduler (for the competing-non-PCN-traffic) forwards
            packets.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that only dropping of packets is allowed. Downgrading of
        packets to a lower priority BA is not allowed (see B.7), since it
        would lead to packet mis-ordering. Shaping ("the process of delaying
        packets" <a class='info' href='#RFC2475'>[RFC2475]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Blake, S., Black, D., Carlson, M., Davies, E., Wang, Z., and W. Weiss, &ldquo;An Architecture for Differentiated Services,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>) is not suitable if the
        traffic comes from real time applications.
</p>
<p>Preferential dropping of competing-non-PCN-traffic: In general it
        is reasonable for competing-non-PCN-traffic to get harsher treatment
        than PCN-traffic (that is, competing-non-PCN-packets are
        preferentially dropped), because PCN's flow admission and termination
        mechanisms are stronger than the mechanisms that are likely to be
        applied to the competing-non-PCN-traffic. The PCN mechanisms also mean
        that a dropper should not be needed for the PCN-traffic.
</p>
<p>Preferential dropping of excess-traffic-marked packets: Section 2.3
        specifies: "If the PCN-node drops PCN-packets then ... PCN-packets
        that arrive at the PCN-node already excess-traffic-marked SHOULD be
        preferentially dropped". In brief, the reason is that, with the
        "controlled load" edge behaviour <a class='info' href='#I-D.taylor-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour'>[I&#8209;D.taylor&#8209;pcn&#8209;cl&#8209;edge&#8209;behaviour]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Charny, A., Huang, F., Menth, M., and T. Taylor, &ldquo;PCN Boundary Node Behaviour for the Controlled Load (CL) Mode of Operation,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> this avoids
        over-termination in the event of multiple bottlenecks in the
        PCN-domain <a class='info' href='#I-D.charny-pcn-comparison'>[I&#8209;D.charny&#8209;pcn&#8209;comparison]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Charny, A., &ldquo;Comparison of Proposed PCN Approaches,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. A fuller
        explanation is as follows. The optimal dropping behaviour depends on
        the particular edge behaviour <a class='info' href='#Menth09'>[Menth09]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Menth, M., Lehrieder, F., Briscoe, B., Eardley, P., Moncaster, T., Babiarz, J., Chan, K., Charny, A., Karagiannis, G., Zhang, X., Taylor, T., Satoh, D., and R. Geib, &ldquo;A Survey of PCN-Based Admission Control and Flow           Termination,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. A single
        dropping behaviour is defined, as it is simpler to standardise,
        implement and operate. The standardised dropping behaviour is at least
        adequate for all edge behaviours (and good for some), whereas others
        are not (for example with tail dropping far too much traffic may be
        terminated with the "controlled load" edge behaviour, in the event of
        multiple bottlenecks in the PCN-domain <a class='info' href='#I-D.charny-pcn-comparison'>[I&#8209;D.charny&#8209;pcn&#8209;comparison]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Charny, A., &ldquo;Comparison of Proposed PCN Approaches,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>). The dropping behaviour is
        defined as a &lsquo;SHOULD&rsquo;, rather than a &lsquo;MUST&rsquo;,
        in recognition that other dropping behaviour may be preferred in
        particular circumstances, for example: (1) with the "marked flow"
        termination edge behaviour, preferential dropping of unmarked packets
        may be better <a class='info' href='#Menth09'>[Menth09]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Menth, M., Lehrieder, F., Briscoe, B., Eardley, P., Moncaster, T., Babiarz, J., Chan, K., Charny, A., Karagiannis, G., Zhang, X., Taylor, T., Satoh, D., and R. Geib, &ldquo;A Survey of PCN-Based Admission Control and Flow           Termination,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>; (2) tail dropping may
        make PCN-marking behaviour easier to implement on current routers.
</p>
<p>Exactly what "preferentially dropped" means is left to the
        implementation. It is also left to the implementation what to do if
        there are no excess-traffic-marked PCN-packets available at a
        particular instant.
</p>
<p>Section 2.2 also specifies: "the PCN-node's excess-traffic-meter
        SHOULD NOT meter the PCN-packets that it drops." This avoids
        over-termination <a class='info' href='#Menth09'>[Menth09]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Menth, M., Lehrieder, F., Briscoe, B., Eardley, P., Moncaster, T., Babiarz, J., Chan, K., Charny, A., Karagiannis, G., Zhang, X., Taylor, T., Satoh, D., and R. Geib, &ldquo;A Survey of PCN-Based Admission Control and Flow           Termination,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. Effectively it means
        that the dropping function (if present) should be done before the
        meter functions - which is natural.

Threshold-metering</h3>

<p>The description is in terms of a &lsquo;token bucket with
        threshold&rsquo; (which <a class='info' href='#I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture'>[I&#8209;D.briscoe&#8209;tsvwg&#8209;cl&#8209;architecture]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Briscoe, B., &ldquo;An edge-to-edge Deployment Model for Pre-Congestion Notification: Admission  Control over a DiffServ Region,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> views as a virtual
        queue). However the description is not intended to standardise
        implementation.
</p>
<p>The reference rate of the threshold-meter (PCN-threshold-rate) is
        configured at less than the rate allocated to the PCN-traffic class.
        Also, the PCN-threshold-rate is less than, or possibly equal to, the
        PCN-excess-rate.
</p>
<p>Section 2.3 defines: "If F_tm &lt; threshold, then the meter
        indicates to the marking function that the packet is to be
        threshold-marked; otherwise it does not." Note that a PCN-packet is
        marked without explicit additional bias for the packet's size.
</p>
<p>The behaviour must be functionally equivalent to the description in
        Section 2.3. "Functionally equivalent" means the observable 'black
        box' behaviour is the same or very similar, for example if either
        precisely the same set of packets is marked, or if the set is shifted
        by one packet. It is intended to allow implementation freedom over
        matters such as:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>whether tokens are added to the token bucket at regular time
            intervals or only when a packet is processed.
</li>
<li>whether the new token bucket depth is calculated before or
            after it is decided whether to PCN-mark the packet. The effect of
            this is simply to shift the sequence of marks by one packet.
</li>
<li>when the token bucket is very nearly empty and a packet arrives
            larger than F_tm, then the precise change in F_tm is up to the
            implementation. For instance:
<ul class="text">
<li>set F_tm = 0 and indicate threshold-mark to the Marking
                function.
</li>
<li>check whether F_tm &lt; threshold and if it is then
                indicate threshold-mark to the Marking function; then set F_tm
                = 0.
</li>
<li>leave F_tm unaltered and indicate threshold-mark to the
                Marking function.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="text">
<li><p>similarly, when the token bucket is very nearly full and a
            packet arrives larger than (BStm - F_tm), then the precise change
            in F_tm is up to the implementation.
</li>
<li>Note that all PCN-packets, even if already marked, are metered
            by the threshold-meter function (unlike the excess-traffic-meter
            function), because all packets should contribute to the decision
            whether there is room for a new flow.

<a name="rfc.section.B.6"></a><h3>B.6.&nbsp;
Excess-traffic-metering</h3>

<p>The description is in terms of a token bucket, however the
        implementation is not standardised.
</p>
<p>The reference rate of the excess-traffic-meter (PCN-excess-rate) is
        configured at less than (or possibly equal to) the rate allocated to
        the PCN-traffic class. Also, the PCN-excess-rate is greater than, or
        possibly equal to, the PCN-threshold-rate.
</p>
<p>As in Section B.3, "functionally equivalent" allows some
        implementation flexibility, for example the exact algorithm when the
        token bucket is very nearly empty or very nearly full.
</p>
<p>Section 2.4 specifies: "A packet SHOULD NOT be metered (by this
        excess traffic meter function) ... If the packet is already
        excess-traffic-marked on arrival at the PCN-node". This avoids
        over-termination (with some edge behaviours) in the event that the
        PCN-traffic passes through multiple bottlenecks in the PCN-domain
        <a class='info' href='#I-D.charny-pcn-comparison'>[I&#8209;D.charny&#8209;pcn&#8209;comparison]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Charny, A., &ldquo;Comparison of Proposed PCN Approaches,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. Note that an
        implementation could determine whether the packet is already
        excess-traffic-marked as an integral part of its BA classification
        function. The behaviour is defined as a &lsquo;SHOULD NOT&rsquo;,
        rather than a &lsquo;MUST NOT&rsquo;, because it may be slightly
        harder to implement than a metering function that is blind to previous
        packet markings.
</p>
<p>Section 2.4 specifies: "A packet SHOULD NOT be metered (by this
        excess traffic meter function) ... If this PCN-node drops the packet."
        This avoids over-termination <a class='info' href='#Menth09'>[Menth09]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Menth, M., Lehrieder, F., Briscoe, B., Eardley, P., Moncaster, T., Babiarz, J., Chan, K., Charny, A., Karagiannis, G., Zhang, X., Taylor, T., Satoh, D., and R. Geib, &ldquo;A Survey of PCN-Based Admission Control and Flow           Termination,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. (A
        similar statement could also be made for the threshold meter function
        but is irrelevant, as a link that is overloaded will already be
        substantially pre-congested and hence threshold-marking all packets.)
        It seems natural to perform the dropping function before the metering
        functions, although for some equipment it may be harder to implement;
        hence the behaviour is defined as a &lsquo;SHOULD NOT&rsquo;, rather
        than a &lsquo;MUST NOT&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>"Packet size independent marking" - excess-traffic-marking that is
        independent of packet size - is specified as a SHOULD rather than a
        'MUST' in Section 2.4, because it may be slightly harder for some
        equipment to implement, and the impact of not doing it is undesirable
        but moderate (sufficient traffic is terminated, but flows with large
        packets are more likely to be terminated). With the
        &ldquo;classic&rdquo; excess-traffic-meter behaviour, large packets
        are more likely to be excess-traffic-marked than small packets
        (because packets are marked if the number of tokens in the packet is
        smaller than the packet size). This means that, with some edge
        behaviours, flows with large packets are more likely to be terminated
        than flows with small packets <a class='info' href='#I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-byte-pkt-mark'>[I&#8209;D.briscoe&#8209;tsvwg&#8209;byte&#8209;pkt&#8209;mark]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Briscoe, B., &ldquo;Byte and Packet Congestion Notification,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> <a class='info' href='#Menth09'>[Menth09]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Menth, M., Lehrieder, F., Briscoe, B., Eardley, P., Moncaster, T., Babiarz, J., Chan, K., Charny, A., Karagiannis, G., Zhang, X., Taylor, T., Satoh, D., and R. Geib, &ldquo;A Survey of PCN-Based Admission Control and Flow           Termination,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. "Packet size independent marking" can be
        achieved by a small modification of the &ldquo;classic&rdquo;
        excess-traffic-meter: the number of tokens in the bucket can become
        negative; if this number is negative at a packet's arrival, the packet
        is marked; otherwise, the amount of tokens equal to the packet size is
        removed from the bucket. Note that with "packet size independent
        marking", either the packet is marked or tokens are removed -- never
        both. Hence the token bucket cannot become more negative than the
        maximum packet size on the link. The algorithm described in Appendix A
        implements this behaviour.
</p>
<p>Note that BS_etm is independent of BStm; F_etm is independent of
        F_tm (except in that a packet can change both); and the two configured
        rates (PCN-excess-rate and PCN-threshold-rate) are independent (except
        that PCN-excess-rate &gt;= PCN-threshold-rate).

Marking</h3>

<p>Section 2.5 defines: "A PCN-node MUST NOT ...change a PCN-packet
        into a non PCN-packet". This means that a PCN-node is not allowed to
        downgrade a PCN-packet into a lower priority Diffserv BA (hence
        downgrading is not allowed as an alternative to dropping).
</p>
<p>Section 2.5 defines: "A PCN-node MUST NOT ...PCN-mark a packet that
        is not a PCN-packet". This means that in the scenario where
        competing-non-PCN-packets are treated as metered-packets, a meter may
        indicate a packet is to be PCN-marked, but the marking function knows
        it cannot be marked. It is left open to the implementation exactly
        what to do in this case; one simple possibility is to mark the next
        PCN-packet. Note that unless the PCN-packets are a large fraction of
        all the metered-packets then the PCN mechanisms may not work well.
</p>
<p>Although the metering functions are described separately from the
        marking function, they can be implemented in an integrated
        fashion.
