                 Energy-efficient Management Framework
          draft-ychoi-eman-energy-efficient-management-01.txt

Abstract

   Wireless network devices which have limited resources (e.g., power
   supply, memory, computing capabilities, and so on) should consider
   energy-efficient management.  However, the existing network
   architectures for the network devices have some problems on energy
   management about device failures and errors.  To improve the energy
   management problem, this document proposes energy-efficient
   management framework for the network devices.

1.  Introduction

   Energy efficiency is one of the important issues for wireless
   constrained network devices, which have limited resources as low-cost
   and low-power devices, such as power supply, memory, computing
   capability, and so on.  Therefore, this document specifies motivation
   and functional architecture of energy efficient management for such
   light weight low-cost network devices so that the network devices can
   reduce energy consumption.  Then, it describe specification for
   network device control as follows:

   o  Motivation for energy efficient management of network devices;

   o  Functional architecture and requirements of energy efficient
      management;

   o  Operational procedures and messages for device delegation control

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Overview of Energy-efficient Management Framework

   Wireless network devices which have limited resources (e.g., power
   supply, memory, computing capabilities, and so on) should consider
   energy-efficient management as one of the important functions when
   they are designed for applications.  However, the existing network
   architectures for resource-constrained network devices have some
   problems on energy management because they typically have
   architectures to support both control plane and data plane.  For
   example, one of the network devices which gets in troubles on power
   supply, gives negative effects on energy waste of the other network
   devices to recover the errors.  As the worst case, network overhead,
   such as message broadcasting, could be required.

   To improve such a problem, roles of network devices should be
   minimized for data obtaining and forwarding, and control plane, such
   as topology control and routing control, should be taken by the other
   entity, which do not have resource-constraint.  Therefore, this
   document describes requirements and considerations for energy-
   efficient management framework based on general application scenarios
   of the existing network architectures.  Then reference architectures
   for separation of control plane and data plane is stated, and also
   procedures for network initializing, on-demand, and event-driven
   process are specified.

4.  Requirements and Considerations of Energy Management Framework

   This section provides a scenario to show an example of energy
   consumption in wireless low-power network devices which have light-
   weight and low-cost properties, then requirements and considerations
   to reduce energy consumption are analysed based on the scenario.

4.1.  Scenarios for Energy Consumption Analysis

   There are two applications, such as target-tracking services and
   temperature reporting services, provided.  In the network, there are
   two kinds of devices.  One is to obtain temperature data, the other
   is for target-tracking.

      Figure 1: Scenario of an application for temperature reporting
                                 services

   In Figure 1, a user wants to know current temperature of the network
   field, so the user requests temperature information to a gateway.
   The gateway should recognize which one of the deployed devices can be
   available in the field.  The gateway starts message broadcasting to
   discover devices available, and the available devices reply to the
   gateway by hop-by-hop networking.  If the number of the available

   devices is satisfied for providing temperature information, the
   gateway delivers a task to gather temperature data to the available
   devices.  The task is broadcasted to all of the devices.  Whenever
   the devices obtain temperature data, the data is delivered to the
   gateway through hop-by-hop networking.  When all of the temperature
   data obtained are collected to gateway, the data is processed to
   temperature information and provided to the user.

     Figure 2: Scenario of an application for target-tracking services

   Figure 2 shows another scenario, which is for target-tracking.  A
   user wants to know current location information of a target in the
   network field, so the user requests target location information to a
   gateway.  The gateway should recognize which one of the deployed
   devices can be available in the field.  The gateway starts message
   broadcasting to discover devices available, and the available devices
   reply to the gateway by hop-by-hop networking.  If the number of the
   available devices is satisfied for providing temperature information,
   the gateway delivers a task to gather temperature data to the
   available devices.  The task is broadcasted to all of the devices.
   Whenever the target moves to another location, the devices obtain

   location data of the target.  Then the data is delivered to the
   gateway through hop-by-hop networking, and real-time location
   information of the target is provided to the user.

   In the two scenarios, the two different application services, such as
   temperature reporting and target-tracking, are provided in the same
   network.  Some of the devices are involved into the temperature
   reporting, the others are involved into the target-tracking, but all
   devices commonly participated in message broadcasting, task
   broadcasting, and data delivering without regard to the types of
   application services.

4.2.  Requirements and Considerations

   In the two scenarios, lots of possible situations of energy
   consumption exist while network devices are operated to provide
   application services.  If such a network architecture is redesigned
   to improve inefficient energy consumption, several requirements and
   considerations need to be reflected as follows:

4.2.1.  Separation of Control Plane and Data Plane

   In the scenarios, there are two kinds of devices; one is for the
   temperature reporting application, and the other is for target-
   tracking application.  There is no devices for both of them.
   However, they should participate in message broadcasting, task
   broadcasting, and obtained data delivering to gateway.  Especially,
   broadcasting messages and tasks is one of the most critical ways to
   inefficient energy consumption.  To minimize the inefficient energy
   consumption, network devices should mainly participate in data
   delivering or data forwarding in data plane.  Instead, control plane
   can be operated by the other centralized methodology, such as the
   gateway.  Then such a broadcasting method can be reduced.

4.2.2.  Centralized Control Support

   To discover neighbours and routing paths, typically all network
   devices should involve in processes in control plane.  However, if an
   entity (i.e., a centralized controller) is aware of all the
   information (e.g., location, remaining energy levels, etc.) of the
   network devices in a local network, only the entity can computes and
   create routing paths and links among the network devices.  In other
   words, the network devices can reduce energy consumption.  The
   centralized entity can be a third party or gateway.

Internet-Draft                    EEMF                        April 2014


4.2.3.  Versatile and Programmable

   If a network architecture is conveniently designed to apply for
   various application services, it gives a positive influence to
   efficient energy consumption.  For example, requirements for service
   types, such as on-demand reporting, regularly reporting, and event-
   driven reporting, can be temporally changed in temperature reporting
   services.  Therefore, energy managements need to be differently
   programed and changed for the service types.

4.2.4.  Remote Monitoring and Managements

   To centrally control network devices, remotely monitoring and
   management are required.

4.2.5.  Channel Support to Control Network Devices

   To remotely manage network devices, protocols for control plane is
   supported between network devices and centralized entity.

5.  Reference Architecture of Energy-efficient Management Framework for
    Constrained Network Devices

5.1.  Reference Architecture

   As above the requirements and considerations in Section 4.2, energy-
   efficient management framework is divided into three parts, such as
   applications, control plane, and data plane.  Figure 3 shows a
   reference architecture of energy-efficient management framework for
   network devices.  Applications are just described as examples so they
   are out of scope in this document.

                       framework for network devices

   According to the Section 4.2.1, the proposed framework have a
   separated structure of control plane and data plane.  Control plane
   includes application management, device topology management,
   networking management, and device energy management.  The control
   plane can be accomplished by gateway or the third party.  On the
   other hand, data plane includes mobility control support, location
   control support, power control support, and data plane support.  The
   data plane is only accomplished by network devices.

6.  Procedures of Energy-efficient Management Framework

   This section describes how to operate the energy-efficient management
   framework for devices.  The energy-efficient management framework
   have three operations, such as network initialization, on-demand
   processing, and event-driven processing.

6.1.  Initialization Processing

   Figure 4 shows how network initialization procedure is needed when
   application services are provided based on the energy-efficient
   management framework.

         (6)                     (4)
      +-------+      (3)      +-------+               +------------+
      |Network|-------------->|Control|      (1)      |Applications|
      |devices|<--------------|center |<--------------|   (Users)  |
      +-------+   (2), (5)    +-------+               +------------+

             Figure 4: Procedure for initialization processing

   (1)  A user requests required application service results to a
        control server.

   (2)  The control server creates a task and delivers the task message
        to all network devices.  The task message includes what data
        should be obtained.

   (3)  When the network devices receive the task message, they decide
        whether to participate in the task or not.  If so, they send
        their information (e.g., ID, location, remaining energy level,
        etc.) to the control server.

   (4)  After all necessary information of network devices is received
        to satisfy the task, the control server creates networking
        information, such as routing paths, links, and so on, by
        analyzing all the information of involving network devices.

   (5)  The networking information is delivered to the involving network
        devices.

   (6)  The network devices does self-configuration for data gathering
        and forwarding.

6.2.  On-demand Processing

   On-demand processing means a process to modify on-going application
   services according to demands on users as shown in Figure 5.

         (4)                     (2)
      +-------+               +-------+               +------------+
      |Network|      (3)      |Control|      (1)      |Applications|
      |devices|<--------------|center |<--------------|   (Users)  |
      +-------+               +-------+               +------------+

               Figure 5: Procedure for on-demand processing

   (1)  A user requested for modification of the requested application
        service to a control server.

   (2)  The control server evaluates which devices is related with the
        previously collected information of network devices, and the
        control server modifies the on-going task policy.

   (3)  A task modification message is delivered to only related network
        devices.

   (4)  When the network devices receive the task modification message,
        they does self-configuration again for data gathering and
        forwarding based on the modified task.

   (5)  The network devices does self-configuration for data gathering
        and forwarding.

6.3.  Event-driven Processing

   If a network device, which is involved in the on-going task, runs out
   of battery, the network device cannot participate in the task any
   more.  Likewise, event-driven processing means a process to modify
   on-going application services according to network situation changes,
   such as node failures and errors, as shown in Figure 6.

                 (1),(5)                             (3)
                +-------+            (2)          +-------+
                |Network|------------------------>|Control|
                |devices|<------------------------|center |
                +-------+            (4)          +-------+

              Figure 6: Procedure for event-driven processing

   (1)  When energy level of a network device goes to lower limit or
        moves to another place, the network device is aware of network
        situation changes.

   (2)  The network device sends a modification request message to the
        control server.

   (3)  When the control server receives the message, it evaluates which
        other devices can be instead of the failed device with the
        previously collected information of network devices, and the
        control server modifies the on-going task policy.

   (4)  A task modification message is delivered to only related network
        devices.

   (5)  When the network devices receive the task modification message,
        they does self-configuration again for data gathering and
        forwarding based on the modified task.
