Abstract

   The Future Presence extension adds elements to the Presence
   Information Data Format (PIDF) that allow a presentity to declare
   their status for a time in the future.

1. Introduction

   Presence information, e.g., represented as PIDF [3] and RPID [2],
   describes the current state of the presentity.  RPID allows to
   indicate how long certain aspects of the status have been valid and
   how long they are expected to be valid, but the time range has to
   include the time when the presence information is delivered to the
   watcher.  (This restriction is necessary to avoid
   backwards-compatibility problems with plain PIDF implementations.)

   In some cases, the watcher can better plan communications if it knows
   about the presentity's future plans.  For example, if a watcher knows
   that the presentity is about to travel, it might place a phone call
   earlier.

   It is also occasionally useful to represent past information since it
   may be the only known presence information; it may give watchers an
   indication of the current status.  For example, indicating that the
   presentity was at a meeting that ended an hour ago indicates that the
   presentity is likely in transit at the current time.

   Future status cannot be expressed with <tuples> elements with
   optional extensions since PIDF parsers would not be able to
   distinguish current from future or past information.

   This document defines the <future-status> element that describes
   status information that is either no longer valid or covers some
   future timeperiod.

2. Future-Status Element

   The <future-status> element MUST be qualified with the 'from'
   attribute and MAY be qualified with an 'until' attribute to describe
   the time when the status assumed this value and the time until which
   is element is expected to be valid. The time range MUST NOT encompass
   the present time, as that would provide an unnecessary and confusing
   alternate mechanism to describe presence.

   Note that this document chooses absolute rather than relative times,
   since relative times would be too hard to keep properly updated when
   spacing notifications, for example.  Implementors are advised to
   ascertain whether the time values in the <future-status> elements are
   plausible, for example, by checking whether the time stamp in a
   notification protocol message corresponds to local time.

3. Example

   An example combining PIDF and future-status is shown in Fig.  Figure
   1.


   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <presence xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf"
           xmlns:ts="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:future-status"
           entity="pres:someone@example.com">

        <tuple id="7c8dqui">
          <contact>sip:someone@example.com</contact>
          <status>
            <basic>open</basic>
          </status>
          <future-status from="2003-08-15T10:20:00.000-05:00"
             until="2003-08-22T19:30:00.000-05:00">
             <basic>closed</basic>
          </future-status>
        </tuple>
        <note>I'll be in Tokyo next week</note>
     </presence>

5. IANA Considerations

   This document calls for IANA to register a new XML namespace URNs per
   [4].

5.1 URN Sub-Namespace Registration for
    'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:future-status'

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:future-status

   Description: This is the XML namespace for XML elements defined by
      RFCXXXX to describe future-status presence information extensions
      for the status element in the PIDF presence document format in the
      application/cpim-pidf+xml content type.

6. Security Considerations

   The security issues are similar to those for RPID [2].
