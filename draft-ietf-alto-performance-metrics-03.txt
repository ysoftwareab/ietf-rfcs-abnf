                     ALTO Performance Cost Metrics
                 draft-ietf-alto-performance-metrics-03

Abstract

   Cost Metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic
   Optimization (ALTO).  It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the
   Endpoint Cost Service.

   Different applications may benefit from different Cost Metrics.  For
   example, a Resource Consumer may prefer Resource Providers that offer
   a low delay delivery to the Resource Consumer.  However the base ALTO
   protocol [ALTO] has documented only one single cost metric, i.e., the
   generic "routingcost" metric (Sec. 14.2 of ALTO base specification
   [ALTO]).

   This document, proposes a set of Cost Metrics, derived and aggregated
   from routing protocols with different granularity and scope, such as
   BGP-LS,OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE, or from end-to-end traffic management
   tools.  It currently documents Network Performance Cost Metrics
   reporting on network delay, jitter, packet loss, hop count, and
   bandwidth.  These metrics may be exposed by an ALTO Server to allow
   applications to determine "where" to connect based on network
   performance criteria.  Additional Cost Metrics involving ISP specific
   considerations or other network technologies may be documented in
   further versions of this draft.

   Requirements Language The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   Cost Metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic
   Optimization (ALTO).  It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the
   Endpoint Cost Service.  In particular, applications may benefit from
   knowing network performance measured on several Cost Metrics.  For
   example, a more delay-sensitive application may focus on latency, and
   a more bandwidth-sensitive application may focus on available
   bandwidth.

   This document introduces a set of new cost metrics, listed in
   Table 1, to support the aforementioned applications and allow them to
   determine "where" to connect based on network performance criteria.
   Hence, this document extends the base ALTO protocol [ALTO], which
   defines only a single cost metric, i.e., the generic "routingcost"
   metric (Sec. 14.2 of ALTO base specification [ALTO]).

   The purpose of this draft is to list the metrics likely to be exposed
   to ALTO Clients, including those already specified in other
   standardization groups and as such it does not claim novelty on all
   the specified metrics.  Some metrics may have values produced by
   standard measurement methods such as those specified in IPPM, some

   may be ISP dependent such as those registered in ISIS or OSPF-TE.  In
   this case, this document will refer to the relevant specifications.

   An ALTO server may provide a subset of the cost metrics described in
   this document.  These cost metrics can be retrieved and aggregated
   from routing protocols or other traffic measurement management tools
   (See Figure 1).  Note that these cost metrics are optional and not
   all them need to be exposed to applications.  For example, those that
   are subject to privacy concerns should not be provided to
   unauthorized ALTO clients.

                    Figure 1.End-to-End Path Cost Metrics Exposing

   When an ALTO server supports a cost metric defined in this document,
   it MUST announce this metric in its IRD.

   Additionally, future versions of this document may define network
   metric values that stem from both measurements and provider policies
   such as many metrics related to end-to-end path bandwidth.

   As for the reliability and trust in the exposed metric values,
   applications SHOULD rapidly give up using ALTO-based guidance if they
   feel the exposed information does not preserve their performance
   level or even degrades it.

   Following the ALTO base protocol, this document uses JSON to specify
   the value type of each defined metric.  See [RFC4627] for JSON data
   type specification.

2.  Challenges on data sources and computation of ALTO performance
    metrics

2.1.  Data sources Challenge

   An ALTO server needs data sources to compute the cost metrics
   described in this document.  This document does not define the exact
   data sources.  For example, the ALTO server may use log servers or
   the OAM system as its data source [ALTO-DEPLOYMENT].  In particular,
   the cost metrics defined in this document can be computed using
   routing systems as the data sources.  Mechanisms defined in
   [RFC3630], [RFC3784], [OSPF-TE], [ISIS-TE], [BGP-LS] and [BGP-PM]
   that allow an ALTO Server to retrieve and derive the necessary
   information to compute the metrics that we describe in this document.

   One challenge lies in the data sources originating the ALTO metric
   values.  The very important purpose of ALTO is to guide application
   traffic with provider network centric information that may be exposed
   to ALTO Clients in the form of network performance metric values.
   Not all of these metrics have values produced by standardized
   measurement methods or routing protocols.  Some of them involve
   provider-centric policy considerations.  Some of them may describe
   wireless or cellular networks.  To reliably guide users and
   applications while preserving provider privacy, ALTO performance
   metric values may also add abstraction to measurements or provide
   unitless performance scores.

2.2.  ALTO performance metrics Computation Challenges

   The metric values exposed by an ALTO server may result from
   additional processing on measurements from data sources to compute
   exposed metrics.  This may involve data processing tasks such as
   aggregating the results across multiple systems, removing outliers,
   and creating additional statistics.  There are two challenges on
   computation of ALTO performance metrics.

2.2.1.  Configuration Parameters Challenge

   Performance metrics often depend on configuration parameters.  For
   example, the value of packet loss rate depends on the measurement
   interval and varies over time.  To handle this issue, an ALTO server
   may collect data on time periods covering the previous and current
   time or only collect data on present time.  The ALTO server may
   further aggregate these data to provide an abstract and unified view
   that can be more useful to applications.  To make the ALTO client
   better understand how to use these performance data, the ALTO server
   may provide the client with the validity period of the exposed metric
   values.

Internet-Draft        ALTO Performance Cost Metrics        December 2017


2.2.2.  Availability of end to end path values Challenge

   Applications value information relating to bandwidth availability
   where as bandwidth related metrics can often be only measured at the
   link level.  This document specifies a set of link-level bandwidth
   related values that may be exposed as such by an ALTO server.  The
   server may also expose other metrics derived from their aggregation
   and having different levels of endpoint granularity, e.g. link
   endpoints or session endpoints.  The metric specifications may also
   expose the utilized aggregation laws.

3.  Cost Metric: POWDelay

   Metric name:

      Periodic One Way Delay


   Metric Description:

      To specify spatial and temporal aggregated delay of a stream of
      packets exchanged between the specified source and destination or
      the time that the packet spends to travel from source to
      destination.  The spatial aggregation level is specified in the
      query context (e.g., PID to PID, or endpoint to endpoint).

   Use and Applications:

      The Metric value Type is a single 'JSONNumber' type value
      containing a non-negative integer component that may be followed
      by an exponent part.  The Cost Mode is encoded as a US-ASCII
      string.

      This metric could be used as a cost metric constraint attribute
      used either together with cost metric attribute 'routingcost' or
      on its own or as a returned cost metric in the response.

8.  Traffic Engineering Performance Cost Metrics

   This section introduces ALTO network performance metrics that may be
   aggregated from network metrics measured on links and specified in
   other documents.  In particular, the bandwidth related metrics
   specified in this section are only available through link level
   measurements.  For some of these metrics, the ALTO Server may further
   expose aggregated values while specifying the aggregation laws.

9.  Security Considerations

   The properties defined in this document present no security
   considerations beyond those in Section 15 of the base ALTO
   specification [ALTO].

   However concerns addressed in Sections "15.1 Authenticity and
   Integrity of ALTO Information", "15.2 Potential Undesirable Guidance
   from Authenticated ALTO Information" and "15.3 Confidentiality of
   ALTO Information" remain of utmost importance.  Indeed, TE
   performance is a highly sensitive ISP information, therefore, sharing
   TE metric values in numerical mode requires full mutual confidence
   between the entities managing the ALTO Server and Client.  Numerical
   TE performance information will most likely be distributed by ALTO
   Servers to Clients under strict and formal mutual trust agreements.
   On the other hand, ALTO Clients must be cognizant on the risks
   attached to such information that they would have acquired outside
   formal conditions of mutual trust.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has created and now maintains the "ALTO Cost Metric Registry",
   listed in Section 14.2, Table 3 of [RFC7285].  This registry is
   located at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/alto-protocol/alto-
   protocol.xhtml#cost-metrics>.  This document requests to add the
   following entries to "ALTO Cost Meric Registry".
