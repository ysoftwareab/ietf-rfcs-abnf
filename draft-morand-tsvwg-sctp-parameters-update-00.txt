      Update of the List of Configurable SCTP Protocol Parameters
              draft-morand-tsvwg-sctp-parameters-update-00

Abstract

   In the SCTP protocol stack implementations available for deployment
   in operational networks, it has been usually observed that the list
   of parameters that can be configured by the operators is often
   restricted to the list of SCTP protocol parameter values that are
   recommended for SCTP given in the IETF RFC 4960.  However, this list
   is not exhaustive.

   This document updates the IETF RFC 4960 by including the SACK delay
   as part of the list of SCTP protocol parameters that can be
   configurable by an SCTP administrator.  The associated recommended
   value is also given, according to the IETF RFC 4960

1.  Introduction

   The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is specified in the
   IETF RFC 4960 [RFC4960], document that obsoletes IETF RFC 2960 and
   RFC 3309.  In the section 15 of IETF RFC 4960 [RFC4960], there is a
   list of SCTP protocol parameter values that are recommended.  This
   list is given below:

      RTO.Initial - 3 seconds

      RTO.Min - 1 second

      RTO.Max - 60 seconds

      Max.Burst - 4

      RTO.Alpha - 1/8

      RTO.Beta - 1/4

      Valid.Cookie.Life - 60 seconds

      Association.Max.Retrans - 10 attempts

      Path.Max.Retrans - 5 attempts (per destination address)

      Max.Init.Retransmits - 8 attempts

      HB.interval - 30 seconds

      HB.Max.Burst - 1

   In the SCTP protocol stack implementations available in the
   operational field, it has been usually observed that the list of
   parameters that can be configured by the operators is often
   restricted to the list of parameters given in the section 15 of the
   IETF RFC 4960 [RFC4960].  However, this list is not exhaustive and
   therefore, depending on the SCTP stack implementations, some
   parameters may or may not be part of the list of parameters that can
   be configured by the SCTP administrators.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses terminology defined [RFC4960].

3.  SACK Delay

   As part of the parameters that are not listed as configurable
   parameters, a specific parameter is the Selective Acknowledgement
   (SACK) delay.  In SCTP, the SACK (3) is sent to a peer endpoint to
   acknowledge received DATA chunks and to inform the peer endpoint of
   gaps in the received subsequences of DATA chunks as represented by
   their Transmission Sequence Numbers (TSNs).  This SACK should be sent
   within a maximun delay.  The following recommendation is given in the
   section 6.2 of the IETF RFC 4960 [RFC4960] "Acknowledgement on
   Reception of DATA Chunks":

      Specifically, an acknowledgement SHOULD be generated for at least
      every second packet (not every second DATA chunk) received, and
      SHOULD be generated within 200 ms of the arrival of any
      unacknowledged DATA chunk.

   Moreover, in the same section, there is the following implementation
   note:

      IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: The maximum delay for generating an
      acknowledgement may be configured by the SCTP administrator,
      either statically or dynamically, in order to meet the specific
      timing requirement of the protocol being carried.

   The following normative statement is also added:

      An implementation MUST NOT allow the maximum delay to be
      configured to be more than 500 ms.  In other words, an
      implementation MAY lower this value below 500 ms but MUST NOT
      raise it above 500 ms.

   Based on the statements given in the section 6.2 of the IETF RFC 4960
   [RFC4960], it is implied that the maximum delay for generating a SACK
   must also be configurable by the SCTP administrator.  If the
   recommended delay for sending a SACK is 200ms, this delay must not
   exceed 500ms, which leaves latitudes for the setting of the SACK
   delay value.  However, as SCTP stack implementers usually refer only
   to the section 15 of the IETF RFC 4960 [RFC4960] to identify the list
   of configurable SCTP parameters, the configuration of the maximum
   delay for generating a SACK is commonly not supported.

   It is then proposed to update the IETF RFC 4960 [RFC4960] to include
   the SCTP protocol parameter "SACK.Delay" as one of the configurable
   SCTP protocol parameters, in addition to the existing parameters
   given in the section 15 of the IETF RFC 4960 [RFC4960].

4.  List of Configurable SCTP Protocol parameters

   This document updates the IETF RFC 4960 [RFC4960] by including the
   SACK delay as part of the list of SCTP protocol parameters that MUST
   be configurable.  The updated list is given below:

      IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: The SCTP implementation may allow Upper Layer
      Protocol (ULP) to customize some of these protocol parameters (see
      Section 10 of the IETF RFC 4960 [RFC4960].

      Note: RTO.Min SHOULD be set as recommended above.
