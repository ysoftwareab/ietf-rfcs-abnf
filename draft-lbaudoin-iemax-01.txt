     Internationalized Electronic Mail Addresses in RFC5280 / X.509
                              Certificates
                        draft-lbaudoin-iemax-01

Abstract

   Specifies support for email address internationalization in RFC5280 /
   X.509 certificates.  This defines an encoding for UTF-8 characters in
   certificate Subject Alternative Names and Issuer Alternative Names
   using base64url which is backwards compatible with the IA5String
   encoding used to encode email addresses.

1.  Background

   Internationalization of email addresses has significant precedence.
   Internationalization of domain names was specified in RFC3490
   [RFC3490] and more recently in RFC5890 [RFC5890] via puny-coding of
   the unicode domain name labels.  Email address in RFC5280 [RFC5280]
   certificate Subject Alternative Name (SAN) and Issuer Alternative
   Name (IAN) support this internationalization of domain names as
   described in section 7.5.  In RFC6532 [RFC6532], email headers as
   specified in RFCRFC5321 [RFC5321] and RFCRFC5322 [RFC5322] was
   refined to support UTF-8 unicode representation which implies support
   for unicode email addresses but RFC5280 was not updated to take this
   into account.

2.  Proposal

   This draft proposes an encoding for internationalized email
   addresses.  To support the unicode local name part, this draft
   proposes a base64url encoding for the local part of the email address
   in the RFC5280 certificate SAN and IAN.  That is the encoded string
   starts with an escape character ':' to identify that the RFC5280
   email address is internationalized and encoded.  The local part of
   the email address then consists of unicode UTF-8 name that must be
   websafe base64url encoded as specifed in RFC4648 [RFC4648].  The
   escape colon character is a character intentionally choosen such that
   it is supported by IA5String but not possible in a compliant ASCII
   RFC5322 email addresses.  Support for internationalized domain names
   in the certificates is already specified in RFC5280 [RFC5280], and
   this draft does not change that interpretation.

   One potential issue for an encoded internationalized SAN or IAN email
   address is its impact on RFC5280 naming constraints particularly
   between a draft compliant certificate and a non compliant
   implementation.  This encoding will not impact name matching in this
   scenario as mismatching local part names and constraints will always

   match test negatively.  The local part should only match if the
   implementation is compliant with this draft.  Because the draft does
   not change internationalized domain name behavior, both the compliant
   and non-compliant implementation can test domain name constraints in
   the expected way.
