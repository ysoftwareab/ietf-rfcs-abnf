Abstract

   In view of the characteristics of multi-domain optical networks under
   hierarchical PCE architecture and its key management needs, a novel
   key management scheme (KMS-KI) based on key hypergraph and in this
   paper identity-based cryptography was proposed. The key relationship
   of multi-domain optical networks was firstly modeled into key
   hypergraph with two layers, namely the vertices was represented by
   points and the key relation at all levels was described with
   hyperedge. And the master keys, the public keys and private keys, the
   session keys, the layer group keys and the inter-domain keys were
   generated respectively and were dynamic managed by using hierarchical
   identity-based cryptography and improved private key generation
   strategies. When the group members join or leave, the remaining group
   members autonomously used the key value of the pPCE or cPCE to
   calculate and update the group key. So the risk that the new group
   key was uncovered by adversary was greatly reduced. KMS-KI scheme
   possessed the security performance of forward and backward,
   confidentiality of private keys and the ability of resisting
   collusive attack. Meanwhile, it not only supported the using of
   hierarchical identity-based cryptography, but also had performed
   comprehensively well in terms of numbers of the key storage, numbers
   of cPCE communication, encryption and decryption times.

Internet-Draft        Key Management Schemes                October 2017


1.  Introduction

   For the routing problem of multi-domain optical network, IETF
   proposes two different solutions based on PCE (Path Computation
   Element) architecture [1], flat PCE scheme [2] and hierarchical PCE
   scheme [3]. However, both types of PCE programmes need to address
   security threats such as high power signal crosstalk, privacy
   disclosure, denial of service, tampering, counterfeiting and
   replaying, identity counterfeiting, etc. [4,5]. Public PCE
   architecture specifically for security solutions are very few, but
   the RFC 5440 [6] and RFC 5920 [7] proposed safety countermeasures
   including authentication, encryption, digital signatures, attack
   detection, privacy protection, key management. Since all kinds of
   security strategies are inseparable from the use of keys, RFC 5440
   proposes that the large-scale multi-domain optical network under PCE
   architecture should adopt dynamic key management. Although there is
   no public key management schemes for multi-domain optical network
   based on PCE architecture, the research on group key management in
   general network environment has made great progress. Generally
   speaking, the current group key management schemes can be divided
   into three categories [8]: centralized schemes, distributed schemes
   and distributed schemes. For example, the flat type centralized
   schemes represented by GKMP [9]; The logical hierarchical centralized
   schemes represented by LKH [10] and Pour07 [11]; Distributed schemes
   represented by GDH [12]; The decentralized schemes represented by
   Iolus [13] and Saroit [14]. According to the dependent degree for the
   Group Key update to GKC (Group Key Controller), we can divide these
   schemes into three categories: those that are completely dependent on
   GKC, such as GKMP, LKH schemes, etc. Partial reliance on GKC
   programmes, such as the Pour07 programmes, Saroit solutions;
   Completely independent of GKC schemes, such as GDH distributed
   solutions. Among them, the centralized schemes can easily come up
   with single point failure due to the need for continuous work of GKC
   alone. Distributed solutions solve the centralized better in a single
   point of failure and GKC trust issues, but they need more
   communications and computation to maintain group member key
   relationship between each node; Distributed solution is a compromise
   between the centralized and distributed solutions, it divides a big
   group into several smaller subgroups, each subgroups generate the key
   by their own GKC and distribute them to other group members, which is
   suitable for large dynamic group communication. According to the
   characteristics of layered PCE multi-domain optical network, the
   decentralized and partially dependent GKC key management schemes are
   relatively reasonable, which can effectively solve the problem of
   single point failure and "1 influence". For security and efficiency,
   the current distributed solutions need to be improved if applied to
   the layered PCE architecture optical network. On the one hand, the
   current decentralized solutions are mostly based on logical key tree,

   in which an edge is used to describe the relationship between the two
   nodes, but the key relationships between the multiple nodes in the
   inter domain and the intra domain of the optical network can not be
   directly used to describe with the simple edge; On the other hand,
   the typical programmes need further improvement. Specifically, Iolus
   schemes adopt the flat structure based on group membership management
   and when the group members leave, the traffic of the subgroups GKC is
   -1 (the number of group members). Aiming at the shortcomings of the
   Iolus schemes, Saroit et al. proposes a distributed scheme based on
   members of the characteristic value (Saroit scheme), and set members'
   traffic down to 1 who leave subgroups GKC, but the dangers of the
   collusion attack enemy hidden exist. Du Xiaojiang in the PLA
   information engineering university put forward a kind of improved
   schemes based on members eigenvalues [15] (referred to as Du), the
   scheme can resist the collusion attack of child group whose
   performance is superior to the Iolus scheme,and make the traffic of
   the subgroup key manager decrease from 1 to log2 when the members of
   the child group leave. But the scheme is based on balance logical key
   tree for key management, when used in multi-domain optical networks,
   management efficiency is relatively low, and when the equilibrium
   conditions are not met, this method still need further design and
   improvement. Moreover, in the security research based on the
   hypergraph, literature [16] studies the technology of privacy
   anonymous protection based on hypergraph model, and proposes the
   related attack and anonymous model , literature [17] proposes a
   satellite network multicast key management scheme based on hypergraph
   which can be applied to large scale satellite network dynamic group
   communication and reduce the use of satellite bandwidth. However,
   since the scheme is implemented with the traditional encryption
   methods, the security costs are relatively high. Therefore, this
   article innovation land applies the hypergraph theory to multi-domain
   key management of intelligent optical network under multi-layer PCE
   architecture, and transform the traditional logical key tree to the
   new key hypergraph model. Then it adopts the identity password system
   based on hierarchy and the improved public and private key generation
   strategy, completes all kinds of key generation and dynamic
   management. With the the fusion feature value thought of members, the
   remaining group members can calculate and update the group key by
   theirselves when group members leave.

2.  Network Model and Assumptions
   
2.1  Multi-domain Optical Network Model Based on Hierarchical PCE
   
   The sample of the multi-domain optical network based on layered
   PCE [3] includes three domains, each member of the domain numbers for
   m1 to m15. At the same time, each domain is equipped with a child
   path cell cPCE (child-PCE), the whole network is configured with a
   parent paths cell pPCE (parent-PCE).

   Assume the source node is m1 and the destination node is m15. The
   specific calculation and construction path process are as follows:
   Step 1: The source node sends a inter-domain Path calculation request
   message to the child PCE (cPCE-1) in this domain as the PCC (Path
   Computation Client), and then cPCE-1 transponds the request to the
   parent PCE (pPCE).
   Step 2: After receiving the requests, firstly the father PCE confirms
   the domain where the destination node is, and then calculates a
   abstract routing from the source to destination node and sends the
   request to calculate paths to the relevant child PCE, which asks the
   child PCE combines to calculate the path segment from the source node
   to the boundary node, from boundary node to the boundary node, from
   the boundary node to thedestination node.
   Step 3: After receiving the calculation results from the path of the
   related child PCE, firstly the father PCE merges the path segments
   into several end-to-end inter-domain paths, and then selects the
   optimal path to satisfy the constraints as the final results. Finally
   the result is sent to the child PCE1.
   Step 4: The child PCE1 receives the calculation of the path
   information from the father PCE and sends the calculated path
   information to PCC, namely it completes the calculation of the
   inter-domain path.
   Step 5: The source node enable the RSVP - TE or CR - LDP signaling
   protocols to build routes , namely completes the collection and
   distribution of the resources like the available wavelength, so as to
   ensure the whole end-to-end optical path to establish successful. If
   it fails, the light connection request will be blocked.
   
2.2  Hypergraph Theory

   In 1973, the concept of hypergraphs was proposed by c.b. erge [18],
   and the undirected hypergraph theory was created for the first time.
   With the development of research, the hypergraph theory has a wide
   application in the field of the operations research and network
   communication [19]. The general mathematical definition of the
   supergraph is given below:
   Definition 1: Let H=(V,E) , where V is a set of all nodes, E is a
   hyperedge set of the node in V , where the edge connecting two
   vertices is a special case of the hyperedge set , namely H=(V,E)
   is called hypergraph.

2.3  Hierarchical Identity Cryptosystem

   The cryptosystem certificate management structure based on public key
   Infrastructure PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is complex and costs
   too much, so Shamir proposed the thought of the IBC cryptosystem
   based on the Identity (Identity-Based Cryptosystem) [20] in 1984.

Internet-Draft         Key Management Schemes               October 2017


   Since then, the Identity-Based Encryption schemes and the
   Identity-Based Signature schemes have been proposed with the bilinear
   pairs. Due to the problems of IBC schemes based on a single Private
   Key generation center PKG (Private Key Generator) that single point
   failure affects the overall situation exists, the layered IBC schemes
   has attracted the public attention [21], namely the introduction of
   sub-layer PKG to share the key management tasks for the root node
   PKG, each PKG only computes the private key for the user under its
   subnodes. To a certain extent,it reduces the risk of the system. The
   introduction to the definition of the bilinear pairings and its
   properties are as below.
   Definition 2: bilinear pair. G1 is the addition cycle group of q
   order, G2 is the multiplication cycle group of q order, where q is a
   large prime number, e:G1XG1->G2 is a bilinear pair mapping, and the
   following properties are satisfied below :
                                                                *   *
   (1) Double line: For random A,B belong to G1,a,b belong to Z , Z  is  
                                                                q   q
   the integer multiplication group model q , e(aA,bB)=e(A,B)^ab ;  				           
   (2) Non-degeneracy: For the existence of A,B belong to G1,e(A,B)NEQ1;
   (3) Computability: For random A,B belong to G1, the computable
   algorithms for e(A,B) exist.

3.  Multi-domain Optical Network Key Hypergraph Model
   
   This paper for the first time apply the hypergraph theory into
   multi-domain optical networks key management model, modeling the
   relationship between the keys into two layers of key hypergraph,
   namely the vertexes are expressed by the point, with super edge to
   describe the relationship between the key at each layers, to make the
   key hierarchical relationships in the network can be better reflected
   in the key hypergraph model.
   Definition 3: Multi-domain optical network key hypergraph.
   Multi-domain key light hypergraph model is defined as a hierarchical
   key hypergraph G=(M,E), where M=(mo,m2,...,m(n-1)),
   E=(E0(K0),...,Ed(Kd),eo(k0),...,et(K(t-1))) , while |Ei|>=1, |d|
   represents the total number of autonomous domain, |t| respresents the
   total number of edges connecting two different domains vertex, Kiorki
   respresents group keys of the nodes covered by Eiorei . The whole key
   supergraph is divided into two layers, namely PCE layer and
   autonomous domain layer. In PCE layer, pPCE is PKG or KGC of cPCE,
   cPCE is PKG or KGC of various autonomous domain. 

4.  Key Management Scheme KMS-KI

   Fusion of the improved private key generation strategy and the key
   update ideas based on the eigenvalue of members, this paper proposes
   a key management scheme for multi-domain optical network based on key
   hypergraph and identity key, that is KMS-KI(Key Management Scheme
   based on Key hypergraph and Identity cryptosystem in multi-domain
   optical Networks).

4.2  The Design of the KMS-KI

   KMS-KI is divided into PCE layer and autonomous domain layer. This
   paper takes the two layers into uniform description centre on the
   main process of key management, including key establishment, group
   key update when members join, and group key update when members
   exit.

4.2.1  Key Establishment

   (1) The establishment of the public-private key
   a. The establishment of the public-private key of the pPCE
   As pPCE is the PKG of PCE layer, firstly, with the parameters
   generator, we input system big prime q and security parameters kq,
   output G1,G2ande, select a generated cell g and hash function
   h:{0,1}*->G1, randomly select ks belong to Z*q as master key of PKG 
   system, set the private key of pPCE RpPCE=ks, the public key of pPCE
   PpPCE=ksg, generat the public parameters of the system cipher suite
   A=(G1,G2,q,g,PpPCE,h).
   b. The establishment of the public-private key of the cPCE
   Step 1: Initialization.
   The preset parameter A is opened Offline to cPCEi, then cPCEi
   generates identity label IDi=dig as its public key PcPCE(i), and
   calculates the session key agreement required parameters X=gdimodq,
   where disystem,Z*q, g as the generated cell and make IDi and 
   corresponding user passphrase preseted in pPCE.
   Step 2:  cPCEi->pPCE:[Request Key,IDi,W,X]PpPCE. Namely ask pPCE to
   generate some private key information for itself and encrypt this
   message with the public key of pPCE.
   Step 3: After decrypting the requested message with the private key
   and verifying the authenticity of the user cPCEi, pPCE calculates the
   partial private key information ksh(IDi) of cPCEi, and select the
                              *
   random number p belong to Z , calculate the parameters for the 
                              q
                              p
   session key negotiation Y=g mod q;
   Step4: pPCE->cPCEi:[ksh(IDi),[Y]PcPCE]RpPCE;
   Step5: After verifying the authenticity of its signature with the
   pPCE public key, then cPCEi calculates its complete private key
   RcPCE(i)=diksh(IDi) and decryptes [Y]PcPCE  with the private key.
   c. The establishment of the public-private key of intra-doamin nodes
   In the autonomous domain layer, because pPCE needs to complete the
   path calculation unit of centralized management in the domain,so this
   paper selects pPCE as the PKG in this domain to complete key

   (2) The establishment of the session key
   a. The establishment of the session key of the PCE layer
   Step 1: pPCE adopts the Diffie-Hellman algorithm for the session key
                                                         i    p
   negotiation with single cPCEi,namely pPCE calculates k   =X mod q,
                                                         p-c
                     i    di
   cPCEi calculates k   =Y  mod q. According to the Diffie-Hellman
                     c-p 
		         i    i
   algorithm principle, k   =k   .
                         p-c  c-p
   Step 2: The session key between cPCEi and cPCEj adopts the character
   of the identity cryptography bisexuality to generate, cPCEi
               i-j
   calculates k   =e(R       ,IDjh(IDj)), and cPCEj calculates
               c-c    cPCE(i)   
    j-i                                                       i-j  j-i
   k   =e(IDih(IDi),R       ). According to the disexuality, k   =k   .
    c-c              cPCE(j)                                  c-c  c-c
   b. The establishment of the session key in autonomous domain layer
   In autonomous domain layer, the process of session key agreement
   between the intra-domain nodes and cPCE is the same as the session
   key negotiation process between the cPCE and pPCE in the PCE layer.
   The session key negotiation process between nodes in intra-domain
   and inter-domain is the same as that between cPCE and cPCE. The key
   here only describes the session key negotiation process between the
   domain boundary nodes. Assuming that the nodes in the domain A and
   domain B have the key hyperedge, the steps of session key negotiation
   are as follows:
   Step 1: Initialization. The domain A node mi calculates X=g^x mod q, 
   in which X belong to Z*q , g is the generating cell for the large  
   prime. The domain B node mj calculates Y=g^y mod q, where Y belongs 
   to Z*q.
   Step 2: mi->cPCE :[X,B-mj] A  ,where B-mj means that the message 
                  A          k
			      m-c
   needs to be forwarded to the nodes mj in the domain B.
   Step 3: cPCE ->cPCE :[X,B-mj] A-B. After decrypting the message, 
              A      B         k   
                                c-c
                                   A-B
   cPCE  encrypts the session key k   shared with cPCEB.
       A                           c-c
   Step 4: cPCE ->mj:[X,B-mj] j  . After decrypting the message, 
              B             k    
                             c-m
                                  j
   cPCE encrypts the session key k    shared with mj.
       B                          c-m

   Step 5: After the nodes mj in the domain B decrypts this message and
   calculates the k(j-i)=X^y modq, the encryption Y is passed to the
   nodes mi in the domain A in the reverse order of step2-step4.
   Step 6: After the nodes mj in the domain A have received Y
   successfully , we calculate k(i-j)=Y^x modq. According to
   the Diffie-Hellman principle, k(i-j)=k(j-i).
   Step 7: cPCEA generate the key hyperedge of the inter-domain
   e   (k   ).
    i-j  i-j
   (3) The establishment of the layer group key
   a. The establishment of the layer group key of the PCE layer
   Step 1: pPCE generates a group key of PCE layer
                                                       *
   K0=h(r||cPCE1||...||cPCEd||pPCE), where r belongs to Z  represents  
                                                       q
   random number, cPCEi represents the number of the domain that cPCE is 
   in, d represents the total number of the autonomous domains, and then
   generates the hyperedge E0(K0) in the key hypergraph.
   Step 2: pPCE->cPCEi:[K0] i  , where i belongs to [1,d].
                           k   
			    p-c
			                          i
   Step 3: cPCEi get the layer group key K0 with k    decryption.
                                                  c-p
   b. The establishment of the group key in autonomous domain layer
   Step 1: cPCEi generates the group key of autonomous domain layer
                                                   *
   Ki=h(r||ms||...||me||cPCEi) , where r belongs to Z  represents the  
                                                   q
   random number, ms and me represent respectively the starting and 
   ending numbers of the nodes in the domain and then generates the 
   hyperedge Ei(Ki) in the key hypergraph.
   Step 2: cPCE->{ms-me}:[Ki] i  , where i belongs to [1,d].
                             k    
			      c-m
			                                  i
   Step 3: ms-me get the group key Ki in its domain with k   decryption.

4.2.2  Group Key Update When Members Join

   (1) The group key update when new cPCE joins
   When the new cPCE needs to be added, the public-private key of the
   new cPCE members is established, and the negotiation process of the
   session key between pPCE and cPCE is shown in section 4.2.1. However,
   the group keys for the PCE layer need to be updated for later
   security considerations.In order to simplify the update process, this
   paper adopts the basic idea of the characteristic value of [11, 15],
   namely when new PCE members join, according to the characteristic

   values of key update transferred by pPCE , and the residual PCE group
   members can calculate and replace new keys. Specific process is as
   followed:

   Step 1: New member cPCEd->pPCE, applies for the hyperedge E0(K0).
                                                           *
   Step 2: pPCE generates new random numbers r belongs to Z , and  
                                                           q
   calculaes K0'=h(K0||r||IDd) as the new group key and update hyperedge 
   E0(K0) as E0(K0').
   Step 3: pPCE=>{E(K0)-pPCE}:[r,IDd]K0 , where r,IDd are the key
   updates characteristic value for pPCE.
   Step 4: pPCE->PCEd:[K0'] d  .
                           k    
			    p-c
   Step 5: After each cPCEi(i NEQ d) decrypts the message with the group
   key, they calculate K0'=h(K0||r||IDd) as the new group key.
   Step 6: cPCEd gets new group key K0' with the decryption of the
   shared session key with pPCE.
   (2) The group key update when new node joins in autonomous domain
   In autonomous domain layer, when there is a need to add a new node,
   you need to update key hyperedge Ei(Ki), among them 1<=i<=d, d
   respresents the number of the autonomousdomains. The group key update
   process and the key updating process when new cPCE joins are the
   same, which is illustrated in Figure 1. when a new node requests to
   join the autonomous domain 3 where cPCE3 is in, its group key update
   process is as followed:

                                  E0(K0)                            |

   Step 1:  New node m19->cPCE3, applies to join hyperedgeE3(K3). Then,
   m19 using the method described in section 4.2.1 to generate the
   public-private key, and the session key is negotiated with the
   original nodes m11-m15 with cPCE3(m18).

   E3(K3) to E3(K3').
   Step 3: cPCE3=>{m11-m15}:[r,ID19]k3.

   shared session key with cPCE3.
                           
4.2.3  Group Key Update When Members Join

   (1) The group key update when the cPCE exits
   When a cPCE member needs to exit, the group key of PCE layer needs to
   be updated for the security consideration. The specific process is as
   follows:
   Step 1: Member cPCEk->pPCE, applies to exit hyperedge E0(K0).
   Step 2: Update hyperedge E0(K0) to E0(K0'),and
                                                             *
   pPCE->{E(K0)-cPCEk-pPCE}:[r,IDk] i   ,where r belongs to Z .
                                   k                         q
				    p-c
   Step 3: After each cPCEi(i NEQ k) degrypts the message with the 
   session key shared with pPCE, calculates separately K0'=h(K0||r||IDk) 
   as the new group key.
   (2) The group key update when the members in autonomous domain exits
   The group key update process of the members exit in the autonomous
   domain is basically similar to that of cPCE in PCE layer. But it also
   requires the destruction of session keys between domain boundaries.
   The specific process is as follows:
   Step 1: member mk->cPCEi, apply to exit the hyperedge Ei(Ki),firstly,
   cPCEi judges if the mk is the boundary nodes,execute step2,or step5.
   Step 2:cPCEi=>cPCEj:[mk]k, namely ask cPCEj to inform intra-domain
   nodes related to mk and to destroy the session key between the 
   boundary nodes.
   Step 3: After decrypting the message, cPCEj=>{E(kj)-cPCEj}:[mk]k,
   namely ask ralated nodes in the domain to destroy the session key
   with mk.
   Step 4: After the related nodes in the domain where cPCEj is, destroy
   the session key relevant with mk.
   Step 5: cPCE->{E(Ki)-cPCEi-mk}:[r,IDk]ki, cPCEi updates the hyperedge
                                          *
   Ei(Ki) to Ei(Ki'), where r belongs to Z  .
                                          q

   Step 6: After the other member mi(i NEQ k) decrypting the session key
   shared with cPCEi, each calculates Ki'=h(Ki||r||IDk) as the group
   key.

5.  Conclusions and Future Work

   In this research, because of the huge amount of network traffic, the
   security issue has attracted the attention of the industry.For the
   security threats such as high power signal crosstalk, privacy leaks,
   denial of service, message tampering, forgery and replay, identity of
   fake,all kinds of security solutions require the use of multiple
   security protection measures such as encryption, authentication,
   digital signature, attack detection and privacy protection and the
   security mechanisms can not do without the use of keys, so the
   effective key management is an important issue in optical networks.
   Aiming at this problem, based on the PCE framework of multi-domain
   optical network as the research object, this paper proposes a new key
   management scheme (KMS-KI) based on hypergraph theory and identity
   of cryptographic.The scheme with the ability of the forward security,
   the backward security and anti-collusion attack, and compared the
   typical distributed scheme based on the logical key tree, while 
   supporting hierarchical identity-based cryptosystem, the key storage
   and cPCE traffic and the number of encryption has obtained a better
   comprehensive performance. Next, the research will focus on how to
   integrate key management and credit management to improve the
   security of multi-domain optical network.

   schemes in multi-domain optical networks, and the scheme considers
   the security performance of forward and backward, confidentiality of
   private keys and the ability of resisting collusive attack.
