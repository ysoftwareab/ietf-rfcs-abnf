1.  Introduction

   In TCP/IP, routing and forwarding are based on IP addresses.  To
   determine the route to an IP address and to measure the transit
   delays, the traceroute utility is used.  In ICN, routing and
   forwarding are based on name prefixes.  To this end, the problem of
   determining the characteristics (i.e., transit forwarders and delays)
   of, at least, one of the available routes to a name prefix is
   fundamendal.

   This document proposes protocol mechanisms for a traceroute
   equivalent in ICN networks.  This document contains two appendix
   sections: 1) A non-normative appendix section suggesting useful
   properties for an ICN traceroute client application that originates
   traceroute requests and processes traceroute replies and 2) An
   appendix section summarizing the open questions of the current
   protocol design.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Background on IP-Based Traceroute Operation

   In IP-based networks, traceroute is based on the expiration of the
   Time To Live (TTL) IP header field.  Specifically, a traceroute
   client sends consecutive packets (depending on the implementation and
   the user-specified behavior such packets can be either UDP datagrams,
   ICMP Echo Request or TCP SYN packets) with a TTL value increased by
   1, essentially, performing a expanding ring search.  In this way, the
   first IP packet sent will expire at the first router along the path,
   the second IP packet at the second router along the path, etc, until
   the router with the specified destination IP address is reached.
   Each router along the path towards the destination will respond by
   sending back an ICMP Time Exceeded packet.

   The IP-based traceroute utility operates on IP addresses, and in
   particular depends on the IP packets having source IP addresses that
   are used as the destination address for replies.  Given that ICN
   forwards based on names rather than destination IP addresses, that
   the names do not refer to unique endpoints (multi-destination), and
   that the packets do not contain source addresses, a different
   approach is clearly needed.

3.  Traceroute Functionality Challenges and Opportunities in ICN

   In NDN and CCN protocols, the communication paradigm is based
   exclusively on named objects.  An Interest is forwarded across the
   network based on its name.  Eventually, it retrieves a content object
   either from a producer application or some forwarder's Content Store
   (CS).

   An ICN network differs from an IP network in at least 4 important
   ways:

   o  IP identifies interfaces to an IP network with a fixed-length
      number, and delivers IP packets to one or more interfaces.  ICN
      identifies units of data in the network with a variable length
      name consisting of a list of components.

   o  An IP-based network depends on the IP packets having source IP
      addresses that are used as the destination address for replies.
      On the other hand, ICN Interests do not have source addresses and
      they are forwarded based on names, which do not refer to a unique

      end-point.  Data packets follow the reverse path of the Interests
      based on hop-by-hop state created during Interest forwarding.

   o  An IP network supports multi-path, single destination, stateless
      packet forwarding and delivery via unicast, a limited form of
      multi-destination selected delivery with anycast, and group-based
      multi-destination delivery via multicast.  In contrast, ICN
      supports multi-path and multi-destination stateful Interest
      forwarding and multi-destination data delivery to units of named
      data.  This single forwarding semantic subsumes the functions of
      unicast, anycast, and multicast.  As a result, consecutive (or
      retransmitted) ICN Interest messages may be forwarded through an
      ICN network along different paths, and may be forwarded to
      different data sources (e.g., end-node applications, in-network
      storage) holding a copy of the requested unit of data.  The
      property of discovering multiple available (or potentially all)
      paths towards a name prefix may be desirable for an ICN traceroute
      protocol, since it can be beneficial for congestion control
      purposes.  Knowing the number of available paths for a name can
      also be useful in cases that Interest forwarding based on
      application semantics/preferences is desirable.

   o  In the case of multiple Interests with the same name arriving at a
      forwarder, a number of Interests may be aggregated in a common
      Pending Interest Table (PIT) entry.  Depending on the lifetime of
      a PIT entry, the round-trip time an Interest-Data exchange might
      significantly vary (e.g., it might be shorter than the full round-
      trip time to reach the original content producer).  To this end,
      the round-trip time experienced by consumers might also vary.

   These differences introduce new challenges, new opportunities and new
   requirements in the design of ICN traceroute.  Following this
   communication model, a traceroute client should be able to express
   traceroute requests with some name prefix and receive responses.

   Our goals are the following:

   o  Trace one or more paths towards an ICN forwarder (for
      troubleshooting purposes).

   o  Trace one or more paths along which an application can be reached
      in the sense that Interest packets can be forwarded towards it.

   o  Test whether a specific named object is cached in some on-path CS,
      and, if so, trace the path towards it and return the corresponding
      forwarder.

   o  Perform transit delay network measurements.

   To this end, a traceroute target name can represent:

   o  An administrative name that has been assigned to a forwarder.
      Assigning a name to a forwarder requires a management application
      running locally, which handles Operations, Administration and
      Management (OAM) operations.

   o  A name that includes an application's namespace as a prefix.

   o  A named object that might reside in some in-network storage.

   In order to provide stable and reliable diagnostics, it is desirable
   that the packet encoding of a traceroute request enables the
   forwarders to distinguish this request from a normal Interest, while
   also allowing for forwarding behavior to be as similar as possible to
   that of an Interest packet.  In the same way, the encoding of a
   traceroute reply should allow for processing similar to that of a
   data packet by the forwarders.

   The term "traceroute session" is used for an iterative process during
   which an endpoint client application generates a number of traceroute
   requests to successively traverse more distant hops in the path until
   it receives a final traceroute reply from a forwarder.  It may be
   desirable that ICN traceroute is able to discover a number of paths
   towards the expressed prefix within the same session or subsequent
   sessions.  To discover all the hops in a path, we need a mechanism
   (Interest Steering) to steer requests along different paths.

   It is also important, in the case of traceroute requests for the same
   prefix from different sources, to have a mechanism to avoid
   aggregating those requests in the PIT.  To this end, we need some
   encoding in the traceroute requests to make each request for a common
   prefix unique, and hence avoid PIT aggregation and further enabling
   the exact matching of a response with a particular traceroute packet.

   The packet types and format are presented in Section 4.  The
   procedures, e.g. the procedures for determining and indicating that a
   destination has been reached, are specified in Section 6.

4.  ICN Traceroute CCNx Packet Format

   In this section, we present the CCNx packet format [CCNMessages] of
   ICN traceroute, where messages exist within outermost containments
   (packets).  Specifically, we propose two types of traceroute packets,
   a traceroute request and a reply packet type.

                   Traceroute Request CCNx Packet Format

   The existing packet header fields have similar functionality to the
   header fields of a CCNx Interest packet.  The value of the packet
   type field is TrRequest.  The exact numeric value of this field type
   is to be determined.

   Compared to the typical format of a CCNx packet header [CCNMessages],
   there is a new optional fixed header TLV added to the packet header:

   o  A Path Steering hop-by-hop header TLV, which is constructed hop-
      by-hop in the traceroute reply and included in the traceroute
      request to steer consecutive requests expressed by a client
      towards a common or different forwarding paths.  An example of
      such a scheme is presented in [LIPSIN].

                     Traceroute Request Message Format

   The traceroute request message is of type Interest in order to
   leverage the Interest forwarding behavior provided by the network.
   The Name TLV has the structure described in [CCNMessages].  The name
   consists of the target (destination) prefix appended with a nonce
   typed name component as its last component (to avoid Interest
   aggregation and allow exact matching of requests with responses) The
   value of this TLV will be a 64-bit nonce.

   The header of a traceroute reply consists of the header fields of a
   CCNx Content Object and a hop-by-hop path steering TLV.  The value of
   the packet type field is TrReply.  The exact numeric value of this
   field type is to be determined.

   A traceroute reply message is of type Content Object, contains a Name
   TLV (name of the corresponding traceroute request), a PayloadType TLV
   and an ExpiryTime TLV with a value of 0 to indicate that replies must
   not be cached by the network.

   o  2: Indicates that the target name matched a prefix served by an
      application (other than the internal management application of a
      forwarder).

   o  3: Indicates that the target name matched the name of an object in
      a forwarder's CS.

   o  4: Indicates that the the Hop limit reached the 0 value.

                             TrReply Code TLV

5.  ICN Traceroute NDN Packet Format

   In this section, we present the ICN traceroute Request and Reply
   Format according to the NDN packet specification [NDNTLV].

5.1.  ICN Traceroute Request NDN Packet Format

   A traceroute request is encoded as an NDN Interest packet.  Its
   format is the following:

           TracerouteRequest ::= INTEREST-TYPE TLV-LENGTH
                             Name
                             MustBeFresh
                             Nonce
                             HopLimit TLV
                             PathSteering TLV?

                   Traceroute Request NDN Packet Format

   The name of a request consists of the target name, a nonce value (it
   can be the value of the Nonce field) and the suffix "traceroute" to
   denote that this Interest is a traceroute request.

   A traceroute request contains 2 new fields.  The first one is an
   optional field for the hop-by-hop PathSteering TLV.  The format of
   this field is the following:

           PathSteering TLV ::= PATHSTEERING-TLV-TYPE TLV-LENGTH BYTE{8}

                             PathSteering TLV





Mastorakis, et al.     Expires September 28, 2017              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft               ICN Traceroute                   March 2017


   The second new field represents the HopLimit.  The value of this
   field is decremented when the request is received by each next-hop
   forwarder.  When its value reaches 0, the forwarder has to discard
   the request.  The format of this request is the following:

           HopLimit TLV ::= HOPLIMIT-TLV-TYPE TLV-LENGTH BYTE{1}

                               HopLimit TLV

   Since the NDN packet format does provide a mechanism to prevent the
   network from caching specific data packets, we will use the
   MustBeFresh selector for requests (in combination with a Freshness
   Period TLV of value 0 for replies) to avoid fetching cached
   traceroute replies.

5.2.  Traceroute Reply NDN Packet Format

   A traceroute reply is encoded as an NDN Data packet.  Its format is
   the following:

           TracerouteReply ::= DATA-TLV TLV-LENGTH
                           PathSteering TLV
                           Name
                           MetaInfo
                           Content
                           Signature

                    Traceroute Reply NDN Packet Format

   Compared to the format of a regular NDN Data packet, a traceroute
   reply contains a PathSteering TLV field, which is not included in the
   security envelope, since it might be modified in a hop-by-hop fashion
   by the forwarders along the reverse path.

   The name of a traceroute reply is the name of the corresponding
   traceroute request, while the format of the MetaInfo field is the
   following:

         MetaInfo ::= META-INFO-TYPE TLV-LENGTH
                  ContentType
                  FreshnessPeriod

                               MetaInfo TLV

   The value of the ContentType TLV is 0.  The same applies to the value
   of the FreshnessPeriod TLV, so that the replies are treated as stale
   data as soon as they are received by a forwarder.

Internet-Draft               ICN Traceroute                   March 2017


   The content of a traceroute reply consists of the following 2 TLVs:
   Sender's name (an NDN Name TLV) and Traceroute Reply Code.  There is
   no need to have a separate TLV for the sender's signature in the
   content of the reply, since every NDN data packet carries the
   signature of the data producer.

   The Traceroute Reply Code TLV format is the following (with the
   values specified in Section 4.2):

           TrReplyCode ::= TRREPLYCODE-TLV-TYPE TLV-LENGTH BYTE{2}

                         Traceroute Reply Code TLV

6.  Forwarder Handling

   When a forwarder receives a traceroute request, the hop limit value
   will be checked and decremented and the target name (i.e, the name of
   the traceroute request without the last nonce name component and the
   suffix "traceroute" in the case of a request with the NDN packet
   format) will be extracted.

   If the HopLimit value is not expired (has not reached 0), the
   forwarder will forward the request upstream based on CS lookup, PIT
   creation, LPM lookup and the path steering value, if present.  If no
   valid next-hop is found, an InterestReturn in the case of CCNx and a
   network NACK in the case of NDN is sent downstream.

   If the HopLimit value is equal to zero, the forwarder will generate a
   traceroute reply.  This reply will include the forwarder's own name
   and signature, and a PathSteering TLV.  This TLV initially has a null
   value since the traceroute reply originator does not forward the
   request and, thus, does not make a path choice.  The reply will also
   include the appropriate TrReply Code TLV.

   A traceroute reply will be the final reply of a traceroute session if
   one of the following conditions are met:

   o  Assuming that a forwarder has been given one or more
      administrative names, the target name matches one of them.

   o  The target name exactly matches the name of a content-object
      residing in the forwarder's CS (unless the traceroute client
      application has chosen not to receive replies due to CS hits as
      specified in Appendix A).

   o  The target name matches (in a Longest Prefix Match manner) a FIB
      entry with an outgoing face referring to a local application.

Internet-Draft               ICN Traceroute                   March 2017


   The TrReply Code TLV value of the reply will indicate the specific
   condition that was met.  If none of those conditions was met, the
   TrReply Code will be 4 to indicate that the hop limit value reached
   0.

   A received traceroute reply will be matched to an existing PIT entry
   as usual.  On the reverse path, the path steering TLV of a reply will
   be updated by each forwarder to encode its choice of next-hop(s).
   When included in subsequent requests, this path steering TLV will
   allow the forwarders to steer the requests along the same path.

7.  Protocol Operation For Locally-Scoped Namespaces

   In this section, we elaborate on 2 alternative design approaches in
   cases that the traceroute target prefix corresponds to a locally-
   scoped namespace not directly routable from the client's local
   network.

   The first approach leverages the NDN Link Object [SNAMP].
   Specifically, the traceroute client attaches to the expressed request
   a LINK Object that contains a number of routable name prefixes, based
   on which the request can be forwarded across the Internet until it
   reaches a network region, where the request name itself is routable.
   A LINK Object is created and signed by a data producer allowed to
   publish data under a locally-scoped namespace.  The way that a client
   retrieves a LINK Object has to do with the overall network
   architecture design and is out of the scope of the current draft.

   Based on the current deployment of the LINK Object by the NDN team, a
   forwarder at the boarder of the region, where an Interest name
   becomes routable has to remove the LINK Object from the incoming
   Interests.  The Interest state maintained along the entire forwarding
   path is based on the Interest name regardless of whether it was
   forwarded based on this name or a prefix in the LINK Object.

   The second approach is based on prepending a routable prefix to the
   locally-scoped name.  The resulting prefix will be the name of the
   requests expressed by the client.  In this way, a request will be
   forwarded across the Internet based on the routable part of its name.
   When it reaches the network region, where the original locally-scoped
   name is routable, the boarder forwarder will have to rewrite the
   request name and delete its routable part.  There are two conditions
   for a forwarder to perform this rewriting operation on a request: 1)
   the routable part of the request name matches a routable name of the
   network region adjacent to the forwarder (assuming that a forwarder
   is aware of those names) and 2) the remaining part of the request
   name is routable across the network region of this forwarder.




Mastorakis, et al.     Expires September 28, 2017              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft               ICN Traceroute                   March 2017


   The state maintained along the path, where the locally-scoped name is
   not routable, is based on the routable prefix along with the locally-
   scoped prefix, while within the network region that the locally-
   scoped prefix is routable is based only on it.  To ensure that the
   generated replies will reach the client, the boarder forwarder has
   also to rewrite the name of a reply and prepend the routable prefix
   of the corresponding request.

8.  Security Considerations

   Reflection attack concerns can arise when a compromised forwarder
   generates a traceroute reply.  In such cases, the compromised
   forwarder can attach the name of a victim forwarder to the reply
   payload to redirect future administrative traffic towards the victim.
   To mitigate these attack scenarios, the forwarder that generates a
   reply has to sign the name TLV contained in the reply message.  When
   the client receives a traceroute reply, it will be able to verify
   that the key that signed the name in the reply message can be trusted
   for both the traceroute prefix and the name of the forwarder that
   generated the reply.  Instead of including a raw name TLV and a
   signature in the reply message, the forwarder can include its
   routable prefix(es) encoded as a signed NDN Link Object [SNAMP].
   Each forwarder can generate the signature of its own name or its LINK
   Object in the beginning of its operation instead of doing so during
   the generation of each individual reply.

   This approach does not protect against on-path attacks, where a
   compromised forwarder that receives a traceroute reply replaces the
   forwarder's name and the signature in the message with its own name
   and signature to make the client believe that the reply was generated
   by the compromised forwarder.  To mitigate such attack scenarios, a
   forwarder can sign the reply message itself.  In such cases, the
   forwarder does not have to sign its own name in reply message, since
   the message signature protects the message as a whole and will be
   invalidated in the case of an on-path attack.

   Signing each traceroute reply message can be expensive and can
   potentially lead to computation attacks against forwarders.  To
   mitigate such attack scenarios, the processing of traceroute requests
   and the generation of the replies can be handled by a separate
   management application running locally on each forwarder.  Serving
   traceroute replies is a load on the forwarder.  The approaches used
   by ICN applications to manage load may also apply to the forwarder's
   management application.

   Interest flooding attack amplification is possible in the case of the
   second approach to deal with locally-scoped namespaces described in
   Section 7.  A boarder forwarder will have to maintain extra state to

   prepend the correct routable prefix to the name of an outgoing reply,
   since the forwarder might be attached to multiple network regions
   (reachable under different prefixes) or a network region attached to
   this forwarder might be reachable under multiple routable prefixes.

   We should also note that traceroute requests have the same privacy
   characteristics as regular Interests.

Appendix A.  Traceroute Client Application (Consumer) Operation

   This section is an informative appendix regarding the proposed
   traceroute client operation.

   The client application is responsible for generating traceroute
   requests for prefixes provided by users.

   The overall process can be iterative: The first traceroute request of
   each session will have a HopLimit of value 1 to reach the first hop
   forwarder, the second of value 2 to reach the second hop forwarder
   and so on and so forth.

   When generating a series of requests for a specific name, the first
   one will typically not include a PathSteering TLV, since no TLV value
   is known.  After a traceroute reply containing a PathSteering TLV is
   received, each subsequent request might include the received path
   steering value in the PathSteering header TLV to drive the requests
   towards a common path as part of checking the network performance.
   To discover more paths, a client can omit the PathSteering TLV in
   future requests.  Moreover, for each new traceroute request, the
   client has to generate a new nonce and record the time that the
   request was expressed.  It will also set the lifetime of a request,
   which will have semantics similar to the lifetime of an Interest.

   Moreover, the client application might like not to receive replies
   due to CS hits.  In CCNx, a mechanism to achieve that would be to use
   a Content Object Hash Restriction TLV with a value of 0 in the
   payload of a traceroute request message.  In NDN, the exclude filter
   selector can be used.

   When it receives a traceroute reply, the client would typically match
   the reply to a sent request and compute the round-trip time of the
   request.  It should parse the PathSteering value and decode the
   reply's payload to parse the the sender's name and signature.  The
   client should verify that both the received message and the
   forwarder's name have been signed by the key of the forwarder, whose
   name is included in the payload of the reply (by fetching this
   forwarder's public key and verifying the contained signature).  In
   the case that the client receives an TrReply Code TLV with a valid
   value, it can stop sending requests with increasing HopLimit values
   and potentially start a new traceroute session.

   In the case that a traceroute reply is not received for a request
   within a certain time interval (lifetime of the request), the client
   should time-out and send a new request with a new nonce value up to a
   maximum number of requests to be sent specified by the user.

Appendix B.  Open Design Questions

   In this section, we describe the open questions of our ICN traceroute
   protocol design.

   The current design can steer subsequent traceroute requests along the
   same forwarding path (single-path traceroute).  It can also
   opportunistically forward subsequent requests along different paths
   if the client does not attach a PathSteering TLV to the requests
   letting the network decide how to forward them.  However, one of the
   objectives of ICN traceroute, as stated in Section 3, is to discover
   a specific number of available paths and steer requests along them in
   a deterministic manner (multi-path traceroute).  The open question is

   how the ICN multi-path traceroute client could keep track of the
   multiple available paths and iteratively traverse them by using
   distinct PathSteering TLVs.

   In the previous appendix section, we mentioned the mechanism in CCNx
   and NDN that a traceroute client can use in order to avoid receiving
   replies due to CS hits (bypass the caches along the path).  If, in
   the future, a specific Interest cache control mechanism to bypass
   caches is added to the CCNx and NDN protocol specification, this
   mechanism can be used by the ICN traceroute clients as well.
