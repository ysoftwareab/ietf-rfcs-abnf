1. Introduction

   Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) describes a method for
   operating a Traffic Engineered (TE) network (such as an MPLS-TE
   network or a layer 1/0 transport network) to provide connectivity
   and virtual network services for customers of the TE network [ACTN-
   Frame]. The services provided can be optimized to meet the
   requirements (such as traffic patterns, quality, and reliability) of
   the applications hosted by the customers. Data models are a
   representation of objects that can be configured or monitored within
   a system. Within the IETF, YANG [RFC6020] is the language of choice
   for documenting data models, and YANG models have been produced to
   allow configuration or modeling of a variety of network devices,
   protocol instances, and network services. YANG data models have been
   classified in [Netmod-Yang-Model-Classification] and [Service-YANG].

   [ACTN-VN-YANG] describes how customers or end to end orchestrators
   can request and/or instantiate a generic virtual network service.
   [ACTN-Applicability] describes a connection between IETF YANG model
   classifications to ACTN interfaces. In particular, it describes the
   customer service model can be mapped into the CMI (CNC-MDSC
   Interface) of the ACTN architecture.

   The YANG model on the ACTN CMI is known as customer service model in
   [Service-YANG]. [PCEP-Service-Aware] describes key network
   performance data to be considered for end-to-end path computation in
   TE networks. Key performance indicator is a term that describes
   critical performance data that may affect VN/TE service.

2. Use-Cases

   [ACTN-PERF] describes use-cases relevant to this draft. It
   introduces the dynamic creation, modification and optimization of
   services based on the performance monitoring in the Abstraction and
   Control of Transport Networks (ACTN) architecture. Figure 1 shows a
   high-level workflows for dynamic service control based on traffic
   monitoring.

   Some of the key points from [ACTN-PERF] are as follows:

     . Network traffic monitoring is important to facilitate automatic
        discovery of the imbalance of network traffic, and initiate the
        network optimization, thus helping the network operator or the
        virtual network service provider to use the network more
        efficiently and save CAPEX/OPEX.
     . Customer services have various SLA requirements, such as
        service availability, latency, latency jitter, packet loss
        rate, BER, etc. The transport network can satisfy service
        availability and BER requirements by providing different
        protection and restoration mechanisms. However, for other
        performance parameters, there are no such mechanisms. In order
        to provide high quality services according to customer SLA, one
        possible solution is to measure the service SLA related
        performance parameters, and dynamically provision and optimize
        services based on the performance monitoring results.
     . Performance monitoring in a large scale network could generate
        a huge amount of performance information. Therefore, the
        appropriate way to deliver the information in CMI and MPI
        interfaces should be carefully considered.

3. Design of the Data Models

   The YANG models developed in this document describe two models:

Internet-Draft  ACTN PM Telemetry & Network Autonomics        July 2017


   (i)   TE KPI Telemetry Model which provides the TE-Tunnel level of
          performance monitoring mechanism (See Section 2.1 for
          details)

   (ii)  ACTN TE KPI Telemetry Model which provides the VN level of the
          aggregated performance monitoring mechanism (See Section 2.2
          for details)


   The models include -

   (i)   Performance Telemetry details as measured during the last
          interval, ex delay.

   (ii)  Scaling Intent based on with TE/VN could be scaled in/out.

   [Editor's Note - Need to decide if scaling and telemetry can be in
   the same model as per the current draft.]



   TE KPI Telemetry Model

   This module describes performance telemetry for TE-tunnel model. The
   telemetry data is augmented to tunnel state.  This module also
   allows autonomic traffic engineering scaling intent configuration
   mechanism on the TE-tunnel level. Various conditions can be set for
   auto-scaling based on the telemetry data.

   The TE KPI Telemetry Model augments the TE-Tunnel Model to enhance
   TE performance monitoring capability. This monitoring capability
   will facilitate proactive re-optimization and reconfiguration of TEs
   based on the performance monitoring data collected via the TE KPI
   Telemetry YANG model.

   ACTN TE KPI Telemetry Model

   This module describes performance telemetry for ACTN VN model. The
   telemetry data is augmented both at the VN Level as well as
   individual VN member level. This module also allows autonomic
   traffic engineering scaling intent configuration mechanism on the VN
   level. Scale in/out criteria might be used for network autonomics in
   order the controller to react to a certain set of variations in
   monitored parameters.

   Moreover, this module also provides mechanism to define aggregated
   telemetry parameters as a grouping of underlying VN level telemetry
   parameters. Grouping operation (such as maximum, mean) could be set
   at the time of configuration. For example, if maximum grouping
   operation is used for delay at the VN level, the VN telemetry data
   is reported as the maximum {delay_vn_member_1, delay_vn_member_2, ..
   delay_vn_member_N}. Thus, this telemetry abstraction mechanism
   allows the grouping of a certain common set of telemetry values
   under a grouping operation. This can be done at the VN-member level
   to suggest how the E2E telemetry be inferred from the per domain
   tunnel created and monitored by PNCs. One proposed example is the
   following:

       +------------------------------------------------------------+
       | CNC                                                        |
       |                                                            |
       +------------------------------------------------------------+
       1.CNC sets the       |   /|\    2. MDSC gets VN Telemetry
         grouping op, and   |    |
         subscribes to the  |    |    VN KPI TELEMETRY (VN Level)
         VN level telemetry |    |    VN Bandwidth Utilization: Minimum
         for delay and      |    |     across VN members
         bandwidth util     |    |    VN Delay: Maximum across VN
                           \|/   |     Members
      +------------------------------------------------------------+
      | MDSC                                                       |
      |                                                            |
      +------------------------------------------------------------+




   The ACTN VN TE-Telemetry Model augments the basic ACTN VN model to
   enhance VN monitoring capability. This monitoring capability will
   facilitate proactive re-optimization and reconfiguration of VNs
   based on the performance monitoring data collected via the ACTN VN
   Telemetry YANG model.

4. Notification


   This model does not define specific notifications.  To enable
   notifications, the mechanism defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push]
   and [I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc5277bis] can be used.  This mechanism
   currently allows the user to:

     . Subscribe notifications on a per client basis.

     . Specify subtree filters or xpath filters so that only interested
       contents will be sent.

     . Specify either periodic or on-demand notifications.


   YANG Push Subscription Examples

   Below example shows the way for a client to subscribe for the
   telemetry information for a particular tunnel (Tunnel1). The
   telemetry parameter that the client is interested in is the utilized
   bandwidth.


   <netconf:rpc netconf:message-id="101"
       xmlns:netconf="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
       <establish-subscription

                     <name>Tunnel1</name>
                     <identifier/>

                           <utilized-

                        </te-telemetry>
                     </state>
                    </tunnel>
                 </tunnels>
             </te>
          </filter>
          <period>500</period>
          <encoding>encode-xml</encoding>
       </establish-subscription>
    </netconf:rpc>


   This example shows the way for a client to subscribe for the
   telemetry information for all VNs. The telemetry parameter that the
   client is interested in is packet-loss and utilized bandwidth.

   <netconf:rpc netconf:message-id="101"

5. YANG Data Tree


   A graphical representation of the complete data tree is presented
   here.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as follows
   and as per [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc6087bis].  Each node is printed as:
   <status> <flags> <name> <opts> <type> <if-features>

           <status> is one of:
             +  for current
             x  for deprecated
             o  for obsolete

           <flags> is one of:
             rw  for configuration data
             ro  for non-configuration data
             -x  for rpcs and actions
             -n  for notifications

           <name> is the name of the node
             (<name>) means that the node is a choice node
            :(<name>) means that the node is a case node

           If the node is augmented into the tree from another module,
           its name is printed as <prefix>:<name>.

           <opts> is one of:
             ?  for an optional leaf, choice, anydata or anyxml
             !  for a presence container
             *  for a leaf-list or list
             [<keys>] for a list's keys

           <type> is the name of the type for leafs and leaf-lists

             If the type is a leafref, the type is printed as "->
             TARGET",

             where TARGET is either the leafref path, with prefixed
             removed if possible.

           <if-features> is the list of features this node depends on,

7. Security Considerations

   The configuration, state, and action data defined in this document
   are designed to be accessed via a management protocol with a secure
   transport layer, such as NETCONF [RFC6241].  The NETCONF access
   control model [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for
   particular NETCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available
   NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   A number of configuration data nodes defined in this document are
   writable/deletable (i.e., "config true") These data nodes may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
