Internet-Draft  Univer6 Architecture for IPv6 Transition        Jan 2009


Abstract

   IPv6 transition is becoming an important research topic recently.  In
   traditional architecture, transition mechanisms are closely connected
   with application, protocol stack, and network equipments.  This makes
   the transition process very complicated, and increases the difficulty
   of network management.  In this document, we present a new network
   architecture called Univer6.  It uses IPv6 as a unified middle
   layer,thus can adapt to various kinds of applications and network
   equipments.  Univer6 will help provide a smooth transition towards
   IPv6, simplify network management process, and accelerate the
   development of IPv6.

Internet-Draft  Univer6 Architecture for IPv6 Transition        Jan 2009


1.  Introduction

   This memo is intended to descirbe a possible direction for IPv6
   transition.  With the development of IPv6 protocol, IPv6 network and
   test-beds are gradually built around the world, including CERNET2 in
   China, Internet2 in USA, and GeAnt2 in Europe.  Meanwhile, IPv6
   transition is rapidly becoming an important research topic.  Several
   mechanism concerning IPv6 access, IPv6 tunnel, IPv6 applications have
   been raised, and many transition methods have been proposed for
   different network environments.

   However, in traditional network architecture, the transition methods
   are usually closely connected with all the factors such as
   application, protocol stack and network equipments.  This close
   coupling increases the complexity of IPv6 transition process, and
   makes it difficult to carry out network managements.  In order to
   solve these problems, we propose a new network architecture called
   Univer6 in this document.  It uses IPv6 as a unified layer between
   different kinds of network infrastructures and the applications in
   the upper layer, which saves existing investments in network
   infrastructures, and provides a smooth IPv6 transition once and for
   all from the end users' point of view.  This architecture can also
   make it easier for network management, and accelerate the transition
   process towards IPv6.

2.  Requirement for the architecture

   With the deployment of IPv6, there will be two seperated large
   networks:

   o  Native IPv4 network.  It is the legacy of the current Internet.
      The routers can only forward IPv4 packets, while the hosts may be
      dual-stack by updating the software.

   o  Native IPv6 network.  There may be no IPv4 address block available
      when setting up new network.  The routers can only forward IPv6
      packets.  The hosts are using dual-stack, or only supporting IPv6.
      Even if the routers are dual-stack, there is no global IPv4
      address allocated for the network.

   There are also some dual-stack networks.  Both routers and hosts have
   dual-stack support, and both global IPv6 and IPv4 address are
   allocated for the network.  Such network can be viewed as the
   overlapped part of native IPv4 network and native IPv6 network as
   shown in Figure 1.

   In the coexisting of both IPv4 and IPv6 native networks, to promote
   the deployment of IPv6, some important requirements should be
   addressed:

   1.  Protect the legacy investnment on IPv4 native network.  The
       routers and switches that can only support IPv4 will not be taken
       place by IPv6-enabled network devices, due to high cost of new
       devices and the estimation of no extra income from IPv6 in the

       near future.  End users should have the ability to access IPv6
       even with no changes to the IPv4 routers and switches.

   2.  Provide a way for universal access.  IPv4 and IPv6 are two
       different "language" that can not directly talk to each other.
       There has been a large amount of users in the IPv4 native
       network.  With the using up of IPv4 address, it is expected that
       there will also be a large amount of users in the IPv6 native
       network.  The users in "IPv4 continent" and in "IPv6 continent"
       should have the ability to access each other in an end-to-end
       way.

   3.  Provide support for legacy IPv4 applications.  Even some IPv4
       applications can be modified to support IPv6, some will never be
       modified to have IPv6 support.  There should have support for
       such IPv4 application to run over IPv6 only network.

3.  The Univer6 architecture

3.1.  Description of the architecture

   Here we describe an architecture to meet the requirements analyzed
   above.  The Univer6 architecture is composed of three-layers.  In the
   "Infrastructure Layer", there may be IPv4 native network or IPv6
   native network.  Over the Infrastructure Layer, "Protocol Layer" can
   provide univeral access to IPv6 for all the users either in the IPv4
   native network or in the IPv6 native network.  The Protocol Layer
   should support both IPv4 application and IPv6 application in the
   Application Layer over the IPv6 protocol.  There is a "IPv4 Adaption"
   function in the "Protocol Layer" to support IPv4 appliation running
   over IPv6.

   The basic idea of Univer6 is to use IPv6 as a unified middle layer
   between applications and network infrastructures.  As for
   applications we have IPv4-only and IPv4/IPv6 applications nowadays.
   And in the future, IPv6-only applications may start to come up.  When
   it comes to infrastructures, the situation is even more complex.  We
   have IPv4 native network, IPv4/IPv6 dual stack network, and IPv6
   native network.  And a variety of mechanisms including Tunnel Broker,
   6to4, DSTM, ISATAP and Teredo have been deployed to provide IPv6
   access in different networks and during different IPv6 transition
   stages.  Considering these factors, we paid special attention to the
   adaptability of Univer6, and the proposed architecture is as shown in
   Figure 2.

   Figure 2.  Univer6 architecture

   From Figure 2, we can see that Univer6 consists of three layers:

   o  Application interface (AI) layer.  This layer provides support for
      the applications in the upper layer, and handles all data packets
      sent from/to them.  In order to support applications, this layer
      can provide a group of new API, or carry out translation between
      IPv4 and IPv6 API's.  Meanwhile, since IPv4 applications need 32-
      bit IPv4 addresses to work, AI layer should provide addresses in
      the correct format.  Also, in order to use IPv6 as a unified
      middle layer, all packets from user applications should be
      processed first (encapsulated if necessary) into IPv6 packets.
      This task is carried out in AI layer too.

Internet-Draft  Univer6 Architecture for IPv6 Transition        Jan 2009


   o  Universal IPv6 layer.  This is a unified middle layer in Univer6
      architecture, and tasks are mainly concerned about IPv6 protocol
      itself.  In this layer, we designed a security module to provide
      protections.  Mechanisms like IPv6 firewall deal with not only
      IPv6 security issues, but also security problems during IPv6
      transition.  We have also designed an address validation module to
      ensure the validity of IPv6 addresses.  This will make IPv6
      address a trustable identifier, and help with network management.

   o  Network interface (NI) layer.  This layer performs actual data
      packet transfer.  So its main task is to find a proper way to
      deliver packets according to different network environments.  Most
      of existing transition mechanisms can be included into this layer
      and applied.  Since IPv6 is used as a unified middle layer,
      encapsulation and decapsulation may be needed in this layer in an
      IPv4 network environment.  In IPv6 environment, packets can be
      directly delivered, and NI will carry out the task of IPv6 network
      access.

3.2.  Advantages of the architecture

   Compared with the traditional network architecture, Univer6 have some
   advantages in the following areas:

   1.  Smooth IPv6 transition.  In the traditional architecture,
       transition mechanisms are closely related to infrastructures and
       applications.  If the network equipments get upgraded or changed,
       users have to make corresponding adjustments.  This causes much
       trouble for users during different stages of IPv6 transition.
       Univer6 will help solve this problem.  From the user's point of
       view, when Univer6 is deployed, it will feel like the transition
       to IPv6 is finished once and for all, while equipments in the
       network can be gradually updated or replaced from IPv4 to dual
       stack, and finally to IPv6.  For ISPs and network administrators,
       this means existing investments can be saved, and they can
       provide their customers with IPv6 service immediately.

   2.  Network management.  In the traditional architecture, if a host
       is located in a dual stack network environment, it will have two
       different kinds of identifiers (IP addresses) at the same time.
       This will make it harder to build up an identifying system, and
       bring extra complexity to network configuration and management.
       In Univer6, IPv6 is used as a universal middle layer for all
       hosts.  The vast space of IPv6 address can provide a global
       identification for all the users.  Furthermore, after we deploy
       address validation mechanism in Univer6, each user can be
       correctly identified by its address.  This will simplify the
       network management process, and make network configuration much

       easier and faster.

   3.  IPv6 usage.  Currently, most network applications use IPv4
       protocol.  Although many are being upgraded to support IPv6, the
       number of IPv6 applications is still quite small.  This results
       in the fact that many IPv6 networks are not put into use often
       enough, and valuable bandwidth resources are being wasted.  In
       Univer6 architecture, we can provide support for IPv4
       applications in the upper layer, and transfer data packets by
       using IPv6 networks in the lower layer.  This will bring IPv4
       applications into IPv6 networks, and make full use of existing
       IPv6 bandwidth.

   Figure 3.  Application Interface (AI) layer

   The function of API module is to provide programming interface
   support for upper layer applications.  It contains a group of IPv4/
   IPv6 adaptive interfaces, and carries out automatic translation /
   conversion between IPv4 and IPv6 API's when it's necessary.  For the
   design of programming interface, IETF v6ops workgroup has proposed
   some basic guidelines for IPv4/IPv6 application development .  As for
   API translation, existing mechanisms like BIA [RFC3338] contains some
   similar function modules, and can be used as a reference during

   standardization process.

   DNS module handles address resolution requests from applications, and
   its task is to provide addresses in the correct formats.  Since IPv6
   is the unified middle layer in Univer6, IPv6 addresses will be
   acquired without difficulty.  However, if the upper layer application
   uses IPv4, DNS module should reply with a 32-bit IPv4 address.  If
   the host is located in an IPv4 or dual stack environment, this
   address can be acquired directly from the network.  If the network
   environment is IPv6, we can use a mechanism to generate an IPv4
   address (like BIS) for the application.  Currently, transition
   mechanisms like BIA and BIS contain some similar functions, and we
   are also carrying out research to support IPv4 applications in IPv6
   environment.  The results from these researches can be used for
   making standards for the DNS module.

   In the data packet plane, all packets from AI layer are finally
   delivered to the universal IPv6 layer.  IPv6 packets can be delivered
   directly, and IPv4 packets will be encapsulated in an IPv6 header.
   Meanwhile, packets from IPv6 layer will be de-encapsulated (if
   necessary) and passed on to the user applications.

4.2.  Universal IPv6 layer

   After going through AI layer, all packets delivered to this layer are
   in the format of IPv6.  So, Universal IPv6 layer only has to deal
   with specific issues concern IPv6 protocol.  No encapsulation/de-
   encapsulation process is needed, and packets can be sent to NI layer
   without modification.  In this layer, modules are inserted to provide
   different IPv6 features including security, mobility, configuration,
   etc.  Meanwhile, in order to provide necessary communication for the
   other two layers, an address management module is introduced into
   this layer.  Requests from DNS are handled in this module, and
   addresses acquired from the lower layer are kept in this module, too.

   The most important modules in this layer are:

   o  Address Validation Module.  In IPv6 protocol, the 128 bit address
      space can give every user in the world a global IPv6 address.
      This address can be used as an identifier for the user, and become
      a helpful factor for network configuration and management.
      However, in current network, the problem of IP address spoofing is
      very serious.  If we want to set up an identification system using
      IPv6 address, we should first solve the issue of IPv6 address
      validation.  Currently, a lot of researches on address validation
      are being carried out, and some mechanisms like SAVA
      [draft-baker-sava-simple-00] and deployment guidelines
      [draft-wu-sava-testbed-experience-06] have been proposed.  These

Internet-Draft  Univer6 Architecture for IPv6 Transition        Jan 2009


      research results can be integrated into the address validation
      module in Univer6.

   o  Security Module.  This module deals with not only security issues
      of IPv6 protocol itself, but also security issues during different
      stages of IPv6 transition, like security issues for each
      transition mechanism, risks brought up by IPv4/IPv6 co-existence,
      effects on existing IPv4 security architecture by applying IPv6,
      etc.  Particularly, the effect brought by IPv6 address allocation
      needs to be carefully considered.  In most IPv4 firewalls and
      other security mechanisms, IP address always plays a very
      important role.  Rules and ACL's (Access Control List) often
      contain one or many fixed IP addresses.  However, IPv6 uses some
      new features like SLAAC to acquire an address, and this acquired
      address may even change from time to time.  This causes great
      challenge to traditional security mechanisms, and may affect their
      performance and effectiveness.  Therefore, the research for a new
      IPv6 firewall architecture is quite necessary.  Currently, the
      v6ops workgroup at IETF have proposed some drafts about IPv6
      transition security [RFC4942], and researches on a proper and
      comprehensive solution mechanism are being carried out.

   o  Address Management Module.  This module provides a communication
      path between Application Interface layer and Network Interface
      layer.  When a host is connected to a network, addresses acquired
      from the network will be passed to this module from the NI layer.
      When DNS module in the AI layer sends a DNS request, this module
      will return the correct address according to the requirements.
      For some transition mechanisms like DSTM, hosts should ask a
      server for an IP address.  This address application process is
      actually carried out in the NI layer, but the triggering of such a
      process is handled by this module.

   Aside from these modules, we can also insert many other modules that
   correspond to some IPv6 features.  Like mobility, configuration,
   multi-homing, etc.  With the development of IPv6 protocol, new
   modules can be continuously added into this layer, and provide better
   services for the users.

4.3.  Network Interface (NI) layer

   Network interface (NI) layer performs actual data packet transfer.
   So its main task is to find a proper way to deliver packets according
   to different network environments.  The modules in this layer are
   shown in Figure 4.

   Network environment detection module detects the host's network
   environment.  During different stages of transition, transition
   mechanisms may change from time to time.  Network equipments may be
   upgraded or changed, and some functions may be turned on / off.
   Meanwhile, a mobile host like notepad may be located in different
   kinds of networks at different time.  All these situations call for
   an environment detect module.  This module will gather information
   from the lower layers, including IP protocol in use, IP address, and
   transition strategy.  This information is then provided to other
   modules to make proper decisions.  Generally speaking, when a user is
   connected to a network, the network environment will not change very
   frequently (for mobile users in wireless LAN, the situation may be a
   little different).  So, the network environment detection module only
   has to detect once at the beginning of network access, and
   periodically check the environment change at a lower frequency after
   that.

   Access / transfer management module is the most important module in
   this layer.  It will choose proper strategies to carry out IPv6
   access and data packet transfer.  Basically, there are three kinds of
   IPv6 access and data transfer: direct access / transfer, tunnel
   access / transfer, and overlay access / transfer.  When a host is
   located in an IPv6 native network, or a dual stack network that
   connects to IPv6 backbone network, the direct access mechanism can be
   used, and data packets are sent in the form of IPv6.  If the host is
   in an IPv4 network, some mechanisms like configured tunnel or 6to4

   [RFC3056] will be needed to gain access to IPv6 network.  IPv6-in-
   IPv4 tunnel is the most common mechanism today, and data packets are
   sent through such tunnels in the form of IPv6-in-IPv4 packets.  In
   the early stage of transition, groups of medium-sized IPv6 enterprise
   / ISP networks will be located around the world.  The separated
   networks seem like a group of IPv6 islands distributed in the
   Internet, so an overlay mechanism can be introduced to connect them
   with each other, and to the IPv6 backbone network.  In a nutshell,
   most existing transition mechanisms can be integrated into this
   module and used for suitable scenarios.  As for the automatic network
   environment detection mechanism, the v6ops workgroup in IETF has
   proposed some guidelines and possible solutions
   [draft-palet-v6ops-auto-trans-02].  These guidelines and solutions
   can be used to help make final standards of the access / transfer
   module.

   IP address acquire / apply module is another useful module in the
   network interface layer.  On one hand, when a host gets connected to
   a network, this module will collect the address information of the
   host, and provide both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses (if any) to the
   management module in the upper layer.  On the other hand, if the host
   is located in an IPv6 native network and needs to communicate with
   another host using IPv4, mechanisms like DSTM will be needed to apply
   for a temporary IPv4 address from the server.  IP address acquire /
   apply module will send out such requests to the server, and deal with
   possible authentication / responses from the server.  Also, if two
   hosts are both located in IPv6 native networks, but the applications
   on them use IPv4 protocol, it is necessary for both of them to find a
   way to assign an IPv4 address for each other.  We have designed a
   protocol to carry out IPv4 address negotiation between two IPv6
   hosts, and this protocol will also be integrated into the IP address
   acquire / apply module.

5.  The challenges

   We have described Univer6 and its modules in detail.  In order to
   improve the features of Univer6 and put it into real use, there are
   still some issues to be considered in the future:

   o  Module Standardization.  Currently, many transition mechanisms
      have been proposed, and some of them are being deployed and used
      in different networks.  During the design of Univer6, it will be
      very helpful to consider these existing mechanisms, and try to
      make Univer6 compliant with them.  Research on other mechanisms
      will also provide some useful tips for designing a better
      architecture, and make the final standards of Univer6 more
      comprehensive.

   o  Security.  As mentioned in the previous sections, the security
      issues exist not only in IPv6 itself, but also in IPv6 transition.
      Security research on IPv6 like firewall is still at an early
      stage, as it goes on, many new features will start to come up.
      Also, existing IPv4 mechanisms should be taken into consideration.
      So, it is an important issue to design a flexible security module
      for Univer6.

   o  Application Mode.  Nowadays, most IPv6 applications come from
      simply upgraded IPv4 applications.  If the new features of IPv6
      protocol can be fully researched and brought into use, it will
      greatly accelerate IPv6 transition.  Univer6 uses IPv6 as a
      unified middle layer, and we will try to provide new application
      modes based on it.  For example, after we deploy address
      validation mechanism in the network, each host can be identified
      by its own IPv6 address, and source address information in the IP
      header can be used to provide different kinds of services.  We are
      planning to design a mechanism to provide different levels of QoS
      (Quality of Service) for different types of IPv6 addresses.  We
      can use 4 to 8 bits in the IPv6 address as a sign for different
      user levels and kinds of application types.  Network
      administrators and ISP's can make necessary adjustments on the
      routers to optimize the transfer process according to different
      flow types.  This will provide a better user experience, as well
      as improve the network management process.
