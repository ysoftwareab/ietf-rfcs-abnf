Abstract

   This document serves to register a media type for the SMPTE Material
   Exchange Format (MXF).  MXF, defined by SMPTE 377M [SMPTE377M], is a
   standard wrapper format developed for the interchange of audiovisual
   material, including both audiovisual essence and rich metadata.

Internet-Draft       Media Type Registration for MXF       December 2005


1.  Introduction

   The present document registers a media type for SMPTE Material
   Exchange Format (MXF).  MXF, defined by SMPTE 377M [SMPTE377M], is a
   standard wrapper format developed for the interchange of audiovisual
   material, including both audiovisual essence and rich metadata.  MXF
   is an important tool in providing interoperation between different
   video systems as well as digital cinema systems.  MXF also aids in
   the development of video production and distribution workflows that
   are more efficient, multi-vendor, file-based, and IT-oriented.

   The media type defined here is needed to correctly identify MXF files
   when they are served over HTTP or other network connections, included
   in multi-part documents, indexed by operating systems and digital
   asset management systems, or when used in other places where media
   types are used.


2.  Security Considerations

   Security requirements for the application/mxf media type are
   discussed in the IANA media type registration (Section 3.1).


3.  IANA Considerations

   The present document requests that IANA registers the media type
   application/mxf as specified in Section 3.1.  The registration uses
   the template present in [RFC4288].

3.1.  Media Type for SMPTE Material Exchange Format (MXF)

      To: ietf-types@iana.org
      Subject: Registration of media type application/mxf

      Type name: application

      Subtype name: mxf

      Required parameters: none

      Optional parameters: none

      Encoding considerations: binary

      Security considerations: Application/mxf objects are not signed
      but may be partially encrypted internally.  External security
      mechanisms must be employed to ensure content confidentiality.
      MXF, through metadata extensions, may allow executable code to be
      transferred in the file.  It is suggested that no unauthenticated
      executables decoded from an MXF file be executed.  Some compressed
      essence types carried in MXF may carry a risk that certain
      pathological bitstreams could lead to potential denial-of-service
      attacks against these essence decoders.

      Interoperability considerations: MXF provides a standard wrapping
      for a number of audio and video essence types according to a
      number of different Operational Patterns (OP).  Thus
      interoperability depends upon the MXF file decoder having the
      capability to match the features of the MXF file encoder.  An
      Application Specification (AS) can ensure that MXF encoders and
      decoders can effectively interoperate.

      Published specification: RFC XXXX, SMPTE 377M [SMPTE377M]

      Applications which use this media type: MXF is a wrapper for many
      types of audio and video essence types in use by many applications
      in the broadcast and digital cinema industries.

      Additional information:

         Magic number(s): none

         File extension(s): .mxf

         Macintosh File Type Code(s): "mxf "

4.  RFC Editor Considerations

   The reference to RFC XXXX in the media type registration
   (Section 3.1) should be replaced with the actual RFC number of this
   document when it is issued.

   Please remove this section before publication as RFC.
