Introduction</h3>

<p>As discussed at some length on the SIP and SIPPING mailing lists and recently
	summarized by John Elwell in <a class='info' href='#I-D.elwell-sip-e2e-identity-important'>[I&#8209;D.elwell&#8209;sip&#8209;e2e&#8209;identity&#8209;important]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Elwell, J., &ldquo;End-to-End Identity Important in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> 
	there are significant challenges in identifying and authenticating
	the source of a SIP request outside of a single administrative
	domain. If an end user cannot trust the
	identity of the caller, there is the potential for all sorts of
	fraud and abuse.  Imagine, for instance, if a home user thought
	that the call was coming from their bank or credit card company. Or
	if a business user thought that a call they received was from one
	of their suppliers.  In both cases, confidential information could
	be divulged that could lead to identity theft or other forms of
	fraud.
</p>
<p>The capability to forge/spoof Caller ID certainly exists on the Public Switched
	Telephone Network (PSTN) and there are numerous web sites making
	this an easy task. However, regular phones connected to the PSTN do not have
	any way to indicate that the caller's identity can be trusted and
	in informal questioning the author has found that most people (outside
	the telecommunications industry) still put
	a high degree of trust in "Caller ID". This trust may undoubtedly
	continue for some time until sufficient abuse occurs.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the world of SIP it is even easier than the
	PSTN to
	"spoof" what is normally presented as "Caller ID" through simple
	modification of the From or <a class='info' href='#RFC3325'>P-Asserted-Identity<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jennings, C., Peterson, J., and M. Watson, &ldquo;Private Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Asserted Identity within Trusted Networks,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3325] headers.  This
	modification could occur conceivably at any point in the chain of
	transmission between the SIP source and destination.  SIP Identity
	defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC4474'>[RFC4474]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Peterson, J. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> attempts to address this issue
	but for reasons outlined in both  <a class='info' href='#I-D.elwell-sip-e2e-identity-important'>[I&#8209;D.elwell&#8209;sip&#8209;e2e&#8209;identity&#8209;important]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Elwell, J., &ldquo;End-to-End Identity Important in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>  and  <a class='info' href='#I-D.kaplan-sip-uris-change'>[I&#8209;D.kaplan&#8209;sip&#8209;uris&#8209;change]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kaplan, H., &ldquo;Why URIs Are Changed Crossing Domains,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> this mechanism often fails.
	
</p>
<p>The danger here is that if "identity" within the world of SIP
	rapidly becomes abused we will find ourselves in a situation where
	SIP identity is given the same amount of credibility as email
	sender addresses are given, which is to say almost none. The
	volume of email spam has reached a point where sender email
	addresses are very often viewed as suspicious. As we move to an
	increasingly interconnected SIP infrastructure, there exists the
	potential for SIP caller addresses to be viewed in a similar
	fashion.
</p>
<p>As efforts are underway to address this issue through either
	modification of RFC4474 SIP Identity or through the development of
	other identity mechanisms, it is suggested that consideration be
	given to how the "trusted identity" will be indicated to the end
	user when the end-to-end identity can in fact be authenticated.
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Recommendation</h3>

<p>It is recommended that a common visual identifier be developed
	that would be recommended for usage across SIP endpoints to
	indicated that a user is communicating with someone whose identity
	is "trusted".
</p>
<p>As an example, consider the "lock" icon used by most web
	browsers to indicate that a user is communicating using HTTPS and
	that the communication between the browser and web server is encrypted
	using SSL/TLS.  Browsers may display the lock icon in different
	locations but if the user is consistently using that browser, he or
	she will become accustomed to where the lock is located. While it
	is not clear that users do in fact look for this lock icon before
	divulging confidential information, the fact remains that this icon
	is there on most browsers should the user choose to look for it.
</p>
<p>In the SIP world, it is not immediately clear what form this
	visual identifier should take.  A lock icon is certainly one possibility, but it
	is used within web browsers to indicate the use of encrypted media
	and as
	discussed below, a call can have a trusted identity but not
	necessarily use encryption for media. Should this work move
	forward, more investigation needs to be done into what is the
	appropriate form of the visual identifier.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Challenges</h3>

<p>There are a number of challenges to both the development
      and deployment of such a visual identifier.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Non-visual Endpoints</h3>

<p>While many SIP endpoints may "IP phones" or "softphones" where
	the use of a visual identifier makes sense, there are certainly
	other SIP endpoints where a visual identifier may not be useful or
	even possible.  For instance, interfaces developed for the
	visually-impaired would not have a visual display unit for the
	user.  Similarly, command-line-based SIP endpoints may have no way
	of displaying visual indicators.
</p>
<p>It may be that the initial path forward is to standardize a common
	visual identifier for SIP endpoints where such an identifier can be
	displayed and then look separately at how to address the issue of indicating
	trust for endpoints where such an indicator does not make sense.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Many Vendors</h3>

<p>It goes without saying that for a common visual identifier to
	actually be useful to end users, it will need to ultimately be
	adopted by a significant number of SIP endpoint vendors.
	Development of such a visual identifier will need to be done in
	consultation with a wide range of vendors.

<a name="rfc.section.3.3"></a><h3>3.3.&nbsp;
Limited Display Size</h3>

<p>For some SIP endpoints, such as softphones, there may be no
	  issue at all with adding additional icons or other symbols to the
	  user interface.  However, with some SIP endpoints, such as
	  lower-end "hard" phones, the display space may be limited to only
	  a few lines of text, much of which may be taken up by the Caller
	  ID, time of the call and other information.  There may not be
	  space in the display to accomodate another visual identifier.
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.3.4"></a><h3>3.4.&nbsp;
Fonts</h3>

<p>Similar to the limited display size, some SIP endpoints may be
	  limited in the available fonts for display.  Some endpoints may
	  allow the display of any image or character, while others may
	  only allow the use of very specific fonts.  A visual identifier
	  would need to be from those fonts - or it would not be visible on
	  these SIP endpoints.
</p>
<p>One path may be that there is a visual identifier that is more
	  of an image for use in softphones and other SIP endpoints that can
	  use such an identifier and a different identifier, perhaps
	  text-based, that is used by SIP endpoints that cannot display the
	  image identifier.

<a name="rfc.section.3.5"></a><h3>3.5.&nbsp;
Multiple Callers</h3>

<p>While a visual indicator may work well in a call between two
	 parties, it is not clear how the identifier should work in a
	 situation where the call involves multiple parties and the call
	 legs are being connected in the SIP endpoint itself, i.e. not in a
	 conference bridge.  If there are three parties in the call and
	 both of the external parties have trusted identies, the visual
	 identifier could still be used.  But what if one party has a
	 trusted identity but the other one does not?  Some SIP endpoints
	 such as softphones may be able to display a visual indicator on a
	 per-user basis. Other endpoints may not be able to do so. It is
	 not immediately clear what the best policy is in this situation.

<a name="rfc.section.3.6"></a><h3>3.6.&nbsp;
Trusted Identity does not
      mean a 'secure call'</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, the lock icon might be a logical choice
	  based on current browser usage, but in the browser world it is
	  used to indicated an encrypted connection and that it is not
	  necessarily true with trusted identity.  With RFC4474, the
	  identity of the caller is authenticated through the signing of
	  portions of the SIP header.  This in no way requires the
	  encryption of the media stream but yet most users would probably
	  think of an "encrypted phone call" as one in which the media
	  stream is encrypted.  In many cases, particularly those with the
	  use of DTLS-SRTP, the media stream would be encrypted, but this
	  encryption cannot be assumed for all connections.  For that
	  reason, the lock icon is not the best choice. [The author also
	  believes that at least one vendor may already be using the lock
	  icon to indicate media encryption is present.]
</p>
<p>Within web browsers, there is a similar issue going on where
	  primarily due to concerns related to phishing and Internet fraud,
	  some companies have moved to using Extended Validation SSL (EV
	  SSL) certicates where the Certificate Authority issuing the SSL
	  certificate conducts a more rigorous process to authenticate the
	  identity of the entity to whom the certificate is issued.  Browsers then
	  indicate to the user in some fashion that the identity of the
	  server site has been certified to a higher standard.  To the
	  author's knowledge, there is no
	  common icon used but instead the major browsers seem to be
	  changing the browsers address bar to be green and potentially
	  providing server information on the bar as well.  Obviously this
	  exact mechanism would not work well in a SIP environment where many endpoints

Is the IETF the correct
      organization to address this issue?</h3>

<p>Perhaps the largest challenge from the author's point-of-view 
	  is the overarching question of whether or not the IETF is the 
	  correct place to be discussing this matter.  For "trusted
	  identity" to be successful in the SIP marketplace, it would seem
	  that some type of visual identifier would be necessary for users
	  to know when the caller's identity can be trusted.  For maximum
	  acceptance, it would be ideal if this visual identifier was a
	  common identifier used by the majority of manufacturers of SIP
	  endpoints, rather than each manufacturer developing such a visual
	  identifier on their own.  For such a common identifier to be
	  developed, it would seem to require the coordination of some
	  industry-wide and industry-neutral entity.
</p>
<p>However, this
	  is not really a technical issue or a protocol issue but rather
	  one of user interface design. Is this appropriate work for the
	  IETF?  Or should this perhaps be done by an industry organization
	  such as the SIP Forum whose aim is more to coordinate activities
	  between vendors?  Is there a more appropriate home for this work?

Conclusions</h3>

<p>As we work on improving mechanisms to develop end-to-end
	authenticated identification of parties involved in communication
	using SIP, it is worth considering
	that for widespread acceptance of the "trusted identity" by end
	users there exists the need for some common visual identifier
	(where appropriate) that end users can understand indicates the
	level of trust they should put in the caller identification. If
	such a common identifier can be developed and adopted by major
	manufacturers of SIP endpoints, this may help speed the user
	adoption and acceptance of trusted identity mechanisms developed by
	the IETF.

<a name="rfc.section.6"></a><h3>6.&nbsp;
Security Considerations</h3>

<p>The key security issue with any system such as this is in ensuring
	that the visual identifier cannot be spoofed by an attacker.  If
	end users grow to accept and trust the visual identifier to indicate that
	the other party has a "trusted identity", then it becomes
	worthwhile for an attacker to try to spoof this identifier in some
	fashion to trick the end user into believing that they are speaking
	with a caller whose identity they can trust.  However this
	identifier is implemented by vendors, analysis will need to be done
	around how to protect against such attacks.
</p>
<p>Any such visual identifier is also subject to the inherent weakness 
	of all SIP identity mechanisms that the identity of the SIP
	endpoint can be ascertained but not necessarily the person speaking
	into that endpoint.  The identifier can indicate that the trusted
	identity of the SIP endpoint calling is "Dan York" but cannot
	indicate that Dan York is in fact the person speaking into the
	phone.
