3.  Network

   The network consists of 5 routers and 2 traffic generator ports.  DUT
   is acting as one of MH PE to CE.The RR is acting as route reflector
   and core router.R1 is a Single home router running pbbevpn.  All four
   routers except CE are running mpls,bgp.  CE is a dual home connected
   to DUT and MH PE1.  The testing will be done on DUT to bench mark the
   service.DUT and MHPE2 is running PBB-EVPN with SA/AA with CE.The DUT
   and and other PE's will be running 100 PBB-EVN instances on 100 sub
   interfaces.

4.  Test Procedure

   The test defined to bench mark the performance of PBB-EVPN mac
   learning in control pland and data plane.  Mac flush,High
   Availablity, convergence time in link failures,Reliablity,scale
   scenarios.

4.1.  Customer MAC Learning in Data Plane and B-MAC in control plane

   The Customer MAC will be learned in data plane, test is to measure
   the time taken to learn the "X" number of mac's in time "T".  The
   data plane learning will from the locally connected interface.  The
   control plane learning of B-MAC is through BGP advertisements from
   the remote PE.Let the local learning time be "T" and control plane
   learning of the B-MAC time be "T'".

4.2.  MAC flush for locally learned and remote learned MAC

   The time taken to flush the "X" locally learned mac, let it be "T1"
   once the traffic is stopped.  The time taken flush the remote mac
   which learned by data plane that "X" macs when the traffic is
   stopped at remote side.Let the measured time is "T2".

4.3.  High Availablity

   The traffic is flowing bi direction.  The bgp is converged, let the
   "X" numbers of macs learned locally and remotely.  Then traffic is
   flowing at "P" packets per sec.  The traffic generator is measuring
   the Tx and Rx packets, while the routing engine failover there should
   not any packet loss the router tester must show both "P" packet per
   seconds.

4.4.  Reliablity

   This is to measure during any events like adding a new PE or
   rebooting on of the MHPE in the same ethernet segment,there should
   not any issues in DF election.  There should not be any loop.  The DF
   elction must take place in t time where 4>t>3.  The DF election must
   work on V mod N.  There should not be any loop in traffic.

4.5.  Convergence Time

   During any events like link failure, hard reset measure the time
   taken to learn "X" mac's locally and remotely or time taken to learn
   "X" mac locally and remote.

4.6.  Scale

   This is to measure the performance of DUT in scaling to "X" PBB-EVPN
   instances.  The measured parameters are CPU usage, memory
   leak,crashes.

4.7.  SOAK

   This is measuring the performance of DUT running with scaled
   configuration with traffic over a peroid of time "T'".  In each
   interval "t1" the parameters measured are CPU usage, memory usage,
   crashes.

   R1 with different SA and DA so that 200,000 mac address will be
   learned in DUT.  There is a bi directional traffic flow with 100,000
   pps in each direction.  Then reboot DUT since there are 2 MH PE's the
   other PE will become the DF then after DUT comes back, then DF
   election has to re initiate.

   Procedure:

   Configure PBB-EVPN EVI in R1,MHPE2,DUT.All 4 routers except CE are
   running mpls,bgp,RR is acting as route reflector to R1,MHPE2 and
   DUT.Once the bgp comes up check the DUT evpn table.For MH PE ESI must
   be configured per IFD/Interface.  Using RT(traffic generator) to send
   the traffic to the routers.

   Measurement

   The DF election has to take place again once the DUT comes back
   online.There should not be any DF stuck casefor 100 PBB-EVPN
   instances.

5.4.  Scale

5.4.1.  To Scale the DUT to 4k PBB-EVPN instances and clear bgp in DUT
        without traffic.

   Objective:

   The main purpose of the test the DUT performance to scale 4k PBB-EVPN
   instances.  Then clear bgp neighbor.  There should not be any loss of
   routes or any crashes.

Internet-Draft      PBB-EVPN Benchmarking Methodology          June 2016


   Procedure:

   Configure PBB-EVPN instances in R1,MHPE2,DUT.All 4 routers except CE
   are running mpls,bgp,RR is acting as route reflector to R1,MHPE2 and
   DUT.Once the bgp comes up check the DUT evpn table.For MH PE ESI must
   be configured per IFD/Interface.  Using RT(traffic generator) to send
   the traffic to the routers.

   Measurement

   There should not be any loss of route types 2,3 and 4 in DUT.

5.4.2.  To Scale the DUT to 4k PBB-EVPN instances and clear bgp in DUT
        with traffic.  Measure the convergence time

   Objective:

   The main purpose of the test the DUT performance to scale 4k pbb-evpn
   instances with traffic.Then clear bgp neighbor.There should not be
   any loss of routes or any crashes.  Send 100,000 frames from CE to
   DUT from traffic generator with different SA and DA for 5 pbb-evpn
   instances.Send 100,000 frames from traffic generator to R1 with
   different SA and DA for 5 pbb-evpn instances.so that 1,000,000 mac
   address will be learned in DUT.  There is a bi directional traffic
   flow with 500,000 pps in each direction.  Then clear the bgp nei in
   DUT after the bgp comes up and started learning the routes, measure
   the time taken to learn all 1,000,000 macs in DUT.

   Procedure:

   Configure PBB-EVPN instances in R1,MHPE2,DUT.All 4 routers except CE
   are running mpls,bgp,RR is acting as route reflector to R1,MHPE2 and
   DUT.Once the bgp comes up check the DUT evpn table.For MH PE ESI must
   be configured per IFD/Interface.  Using RT(traffic generator) to send
   the traffic to the routers.

   Measurement:

   The DUT must learn all 1,000,000 mac address.Measure the time taken
   to learn 1,000,000 mac in DUT, measure the flood traffic time "T" of
   DUT

5.5.1.  To Scale the DUT to 4k PBB-EVPN instances in DUT with traffic
        and run the set up for 24hrs

   Objective:

   Configure PBB-EVPN instances in R1,MHPE2,DUT.All 4 routers except CE
   are running mpls,bgp,RR is acting as route reflector to R1,MHPE2 and
   DUT.Once the bgp comes up check the DUT evpn table.For MH PE ESI must
   be configured per IFD/Interface.  Using RT(traffic generator) to send
   the traffic to the routers.

   Procedure:


   Measurement:

   Take the hourly reading of CPU,process memory.There should not be any
   leak,crashes,CPU spikes.
