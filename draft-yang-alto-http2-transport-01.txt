                      ALTO Transport using HTTP/2
                   draft-yang-alto-http2-transport-01

Abstract

   The ALTO base protocol [RFC7285] uses HTTP/1.x as the transport
   protocol and hence ALTO transport includes the limitations of
   HTTP/1.x.  ALTO/SSE [RFC8895] addresses some of the limitations, but
   is still based on HTTP/1.x.  This document introduces ALTO/H2, which
   provides the transport of ALTO information resources on top of
   HTTP/2.

1.  Introduction

   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) provides a means for
   network applications to obtain network status information.  The ALTO
   base protocol [RFC7285] is based on the sequential request and
   response model of HTTP/1.1 [RFC7230]; hence, in the base protocol, an
   ALTO client only can issue a sequence of requests on network
   information resources, and the ALTO server sends the information
   resources one-by-one, in the order of the request sequence.

   To address the use cases where an ALTO client may need to efficiently
   monitor changes to a set of network information resources and the
   protocol is still based on the HTTP/1.1 model, the ALTO Working Group
   introduces ALTO/SSE (ALTO Incremental Update based on Server-Sent-
   Event) [RFC8895], so that an ALTO client can manage (i.e., add and
   remove) a set of requests maintained at an ALTO server, and the
   server can continuously, concurrently, and incrementally push updates
   whenever a monitored network information resource changes.  Figure 1
   shows the architecture and message flow of ALTO/SSE, which can be
   considered as a more general transport protocol than the ALTO base
   transport protocol.  Although ALTO/SSE allows the concurrent
   transport of multiple ALTO information resources, it has complexities
   and limitations: (1) it requires that the server provide a separate
   control URI, leading to complexity in management; (2) the data

   connection still suffers HTTP/1.x problems such as head-of-line (HOL)
   blocking.

             Figure 1: ALTO SSE Architecture and Message Flow.

   This document specifies ALTO/H2, based on HTTP/2 [RFC7540].  The
   newer transport can provide multiple benefits:

   o  ALTO based on HTTP/2 natively supports multiple concurrent
      requests pending at the server, realizing a main design goal of
      ALTO SSE.  At the same time, instead of using multiple TCP
      connections (a control connection and a data connection) as ALTO/
      SSE does, ALTO based on HTTP/2 can use a single TCP connection,
      achieving a design with only one connection.

   o  ALTO based on HTTP/2 can take advantage of the benefit provided by
      HTTP/2 to avoid head-of-line blocking in the data connection,
      reducing latency.

   o  ALTO based on HTTP/2 can take advantage of other benefits of
      HTTP/2, including potentially higher encoding efficiency and
      stronger enforcement of security (i.e., using https).

2.  ALTO/H2 Design Requirements

   To realize the functions of ALTO/SSE, there are the following
   requirements:

   o  R0: Client can request any resource using the connection, just as
      using ALTO base protocol using HTTP/1.x.

   o  R1: The client can signal the addition (start) of incremental
      updates to a resource.

   o  R2: The client can signal the deletion (stop) of incremental
      updates to a resource.

   o  R3: The server can signal to the client the start or stop of
      incremental updates to a resource.

   o  R4: The server can choose the type of each incremental update
      endcoding, as long as the type is indicated to be acceptable by
      the client.

   Extending the IRD example in Section 8.1 of [RFC8895], Figure 2 is
   the IRD of an ALTO server supporting ALTO base protocol, ALTO/SSE,

     }

   Note that it is straightforward for an ALTO sever to run HTTP/2 and
   support concurrent retrieval of multiple resources such as "my-
   network-map" and "my-routingcost-map" using multiple HTTP/2 streams
   with the need to introducing ALTO/H2.

   The resource "update-my-costs-h2" provides an ALTO/H2 based
   connection, and this is indicated by the media-type "application/
   alto-h2".  For an ALTO/H2 connection, the client can send in a
   sequence of control requests using media type application/alto-
   updatestreamparams+json.  The server creates HTTP/2 streams and
   pushes updates to the client.

4.  Security Considerations

   The properties defined in this document present no security
   considerations beyond those in Section 15 of the base ALTO
   specification [RFC7285].

5.  ALTO based on HTTP/3 Considerations

   One consideration of the ALTO/H2 design is the pending deployment of
   HTTP3.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will need to register the alto-h2 media type under ALTO registry
   as defined in [RFC7285].

   The authors of this document would also like to thank many for the
