Abstract

   This document recommends the retirement of the CRAM-MD5
   authentication mechanism, and discusses the reasons for doing so.
   This document recommends RFC 2195 and its predecessor, RFC 2095, be
   moved to Historic status.

1. CRAM-MD5

   CRAM-MD5 [RFC2195] is a authentication mechanism.  It was originally
   designed for use in Internet Messaging Access Protocol (IMAP)
   [RFC3501] and Post Office Protocol (POP) [RFC1939].  It is also

Zeilenga & Camara                                               [Page 1]

Internet-Draft            CRAM-MD5 to Historic                 June 2017

   registered as a Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)
   [RFC4422] mechanism [IANA-SASL], though it has not been formally
   specified as SASL mechanism.

   CRAM-MD5 is a simple challenge/response protocol for establishing
   that both parties have knowledge of a shared secret derived from the
   user's password, presumedly a sequence of characters.

   While CRAM-MD5 is widely implemented and deployed on the Internet,
   interoperability is only possible where the client and server have an
   a priori agreement on the character set and encoding of the password,
   and any normalization to be applied before input to the cryptographic
   functions applied by both client and server. Even where the client
   and server are implemented by the same developer, the client and
   server will not operate properly in absence of an a priori agreement
   (such as "passwords shall be a sequence of ASCII printable
   characters, encoded in a octet with zero parity, with no
   normalization").

   CRAM-MD5 does not provide adequate security services for use on the
   Internet.  CRAM-MD5 does not protect the user's authentication
   identifier from eavesdroppers.  CRAM-MD5 challenge/response exchange
   is subject to a number of passive and active attacks.

   CRAM-MD5 does not provide any data security services nor channel
   bindings [RFC5056] to data security services (e.g., TLS [RFC5246])
   provided externally.  Additionally, MD5 is fatally weak [RFC6151] and
   renders CRAM-MD5 completely insecure in today's environment.

   RFC 2195 states no recommendation (or mandate) that implementors only
   offer CRAM-MD5 when external data security services are in place.
   RFC 2195 does not recommend (or mandate) that implementations
   supporting CRAM-MD5 implement any external data security service.

   While it possible to revise RFC 2195 to address these and other
   deficiencies of the authentication mechanism, these changes would be
   disruptive to existing deployments.  For instance, if a revision were
   to specify that a particular character set, encoding, and
   normalization of the password is to be used, this mandate would
   disruptive to deployers who use an incompatible character set,
   encoding, and/or normalization.  Addition of additional security
   features, such as channel bindings, seems more appropriately done by
   introduced in a new mechanism.

2. Recommendations

   It is recommended RFC 2195 and its predecessor, RFC 2095, be moved to
   Historic status.

   It is recommended that application protocol designers and deployers

Internet-Draft            CRAM-MD5 to Historic                 June 2017

   consider the SASL PLAIN [RFC4616] mechanism protected by TLS
   [RFC5246] and/or the SASL Salted Challenge Response Authentication
   Mechanism (SCRAM) [RFC5802] as alternatives to CRAM-MD5.

3. Security Considerations

   The retirement of CRAM-MD5 may lead to use of stronger authentication
   mechanisms and, hence, may improve Internet security.

4. IANA Considerations

   It is requested that IANA update the SASL CRAM-MD5 registration upon
   publication approval of this document.

Appendix A: Notes about -01

   [[Do not change the below note in any revision, but this appendix
   WILL be removed in AUTH48.]]

   ("-00 draft" refers to the 2008 version.)

   The new -00 draft is a revision of the 2008-11-20 -00 draft, that I
   found expired and archived in the IETF Tools website.

   The original draft was posted after November 10, 2008, so I have
   put the RFC 5378 notice at the top of the draft.

   I've replaced references to Internet-Drafts with the RFCs they've
   turned onto (RFC 5802 and RFC 5056, respectively), as Kurt requested
   in the -00 draft.

   I've modernised the header: added "Internet Engineering Task Force

Zeilenga & Camara                                               [Page 4]

   (IETF)", replaced the incorrect phrase "Expires in six months" with
   "Expires December 31, 2017", added "(if approved)" to the Obsoletes
   header, replaced "Category" with "Status" and moved headers around to
   match the header order of a modern (2017-style) Internet-Draft.

   The "Status of this Memo" section was renamed as a minor editorial
   change to "Status of This Memo" (note casing) and was replaced using
   the 2017-style boilerplate.

   The abstract was moved to before the "Status of This Memo".

   A sentence indicating MD5's fatal weaknesses was added to the end of
   the 5th paragraph of Section 1, and an informative reference to
   RFC 6151 was added.

   RFC 2095 and RFC 2195 are normatively referenced in -00, but they
   shouldn't be.  The 2 references were moved to the informative
   references section.  The references were sorted by ASCII/UTF-8 order
   of their names.

   The indenting was changed from 2 to 3 spaces, and I've added myself
   to the author's list.

   There was also a reordering of the sections, correction of the
   numbering, and removal of the "Acknowledgements" section, that
   contained in -00 just "TBD" for almost 9 years.

   The top line of every page except the first was changed to use
   "CRAM-MD5 to Historic" instead of "CRAM-MD5", as this document moves
   CRAM-MD5 to Historic instead of specifying CRAM-MD5.

   Kurt, please update your email and affilliation if they've changed.
   I've revived the draft because it is crucial that RFC 2195 (CRAM-MD5)
   be moved to Historic.

   The draft was taken off the SASL working group because it is
   concluded. The new name is "zeilenga-luis140219-crammd5-to-historic".
