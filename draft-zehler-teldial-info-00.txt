Internet-Draft       Dial String for "tel" URI Scheme         April 2010

   Abstract
   The "tel" URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) for Telephone Numbers
   [RFC3966] describes resources identified by telephone numbers.  These
   resources specify termination points within a public or private
   telephone network. The termination points are a globally or locally
   unique endpoint.  RFC3966 does not address the means by which the
   telephone URI can be used to reach termination point from a specific
   node in the telephone network.

   This document specifies the means by which the termination point is
   reached from a specific node in the telephone network. This document
   specifies how to encode the numbers, symbols and pauses required to
   traverse the phone network to reach the termination point in an RFC
   3966 compliant "tel" URI.

1. Introduction

   The "tel" URI for Telephone Numbers [RFC3966] defines unique
   endpoints in the local or global telephone network.  It is quite
   useful in its own right.  It permits an unambiguous URI for an
   endpoint independent of the means required to traverse the telephone
   network.  This is referred to as the Address-Of-Record.

   There are applications that require additional information to
   connect to the endpoint.  Examples include an individual's address
   book or an address book embedded in a device such as a FAX machine.
   There are instances where pre-dial and/or post-dial information is
   required to not only connect the two telephone devices but also
   specify an account where the cost for the phone call will be
   charged. This is referred to as the Dial String.

   The now obsolete URLs for Telephone Calls [RFC2806] accommodated
   some of this capability.  It allowed post-dial information to be
   explicitly specified.  The pre-dial information had to be hidden in
   the local phone number.  The "tel" URI for Telephone Numbers

Internet-Draft       Dial String for "tel" URI Scheme         April 2010



   [RFC3966] clarified the separation of Dial Strings from the Address-
   Of-Record.

   The purpose of this document is to specify, in an RFC3966 compliant
   fashion, the parameters that encode the pre-dial and post-dial Dial
    Strings.  In a phone call carrying the ITU FAX protocol there are
    mail boxes that can be addressed.  These are referred to as T33
   SubAddressing [T.33].  This document will also specify the parameter
   for T33 SubAddressing.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

   In this document, the characters ">>" preceding an indented line(s)
   indicates a compliance requirement statement using the key words
   listed above. This convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying
   or finding the explicit compliance requirements of this RFC.

2.1. Terminology

   As stated in The "tel" URI for Telephone Numbers [RFC3966],
   telephone numbers comprise two related but distinct concepts:

   Address-Of-Record or identifier: The telephone number is understood
   here as the canonical Address-Of-Record or identifier for a
   termination point within a specific network. For the public network,
   these numbers follow the rules in E.164 [E.164], while private plan.
   numbers follow the rules of the owner of the private numbering
   Subscribers publish these identifiers so that they can be reached,
   regardless of the location of the caller. (Naturally, not all
   numbers are reachable from everywhere, for a variety of technical
   and local policy reasons. Also, a single termination point may be
   reachable from different networks and may have multiple identifiers.)
   variety of technical and local policy reasons.  Also, a single
   termination point may be reachable from different networks and may
   have multiple identifiers.)

Internet-Draft       Dial String for "tel" URI Scheme         April 2010


   Dial string: "Dial strings" are the actual numbers, symbols, and
   pauses entered by a user to place a phone call.  A dial string is
   consumed by one or more network entities and understood in the
   context of the configuration of these entities.  It is used to
   generate an address-of-record or identifier (in the sense described
   above) so that a call can be routed.  Dial strings may require
   prepended digits to exit the private branch exchange (PBX) the end
   system is connected to, and they may include post-dial dual-tone
   multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling that could control an interactive
   voice response (IVR) system or reach an extension.

3. Dial String Parameters

   This document specifies Dial string parameters for the "tel" URI
   scheme. The dial string parameters encode the numbers, symbols and
   pauses required to traverse the phone network to reach an Address-Of-
   Record.  All of these parameters are optional.  Local entities
   SHOULD support these.  Otherwise they MUST be ignored and the
   initiater of the call SHOULD be informed.

   The Dial String parameters defined here are not intended to be
   globally applicable.  They are applicable for a specific telephone
   node enabling it to reach the desired termination point.  For example
   a telephone in companies A and B may both be used to reach a Company
   C as specified by an Address-Of-Record.  Company A may require an '8'
   to be dialed before entering the Address-Of-Record.  Company B may
   not require any such pre-dialing and can reach Comapany C simply by
   dialing the Address-Of-Record.

   Three Dial String parameters are defined here:
   Predial:  The Dial string entered before the Address-Of-Record is
   applied.
   Postdial:  The Dial string entered after the Address-Of-Record is
   applied.
   T33 SubAddress:  A FAX specific Dial string passed through to the FAX
   Protocol component that uses the T33 SubAddress in the FAX protocol
   carried over the telephone connection.

4. Formal Syntax

   The formal syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (BNF) as described in RFC-5234 [RFC5234].

   The following syntax is defined in RFC3966 and is required to define
   the ABNF for the Dial String parameters.

   parameter            = ";" pname ["=" pvalue ]
   pname                = 1*( alphanum / "-" )
   pvalue               = 1*paramchar
   paramchar            = param-unreserved / unreserved / pct-encoded
   unreserved           = alphanum / mark
   mark                 = "-" / "_" / "." / "!" / "~" / "*" /
   alphanum             = ALPHA / DIGIT
   phonedigit           = DIGIT / [ visual-separator ]
   visual-separator     = "-" / "." / "(" / ")"
                          "'" / "(" / ")"
   pct-encoded          = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG
   param-unreserved     = "[" / "]" / "/" / ":" / "&" / "+" / "$"

   The Dial String parameter syntax is described below.  The syntax is
   based on syntax from RFC2806.  Changes have been made to be compliant
   with RFC3966 and to define Dial Strings before the telephone number
   as well as afterwards.

   Dial-string-params    = pre-dial / post-dial / t33-subaddress
   pre-dial              = ";pred=" 1*(phonedigit /
                           dtmf-digit / pause-character)
   post-dial             = ";postd=" 1*(phonedigit /
                           dtmf-digit / pause-character)
   t33-subaddress        = ";tsub=" 1*phonedigit

   pause-character       = one-second-pause / wait-for-dial-tone
   one-second-pause      = "p"
   wait-for-dial-tone    = "w"
   dtmf-digit            = "*" / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / sharp-digit
   sharp-digit            = "%23"

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations include those of the "tel" URI scheme
   [RFC3966].  Those consideration include that applications MUST NOT
   use the URI to place calls without the explicit consent of the user
   of that application.  Placing calls without user consent exposes a
   number of risks including:
   o    The call may incur a cost.
   o    The call will take the user's phone line off hook preventing
        its use by others.
   o    The call can reveal a user's phone number to an attacker.
   o    The URI may be used to place annoying or malicious calls.
   o    URIs embedded in HTML links could hide the true nature of the
        URI

   The use of the Dial Strings introduces some additional security
   concerns.

   o    Dial Strings parameters are locally significant.  Using the Dial
        String parameters in another local telephone network may have
        unintended side effects.
   o    Dial String parameters that include account information and
        SHOULD NOT be publically (i.e. unencrypted) visible to other
        users.

6. IANA Considerations
   The Dial String parameters do not require IANA registration.

7. International Considerations
   The Dial String parameters have no international considerations since
   they consist of numbers, symbols and characters to be consumed by
   automata.
