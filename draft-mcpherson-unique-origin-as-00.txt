1.  Terminology


   This document employs much of the following terminology, which was
   taken in full from Section 2 of [RFC 4786].

    Anycast:  the practice of making a particular Service Address
      available in multiple, discrete, autonomous locations, such that
      datagrams sent are routed to one of several available locations.

    Anycast Node:  an internally-connected collection of hosts and
      routers that together provide service for an anycast Service
      Address.  An Anycast Node might be as simple as a single host
      participating in a routing system with adjacent routers, or it
      might include a number of hosts connected in some more elaborate
      fashion; in either case, to the routing system across which the
      service is being anycast, each Anycast Node presents a unique path
      to the Service Address.  The entire anycast system for the service
      consists of two or more separate Anycast Nodes.

    Catchment:  in physical geography, an area drained by a river, also
      known as a drainage basin.  By analogy, as used in this document,
      the topological region of a network within which packets directed
      at an Anycast Address are routed to one particular node.

    Local-Scope Anycast:  reachability information for the anycast
      Service Address is propagated through a routing system in such a
      way that a particular anycast node is only visible to a subset of
      the whole routing system.

    Local Node:  an Anycast Node providing service using a Local-Scope
      Anycast Address.

    Global Node:  an Anycast Node providing service using a Global-Scope
      Anycast Address.

    Global-Scope Anycast:  reachability information for the anycast
      Service Address is propagated through a routing system in such a
      way that a particular anycast node is potentially visible to the
      whole routing system.

    Service Address:  an IP address associated with a particular service
      (e.g., the destination address used by DNS resolvers to reach a
        particular authority server).

2.  Introduction


   IP anycasting [RFC 4786] has been deployed for an array of network
   services since the early 1990s.  It provides a mechanism for a given
   network resource to be available in a more distributed manner,
   locally and/or globally, with a more robust and resilient footprint,
   commonly yielding better localization and absorption of systemic
   query loads, as well as better protections in the face of DDoS
   attacks, network partitions, and other similar incidents.  A large
   part of the Internet root DNS infrastructure, as well as many other
   resources, has been anycasted for nearly a decade.

   While the benefits realized by anycasting network services is proven,
   some issues do emerge with asserting routing system reachability for
   a common network identifier from multiple locations.  Specifically,
   anycasting in BGP requires injection of reachability information in
   the routing system for a common IP address prefix from multiple
   locations.  These anycasted prefixes and network services have
   traditionally employed a common origin autonomous system number (ASN)
   in order to preserve historically scarce 16-bit AS number space
   utilized by BGP for routing domain identifiers in the global routing
   system. Additionally, a common origin AS number was used in order to
   ease management overhead of resource operations associated with
   acquiring and maintaining multiple discrete AS numbers, as well as to
   avoid triggering various operations- oriented reporting functions
   aimed at identifying "inconsistent origin AS announcements" observed
   in the routing system.  As a result, the representation of routing
   system path attributes associated with those service instances, and
   that anycasted prefix itself, typically bear no per-instance
   discriminators in the routing system (i.e., within the network
   control plane itself).

   Service level query capabilities may or may not provide a mechanism
   to identify which anycast node responded to a particular query,
   although this is likely both service (e.g., DNS or NTP) and
   implementation dependent.  For example, NSD, Unbound, and BIND all
   provide 'hostname.bind or hostname.id' [HNAME] query support that
   enables service-level identification of a given server.  Tools such
   as traceroute are also used to determine which location a given query
   is being routed to, although it may not reveal local-scope anycast
   instances, or if there are multiple servers within a given anycast
   node, which of the servers responded to a given query, in particular
   when multiple servers within an anycast node are connected to a
   single IP router.  When utilizing these service level capabilities,
   query responses are typically both deterministic and inherently
   topology-dependent, however, these service level identifiers at the
   data plane provide no control plane (routing system) uniqueness.



McPherson, et al.                                   Section 2.  [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT             Expires: March 2011            September 2010


   As more services are globally anycasted, and existing anycasted
   services realize wider deployment of anycast nodes for a given
   service address in order to accommodate growing system loads, the
   difficulty of providing safeguards and controls to better protect
   those resources expands.  Intuitively, the more widely distributed a
   given anycasted service address is, the more difficult it becomes for
   network operators to detect operational and security issues that
   affect that service.  Some examples of such security and operational
   issues include BGP route leaks affecting the anycasted service, rogue
   anycast nodes appearing for the service, or the emergence of other
   aberrant behavior in either the routing system, the forward query
   datapath, or query response datapath.  Diagnosis of the routing
   system issues is complicated by the fact that no unique
   discriminators exist in the routing system to identify a given local
   or global anycast node.  Furthermore, both datapath and routing
   system problem identification is compounded by the fact that either
   incident type can be topologically-dependent.

   Additionally, while it goes without saying that anycasted services
   should always strive for exact synchronization across all instances
   of an anycasted service address, if local policies or data plane
   response manipulation techniques were to "influence" responses within
   a given region in such a way that those response are no longer
   authentic or that they diverge from what other nodes within an
   anycasted service were providing, then it should be an absolute
   necessity that those modified resources only be utilized by service
   consumers within that region or influencer's jurisdiction.

   Mechanisms should exist at both the network and service layer to make
   it abundantly apparent to operators and users alike whether any of
   the query responses are not authentic.  For DNS, DNSSEC [RFC 4033]
   provides this capability at the service layer, assuming validation is
   being enforced by recursive name servers, and DNSSEC deployment at
   the root and top level domain (TLD) levels is well underway [DNSSEC-
   DEPLOY].  Furthermore, control plane discriminators should exist to
   enable operators to know toward which of a given set of instances a
   query is being directed, and to enable detection and alerting
   capabilities when this changes.  Such discriminators may also be
   employed to enable anycast node preference or filtering keys, should
   local operational policy require it.




3.  Recommendation for Unique Origin ASNs


   In order to be able to better detect changes to routing information



McPherson, et al.                                   Section 3.  [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT             Expires: March 2011            September 2010


   associated with crtical anycasted resources, globally anycasted
   services with partitioned origin ASNs SHOULD utilize a unique origin
   ASN per node where possible.

   Discrete origin ASNs per node provide a discriminator in the routing
   system that would enable detection of leaked or hijacked instances
   more quickly, and would also enable operators that so choose to
   proactively develop routing policies that express preferences or
   avoidance for a given node or set of nodes associated with an
   anycasted service.  This is particularly useful when it is observed
   that local policy or known issues exist with the performance or
   authenticity of responses returned from a specific anycast node, or
   that enacted policies meant to affect service within a particular
   region are affecting users outside of that region as a result of a
   given anycast catchment expanding beyond its intended scope.

   Furthermore, inconsistent origin AS announcements associated with
   anycasted services for critical infrastructure SHOULD NOT be deemed
   undesirable by routing system reporting functions, but should instead
   be embraced in order to better identify the connectedness and
   footprint of a given anycasted service.

   While namespace conservation and reasonable use of AS number
   resources should always be a goal, the introduction of 32-bit ASNs
   significantly lessens concerns in this space.  Globally anycasted
   resources, in particular those associated with critical
   infrastructure-enabling services such as root and TLD name servers,
   SHOULD warrant special consideration with regard to AS number
   allocation practices during policy development by the constituents of
   those responsible organizations (e.g., the Regional Internet
   Registries).  Additionally, defining precisely what constitutes
   "critical infrastructure services" or "special consideration" (e.g.,
   some small range of 32-bit AS numbers might be provided) is left to
   the constituents of those organizations.  Additionally, critical
   infrastructure employment of 32-bit ASNs for new nodes might well
   help to foster adoption of native 32-bit ASN support by network
   operators.

   One additional benefit of unique origin AS numbers per anycast node
   is that Resource PKI (RPKI) Secure Inter-domain Routing [SIDR]
   machinery, and in particular, that of Route Origin Authorizations
   (ROAs), and routing policies that may be derived based on those ROAs,
   can be employed with per anycast node resolution, rather than relying
   on a single ROA and common origin AS to cover all instantiations of
   an anycasted prefix (possibly hundreds) within the global routing
   system.  For example, deployments that incorporate partitioned ASN
   anycast models that have a single ASN bound to all nodes but cross
   organizational or political boundaries, a situation may arise where



McPherson, et al.                                   Section 3.  [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT             Expires: March 2011            September 2010


   nobody would be deemed appropriate to hold the key for the ROA.
   Additionally, a globally anycasted service within a given IP prefix
   that shares a common ASN might be taken totally offline because of
   the revocation of a ROA for that origin.




4.  Additional Recommendations for Globally Anycasted Services


   Two additional recommendations for globally anycasted critical
   infrastructure services are related to publication of information
   associated with a given node's physical location, and which adjacent
   upstream ASNs an origin AS interconnects with.  The former would
   allow operators to better define and optimize preferences associated
   with a given node to align with local policy and service
   optimizations.  The latter would allow expression though policy such
   as Routing Policy Specification Language [RFC 4012] specified in
   Internet Routing Registries (IRRs) in a manner that illustrates a
   discrete set of upstream ASNs for each anycast node, rather than the
   current model where all upstream ASNs associated with a common origin
   AS may or may not be expressed.  This information would provide an
   additional level of static AS path validation or monitoring and
   detection models by network operators, and perhaps explicit network
   layer source address validation in the datapath.



5.  Security Considerations


   The recommendations made in this memo aim to provide more flexibility
   for network operators hoping to better monitor and prevent issues
   related to globally anycasted critical infrastructure resources.
   Anycast itself provides considerable benefit in the face of certain
   attacks, yet if a given instance of a service can appear at many
   points in the routing system and legitimate instances are difficult
   to distinguish from malicious ones, then anycast expands the
   service's attack surface rather than reducing it.

   The recommendations made in this document are expressed to assist
   with visibility and policy specification capabilities in order to
   improve the availability of critical Internet resources.  Use cases
   where the recommendations outlined in this memo may have helped to
   more easily detect or scope the impact of a particular incident are
   illustrated in [RENESYS-BLOG].




McPherson, et al.                                   Section 5.  [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT             Expires: March 2011            September 2010


   Furthermore, while application layer protection mechanisms such as
   DNSSEC provide integrity and authentication, they often do so at the
   cost of introducing more failure conditions.  For example, if a
   recursive name server is performing DNSSEC validator functions and
   receives a bogus response to a given query as a result of a man-in-
   the-middle (MITM) or injected spoofed response packet such as a cache
   poisoning attempt, the possibility might exist that that packet is
   processed by the server and results in some temporal or persistent
   DoS condition.  The unique origin AS mechanism outlined in this
   document provides the capability for network operators to expressly
   avoid anycast node catchments known to regularly elicit bogus
   responses, while allowing the anycasted service address to remain
   available otherwise.




6.  Deployment Considerations


   Maintenance of unique ASNs for each node within an anycasted service
   may be challenging for some critical infrastructure service operators
   initially, but for globally anycasted resources there needs to be
   some type of discriminator in the control plane to enable detection,
   remediation, and optimally, preventative controls for dealing with
   routing system anomalies that are intensified by the application of
   anycast.  Additionally, this technique sets the stage to employ RPKI-
   enabled machinery and more secure and explicit routing policies,
   which all operators should be considering.

   The granularity of data publication related to anycast node location
   should be left to the devises of each services operator, but some
   reasonable level of detail to inform operators as outlined herein
   should be provided by each critical services operator.

   Adjacent AS information for a given origin AS can be obtained through
   careful routing system analysis already and should present no new
   threat.  However, network interconnection and peering policies may
   well present some challenges in this area.  That said,
   interconnection with networks that provide critical infrastructure
   services should certainly be given due consideration as such by
   network operators when evaluating interconnection strategies.

   Some root and TLD operators today identify erroneous anycast prefix
   announcements by detecting prefix announcements with an origin AS
   other than the common origin AS shared via all nodes.  This detection
   model would need to be expanded to account for unique origin ASNs per
   node, and given that AS paths are trivial to manipulate, the above



McPherson, et al.                                   Section 6.  [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT             Expires: March 2011            September 2010


   technique would only assist in the event of unintentional
   configuration errors that reoriginate the route (e.g., it doesn't
   even detect leaks that preserve the initial path elements)..

   Finally, anycast node presence at exchange points that employs route
   servers may make enumeration of adjacent ASNs for a given node
   challenging.  While this is understood, service operators should make
   every effort to enumerate the set of adjacent ASNs associated with a
   given anycast node's origin AS.
