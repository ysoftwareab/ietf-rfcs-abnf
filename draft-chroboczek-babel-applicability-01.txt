1.  Introduction

   Babel [RFC6126] is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol
   that aims to be robust in a variety of environments.

   This document describes a few areas where Babel has been found to be
   useful.  It is structured as follows.  In Section 2, we describe
   application areas where Babel has been successfully deployed.  In
   Section 3, we describe application areas where Babel works well, but
   has not been widely deployed yet.  In Section 4, we describe
   application areas where deployment of Babel is not encouraged because
   better alternatives are available.

2.  Existing successful deployments of Babel

2.1.  Hybrid networks

   Babel is able to deal with both classical, prefix-based ("Internet-
   style") routing and flat ("mesh-style") over non-transitive link
   technologies.  Because of that, it has seen a number of succesful
   deployments in medium-sized hybrid networks, networks that combine a
   wired, aggregated backbone with meshy wireless bits at the edges.  No
   other routing protocol known to us is similarly robust and efficient
   in this particular type of network.

2.2.  Large scale overlay networks

   The algorithms used by Babel (loop avoidance, hysteresis, delayed
   updates) allow it to remain stable and efficient in the presence of
   unstable metrics, even in the presence of a feedback loop.  For this
   reason, it has been successfully deployed in large scale overlay
   networks, built out of thousands of tunnels spanning continents,

   where it is used with a metric computed from links' latencies
   [DELAY-BASED].

2.3.  Small unmanaged networks

   Because of its small size and simple configuration, Babel has been
   deployed in small, unmanaged networks (three to five routers), where
   it serves as a more efficient replacement for RIP [RFC2453], albeit
   with good support for wireless links.

3.  Potential deployments of Babel

   There are application areas for which Babel is a good fit, but where
   it has not seen major deployments yet.

3.1.  Pure mesh networks

   Babel has been repeatedly shown to be competitive with dedicated
   routing protocols for wireless mesh networks [REAL-WORLD]
   [BRIDGING-LAYERS].  However, this particular niche is already served
   by a number of mature protocols, notably OLSR-ETX as well as OLSRv2
   [RFC7181] equipped with the DAT metric [DAT], so Babel has not seen
   major deployments in pure meshes yet.

4.  Application Areas where Babel is not recommended

   There are a number of application areas where Babel is a poor fit.

4.1.  Large, stable networks

   Babel relies on periodic updates, and even in a stable network, it
   generates a constant amount of background traffic.  In large, stable,
   well-administered networks, it is preferable to use protocols layered
   above a reliable transport mechanism, such as OSPF [RFC5340], EIGRP
   [EIGRP] or IS-IS [RFC1195].

4.2.  Low-power networks

   Babel relies on periodic updates and maintains within each node an
   amount of state that is proportional to the number of reachable
   destinations.  In networks containing resource-constrained or
   exteremely low-power nodes, it may be preferable to use a protocol
   that limits the amount of state maintained and propagated; we have
   heard of AODVv2 [AODVv2], RPL [RFC6550] and LOADng [LOADng].
