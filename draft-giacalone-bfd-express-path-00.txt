           Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) Express Path
                  draft-giacalone-bfd-express-path-00.txt




Abstract

   In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial
   information networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network
   performance criteria (e.g. latency) have become (or are becoming) as
   (or more) critical to data path selection than other metrics.

   This document describes extensions to the BFD protocol, such that
   network performance information can be gathered in a scalable
   fashion, and subsequently used (by other protocols) to make path
   selection decisions. These extensions will also provide granular
   performance monitoring information.

1. Introduction

   In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial
   information networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network
   performance information (e.g. latency) have (or are becoming) as (or
   more) critical to data path selection than other metrics. In many of
   these networks, bandwidth is relatively rich and homogeneous (e.g. a
   WAN core network of all 10 or 20 Gigabit Ethernet links, or greater),
   however path length (and therefore latency) can vary in between
   nodes, and can even change based on the path protection scheme used.
   In these networks, extremely large amounts of money rest on the
   ability to make trades faster than the competition, and the ability
   to access real time market data. In certain financial services
   networks, hop count, cost, and bandwidth are only tangentially
   important. Rather, it would be beneficial to be able to granularly
   monitor network performance and/or make path selection decisions
   based on performance data (such as latency) in a cost-effective and
   scalable way.

   Many performance sensitive networks have already implemented BFD
   [RFC5880] to improve convergence time. This document describes
   extensions to the BFD protocol (hereafter called "BFD Express Path"),
   that can be used to derive latency (and other performance
   information). BFD Express Path can provide performance data for every
   link or path where BFD is enabled. BFD Express Path is open,
   scalable, and provides a number of benefits:

     o  Once BFD Express Path gathers latency information, it could
        subsequently be distributed using extensions to existing
        routing protocols, such as OSPF [RFC2328] and OSPF-TE
        [RFC3630]. In this scenario, BFD Express Path would be used
        with BFD on a link-by-link basis [RFC5881]. Using this link-by-
        link data, end-to-end path selection can be performed based on
        latency metrics, as part of the normal operation of various
        routing protocols (e.g. by replacing cost with latency) or by
        using "second order" control plane protocols such as CSPF,
        RSVP-TE [RFC3209], etc.

Internet-Draft             BFD Express Path               November 2010


        Note that routing protocol extensions are out of the scope of
        this document, and will be covered elsewhere.

        Although this document focuses on latency, there is no reason
        why implementations of BFD Express Path cannot be used to
        gather jitter and loss information. Note, however, that with
        respect to path selection protocol interactions and support,
        this document only focuses on latency.

     o  Since BFD Express Path operates between pairs of nodes, it can
        create a scalable, open mechanism for link-by-link SLA
        compliance monitoring, which is an important issue in large,
        diverse networks that use transport services from various
        providers. In networks like this, end-to-end latency is not
        always useful for SLA enforcement (since various links from
        different providers may make up a path). This link-by-link
        performance monitoring data could easily be gathered by looking
        at a routing protocol's state database (on any router in an
        area, depending on what is being monitoring and disseminated by
        the routing protocol), using SNMP [RFC1441] on a per device
        basis, or in other ways.

     o  In addition to looking at link-by-link latency, BFD Express
        Path can also be used to understand overall path latency (or
        other parameters). To do this, BFD Multihop [RFC5883] could be
        used to take measurements directly, or more simply, the
        topology database from any device participating in an extended
        routing protocol that distributes BFD Express Path information
        could be consulted. Using this information, it would be
        possible to bring links or MPLS TE tunnels out of service (if
        needed, based perhaps on SLA), reroute traffic, or take other
        actions. This is particularly useful in networks or scenarios
        where an end-to-end service that breaches an SLA (like a
        latency SLA) is considered "down", even though the network
        forwarding and control planes are both "up".

     o  In addition to enhanced routing and SLA management, BFD Express
        Path's link-by-link or end-to-end network performance
        information can be used to enable threshold based alerting
        (network management) in a cost-effective and scalable fashion.
        In large, diverse financial networks, it is critical to know
        when performance (e.g. latency) between nodes, points, or
        services varies.

     o  BFD Express Path is simple to deploy, easy to monitor, and
        scalable to provision. It is low cost, integrated with existing
        protocols, and does not require expensive tools, hardware, or

        systems. BFD Express Path provides link-local and end-to-end
        functionality and is an open protocol for performance and
        latency based monitoring, analysis, and routing.



2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.



3. Express Path Extensions to BFD

   The main change BFD Express Path makes to BFD [RFC5880] is the
   addition of timestamp fields. The basic structure and intent of these
   timestamps are similar to ICMP Timestamp [RFC792]. The format of
   these fields, relative to the basic BFD control packet will be
   explained in sections 4 and 5.

   To support BFD Express path, it is also proposed that 2 new
   diagnostic codes [RFC5880] be assigned. The first diagnostic code
   indicates that the sender is using BFD Express Path. The second
   indicates whether the sender is synchronizing clock to a clock
   synchronization protocol (e.g. NTP [RFC1305]) source. The first code
   (hereafter called the "Express Path" bit) is required to delimit and
   differentiation the packet extensions. The second code (hereafter
   called the "clock sync" bit) ensures that similar clock accuracy is
   used between systems.

   Note that because of the limitations of NTP with respect to clock
   accuracy, this document does not preclude the use of other time
   synchronization protocols, which may provide more accurate
   synchronization. The use of other clock synchronization protocols may
   have implications on the diagnostics codes assigned, however.

4. Originating BFD Express Path Packets

   When originating a BFD Express Path Control packet, the sender MUST
   append the "Originate Timestamp" field to the normal BFD Control
   packet [RFC5880], as shown below. In the diagram below, the first 24
   bytes of the BFD packet are left unchanged from [RFC5880], except for
   the assignment of new diagnostic codes, adjustment of the packet
   "length" field to account for the appended field, and the new
   timestamp field itself:

4.1. Diagnostic Codes

   As detailed in section 3, it is proposed that 2 new BFD diagnostic
   codes be assigned for BFD Express Path. The first diagnostic code
   indicates that the sender is using BFD Express Path. The second
   indicates whether the sender is synchronizing clock to a clock
   synchronization source. The first code is required to delimit and

   differentiation and the packet extensions. The second code ensures
   that similar clock accuracy is used between systems.


4.2. Length

   This field specifies the length of the BFD Control packet, in bytes
   as per [RFC5880]. In this case, the length would be 32.



4.3. Reserved

   A 16 bit field, reserved for future use



4.4. Originate Timestamp Field

   The Originate Timestamp field is 48 bits in length. The exact format
   and range of values in the field is TBD. Whatever format is decided,
   it is recommended that it permit accuracy to the microsecond (uS).

   As in ICMP Timestamp [RFC792], the time value in this field MUST
   represent the time the sender last touched the message before sending
   it.

   Whether or not this timestamp is fixed to some reference time value,
   such a midnight, as in ICMP Timestamp [RFC792], or relative to a
   local clock (likely using NTP) is TBD. Space has been allocated to
   support a reference value in ms (as per [RFC792], plus the uS
   increment since the last ms "tick". If more efficient encodings are
   agreed, this field may be shortened in future draft revisions.



5. BFD Express Path Response Packets

   When responding to a BFD Express Path Control packet, the responding
   system MUST append the "Receive Timestamp" and the "Transmit
   Timestamp" fields to the BFD Express Path packet, unless BFD
   Asynchronous Mode [RFC5880], is being used and the "Poll" (P) Bit
   [RFC5880] is cleared. By removing the requirement for additional
   timestamps in pure Asynchronous Mode, packet length is reduced, and
   protocol efficiency is increased.

5.1. Diagnostic Codes

   The assignment of diagnostic codes for BFD Express Path is outlined
   in 3. Note that the responding system MUST set the diagnostic codes
   according to the setting of the local system. In other words, if the
   originator has the NTP bit set, but the responder does have NTP
   enabled, the responder MUST clear the NTP bit.

5.2. Length

   This field specifies the length of the BFD Control packet, in bytes
   [RFC5880]. In this case, the length would be 44.



5.3. Reserved

   A 16 bit field, reserved for future use



5.4. Receive Timestamp Field

   The receive timestamp field is a 48 bits in length. The exact format
   and range of values in the field is TBD. Whatever format is decided,
   it is recommended that it permit accuracy to the microsecond (uS).

   As in ICMP Timestamp [RFC792], the Receive Timestamp is the time the
   responding system first touched the BFD Express Path Packet on
   receipt.

   Whether or not this timestamp is fixed to some reference time value,
   such a midnight, as in ICMP Timestamp [RFC792], or relative to a
   local clock (likely using NTP) is TBD. Space has been allocated to
   support a reference value in ms (as per [RFC792], plus the uS
   increment since the last ms "tick". If more efficient encodings are
   agreed, this field may be shortened in future draft revisions.



5.5. Transmit Timestamp Field

   The transmit timestamp field is a 48 bits in length. These exact
   format and range of values in the field is TBD. Whatever format is
   decided, it is recommended that it permit accuracy to the microsecond
   (uS).

   As in ICMP Timestamp [RFC792], the Transmit Timestamp is the time the
   responding system last touched the message on sending it.

   Whether or not this timestamp is fixed to some reference time value,
   such a midnight, as in ICMP Timestamp [RFC792], or relative to a
   local clock (likely using NTP) is TBD. Space has been allocated to

   support a reference value in ms (as per [RFC792], plus the uS
   increment since the last ms "tick". If more efficient encodings are
   agreed, this field may be shortened in future draft revisions.



6. BFD Mode Support

   All implementations of BFD Express Path MUST support Asynchronous
   mode BFD with NTP (at a minimum) as the clock source.

   When other BFD modes (e.g. Echo, Demand, Poll Request, etc) are
   supported by the BFD implementation, it is RECOMMENDED that BFD
   Express Path be supported for the other BFD modes as well.

   Implementations that support Multihop BFD [RFC5883] SHOULD also
   support BFD Express Path, Multihop BFD.



7. Error Detection

   If the local system has the BFD Express Path bit set in the diag code
   field, and the remote system does not, an error MUST be generated, as
   this could lead to an inconsistent topology database, if and when
   latency information is used for path selection.

   If the local system has the Clock Sync bit set in the diag code
   field, and the remote system does not, an error SHOULD be generated.

   Whether or not either of these errors affect the state of the BFD
   session (i.e. bring it down) is OPTIONAL and implementation specific,
   however is it RECOMMENDED that this be configurable.



8. Latency, Jitter, and Loss

   Implementations of BFD Express Path MUST support latency monitoring.
   Implementations MAY also support jitter and loss monitoring. The
   exact algorithms for performing this monitoring and analysis are
   implementation specific.

Internet-Draft             BFD Express Path               November 2010


9. Sampling and Monitoring

   The exact frequency with which BFD Express Path measurements are
   taken,  the sampling mechanisms used, the averaging algorithms used,
   and the amount of trending data stored are implementation specific,
   and are out of the scope of this document.

   Implementations are encouraged to use "common sense" averaging
   frequencies for monitoring (e.g. a 30 second average, 1 minute
   average, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, etc). However, note that from a
   practitioner's perspective, the capability to sample at more granular
   intervals and the ability to store more trending data are generally
   considered good things, and implementers are encouraged to consider
   advantages in this area a competitive differentiator.

   It also is RECOMMENDED that implementations permit latency
   measurements to be taken at any particular time (i.e. a snapshot in
   time).

   No matter the sampling and averaging frequencies used,
   implementations MUST permit configuration of sampling or averaging
   timers such that users can configure how subsequent path selection
   algorithms will respond to changes in the performance of the network.



10. Dissemination of Latency Information

   The need to gather BFD Express Path data is critical. It would make
   sense to expose a MIB Variable(s) to do this; however, MIB extensions
   are currently outside the scope of this document.

   The injection of BFD Express Path information into routing protocols
   is an important application of BFD Express Path, and will be
   addressed outside the scope of this document.



11. Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in [BFD], [BFD-1HOP] apply to this
   document.

12. IANA Considerations

   BFD Express Path will require 2 Diagnostic Codes to be assigned as
   per section 3. In addition, 3 new fields will be added to the BFD
   [RFC5880] packet; the Originate Timestamp, the Receive Timestamp, and
   the Transmit Timestamp.
