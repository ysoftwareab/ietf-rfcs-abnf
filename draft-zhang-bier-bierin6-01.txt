1.  Introduction

   BIER [RFC8279] is a new architecture for the forwarding of multicast
   data packets.  It provides optimal forwarding through a "multicast
   domain' and it does not necessarily precondition construction of a
   multicast distribution tree, nor does it require intermediate nodes
   to maintain any per-flow state.

   [RFC8296] defines the BIER encapsulation format in MPLS and non-MPLS
   environment that rely on MPLS labels or special ethernet type
   support.  In pure IPv6 environments a BIER packet could be forwarded
   by means of simple IPv6 hop-by-hop processing only, without any new
   hardware support.  Ultimate hardware support is obviously possible
   but the encapsulation is especially interesting for environments like
   [RFC7368] where high throughput multicast forwarding performance is
   not decisive and could be initially done in slow-path or end host
   (assuming last-hop being IPv6 encapsulated).

   This document defines native BIER IPv6 [RFC2460] encapsulation we
   call BIERv6.  This encapsulation is aligned with the format defined
   in [RFC8296] for a non-mpls version.

   This document uses terminology defined in [RFC8279].

2.  IPv6 Header

   The BIER packet itself is the payload of an IPv6 frame.  The
   destination address field in IPv6 packet MAY be the neighbor's link-
   local or one of the loopback interface addresses of that neighbor.
   The destination address SHOULD be the BFR-prefix advertised by IGP/

   BGP extensions for BIER.  TTL value of 1 MUST be used on the IPv6
   packet.

   The source address field in IPv6 packet MAY be the loopback interface
   address of the sending BFIR.  The address SHOULD be the BFR-prefix
   advertised in IGP/BGP extension.

   A new next-protocol type in IPv6 Next header field of TBD indicates
   the following BIER packet.

   The Flow-ID in the IPv6 packet SHOULD be copied from the entropy
   field in the BIER encapsulation.

3.  BIER Header

   S bit in BIER header has no significance in this environment.  It
   should be set to 1 upon transmission, but it MUST be ignored upon
   reception.

   TC bits in BIER header have no significance in this environment since
   the IPv6 packet TC takes precedence on processing.  It should be set
   to zero upon transmission, but it MUST be ignored upon reception.

   The BIFT-id is used to indicate the combination of <SD, SI, BSL>
   normally; it should be set to the value advertised by the next-hop
   BFR through e.g.  IGP [I-D.ietf-bier-ospf-bier-extensions],
   [I-D.zhang-bier-babel-extensions] or BGP
   [I-D.ietf-bier-idr-extensions] extension for BIER.

   The remaining fields defined in BIER header MUST assume the same
   values and be afforded same treatement as specified in [RFC8296].

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to set up a new type of "Next header" registry
   value for BIERv6 in the "Assigned Internet Protocol Numbers"
   registry.

5.  Security Considerations

   General IPv6 and BIER security considerations apply.
