Abstract

   This document defines a mechanism to enable a wireless client to
   discover roaming partners of an access network over EAP.  The purpose

   is to help a wireless client select the most appropriate roaming
   partner as a next hop for routing of AAA packets.  This solution is
   especially useful in roaming scenarios where the access network does
   not have a direct relationship with the wireless client's home
   network - i.e., when AAA packets can not be directly routed from
   access network to the home network.

1.  Introduction

   In wireless network access, the high level network topology is
   comprised of access networks, mediating networks, and home networks
   as depicted in Figure 1.  RADIUS [2] protocol has been assumed for
   AAA mediation between the access network and the home network
   although Diameter [3] could also be used instead of RADIUS without
   introducing significant architectural differences.

             Figure 1.  Network Access Arrangement.

   In roaming situations, EAP authentication exchanges [5] will be
   carried out between the wireless client in the access network and an
   AAA server in the home network directly when the two networks have a
   direct roaming relationship.  However when a wireless client roams to
   an access network that it does not recognize and which does not have
   a direct roaming relationship with its home network, the AAA packets
   have to be routed through a mediating AAA network to the home
   network.  For inter operator settlement reasons, it is necessary to
   select the best mediating network.  For instance, in Figure 2, access

   through the Mediating Network 1 may be cheaper for isp1 user, than if
   Mediating Network 2 is used.  However this decision can not be made
   by the access network as it would be unaware of the roaming
   agreements of mediating networks 1 and 2 with the isp1.  For this
   reason, it is desirable for the wireless client to know which
   mediating networks are available through an access network, and
   influence the decision of using the desired mediating network.

                Figure 2: Ambiguous AAA routing


   Influencing the mediating network selection problem can be divided
   into three sub-problems as follows:

   1.  A syntax by which mediating network information can be
       represented.

   2.  A delivery mechanism by which mediating network information is
       conveyed to a wireless client.

   3.  A general mechanism by which a wireless client's selection can be
       conveyed to the access network.

   Section 2.7 of [6] discusses the conditions upon which NAIs can be
   used to affect AAA routing, i.e., problem 3 above.  Problems 1 and 2
   are discussed in this document.

1.1  Applicability

   Although the proposed solution here is discussed in the context of
   public 802.11 access network deployment, it is applicable to other
   public wireless access networks where the wireless clients use the
   EAP specification framework [5] for authentication, and they present
   their identity to the network in NAI [6] format.

Internet-Draft           EAP Network Discovery                 June 2004


1.2  Terminology

   Network Access Identifier (NAI)
           An identifier that represents a wireless client or user
           identity.  The basic structure of a NAI is user@realm, where
           the realm part of the NAI indicates the domain responsible
           for interpretation and resolution of the user name.  Please
           See [6] for more details on NAI format.

   Access Point (AP)
           A station that provides access to the distribution services
           via the wireless medium for associated Stations.

   RADIUS server
           This is a server which provides for authentication/
           authorization via the protocol described in [2].


2.  Data Model

   Mediating network information needs to be structured in a general
   format and syntax so that the EAP client software can interpret it
   and behave accordingly.  The syntax should have minimum overhead
   because the proposed delivery mechanism (i.e., EAP-Identity Request)
   doesn't support fragmentation and therefore size of the data is
   limited by the link layer MTU.

   Mediating network information is placed after the displayable string
   and NULL in the EAP-Identity Request.  It is structured as a set of
   comma-separated attribute names and values according to the following
   ABNF [1]:


      identity-request-data = displayable-string [ %d0 network-info ]
      displayable-string = *CHAR

      network-info = attribute "=" value

      attribute =  1*( ALPHA / "-" / "_" / DIGIT)

      value = 1*( %x01-2B / %x2D-FF ) ; any non-null UTF-8 char except ","

   The CHAR, DIGIT, ALPHA terminals are defined in [1].

   Only one attribute is defined here, the NAIRealms attribute.  The use
   of this facility for other purposes is discouraged due to the limited
   amount of space available in EAP packets.

Internet-Draft           EAP Network Discovery                 June 2004


   The format and semantics of the NAIRealms attribute value are as
   follows:

       value = Realm [ ";" Realm ]


   Where the Realm is defined in [6].

   An example "NAIRealms" attribute is shown below:

       NAIRealms=anyisp.com;mnc123.mcc334.3gppnetwork.org


3.  Delivery Mechanism

   There are three possible options of delivering mediating network
   information to a wireless client by using an EAP-Identity Request.
   These options are:

   Option 1 -  Use the Initial EAP-Identity Request issued by the access
   network NAS

      Mediating network information is pushed to a wireless client in
      the initial EAP-Identity Request issued by the AP.

   Option 2 - Use the initial EAP-Identity Request issued by the access
   network RADIUS server

      This is similar to Option 1, but the initial EAP-Identity Request
      is issued by the access network RADIUS Server instead.  Once a
      wireless client associates with an access network AP using native
      IEEE 802.11 procedures, the AP sends an EAP-Start message [4]
      within a RADIUS Access-Request to trigger an EAP conversation
      initiated by the access network RADIUS server.

   Option 3 - Use a subsequent EAP-Identity Request issued by the access
   network RADIUS server

      Mediating network information is delivered to a wireless client in
      a subsequent EAP-Identity request, after the initial EAP-Identity
      Request/Response exchange, issued by by the access network RADIUS
      server.


4.  Implementation Considerations

   - In general, an option that requires changes only to a central AAA
   server is much preferred than a one that impacts a distributed set of



Adrangi, et al.        Expires December 16, 2004                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           EAP Network Discovery                 June 2004


   APs.  The reasons for this preference include ease of operation and
   deployment, update costs, backwards compatibility and possible impact
   on current standards.  Option 3 is therefore preferred as it does not
   require any changes to the AP.  Option 2 is also equally desirable if
   the AP supports the EAP-Start message [4].

   - In order for a wireless client software implementation to work with
   all options transparently, the implementation MUST not require the
   arrival of mediating network information on a particular EAP-Identity
   Request (i.e., the initial or a subsequent Request).  Access network
   operators therefore MAY choose to deploy any of the above delivery
   mechanism options in their network without losing interoperability.
   However, delivery mechanism options 2 and 3 are recommended as they
   are backward-compatible with the currently-deployed APs.

   - When Option 3 is used, upon receipt of a RADIUS Access-Request
   packet containing the initial EAP-Identity Response, the access
   network RADIUS proxy/server MAY send an EAP-Identity Request
   containing mediating network information to the wireless client if it
   cannot route the RADIUS packet to the next AAA hop based on the realm
   portion (i.e., string after the @ sign) of the NAI in the RADIUS
   User-Name attribute.  When a RADIUS Access-Request containing a
   subsequent EAP-Identity Response is received, if the RADIUS proxy/
   server still cannot route the RADIUS packet to the next AAA hop based
   on the realm portion of the NAI, then it MUST discard the packet.

   - The use of the mechanism described in this document SHOULD be
   reserved for situations where the WLAN client can not identify a
   direct route to its home network based on the available SSIDs in the
   hotspot.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not define a new name space, therefore, there are
   no considerations for IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   Mediating network information delivered inside an EAP-Identity
   Request before the user authenticates to the network.  Therefore, it
   is considered as a hint in guiding the wireless client to select the
   desired mediating network through which the AAA packets should be
   routed.

   It should also be noted that at least with some EAP methods, there is
   no way for the home network RADIUS server to verify that the
   mediating network used was actually the same one that the wireless
   client had requested.

   2.  The wireless client sends an EAP-Identity Response containing a
       Decorated NAI indicating the selected MN to the AP.  OR,

   3.  The wireless client sends an EAP-Identity Response containing a
       normal NAI (i.e., non-decorated)to the AP.

   4.  The AP sends a RADIUS Access Request packet containing the
       EAP-Identity Response to the access network RADIUS proxy/server
       as described in [4].  Please note that NAI in the EAP-Identity
       Response is copied to the RADIUS User-Name attribute in the
       Access-Request packet as per [4].

   5.  The access network RADIUS proxy/server forwards the received
       Access-Request packet to the next AAA hop based on the realm
       portion of the NAI in the RADIUS User-Name attribute.

   6.  The MN RADIUS proxy/server forwards the received Access-Request
       packet based on the NAI in the RADIUS User-Name attribute to the
       next AAA hop (i.e., HN RADIUS Server).

   7.  The EAP Authentication continues as described in [4].

   Option 2 - Use the initial EAP-Identity Request issued by the access
   network RADIUS server.

   The following describes each message flow in details.

   1.  The wireless client associates with the AP.

   2.  An EAP-Start message encapsulated within a RADIUS Access-Request
        sent to the access network RADIUS server.

   3.  The access network RADIUS server processes the received
        Access-Request message and initiates an EAP conversation by
        sending an EAP-Identity Request containing mediating network
        information encapsulated within a RADIUS Access-Challenge.

   4.  The AP extracts the EAP-Identity Request from the received
        Access-Challenge and sends it to the wireless client.

   5.  The wireless client sends an EAP-Identity Response containing its
        decorated NAI indicating the selected MN to the AP.  OR,

   6.  The wireless client sends an EAP-Identity Response containing a
        normal NAI (i.e., non-decorated) to the AP.

   7.  The AP sends a RADIUS Access-Request packet containing the

   The following describes each message flow in details.

   1.  The access network AP issues an EAP-Identity Request to a
       wireless client

   2.  The wireless client replies with an EAP-Identity Response
       containing a normal NAI (i.e., non-decorated), or perhaps a
       Decorated NAI [6] based on the mediating network information
       cached from the most recent authentication session to the access
       network.

   3.  The AP creates a RADIUS Access-Request packet encapsulating the
       EAP-Identity Response and sends it to the access network RADIUS
       server.

   4.  The access network RADIUS proxy/server sends a RADIUS
       Access-Challenge packet encapsulating an EAP-Identity Request
       containing mediating network information.  Or, the step 8 is
       executed if the access network proxy/server can route the packet
       based on the realm portion of the NAI in the RADIUS User-Name
       attribute to the next AAA hop.

   5.  The access network AP forwards the EAP-Identity Request
       containing the mediating network information to the wireless
       client.

   6.  The wireless client replies with an EAP-Identity Response
       containing a Decorated NAI indicating the preferred MN.  Wireless
       client can still send an undecorated NAI to the RADIUS proxy/
       server, if it is a legacy client.  It should also be noted that
       the wireless client may also decide not to connect to the access
       network in the absence of the desired MN in the received MN
       information in step (4).

   7.  The access network AP forwards the EAP-Identity Response to the
       access network RADIUS server over RADIUS protocol.

   8.  The access network RADIUS proxy/server forwards the received
       Access Request to the appropriate MN RADIUS server based on the
       realm portion of the NAI in the RADIUS User-Name attribute.

   9.  The MN RADIUS proxy/server forwards the received Access-Request

       packet based on the NAI in the RADIUS User-Name attribute  to the
       next AAA hop (i.e., HN RADIUS Server).  The EAP Authentication
       continues as described in [4].
