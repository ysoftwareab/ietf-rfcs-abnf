       Satellite Semantic Addressing for Satellite Constellation
              draft-lhan-satellite-semantic-addressing-01

Abstract

   This document presents a semantic addressing method for satellites in
   satellite constellation connecting with Internet.  The satellite
   semantic address can indicate the relative position of satellites in
   a constellation.  The address can be used with traditional IP address
   or MAC address or used independently for IP routing and switching.

1.  Introduction

   Satellite constellation technologies for Internet are emerging and
   expected to provide Internet service like the traditional wired
   network on the ground.  A typical satellite constellation will have
   couple of thousands or over ten thousand of LEO and/or VLEO.
   Satellites in a constellation will be connected to adjacent
   satellites by Inter-Satellite-Links (ISL), and/or connected to ground
   station by microwave or laser links.  ISL is still in research stage
   and will be deployed soon.  This memo is for the satellite networking
   with the use of ISL.

   The memo proposes to use some indexes to represent a satellite's
   orbit information.  The indexes can form satellite semantic address,
   the address can then be embedded into IPv6 address or MAC address for
   IP routing and switching.  The address can also be used independently
   if the shorter than 128-bit length of IP address is accepted.  As an
   internal address for satellite network, it only applies to satellites
   that will form a constellation to transport Internet traffic between
   ground stations and will not be populated to Internet by BGP.

                     Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP
                     [RFC7868]).

3.  Overview

   For IP based satellite networking, the topology is very dynamic and
   the traditional IGP and BGP based routing technologies will face
   challenges according to the analysis in
   [I-D.lhan-problems-requirements-satellite-net].  From the paper, we
   can easily categorize satellite links as two types, steady and un-
   steady.  For un-steady links, the link status will be flipping every
   couple of minutes.

   Section 5.5 has more details about how to identify different links.

   Some researches have been done to handle such fast changed
   topologies. one method to overcome the difficulties for routing with
   un-steady links is to only use the steady links, and get rid of un-
   steady links unless it is necessary.  For example, for real
   deployment, only links between satellite and ground stations are
   mandatory to use, other un-steady links can be avoided in routing and
   switching algorithms.  [Routing-for-LEO] proposed to calculate the
   shortest path by avoiding un-steady links in polar area and links
   crossing Seam line since satellites will move in the opposite
   direction crossing the Seam line.

   Traditionally, to establish an IP network for satellites, each
   satellite and its interface between satellites and to ground stations
   have to be assigned IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6).  The IP address can
   be either private or public.  IP address itself does not mean
   anything except routing prefix and interface identifier [RFC8200].

   To utilize the satellite relative position for routing, it is desired
   that there is an easy way to identify the relative positions of
   different satellites and identify un-steady links quickly.  The
   traditional IP address cannot provide such functionality unless we
   have the real-time processing for 3D coordinates of satellites to
   figure out the relative positions of each satellite, and some math
   calculation and dynamic database are also needed in routing algorithm

   to check if a link is steady or not.  This will introduce extra data
   exchanged for routing protocols and burden for the computation in
   every satellite.  Considering the ISL link speed (up to 10G for
   2000km) and hardware cost (Radiation-hardened semiconductor
   components are needed) in satellite are more constraint than for
   network device on ground, it is expected to simplify the routing
   algorithm, reduce the requirement of ISL, onboard CPU and memory.

   The document proposes to form a semantic address by satellite orbit
   information, and then embedded it into a proper IP address.  The IP
   address of IGP neighbors can directly tell the relative position of
   different satellites and if links between two satellites are stead or
   not.

   The document does not describe the details how the semantic address
   is used to improve routing and switching or new routing protocols,
   those will be addressed in different documents.

4.  Basics of Satellite Constellation and Satellite Orbit

   This section will introduce some basics for satellite such as orbit
   parameters.

4.1.  Satellite Orbit

   The orbit of a satellite can be either circular or ecliptic, it can
   be described by following Keplerian elements [KeplerianElement]:

   1.  Inclination (i)

   2.  Longitude of the ascending node (Omega)

   3.  Eccentricity (e)

   4.  Semimajor axis (a)

   5.  Argument of periapsis (omega)

   6.  True anomaly (nu)

   The circular orbit is widely used by proposals of satellite
   constellation from different companies and countries.

   For a circular orbit, we will have:

   *  Eccentricity e = 0

   *  Semimajor axis a = Altitude of satellite



Han, et al.             Expires 7 September 2022                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        Satellite Semantic Addressing           March 2022


   *  Argument of periapsis omega = 90 degree

   So, three parameters, Altitude, Inclination and Longitude of the
   ascending node, will be enough to describe the orbit.  The satellite
   will move in a constant speed and True anomaly (nu) can be easily
   calculated after the epoch time is defined.

4.2.  Satellite Constellation Compositions

   One satellite constellation may be composed of many satellites (LEO
   and VLEO), but normally all satellites are grouped in a certain order
   that is never changed during the life of satellite constellation.
   Each satellite constellation's orbits parameters described in
   Section 4.1 must be approved by regulator and cannot be changed
   either.  Follows are characters of one satellite constellation:

   1.  One Satellite Constellation is composed of couple of shell groups
       of satellites.

   2.  Same shell group of satellite will have the same altitude and
       inclination.

   3.  The total N orbit planes in the same shell group of satellites
       will be evenly distributed by the same interval of Longitude of
       the ascending node (Omega).  The interval equals to (360 degree/
       N).  As a result, all orbit planes in the same shell group will
       effectively form a shell to cover earth (there will be a coverage
       hole for the shell if the inclination angle is less than 90
       degree).

   4.  Each orbit plane in the same shell group will have the same
       number of satellites, all satellites in the same orbit plane will
       be evenly distributed angularly in the orbit plane.

   5.  All satellites in the same shell group are moving in the same
       circular direction within the same orbit plane.  As a result, at
       any location on earth, we can see there will have two group of
       satellites moving on the opposite direction.  One group moves
       from south to north, and another group moves from north to south.
       Section 5.5 has more details.

4.3.  Communication between Satellites by ISL

   When ISL is used for the communication between satellites, each
   satellite will have a fixed number of links to connect to its
   neighbor.  Due to the cost of ISL and the constraints of power supply
   on satellite, the number of ISL is normally limited to connect to its
   closest neighbors.  In 3D space, each satellite may have six types of
   adjacent satellites, each type represents one direction.  The number
   of adjacent neighbors in one direction is dependent on the number of
   deployment of ISL device on satellites, for example, the laser
   transmitter and receiver for ISLL.  Figure 1 illustrates satellite S0
   and its adjacent neighbors.

   4.  The left adjacent satellites S5 and S6 that are on the left orbit

   5.  The above adjacent satellites S7 to S9 that are on the above
       orbit plane of S0

   6.  The below adjacent satellite S10 to S12 that are on the below
       orbit of plane S0

   The relative position of adjacent satellites will directly determine
   the quality of ISL and communication.  From the analysis in
   [I-D.lhan-problems-requirements-satellite-net], The speed of
   satellite is only related to the altitude of the satellite (on
   circular orbit), all satellites with a same altitude will move with
   the same speed.  So, in above adjacent satellites, some adjacent
   satellite's relative positions are steady and the ISL can be alive
   without interruption caused by movement.  Some adjacent satellites
   relative positions are changing quickly, the ISL may be down since
   the distance may become out of reach for the laser of ISL, or the
   quick changed positions of two satellite make the tracking of laser
   too hard.  Below are details:

   *  The relative position of satellites in the same orbit plane will
      be the steadiest.

   *  The relative position of satellites in the direct neighbor orbit
      planes in the same shell group and moving in the same direction
      will be steady at equator area, but will be changing when two
      orbits meet on the polar area.  Whether the link status will be
      flipping depends on the tracking technology and the range of laser
      pointing angle of ISL.  See Figure 2.

   *  The relative position of satellites in the neighbor orbit planes
      in the same shell group but moving in the different direction will
      not be steady at all times.  More details are explained in
      Figure 8

   *  The relative position of satellites in the neighbor orbit planes
      in the different shell group will be dependent on the difference
      of altitude and inclination.  This has been analyzed in
      [I-D.lhan-problems-requirements-satellite-net].

       tracking technology supports, the ISL will not be flipping
       after passing polar area; Otherwise, the link will be flipping

5.  Addressing of Satellite

   When ISL is deployed in satellite constellation, all satellites in
   the constellation can form a network like the wired network on
   ground.  Due to the big number of satellites in a constellation, the
   network could be either L2 or L3.  The document proposes to use L3
   network for better scalability.

   When satellites form a L3 network, it is expected that IP address is
   needed for each satellite and its ISLs.

   While the traditional IP address can still be used for satellite
   network, the document proposes an alternative new method for
   satellite's addressing system.  The new addressing system can
   indicate a satellite's orbit info such as shell group index, orbit
   plane index and satellite index.  This will make the adjacent
   satellite identification for link status easier and benefit the
   routing algorithms.

5.1.  Indexes of Satellite

   As described in Section 4.2, one satellite has three important orbit
   related information as described below.

   1.  Index for the shell group of satellites in a satellite
       constellation

   2.  Index for the orbit plane in a shell group of satellites

Internet-Draft        Satellite Semantic Addressing           March 2022


   3.  Index for the satellite in an orbit plane

   It should be noted that for all type of indexes, it is up to the
   owner to assign the index number.  There is no rule for which one
   should be assigned with which number.  The only important rule is
   that all index number should be in sequential to reflect its relative
   order and position with others.  Below is an example of assignment
   rules:

   1.  The 1st satellite launched in an orbit plane can be assigned for
       the 1st satellite index (0), the incremental direction of the
       satellite index in the same orbit plane is the incremental
       direction of "Argument of periapsis (omega)"

   2.  The 1st orbit plane established can be assigned for the 1st orbit
       plane index (0), the incremental direction of the orbit plane
       index is the incremental direction of "Longitude of the ascending
       node (Omega)".

   3.  The shell group of satellites with the lowest altitude can be
       assigned for the 1st shell group index (0), the incremental
       direction of shell group index is the incremental direction of
       altitude.

   Figure 3 and Figure 4 illustrate three types of indexes for
   satellite.

5.2.  The Range of Satellite Indexes

   The ranges of different satellite indexes will determine the range
   the dedicated field for semantic address.  The maximum indexes depend
   on the number of shell group, orbit plane and satellite per orbit
   plane.  The number of orbit plane and satellite per orbit plane have
   relationship with the coverage of a satellite constellation.  There
   are minimum numbers required to cover earth.
   [I-D.lhan-problems-requirements-satellite-net] has given the detailed
   math to estimate the minimal number required to cover the earth.
   There are two key parameters that determine the minimal number of
   satellite required.  One is the elevation angle, another is the
   altitude.  SpaceLink has proposed two elevation angles, 25 and 35
   degrees [SpaceX-Non-GEO].  The lowest LEO altitude can be 160km
   according to [Lowest-LEO-ESA].  The Table 1 and Table 2 illustrate
   the estimation for different altitude (As), the coverage radius (Rc),
   the minimal required number of orbit planes (No) and satellite per
   orbit plane (Ns).  The elevation angle is 25 degree and 35 degrees
   respectively.

         plane (No) and satellite (Ns) per orbit for different LEO/
                     VLEOs, Elevation angle = 35 degree

   The real deployment may be different as above analysis.  Normally,
   more satellites and orbit planes are used to provide better coverage.
   So far, there are only two proposals available, one is StarLink,
   another is from China Constellation.  For proposals of [StarLink],
   there are 7 shell groups, the number of orbit plane and satellites
   per orbit plane in all shell groups are 72 and 58; For proposals of
   [China-constellation], there are 7 shell groups, the number of orbit
   plane and satellites per orbit plane in all shell groups are 60 and
   60;

   It should be noted that some technical parameters, such as the
   inclination and altitude of orbit planes, in above proposals may be
   changed during the long-time deployment period, but the total numbers
   for indexes normally do not change.

   From the above analysis, to be conservative, it is safe to conclude
   that the range of all three satellite indexes are less than 256, or
   8-bit number.

5.3.  Other Info for satellite addressing

   In addition to three satellite indexes described in Section 5.1,
   other information is also important and can also be embedded into
   satellite address:

   1.  The company or country code, or the owner code.  In the future,
       there may have multiple satellite constellations on the sky from
       different organizations, and the inter-constellation
       communication may become as normal that is similar to the network
       on the ground.  This code will be useful to distinguish different
       satellite constellation and make the inter-constellation
       communication possible.  One satellite constellation will have

       one code assigned by international regulator (IANA or ITU).
       Considering the limit of LEO orbits and the cost of satellite
       constellations, the total number of satellite constellation is
       very limited.  So, the size of code is limited.

   2.  The Interface Index.  This index is to identify the ISL or ISLL
       for a satellite.  As described in Section 4.3, the total number
       of ISL is limited.  So, the size of interface index is also
       limited.

5.4.  Encoding of Satellite Semantic Address

   The encoding for satellite semantic address is dependent on what
   routing and switching (L2 or L3 solution) technologies are used for
   satellite networking, and finally dependent on the decision of IETF
   community.

   Follows are some initial proposals:

   1.  When satellite network is using L3 solution, the satellite
       semantic address is encoded as the interface identifier (i.e.,
       the rightmost 64 bits) of the IPv6 address for IPv6.  Figure 5
       shows the format of IPv6 Satellite Address.

   2.  When satellite network is using L2 solution, the satellite
       semantic address can be embedded into the field of "Network
       Interface Controller (NIC) Specific" in MAC address
       [IEEE-MAC-Address].  But due to shorter space for NIC, the "Index
       for the shell group" and "Index for Interface" will only have
       4-bit.  This is illustrated in Figure 6.  This encoded MAC
       address can also be used for L3 solution where the interface MAC
       may be also needed to be configured for each ISL.

   3.  Recently, some works suggested to use Length Variable IP address
       for routing and switching [Length-Variable-IP] or use flexible IP
       address [I-D.jia-flex-ip-address-structure] or shorter IP address
       [I-D.li-native-short-addresses] to solve some specific problems
       that regular IPv6 is not very suitable.  Satellite network also
       belongs to such specific network.  Due to the resource and cost
       constraints and requirement for radiation hardened electronic
       components, the ISL speed, on-board processor and memory are
       limited in performance, power consumption and capacity compared
       with network devices on ground.  So, using IPv6 directly in
       satellite network is not an optimal solution because IPv6 header
       size is too long for such small network.  From above analysis,
       32-bit to 64-bit length of IP address is enough for satellite
       networking.  Using 128-bit IPv6 will consume more resource
       especially the ISL bandwidth, processing power and memory, etc.

       If shorter than 128-bit IP address is accepted as IETF work, the
       satellite semantic address can be categorized as a similar use
       case.  Figure 7 illustrates a 32-bit Semantic Satellite Address
       format.  The final coding for the shorter IP address can be
       decided by the community.  How to use the 32-bit Semantic
       Satellite address can be addressed later on in different
       document.

   and un-steady links is as simple as below:

   Assuming:

   1.  The total number of satellites per orbit plane is M

   2.  The total number of orbit planes per shell group is N.

   3.  Two satellites have:

       *  Satellite Indexes as: Sat1_Index, Sat2_Index

       *  Orbit plane Indexes as: Orbit1_Index, Orbit2_Index

       *  Shell group Indexes as: Shell1_Index, Shell2_Index

   Steady links:

   1.  The links between adjacent satellites on the same orbit plane,
       or, the satellite indexes satisfy:

       *  Sat2_Index = Sat1_Index + 1, when Sat1_Index < M-1; Sat2_Index
          = 0, when Sat1_Index = M-1; and

       *  Orbit1_Index = Orbit2_Index, Shell1_Index = Shell2_Index.

   2.  The links between satellites on adjacent orbit planes on the same
       altitude.  and two satellites are moving to the same direction,
       or, the satellite indexes satisfy:

       *  Orbit2_Index = Orbit1_Index + 1, when Orbit1_Index < N-1;
          Orbit2_Index = 0, when Orbit1_Index = N-1; and

       *  Shell1_Index = Shell2_Index.

       *  Sat1_Index and Sat2_Index may be equal or have difference,
          depend on how the link is established.

   Un-Steady links:

   1.  The links between satellite and ground stations.

   2.  The links between satellites on adjacent orbit planes on the same
       altitude.  Two satellites are moving to the different direction.
       Or, the satellite indexes do not satisfy conditions described in
       above #2 for Steady links.

   3.  The links between satellites on adjacent orbit planes on
       different altitude.  Or, the satellite indexes satisfy:

       *  Shell1_Index != Shell2_Index.

   Figure 8 illustrates the links for adjacent orbit planes (#2 for
   Steady Link and Un-steady Link above).  From the figure, it can be
   noticed that some links may have shorter distance than steady link,
   but they are unsteady.  For example, the links between S1 and S4; S4
   and S2; S2 and S5, etc.

       * The total number of orbit planes are N
       * The number (i-1, i, i+1,...) represents the Orbit index
       * The bottom numbers (i-1, i, i+1) are for orbit planes on
         which satellites (S1, S2, S3) are moving from bottom to up.
       * The top numbers (i+N/2, i+1+N/2, i+2+N/2) are for orbit
         planes on which satellites (S4, S5, S6) are moving from up
         to bottom.
       * Dot lines are the steady links
