                      draft-xue-dhc-dynamic-gre-02

Abstract

   Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is regarded as a popular
   encapsulation tunnel technology because of simpleness and easy
   implementation.  When a node tries to encapsulate the user traffic in
   a GRE tunnel, it needs to first obtain the IP address of the
   destination node which need to decapsulate the GRE packets.  In
   practice, the GRE tunnel destination IP address may be manually
   configured.  This configuration introduces efficiency issues for
   operators, especially, in the scenarios where there are a large
   number entities need to deploy GRE tunnels.  This work proposes an
   approach to configure the GRE information dynamiclly.

1.  Introduction

   Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) [RFC1701][RFC2784] is widely
   deployed in the operators' networks.  When a node tries to
   encapuslate the user traffic in a GRE tunnel, it needs to first
   obtain the IP address of the destination node which can decapsulate
   the GRE packets.

   In practice, the decapsulation node IP address of GRE may be manually
   configured.  This configuration introduces efficiency issues for
   operators, espeically, in the scenarios where there are large amount
   of GRE tunnels needed.  This work describes a case about large amount
   of GRE tunnels deployment required and proposes a solution which
   extends Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) so as to enable to
   configure the GRE destination node IP address dynamically.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminologies are used in this document.

   Access Controller (AC)

   The network entity that provides Wireless Termination Point (WTP)
   access to the network infrastructure in the data plane, control
   plane, management plane, or a combination therein.

   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)

   The CPE equipment is the box that a provider may distribute to the
   customers, which could be Home Gateway (HG), Cable Modem (CM), etc.
   When CPE is using DHCP to obtain network address, CPE is acting as
   "DHCP Client"

   Network Facing Equipment (NPE)

   The NPE is the device to be deployed with the signalling and control
   functions.  It is kind of Service Gateway.

   User Equipment (UE)

   The UE is the a device of the customers, which could be PC or Mobile
   Phone.

   User Facing Equipment (UPE)

   The UPE is the device to make forwarding decisions at the ingress of
   the provider network, which could be Cable Modem Termination Systems
   (CMTS).  UPE is the "DHCP Server" or "DHCP relay agent" in DHCP
   framework.

   Wireless Termination Point (WTP)

   The physical or logical network entity that contains an RF antenna
   and wireless physical layer (PHY) to transmit and receive station
   traffic for wireless access networks.

3.  Use Case

   Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) has emerged as an important access
   technology for service operators.  Some operators deploy a large
   number of WTPs in the specific environments with the dense crowd.  In
   this scenario, WTPs are preferred to be managed and controlled in a
   centralized location by AC.  The traffic of WTPs are generally
   handled on the access router of the network, which is a different

   node from AC.  This architecture can avoid the overload for traffic
   management on the AC.  This motivates the need for the WTP to support
   some tunnel encapsulation technologies to the Access Router.  GRE is
   one of the preferred tunnel solution, because of simple and easy
   deployment reasons.

   Currently, several tunnel mechanisms have been standardized, for
   example Layer Two Tunneling Protocol version 3 (L2TPv3) [RFC3931].
   L2TPv3 supports IP/UDP encapsulation and fulfills the tunnel
   requirements.  However, as a multi-layers encapsulation protocol,
   L2TPv3 has to carry multiple protocol headers per data packet.  It is
   complicated and costly, mostly used for Virtual Private Network
   (VPN).  Most CPE devices are too simple to be a L2TPv3 initiator.

   An illustration of WLAN network is shown in figure 1.  When WTP tries
   to encapsulate the user traffic in a GRE tunnel, it needs to first
   obtain the Access Router (AR) IP address.  In practice, this IP
   address is usually deployed on WTP manually, which introduces
   efficiency issues for operators.  Especially, a large number of WTPs
   are deployed with the dense crowd.

4.  Dynamic GRE Tunnel

   This work proposes an automatic solution which extends Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP) so as to configure the GRE destination
   IP address.  Due to successful IP address configuration, GRE tunnel
   can be setup dynamically.

   Figure 2 illustrates the procedure for dynamic GRE tunnel in WLAN
   network.  The WTP, AR in the picture are respectively the CPE and
   NPE.

   At Preliminary Phase, the CPE as one endpoint of GRE tunnel, may get
   information of NPE by the DHCP approach.  CPE sends the DHCP request
   to initiate a IPv4 address request.  When a DHCP server replies the
   CPE request message, the NPE information can be carried in a DHCP
   reply message via DHCP options.  Thus CPE configures the NPE address
   y.y.y.y and tunnel parameter of GRE tunnel, such as GRE key etc if
   they are carried in the DHCP message.  For load sharing or single-
   point failure recovery purposes, a DHCP reply message may carry
   information of more than one NPEs.

   Consequently, NPE can discover CPE via the received GRE encapsulated
   packet from CPE.  Then the GRE tunnel information, such as IP address
   of CPE as source address is checked and restored as destination of
   GRE tunnel on NPE side.  Generally, CPE can encapsulate UE's first
   packet with GRE, no matter data packet or control packet.  For
   example, during a User Equipment (UE) subscriber attached initiates
   the DHCP procedure for an inner address, CPE should encapsulated this
   DHCP message via GRE.

   When NPE receives the packet with GRE encapsulation, it should look
   up the outer source IP of the packet in its tunnel client list.  If
   it is a new client, the NPE adds source IP into the tunnel client
   list, decapsulates GRE header and deals with the packet encapsulated
   by GRE.

   There could be a keepalive mechanism for GRE tunnel between CPE and
   NPE.  If there is neither keepalive packet nor data packet when the
   deployed timer expires, the NPE will tear down the tunnel and
   releases resource

5.  DHCP Option Definition

   As introduced above, The DHCPv4 GRE Discovery (GD) Option is defined,
   when CPE wants to obtain an NPE address in IPv4 network.  This Option
   is carried in DHCPv4.

   The DHCPv4 GD Option is structured as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3

                         DHCPv4 GRE Key Suboption

   Based on requirement defined in [RFC2784] [RFC2890], GRE Key
   Suboption is used in this document to configure the complementary
   tunnel information.  GRE Key is generated from [RFC2890].  If the
   client receives the GRE Key suboption, the key MUST be inserted into
   the GRE encapsulation header.  It is used for identifying extra
   context information about the received payload.  The payload packets
   without the correspondent GRE Key or with an unmatched GRE Key will
   be silently dropped.

   Len (1 octet): The total octets of the suboption value field.

   Suboption Value : GRE Key according definition in [RFC2890].

   The DHCPv6 GRE Discovery (GD) Option is mainly used when CPE wants to
   obtain an NPE address in IPv6 network.  This option is carried in
   DHCPv6.  According to [I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines]The DHCPv6 GD
   Option is structured as follows.
