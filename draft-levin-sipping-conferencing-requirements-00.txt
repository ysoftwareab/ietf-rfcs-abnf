Abstract 
    
   At present, SIP signaling sessions under a conferencing application 
   must rely on out-of-band signaling for participant information and 
   conference manipulation. This document suggests an integrated 
   approach that defines a Hierarchal Application Signaling Model and 
   allows SIP to support both basic and complex applications based on 
   more basic applications. As example conferencing applications, a 
   general "SIP Star Conferencing Application" and a more specialized 
   "SIP Star Real Time Multimedia Conferencing Application" are defined 
   within this Hierarchical Application Signaling Model. This document 
   identifies requirements for SIP entities that participate or host 
   these applications. 
   A future document will suggest the mapping of the requirements to 
   corresponding protocols and their primitives.

           Conferencing Requirements for SIP Based Applications 
                                      
    
1. Introduction 
    
Scope 
   This document defines a Hierarchal Application Signaling Model 
   allowing for building integrated applications based on more basic 
   applications. Terminology is also defined in order to describe this 
   model and related application requirements. 
    
   When coordination of multiple applications is necessary, a Meta 
   Application is needed. This document addresses the notion of 
   building a Meta Application and specific applications using SIP. 
   Nevertheless, the Application Signaling Hierarchal Model doesn't 
   preclude from using applications based on other protocols. 
    
   Specifically, this document defines a general-purpose "SIP Star 
   Conferencing Application" and a more specific "SIP Star Real Time 
   Multimedia Conferencing Application" as the applications fitting the 
   defined model. This document identifies requirements for SIP 
   entities in order to participate and optionally host these 
   applications in a standard interoperable manner. 
    
   A future document will provide both the mapping from the 
   requirements to existing protocols' primitives (whenever possible) 
   and suggest directions for required extensions (whenever the desired 
   functionality doesn't exist). Together, both documents would provide 
   a guide for building interoperable SIP Star Real Time Multimedia 
   Conferencing Applications.

3. Hierarchal Application Signaling Model 
    
Model 
   This document defines a Hierarchal Application Signaling Model, 
   which has a Meta Application at its root. The Meta Application is a 
   template for building any complex free-style applications that make 
   use of more basic, usually standard, applications. The Application 
   model doesn't preclude the use of non-SIP applications.  
    
   A Meta Application maintains a Meta Database containing information 
   about associated applications and their respective participants. 
   Participant's Meta information might include, among others, various 
   URI schemes including SIP URL. 
    
   Each application may contain zero or more Data Planes. Data Plane is 
   an application "product" that spans across the network. For example, 
   the RTP [15] streams, established by a conferencing (signaling) 
   application, define its media Data Plane.  Usually, a Data Plane is 
   produced upon a request from an application that is higher in the 
   signaling hierarchy. The Data Plane is created and controlled by the 
   application it belongs to. 
    
   Each application may contain Sub-applications. Sub-application is a 
   signaling application that is lower to the application in the 
   signaling hierarchy. Sub-application is used by the (higher) 
   application for control of its (that of the higher application) 
   internal Data Base and Data Planes. This model allows for component-
   based approach, i.e. this allows for implementing of relevant 
   components only, adding more advanced components (such as floor 
   control) at later stage, and replacing existing components. 
    
Examples 
    
   Examples below illustrate the defined Hierarchal Application 
   Signaling Model. The signaling hierarchy and its (sub-) applications 
   are shown by "\" and "---". The Data Planes and the Databases 
   together with their relations to the applications are shown by 
   "====" and "\\".

   -------  -------  =====   
    
   This example makes use of a Meta Application with two specific 
   multiparty applications sharing a common group of participants. One 
   application is a centralized SIP voice conference and the other one 
   is a full mesh instant messaging application using some proprietary 
   protocol. The two applications are being established and terminated, 
   with the help of the Meta Application, independently from each 
   other. The Meta Application may add and delete participants of 
   either application in an abstract way. 
    
   A Chair Control Application is responsible for arbitration of a 
   Conference Chair role. In this example, only the Conference Chair is 
   responsible for adding and deleting conferencing participants "to" 
   and "from" both of the conferences. In this case, the single Chair 
   Control Application is a Sub-application of the Meta application. 
    
   If a Floor Control, managing groups of media streams or other shared 
   resources within a conference, is required [15], such Floor Control 
   Application would be a Sub-application of the SIP voice conference 
   and as such would be able to reference conferencing internal shared 
   resources. 
    
   Note that in this application hierarchy, the Voice Conferencing 
   Application SHOULD have means to convey the identity of the 
   Conference Chair from the Meta Application to the Conferencing Floor 
   Control Application. 
    
 Example 2: Sub-applications within a SIP Application 
    
   In this example, the Meta Application consists of two specific 
   multiparty applications sharing a common group of participants. One 
   application is a centralized SIP voice and video conferencing and 
   the other is a White Board T.120 based application. T.120 protocol 
   [2] defines a Star topology and conferencing primitives of its own. 
   In this case two possibilities exist.

           Conferencing Requirements for SIP Based Applications 
                                      
    
     ===========     ------------- 
 
   In the first case, the Meta Application enables the SIP Conferencing 
   and the White Board applications to be established independently 
   from each other. Therefore, both applications are Sub-applications 
   of the Meta Application. They may have same or different 
   participants. The Meta Application can directly access each of the 
   applications, but needs to be able to reach the participants of 
   either application by separate means. 
    
    
                           Meta Application 
                     ---------------------------- 
                       /                     \       
                      /                       \ 
          SIP Voice and Video Conference       \ 
          ------------------------------        \ 
            //            \            \\        \     
           //              \            \\        \     
     Media Plane     Media Control    White Board T.120-based 
     ===========     -------------    ======================= 
                                      ----------------------- 
 
   In the second case, the SIP Conferencing Application is established 
   first. Then, upon the Meta Application request, the T.120 [2] 
   addresses and parameters are signaled to SIP Conferencing 
   participants by the SDP means [12] within the SIP sessions of the 
   SIP conferencing application. In this case, the White Board 
   Application is one of the Data Planes of the SIP conferencing 
   application. White Board participants are a subset of the SIP 
   conference participants. The Meta Application was able to reach the 
   participants by SIP means, and still can access the White Board 
   Application directly. As such, the White Board Application is a Sub-
   application of the Meta Application. 
    
 Example 3: Remote Device Control Application 
    
   An example of remote device control is Far End Camera Control. This 
   is an important feature in video conferencing. This feature enables 
   the remote user to control the remote camera (Zoom and Pan). The 
   feature is used, for example, in medical application when the remote 
   viewer can control the view without having to interrupt the people 
   doing the operation. The requirement is to enable interoperability 
   of the feature between end user videoconferencing equipment from 
   different vendors. Far End Camera Control is a private case of a 
   general Remote Device Control. 
    
   This kind of applications requires an ability to address the innate 
   SIP/SDP objects (such as media streams). That is in order to 
   associate a specific remote device (such as a camera) with specific 
   media streams.

           Conferencing Requirements for SIP Based Applications 
                                      
    
    
   We believe that the defined Hierarchal Application Signaling Model 
   would help to define Remote Device Control applications in 
   consistent manner. 
 
4. SIP Star Conferencing Application 
    
   SIP Star Conferencing Applications fit the Hierarchal Application 
   Signaling Model defined above. 
    
   SIP Star Conferencing Application is an association of SIP User 
   Agents for providing a shared application in a star topology. Each 
   User Agent in a Star Conference has a Conference Role: a Center 
   Participant or an Edge Participant. At a certain point of time, SIP 
   Star Conference has a single Center Participant and zero or more 
   Edge Participants. Effectively, at a certain point of time, the 
   Center Participant hosts the Star Conference. The Center Participant 
   can be either an end user or an application server. The model 
   doesn't preclude from any participant (including an Edge 
   Participant) to have a role of Conference Chair. 
   Editor's Note: Add definitions for Conference Chair (Moderator). 
    
Model 
   A Center Participant has direct peer-wise relationships with each of 
   the Edge Participants by means of a SIP dialog. Dialogs may belong 
   to different or same SIP sessions. The Center Participant is a SIP 
   User Agent that maintains correlation among conference's dialogs 
   internally. From SIP Conference perspective, the Center Participant 
   is a conference participant by itself. 
    
   The SIP Star Conferencing Application MAY have zero or more Data 
   Planes and Sub-applications in order to control or manage them.  
    
Requirements 
    
 General Design Guidelines 
  
   The goal is to define a tight conference control (in contrast to 
   loose conference control). 
    
   The goal is to define a framework for both pre-arranged (i.e. 
   scheduled) and spontaneous conferencing modes. 
    
   Simplicity is an important guideline. Conferencing framework SHOULD 
   balance being powerful enough for most practical scenarios, yet avoid 
   being too complex to be widely accepted and implemented on devices 
   with limited computational resources and user interfaces. 
    
   Solution SHOULD be mobile-friendly, since mobile low-bandwidth 
   devices represent large portion of user base. Bandwidth consumption 
   on the access link is the most important mobile requirement. It means

           Conferencing Requirements for SIP Based Applications 
                                      
    
   that unnecessary (frequent) communication MUST be minimized. 
   Notification frequency SHOULD be configurable by the user. Similarly, 
   incremental modifications MUST be supported. The solution MUST NOT 
   assume IP multicast since it is not widely available in mobile 
   networks or in residential environments (such as PPPoE). 
 
   Two kinds of operations SHOULD be defined for conference control: 
   commands and informative notifications. 
    
   Asynchronous commands mode SHOULD be defined. Commands execution may 
   take a long time, especially if human intervention is required. 
     
   Asynchronous Notifications (i.e. push mode) MUST be defined. 
 
 Mandatory (Minimal) Participation Requirements for SIP Baseline 
 Participants 
  
   Each conference participant MUST support SIP baseline specifications 
   [11]. SIP User Agents, that don't support Star Conferencing 
   extensions, SHALL be able to participate in a SIP Star Conference as 
   Edge Participants, although without benefiting from information and 
   functionality that these extensions provide. 
   Specifically, Center Participant SHALL be able to invite and
   disconnect SIP baseline Edge Participant to and from a SIP Star 
   Conference. 
    
 Mandatory (Minimal) Participant Requirements 
  
   Center Participant MUST support SIP conference identification 
   extensions and conventions. 
    
 SIP Star Conferencing Requirements 
  
   Conference identification SHALL be standardized. Global Conference 
   Identifier allows for matching existing (active or reserved) 
   conferences. One of the examples for using the Conference Identifier 
   is upon joining a specific conference. The Conference Identifier 
   SHALL be included in each conference-related primitive (such as 
   commands and indications). 
   Editor's Note: Open Issue - Shall the Conference Identifier be 
   routable? 
    
   Conference description SHOULD be standardized. Conference 
   Description is a way of specifying a desired (but unknown) 
   conference in terms of its capabilities, modes, location, etc. One 
   of the examples for using a Conference Description is upon creating 
   a new conference. 
    
   Conference Participant SHOULD have means to express the level and 
   the granularity of its support for SIP Star Conferencing extensions.

           Conferencing Requirements for SIP Based Applications 
                                      
    
   Center Participant SHALL be able to convey a current Conference Role 
   of each of the participants (i.e. Center Participant vs. Edge 
   Participant) to other participants in the Conference. 
    
   A procedure for moving a Center Participant role from a current 
   Center to another Participant SHALL be defined. 
    
   Standard way of implementing following procedures by both Center and 
   Edge participants SHALL be defined: 
   Create/Terminate Conference 
   Invite/Disconnect Edge Participant 
   Invite/Disconnect a list of Edge Participants (Mass-invitation) 
    
   Each one of the conference participants (i.e. not the Center 
   Participant only) MUST have an ability to be a Conference Chair. 
    
   Standard means SHALL be defined in order to create a Data Plane of an 
   application (including others then SIP-based) using SIP signaling. 
   One of the examples of such application is the Data Conferencing 
   protocol T.120 [2]. Please, refer to Example 2 of "Hierarchal 
   Application Signaling Model" above. 
   Editor's note: We don't believe that it is enough to have the 
   association with T.120 by means of a Meta Application only.  
 
   A means SHOULD be defined in order to convey the information listed 
   below to any SIP entity that supports Conferencing extensions and 
   complies with security policies: 
   Conference's Details 
   Participants' Details (Must not assume RTCP.) 
    
   A Conference Participant SHOULD be able to define the level of the 
   details it wants to receive as conference notifications or 
   announcements (e.g. user may not want to receive informational 
   notifications at all). 
    
   It MUST be possible to participate anonymously in a conference. It 
   MUST be possible to hide conferencing participants. 
    
   We envision that additional requirements (such as floor control, 
   conferencing management, etc.) will be grouped according to their 
   subjects and defined as Sub-applications of the SIP Star Conferencing 
   Application. 
 
5. SIP Star Real Time Multimedia Conferencing Application 
    
   SIP Star Real Time Multimedia Conferencing Application is a private 
   case of the SIP Star Conferencing Application model as defined 
   above. 
    
Model

           Conferencing Requirements for SIP Based Applications 
                                      
    
   SIP Star Real Time Multimedia Conference is SIP Star Conferencing 
   Application with one or more Media Planes. 
    
   Media Plane is a private case of Data Plane. 
    
   Media Plane is a subset of media streams established using SDP [12] 
   (and its extensions) between a Center Participant and Edge 
   Participants in a conference. These media streams flow between a 
   Conference Center and an Edge Participant only. These streams may be 
   unicast or multicast, depending on the SDP information, exchanged 
   within SIP conferencing dialogs. 
    
   SIP Star Real Time Multimedia Conference MAY have Data Planes that 
   are not Media Planes.  
    
   SIP Star Real Time Multimedia Conferencing application SHOULD 
   contain Media Control Sub-application(s). 
    
Media Plane 
    
   A Media Plane groups streams belonging to different SIP dialogs for 
   various application reasons. The Media Plane content is an 
   application matter. A certain stream MAY belong to more then a 
   single Media Plane. Examples of Media Planes are a specific Audio 
   Plane and a specific Video Plane. 
    
   Within an SDP session, SDP extension [13] provides optional means 
   for association among streams (i.e. m-lines) for various application 
   reasons. Consequently, this mechanism MAY provide means for 
   association among Media Planes. 
    
 Model 
    
   Media Plane consists of zero or more Media Processors. 
   Media Processor consists of zero or more Presentation Spaces. 
    
   Both, Presentation Spaces and Media Processors, SHALL be referable 
   to Sub-conferencing applications (such as Media Control and Floor 
   Control). 
    
   Internal (local) communications between a SIP Star Call/Conferencing 
   Application and its Media Plane are out of scope of this framework. 
   Standard protocols (such as MEGACO [14] and MGCP [17]) and 
   proprietary protocols MAY be used for this purpose. 
    
   The Media Plane optional components are described below. 
    
 Presentation Space

           Conferencing Requirements for SIP Based Applications 
                                      
    
   Presentation Space is a data model comprised of a set of input (i.e. 
   source) streams, a set of output streams, and processing logic (such 
   as mixing or switching) performed inside the Presentation Space box. 
    
   This model allows for both pre-defined (well-known) and customized 
   Presentation Spaces. The well-known Presentation Spaces could be 
   defined as follows: 
    
   Audio Presentation Space 
   An Audio Presentation Space is capable of mixing the incoming audio 
   streams. An Audio Presentation Space is defined by the audio CODECs 
   it supports and the number of sources it can mix in a single stream.  
    
   Video Presentation Space  
   A Video Presentation Space is capable of mixing one or more video 
   streams. A mix of a single stream is also known as a video switch. A 
   Video Presentation Space is defined by the CODECs it supports, the 
   number of sources it can present in a single picture together with 
   its layout. 
 
   Customized Presentation Spaces may be pre-defined by an application 
   or being defined by participants with right privileges. 
    
 Media Processor 
    
   Media Processor is a logical entity contained within a Media Plane 
   and is responsible for manipulation of the media streams (such as 
   mixing and switching). 
    
   Media Processor behavior is defined by Presentation Spaces, it 
   contains. A Media Processor may have zero or more Presentation 
   Spaces. 
 
   In a Star Conference, a Center Participant maintains (zero or more) 
   Media Processors. Usually, streams flowing from Edge Participants 
   are used as inputs to the Media Processor. The outputs of the Media 
   Processor are sent back towards the Edge Participants. 
    
   This model allows for both pre-defined (well-known) and customized 
   Media Processors. 
    
   The well-known Media Processors could be defined as follows: 
    
   Default Audio Media Processor mixes a predefined number (n) of 
   loudest speaking sources (usually n=3) and sends the resulting 
   stream to the rest of the participants. Speakers do not hear 
   themselves. This Media Processor has either n Presentation Spaces or 
   (n+1) Presentation Spaces (if the number of participants is bigger 
   then n).

           Conferencing Requirements for SIP Based Applications 
                                      
    
   Default videoconferencing application has the audio of the default 
   audio conferencing application.  
    
   Default Video Media Processor sends the video of the loudest speaker 
   (also known as an active speaker) is sent to all the participants. 
   The active speaker sees the previous speaker. This Media Processor 
   has two Video Presentation Spaces, each one performing a switching 
   of a single video stream. 
    
Media Control Sub-application 
    
   In a star topology, many of the Media Control requirements are 
   achieved by exchanging of messages on point-to-point basis between a 
   Center Participant and Edge Participants. 
    
   Conferencing requirements, presented below in this section, refer to 
   the multi-participant nature of the conferencing application. 
    
   Point-to-point requirements, presented below in this section, are 
   not unique for a conferencing application. Nevertheless, because the 
   conferencing application is complex and involves User Agents with 
   potentially different characteristics, their fulfillment is REQUIRED 
   for enabling the multimedia conferencing application.  
    
   The point-to-point requirements are equally applicable to all 
   conference participants, including Edge Participants, and they are 
   included here for completeness of the model. 
    
 General Design Guidelines 
 
   The defined model SHALL enable same architecture and same user 
   experience for both audio only and multimedia conferencing. 
    
   The defined model SHALL enable adding and removing Media Planes 
   during a conference. 
    
   Application driven requirements SHALL use reliable transport 
   mechanism.  
    
 Conferencing Application Requirements 
   Standard way of conveying the following indications SHOULD be 
   defined: 
    
   Participant is presented to at least one other participant 
   Participant is presented to all other participants 
   Identification of a participant that is presented to you now 
    
   Standard way of issuing the following presentation requests towards 
   a Center Participant SHOULD be defined: 
 
   Broadcast specific session (my or somebody's else)

           Conferencing Requirements for SIP Based Applications 
                                      
    
   I am interested in a group of selected media streams only 
    
 Point-to-Point Capabilities Related Requirements 
 
   Default Capabilities' Profiles 
  
   We expect that SIP Conferencing will be deployed in a broad variety 
   of networks (with different characteristics and requirements). 
   Therefore, in order to achieve basic CODEC interoperability, instead 
   of defining the lowest common denominator for all networks, the 
   framework SHOULD define a number of profiles. 
   For example, a Basic LAN Profile could define G.711 for audio and 
   H.261 [4] QCIF for video.   
    
   Capabilities' Exchange 
    
   A User Agent (such as a terminal, a gateway, or an MCU) can support 
   one or more media streams and therefore MUST have means to specify 
   alternate and simultaneous capabilities. 
    
   A User Agent SHOULD have means to explicitly request symmetric 
   CODECs in the send and receive path. This is important for gateways 
   and MCUs that may need to work symmetrically on the legs (i.e. 
   dialogs) of a session or a conference. An example is a gateway from 
   SIP to H.320 [3]. These calls need symmetric CODECs on the switched 
   network side. 
    
   Video capabilities MUST include the following parameters: 
     
   Algorithm (such as H.261, H.263, and MPEG)  
   Maximum Bandwidth Supported  
   Maximum Resolution Supported (QCIF, CIF, 4CIF, and custom formats)  
   Maximum Video Frame Rate 
    
 Point-to-Point "Autonomous" Media Control  
    
   This includes indications exchanged between CODECs as a result of 
   CODEC algorithms. In most cases it is performed independently from 
   the call and conferencing applications. 
 
   Applications involving video are particularly prone to frequent 
   network changes causing packets lost, error conditions, etc. The 
   video information includes full picture frames and frames that 
   reflect changes from previous frames. Losing IP packets causes 
   synchronization problem for the decoder. Various video specific 
   techniques have been used in today's networks in order to cope with 
   fluctuating conditions with minimum service degradation. 
 
   The following indications SHOULD be supported: 
    
   Video MB Not Decoded Indication 
     
   O. Levin et al.         Expires: October 2002              Page 13 
 

           Conferencing Requirements for SIP Based Applications 
                                      
    
    
   This indication is used to inform the encoder not to use specific 
   macro blocks for prediction. 
    
   Lost Picture and Lost Partial Picture Indication 
    
   These indications are used to inform the encoder that it should use 
   an error resilience technique to solve the problem. 
        
 Point-to-Point Application Driven Media Control 
    
   Requesting a change of media stream and/or bandwidth during the 
   session is typical for multiparty conferencing and gateway 
   applications when there is a need to change CODECs and/or their 
   parameters during the session. Additionally, changing of video 
   stream bandwidth is used in order to adapt to a congestion situation 
   by reducing the video rate. 
    
   At the start of the session, it is REQUIRED to have an ability to 
   specify the maximum (i.e. reserved) and the exact bandwidth to be 
   used by the session. It is REQUIRED to have an ability to change the 
   used bandwidth during the session. 
    
   A Request mechanism is REQUIRED to ask a sender to send a stream 
   with specified parameters. The parameters include algorithm, 
   resolution, frame rate and specific CODEC algorithm parameters such 
   as interlace picture for H.263 [5]. 
    
   Video applications MUST have a clean deterministic method to switch 
   between video sources. This requirement is crucial for any basic 
   videoconferencing in order to achieve good user experience.  
   Otherwise, when a decoder suddenly loses synchronization with the 
   old video stream, a bad picture is presented to the user till 
   complete synchronization with the new stream is achieved. In order 
   to achieve this, the REQUIRED primitives are presented below: 
    
   Video Full Picture Fast Update Request 
   Video Update Slice Request 
    
   These commands are to be sent from a decoder to an encoder. 
   Video CODECs (such as H.261 [4] and H.263 [5]) have a notion of 
   picture's building blocks:  "full picture", and "slice".  The 
   decoder has an ability to recognize synchronization problem and MUST 
   have an ability to explicitly request from an encoder for a "full 
   picture", or a specific "slice" of the picture. In addition, when 
   the application needs to start presenting a new video source, it 
   MUST have ability to explicitly request from an encoder for a "full 
   picture". 
    
   Video Freeze Picture Request 
    

     
   O. Levin et al.         Expires: October 2002              Page 14 
 

           Conferencing Requirements for SIP Based Applications 
                                      
    
   This command is to be sent from an encoder to a decoder. In case the 
   encoder is aware of a change in the transmitted picture that would 
   cause lost of synchronization, it MUST be able to request the 
   decoding side to freeze the picture, i.e. to stop presenting the 
   changes, until a new stable image is encoded and transmitted. 
    
 Roadmap 
    
   The requirements, presented above, may be partly achieved today by 
   SDP [12] and [22] together with its extensions, and RTCP [15] 
   together with its extensions. 
    
   We envision that the Capabilities Related Requirements MAY be 
   achieved using SDP with the help of [18] and [20]. 
    
   We envision that the Point-to-Point "Autonomous" Media Control 
   Requirements MAY be achieved using RTCP with the help of its 
   extensions such as [19]. 
    
   In order to achieve interoperable SIP implementations, each of the 
   requirements MUST be mapped into a protocol primitive and a 
   corresponding standard procedure. 
    
   A future document will provide both the mapping from the 
   requirements to existing protocols' primitives (whenever possible) 
   and suggest directions for required extensions (whenever the desired 
   functionality doesn't exist). Together, both documents would provide 
   a guide for building interoperable SIP Star Real Time Multimedia 
   Conferencing Applications. 
    
   At this point of time, it is an Open Issue how the Conferencing 
   Application Requirements are to be implemented by SIP multimedia 
   applications. 
    
   At this point of time, it is an Open Issue how the Application 
   Driven Media Control Requirements are to be implemented by SIP 
   multimedia applications. These requirements are a showstopper for 
   implementation of video conferencing applications using SIP.
