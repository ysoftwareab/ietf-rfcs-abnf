                         JMAP for Sieve Scripts
                        draft-ietf-jmap-sieve-02

Abstract

   This document specifies a data model for managing Sieve scripts on a
   server using JMAP.

Open Issues

   o  Should we introduce an "isIncluded" or "isInUse" filter/sort
      condition for the /query method to locate scripts which are
      included by others?

   o  Do we need any (rate) limits for /test?

   o  Should ":fcc" and associated arguments (e.g., ":flags",
      ":create":, etc) reported in the /test response be in their own
      "fcc" sub-object rather than listed inline with the rest of the
      arguments for the action?

1.  Introduction

   JMAP [RFC8620] (JSON Meta Application Protocol) is a generic protocol
   for synchronizing data, such as mail, calendars or contacts, between
   a client and a server.  It is optimized for mobile and web
   environments, and aims to provide a consistent interface to different
   data types.

   This specification defines a data model for managing Sieve [RFC5228]
   scripts on a server using JMAP.  The data model is designed to allow
   a server to provide consistent access to the same scripts via
   ManageSieve [RFC5804] as well as JMAP, however the functionality
   offered over the two protocols may differ.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Type signatures, examples, and property descriptions in this document
   follow the conventions established in Section 1.1 of [RFC8620].  Data
   types defined in the core specification are also used in this
   document.

   Servers MUST support all properties specified for the new data type
   defined in this document.

   For compatibility with publishing requirements, line breaks have been
   inserted inside long JSON strings, with the following continuation
   lines indented.  To form the valid JSON example, any line breaks
   inside a string must be replaced with a space and any other white
   space after the line break removed.

1.2.  Terminology

   The same terminology is used in this document as in the core JMAP
   specification, see [RFC8620], Section 1.6.

   The term SieveScript (with this specific capitalization) is used to
   refer to the data type defined in this document and instances of
   those data types.

1.3.  Addition to the Capabilities Object

   The capabilities object is returned as part of the JMAP Session
   object; see [RFC8620], Section 2.  This document defines one
   additional capability URI.

1.3.1.  urn:ietf:params:jmap:sieve

   This represents support for the SieveScript data type and associated
   API methods.  The value of this property in the JMAP Session
   capabilities property is an empty object.

   The value of this property in an account's accountCapabilities
   property is an object that MUST contain the following information on
   server capabilities:

   o  *supportsTest*: "Boolean"

      If true, the server supports the SieveScript/test (Section 2.5)
      method.



   o  *maxSizeScriptName*: "UnsignedInt"

      The maximum length, in (UTF-8) octets, allowed for the name of a
      SieveScript.  For compatibility with ManageSieve, this MUST be at
      least 512 (up to 128 Unicode characters).



   o  *maxSizeScript*: "UnsignedInt|null"

      The maximum size (in octets) of a Sieve script the server is
      willing to store for the user, or "null" for no limit.



   o  *maxNumberScripts*: "UnsignedInt|null"

      The maximum number of Sieve scripts the server is willing to store
      for the user, or "null" for no limit.



   o  *maxNumberRedirects*: "UnsignedInt|null"

Internet-Draft                 JMAP Sieve                  November 2020


      The maximum number of Sieve "redirect" actions a script can
      perform during a single evaluation or "null" for no limit.  Note
      that this is different from the total number of "redirect" actions
      a script can contain.



   o  *sieveExtensions*: "String[]"

      A list of case-sensitive Sieve capability strings (as listed in
      Sieve "require" action; see [RFC5228], Section 3.2) indicating the
      extensions supported by the Sieve engine.



   o  *notificationMethods*: "String[]|null"

      A list of URI schema parts [RFC3986] for notification methods
      supported by the Sieve "enotify" [RFC5435] extension, or "null" if
      the extension is not supported by the Sieve engine.



   o  *externalLists*: "String[]|null"

      A list of URI schema parts [RFC3986] for externally stored list
      types supported by the Sieve "extlists" [RFC6134] extension, or
      "null" if the extension is not supported by the Sieve engine.

2.  Sieve Scripts

   A *SieveScript* object represents a single Sieve [RFC5228] script for
   filtering email messages at time of final delivery.

   A *SieveScript* object has the following properties:

   o  *id*: "Id" (immutable; server-set)

      The id of the script.



   o  *name*: "String|null" (optional; default is server-dependent)

      User-visible name for the SieveScript.  This MUST be a Net-Unicode
      [RFC5198] string of at least 1 character in length, subject to the
      maximum size given in the capability object.  For compatibility
      with ManageSieve, servers MUST reject names that contain control

      characters.  Servers MAY reject names that violate server policy
      (e.g., names containing slash (/)).  The name MUST be unique among
      all SieveScripts within an account.



   o  *content*: "String"

      The raw octets of the script.

      This MUST be a UTF-8 [RFC3629] string of at least 1 character in
      length, subject to the syntax of Sieve [RFC5228].  The script MUST
      NOT contain any "require" statement(s) mentioning Sieve
      capabiltity strings not present in the capability (Section 1.3.1)
      object.  Note that if the Sieve "ihave" [RFC5463] capability
      string is present in the capability object, the script MAY mention
      unrecognized/unsupported extensions in the "ihave" test.



   o  *isActive*: "Boolean" (server-set; default: false)

      A user may have multiple SieveScripts on the server, yet only one
      script may be used for filtering of incoming messages.  This is
      the active script.  Users may have zero or one active script.  The
      SieveScript/set (Section 2.2) method is used for changing the
      active script or disabling Sieve processing.



2.1.  SieveScript/get

   This is a standard "/get" method as described in [RFC8620],
   Section 5.1.  The _ids_ argument may be "null" to fetch all at once.

   This method provides similar functionality to the GETSCRIPT and
   LISTSCRIPTS commands in [RFC5804].

2.2.  SieveScript/set

   This is a standard "/set" method as described in [RFC8620],
   Section 5.3 but with the following additional request argument, which
   may be omitted:

   o  *onSuccessActivateScript*: "Id|null" (optional)

      If "null", the currently active SieveScript (if any) will be
      deactivated if and only if all of the creations, modifications,

      and destructions (if any) succeed.  Otherwise, the id of the
      SieveScript to activate if and only if all of the creations,
      modifications, and destructions (if any) succeed.  (For references
      to SieveScript creations, this is equivalent to a creation-
      reference, so the id will be the creation id prefixed with a "#".)
      If this argument is not present in the request, the currently
      active SieveScript (if any) will remain as such.

      The id of any activated SieveScript MUST be reported in either the
      "created" or "updated" argument in the response as appropriate.
      The id of any deactivated SieveScript MUST be reported in the
      "updated" argument in the response.



   This method provides similar functionality to the PUTSCRIPT,
   DELETESCRIPT, RENAMESCRIPT, and SETACTIVE commands in [RFC5804].

   If the SieveScript can not be created or updated because it would
   result in two SieveScripts with the same name, the server MUST reject
   the request with an "alreadyExists" SetError.  An "existingId"
   property of type "Id" MUST be included on the SetError object with
   the id of the existing SieveScript.

   If the SieveScript can not be created or updated because its size
   exceeds the "maxSizeScript" limit, the server MUST reject the request
   with a "tooLarge" SetError.

   If the Sieve Script can not be created because it would exceed the
   "maxNumberScripts" limit, the server MUST reject the request with an
   "overQuota" SetError.

   The active SieveScript MUST NOT be destroyed unless it is first
   deactivated in a separate SieveScript/set method call.

   The following extra SetError types are defined:

   For "create" and "update":

   o  *invalidScript*:

      The SieveScript content violates the Sieve [RFC5228] grammar and/
      or one or more extensions mentioned in the script's "require"
      statement(s) are not supported by the Sieve interpreter.  The
      _description_ property on the SetError object SHOULD contain a
      specific error message giving at least the line number of the
      first error.

   For "destroy":

   o  *scriptIsActive*:

      The SieveScript is active.

2.3.  SieveScript/query

   This is a standard "/query" method as described in [RFC8620],
   Section 5.5.  A _FilterCondition_ object has the following
   properties, either of which may be omitted:

   o  *name*: "String"

      The SieveScript "name" property contains the given string.



   o  *isActive*: "Boolean"

      The "isActive" property of the SieveScript must be identical to
      the value given to match the condition.



   The following SieveScript properties MUST be supported for sorting:

   o  *name*



   o  *isActive*

2.4.  SieveScript/validate

   This method is used by the client to verify Sieve script validity
   without storing the script on the server.

   The method provides similar functionality to the CHECKSCRIPT command
   in [RFC5804].

   The *SieveScript/validate* method takes the following arguments:

   o  *accountId*: "Id"

      The id of the account to use.



   o  *content*: "String"

      The raw octets of the script to validate, subject to the same
      requirements in Section 2.

Internet-Draft                 JMAP Sieve                  November 2020


   The response has the following arguments:

   o  *accountId*: "Id"

      The id of the account used for this call.



   o  *error*: "SetError|null"

      A SetError object if the request or the script content is invalid,
      or "null" if the script content is valid.



2.5.  SieveScript/test

   This method is used by the client to ask the Sieve interpreter to
   evaluate a Sieve script against a set of emails and report what
   actions would be performed for each.

   When calling this method the "using" property of the Request object
   MUST contain the capabilities "urn:ietf:params:jmap:sieve" and
   "urn:ietf:params:jmap:mail".  The latter is required due to the use
   of blob ids which may reference Email objects and the use of the
   Envelope object, as described below.

   The *SieveScript/test* method takes the following arguments:

   o  *accountId*: "Id"

      The id of the account to use.



   o  *scriptContent*: "String"

      The raw octets of the script to test, subject to the same
      requirements in Section 2.



   o  *scriptId*: "Id"

      The id of the SieveScript to test.

Internet-Draft                 JMAP Sieve                  November 2020


   o  *emailBlobIds*: "Id[]"

      The ids representing the raw octets of the [RFC5322] messages to
      test against.



   o  *envelope*: "Envelope|null"

      Information that the Sieve interpreter should assume was present
      in the SMTP transaction that delivered the message when evaluating
      "envelope" tests.  If "null", all "envelope" tests MUST evaluate
      to false.  See Section 7 of [RFC8621] for the contents of the
      Envelope object.



   o  *lastVacationResponse*: "UTCDate|null"

      The UTC date-time at which the Sieve interpreter should assume
      that it last auto-replied to the sender of the message, or "null"
      if the Sieve interpreter should assume that it has not auto-
      replied to the sender.



   A client MUST include either a _scriptContent_ or a _scriptId_
   property.  A request that includes neither or both properties MUST be
   rejected with an "invalidArguments" SetError.

   The response has the following arguments:

   o  *accountId*: "Id"

      The id of the account used for this call.



   o  *completed*: "Id[Action[]]|null"

      A map of the blob id to a set of _Action_ types for each message
      successfully processed by the script, or "null" if none.  The
      _Action_ data type is a tuple, represented as a JSON array
      containing two elements:



      1.  A "String" *name* of the Sieve action (e.g., "keep").

Internet-Draft                 JMAP Sieve                  November 2020


      2.  A "String[*]" object containing named *arguments* for that
          action (e.g., "flags" or "mailbox").



   o  *notCompleted*: "Id[SetError]|null"

      A map of the blob id to a SetError object for each message that
      was not successfully processed by the script, or "null" if none.
      A "serverFail" SetError (see Section 3.6.2 of [RFC8620]) MUST be
      used to indicate a Sieve interpreter run-time error.



   The following additional errors may be returned instead of the
   "SieveScript/test" response:

   o  "notFound": The script referenced by the id could not be found.

   o  "invalidScript": The script content is invalid (see Section 2.2).

   o  "serverFail": The script failed preparation to be executed for
      some other reason.


   The name to use for each action argument in the response is a direct
   mapping of the argument names as given in the specification of each
   action.  Tagged and optional arguments MUST use the name of the tag,
   minus the leading ":".  Positional arguments MUST use the name of the
   argument inside of the angle brackets ("<" and ">") in the "Usage"
   line in the specification for the action.

   The JSON data type to use for each argument value is a direct mapping
   from its Sieve data type, per the following table:

                     +-------------+----------------+
                     |  Sieve Type |   JSON Type    |
                     +-------------+----------------+
                     |    Number   |     Number     |
                     |    String   |     String     |
                     | String List |    String[]    |
                     |   no value  | Boolean (true) |
                     +-------------+----------------+

   Recommendations for constructing the list of arguments are as
   follows:

   o  Optional arguments in which the value is supplied by the Sieve
      interpreter SHOULD be included (e.g., ":from" and ":subject"
      arguments to the "vacation" [RFC5230] action).

   o  Optional arguments in which the value is implicitly supplied by a
      Sieve variable SHOULD be included (e.g., "keep" or "fileinto"
      actions without an explicit ":flags" argument, but "imap4flags"
      [RFC5232] have been set on the internal variable).

   o  Optional arguments in which the value is the specfied default MAY
      be omitted.

   o  Tagged arguments that are only used to determine whether the
      action will be executed and have no impact on the result of the
      action MAY be omitted (e.g., ":days" and ":addresses" arguments to
      the vacation action).

2.5.1.  Example

   Assume that the following script has been created and assigned id
   "S123".

   require [ "imapflags", "editheader", "vacation", "fcc" ];
   setflag "$SieveFiltered";
   addheader :last "X-Sieve-Filtered" "yes";
   vacation :days 3 :fcc "INBOX.Sent" :flags "\\Answered" text:
   Gone fishing.
   .
   ;

   Assume that the following email has been uploaded and assigned blob
   id "B456".

   From: "Some Example Sender" <example@example.net>
   To: ken@example.com
   Subject: test email
   Date: Wed, 23 Sep 2020 12:11:11 -0500
