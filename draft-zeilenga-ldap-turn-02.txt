INTERNET-DRAFT         draft-zeilenga-ldap-turn-02      10 February 2005


  This specification describes a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
  (LDAP) extended operation to reverse (or "turn") the roles of client
  and server for subsequent protocol exchanges in the session, or to
  enable each peer to act as both client and server with respect to the
  other.


1. Background and Intent of Use

  The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [Roadmap][Protocol]
  is a client-server protocol which typically operates over reliable
  octet-stream transports such as the Transport Control Protocol (TCP).
  Generally, the client initiates the stream by connecting to the
  server's listener at some well-known address.

  There are cases where it is desirable for the server to initiate the
  stream.  While it certainly is possible to write a technical
  specification detailing how to implement server-initiated LDAP
  sessions, this would require the design of new authentication and
  other security mechanisms to support server-initiated LDAP sessions.

  Instead, this document introduces an operation, the Turn operation,
  which may be used to reverse the client-servers roles of the protocol
  peers.  This allows the initiating protocol peer to become server
  (after the reversal).

  As an additional feature, the Turn operation may be used to allow both
  peers to act in both roles.  This is useful where both peers are
  directory servers that desire to request, as LDAP clients, operations
  be performed by the other.  This may be useful in replicated and/or
  distributed environments.

  This operation is intended to be used between protocol peers which
  have established a mutual agreement, by means outside of the protocol,
  which requires reversal of client-server roles, or allows both peers
  to act both as client and server.


1.1 Terminology

  Protocol elements are described using ASN.1 [X.680] with implicit
  tags.  The term "BER-encoded" means the element is to be encoded using
  the Basic Encoding Rules [X.690] under the restrictions detailed in
  Section 5.2 of [Protocol].

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

2. Turn Operation

  The Turn operation is defined as a LDAP Extended Operation [Protocol,
  Section 4.12] identified by the IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.  The function of
  the Turn Operation is to request that the client-server roles be
  reversed, or, optionally to request that both protocol peers to be
  able to act both as client and server in respect to the other.


2.1. Turn Request

  The Turn request is an ExtendedRequest with the requestName field
  containing the IANA-ASSIGNED-OID and a requestValue field is a
  BER-encoded turnValue:

       turnValue ::= SEQUENCE {
            mutual         BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
            identifier     LDAPString,
       }

  A TRUE mutual field value indicates a request to allow both peers to
  act both as client and server.  A FALSE mutual field value indicates a
  request to reserve the client and server roles.

  The value of the identifier field is a locally-defined policy
  identifier (typically associated with a mutual agreement for which
  this turn is be executed as part of).


2.2. Turn Response

  A Turn response is an ExtendedResponse where the responseName and
  responseValue fields are absent.  A resultCode of success is returned
  if and only if the responder is willing and able to turn the session
  as requested.  Otherwise, a different resultCode is returned.


3. Security Considerations

  It is generally recommended that before issuing the Turn operation the
  protocol peers:

    - establish each other's identities through appropriate
      authentication mechanism,
    - establish appropriate data integrity, data confidentiality, and
      other protections,
    - establish an LDAP association between the initiating peer and the
      responding peer.

INTERNET-DRAFT         draft-zeilenga-ldap-turn-02      10 February 2005


  And upon successful completion of turn:
    - establish an LDAP association in the reverse.

  That is, for peer A connecting to the listening peer B and where TLS
  and SASL/EXTERNAL were to be used, the sequence of LDAP messages could
  be:

      A->B: StartTLS Request
      B->A: StartTLS(success) Response
      A->B: Bind(SASL(EXTERNAL)) Request
      B->A: Bind(success) Response
      A->B: Turn(TRUE,"XXYYZ") Request
      B->A: Turn(success) Response
      B->A: Bind(SASL(EXTERNAL)) Request
      A->B: Bind(success) Response
