1.  Introduction

   RFC 1035 [RFC1035] specifies the wire format for DNS messages.  It
   also specifies DNS transport on UDP and TCP on port 53, which is
   still used today.  However, there are other ways to access DNS
   database, for example in a different data format or via alternative
   DNS transport.  These approaches are summarized in [draft-shane-
   review-DNS-over-http].

   One of alternative way of DNS described in that document is to
   transport DNS binary data inside HTTP, with the goal of improving DNS
   service availability.  The DNS traffic is simply sent as web traffic
   using port 80/443 over HTTP.  It can bypass badly behaving middle
   boxes like firewalls, proxies or traffic shaping devices on path
   which might interfere with normal DNS traffic [RFC5625] [DOTSE]
   [SAC035].

   This approach has the advantage that HTTP usually makes it through
   even the worst coffee shop or hotel room firewalls, as Internet users
   expect web browsing to always work.  It also benefits from HTTP's
   support for persistent TCP connections (see section 6.3 in
   [RFC7230]).  Note that 5966bis [I-D.ietf-dnsop-5966bis] specifies the
   persistent feature for DNS on TCP port 53, but current DNS software
   does not generally support this mode of operation.  Finally, HTTPS
   provides data integrity and privacy.

   Unlike a REST DNS API using JSON [I-D.bortzmeyer-dns-json] or XML
   [I-D.mohan-dns-query-xml] encoding for DNS data, in this approach
   wire-format data is wrapped with a HTTP header and transmitted on
   port 80 or 443.  This protocol is not designed with web developers or
   advanced usage in application development in mind.  It simply serves
   as a sort of DNS VPN, and does not introduce another format of DNS
   data.

   This memo aims to describe how the DNS binary over HTTP concept
   works.  Hopefully implementations by different developers following
   this memo can speak with each other.

   This mechanism is designed for client stub resolver to recursive
   server.  DNS zone transfer, DNS updates, and anything other than
   simple DNS queries are out-of-scope for this document.

2.  Methodology and Configuration

   As mentioned in introduction, the basic methodology is wrapping the
   DNS wire-format data into an HTTP header and transmitting on port 80
   or 443.  However, there are two different scenarios for
   implementation.

   Scenario 1:

   The DNS server implementation handles DNS queries and responses via
   both UDP and TCP on port 53, and HTTP on port 80 or 443.  It works as
   follows:

   1.  The client creates a DNS query message.

   2.  The client encapsulates the DNS message in a HTTP message body
       and assigns parameters with the HTTP header.

   3.  The client connects to the server and issues an HTTP POST request
       method.  This may re-use an existing HTTP connection.

   4.  The server decapsulates the HTTP packet to get the DNS query, and
       resolves the DNS query.

   5.  The server encapsulates the DNS response in HTTP and sends it
       back via the HTTP session.

   Scenario 2:

   In this scenario there is a DNS-HTTP proxy sitting between stub-
   resolver and the recursive server.  The stub uses a client proxy and
   the recursive server uses a server proxy.  This works like a DNS VPN
   and transmits wire-format DNS messages over HTTP between the proxy
   client and a server, as follows:

   1.  The stub-resolver sends a DNS query (over UDP or TCP) to the
       proxy client.

   2.  The proxy client encapsulates the DNS message in an HTTP message
       body and assigns parameters with the HTTP header.

   3.  The proxy client connects to the proxy server and issues an HTTP
       POST request method.  This may re-use an existing HTTP
       connection.

   4.  The proxy server decapsulates the HTTP packet to get the DNS
       query, and sends it to a real DNS server over UDP/TCP.

   5.  The proxy server encapsulates the DNS response in HTTP and sends
       it back via the HTTP session.

   6.  The proxy client decapsulates the DNS message from the HTTP
       response and sends it back to the stub-resolver via previous DNS
       session (either UDP or TCP).

   Note that the proxy client can be implemented listening to a loop-
   back address in the same host with stub-resolver.  The proxy server
   can be implemented as a caching server as well.  It is also possible
   to use the proxy server as a regular web server at the same time that
   is is acting as a proxy server.

3.  DNS-over-HTTP Message Format

   Although this document simply proposes that HTTP be used for DNS
   massage exchange, it is informative to explore the context with HTTP-
   specific semantics, such as the HTTP request method, specific
   request-target, HTTP-version, and HTTP header field, all of which
   have impact on interoperability as well as performance.

   In HTTP 1.1 specification section 3 in RFC 7230 [RFC7230], an HTTP
   message consists of three parts: start-line, header fields, and
   message body with an empty line between header fields and message
   body.  The DNS over HTTP message also contains these parts.

3.1.  Start-line

   By definition the HTTP start-line is either a request-line (for
   requests) or a status-line (for responses).  A request-line consists
   of the request method, request-target, and HTTP-version with a CRLF
   in the end.

   For a DNS query over HTTP, the request is always POST [section 4.3.3
   in RFC 7230 [RFC7230]].  Note if a GET is sent to the server, it
   optionally returns a human-readable page showing its web server
   environment.

   Usually the target URI is provides explicitly by the DNS services
   provider.  Derived from the target URI, the request-target in
   request-line identifies the target resource upon which to apply the

Internet-Draft          DNS wire-format over HTTP          February 2016


   request.  In the case of DNS query over HTTP, one approach is to
   always use a fixed string for request-target by default, like "/dns-
   over-http".  It works if there is no other resource sharing the same
   request-target name, otherwise there may be a conflict.  Another
   approach is to allow the server to use a defined URI which contains
   the specific request-target.  Note in the BII proxy implementation,
   we use "/proxy_dns" for this purpose.

   DNS transaction over HTTP has no specific requirement for transport
   protocol; developers can use any version of HTTP to accomplish the
   transaction.  But developers should be aware that HTTP/1.1 RFC 7230
   [RFC7230] and HTTP/2 RFC 7540 [RFC7540] do have differences in
   performance regarding multiplexing.  HTTP/2 is fully multiplexed,
   instead of ordered and blocking.  Because there is a general desire
   to achieve similar performance with DNS over UDP, the modern HTTP/2
   is preferred for DNS over HTTP implementation.  Note that there
   should be no problem for advanced HTTP protocol in the future
   deployed for DNS over HTTP.

   For example, given HTTP-version is "HTTP/1.1".  So the request-line
   is :

   POST /dns-over-http HTTP/1.1

   The status-line returns the status-code [Section 6 of RFC 7231
   [RFC7231]], which only reflects status of HTTP connection.  If the
   request has succeeded, the status-line is:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK

   If the request fails, the proxy server will supply an appropriate
   error code, typically 4xx (client error) if the client has provided a
   query that the server cannot understand for some reasons, or 5xx
   (server error) if some server-side problem prevented a query from
   succeeding.

3.2.  Header Fields

   By definition header fields are key:value pairs that can be used to
   communicate data about the message, its payload, the target resource,
   or the connection (for example control data).  Considering the proxy
   configuration in scenario 2, we use a new header field:

   Proxy-DNS-Transport: xyz

   Where xyz is either UDP or TCP, which is the client's indication of
   how it received the underlying DNS query, and which the server will
   use when sending the query to the far-end DNS server.  This means if

Internet-Draft          DNS wire-format over HTTP          February 2016


   a stub DNS client asks for TCP, then that's what the far-end DNS
   server will see, and likewise for UDP.  This header field is used for
   both request and response, for all DNS over HTTP message.

   Exposing the transport protocol of the query allows the HTTP server
   proxy to send DNS queries to the recursive resolver that look like
   those that the DNS client is sending to the client proxy.  If the
   stub resolver sent a UDP packet, then this allows the recursive
   resolver to implement the logic of truncating the packet properly,
   instead of requiring that the HTTP client proxy somehow manage that
   functionality.

   For a stub resolver that connect directly via HTTP to the HTTP server
   proxy then this flag is not necessary, as the entire response can
   always be delivered so truncation is never required.

3.3.  Message Body

   As mentioned, the message body is DNS wire-format data.

   It is worth mentioning that DNS messages sent over TCP connections is
   prefixed with a two-byte length field which gives the message
   length[section 4.2.2 in RFC 1035 [RFC1035]], excluding the two-byte
   length field.  This length field allows the low-level processing to
   assemble a complete message before beginning to parse it.  In the
   context of HTTP, there is content-length header field [section 3.3.2
   in RFC 7230 [RFC7230]]in which the field-value is the same with two
   bytes length field in DNS over TCP.

   Since this two-byte length field is redundant, when the client proxy
   receives a DNS message over TCP, it does NOT include the length field
   in the message sent to the server.  The length in the content-length
   header is only the size of the DNS message itself, and does NOT
   include this two-byte length header.

4.  Considerations on DNS over HTTPS

   HTTPS is recommended for communication.  It provides privacy and
   integrity for HTTP sessions.

   As specified in RFC 5246 [RFC5246], both the DNS server and client
   can be authenticated or not authenticated.  The DNS service providers
   can decide authenticated pattern on both server and client sides
   based on their own requirement for security and privacy.  For an open
   resolver, clients do not require authentication.
