                   OSPF Transport Instance Extensions
               draft-ietf-lsr-ospf-transport-instance-00

Abstract

   OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 include a reliable flooding mechanism to
   disseminate routing topology and Traffic Engineering (TE) information
   within a routing domain.  Given the effectiveness of these
   mechanisms, it is convenient to envision using the same mechanism for
   dissemination of other types of information within the domain.
   However, burdening OSPF with this additional information will impact
   intra-domain routing convergence and possibly jeopardize the
   stability of the OSPF routing domain.  This document presents
   mechanism to relegate this ancillary information to a separate OSPF
   instance and minimize the impact.

1.  Introduction

   OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3 [RFC5340] include a reliable flooding
   mechanism to disseminate routing topology and Traffic Engineering
   (TE) information within a routing domain.  Given the effectiveness of
   these mechanisms, it is convenient to envision using the same
   mechanism for dissemination of other types of information within the
   domain.  However, burdening OSPF with this additional information
   will impact intra-domain routing convergence and possibly jeopardize
   the stability of the OSPF routing domain.  This document presents
   mechanism to relegate this ancillary information to a separate OSPF
   instance and minimize the impact.

   This OSPF protocol extension provides functionality similar to
   "Advertising Generic Information in IS-IS" [RFC6823].  Additionally,
   OSPF is extended to support sparse non-routing overlay topologies
   Section 4.7.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Possible Use Cases

3.1.  MEC Service Discovery

   Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) plays an important role in 5G
   architecture.  MEC optimizes the performance for ultra-low latency
   and high bandwidth services by providing networking and computing at
   the edge of the network [ETSI-WP28-MEC].  To achieve this goal, it's
   important to expose the network capabilities and services of a MEC
   device to 5G User Equipment UE, i.e. UEs.

   The followings are an incomplete list of the kind of information that
   OSPF transport instance can help to disseminate:

   o  A network service is realized using one or more physical or
      virtualized hosts in MEC, and the locations of these service
      points might change.  The auto-discovery of these service
      locations can be achieved using an OSPF transport instance.

Internet-Draft           OSPF Transport Instance                May 2021


   o  UEs might be mobile, and MEC should support service continuity and
      application mobility.  This may require service state transferring
      and synchronization.  OSPF transport instance can be used to
      synchronize these states.

   o  Network resources are limited, such as computing power, storage.
      The availability of such resources is dynamic, and OSPF transport
      instance can be used to populate such information, so applications
      can pick the right location of such resources, hence improve user
      experience and resource utilization.

3.2.  Application Data Dissemination

   Typically a network consists of routers from different vendors with
   different capabilities, and some applications may want to know
   whether a router supports certain functionality or where to find a
   router supports a functionality, so it will be ideal if such kind of
   information is known to all routers or a group of routers in the
   network.  For example, an ingress router needs to find an egress
   router that supports In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (IFIT)
   [I-D.wang-lsr-igp-extensions-ifit] and obtain IFIT parameters.

   OSPF transport instance can be used to populate such router
   capabilities/functionalities without impacting the performance or
   convergence of the base OSPF protocol.

3.3.  Intra-Area Topology for BGP-LS Distribution

   In some cases, it is desirable to limit the number of BGP-LS
   [RFC5572] sessions with a controller to the a one or two routers in
   an OSPF domain.  However, many times those router(s) do not have full
   visibility to the complete topology of all the areas.  To solve this
   problem without extended the BGP-LS domain, the OSPF LSAs for non-
   local area could be flooded over the OSPF transport instance topology
   using remote neighbors Section 4.7.1.

4.  OSPF Transport Instance

   In order to isolate the effects of flooding and processing of non-
   routing information, it will be relegated to a separate protocol
   instance.  This instance should be given lower priority when
   contending for router resources including processing, backplane
   bandwidth, and line card bandwidth.  How that is realized is an
   implementation issue and is outside the scope of this document.

   Throughout the document, non-routing refers to routing information
   that is not used for IP or IPv6 routing calculations.  The OSPF

Internet-Draft           OSPF Transport Instance                May 2021


   transport instance is ideally suited for dissemination of routing
   information for other protocols and layers.

4.1.  OSPFv2 Transport Instance Packet Differentiation

   OSPFv2 currently does not offer a mechanism to differentiate
   Transport instance packets from normal instance packets sent and
   received on the same interface.  However, the [RFC6549] provides the
   necessary packet encoding to support multiple OSPF protocol
   instances.

4.2.  OSPFv3 Transport Instance Packet Differentiation

   Fortunately, OSPFv3 already supports separate instances within the
   packet encodings.  The existing OSPFv3 packet header instance ID
   field will be used to differentiate packets received on the same link
   (refer to section 2.4 in [RFC5340]).

4.3.  Instance Relationship to Normal OSPF Instances

   In OSPF transport instance, we must guarantee that any information
   we've received is treated as valid if and only if the router sending
   it is reachable.  We'll refer to this as the "condition of
   reachability" in this document.

   The OSPF transport instance is not dependent on any other OSPF
   instance.  It does, however, have much of the same as topology
   information must be advertised to satisfy the "condition of
   reachability".

   Further optimizations and coupling between an OSPF transport instance
   and a normal OSPF instance are beyond the scope of this document.
   This is an area for future study.

4.4.  Network Prioritization

   While OSPFv2 (section 4.3 in [RFC2328]) are normally sent with IP
   precedence Internetwork Control, any packets sent by an OSPF
   transport instance will be sent with IP precedence Flash (B'011').
   This is only appropriate given that this is a pretty flashy
   mechanism.

   Similarly, OSPFv3 transport instance packets will be sent with the
   traffic class mapped to flash (B'011') as specified in ([RFC5340]).

   By setting the IP/IPv6 precedence differently for OSPF transport
   instance packets, normal OSPF routing instances can be given priority
   during both packet transmission and reception.  In fact, some router



Lindem, et al.          Expires November 22, 2021               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           OSPF Transport Instance                May 2021


   implementations map the IP precedence directly to their internal
   packet priority.  However, internal router implementation decisions
   are beyond the scope of this document.

4.5.  OSPF Transport Instance Omission of Routing Calculation

   Since the whole point of the transport instance is to separate the
   routing and non-routing processing and fate sharing, a transport
   instance SHOULD NOT install any IP or IPv6 routes.  OSPF routers
   SHOULD NOT advertise any transport instance LSAs containing IP or
   IPv6 prefixes and OSPF routers receiving LSAs advertising IP or IPv6
   prefixes SHOULD ignore them.  This implies that an OSPF transport
   instance Link State Database should not include any of the LSAs as
   shown in Table 1.

               LSAs not included in OSPF transport instance

   If these LSAs are erroneously advertised, they will be flooded as per
   standard OSPF but MUST be ignored by OSPF routers supporting this
   specification.

4.6.  Non-routing Instance Separation

   It has been suggested that an implementation could obtain the same
   level of separation between IP routing information and non-routing
   information in a single instance with slight modifications to the
   OSPF protocol.  The authors refute this contention for the following
   reasons:

   o  Adding internal and external mechanisms to prioritize routing
      information over non-routing information are much more complex



Lindem, et al.          Expires November 22, 2021               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           OSPF Transport Instance                May 2021


      than simply relegating the non-routing information to a separate
      instance as proposed in this specification.

   o  The instance boundary offers much better separation for allocation
      of finite resources such as buffers, memory, processor cores,
      sockets, and bandwidth.

   o  The instance boundary decreases the level of fate sharing for
      failures.  Each instance may be implemented as a separate process
      or task.

   o  With non-routing information, many times not every router in the
      OSPF routing domain requires knowledge of every piece of non-
      routing information.  In these cases, groups of routers which need
      to share information can be segregated into sparse topologies
      greatly reducing the amount of non-routing information any single
      router needs to maintain.

4.7.  Non-Routing Sparse Topologies

   With non-routing information, many times not every router in the OSPF
   routing domain requires knowledge of every piece of non-routing
   information.  In these cases, groups of routers which need to share
   information can be segregated into sparse topologies.  This will
   greatly reduce the amount of information any single router needs to
   maintain with the core routers possibly not requiring any non-routing
   information at all.

   With normal OSPF, every router in an OSPF area must have every piece
   of topological information and every intra-area IP or IPv6 prefix.
   With non-routing information, only the routers needing to share a set
   of information need be part of the corresponding sparse topology.
   For directly attached routers, one only needs to configure the
   desired topologies on the interfaces with routers requiring the non-
   routing information.  When the routers making up the sparse topology
   are not part of a uniconnected graph, two alternatives exist.  The
   first alternative is configure tunnels to form a fully connected
   graph including only those routers in the sparse topology.  The
   second alternative is use remote neighbors as described in
   Section 4.7.1.

4.7.1.  Remote OSPF Neighbor

   With sparse topologies, OSPF routers sharing non-routing information
   may not be directly connected.  OSPF adjacencies with remote
   neighbors are formed exactly as they are with regular OSPF neighbors.
   The main difference is that a remote OSPF neighbor's address is
   configured and IP routing is used to deliver OSPF protocol packets to



Lindem, et al.          Expires November 22, 2021               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           OSPF Transport Instance                May 2021


   the remote neighbor.  Other salient feature of the remote neighbor
   include:

   o  All OSPF packets have the remote neighbor's configured IP address
      as the IP destination address.

   o  The adjacency is represented in the router Router-LSA as a router
      (type-1) link with the link data set to the remote neighbor's
      configured IP address.

   o  Similar to NBMA networks, a poll-interval is configured to
      determine if the remote neighbor is reachable.  This value is
      normally much higher than the hello interval with 40 seconds
      RECOMMENDED as the default.

4.8.  Multiple Topologies

   For some applications, the information need to be flooded only to a
   topology which is a subset of routers of the transport instance.
   This allows the application specific information only to be flooded
   to routers that support the application.  A transport instance may
   support multiple topologies as defined in [RFC4915].  But as pointed
   out in Section 4.5, a transport instance or topology SHOULD NOT
   install any IP or IPv6 routes.

   Each topology associated with the transport instance MUST be fully
   connected in order for the LSAs to be successfully flooded to all
   routers in the topology.

5.  OSPF Transport Instance Information (TII) Encoding

5.1.  OSPFv2 Transport Instance Information Encoding

   Application specific information will be flooded in opaque LSAs as
   specified in [RFC5250].  An Opaque LSA option code will be reserved
   for Transport Instance Information (TII) as described in Section 8.
   The TII LSA can be advertised at any of the defined flooding scopes
   (link, area, or autonomous system (AS)).

   Application specific information will be flooded in separate LSAs
   with a separate function code.  Refer to section A.4.2.1 of

   section 2 of [RFC8362] for OSPFv3 extended LSA types.  An OSPFv3
   function code will be reserved for Transport Instance Information
   (TII) as described in Section 8.  Same as OSPFv2, the TII LSA can be
   advertised at any of the defined flooding scopes (link, area, or
   autonomous system (AS)).  The U bit will be set indicating that
   OSPFv3 TTI LSAs should be flooded even if it is not understood.

                 OSPFv3 Transport Instance Information LSA

   The format of the TLVs within the body of an TII LSA is as defined in
   Section 5.3.

5.3.  Transport Instance Information (TII) TLV Encoding

   The format of the TLVs within the body of the LSAs containing non-
   routing information is the same as the format used by the Traffic
   Engineering Extensions to OSPF [RFC3630].  The LSA payload consists
   of one or more nested Type/Length/Value (TLV) triplets.  The format
   of each TLV is:


      0                   1                   2                   3

                                TLV Format

5.3.1.  Top-Level TII Application TLV

   An Application top-level TLV will be used to encapsulate application
   data advertised within TII LSAs.  This top-level TLV may be used to
   handle the local publication/subscription for application specific

   data.  The details of such a publication/subscription mechanism are
   beyond the scope of this document.  An Application ID is used in the
   top-level application TLV and shares the same code point with IS-IS
   as defined in [RFC6823].

     Application ID:
       An identifier assigned to this application via the IANA registry,
       as defined in RFC 6823. Each unique application will have a
       unique ID.

     Additional Application-Specific Sub-TLVs:
       Additional information defined by applications can be encoded as
       Sub-TLVs. Definition of such information is beyond the scope of
       this document.

                               Top-Level TLV

   The specific TLVs and sub-TLVs relating to a given application and
   the corresponding IANA considerations MUST be specified in the
   document corresponding to that application.

6.  Manageability Considerations

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the Transport Instance will not be
   different for those for OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3 [RFC5340].

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  OSPFv2 Opaque LSA Type Assignment

   IANA is requested to assign an option type, TBD1, for Transport
   Instance Information (TII) LSA from the "Opaque Link-State
   Advertisements (LSA) Option Types" registry.

8.2.  OSPFv3 LSA Function Code Assignment

   IANA is requested to assign a function code, TBD2, for Transport
   Instance Information (TII) LSAs from the "OSPFv3 LSA Function Codes"
   registry.

8.3.  OSPF Transport Instance Information Top-Level TLV Registry

   IANA is requested to create a registry for OSPF Transport Instance
   Information (TII) Top-Level TLVs.  The first available TLV (1) is
   assigned to the Application TLV Section 5.3.1.  The allocation of the
   unsigned 16-bit TLV type are defined in the table below.
