1.  Introduction

   Using web servers as "gossip pools" is expected to be helpful for
   transparency gossiping, especially for [RFC6962].

   Web browsers can act as an HTTPS transport, sending and receiving
   gossip messages to web servers it connects to for other reasons than
   gossiping.

   HTTPS transports that don't have connections to web servers for other
   reasons than gossiping may connect to web servers known to support
   gossiping.  They can be known by configuration or by other
   mechanisms.  This document does not specify such mechanisms.

2.  Sending and receiving

   Gossip messages may contain sensitive information and MUST NOT be
   sent over connections which are not encrypted as described in
   [RFC2817] or [RFC2818] using TLS version 1.0 or higher.  When
   applicable the server SHOULD be authenticated using X.509
   certificates as described in [RFC2459] or by other means.

   HTTPS gossip messages are sent in [RFC2616] message headers with the
   field-name "TransGossip".

   An HTTPS transport

   o  SHOULD send gossip messages to HTTP servers that have indicated
      that they accept gossip by sending an HTTP response-header
      "TransGossipEnabled" with the value "Yes"

   o  MAY send gossip messages to HTTP servers that haven't indicated
      willingness to accept gossip

   o  MUST NOT send gossip messages to HTTP servers that have indicated
      that they don't accept gossip by sending an HTTP response-header
      "TransGossipEnabled" with the value "No"

3.  Message format and processing

   Messages are strings of US-ASCII data on the following form:

   <protocol-version>:<log-id>:<gossip-data>

   'protocol-version' is the version number of the protocol in decimal.
   This version is 0.

   'log-id' and 'gossip-data' are as defined in the GOSSIP-MSG of
   [draft-linus-trans-gossip].  Note that 'gossip-data' is
   base64-encoded.

   Messages MUST be processed according to [draft-linus-trans-gossip].

   [FIXME are there any http specific processing rules to be added?]

4.  Security considerations

   TBD

5.  IANA considerations

   TBD
