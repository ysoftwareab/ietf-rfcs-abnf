Introduction</h3>

<p>The original idea and the name of the mechanism (6rd) described
   in <a class='info' href='#RFC5569'>[RFC5569]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Despres, R., &ldquo;IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (6rd),&rdquo; January&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> details a successful commercial
   "rapid deployment" of the 6rd mechanism by a residential Service
   Provider and is recommended reading. This document describes the
   6rd mechanism, extended for use in more general environments, and
   intended for advancement on the IETF Standards Track. Throughout
   this document, the term 6to4 is used to refer to the mechanism
   described in <a class='info' href='#RFC3056'>[RFC3056]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Carpenter, B. and K. Moore, &ldquo;Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> and 6rd the mechanism
   defined herein.
</p>
<p>6rd specifies a protocol mechanism to deploy IPv6 to sites via a
   Service Provider's (SP's) IPv4 network. It builds on 6to4 <a class='info' href='#RFC3056'>[RFC3056]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Carpenter, B. and K. Moore, &ldquo;Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>, with the key differentiator that it
   utilizes an SP's own IPv6 address prefix rather than a well known
   prefix (2002::/16). By using the SP's IPv6 prefix, the operational
   domain of 6rd is limited to the SP network and under its direct
   control. From the perspective of customer sites and the IPv6
   Internet at large, the IPv6 service provided is equivalent to
   native IPv6.
</p>
<p>The 6rd mechanism relies upon an algorithmic mapping between the
   IPv6 and IPv4 addresses that are assigned for use within the SP
   network. This mapping allows for automatic determination of IPv4
   tunnel endpoints from IPv6 prefixes, allowing stateless operation
   of 6rd. 6rd views the IPv4 network as a link layer for IPv6 and
   supports an automatic tunneling abstraction similar to the
   Non-Broadcast Multiple Access (NBMA) model.
</p>
<p>A 6rd domain consists of 6rd Customer Edge (CE) routers and one
   or more 6rd Border Relays (BRs). IPv6 packets encapsulated by 6rd
   follow the IPv4 routing topology within the SP network among CEs
   and BRs. 6rd BRs are traversed only for IPv6 packets that are
   destined to or are arriving from outside the SP's 6rd domain. As
   6rd is stateless, BRs may be reached using anycast for failover and
   resiliency (in a similar fashion to <a class='info' href='#RFC3068'>[RFC3068]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huitema, C., &ldquo;An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>On the "customer-facing" (i.e., "LAN") side of a CE, IPv6 is
   implemented as it would be for any native IP service delivered by
   the SP and further considerations for IPv6 operation on the
   LAN-side of the CE is out of scope for this document. On the
   "SP-Facing" (i.e., "WAN") side of the 6rd CE, the WAN interface
   itself, encapsulation over Ethernet, ATM or PPP, as well as control
   protocols such as PPPoE, IPCP, DHCP, etc. all remain unchanged from
   current IPv4 operation. Although 6rd was designed primarily to
   support IPv6 deployment to a customer site (such as a residential
   home network) by an SP, it can equally be applied to an individual
   IPv6 host acting as a CE.
</p>
<p>6rd relies on IPv4 and is designed to deliver production-quality
   IPv6 alongside IPv4 with as little change to IPv4 networking and
   operations as possible. Native IPv6 deployment within the SP
   network itself may continue for the SP's own purposes aside of
   delivering IPv6 service to sites supported by 6rd. Once the SP
   network and operations can support fully native IPv6 access and
   transport, 6rd may be discontinued.
</p>
<p>6rd utilizes the same encapsulation and base mechanism as 6to4
   and could in fact be viewed as a superset of 6to4. 6to4 service can
   be made with 6rd by setting the 6rd prefix to 2002::/16. Unlike
   6to4, 6rd is for use only in an environment where a service
   provider cooperates closely to deliver the IPv6 service. 6to4
   routes with the 2002::/16 prefix may exist alongside 6rd in the 6rd
   CE router, and doing so may offer some efficiencies when
   communicating directly with 6to4 routers.
</p>
<p>The 6rd link model can be extended to support IPv6
   multicast. IPv6 multicast support is left for future
   consideration.
</p>
<p>How this mechanism should be used and other deployment and
   operational considerations is considered out of scope for this
   document.

Terminology</h3>

<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>6rd prefix</dt>
<dd>An IPv6 prefix selected by the Service
       Provider for use by a 6rd domain. There is exactly one 6rd
       prefix for a given 6rd domain. An SP may deploy 6rd with a
       single 6rd domain or multiple 6rd domains.
</dd>
<dt>6rd Customer Edge</dt>
<dd>A 6rd CE is a device
       functioning as a Customer Edge in a 6rd deployment. In a
       residential broadband deployment this type of device is
       sometimes referred to as a "Residential Gateway (RG)," or
       "Customer Premises Equipment" (CPE). A typical CE router
       serving a residential site has one CE WAN side interface, one
       or more CE LAN side interfaces, and a 6rd virtual interface. A
       6rd CE may also be referred to simply as a "CE" within the
       context of 6rd. 
</dd>
<dt>6rd delegated prefix</dt>
<dd>The IPv6 prefix calculated
       by the CE for use within the customer site by combining the 6rd
       prefix and the CE IPv4 address obtained via IPv4 configuration
       methods. This prefix can be considered logically equivalent to
       a DHCPv6 IPv6 delegated prefix <a class='info' href='#RFC3633'>[RFC3633]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Troan, O. and R. Droms, &ldquo;IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>. 
</dd>
<dt>6rd domain</dt>
<dd>A set of 6rd CEs and BRs connected to
       the same virtual 6rd link. A Service Provider may deploy 6rd
       with a single 6rd domain, or may utilize multiple 6rd
       domains. Each domain requires a separate 6rd prefix.
</dd>
<dt>CE LAN side</dt>
<dd> The functionality of a 6rd CE that
       serves the "Local Area Network (LAN)" or "customer-facing" side
       of the CE. The CE LAN side interface is fully IPv6 enabled.
</dd>
<dt>CE WAN side</dt>
<dd>
       The functionality of a 6rd CE that serves the "Wide Area
       Network (WAN)" or "Service Provider-facing" side of the CE. The
       CE WAN side is IPv4-only.
</dd>
<dt>6rd Border Relay (BR)</dt>
<dd>A 6rd-enabled router
       managed by the service provider at the edge of a 6rd domain. A
       border relay router has at least one of each of the following:
       an IPv4-enabled interface, a 6rd virtual interface acting as an
       endpoint for the 6rd IPv6 in IPv4 tunnel, and an IPv6 interface
       connected to the native IPv6 network. A 6rd BR may also be
       referred to simply as a "BR" within the context of 6rd.
</dd>
<dt>BR IPv4 address</dt>
<dd>The IPv4 address of the 6rd
       Border Relay for a given 6rd domain. This IPv4 address is used
       by the CE to send packets to a BR in order to reach IPv6
       destinations outside of the 6rd domain.
</dd>
<dt>6rd virtual interface</dt>
<dd> Internal multi-point
       tunnel interface where 6rd encapsulation and decapsulation of
       IPv6 packets inside IPv4 occurs. A typical CE or BR
       implementation requires only one 6rd virtual interface. A BR
       operating in multiple 6rd domains may require more than one 6rd
       virtual interface, but no more than one per 6rd domain.
</dd>
<dt>CE IPv4 address</dt>
<dd>The IPv4 address given to the CE
       as part of normal IPv4 Internet access (i.e., configured via
       DHCP, PPP, or otherwise). This address may be global or private
       <a class='info' href='#RFC1918'>[RFC1918]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rekhter, Y., Moskowitz, R., Karrenberg, D., Groot, G., and E. Lear, &ldquo;Address Allocation for Private Internets,&rdquo; February&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> within the 6rd domain. This
       address is used by a 6rd CE to create the 6rd delegated prefix
       as well as to send and receive IPv4-encapsulated IPv6
       packets.

6rd Prefix Delegation</h3>

<p>The 6rd delegated prefix for use at a customer site is created
   by combining the 6rd prefix and all or part of the CE IPv4
   address. From these elements, the 6rd delegated prefix is
   automatically created by the CE for the customer site when IPv4
   service is obtained. This 6rd delegated prefix is used in the same
   manner as a prefix obtained via DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation <a class='info' href='#RFC3633'>[RFC3633]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Troan, O. and R. Droms, &ldquo;IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>In 6to4, a similar operation is performed by incorporating an
   entire IPv4 address at a fixed location following a well-known /16
   IPv6 prefix. In 6rd, the IPv6 prefix as well as the position and
   number of bits of the IPv4 address incorporated varies from one 6rd
   domain to the next. 6rd allows the SP to adjust the size of the 6rd
   prefix, how many bits used by the 6rd mechanism, and how many bits
   are left to be delegated to customer sites. To allow for stateless
   address auto-configuration on the CE LAN side, a 6rd delegated
   prefix SHOULD be /64 or shorter.
</p>
<p>The 6rd delegated prefix is created by concatenating the 6rd
   prefix and a consecutive set of bits from the CE IPv4 address in
   order. The sum of the number of bits used by each determines the
   size of the prefix that is delegated to the CE.
</p>
<p>The figure shows the format of an IPv6 address (section 2.5.4 of
   <a class='info' href='#RFC4291'>[RFC4291]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hinden, R. and S. Deering, &ldquo;IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>) with a 6rd prefix and an embedded

<p>For example, if the 6rd prefix is /32 and 24 bits of the CE IPv4
   address is used (e.g all CE IPv4 addresses can be aggregated by a
   10.0.0.0/8), then the size of the 6rd delegated prefix for
   each CE is automatically calculated to be /56 (32 + 24 = 56).
</p>
<p>Embedding less than the full 32 bits of a CE IPv4 address is
   possible only when an aggregated block of IPv4 addresses is
   available for a given 6rd domain. This may not be practical with
   global IPv4 addresses, but is quite likely in a deployment where
   private addresses are being assigned to CEs. If private addresses
   overlap within a given 6rd deployment, the deployment may be
   divided into separate 6rd domains, likely along the same topology
   lines the NAT-based IPv4 deployment itself would require. In this
   case, each domain is addressed with a different 6rd prefix.
</p>
<p>Each 6rd domain may use a different encoding of the embedded
   IPv4 address, even within the same service provider. For example,
   if multiple IPv4 address blocks with different levels of
   aggregation are used at the same service provider, the number of
   IPv4 bits needed to encode the 6rd delegated prefix may vary
   between each block. In this case, different 6rd prefixes, and hence
   separate 6rd domains, may be used to support the different
   encodings. 
</p>
<p>Since 6rd delegated prefixes are selected algorithmically from
   an IPv4 address, changing the IPv4 address will cause a change in
   the IPv6 delegated prefix which would ripple through the site's
   network and could be disruptive. As such, it is recommended that
   the Service Provider assign CE IPv4 addresses with relatively long
   lifetimes.
</p>
<p>6rd IPv6 address assignment and hence the IPv6 service itself is
   tied to the IPv4 address lease, thus the 6rd service is also tied
   to this in terms of authorization, accounting, etc. For example,
   the 6rd delegated prefix has the same lifetime as its associated
   IPv4 address. The prefix lifetimes advertised in Router
   Advertisements or used by DHCP on the CE LAN side MUST be equal to
   or shorter than the IPv4 address lease time. If the IPv4 lease time
   is not known, the lifetime of the 6rd delegated prefix SHOULD
   follow the defaults specified in <a class='info' href='#RFC4861'>[RFC4861]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T., Nordmark, E., Simpson, W., and H. Soliman, &ldquo;Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Troubleshooting and Traceability</h3>

<p>A 6rd IPv6 address and associated IPv4 address for a given
   customer can always be determined algorithmically by the service
   provider that operates the given 6rd domain. This may be useful for
   referencing logs and other data at a service provider which may
   have more robust operational tools for IPv4 than IPv6. This also
   allows IPv4 data path, node, and endpoint monitoring to be
   applicable to IPv6.

<p>The 6rd CE and BR SHOULD support the IPv6 Subnet-Router anycast

   prefix. This allows, for example, IPv6 ICMP echo messages to be
   sent to the 6rd virtual interface itself for additional
   troubleshooting of the internal operation of 6rd at a given CE or
   BR. In the case of the BR, the IPv4 address used to calculate
   the 6rd delegated prefix is the configured BR IPv4 Address.

Customer Edge Configuration</h3>

<p>The four 6rd elements are set to values which are the same
     across all CEs within a 6rd domain. The values may be configured
     in a variety of manners, including automatic provisioning methods
     such as the Broadband Forum's "TR-69" Residential Gateway
     management interface, an XML-based object retrieved after IPv4
     connectivity is established, a DNS record, an SNMP MIB, PPP IPCP,
     or manual configuration by an end-user or operator. This document
     describes how to configure the necessary parameters via a single
     DHCP option. In order to guarantee interoperability, a CE SHOULD
     implement this DHCP option. For consistency and convenience, this
     option format may be used by other automatic configuration
     methods by normative reference to this document.
</p>
<p> The only remaining provisioning information the CE requires
     in order to calculate the 6rd delegated prefix and enable IPv6
     connectivity is an IPv4 address for the CE. This CE IPv4 address
     is configured as part of obtaining IPv4 Internet access (i.e.,
     configured via DHCP, PPP, or otherwise). This address may be
     global or private <a class='info' href='#RFC1918'>[RFC1918]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rekhter, Y., Moskowitz, R., Karrenberg, D., Groot, G., and E. Lear, &ldquo;Address Allocation for Private Internets,&rdquo; February&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> within the 6rd

</p>
<p> A single 6rd CE MAY be connected to more than one 6rd domain,
     just as any router may have more than one IPv6-enabled service
     provider facing interface and more than one set of associated
     delegated prefixes assigned by DHCPv6 PD or other means. Each
     domain a given CE operates within would require its own set of

<p>The presence of the OPTION_6RD DHCP option is an

Neighbor Unreachability Detection</h3>

<p>Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) for tunnels is described
   in Section 3.8 of <a class='info' href='#RFC4213'>[RFC4213]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nordmark, E. and R. Gilligan, &ldquo;Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.  In 6rd, all CEs
   and BRs can be considered as connected to the same virtual link and
   therefore neighbors to each other. This section describes how to
   utilize neighbor unreachability detection without negatively
   impacting the scalability of a 6rd deployment.
</p>
<p>A typical 6rd deployment may consist of a very large number of
   CEs within the same domain. Reachability between CEs is based on
   IPv4 routing, and sending NUD or any periodic packets between 6rd
   CE devices beyond isolated troubleshooting of the 6rd mechanism is
   not recommended. 
</p>
<p>While reachability detection between a given 6rd CE and BR is
   not necessary for the proper operation of 6rd, in cases where a CE
   has alternate paths for BR reachability to choose from, it could be
   useful. Sending NUD messages to a BR, in particular periodic
   messages from a very large number of CEs, could result in
   overloading of the BR control message processing path, negatively
   affecting scalability of the 6rd deployment. Instead, a CE that
   needs to determine BR reachability MUST utilize a method which
   allows reachability detection packets to follow a typical data
   forwarding path without special processing by the BR. One such
   method is described below.
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The CE constructs a payload of any size and content to be sent
     to the BR (e.g., a zero length null payload, a padded payload
     designed to test a certain MTU, a NUD message, etc.). The exact
     format of the message payload is not important as the BR will not
     be processing it directly.
</li>
<li>The desired payload is encapsulated with the inner IPv6 and
     outer IPv4 headers as follows:

     
<ul class="text">
<li>The IPv6 destination address is set to an address from the
       CE's 6rd delegated prefix for which the CE itself will process
       (e.g., a CE "loopback" or other type of local interface
       address).
</li>
<li>The IPv6 source address is set to an address from the CE's
       6rd delegated prefix as well, including the same as used for
       the IPv6 destination address.
</li>
<li>The IPv4 header is then added as it normally would for any
       packet destined for the BR. That is, the IPv4 destination
       address is that of the BR, and source address is the CE IPv4
       address.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The CE sends the constructed packet out the proper
     interface it is monitoring BR reachability on. On successful
     receipt at the BR, the BR MUST decapsulate and forward the packet
     normally. This is, the IPv4 header is decapsulated normally,
     revealing the IPv6 destination as the CE, which in turn results
     in the packet being forwarded to that CE via the 6rd mechanism
     (i.e., the IPv4 destination is that of the CE that originated the
     packet, and the IPv4 source is that of the BR).
</li>
<li>Arrival of the constructed IPv6 packet at the CE's IPv6
     address completes one round trip to and from the BR, without
     causing the BR to process the message outside of its normal data
     forwarding path. The CE then processes the IPv6 packet
     accordingly (updating keepalive timers, metrics, etc).
</li>
</ol>

<p>The payload may be empty, or could contain values that are
   meaningful to the CE. Sending a proper NUD message could be
   convenient for some implementations (note that the BR will
   decrement the IPv6 hop-limit). Since the BR forwards the packet as
   any other data packet without any processing of the payload itself,
   the format of the payload is left as a choice to the
   implementer.

Maximum Transmission Unit</h3>

<p>MTU and fragmentation issues for IPv6 in IPv4 tunneling are
       discussed in detail in section 3.2 of <a class='info' href='#RFC4213'>RFC4213<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nordmark, E. and R. Gilligan, &ldquo;Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4213]. 6rd's scope is limited to a service provider
       network. IPv4 Path MTU discovery MAY be used to adjust the MTU of the
       tunnel as described in section 3.2.2 of <a class='info' href='#RFC4213'>RFC4213<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nordmark, E. and R. Gilligan, &ldquo;Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4213] or the 6rd Tunnel MTU may be explicitly
       configured.
</p>
<p>The use of an anycast source address may lead to any ICMP
       error message generated on the path being sent to a different
       BR. Therefore using dynamic tunnel MTU [section 3.2.2, RFC4213]
       is subject to IPv4 Path MTU blackholes.
</p>
<p>Multiple BRs using the same anycast source address may send
       fragmented packets to the same IPv6 CE at the same time. If the
       fragmented packets from different BRs happen to use the same
       fragment ID, incorrect reassembly may occur. For this reason a
       BR using an anycast source address MUST set the IPv4 Don't
       Fragment flag.
</p>
<p>If the MTU is well-managed such that the IPv4 MTU on the CE
       WAN side interface is set so that no fragmentation occurs
       within the boundary of the SP, then the 6rd Tunnel MTU should
       be set to the known IPv4 MTU minus the size of the
       encapsulating IPv4 header (20 bytes). For example, if the IPv4
       MTU is known to be 1500 bytes, the 6rd Tunnel MTU may be set to
       1480 bytes. Absent of more specific information the 6rd Tunnel
       MTU SHOULD default to 1280 bytes.

Receiving Rules</h3>

<p>In order to prevent spoofing of IPv6 addresses, the 6rd BR and
     CE MUST validate the source address of the encapsulated IPv6
     packet with the IPv4 source address it is encapsulated by
     according to the configured parameters of the 6rd domain. If the
     two source addresses do not match, the packet MUST be dropped and
     a counter incremented to indicate that a potential spoofing
     attack may be underway. Additionally, a CE MUST allow packets
     sourced by the configured BR IPv4 Address.
</p>
<p>The CE router SHOULD drop packets received on the 6rd virtual
     interface (i.e., after decapsulation of IPv4) for IPv6 destinations
     not within its own 6rd delegated prefix.

<a name="rfc.section.10"></a><h3>10.&nbsp;
Transition Considerations</h3>

<p>An SP network may migrate to IPv6 at its own pace with little or
   no effect on customers being provided IPv6 via 6rd. In the event
   native IPv6 connectivity is also available, the CE MAY disable
   6rd.
</p>
<p>The SP can choose to provision a separate IPv6 address block for
   native service, or reuse the 6rd prefix block itself. If the SP
   uses a separate address block, moving from 6rd to native IPv6 is
   seen as a normal IPv6 renumbering event for the
   customer. Renumbering may also be avoided by injecting the 6rd
   delegated prefix into the SP's IPv6 routing domain. Further
   considerations with regards to transitioning from 6rd to native
   IPv6 are not covered in this protocol specification.

<a name="rfc.section.11"></a><h3>11.&nbsp;
IPv6 Address Space Usage</h3>

<p>As 6rd uses service provider address space, 6rd uses the normal
   address delegation a service provider gets from its RIR and no
   global allocation of a single 6rd IANA assigned address block like
   the 6to4 2002::/16 is needed.
</p>
<p>The service provider's prefix must be short enough to encode the
   unique bits of all IPv4 addresses within a given 6rd domain and
   still provide enough IPv6 address space to the residential
   site. Assuming a worst case scenario using the full 32 bits for the
   IPv4 address, assigning a /56 for customer sites would mean that
   each service provider using 6rd would require a /24 for 6rd in
   addition to other IPv6 addressing needs. Assuming that 6rd would be
   stunningly successful and taken up by almost all AS number holders
   (32K today) then the total address usage of 6rd would be equivalent
   to a /9. If the SP instead delegated /60s to sites the service
   provider would require a /28 and the total global address
   consumption by 6rd would be equivalent to a /13. Again, this
   assumes that 6rd is used by all AS number holders in the IPv4
   Internet today at the same time, none used any of 6rd's address
   compression techniques, and that none have moved to native IPv6 and
   reclaimed the 6rd space which was being used for other
   purposes.
</p>
<p>To alleviate concerns about address usage, 6rd allows for
   leaving out redundant IPv4 prefix bits in the encoding of the IPv4
   address inside the 6rd IPv6 address. This is most useful where the
   IPv4 address space is very well aggregated. For example to provide
   each customer with a /60, if a service provider has all its IPv4
   customers under a /12 then only 20 bits needs to be used to encode
   the IPv4 address and the service provider would only need a /40
   IPv6 allocation for 6rd. If private address space is used then a
   10/8 would require a /36. If multiple 10/8 domains are used then up
   to 16 could be supported within a /32.
</p>
<p>If a Service Provider has an non-aggregatable IPv4 space and
   requiring the use of the full 32 bit IPv4 address in the encoding
   of the 6rd IPv6 address, the 6rd prefix MUST be no longer than /32
   in order to offer a 6rd delegated prefix of at least /64.
</p>
<p>The 6rd address block can be reclaimed when all users of it have
   transitioned to native IPv6 service. This may require renumbering
   of customer sites and use of additional address space during the
   transition period.

<a name="rfc.section.12"></a><h3>12.&nbsp;
Security Considerations</h3>

<p>A 6to4 relay router as specified in <a class='info' href='#RFC3056'>[RFC3056]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Carpenter, B. and K. Moore, &ldquo;Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> can be used as an open relay. It can be
   used to relay IPv6 traffic and as a traffic anonymizer. By
   restricting the 6rd domain to within a provider network a CE only
   needs to accept packets from a single or small set of known 6rd BR
   IPv4 Addresses. As such, many of the threats against 6to4 as
   described in <a class='info' href='#RFC3964'>[RFC3964]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Savola, P. and C. Patel, &ldquo;Security Considerations for 6to4,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> do not
   apply.
</p>
<p>When applying the receiving rules in <a class='info' href='#receiving_rules'>Section&nbsp;9.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Receiving Rules</span><span>)</span></a>, IPv6 packets are as well
   protected against spoofing as IPv4 packets are within an SP
   network.
</p>
<p>A malicious user that is aware of a 6rd domain and the BR IPv4
   address could use this information to construct a packet that would
   cause a Border Relay to reflect tunneled packets outside of the
   domain that it is serving. If the attacker constructs the packet
   accordingly, and can inject a packet with an IPv6 source address
   that looks as if it originates from within another 6rd domain,
   forwarding loops between 6rd domains may be created, allowing the
   malicious user to launch a packet amplification attack between 6rd
   domains <a class='info' href='#RoutingLoop'>[RoutingLoop]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nakibly and Arov, &ldquo;Routing Loop Attacks using IPv6 Tunnels,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>One possible mitigation for this is to simply not allow the BR IPv4
   address to be reachable from outside the SP's 6rd domain. In this case,
   carefully constructed IPv6 packets still may be reflected off a single BR,
   but the looping condition will not occur. Tunnelled packets with the BR
   IPv4 address as the source address may also be filtered to prohibit 6rd
   tunnels from exiting the 6rd domain.
</p>
<p>To avoid forwarding loops via other internal relays, the BR
   should employ outgoing and incoming IPv4 packets filters, filtering
   out all known relay addresses for internal 6rd BRs, ISATAP routers
   or 6to4 relays, including the well known anycast address space for
   6to4. Alternatively the following may be implemented according to
   <a class='info' href='#I-D.nakibly-v6ops-tunnel-loops'>[I&#8209;D.nakibly&#8209;v6ops&#8209;tunnel&#8209;loops]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nakibly, G., &ldquo;Routing Loops using ISATAP and 6to4: Problem Statement and Proposed Solutions,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>When the BR forwards an IPv6 packet out the 6rd virtual
     interface, it discards the packet if the IPv6 source address is
     not one of the BR's configured IPv6 addresses but embeds one of
     the BR's configured IPv4 addresses.
</li>
<li>When the BR receives an IPv6 packet on the 6rd virtual
     interface, it discards the packet if the IPv6 destination address
     is not one of the BR's configured IPv6 addresses but embeds one
     of the BR's configured IPv4 addresses.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The BR MUST install a sink route for its 6rd delegated prefix
   created based on its BR IPv4 address, with the exception of the
   IPv6 Subnet-Router anycast address.
