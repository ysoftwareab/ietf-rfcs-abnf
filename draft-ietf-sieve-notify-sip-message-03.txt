Internet-Draft       Sieve Notification: SIP MESSAGE           July 2011


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   The Notify extension [RFC5435] to the Sieve mail filtering language
   [RFC5228] is a framework for providing notifications by employing
   URIs that specify the notification mechanism.  This document defines
   how SIP URIs RFC 3261 [RFC3261] are used to generate notifications
   via SIP MESSAGE RFC 3428 [RFC3428].

   [[REVIEW NOTES: Notes are placed below to document Adam Roach's RAI
   review of the -00 version (
   http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/rai/current/msg00345.html ) and
   Ben Campbell's review of the -02 version (
   http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/rai/current/msg00925.html )]]

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document inherits terminology from the Sieve email filtering
   language [RFC5228], the Sieve Notify extension [RFC5435], and RFC
   3261 [RFC3261].


2.  Definition

   The SIP MESSAGE mechanism defined in this document results in the
   sending of a SIP MESSAGE request to notify a recipient about an email
   message.

2.1.  Notify parameter "method"

   The "method" parameter MUST be a URI that conforms to the SIP (or
   SIPS) URI scheme (as specified in RFC 3261 [RFC3261]) and that
   identifies a SIP (or SIPS) recipient of the notification.  The URI
   MAY include the resource identifier portion of a SIP address and URI
   parameters.  The URI parameter "method" MUST be included and MUST
   contain the value "MESSAGE".  (Note that future specifications might
   extend this document and define Sieve notifications that use other
   SIP methods.)  The processing application MUST form a request
   according to the rules specified in RFC 3261 [RFC3261].

   [[BEN'S REVIEW, MINOR 1; ** resolved **: I think you've got the right
   idea here, but the terminology is wrong--I.e. the SIP URI _is_ the
   SIP address.  I think what you are after is something more along the



Melnikov, et al.         Expires January 9, 2012                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       Sieve Notification: SIP MESSAGE           July 2011


   lines of forming a SIP Request based on an "external" URI, similarly
   to what you might do with a URI in a hypertext link or on a business
   card.  I suggest merely saying something along the lines of "form a
   SIP request according to the rules in rfc 3261"]]

2.1.1.  Notify parameter "method" RAI review notes

   [[RAI REVIEW NOTES: This section and its subsections are included for
   editing purposes, and will be removed before the document is final,
   when the issues are resolved.]]

2.1.1.1.  RAI review notes from Adam Roach

   [[ADAM'S REVIEW 1: These are the notes on section 2.1 from Adam
   Roach's review of 9 Jan 2009.]]

   My first area of concern is that, while this seems a reasonable way
   to perform this functionality in SIP, I don't think it's the only
   reasonable way to do it in SIP.  Consequently, this document needs to
   take care not to preclude future SIP mechanisms for SIEVE
   notifications.  For example, the conveyance of more semantic
   information in a PUBLISH message would be quite useful when there is
   a dynamically changing community of parties interested in receiving
   notifications.  (The PUBLISH would be sent to an event agent, which
   could then receive SUBSCRIBE requests from interested parties).  This
   may be applicable, for example, when monitoring shared resources,
   such as technical support email queues.

   However, the draft makes an implicit assumption that any SIEVE
   notification method URI starting with "sip:" necessarily will make
   use of the mechanism it defines, and never any other.  There is no
   means for disambiguating among multiple mechanisms.  In fact, the
   draft seems to go out of its way to ruin an extensibility mechanism
   that it would have automatically inherited from SIP: "The URI
   parameter 'method' MUST be ignored, because only the MESSAGE method
   is allowed by this specification."

   I would suggest that the draft be amended to either *require* a
   "method" URI parameter (with "MESSAGE" indicating the mechanism
   described in this document), or to include additional information in
   the ":options" tag that explicitly indicates the use of this
   document's mechanism.

2.1.1.2.  RAI review notes from Ben Campbell

   [[BEN'S REVIEW, MAJOR 1a: These are the notes on section 2.1 from Ben
   Campbell's review of 1 Sep 2010.]]

Internet-Draft       Sieve Notification: SIP MESSAGE           July 2011


   You limit the method parameter to SIP or SIPS URIs.  I can imagine
   several reasons you might have done this, most likely to cut down on
   the number of URIs that could would indicate the SIEVE rule was for
   SIP.  But there are other perfectly legitimate URI types for SIP
   MESSAGE requests.  For example TEL URIs are fairly common.  IM URIs
   are also legal for SIP MESSAGE, although you're not likely to see
   those in the wild--but that could change in the future.  SIP may add
   new legal URI types in the future.

   One way around this would be to have some other part of the notify
   "method" parameter identify the fact that a SIP MESSAGE request is
   intended, and then allow any URI type that is legal for SIP MESSAGE.

   You also include the SIP URI method=parameter for the sake of
   extensibility.  This would be an issue if you allowed other URI
   types, since the method parameter is not necessarily defined for all
   URI types.  I'm also not sure this gives you the extensibility you
   want--you would not be able to do anything useful with "method=FOO"
   without some additional SIEVE spec on how to send SIP FOO requests.
   I think you would be better off leaving off the method URI parameter,
   and instead encode something in the :options parameter.

   [Note: I assume you added the method parameter based on feedback from
   Adam from a while back.  I note that he suggested using either the
   method parameter, or something in :options.  I am not disagreeing
   with him--I'm just suggesting that the :options approach is the
   better choice.]

2.1.1.3.  Editor responses to RAI reviews

   [[EDITOR NOTES TO RAI REVIEWS: These are the editor's responses, to
   note work that still needs to be done.]]

   Both of these reviews bring up the same issue: we painted ourselves
   into a corner when we designed the Sieve Notify framework [RFC5435]
   in the first place, by making the "method" parameter a URI, and
   having the URI be the only way to distinguish the notification
   method.  That means that the Sieve engine needs to be able to take a
   URI and know how to process it, and it also means that there's no way
   to use the same URI for different notification methods, depending
   upon the situation.

   One problem with that is that we can't use "mailto:joe@example.org"
   for any notification mechanism other than email, even if some other
   notification mechanism keys off of an email address, and that if we
   use a "tel:" URI for SIP, we can't use "tel:" URIs for anything else.

   Another problem is that we have to know, in advance, all the URI

   schemas that apply to a given notification method.

   I don't know how to resolve these issues within the Sieve Notify
   framework.  (Barry)

2.2.  Notify tag ":from"

   The value of the ":from" tag MUST use the SIP "From" header field
   syntax; if the :from value is specified, has valid syntax, and is
   valid according to the implementation-specific security checks (see
   Section 3.3 of Sieve Notify [RFC5435]), then the notification SHOULD
   include the "From" SIP header field containing the value of the :from
   notify tag.  If the specified value is not valid, then it is ignored.

   All SIP authentication, including challenges and client certificates,
   SHOULD be done in the context of the Sieve engine -- the Sieve engine
   is the identity being authenticated.  This avoids security issues
   associated with the Sieve engine's having access to the end user's
   SIP authentication credentials.  The Sieve engine MAY use server-wide
   credentials (including applicable certificates) that are the same for
   all scripts.  Alternatively, it MAY, for auditing purposes, use
   different sets of Sieve-engine credentials when operating on behalf
   of different users.

   See section 22 of RFC 3261 [RFC3261] for more information about SIP
   authentication.

   [[ADAM'S REVIEW 2; ** resolved **: My second area of concern is with
   the handling of the "From" header field.  The draft-ietf-sieve-notify
   document clearly intends the ":from" value to indicate the value that
   is typically rendered to the contacted party as the source of the
   message.  This intended behavior is upheld by the language in section
   2.3 of draft-ietf-sieve-notify-mailto-10 (it places this value in the
   SMTP "From:" header, and even suggests using the value in the "RCPT
   FROM" command -- despite the easy availability of an SMTP "Reply-To:"
   header).  This mismatch in semantics between the protocols causes me
   concern, as it may surprise users to have radically different
   treatment of the value in the ":from" tag among protocols.  Given the
   text in the base sieve-notify document, I believe that the behavior
   in sieve-notify-mailto is correct, and that the behavior in sieve-
   notify-sip should be modified to align with it.  (Indication of the
   sending server can be made via other means, such as the SIP Call-
   Info: header field).]]

   [[BEN'S REVIEW, MAJOR 2a; ** resolved **: You need to consider how
   the SIEVE implementation deals with SIP authentication, digest
   challenges, etc.  For example, if the peer SIP device responds with a
   401 or 407 containing a digest-challenge, what credentials should be

   used to respond to the challenge?  Would you suggest the credentials
   of a particular user?  If so, are their security considerations
   around having the SIEVE implementation know the credentials of a
   particular user?  Or should the SIEVE implementation authenticate
   with server-wide credentials?]]

   [[BEN'S REVIEW, MAJOR 2b; ** resolved **: Do you allow TLS mutual
   authentication?  If so, what client certificate should be
   presented?]]

2.3.  Notify tag ":options"

   Handling of the ":options" tag is implementation specific.  This
   document doesn't require presence of any option and doesn't define
   how options are processed.

2.4.  Notify tag ":importance"

   The ":importance" tag is intended to convey the importance of the SIP
   MESSAGE notification, not the importance of the email message that
   generated the notification.  The value of the ":importance" tag MAY,
   therefore, be transformed into SIP "Priority" header field (in
   addition to or instead of including it in the body of the message).
   If this is done, the value of the "Priority" header field MUST be
   "urgent" if the value of the ":importance" tag is "1", "normal" if
   the value of the ":importance" tag is "2", and "non-urgent" if the
   value of the ":importance" tag is "3".

   [[BEN'S REVIEW, MINOR 2; ** resolved **: Do you expect the
   :importance tag to set the importance of the SIP MESSAGE request, or
   to convey the importance of the email that generated the notification
   in the first place?  If the first, then you're doing it right.  If
   the second, it might be more reasonable to put something in the
   body.]]

2.5.  Notify tag ":message"

   If the ":message" tag is included, it MUST be transformed into the
   message-body of a SIP MESSAGE, which MUST have Content-Type value of
   "text/plain" with CHARSET="UTF-8".  If the ":message" tag is not
   included, a default message will be used.  The default message body
   SHOULD contain the values of the "From" and "Subject" header fields
   of the triggering email message (and MAY include the value of the
   ":importance" tag, if one is specified), as shown in Section 3.2
   below.

   Implementations MUST comply with the SIP MESSAGE size limits, as
   discussed in section 8 of RFC 3428 [RFC3428].

Internet-Draft       Sieve Notification: SIP MESSAGE           July 2011


   [[BEN'S REVIEW, MINOR 3; ** resolved **: This section needs to
   mention the SIP MESSAGE request size limits from RFC 3428.  Is the
   body still expected to have a content-type of text/plain if no
   :message tag is present?]]

2.6.  Other Definitions

   An implementation MUST ignore any URI parameter it does not
   understand (the URI MUST be processed as if the parameter were not
   present).  Implementations SHOULD NOT use the hname "body" parameter
   value as the message-body of the SIP MESSAGE request.  If the hname
   "body" parameter and ":message" tag are present at the same time, the
   "body" parameter MUST be ignored.

   If the notification request fails, there will be a SIP error code
   describing the failure.  The policy for retrying delivery of failed
   notifications is specified in RFC 3261 [RFC3261], according to the
   error code.  In other words, unlike the situation with some other
   Sieve notification methods, retries for SIP MESSAGE notifications are
   controlled by the notification protocol itself (SIP).

   [[BEN'S REVIEW, MAJOR 3; ** resolved **: I'm not sure what you have
   in mind here.  If you are talking about request retransmission as
   described in 3261, those are not suggestions--they are mandatory
   parts of the SIP state machine.  If you mean something like "try
   again later because the destination party is offline" SIP doesn't
   have much to say about that except in a few specific response
   scenarios.]]

2.7.  Test notify_method_capability

   Because it is impossible to tell in advance whether the notification
   recipient is online and able to receive a SIP MESSAGE, the
   notify_method_capability test for "online" will always return "maybe"
   for this notification method.

   [[BEN'S REVIEW, MINOR 4; ** resolved **: How could you ever know
   this, short of trying the message?  The implementation would have to
   be presence aware to ever return something other than "maybe", and
   even then it can't be certain.]]


3.  Examples

   In the following examples, the sender of the email has an address of
   juliet@example.org, the entity to be notified has a SIP address of
   <sip:romeo@example.com>, and the notification service has a SIP
   address <sip:notifier@example.com>.

3.1.  Example 1

   The following is a basic Sieve notify action with only a method:

   notify "sip:romeo@example.com;method=MESSAGE"

   The resulting SIP MESSAGE request might be as follows:

      MESSAGE sip:romeo@example.com SIP/2.0
      Via: SIP/2.0/TCP notifier.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK776sgdkse
      Max-Forwards: 70
      From: sip:notifier@example.com;tag=32328
      To: sip:romeo@example.com

      Date: Sat, 13 Nov 2010 23:29:00 GMT
      Content-Type: text/plain
      Content-Length: 53

      <juliet@example.com> wrote: Contact me immediately!

   In the example above the email message was received from
   juliet@example.com and had "Subject: Contact me immediately!"

3.2.  Example 2

   The following is a more advanced Sieve notify action with a method,
   importance, subject, and message:

      notify :importance "1"
          :message "You got new mail!"
          "sip:romeo@example.com;method=MESSAGE?subject=SIEVE"

4.  Requirements Conformance Checklist

   Section 3.8 of Sieve Notify [RFC5435] specifies a set of requirements
   for Sieve notification methods.  A checklist is provided here to show
   conformance of the SIP MESSAGE notification method.

   1.   No new Sieve tags have been added to the "notify" action.

   2.   An implementation of the SIP MESSAGE notification method SHOULD
        NOT modify the final notification text, except to comply with
        SIP MESSAGE length limits.  Deployments MAY make operational
        decisions about notification text, for reasons such as privacy
        and confidentiality.  Modification of characters themselves
        should not be necessary, since the SIP MESSAGE body is encoded
        in UTF-8 [RFC3629].

        [[BEN'S REVIEW, MINOR 5; ** resolved **: There are length limits
        for SIP MESSAGE requests that this draft should consider.  They
        are large enough to be generally non constraining for this
        usage, but they exist.]]

   3.   An implementation MAY ignore parameters specified in the
        ":importance", and ":options" tags.

   4.   A default message is suggested in Section 2.5.

   5.   A notification sent via the SIP MESSAGE notification method MAY
        include the Date header field containing the date-time of the
        moment when the SIP MESSAGE notification was generated.

   6.   The notification source is identified through the SIP "From:"
        header field, via the Sieve Notify ":from" tag (see Section 2.2.

   7.   An implementation MUST NOT include any other extraneous
        information not specified in parameters to the notify action.

   8.   An implementation MUST ignore any URI parameters it does not
        understand (i.e., the URI MUST be processed as if the action or
        parameter were not present).  See Section 2.6 for more details.

   9.   The notify_method_capability test for the "online" notification-
        capability behaves as described in Section 2.7.

   10.  The policy for retrying delivery of failed notifications is
        specified in RFC 3261 [RFC3261], as noted in Section 2.6.

5.  Security Considerations

   Depending on the information included, sending a notification can be
   comparable to forwarding mail to the notification recipient.  Care
   must be taken when forwarding mail automatically, to ensure that
   confidential information is not sent into an insecure environment or
   over an insecure channel.

   User agents that support the SIP MESSAGE request MUST implement end-
   to-end authentication, body integrity, and body confidentiality
   mechanisms.

   The Sieve Notify extension specifies that notification methods MUST
   provide mechanisms for avoiding notification loops.  In this case,
   the SIP protocol itself prevents loops, and no explicit work is
   needed within the notification mechanism.  In situations where a SIP
   MESSAGE notification can result in an email message, which could
   generate another SIP MESSAGE notification, loop prevention through
   rate limiting might be necessary.

   Other security considerations given in the Sieve base specification
   [RFC5228], the Sieve Notify extension [RFC5435], and RFC 3261
   [RFC3261] are also relevant to this document.
