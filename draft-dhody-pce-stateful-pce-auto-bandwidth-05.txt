  PCEP Extensions for MPLS-TE LSP Automatic Bandwidth Adjustment with
                              Stateful PCE
             draft-dhody-pce-stateful-pce-auto-bandwidth-05

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
   The stateful PCE extensions provide stateful control of Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched
   Paths (TE LSPs) via PCEP, for the case where PCC delegates control
   over one or more locally configured LSPs to the PCE.

   This document describes automatic bandwidth adjustment of such LSPs
   when employing an Active Stateful PCE.  In one of the models
   described, PCC computes the bandwidth to be adjusted and informs the
   PCE whereas in the second model, PCC reports the real-time traffic to
   a PCE and the PCE computes the adjustment bandwidth.

   This document also describes automatic bandwidth adjustment for
   stateful PCE-initiated LSPs.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) as a
   communication mechanism between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a
   Path Control Element (PCE), or between PCE and PCE, that enables
   computation of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs).

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] specifies extensions to PCEP to enable
   stateful control of MPLS TE LSPs.  It describes two mode of
   operations - Passive Stateful PCE and Active Stateful PCE.  In this
   document, the focus is on Active Stateful PCE where LSPs are
   configured at the PCC and control over them is delegated to the PCE.
   Further [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] describes the setup,
   maintenance and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE
   model.

   Over time, based on the varying traffic pattern, an LSP established
   with certain bandwidth may require to adjust the bandwidth, reserved
   in the network automatically.  Ingress Label Switch Router (LSR)
   collects the traffic rate at each sample interval to determine the
   bandwidth demand of the LSP.  This bandwidth information is then used
   to adjust the LSP bandwidth periodically.  This feature is commonly
   referred to as Auto-Bandwidth.

   Enabling Auto-Bandwidth feature on an LSP results in the LSP
   automatically adjusting its bandwidth based on the actual traffic
   flowing through the LSP.  An LSP set-up with some arbitrary

   (including zero) bandwidth value, automatically monitors the traffic
   flow and adjusts its bandwidth every adjustment-interval period.  The
   bandwidth adjustment uses the make-before-break signaling method so
   that there is no interruption to traffic flow.  This is described in
   detail in Section 4.1.  [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-app] describes the
   use-case for Auto-Bandwidth adjustment for passive and active
   stateful PCE.

   In this document, following deployment models are considered for
   employing Auto-Bandwidth feature with active stateful PCE.

   o  Deployment model 1: PCC to decide adjusted bandwidth:

      *  In this model, the PCC (head-end of the LSP) monitors and
         calculates the new adjusted bandwidth.  The PCC reports the
         calculated bandwidth to be adjusted to the PCE.

      *  This approach would be similar to passive stateful PCE model,
         while the passive stateful PCE uses path request/reply
         mechanism, the active stateful PCE uses report/update mechanism
         to adjust the LSP bandwidth.

      *  For PCE-initiated LSP, the PCC is requested during the LSP
         initiation to monitor and calculate the new adjusted bandwidth.

   o  Deployment model 2: PCE to decide adjusted bandwidth:

      *  In this model, the PCE calculates the new adjusted bandwidth
         for the LSP.

      *  Active stateful PCE can use information such as historical
         trending data, application-specific information about expected
         demands and central policy information along with real-time
         actual flow volumes to make smarter bandwidth adjustment to the
         delegated LSPs.  Since the LSP has delegated control to the
         PCE, it is inherently suited that it should be the stateful PCE
         that decides the bandwidth adjustments.

      *  For PCE-initiated LSP, the PCC is requested during initiation,
         to monitor and report the real-time bandwidth usage.

      *  This model does not exclude use of any other mechanism employed
         by stateful PCE to learn real-time traffic information.  But at
         the same time, using the same protocol (PCEP in this case) for
         updating and reporting the adjustment parameters as well as to
         learn real-time bandwidth usage is operationally beneficial.

   This document defines extensions needed to support Auto-Bandwidth
   feature on the LSPs in a active stateful PCE model using PCEP.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   Active Stateful PCE:  PCE that uses tunnel state information learned
      from PCCs to optimize path computations.  Additionally, it
      actively updates tunnel parameters in those PCCs that delegated
      control over their tunnels to the PCE.

   Delegation:  An operation to grant a PCE temporary rights to modify a
      subset of tunnel parameters on one or more PCC's tunnels.  Tunnels
      are delegated from a PCC to a PCE.

   PCC:  Path Computation Client.  Any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   TE LSP:  Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path.

   Note the Auto-Bandwidth feature specific terms defined in
   Section 4.1.

3.  Requirements for PCEP Extensions

   There are two deployment models considered in this document for
   automatic bandwidth adjustments in case of active stateful PCE.  In
   the model where PCC decides the adjusted bandwidth, PCC can report
   the new requested bandwidth and an active stateful PCE can update the
   bandwidth for a delegated LSP via existing mechanisms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].  Additional PCEP extensions required are
   summarized in the following table.

                 Table 1: Auto-Bandwidth Deployment Models

   Additional Auto-Bandwidth deployment considerations are summarized
   below:

   o  It is required to identify and inform the PCEP peer, the LSP that
      are enabled with Auto-Bandwidth feature.  Not all LSPs in some
      deployments would like their bandwidth to be dependent on the
      real-time traffic but be constant as set by the operator.

   o  It is also required to identify and inform the PCEP peer the model
      of operation i.e. if PCC decides the adjusted bandwidth, or PCC
      reports the real-time traffic instead and the PCE decides the
      adjusted bandwidth.

      *  Note that PCEP extension for reporting real-time traffic, as
         specified in this document, is one of the ways for a PCE to
         learn this information.  But at the same time a stateful PCE
         may choose to learn this information from other means like
         management, performance tools, which are beyond the scope of
         this document.

   o  Further for the LSP with Auto-Bandwidth feature enabled, an
      operator should be able to specify the adjustment parameters (i.e.
      configuration knobs) to control this feature (e.g.  minimum/
      maximum bandwidth range) and PCEP peer should be informed.

4.  Architectural Overview

4.1.  Auto-Bandwidth Overview

   Auto-Bandwidth feature allows an LSP to automatically and dynamically
   adjust its reserved bandwidth over time, i.e. without network
   operator intervention.  The bandwidth adjustment uses the make-
   before-break signaling method so that there is no interruption to the
   traffic flow.

   The new bandwidth reservation is determined by sampling the actual
   traffic flowing through the LSP.  If the traffic flowing through the
   LSP is lower than the configured or current bandwidth of the LSP, the

   extra bandwidth is being reserved needlessly and being wasted.
   Conversely, if the actual traffic flowing through the LSP is higher
   than the configured or current bandwidth of the LSP, it can
   potentially cause congestion or packet loss in the network.  With
   Auto-Bandwidth feature, the LSP bandwidth can be set to some
   arbitrary value (including zero) during initial setup time, and it
   will be periodically adjusted over time based on the actual bandwidth
   requirement.

   Note the following definitions of the Auto-Bandwidth terms:

   Maximum Average Bandwidth (MaxAvgBw):  The maximum average bandwidth
      represents the current traffic demand during a time interval.
      This is the maximum value of the averaged traffic rate in a given
      adjustment-interval.

   Adjusted Bandwidth:  This is the Auto-Bandwidth computed bandwidth
      that needs to be adjusted for the LSP.

   Sample-Interval:  The periodic time interval at which the traffic
      rate is collected as a sample.

   Bandwidth-Sample (BwSample):  The bandwidth sample collected at every
      sample interval to measure the traffic rate.

   Adjustment-Interval:  The periodic time interval at which the
      bandwidth adjustment should be made using the MaxAvgBw.

   Maximum-Bandwidth:  The maximum bandwidth that can be reserved for
      the LSP.

   Minimum-Bandwidth:  The minimum bandwidth that can be reserved for
      the LSP.

   Adjustment-Threshold:  This value is used to decide when the
      bandwidth should be adjusted.  If the percentage or absolute
      difference between the current MaxAvgBw and the current bandwidth
      reservation is greater than or equal to the threshold value, the
      LSP bandwidth is adjusted to the current bandwidth demand
      (Adjusted Bandwidth) at the adjustment-interval expiry.

   Overflow-Threshold:  This value is used to decide when the bandwidth
      should be adjusted when there is a sudden increase in traffic
      demand.  If the percentage or absolute difference between the
      current MaxAvgBw and the current bandwidth reservation is greater
      than or equal to the threshold value, the overflow-condition is
      set to be met.  The LSP bandwidth is adjusted to the current

      bandwidth demand bypassing the adjustment- interval if the
      overflow-condition is met consecutively for the overflow-counts.

   Underflow-Threshold:  This value is used to decide when the bandwidth
      should be adjusted when there is a sudden decrease in traffic
      demand.  If the percentage or absolute difference between the
      current MaxAvgBw and the current bandwidth reservation is greater
      than or equal to the threshold value, the underflow-condition is
      set to be met.  The LSP bandwidth is adjusted to the current
      bandwidth demand bypassing the adjustment- interval if the
      underflow-condition is met consecutively for the underflow-counts.

   Report-Interval:  This value indicates the periodic interval when the
      collected real-time traffic bandwidth samples (BwSample) should be
      reported to the stateful PCE via the PCRpt message.

   Report-Threshold:  This value is used to decide if the real-time
      traffic bandwidth samples collected should be reported.  Only if
      the percentage or the absolute difference between at least one of
      the bandwidth samples collected and the current bandwidth
      reservation is greater than or equal to the threshold value, the
      bandwidth samples collected during the Report-Interval are
      reported otherwise the bandwidth sample(s) are skipped.

   Report-Flow-Threshold:  This value is used to decide when the real-
      time traffic bandwidth samples should be reported immediately when
      there is a sudden change in traffic demand.  If the percentage or
      absolute difference between the current bandwidth sample and the
      current bandwidth reservation is greater than or equal to the flow
      threshold value, all the bandwidth samples collected so far are
      reported to the PCE immediately.

4.2.  Theory of Operation

   The traffic rate is periodically sampled at each sample-interval
   (which can be configured by the user and the default value as 5
   minutes) by the head-end node of the LSP.  The sampled traffic rates
   are accumulated over the adjustment-interval period (which can be
   configured by the user and the default value as 24 hours).  The PCEP
   peer which is in-charge of calculating the bandwidth to be adjusted,
   will adjust the bandwidth of the LSP to the highest sampled traffic
   rate (MaxAvgBw) amongst the set of bandwidth samples collected over
   the adjustment-interval.

   Note that the highest sampled traffic rate could be higher or lower
   than the current LSP bandwidth.  Only if the difference between the
   current bandwidth demand (MaxAvgBw) and the current bandwidth
   reservation is greater than or equal to the Adjustment-Threshold



Dhody, et al.           Expires December 18, 2015               [Page 9]

   (percentage or absolute value), the LSP bandwidth is adjusted to the
   current bandwidth demand (MaxAvgBw).

   In order to avoid frequent re-signaling, an operator may set a longer
   adjustment-interval value.  However, longer adjustment-interval can
   result in an undesirable effect of masking sudden changes in traffic
   demands of an LSP.  To avoid this, the Auto-Bandwidth feature may
   pre-maturely expire the adjustment-interval and adjust the LSP
   bandwidth to accommodate the sudden bursts of increase in traffic
   demand as an overflow condition or decrease in traffic demand as an
   underflow condition.

   In case of Deployment model 2, the PCC reports the real-time traffic
   information and the PCE decides the adjusted bandwidth.  Multiple
   bandwidth samples are collected every report-interval, and reported
   together to the PCE.  To avoid reporting minor changes in real-time
   traffic, report-threshold is used, to suppress the sending of the
   collected samples during the report-interval.  The collected samples
   are reported if at least one sample crosses the Report-Threshold
   (percentage or absolute value).  In order to accommodate sudden
   changes in the real-time traffic, report flow threshold is employed
   by pre-maturely expiry of the report-interval to report the
   unreported bandwidth samples collected so far.

   All thresholds in this document could be represented in both absolute
   value and percentage, and could be used together.

4.3.  Scaling Considerations

   There are potential scaling concerns for the model where PCC (ingress
   LSR) reports real-time traffic information to the stateful PCE for a
   large number of LSPs.  It is recommended to combine multiple
   bandwidth samples (BwSample) using larger report-interval and report
   them together to the PCE, thus reducing the number of PCRpt messages.
   Further Report-Threshold can be use to skip reporting the bandwidth
   samples for small changes in the bandwidth.

   The processing cost of monitoring a large number of LSPs at the PCC
   and handling bandwidth change requests at PCE should be taken into
   consideration.  Note that, this will be implementation dependent.

5.  Extensions to the PCEP

5.1.  AUTO-BANDWIDTH-ATTRIBUTE TLV

   The AUTO-BANDWIDTH-ATTRIBUTE TLV can be included as an optional TLV
   in the LSPA object (as described in [RFC5440]).  Whenever the LSP
   with Auto-Bandwidth feature enabled is delegated, AUTO-BANDWIDTH-

   ATTRIBUTE TLV is carried in PCRpt message in LSPA object.  The TLV
   provides PCE with the 'configurable knobs' of this feature.  In case
   of PCE-Initiated LSP ([I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp]) with Auto-
   Bandwidth feature enabled, this TLV is included in LSPA object with
   PCInitiate message.

   The format of the AUTO-BANDWIDTH-ATTRIBUTE TLV is shown in the

   The presence of AUTO-BANDWIDTH-ATTRIBUTE TLV in LSPA object means
   that the automatic bandwidth adjustment feature is enabled.  All sub-
   TLVs are optional and any unrecognized sub-TLV MUST be silently
   ignored.  If a sub-TLV of same type appears more than once, only the
   first occurrence is processed and any others MUST be ignored.

   If the sub-TLV are not encoded, the defaults based on the local
   policy are assumed.

5.1.2.  Real-time Traffic Reporting

   The sub-TLVs in this section are encoded to inform the PCEP peer the
   various real-time traffic reporting parameters in the Deployment
   Model 2 (where PCE decides the adjusted bandwidth).  In this model,
   Real-time-Traffic-Report-Interval sub-TLV MUST be included to specify
   the frequency of reporting.

   The report threshold is used to decide if the collected bandwidth
   samples should be reported or skipped.  An implementation MAY include
   both sub-TLVs for the absolute value and the percentage, in which
   case the real-time traffic is reported when either of the report
   threshold conditions are met.

5.2.  BANDWIDTH Object

5.2.1.  Auto-Bandwidth Adjusted Bandwidth

   As per [RFC5440], the BANDWIDTH object is defined with two Object-
   Type values as following:

   o  Requested Bandwidth: BANDWIDTH Object-Type is 1.

   o  Re-optimization Bandwidth: Bandwidth of an existing TE LSP for
      which a re-optimization is requested.  BANDWIDTH Object-Type is 2.

   In the first model, where PCC calculates the adjusted bandwidth, PCC
   only reports the calculated bandwidth to be adjusted (MaxAvgBw) to
   the PCE.  This is done via the existing 'Requested Bandwidth with
   BANDWIDTH Object-Type as 1'.

5.2.2.  Bandwidth-Usage Report

   A new BANDWIDTH object type is defined to report the actual bandwidth
   usage of a TE LSP.

   The Object type is [TBD], the object body has a variable length,
   multiples of 4 bytes.  The payload format is as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                          Bandwidth-Usage format

   o  BwSample: The actual bandwidth usage, (the BwSample collected at
      the end of each sample-interval) encoded in IEEE floating point
      format (see [IEEE.754.1985]), expressed in bytes per second.

   The Bandwidth-Usage object can be used in the second deployment model
   where PCC reports the TE LSP bandwidth usage and the PCE decides the
   auto-bandwidth adjusted bandwidth.

   The Bandwidth-Usage object can also be used for TE LSPs without
   enabling the auto-bandwidth feature, to learn the actual bandwidth

   usage of the LSPs for other applications at the stateful PCE.  The
   details of which are beyond the scope of this document.

5.3.  The PCRpt Message

   When LSP is delegated to a PCE for the very first time, BANDWIDTH
   object of type 1 is used to specify the requested bandwidth in the
   PCRpt message.

   When the LSP is enabled with the Auto-Bandwidth feature, and Real-
   time-Traffic-Report-Interval sub-TLV is not present (Deployment model
   1), PCC SHOULD include the BANDWIDTH object of type 1 to specify the
   calculated bandwidth to be adjusted to the PCE in the PCRpt message.

   When the LSP is enabled with the Auto-Bandwidth feature, and Real-
   time-Traffic-Report-Interval sub-TLV is present (Deployment model 2),
   PCC SHOULD include the BANDWIDTH object of type [TBD] to report the
   real-time traffic to the PCE in the PCRpt message.

   The definition of the PCRpt message (see [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce])
   is unchanged by this document.

5.4.  The PCInitiate Message

   For PCE-initiated LSP [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] with Auto-
   Bandwidth feature enabled, AUTO-BANDWIDTH-ATTRIBUTE TLV MUST be
   included in LSPA object with the PCInitiate message.  The rest of the
   processing remains unchanged.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a new BANDWIDTH type and AUTO-BANDWIDTH-
   ATTRIBUTE TLV which do not add any new security concerns beyond those
   discussed in [RFC5440] and [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] in itself.

   Some deployments may find the reporting of the real-time traffic
   information as extra sensitive and thus should employ suitable PCEP
   security mechanisms like TCP-AO or [I-D.ietf-pce-pceps].

7.  Manageability Considerations

7.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   The Auto-Bandwidth feature MUST BE controlled per tunnel (at Ingress
   (PCC) or PCE), the values for parameters like sample-interval,
   adjustment- interval, minimum-bandwidth, maximum-bandwidth,
   adjustment-threshold, report-interval, report-threshold SHOULD be
   configurable by an operator.
