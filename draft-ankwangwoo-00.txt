Abstract: This memo provides information on the transition of IPV4
	  to IPV6.  This information explains the IPV6's address 
	  packet definition.  The method used is an efficient way to 
	  control all electric goods in a network with one IP 
	  address (telephone number).
	  This type of packet definition will reduce hop count which
	  dramatically improves speed, reliability, connections, and
	  overall performance.

My suggestion about ipv6 packet's address format is

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     10                                                              14
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |              Interface or Serial Number                       |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     14                              16
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |      Plus Upper Half          |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                    
Continental Code	(2bit within first one byte)
Country Code		(6bit within first one byte)
Area Code+phone number	(using next 6byte)
Subnet and Device Code	(using next 3byte)
Interface or Serial No	(using next 6byte)


CC code is continental code
I divided this first byte into 2 bit and 6 bit fields. First the 2 bit 
field represents the continental code and last 6 bit field represents 
each country in the continents.

I assigned   0 for America 
	     1 for Asia (include New Zealand and Australia)
	     2 for Europe
	     3 for Africa
	    second 6 bit for country code
	      0-63
                  


I suggest this 3 byte field for subnet id and device code id.
If subnet id field use 2 byte then 1 byte is for device code field. 
If subnet id field use 1 byte then 2 byte is for device code field.

The reason I put device code id is to manage every electric goods easily 
in the  house; small, medium, or large size companies.
For example, in large networking, there are many routers and I set the 
device code 1 for the router. Then it's easy to manage router one at a 
time.
If there are same robots or TV sets in large factory or within network. 
This device code makes diagnostics, sending and receiving the same signal 
simple.
This field's device code works likes port number in TCP packet. I mean 
globally, popular electric goods can be assigned the same number all over 
the world, such as web service port that is assigned with 80.
TV set can be assigned as 1, cellular phone can be assigned as 2, telephone
can be assigned as 3, Television set can be assigned as 4, etc...

This 6 byte field is known as the interface id.
But there's another problem with this interface id which assigned is 
exhausted rapidly because 2 byte fields are already assigned to companies.
So I suggest the usage of serial number of electrical goods id to identify 
easier by manufacturing companies.
And when manufacturing companies need to access their own electric goods 
for diagnostic purpose, it can be used the product id which tells every 
possible information about the product.

It's merit I suggest is:
1. Same address space assignment to the each country regardless of 
population and usage. It might be unfair, but it's enough, none of the 
countries can reach their own address space, however some countries will 
need more IETF assigned in the future than at this time.
2. The most important thing is to reduce the hop count. This dramatically 
improves speed, consistency, and reliability.
3. Easy to remember because this is telephone number.

(2)
I suggest changing to the new Domain name style.
Today we use 8-9 domain name style (ie: com, edu, org, net, etc...)
When we take a glance at domain names it doesn't tell much information.
And this naming style is convenient to research many different items and 
companies.
Still it is hard to advertise their own domain name to the small and mid 
size company because the cost of advertising is so great.
It's not made for individuals, small business, or mid size business.
My suggestion for new domain name style is using job category and name.
For example,
If there is a flower shop named "pretty", then it's domain name is 
"flower.pretty"
or "pretty.flower."
Nowaday, Internet e-commerce is used by big company and from long distance.
In the future, Internet will be used as e-commerce by small, mid size 
company to provide service or product within local area,
so I believe this kind of name style is ease to use by local area user.

My suggested transition to the ipv6 is


	    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |     DNS       |
	    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	   ^           
          /    /
       1 /  2 /
        /    /
       /    /
           V
 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  ----3----> +-+-+-+-+-+ ----4----> +-+-+-+-+-+-+	
 |   IPV4 Node |             |  Router |            | IPV6 Node |	
 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  <----6---- +-+-+-+-+-+ <---5----- +-+-+-+-+-+-+                                                                                                                                                       


Prerequisite:


Ipv4 DNS server maintain

Domain name    ipv4 address

But in my plan 
DNS server maintain

Domain name	ipv4 address	ipv6 address

Router and proxy server(mainly gateway) requires maintenance mapping with 
ipv4 address to ipv6 (one by one)

Step 1 on diagram
Name query for ipv6 address

Step 2
Send back ipv4 address mapped with ipv6 address 

Step 3
Send packet with ipv4 address

Step 4
Send packet to the ipv6 node with converting to ipv6 address

Step 5 
Send back to the router with ipv6 format

Step 6
Send back to the ipv4 node with converting to the ipv4 format
