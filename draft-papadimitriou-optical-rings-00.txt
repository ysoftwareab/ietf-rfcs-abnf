Abstract

  The scope of this draft is to specify the IP-based signaled
  protection mechanisms for optical rings and hybrid optical mesh-ring
  topologies. With the dynamic ring configuration process, we determine
  the information to be distributed to dynamically emulate optical
  rings on top of a meshed optical network topology. This information
  exchange further enables the specification of Optical Ring Traffic
  Engineering. Within the IP Control-based signaling plane, we also
  specify the mechanisms to provide dynamic and fast-protection
  switching, and distributed LSP route computation on top of ring-based
  and hybrid mesh-rings optical networks.

1. Introduction

  The concept of optical ring emulation is introduced. It applies when
  considering the ring configuration on top of optical mesh topology
  including Optical Cross-Connects (OXC) and not only Optical Add-Drop-
  Multiplexers (O-ADM). Compared to the approach developed in [IPO-
  RHMR], emulated optical rings add configuration flexibility when
  considering optical network protection. The mechanisms developed here
  are quite general and enable the deployment of hybrid mesh-rings
  optical network topologies. It also provides a clear separation
  between the dynamic ring configuration and the dynamic ring resource
  allocation. This allows a greater ring resource management
  flexibility that fits more suitably the bandwidth on demand
  requirements for optical networks.

  The complexity of ring emulation arises when defining several rings
  on top of a mesh topology including Optical Cross-Connects (OXC)
  connected through fiber trunks. This because by configuring several
  optical rings on top of a meshed topology, a ring cover is defined.
  Consequently, the shared protection of some parts of ring û
  specifically the links and the nodes - with other contiguous rings
  implies the definition of specific as described in [OPT-NET] and
  [OPT-RINGS]. The corresponding fast link protection mechanism is
  performed at the node level is completely distributed and autonomous.
  Note that it still requires signalling message exchange in order to
  recover unidirectional link failures.

  The approach developed here combines distributed fast link protection
  mechanism and signalling message exchange between nodes when a
  failure is detected on a link connecting to adjacent nodes belonging
  to the same ring. In order to specify these mechanisms, we first
  describe the optical ring concept currently under development at the
  ITU-T to determine the corresponding mechanism for all-optical rings.

2. Optical Rings - Concepts

2.1 ITU-T Optical Rings

  The aim of this section is neither to describe the pro and cons of
  optical rings with respect to optical mesh network nor to explain in
  detail the well known ITU-T ring technology [ITUT-G841]. Many
  references can be found comparing, the architecture, the protection
  as well as the resource use of both kinds of topologies.

  The objective is to determine the requirements and the functional
  aspects of these ring technologies in order to define the
  corresponding mechanisms for all-optical rings. For that purpose, we
  first describe the ring technology and types of protected rings
  currently defined (by using ITU-T terminology):

  - Optical Channel Dedicated Protection Ring (OCh-DPRing) or O-UPSR
  (Optical Unidirectional Path Switched Ring). Dedicated protection can
  also be provided through Single Optical Channel (1+1) Sub-network
  Connection Protection (OCh-SNCP).

  - Optical Channel Shared Protection Ring (OCh-SPRing) or O-BPSR
  (Optical Bi-directional Path Switched Ring) existing in two flavors:
  2 Fiber O-BPSR (O-BPSR/2) and 4-Fiber O-BPSR (O-BPSR/4) and 2
  switching strategies: ring switch (2- and 4-Fiber) and span switch
  (4-Fiber only).

  - Optical Multiplex-Section Dedicated Protection Ring (OMS-DPRing) or
  O-ULSR (Optical Unidirectional Line Switched Ring)

  - Optical Multiplex-Section Shared Protection Ring (OMS-SPRing) or O-
  BLSR (Optical Bi-directional Line Switched Ring) existing in 2
  flavors: 2 Fiber O-BLSR (O-BLSR/2) and 4-Fiber O-BLSR (O-BLSR/4) and
  2 switching strategies: ring switch and span switch.

  Details about the corresponding SDH ring architectures can be found
  in ITU-T G.841 (for SDH/Sonet networks). The ITU-T is currently
  defining Optical Transport Network (OTN) Ring Architecture by
  extending the G.841 specification.

  These ring types can be treated separately if we differentiate the
  unidirectional (OMS and OCh) Dedicated Protection Rings (DPRing) from
  the bi-directional (OMS and OCh) Shared Protection Rings (SPRing).
  This by taking into account that switched rings are also referred to
  as self-healing rings (SHR) since they protect automatically against
  failures. The main feature of self-healing rings is their ability to
  recover any LSP in case of link (i.e. fiber) failure and part of the
  LSP in case of node failure.

  SHR applied on optical rings are referred to as WDM-SHR. The
  corresponding protection mechanism are briefly described here:

  1. OMS-DPRing (or O-ULSR):
        - Unidirectional OMS protection is achieved by using 1+1 fast
        protection switching at the OMS-layer.
        - One fiber is dedicated as working fiber and the other is
        dedicated as protection fiber. Working and protection fibers
        operate in opposite directions: the working ring operates on
        the clockwise direction on the protection ring on the counter
        clockwise direction. The protection ring carries the same
        signal than the working fiber but in the opposite direction.
        The same mechanism applies if we replace the term fiber by
        wavelength.
        - Since single-ended protection (or unidirectional protection
        switching) is used, OMS-DPRing does not require coordinated O-
        APS signalling at the OMS-layer.

  2. OMS-SPRing (or O-BLSR):
        - OMS switched rings are based on optical automatic protection
        switching (O-APS) protocol through signalling channel by using
        OMS overhead bytes (or equivalent). The O-APS mechanism enables
        coordinated actions at the OMS-layer between nodes when a
        failure occurs.
        - OMS-SPRing performs bulk OCh-layer switching based on OMS-
        level failure indications through OMS-layer O-APS signaling;
        all optical-channels are protected (i.e. switched) as a group
        within the OMS (so incapable of protecting optical channels
        independently of one another based on OCh-layer failure
        indications.
        - Ring switching protection (2-fiber and 4-fiber) is based on
        loopback protection switching and activated when both working
        and protection link failure occurs simultaneously. By using O-
        APS signalling, when a link failure occurs, the working lines
        (wavelength) from the working fiber are looped back onto the
        opposite direction on protection wavelength on the protection
        fiber in the opposite direction. Note that combination of
        working and protection link failure and node failure should
        also be considered.
        - Span switching protection (4-fiber only) is activated when
        only working link failure occurs. When a link failure occurs,
        the working lines (wavelengths) from the working fiber are
        switched to the protection fiber in the same direction. Span
        switching protection is also referred to as non-loopback
        switched protection.
        - In terms of SHR, OMS-SPRings are referred to as Shared Line
        switched WDM-SHR (SLs-WDM-SHR) since they rely on shared line
        switched protection.

  3. OCh-DPRing (or O-UPSR)
        - Unidirectional path switched-protection is achieved by using
        1+1 fast protection switching at the OCh-layer.
        - One fiber is dedicated as working fiber and the other is
        dedicated as protection fiber. Working and protection fibers
        operate in opposite directions: the working ring operates on
        the clockwise direction on the protection ring on the counter
        clockwise direction. The protection ring carries the same
        signal than the working fiber but in the opposite direction so
        that the protection ring fully protects the working ring.
        The mechanism applies if we replace the term fiber by
        wavelength.
        - Since single-ended protection (or unidirectional protection
        switching) is used, OCh-DPRing does not require coordinated O-
        APS OCh-layer signalling. If a working OCh failure occurs, only
        one direction is affected and for that direction OCh switching
        is performed at the far-end. In the other direction, no OCh-
        layer switching is performed.

        - OCh-layer protection is based on optical channel resilient
        schemes by protecting individual path; so this protection
        allows a selective recovery of the OMS between nodes
        - In terms of SHR, OCh-DPRings are referred to as Dedicated
        Path switched WDM-SHR (DPs-WDM-SHR) since they rely on
        dedicated path switched protection.

  4. OCh-SPRing (or O-BPSR)
        - Bi-directional path switched protection requires the need for
        a protection architecture performing OCh switching based on
        independent OCh failure detection.
        - This implies the specification of an O-APS signalling
        protocol at the OCh-layer using the OCh overhead byte.
        - Ring switching protection can also be defined for 2- and 4-
        Fiber OCh-SPRings. Span switching protection can be defined for
        4-Fiber OCh-SPRings.
        - In terms of SHR, OCh-SPRings are referred to as Shared Path
        switched WDM-SHR (SPs-WDM-SHR) since they rely on shared path
        switched protection

  The distinction between Working and Protected path is defined as
  follows:
  - Working path: carrying optical channel defined between the source
  and the destination node
  - Protecting path: non-carrying optical channel defined between the
  source and the destination node transported over the complement of
  the ring

  The distinction between Working and Protected line is defined as
  follows:
  - Working line: carrying OMS defined between the source and an
  intermediate node or between intermediate nodes or between an
  intermediate node and the destination node transported over the
  complement of the ring
  - Protection line: non-carrying OMS defined between the source and an
  intermediate node or between intermediate nodes or between an
  intermediate node and the destination node transported over the
  complement of the ring

  The following table gives the equivalence between the linear (mesh
  networks) and ring protection.

2.3 Transparent and All-Optical Rings

  The previous section detailed the ring technologies and types for
  Optical Transport Networks (i.e. ITU-T G.709 based OTN). The
  objective here is to define the same kind of mechanisms for pure
  optical rings.

  A pure optical ring is defined as a ring including Optical Cross-
  Connects (OXC) and Photonic Cross-Connects (PXC). The difference
  between OXC and PXC is that O/E/O conversion is performed at each of
  its interface while PXCs do not perform O/E/O conversion at all.

  An all-optical ring is defined as ring including only PXC while a
  transparent ring is defined as including at least one OXC. In order
  to be independent of physical layer concerns like distance,
  dispersion, jitter, PMD, BER, etc., only transparent optical rings
  are considered in the remaining parts of this document. We refer to
  these transparent optical rings as optical rings.

  The fundamental problem of optical rings is to which extend the IP
  control-based signaling plane need to be considered for defining ring
  protection mechanism. In the model developed in this memo, we try to
  extract the relevant information needed in order to provide the same
  level of resiliency as the one currently available with SDH/Sonet
  DXC-based rings [ITUT-G841] and the corresponding extension under
  definition for Optical Transport Networks (OTN). This implies the
  definition at IP control-plane level of the required O-APS signalling
  protocol by keeping independence from the current protection
  mechanisms defined for SDH/Sonet rings.

  The information needed to dynamically configure an optical ring on
  top of a mesh optical network topology and the corresponding link
  (and wavelengths) resources management information depends on:
  - the ring identification
  - the ring protection type
  - the ring directionality
  - the ring architecture

  Based on this information, the dynamic ring configuration is
  performed (cf. Section 3). When the optical ring has been configured
  (i.e. emulated on top of the mesh topology), the ring resources
  allocation to the Lambda-switched LSPs (i.e. the optical channels)
  segments or tunnels can be computed for this emulated ring.

  The equivalence between ITU-T rings and the corresponding protection
  mechanism in all-optical networks is summarized in the following
  table:

  --------------------------------------------------------
  ITU-T Rings  |  Corresponding protection mechanism
  --------------------------------------------------------

  OMS-DPRing   |  1+1 dedicated fiber link (or wavelength)
  --------------------------------------------------------
  OMS-SPRing   |  M:N shared fiber link (or wavelength)
  --------------------------------------------------------
  OCh-DPRing   |  1+1 dedicated LSP segment protection
  --------------------------------------------------------
  OCh-SPRing   |  M:N shared LSP segment protection
  --------------------------------------------------------

  The OMS-layer protection (dedicated or shared) concept corresponds to
  the protection of a wavelength bundle transported on a fiber link
  between two adjacent nodes. The OCh-layer protection (dedicated or
  shared) concept corresponds to the protection of LSP segment(s)
  transported on a wavelength switched path (i.e. partial LSP path)
  between the ingress and the egress node of a given ring.

  Knowing each of the SDH/Sonet and OTN ring functional aspects and the
  mapping of the underlying concepts with their counterparts in all-
  optical networks, the corresponding ring protection mechanism can be
  defined.

2.3 Meshed Optical Network Topology

  The basic assumptions concerning the optical network topology are:

  - Mesh (and transparent) optical network including Optical Cross-
  Connect (OXC) connected through fiber trunks as described in [IPO-
  SRLG].

  - OXC interfaces or ports are Lambda-Switch Capable (LSC) interfaces
  as described in [GMPLS-SIG] meaning that any OXC interface includes
  DWDM capabilities. OXC or eventually fiber switch capable (FSC)
  interfaces (but they are considered as a particular outside the main
  scope of this document).

  - Each of these OXCs has its own IP controller that may be or not
  included within the same device. Each controller is uniquely
  identified by its IP Address. The inter-connection of the IP
  controllers defines the IP based control-plane of the optical
  network.

  - Signaling channels between the IP-based controllers of OXCs is
  realized through either dedicated Optical Supervisory Channels (OSC)
  (out-of-band/in-fiber) or through a dedicated out-of-band/out-of-
  fiber network.

  - Signaling protocol is based on Generalized MPLS signaling as
  described in [GMPLS-SIG] in combination with Generalized RSVP-TE
  [GMPLS-RSVPTE] and Generalized CR-LDP [GMPLS-CRLDP] extensions.

  The basic meshed topology of the optical network can be represented
  as a planar graph:

               A ------ B ------ C
               |        |        |
               |        |        |
               |        |        |
               D ------ E ------ F
               |        |        |
               |        |        |
               |        |        |
               G ------ H ------ I

  Each of the nodes (vertex) of this topology is an OXC. Nodes are
  connected through fiber links. This topology (see above figure as
  example) also defines a planar graph [OPT-NET], G(V,E) where V is the
  vertex and E the edge of the planar graph. The considerations
  developed here take into account this representation of the optical
  network topology. The non-planar case is left for further study.

3. Optical Ring Emulation

  Ring emulation concept refers to the configuration of optical rings
  on top of a meshed optical topology including OXCs and not only O-
  ADMs. This approach provides the advantage of ring configuration
  flexibility without having to move or replace the devices already
  included in the optical network.

  The emulation concept provides also more flexibility during the
  (dynamic) configuration of optical ring covers and the resource
  allocation between the different rings included in the cover.

3.1 Optical Ring Covers

  A ring cover is defined as a set of closed paths that covers all
  links in the optical network at least once. So, a (complete) optical
  meshed topology ring cover of the meshed optical topology will be
  achieved when every node can be connected to at least one ring.

  Two types of ring covers can be defined:
  - non-overlapping ring cover: several rings covering (any node, in
  case of complete ring-covers) the optical network are emulated on top
  of a mesh topology; each of these nodes belongs to only one ring
  except boundary nodes; non-overlapping ring covers can be complete
  (covering the whole meshed topology) or incomplete (partially
  covering the meshed topology)
  - overlapping ring cover (or multi-ring cover): several rings
  covering (any node in case of complete ring-covers) are configured on
  top of an optical meshed topology; each of these nodes can be a
  boundary node

  However, in the first release of this document, we only consider non-
  overlapping incomplete or complete ring covers. This choice is
  motivated by the complexity of the multi-ring covers as described in
  [OPT-MWS] and [OPT-RINGS] where double covers of non-planar graphs
  are studied.

  In ring covers, fiber links shared between more than one ring are
  referred to as shared links. However, wavelengths are dynamically
  assigned to one (and defined as dedicated protection wavelengths) or
  more than one ring (and defined as shared protection wavelengths).

  Consequently, the emulation of an optical ring on top of meshed
  optical network topology requires that:
  - the configuration of the OXC optical switching matrix included
  within a ring is designed to provide O-ADM functions (add, drop,
  drop-and-continue, protection switching, etc.)
  - in a shared link, each of the wavelengths belongs (for a given time
  period) to one and only one ring precluding the usage of the
  dynamically assigned wavelengths by the other ring

  In the following mesh topology, a non-overlapping ring cover is
  defined for instance by the following set of rings:

       - Ring 1: A-B-E-D-A
       - Ring 2: B-C-F-E-B
       - Ring 3: E-F-I-H-E
       - Ring 4: D-E-H-G-D

  In this topology:
  - Node C is an internal node since it belongs only to Ring 2
  - Node D is a boundary node since it belongs to Ring 1 and Ring4

               A ------ B ------ C
               |        |        |
               | Ring 1 | Ring 2 |
               |        |        |
               D ------ E ------ F
               |        |        |
               | Ring 4 | Ring 3 |
               |        |        |
               G ------ H ------ I

  Node E has a particular situation in this topology since this
  boundary node belongs to the four rings simultaneously. So, if we
  consider each ring as an abstract node, the same topology can also
  represented as follows

                       B,E
              R1 --------------- R2
              | \               / |
              |  \             /  |

              |   \  E        /   |
           E,D|    =====x=====    |E,F
              |   /        E  \   |
              |  /             \  |
              | /               \ |
              R4 --------------- R3
                       E,H


  As a result, if a node N1 connected to the ring R1 requests an LSP to
  a node N2 connected to ring R3, the shortest ringed path is the one
  going through Node E. This shows clearly that additional information
  is required that takes into account the working (and protection) load
  of the ring. This load information has to be shared between the rings
  and between the rings and the external nodes to the rings.

  In the same topology, an overlapping ring cover is defined by the
  following set of rings:

        - Ring 1: A-B-C-F-E-D-A
        - Ring 2: D-E-F-I-H-G-D
        - Ring 3: E-F-I-H-E

                A ------ B ------ C
               |        |        |
               |      Ring 1     |
               |        |        |
               D ------ E ------ F
               |        |        |
               |      Ring 2     |
               |        | Ring 3 |
               G ------ H ------ I


  As mentioned previously, overlapping ring covers are not considered
  in the first release of this document.

3.2 Dynamic Optical Ring Configuration

  The emulation of a ring on top of optical meshed topology is
  determined by the exchange of the following information between OXC:
  - each ring is defined by a Ring ID (32-bit field)
  - each ring shares a unique Virtual IPv4 Address (32-bit field)
  - a Loopback IPv4 Address (32-bit field) is allocated per node
  belonging to a given ring and per ring contiguous to a given node
  such that neighboring nodes see a given ring as a single abstract
  node identified by its loopback IPv4 address
  - each ring is characterized by a Ring Protection Type (8-bit field)
  which enables to select a given protection-type when establishing a
  LSP over that ring

  - each ring knows the complete list of identifiers describing the
  SRLGs to which a given link belongs.
  - each ring owns an associated Ring Metric used to bootstrap the
  initial ring resource allocation during the ring configuration
  process
  - each ring defines a internal Ring Policy (8-bit field) including
  ring protection strategy, the ring protection scheme, and the
  priority/preemption support

  Consequently, the dynamic ring configuration includes the exchange of
  basic identification information: the Ring Identifier, the Ring
  Protection-Type, the Ring Virtual IP Address, the Ring Metric and the
  Ring Policy.

3.2.1 Ring ID

  Each of the node belonging to a given ring is identified by a node ID
  defined as a Loopback IPv4 Address (in the future we will include
  IPv6 node identification). So that a specific common identifier need
  to exchanged between nodes belonging to the same ring.

  For this purpose, a Ring ID defined as a 32-bit integer field that
  uniquely identifies a given ring within a given optical domain (i.e.
  administrative authority).

  The ring ID is exchanged between neighboring nodes until reaching a
  loop (on top of the meshed topology) constituted by nodes having the
  same Ring ID. The Ring ID verification process at each node is
  straightforward and does not require additional explanations.

3.2.2 Virtual IP Address

  Each node included within a given ring shares a unique virtual IPv4
  Address with other nodes belonging to the same ring. The IPv4 address
  is uniquely defined per optical domain (i.e. administrative
  authority).

  By using a Virtual IPv4 Address to address a ring, a network
  management system can reach any node of a given ring included within
  a complex optical ringed topology without knowing the status of the
  ring node or the corresponding ring topology.

   Example:

  If we refer to the previous optical network topology (see figure), we
  have the following IP reachability between the multi-ring cover:
  - Ring 1 is identified by the Ring ID 1 and Virtual IP Address 1
  - Ring 2 à                    Ring ID 2 and Virtual IP Address 2
  - Ring 3 à                    Ring ID 3 and Virtual IP Address 3
  - Ring 4 à                    Ring ID 4 and Virtual IP Address 4

3.2.3 Loopback IPv4 Address

  In order to avoid the use of interface address and so potentially
  experience disrupted communication between nodes belonging to the
  same, a loopback IPv4 address is allocated per node.

  For each ring contiguous to a given node, an additional loopback IPv4
  address is allocated to this node. A ring can be considered as an
  abstract single node for its neighboring OXC. Consequently, this IP
  address identifies the abstract node constituted by a ring with
  respect to the rings connected to this node.

   From the neighboring rings point-of-view, this loopback IPv4 address
  enables to reach a given node at any time independently of the status
  of its incoming links.

  The loopback IPv4 address is exchanged with the ring contiguous to
  the node owner of this address but also between nodes belonging to
  the same ring. These loopback IPv4 addresses are exchanged between
  neighboring nodes in order to avoid the use of interface address for
  intra-ring communication and duplicated loopback IPv4 address that
  are subsequently distributed to neighboring rings.

  Example:

  From a nodal point of view, the neighbor relationship is determined
  by local loopback IPv4 address to each of the neighboring ring from a
  given node:

  - Node B (belonging to ring 1 and ring 2) has 2 neighboring rings:
        - Ring 1 identified by Loopback IP address B01
        - Ring 2 identified by Loopback IP address B02

  - Node 1 connected has 1 neighboring ring:
        - Ring 1 identified by Loopback IP address A1

  - Node 3 connected has 2 neighboring rings:
        - Ring 1 identified by Loopback IP address D1
        - Ring 2 identified by Loopback IP address D2

  From a ring point of view, the neighbor relationship is determined by
  the local loopback IPv4 address:

  - Ring 1 has 3 neighboring rings:
        - Ring 2 identified by Loopback IP address B21 and E21
        - Ring 3 identified by Loopback IP address E31
        - Ring 4 identified by Loopback IP address D41 and E41

  Consequently, a boundary node belonging to two rings owns two virtual
  IP addresses. In order to pass from one to ring to the other, the

  boundary node performs a shortcut. Imagine that Node 1 connected to
  Ring 1 (through Node A) communicates with the Node 2 connected to
  Ring 3 (through Node I). Then, the explicit route computed and
  selected by Node 1 can be [A1 û E3 û Node 2]. However, the actual
  route followed by the signalling message is [Node 1 - A1 (tunnel1) E3
  (tunnel2) I3 û Node 2] where tunnel1 could.

           Node 1 ------ A ------ B ------ C
                         |        |        |
                          | Ring 1 | Ring 2 |
                          |        |        |
           Node 3 ------ D ------ E ------ F

                         G ------ H ------ I ------ Node 2


3.2.4 Optical Ring Protection Type

  The Optical Ring Protection Type defines the protection technology
  supported by nodes belonging to the same ring.

  The Optical Ring Protection Type (which can be encoded as an 8-bit
  field) is defined as the combination of the following parameters:
  - Ring technology: Optical (= 0) or OTH-based (= 1)
  - Ring protection type: Dedicated (= 0) or Shared (= 1)
  - Ring protection level: Link-level (= 0) or Path-level (= 1)
  - Ring protection fibers: 2-fiber (= 0) or 4-fiber (= 1)
  - Ring switching: ring-switch (= 0) or span-switch (= 1)
  - Other values (3 bits) are reserved for future use

  So for a instance, a OCh-DPRing is defined by a 0xA0 protection type
  and an 4-fiber shared path-level optical ring is defined by a 0x70
  protection type. Since span-switch is only supported with 4-fiber
  rings, one must avoid the 2-fiber and span-switch combination.

  Note the ring technology could also be defined as Transparent (= 0)
  and All-Optical (= 1) when the optical network topology includes only
  OXC or PXC respectively.

3.2.5 Ring Link Diversity - SRLG

  The shared link risk groups (SRLGs) are exchanged between nodes
  belonging to the same ring. This in order to potentially avoid the
  use of a shared resource that can affect all links belonging to this
  group in case of failure of this shared resource. For instance, as
  described in [IPO-SRLG], two LSPs flowing through the same fiber link
  in the same fiber trunk.

Draft-papadimitriou-optical-rings-00.txt                 February 2001


  [IPO-BUNDLE] extends the SRLGs concept by demonstrating that a given
  link could belong to more than one SRLG, and two links belonging to a
  given SRLG may individually belong to two other SRLGs.

3.2.6 Ring Metric

  The ring metric is used to bootstrap the initial ring resource
  allocation during the ring configuration process. This metric is
  exchanged during the initial ring configuration and only considered
  by a node if its ring ID corresponds to the one advertised with the
  ring metric.

  The ring metric is a composed metric including the following
  components: the ring absolute weight, the ring capacity and the ring
  maximum restoration time.

  1. Ring absolute weight

  The ring absolute weight translates the number of nodes that belongs
  to the ring. This value is used during the initial configuration
  process to determine the number of non-adjacent nodes belonging to
  the same ring.

  For instance, it the ring absolute weight metric of given ring is N
  then by receiving this value (or simply by consulting this value), a
  node belonging to a given ring knows that the number of non-adjacent
  nodes belonging to the same ring equals N-3.

  2. Ring Capacity

  During the initial configuration process, the ring capacity defines
  the number of incoming, outgoing and dropped channels (or
  wavelengths) provisioned at a given node for a given ring ID. These
  values are defined for the working as well as the protection
  capacity. The number of potentially available but unused wavelengths
  by this ring is also announced during the initial configuration
  phase. These wavelengths are consequently left free for other rings
  that can be defined using the same node.

  The ring capacity (per node) is exchanged between adjacent nodes
  until each node belonging to the same ring has received (N-1) copy of
  the ring capacity.

  The knowledge of these values will enable to determine the initial
  working ring load, protection ring load and spare capacity (also
  defined as non-allocated ring load) for the newly configured ring.
  This in turn provides the required information for each node to
  compute the number of potential LSPs that can pass through (i.e. bar-
  state) or be dropped (i.e. cross-state).

  3. Maximum Restoration Time


Internet Draft û Expires August 2001                                14

Draft-papadimitriou-optical-rings-00.txt                 February 2001



  Typically, this static value defines the maximum restoration time
  (MRT) for a given ring type at the initial configuration time. The
  MRT values are distributed between nodes in order to know the
  performance of the other nodes belonging to the same ring.

  With the current state of the usage of all-optical electro-mechanical
  (i.e. MEMS) technology in OXC, typical MRT values are:
  - Bi-directional rings: 1-50ms
  - Unidirectional rings: 1-10ms

  Note that these values are statically configured and only during the
  initial ring configuration period. So, they are not considered during
  the working period of the ring.

3.2.6 Ring Protection Policy

  Ring protection policy refers to the different strategies applicable
  to optical rings. The ring protection policy includes mainly the ring
  protection strategy, the ring protection scheme and ring protection
  priority.

  1. Strategy

  The ring protection strategy could be revertive (default for
  dedicated 1:1 ring protection or shared protection 1:N and M:N ring
  protection) or non-revertive (default for 1+1 rings).

  Depending on the ring protection type, the ring protection strategy
  is determined by the under-laying hardware (or low-layer) opto(-
  electro-)-mechanical technology providing the automatic protection
  switching function. However, these considerations are outside of the
  scope of this document.

  2. Scheme

  The ring policy scheme can be configured as provisioned or non-
  provisioned. The non-provisioned scheme refers to restoration (or re-
  routing) so that this scheme is not generally used when considering
  ring protection in optical networks.

  The provisioned scheme is one used when the protection path or lines
  are left unused and fully dedicated to protection purposes; switching
  to these paths will only occur if a working path or line failure need
  to be recovered.

  3. Priority/Preemption

  The prioritization capability refers to the support of initial setup
  and recovery priority associated with the subsequent link working and
  protection allocated to the LSP established on top of the emulated

  ring. Note that the priority support extends to the signalling
  support of prioritized working and protection LSPs created on a given
  ring.

  The preemption capability refers to the support of link working and
  protection resources pre-emptability in case of link or node failure
  within a given ring.

3.2.7 Summary

  Consequently, the exchange of information between nodes belonging to
  the same ring enables the common knowledge of the identification and
  properties that uniquely define a given optical ring.
  - Ring Identifier
  - Ring Virtual IP Address
  - Ring Protection Type
  - Ring SRLG per link
  - Ring Metric including the absolute ring weight, the ring capacity
  and the ring MRT
  - Ring Policy including ring protection strategy, the ring protection
  scheme, and the priority/preemption support

4. Dynamic Ring Resource Allocation

  The dynamic ring resource allocation process is closely related to
  intra-ring traffic engineering (intra-ring TE). The ring resource
  allocation process is required to dynamically setup Lambda-switched
  LSP segments on top of emulated rings.

4.1 Link TE Resource

  Link TE resources are dynamically exchanged between nodes belonging
  to the same ring to provide the necessary information for intra-ring
  TE. Dynamic Ring Resource Allocation is based on the knowledge of the
  following link TE resource-related information:
  - Link identification (or link bundle identification)
  - Maximum available bandwidth per link
  - Minimum and maximum reservable bandwidth per link
  - Link protection type including unprotected 0:1, dedicated 1:1,
  shared M:N and dedicated 1+1 protection
  - Link priority associated to the minimum/maximum reservable
  bandwidth per link
  - Link priority associated with the link protection type
  - List of SRLGs per link (in order to compute disjoint working and
  protection LSP, for instance)
  - Resource Class/Color defined per link

  The dynamic exchange of this information (IGP link-state
  advertisements) during the working period of the ring enables the
  real-time computation of the value(s) (i.e. the component values)
  defined for the ring TE metric.

4.2 Ring TE Metric

  The ring traffic engineering metric (ring TE metric) can be
  considered as a dynamic ring metric whose component value(s) are
  periodically re-evaluated during the working period of the emulated
  ring. This ring metric is a composed TE metric including the
  following components:
  - a ring weight
  - a ring load
  - a ring maximum restoration time

  1. Ring weight

  In the previous example, the Node A does not know the number of nodes
  the (i.e. hop count) within a given neighboring ring. To make the
  distinction between rings, we introduce the concept of ring weight.
  Ring weight is inversely proportional to number of nodes belonging to
  a ring multiply by 100. The ring weight is defined as:

  Working ring weight = (1/[Number of nodes] x 100) x r1

  where r1 is a weighted integer factor
         r1 is a user customizable integer whose default value equal 1

  For instance, in the above example each ring have a weight of 25
  since 1/[Number of nodes = 4] x 100.

  However, this definition does not allow discriminating between
  working and protection path. So we define a working ring weight and a
  protection ring weight (this applies only to bi-directional rings).

  For bi-directional rings, the ring weight is defined in two flavors:
  - Working ring weight = (1/[Number of nodes] x 100) x r1
  - Protection ring weight = (100 û [Working ring weight]) x r2

  where r1 and r2 are weighted integer factors defined by default as r1
  = 1 and r2 = 1.

  2. Ring Load

  The ring load is only defined for bi-directional rings. The working
  ring load quantity defines, for each direction of propagation, the
  largest number of working LSPs (in any fiber link) flowing in
  opposite direction of the protection LSPs. The working ring load is
  defined at each time interval as:

  Working ring load = [Number of working LSP]

  However, this definition does not give the relative working load of
  the ring compared to its total capacity. So, to normalize the working

Draft-papadimitriou-optical-rings-00.txt                 February 2001


  ring load, this value is divided by the total ring capacity (in terms
  of total number of LSPs).

  Working ring load = [Number of working LSP]/[Total number of LSPs]

  Correspondingly, the protection ring load will be defined as the
  number of protection LSPs divided by the total ring capacity (in
  terms of total number of LSPs). The protection ring load is defined
  at each time interval as:

  Protection ring load = [Number of protection LSP]/[Total number of
  LSPs]

  Consequently, the working ring load, the protection ring load and the
  non-allocated ring load are defined by the following formulas:

  Working Ring Load = ([Number of working LSP]/[Ring capacity] x 100) x
  r3

  Protection Ring Load = ([Number of protection LSP]/[Ring capacity] x
  100) x r4

  Unallocated Ring Load = ((1 û ([Working Ring Load] + [Protection Ring
  Load])/[Ring Capacity]) x 100) x mean(r3,r4)

  Where the r3 and r4 parameters are weighted integer factors, defined
  by default as r3 = 1 = r4.

  3. Maximum Restoration Time

  Typically, this value defines the maximum restoration time (MRT) for
  a given ring type. Typical values are:

  - Bi-directional rings (shared-path): 1-50ms
  - Unidirectional rings (dedicated-path): 1-10ms

  So, we define the associated metric value as:

  MRT = (MRT[N] x 100) x r5

  In this definition, the r5 parameter is a weighted integer factor
  defined by default as equal to 1. Comparing to the MRT defined in the
  ring metric, the values considered here are dynamic. The maximum
  restoration time computation per ring depends on the failure history
  of that ring. Each time a failure is experienced by a ring the MRT
  value is adapted through the use of the following computation:

  If MRT[N]>MRT[N-1]
        then MaxMRT[N] = MRT[N-1] + (k/100 x MRT[N-1]) 
        MRT[N] = Mean(MaxMRT[N]; MinMRT[N-1])

Draft-papadimitriou-optical-rings-00.txt                 February 2001


  If MRT[N]<MRT[N-1]
        then MinMRT[N] = MRT[N-1] û (k/100 x MRT[N-1])
        MRT[N] = Mean(MaxMRT[N-1]; MinMRT[N])

  Where N is defined as the ring restoration process occurrence and k
  is defined as the restoration time in ms experienced during the last
  failure (at the last restoration process occurrence N-1).

  Consequently, the Ring TE Metric is defined as:

  Ring TE Metric = (Working Ring Weight x r1 | Protection Weight x r2)
                    + (Working Ring Load x r3 | Protection Load x r4)
                    + (Maximum Restoration Time x r5)

  The corresponding advertisement will include both the working and the
  protection part of the metric.

5. Ring Protection in Optical Networks

  Within optical networks, the purpose of the ring protection
  mechanisms is to incorporate optical layer survivability in network-
  layered structures. Even if some of the higher layers have their own
  protection mechanisms, by incorporating survivability mechanisms at
  multiple layers leads to the following issues:
  - the protection function allocation to each of the layers
  - the coordination of the protection functions applied at each layer
  during failure recovery process

  Nevertheless, as described in [OPT-MRPS], providing optical layer
  survivability through ring protection has been strongly suggested by
  arguing a combination of optical ring protection with optical linear
  protection as well as additional restoration mechanism provides the
  best optical network survivability.

5.1 Escalation Strategy

  The escalation strategy is defined by the set of detection functions
  describing the originating failure, the protection functions applied
  within recovery process to recover the failure and the interaction
  between the upper and/or lower layers protection functions applied
  during the recovery process. The escalation strategies are governed
  either by arbitrarily setting failure detection and recovery
  completion time (using hold-off timers) or by explicit message
  exchange between the layers.

  Two escalation strategies (also referred to as inter-working
  strategy) have been proposed in [OPT-PRG] and summarized here:
  - Bottom-up strategy starts at closest layer to the failure
  (generally the bottom layer) and escalates toward the upper layer
  upon expiration of the recovery timer (hold timer). This timer is
  defined in such a way that is allocates ôenough timeö the lower

Draft-papadimitriou-optical-rings-00.txt                 February 2001


  layer(s) to detect the failure, execute the recovery process and
  recovery completion time before triggering recovery process defined
  at the higher layer(s).
  - Top-down strategy starts at the upper(most) layer and escalates
  downward to the lower layer(s); depending on the working level, the
  top-down strategy is suitable when each of the layers define Class-
  of-Services (CoS) so that the escalation strategy might take this CoS
  into account when executing the recovery process.

5.2 Bottom-Up Strategy

  We assume here a classical Bottom-up strategy since it has the
  shortest recovery time (with respect to the Top-down escalation
  strategy), and define the threshold at which the upper-layer
  protection needs to be ôexecutedö.

  In optical rings, the following escalation strategy can be defined
  (here we do not assume FSC capable OXC interfaces, so that GMPLS
  signalling is not considered at the lowest layer)

  Packet Layer  <==> PSC interface      <==> GMPLS Signaling

  RS (OTS) Layer   <==> Physical Interface     <==> Layer-1 Mechanisms

  This approach is based on the common coordination achieved by
  resorting escalation strategies. At each level, the resiliency scheme
  is activated sequentially starting from the lower to the upper layer.
  This implies that at each level the detection of a failure condition
  (and restoration time) triggers either a protection/restoration
  mechanism and if the protection/restoration completion time is
  reached then triggers an upper-layer protection/restoration
  mechanism.

5.3 Ring Protection Mechanisms

  In this section the two generic ring protection mechanisms are
  discussed. The main difference between these mechanisms is that the
  dedicated protection performs a physical-layer level protection
  switching while the shared protection needs a dedicated O-APS
  signalling protocol to synchronize the execution of the protection
  switching mechanism.

5.3.1 Dedicated Protection

  Dedicated LSP protection can be easily achieved by splitting the
  incoming optical signal and send the one copy of the output signal
  into working wavelength (or fiber) and the other copy into the
  protection wavelength (or fiber).

  This results in two copies of the signal propagating the ring in
  opposite directions. The far-end (or receive-end) switches to the
  protection wavelength (or fiber) if a degradation or failure occurs.
  The proposed mechanism can restore a single link failure or a single
  node failure.
  Moreover, since the far-end (receiving end) needs to notify the near-
  end (transmitting end) of the failure, an O-APS signalling mechanism
  is not required. However, when a link failure is detected on the
  working ring, the far-end switch to the protection ring (in the
  opposite direction) but for any wavelength flowing through this link,
  so that only a bulk LSP protection switching is achieved by using
  this technique.

  By using the optical signal splitting technique (as described in
  [IPO-MULT]), fast protection is provided for 1+1 LSP protection.
  However, this technique applies only for unidirectional LSP
  protection rings. With this type of rings the optical signal is split
  on both wavelengths (fibers) at the transmission end.

5.3.2 Shared Protection

  Shared protection is mainly based on the use of an O-APS signalling
  protocol (using the signalling IP-based control-plane). The
  requirements as well as the specifications for the specification of

  such an IP-based protocol need to be seriously determined in order to
  achieve a fast protection switching mechanism. The specifications of
  the O-APS protocol are extensively detailed in [IPO-OAPS].

6. Routing in Optical Rings and Hybrid Mesh-Ring Networks

   In optical networks, the following hierarchical routing model can be
  considered:
   - the intra-domain interfaces are included in an IGP (more precisely
  link-state routing protocols) routing protocol instance included
  within the same autonomous-system (AS)
   - the inter-domain interfaces are defined between autonomous-systems
  running over eBGP routing protocol.

   The eBGP protocol is running between border LSRs (which from the
  OSPF point-of-view are considered as an Autonomous System Boundary
  Router - ASBR). The hierarchical optical network model provides the
  capacity to connect several autonomous systems (i.e. optical domains)
  together through eBGP protocol.

6.1 Intra-Domain Routing

  The optical network architecture considered here is build such as the
  corresponding control plane defines an hierarchical optical topology
  as described in [IPO-FRAME]. Consequently, intra-domain routing can
  be considered when the IP-based control plane defines an OSPF
  Autonomous System (AS) on top of an hierarchical optical domain
  (which defines the transport plane). The same considerations can be
  applied when using IS-IS IGP protocol in hierarchical optical
  networks.

  With the intra-domain architecture, transparent optical network
  devices (i.e. OXC including O/E/O conversion) are located at the
  border of the corresponding areas. Consequently, OXC might be
  considered as internal LSR as well as border LSR. All-optical network
  devices (i.e. PXC without O/E/O conversion) are predominantly
  configured as internal LSR but might in particular cases be
  configured as border LSR.

  Taking into account this optical network topology:
  - Ring CEFG defines backbone area 0
  - Ring ABCD, HIJE, KGLM and FNOP define non-backbone area

  In this hierarchical network topology, each of these nodes can be
  considered as an abstract node so that each of them can also be
  considered as defining an optical ring. Moreover, each of these areas
  can include internal all-optical rings. However, in that case, the
  only restriction is related to the Area Border Routers (ABR i.e.
  border LSR) that can not be all-optical PXC. In order to avoid
  optical signal regeneration related problems, one can consider here
  that border LSRs are O/E/O transparent devices like OXCs.

6.2 Inter-domain Routing

  Inter-domain Optical Routing is considered when defining inter-
  optical domain routing between several carriers. In the most basic
  network topology, optical domains (i.e. BGP AS) are inter-connected
  through direct links (or redundant links) combined with linear
  protection mechanisms as represented in the following figure:

  In this topology, the Nodes CEFG can define an inter-domain ring.
  This enhancement provides higher resiliency to the classical inter-
  domain connections since in that case ring protection mechanism can

  be used. However, the most reliable topology will be achieved when
  the optical domains are inter-connected through a BGP Transit AS.
  When considering a Transit AS, the Client AS can be inter-connected
  by using optical rings or direct links to the Transit AS.

  As mentioned above the use of a meshed inter-connectivity between
  nodes does not preclude the use linear protection (and restoration)
  mechanisms such as dedicated 1+1 or shared (1:1, 1:N, M:N) LSP
  protection.

  connection approach:

             Optical Rings                   Direct Links

  As mentioned before, a trade-off between link (or wavelength)
  redundancy and lost capacity need to be defined. However, these
  considerations are out of the scope of this document.

6.3 Inter-Ring Traffic-Engineering

  As described in the previous section, the network hierarchical model
  considered is divided into Autonomous Systems (ASs), where each AS is
  divided into IGP areas to allow the hiding, aggregation and
  summarization of routing information. The hierarchical routing model
  currently can be extended for traffic engineering as it hides the
  route taken by a LSP to the destinations in the other routing areas.
  Hence, from the TE perspective, requirements such as path selection
  and crank-back mechanism need different architectural additions to
  the existing link-state routing and signaling protocols for inter-
  area LSP setup. The protection requirements as well as crank-back
  mechanisms can be implemented by using the optical ring techniques
  described in this document.

Draft-papadimitriou-optical-rings-00.txt                 February 2001



  Note that in a fully distributed approach, since LSRs in different
  ASÆs have different views of the network at any given time, re-
  routing and crank-back mechanisms are needed. This approach requires
  also to clearly defining when the steady state of the optical network
  is reached in order to execute the protection/restoration mechanisms
  specified in the escalation strategy to apply when failure(s) occurs.
  The problems related to LSP protection/restoration are also described
  in [IPO-REST].

  Traffic engineering (TE) practice currently involves the setup and
  use of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) as dedicated bandwidth pipes
  between two end points (i.e. between an ingress and an egress LSR).
  LSPs can be setup across several LSRs through the use of dynamically
  computed path. Since this memo focuses on fully distributed CSPF path
  computation, we consider here that the routes can be computed
  dynamically through the use of online constraint-based routing
  algorithms such as incremental Linear or Heap Dijkstra Algorithm (or
  Dijkstra-like algorithms for non-additive metrics) as described for
  instance in [SPT-DYN]).

  The online constraint-based routing model requires:
  (1) a set of flooding mechanism to maintain the state of TE-related
  information within the optical network topology
  (2) a constraint-based routing process implemented on certain LSRs
  that serve as ingress LSRs for the LSPs,
  (3) a topology change(s) within the optical domain does not result in
  a complete re-computation of the routes

  Most of the traffic engineering extensions for intra-area TE routing
  are described in [OSPF-TE] and [GMPLS-OSPF] the latter in particular
  when considering intra-area GMPLS TE routing. Note that new traffic
  engineering attributes can be defined in future versions of this
  document. We describe here the TE extensions for inter-ring TE
  routing in optical ring topologies when considering summarization of
  the TE values at boundaries (see also [OSPF-IRTE] concerning
  summarization of TE attributes).

  As described in [OSPF-IRTE], traffic engineering (TE) summary LSA can
  be originated at Area Border Router (ABR) into an area. This TE
  summary LSA is a type-10 opaque LSA flooded within the area. The
  functionality of the TE summary LSA is similar to the one of summary
  LSA of standard OSPF [RFC2328], but in addition it carries the
  traffic engineering metrics to the remote destination (IP network or
  ASBR). The inter-ring TE summary LSA described here has exactly the
  same functionality except that the corresponding LSA is generated at
  ring boundary nodes.

6.3.1 Ring Count

Draft-papadimitriou-optical-rings-00.txt                 February 2001


  The ring count is the cost in rings to reach the destination network
  (or the destination ring) from the source node (or the source ring).
  This parameter is equivalent to the hop count defined in [OSPF-IRTE]
  since a ring appears as an abstract node for the neighboring rings or
  OXCs (not belonging to the same ring). The ring count (as the hop
  count) is an additive metric. Note that the ring count can be
  generalized to an additive weighted metric.

6.3.2 Maximum Reservable Bandwidth

  The maximum reservable bandwidth is defined as the smallest maximum
  reservable bandwidth among all the rings included into the path from
  the source to the destination.

  Note the maximum reservable bandwidth should be the same for the
  working and the protected path.

6.3.3 Minimum Reservable Bandwidth

  The minimum reservable bandwidth is defined as the largest minimum
  reservable bandwidth among all the rings included into the path from
  the source to the destination.

  Note the minimum reservable bandwidth should be the same for the
  working and the protected path.

6.3.4 Delay

  The delay attribute is defined as the delay cost to reach the
  destination ring in microseconds. The delay is defined an average
  delay taking into account the delay introduced by the worst case
  protection path and best case working path since this value can not
  up to now be updated dynamically. The delay is an additive metric
  that could be generalized to an additive weighted metric.

  Note that the delay of the working path could be different from the
  delay of the protected path.

6.3.5 Resource Class/Coloring

  The resource class or color of the destination network is a
  combination of the colors for the various ringed paths to the
  destination network. Path coloring technique can be found in [IPO-
  PATH].

  Path coloring can be used to prune resources as a first step of the
  LSP route computation and as a tie when two distinct routes having
  the same Inter-Ring TE Metric (see section 6.3.6) to the same
  destination network may be used but only differ from their color. In
  that case, the choice of one route or another is a local policy
  matter.

6.3.6 Inter-ring TE Metric

  The inter-ring TE metric is defined as the TE metric representing the
  TE cost of reaching the destination network (or the destination ring)
  from the advertising ring.

  This metric is composition of ring TE metrics (described in section
  4.2) defined by the following formula:

  Inter-Ring TE Metric =
                (Working Ring Weight x r1 | Protected Weight x r2)
                + (Working Ring Load x r3 | Protected Load x r4)
                + (Maximum Restoration Time x r5)

  So that the inter-ring TE metric is defined as the weighted sum of
  the ring metrics and representing the traffic-engineering cost of
  reaching the destination ring (i.e. Ring N) from the advertising ring
  (i.e. Ring 1).

  Ring TE Metric = k[1] x Ring Metric 1 + k[2] x Ring Metric 2
                        k[n-1] Ring Metric N-1 à k[n] x Ring Metric N

6.4 Routing Protocol Extensions for Dynamic Ring Configuration

  We describe here the IGP routing protocol extensions needed in order
  to enable dynamic ring configuration within an area (intra-area
  routing) between areas (inter-area routing).

6.4.1 Opaque LSA

  Opaque LSA are application specific link-state advertisements defined
  in [OSPF-OPA] used mainly for IGP traffic engineering (TE) extension
  purposes, see for instance [OSPF-TE] concerning intra-area TE routing
  and [OSPF-IRTE] concerning inter-area TE routing.

  The [RFC2370] describing the Opaque LSAs concepts for application
  specific information distributed additionally to the IGP routing
  information. In [OSPF-OPA], three types of Opaque LSA were defined:
  - Type-9 Opaque LSA: link-local scope
  - Type-10 Opaque LSA: area-local scope (or intra-area scope)
  - Type-11 Opaque LSA: Autonomous System (AS) scope (or inter-area
  scope)

  The flooding scope associated with each Opaque link-state type is
  defined as follows.
  - Type-9 Opaque LSAs are not flooded beyond the local sub-network.
  - Type-10 Opaque LSAs are not flooded beyond the borders of their
  associated area.
  - Type-11 Opaque LSAs are flooded throughout the Autonomous System
  (AS) and is equivalent to the flooding scope of AS-external (type-5)

  LSAs.

  As a generic rule, see [RFC2370], when flooding Opaque-LSAs to
  adjacent neighbors, an opaque-capable router looks at the neighbor's
  opaque capability.  Opaque LSAs are only flooded to opaque-capable
  neighbors. When a non-opaque-capable router inadvertently receive
  Opaque LSAs, it simply discard the Opaque LSA.

  Consequently, to achieve intra-area dynamic ring configuration we use
  Opaque LSAs of Type 10 area-local flooding scope.

6.4.2 Opaque LSA Header

  Opaque LSAs are types 9, 10 and 11 link-state advertisements.  The
  Link-State ID [RFC2328] of the Opaque LSA is divided into an Opaque
  Type field (8-bit sub-field) and a Opaque Type-specific ID (24-bit
  sub-field). The range of topological distribution (i.e., the flooding
  scope) of an Opaque LSA is identified by its link-state type.

  In Opaque LSAs are application specific LSAs meaning that their
  payload has meaning only within a certain application; otherwise,
  they will be ignored. The Opaque Type that is contained in the Opaque
  Type field identifies the type of the application.

  The Opaque Type-specific ID (i.e. Opaque ID) is a 24-bit sub-field
  sub-divided in a reserved sub-field (8 MSB) and a Source specific
  sub-field (16 LSB).

  where LS Type value = 9, 10 or 11

  For the purpose of dynamic ring configuration, only Opaque LSA Type-
  10 will be considered. Moreover the dynamic ring configuration Opaque
  Type still remains to be determined.

  As described in [OSPF-OPA], the Opaque LSA payload consists of one or
  more nested Type/Length/Value (TLV) structures. The format of the
  Opaque LSA TLV structure is defined as:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

  The following additional TLV need to be defined in order to enable
  dynamic ring configuration through the use of application-specific
  Opaque LSAs.

   1. Ring ID TLV

  The Ring ID is defined as a 32-bit integer field that uniquely
  identifies a given ring within a given optical domain (i.e.
  administrative authority).

   0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

  A additional field might be defined in the future to identify the
  Autonomous System number (16-bit) into which the ring is included.

   2. Ring Virtual Address TLV

  Each node included within a given ring shares a unique virtual IPv4
  Address with other nodes belonging to the same ring. The IPv4 address
  is uniquely defined per administrative authority. This information is
  exchanged between nodes by using the following TLV:

    0                   1                   2                   3

  One loopback IPv4 address is allocated per node in order to avoid
  communication disruption between nodes belonging to the same ring
  when a given node interface becomes unreachable. The local loopback
  IPv4 address must be the first one included in the loopback IPv4
  address list.

  For each ring contiguous to a given node, an additional loopback IPv4
  address is allocated. Since a ring is viewed as an abstract single
  node for its neighboring OXC, these loopback IP addresses identify
  the abstract node constituted by a ring for the neighboring nodes
  (external to this ring) and neighboring rings.

   4. Ring Protection Type TLV

  The Optical Ring Protection Type (encoded as an 8-bit flagged field)
  is defined as:
  - Ring technology: Optical (Bit0=0) or OTH-based (Bit0=1)
  - Ring Protection: Dedicated (Bit1=0) or Shared (Bit1=1)
  - Ring Protection level: Link-level (Bit2=0) or Path-level (Bit2=1)
  - Ring Protection fibers: 2-fiber (Bit3=0) or 4-fiber (Bit3=1)
  - Ring switching: ring-switch (Bit4=0) or span-switch (Bit4=1)
  - Other values (3 bits) are reserved for future use

   The corresponding TLV is defined as:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   5. Link TLV

  To encode the list of SRLG(s) to which a given link belongs, we
  propose to use the Link TLV by including the following sub-TLVs:


Internet Draft û Expires August 2001                                30

Draft-papadimitriou-optical-rings-00.txt                 February 2001


  - Link ID (32-bit)
  - Link Local Interface ID (32-bit)
  - Link Remote Interface ID (32-bit)
  - Link Encoding Type (8-bit)
  - Link Protection Type (8-bit)
  - List of SRLG(s) (n x 32-bit)

  The corresponding TLV are already defined in [GMPLS-OSPF] and [OSPF-
  TE]. Note that for optical rings, the relevant Link Protection Type
  are dedicated 1+1, dedicated 1:1, shared M:N and unprotected 0:1.

  Additional sub-TLVs can also be included within the Link TLV for
  intra-ring traffic engineering purposes. So, we can refer to these
  sub-TLVs as Link TE sub-TLVs:
  - Maximum Available Bandwidth per link
  - Minimum and Maximum Reservable Bandwidth per link
  - Link Priority associated to Minimum/Maximum Reservable Bandwidth
  - Link Priority associated with the Link Protection Type
  - Resource Class/Color defined per link

  The link resource allocation is performed dynamically here;
  consequently the Link TLV does not need to include the Ring ID to
  which this link might be allocated (or de-allocated) during the
  working period of the ring. A given link can include several
  wavelengths belonging to more than one ring if this is a shared link.
  This means that the per-ring resource allocation

  Note also that even if a fiber link can belong to more than one ring
  (if the link is defined as a boundary link) the wavelengths available
  on that link when allocated to one ring, they can not be shared by
  the other ring.

   6. Ring Metric TLV

  As described in section 3.6, the ring metric is a component metric
  including the ring absolute weight, the ring capacity and the ring
  initial MRT.

  The corresponding TLV is defined as follows:

   0                   1                   2                   3

  The Ring Metric TLV includes:
  - Ring absolute weight (8-bit): number of nodes belonging to the same
  ring ID
  - Ring initial MRT (24-bit): in microsecond units
  - Ring capacity:
        . number of working wavelengths: incoming (14-bit), outgoing
        (14-bit) and dropped (14-bit)
        . number of protection wavelengths: incoming (14-bit) and
        outgoing (14-bit)
        . number of unused wavelengths (28-bit) for this ring

   7. Ring Protection Policy TLV

  Ring protection policy refers to the different strategies applicable
  to optical rings. The ring protection policy includes mainly the ring
  protection strategy, the ring protection scheme and ring resource
  priority and preemptability support. The Ring Protection Policy TLV
  format is defined as:

   0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

  The values are defined as follows:

  The ring protection strategy:
  - Bit 0 set to 0 defines a non-revertive strategy
  - Bit 0 set to 1 defines a revertive strategy

  The ring protection scheme:
  - Bit 1 set to 0 defines a provisioned scheme
  - Bit 1 set to 1 defines a non-provisioned scheme

  The ring resource Priority-Preemption:
  - Bit 2 set to 0 enables setup pre-emptability of working and
  protection link resources during LSP setup process (meaning implicit
  priority support for link resources)
  - Bit 2 set to 1 disables setup pre-emptability of working and
  protection link resources during LSP setup process
  - Bit 3 set to 0 enables recovery pre-emptability of working and
  protection link resources during LSP recovery process (meaning
  implicit priority support for link resources)

  - Bit 3 set to 1 disables recovery pre-emptability of working and
  protection link resources during LSP recovery process

   Other bits (bit 4 to 31) are reserved for future use.


6.5 Routing Protocol Extensions for Dynamic Ring Resource Allocation

  The only additional TLVs to define as additional Opaque LSA payload
  is the Ring TE Metric TLV. Other traffic engineering extensions such
  as Link TE TLVs have already been defined in [OSPF-TE] and [GMPLS-
  OSPF].

   1. Ring TE Metric TLV

  The Ring TE Metric is a component metric including the ring weight,
  the ring load and the ring MRT.

  The Working TE Metric (16-bit) part of the Ring TE Metric includes
  the following components
  - the working ring weight
  - the working ring load
  - the computed MRT

  The Protection TE Metric (16-bit) part of the Ring TE Metric includes
  the following components:
  - the protection ring weight
  - the protection ring load
  - the computed MRT

  The Ring TE Metric TLV is encoded as:

    0                   1                   2                   3

  |       Working TE Metric       |     Protection TE Metric      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

7. Signaling Extensions in Ring Protected optical networks

  The signaling extensions are related to the following functions:
  - signalling of the working and the protected path from source ring
  node to the destination ring node
  - specific signaling extension in order to support drop-and-continue
  functionality; this is equivalent to define signalling extension for
  point-to-multipoint LSP

  Drop-and-continue function can be required when considering protected
  ring interconnection:


Internet Draft û Expires August 2001                                33

Draft-papadimitriou-optical-rings-00.txt                 February 2001


  - For dedicated-protection ring inter-connection: drop-and-continue
  function is used together with path selector function
  - For shared-protection ring inter-connection: drop-and-continue
  function is used together with service selector function
  - For both type of ring are inter-connected: drop-and-continued is
  used together with path selector function (dedicated-protection ring)
  and service selector function (shared-protection ring)

7.1 Intra-ring signalling extension

  When entering the ring, the signaling of the working and the
  protected channel need to be executed simultaneously.

  The principle defined for this purpose is to æsplitÆ the signaling
  message (corresponding to the LSP create message) for the working and
  protected path through the corresponding signalling channel. For this
  purpose, the same technique as the one defined in [IPO-REST] can be
  applied. The proposed mechanism applied to emulated rings provides
  the suitable signalling extensions for the creation of backup LSP
  segments from the ingress to egress ring node when LSP protection is
  required.

  [IPO-MULT] proposes a more efficient mechanism to achieve this by
  considering the split of the physical optical signal. In that case,
  fast protection is provided for the 1+1 protected LSP. However, this
  technique applies only for unidirectional LSP protection rings. With
  this type of rings the optical signal is split on both wavelengths
  (fibers) at the transmission end. This results in two copies of the
  signal propagating the ring in opposite directions. The far-end (or
  receive-end) switches to the protection wavelength (or fiber) if a
  failure occurs. The proposed mechanism can restore a single link
  failure or a single node failure.

  When using 1+1 LSP protection, since the far-end (receiving end) does
  need to notify the near-end (transmitting end) of the failure, an O-
  APS signalling mechanism is not required. The decision is made at the
  far-end on an LSP-by-LSP basis.

7.2 Inter-ring signalling extension

  Inter-ring signalling extensions are considered for drop-and-continue
  ring inter-connection. In this case, the signalling message (i.e. the
  LSP create message) need to be continued meaning duplicated when
  reaching the primary destination node (far end) for that LSP. However
  only one LSP must be defined (in particular only one LSP segment
  needs to be defined from the ingress to egress ring nodes). Details
  concerning inter-ring signalling extensions are left for further
  study.
