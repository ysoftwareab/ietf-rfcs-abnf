Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) has become established as a core
   component of Software Defined Networking (SDN) systems.  It can
   compute optimal paths for traffic across a network for any definition
   of "optimal" and can also monitor changes in resource availability
   and traffic demands to update the paths.

   Conventionally, the PCE has been used to derive paths for MPLS Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs).  These paths are supplied using the Path
   Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) to the head end of
   the LSP for signaling in the MPLS network.

   SDN has a far broader applicability than just signaled MPLS traffic
   engineered networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a
   wide range of use cases including static LSPs, segment routing,
   service function chaining (SFC), and indeed any form of routed or
   switched network.  It is, therefore, reasonable to consider PCEP as a
   general southbound control protocol for use in these environments to
   allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a central controller.

   This document briefly introduces the architecture for PCE as a
   central controller, examines the motivations and applicability for
   PCEP as a southbound interface, and introduces the implications for
   the protocol.  This document does not describe the use cases in
   detail and does not define protocol extensions: that work is left for
   other documents.

1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] was developed to offload
   path computation function from routers in an MPLS traffic engineered
   network.  Since then, the role and function of the PCE has grown to
   cover a number of other uses (such as GMPLS [RFC7025]) and to allow
   delegated control [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and PCE-initiated use
   of network resources [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp].

   According to [RFC7399], Software Defined Networking (SDN) refers to a
   separation between the control elements and the forwarding components
   so that software running in a centralized system, called a
   controller, can act to program the devices in the network to behave
   in specific ways.  A required element in an SDN architecture is a
   component that plans how the network resources will be used and how
   the devices will be programmed.  It is possible to view this
   component as performing specific computations to place traffic flows
   within the network given knowledge of the availability of network
   resources, how other forwarding devices are programmed, and the way
   that other flows are routed.  This is the function and purpose of a
   PCE, and the way that a PCE integrates into a wider network control
   system (including an SDN system) is presented in [RFC7491].

   In early PCE implementations, where the PCE was used to derive paths
   for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), paths were requested by network
   elements (known as Path Computation Clients - PCCs) and the results
   of the path computations were supplied to network elements using the
   Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440].
   This protocol was later extended to allow a PCE to send unsolicited
   requests to the network for LSP establishment
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp].

   SDN has a far broader applicability than just signaled MPLS or GMPLS
   traffic engineered networks.  The PCE component in an SDN system may
   be used to determine paths in a wide range of use cases including
   static LSPs, segment routing [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing],
   service function chaining (SFC) [RFC7665], and indeed any form of
   routed or switched network.  It is, therefore, reasonable to consider

   PCEP as a general southbound control protocol for use in these
   environments to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a central
   controller.

   This document introduces the architecture for PCE as a central
   controller, examines the motivations and applicability for PCEP as a
   southbound interface, and introduces the implications for the
   protocol.  This document does not describe the use cases in detail
   and does not define protocol extensions: that work is left for other
   documents.

2.  Architecture

   The architecture for the use of PCE within centralized control of a
   network is based on the understanding that a PCE can determine how
   connections should be placed and how resources should be used within
   the network, and that the PCE can then cause those connections to be
   established.  Figure 1 shows how this control relationship works in a
   network with an active control plane.  This is a familiar view for
   those who have read and understood [RFC4655] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp].

   In this mode of operation, the central controller is asked to create
   connectivity by a network orchestrator, a service manager, an
   Operations Support System (OSS), a Network Management Station (NMS),
   or some other application.  The PCE-based controller computes paths
   with awareness of the network topology, the available resources, and
   the other services supported in the network.  This information is
   held in the Traffic Engineering Database (TED) and other databases
   available to the PCE.  Then the PCE sends a request using PCEP to one
   of the Network Elements (NEs), and that NE uses a control plane to
   establish the requested connections and reserve the network
   resources.

     Figure 1: Architecture for Central Controller with Control Plane

   Although the architecture shown in Figure 1 represents a form of SDN,
   one objective of SDN in some environments is to remove the dependency
   on a control plane.  A transition architecture toward this goal is
   presented in [RFC7491] and is shown in Figure 2.  In this case,
   services are still requested in the same way, and the PCE-based
   controller still requests use of the network using PCEP.  The main
   difference is that the consumer of the PCEP messages is a Network
   Controller that provisions the resources and instructs the data plane
   using a Southbound Interface (SBI) that provides an interface to each
   NE.

           Figure 2: Architecture Including a Network Controller

   The approach in Figure 2 delivers the SDN functionality but is overly
   complicated and insufficiently flexible.

   o  The complication is created by the use of two controllers in a
      hierarchical organization, and the resultant use of two protocols
      in a southbound direction.

   o  The lack of flexibility arises from the assumed or required lack
      of a control plane.

   This document describes an architecture that reduces the number of
   components and is flexible to a number of deployment models and use
   cases.  In this hybrid approach (shown in Figure 3) the network
   controller is PCE-enabled and can also speak PCEP as the SBI (i.e.,
   it can communicate with each node along the path using PCEP).  That
   means that the controller can communicate with a conventional control
   plane-enabled NE using PCEP and can also use the same protocol to
   program individual NEs.  In this way the PCE-based controller can

   control a wider range of networks and deliver many different
   functions as described in Section 3.

   PCEP is essentially already capable of acting as an SBI and only
   small, use case- specific modifications to the protocol are needed to
   support this architecture.  The implications for the protocol are
   discussed further in Section 4.

          Figure 3: Architecture for Node-by-Node Central Control

2.1.  Resilience and Scaling

   Systems with central controllers are vulnerable to two problems:
   failure or overload of the single controller.  These concerns are not
   unique to the use of a PCE-based controller, but need to be addressed
   in this document before the PCE-based controller architecture can be
   considered for use in all but the smallest networks.

   There are three architectural mechanisms that can be applied to
   address these issues.  The mechanisms are described separately for
   clarity, but a deployment use may any combination of the approaches.

Internet-Draft             PCE-CC Architecture             December 2016


   For simplicity of illustration, these three approaches are shown in
   the sections that follow without a control plane.  However, the
   general, hybrid approach of Figure 3 is applicable in each case.

2.1.1.  Partitioned Network

   The first and simplest approach to handling controller overload or
   scalability is to use multiple controllers, each responsible for a
   part of the network.  We can call the resultant areas of control
   "domains."

   This approach is shown in Figure 4.  It can clearly address some of
   the scaling and overload concerns since each controller now only has
   responsibility for a subset of the network elements.  But this comes
   at a cost because end-to-end connections require coordination between
   the controllers.  Furthermore, this technique does not remove the
   single-point-of-failure concern even if it does reduce the impact on
   the network of the failure of a single controller.

   Note that PCEP is designed to work as a PCE-to-PCE protocol as well
   as a PCE-to-PCC protocol, so it should be possible to use it to
   coordinate between PCE-based controllers in this model.

          Figure 4: Multiple Controllers on a Partitioned Network

2.1.2.  Multiple Parallel Controllers

   Multiple parallel controllers may be deployed as shown in Figure 5.
   Each controller is capable of controlling all of the network elements
   thus the failure of any one controller will not leave the network
   unmanageable and, in normal circumstances, the load can be
   distributed across the controllers.

   To achieve full redundancy and to be able to continue to provide full
   function in the event of the failure a controller, the controllers
   must synchronize with each other.  This is nominally a simple task if
   there are just two controllers, but can actually be quite complex if
   state changes in the network are not to be lost.  Furthermore, if
   there are more than two controllers, the synchronization between
   controllers can become a hard problem.

   Synchronization issues are often off-loaded as "database
   synchronization" problems because distributed database packages have
   already had to address these challenges.  In networking the problem
   may also be addressed by collecting the state from the network
   (effectively using the network as a database) using normal routing
   protocols such as OSPF, IS-IS, and BGP.

                 Figure 5: Multiple Redundant Controllers

2.1.3.  Hierarchical Controllers

   Figure 6 shows an approach with hierarchical controllers.  This
   approach was developed for PCEs in [RFC6805] and appears in various
   SDN architectures where a "parent PCE", an "orchestrator", or "super
   controller" takes responsibility for a high-level view of the network
   before distributing tasks to lower level PCEs or controllers.

   On its own, this approach does little to protect against the failure
   of a controller, but it can make significant improvements in loading
   and scaling of the individual controllers.  It also offers a good way
   to support end-to-end connectivity across multiple administrative or
   technology-specific domains.

   Note that this model can be arbitrarily recursive with a PCE-based
   controller being the child of one parent PCE-based controller while
   acting as the parent of another set of PCE-based controllers.

3.  Applicability

   This section gives a very high-level introduction to the
   applicability of a PCE-based centralized controller.  There is no
   attempt to explain each use case in detail, and the inclusion of a
   use case is not intended to suggest that deploying a PCE-based
   controller is a mandatory or recommended approach.  The sections
   below are provided as a stimulus to discussion of the applicability
   of a PCE-based controller and it is expected that separate documents
   will be written to develop the use cases in which there is interest
   for implementation and deployment.  As described in Section 4
   specific enhancements to PCEP may be needed for some of these use

   cases and it is expected that the documents that develop each use
   case will also address any extensions to PCEP.

   The rest of this section is divided into two sub-sections.  The first
   approaches the question of applicability from a consideration of the
   network technology.  The second looks at the high-level functions
   that can be delivered by using a PCE-based controller.

   As previously mentioned, this section is intended to just make
   suggestions.  Thus the material supplied is very brief.  The omission
   of a use case is in no way meant to imply some limit on the
   applicability of PCE-based control.

3.1.  Technology-Oriented Applicability

   This section provides a list of use cases based on network
   technology.

3.1.1.  Applicability to Control Plane Operated Networks

   This mode of operation is the common approach for an active, stateful
   PCE to control a traffic engineered MPLS or GMPLS network
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].  Note that the PCE-based controller
   determines what LSPs are needed and where to place them.  PCEP is
   used to instruct the head end of each LSP, and the head end signals
   in the control plane to set up the LSP.

3.1.2.  Static LSPs in MPLS

   Static LSPs are provisioned without the use of a control plane.  This
   means that they are established using management plane or "manual"
   configuration.

   Static LSPs can be provisioned as 1-hop, micro-LSPs at each node
   along the path of an end-to-end path LSP.  Each router along the path
   must be told what label forwarding instructions to program and what
   resources to reserve.  The PCE-based controller keeps a view of the
   network and determines the paths of the end-to-end LSPs just as it
   does for the use case described in Section 3.1.1, but the controller
   uses PCEP to communicate with each router along the path of the end-
   to-end LSP.  In this case the PCE-based controller will take
   responsibility for managing some part of the MPLS label space for
   each of the routers that it controls, and may taker wider
   responsibility for partitioning the label space for each router and
   allocating different parts for different uses communicating the
   ranges to the router using PCEP.

Internet-Draft             PCE-CC Architecture             December 2016


3.1.3.  MPLS Multicast

   Multicast LSPs may be provisioned with a control plane or as static
   LSPs.  No extra considerations apply above those in Section 3.1.1 and
   Section 3.1.2 except, of course, to note that the PCE must also
   include the instructions about where the LSP branches, i.e., where
   packets must be copied.

3.1.4.  Transport SDN

   Transport SDN (T-SDN) is the application of SDN techniques to
   transport networks.  In this respect a transport network is a network
   built from any technology below the IP layer and designed to carry
   traffic transparently in a connection-oriented way.  Thus, an MPLS
   traffic engineering network is a transport network although it is
   more common to consider technologies such as Time Division
   Multiplexing (TDM) and Optical Transport Networks (OTN).

   Transport networks may be operated with or without a control plane
   and may have point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connections.
   Thus, all of the considerations in Section 3.1.1, Section 3.1.2, and
   Section 3.1.3 apply.  It may be the case that additional technology-
   specific parameters are needed to configure the NEs and these
   parameters will need to be carried in the PCEP messages.

3.1.5.  Segment Routing

   Segment routing is described in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing].
   It relies on a series of forwarding instructions being placed in the
   header or a packet.  At each hop in the network a router looks at the
   first instruction and may: continue to forward the packet unchanged;
   strip the top instruction and forward the packet; or strip the top
   instruction, insert some additional instructions, and forward the
   packet.

   The segment routing architecture supports operations that can be used
   to steer packet flows in a network thus providing a form of traffic
   engineering.  A PCE-based controller can be responsible for computing
   the paths for packet flows in a segment routing network, for
   configuring the forwarding actions on the routers, and for telling
   the edge routers what instructions to attach to packets as they enter
   the network.  These last two operations can be achieved using PCEP
   and the PCE-based controller will assume responsibility for managing
   the space of labels or path identifiers used to determine how packets
   are forwarded.

3.1.6.  Service Function Chaining

   Service Function Chaining (SFC) is described in [RFC7665].  It is the
   process of directing traffic in a network such that it passes through
   specific hardware devices or virtual machines (known as service
   function nodes) that can perform particular desired functions on the
   traffic.  The set of functions to be performed and the order in which
   they are to be performed is known as a Service Function Chain.  The
   chain is enhanced with the locations at which the service functions
   are to be performed to derive a Service Function Path (SFP).  Each
   packet is marked as belonging to a specific SFP and that marking lets
   each successive service function node know which functions to perform
   and to which service function node to send the packet next.

   To operate an SFC network the service function nodes must be
   configured to understand the packet markings and the edge nodes must
   be told how to mark packets entering the network.  Additionally it
   may be necessary to establish tunnels between service function nodes
   to carry the traffic.

   Planning an SFC network requires load balancing between service
   function nodes and traffic engineering across the network that
   connects them.  These are operations that can be performed by a PCE-
   based controller, and that controller can use PCEP to program the
   network and install the service function chains and any required
   tunnels.

3.2.  High-Level Applicability

   This section provides a list of the high-level functions that can be
   delivered by using a PCE-based controller.

3.2.1.  Traffic Engineering

   According to [RFC2702], Traffic Engineering (TE) is concerned with
   performance optimization of operational networks.  In general, it
   encompasses the application of technology and scientific principles
   to the measurement, modeling, characterization, control of Internet
   traffic, and the application of such knowledge and techniques to
   achieve specific performance objectives.

   From a practical point of view this involves having an understanding
   of the topology of the network, the characteristics of the nodes and
   links in the network, and the traffic demands and flows across the
   network.  It also requires that actions can be taken to ensure that
   traffic follows specific paths through the network.





Farrel, et al.            Expires June 8, 2017                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft             PCE-CC Architecture             December 2016


   PCE was specifically developed to address TE in an MPLS network, and
   so a PCE-based controller is well suited to analyze TE problems and
   supply answers that can be installed in the network using PCEP.  PCEP
   can be responsible for initiating paths across the network through a
   control plane, or for installing state in the network node by node
   such as in a Segment Routed network (see Section 3.1.5) or by
   configuring IGP metrics.

3.2.2.  Traffic Classification

   Traffic classification is an important part of traffic engineering.
   It is the process of looking at a packet to determine how it should
   be treated as it is forwarded through the network.  It applies in
   many scenarios including MPLS traffic engineering (where it
   determines what traffic is forwarded onto which LSPs), segment
   routing (where it is used to select which set of forwarding
   instructions to add to a packet), and service function chaining
   (where it indicates along which service function path a packet should
   be forwarded).  In conjunction with traffic engineering, traffic
   classification is an important enabler for load balancing.

   Traffic classification is closely linked to the computational
   elements of planning for the network functions just listed because it
   determines how traffic load is balanced and distributed through the
   network.  Therefore, selecting what traffic classification should be
   performed by a router is an important part of the work done by a PCE-
   based controller.

   Instructions can be passed from the controller to the routers using
   PCEP.  These instructions tell the routers how to map traffic to
   paths or connections.  The instructions may use the concept of a
   Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC).

3.2.3.  Service Delivery

   Various network services may be offered over a network.  These
   include protection services (including end-to-end protection
   [RFC4427], restoration after failure, and fast reroute [RFC4090]),
   Virtual Private Network (VPN) service (such as Layer 3 VPNs [RFC4364]
   or Ethernet VPNs [RFC7432]), or Pseudowires [RFC3985].

   Delivering services over a network in an optimal way requires
   coordination in the way that network resources are allocated to
   support the services.  A PCE-based central controller can consider
   the whole network and all components of a service at once when
   planning how to deliver the service.  It can then use PCEP to manage
   the network resources and to install the necessary associations
   between those resources.

4.  Protocol Implications

   PCEP is a push-pull protocol that is designed to move requests and
   responses between a server (the PCE) and clients (the PCCs, i.e., the
   network elements).  In particular, it has a message (PCInitiate
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp]) that can be sent by the PCE to
   install state or cause actions at the PCC, and a response message
   (PCRpt) that is used to confirm the request.

   As such, there is an expectation that only relatively minor changes
   to PCEP are required to support the concept of a PCE-based
   controller.  The only work expected to be needed is small extensions
   to carry additional or specific information elements for the
   individual use cases.  Where possible, consistent with the general
   principles of how protocols are extended, any additions to the
   protocol should be made in a generic way such that they are open to
   use in a range of applications.

   It is anticipated that new documents will be produced for each use
   case dependent on support and demand.  Such documents will explain
   the use case and define the necessary protocol extensions.

5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for a PCE-based controller are little
   different from those for any other PCE system.  That is, the
   operation relies heavily on the use and security of PCEP and so
   consideration should be given to the security features discussed in
   [RFC5440] and the additional mechanisms described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pceps].

   It should be observed that the trust model of a network that operates
   without a control plane is different from one with a control plane.
   The conventional "chain of trust" used with a control plane is
   replaced by individual trust relationships between the controller and
   each individual NE.  This model may be considerably easier to manage
   and so is more likely to be operated with a high level of security.
   However, debate will rage over overall system security and the
   opportunity for attacks in an architecture with a central controller
   since the network can be vulnerable to denial of service attacks on
   the controller, and the forwarding system may be harmed by attacks on
   the messages sent to individual NEs.  In short, while the
   interactions with a PCE-based controller are not substantially
   different from those in any other SDN architecture, the security
   implications of SDN are still open for discussion.  The IRTF's SDN
   Research Group (SDNRG) continues to discuss this topic.

Internet-Draft             PCE-CC Architecture             December 2016


   It is expected that each new document that is produced for a specific
   use case will also include considerations of the security impacts of
   the use of a PCE-based central controller on the network type and
   services being managed.

6.  Manageability Considerations

   The architecture described in this document is a management
   architecture: the PCE-based controller is a management component that
   controls the network through a southbound management protocol (PCEP).

   RFC 5440 [RFC5440] contains a substantive manageability
   considerations section that examines how a PCE-based system and a
   PCE-enabled system may be managed.  A MIB module for PCEP was
   published as RFC 7420 [RFC7420] and a YANG module for PCEP has also
   been proposed [I-D.pkd-pce-pcep-yang].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests for IANA action.
