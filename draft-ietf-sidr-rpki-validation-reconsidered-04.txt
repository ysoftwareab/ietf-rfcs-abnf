1.  Introduction

   This document proposes an update to the certificate validation
   procedure specified in [RFC6487] that reduces aspects of operational
   fragility in the management of certificates in the RPKI, while
   retaining essential security features.

2.  Certificate Validation in the RPKI

   As currently defined in section 7.2 of [RFC6487], validation of PKIX
   certificates that conform to the RPKI profile relies on the use of a
   path validation process where each certificate in the validation path
   is required to meet the certificate validation criteria.

   These criteria require in particular that the resources on each
   certificate in the validation path are "encompassed" by the resources
   on the issuing certificate.  The first certificate in the path is
   required to be a trust anchor, and its resources are considered valid
   by definition.

Internet-Draft               RPKI Validation                   June 2016


   For example, in the following sequence:

     Certificate 1 (trust anchor):
       Issuer TA,
       Subject TA,
       Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24,
                 2001:db8::/32, AS64496-AS64500

     Certificate 2:
      Issuer TA,
      Subject CA1,
      Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 2001:db8::/32

     Certificate 3:
      Issuer CA1,
      Subject CA2,
      Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 2001:db8::/32

     ROA 1:
      Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate):
       Issuer CA2,
       Subject R1,
       Resources 192.0.2.0/24

       Prefix 192.0.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496

   All certificates in this scenario are considered valid in that the
   resources on each certificate are encompassed by the issuing
   certificate.  ROA1 is valid because the specified prefix is
   encompassed by the embedded EE certificate, as required by [RFC6482].

3.  Operational Considerations

   The allocations recorded in the RPKI change as a result of resource
   transfers and some types of operational errors.  For example, the CAs
   involved in transfer might choose to modify CA certificates in an
   order that causes some of these certificates to "over-claim"
   temporarily.  It may also happen that a child CA does not voluntarily
   request a shrunk resource certificate when resources are being
   transferred or reclaimed by the parent.  Furthermore some types of
   operational errors that may occur during management of RPKI databases
   also may create CA certificates that, temporarily, no longer
   encompass all of the resources in subordinate certificates.

   Consider the following sequence:






Huston, et al.          Expires December 9, 2016                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               RPKI Validation                   June 2016


     Certificate 1 (trust anchor):
      Issuer TA,
      Subject TA,
      Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24,
                2001:db8::/32, AS64496-AS64500

     Certificate 2:
      Issuer TA,
      Subject CA1,
      Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 2001:db8::/32

     Certificate 3 (invalid):
      Issuer CA1,
      Subject CA2,
      Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 2001:db8::/32

     ROA 1 (invalid):
      Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate):
       Issuer CA2,
       Subject R1,
       Resources 192.0.2.0/24

       Prefix 192.0.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496

   Here Certificate 2 from the previous example was re-issued by TA to
   CA1 and the prefix 198.51.100.0/24 was removed.  However, CA1 failed
   to re-issue a new Certificate 3 to CA2.  As a result Certificate 3 is
   now over-claiming and considered invalid, and by recursion the
   embedded Certificate 4 used for ROA1 is also invalid.  And ROA1 is
   invalid because the specified prefix is no longer encompassed by a
   valid embedded EE certificate, as required by [RFC6482]

   However, it should be noted that ROA1 does not make use of any of the
   address resources that were removed from CA1's certificate, and thus
   it would be desirable if ROA1 could still be viewed as valid.
   Technically CA1 could re-issue a Certificate 3 to CA2 without
   198.51.100.0/24, and then ROA1 would be considered valid according to
   [RFC6482].  But as long as CA1 does not take this action, ROA1
   remains invalid.  It would be preferable if ROA1 could be considered
   valid.

4.  An Amended RPKI Certification Validation Process

4.1.  Verified Resource Set

   The problem described above can be considered as a low probability
   problem today.  However the potential impact on routing security
   would be high if an overclaim occurred near the apex of the RPKI



Huston, et al.          Expires December 9, 2016                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               RPKI Validation                   June 2016


   hierarchy and would invalidate the entirety of the sub-tree located
   below this point.

   The changes proposed here to the validation procedure in [RFC6487] do
   not change the probability of this problem, but limit the impact to
   just the overclaimed resources.  This approach is intended to avoid
   causing CA certificates to be treated as completely invalid as a
   result of overclaims.  However, these changes are designed to not
   degrade the security offered by the RPKI.  Specifically, no ROAs or
   router certificates will be treated as valid if they contain only
   resources that are not encompassed by all superior certificates along
   a path to a trust anchor.

   The way this is achieved conceptually is by maintaining a set of
   verified resources for each certificate that is separate from the set
   of resources found in the [RFC3779] resource extension on a
   certificate.

4.2.  Changes to existing standards

4.2.1.  Resource Certificate Path Validation

   Step 6 of the Resource Certification Path Validation defined in
   section 7.2 of [RFC6487] currently has the following on the
   validation of resources contained in the [RFC3779] resource extension
   of certificates:

   o  The resource extension data is "encompassed" by the resource
      extension data contained in a valid certificate where this issuer
      is the subject (the previous certificate in the context of the
      ordered sequence defined by the certification path).

   The following is an amended specification to be used in place of this
   text.

   o  The Relying Party MUST keep a Verified Resource Set for the
      certificate independent of the RFC3779 extension itself, that is
      built up using the following approach:

      *  If the certificate under test is chosen as a Trust Anchor, then
         the Verified Resource Set of this certificate is equal to the
         RFC3779 resource extensions.

      *  If the certificate under test not chosen as a Trust Anchor, the
         Verified Resource Set is found by comparing this certificate to
         its parent certificate (the previous certificate in the context
         of the ordered sequence defined by the certification path) in
         the following way:



Huston, et al.          Expires December 9, 2016                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               RPKI Validation                   June 2016


         +  For any of the resource extensions that use the "inherit"
            element as described in sections 2.2.3.5 and 3.2.3.3 of RFC
            3779, the corresponding resources of this type should be
            taken from the parent certificate.

         +  For resource extensions that do no use the "inherit"
            element, the intersection of the resources on this
            certificate and the Verified Resource Set of the parent
            certificate MUST be used.  If any resources on this
            certificate are not encompassed by the Verified Resource Set
            of the parent certificate, a warning SHOULD be issued to
            help operators rectify this situation.

         +  If the Verified Resource Set obtained this way is empty for
            all resource classes (IPv4, IPv6 and AS), then the
            certificate MUST be considered invalid.

4.2.2.  ROA Validation

   Section 4 of [RFC6482] currently has the following text on the
   validation of resources on a ROA:

   o  The IP address delegation extension [RFC3779] is present in the
      end-entity (EE) certificate (contained within the ROA), and each
      IP address prefix(es) in the ROA is contained within the set of IP
      addresses specified by the EE certificate's IP address delegation
      extension.

   The following is an amended specification to be used in place of this
   text.

   o  The Verified Resource Set of the end-entity (EE) certificate
      (contained within the ROA), contains each IP address prefix(es) in
      the ROA.

4.2.3.  BGPsec Router Certificate Validation

   BGPsec Router Certificate Validation is defined in section 3.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles].  Path validation defined section
   7 of [RFC6487] is used as the first step in validation, and a number
   of additional constraints are applied.

   We propose that the text of the following two additions:

   o  BGPsec Router Certificates MUST NOT include the IP Resource
      extension.

Internet-Draft               RPKI Validation                   June 2016


   o  BGPsec Router Certificates MUST include the AS Resource Identifier
      Delegation extension.

   Is updated to the following:

   o  The Validated Resource Set of BGPsec Router Certificates MUST NOT
      include IP Resources.

   o  BGPsec Router Certificates MUST include the AS Resource Identifier
      Delegation extension and all AS resources included on this MUST be
      encompassed by the Validated Resource Set of the BGPsec Router
      Certificates.

4.3.  An example

   Consider the following example under the amended approach:

     Certificate 1 (trust anchor):
      Issuer TA,
      Subject TA,
      Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24,
                2001:db8::/32, AS64496-AS64500

       Verified Resource Set: 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24,
                              2001:db8::/32, AS64496-AS64500
       Warnings: none

     Certificate 2:
      Issuer TA,
      Subject CA1,
      Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 2001:db8::/32, AS64496

       Verified Resource Set: 192.0.2.0/24,
                              2001:db8::/32, AS64496
       Warnings: none

     Certificate 3:
      Issuer CA1,
      Subject CA2,
      Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, AS64496

       Verified Resource Set: 192.0.2.0/24, AS64496
       Warnings: overclaim for 198.51.100.0/24

     ROA 1 (valid):
      Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate):
       Issuer CA2,
       Subject R1,



Huston, et al.          Expires December 9, 2016                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               RPKI Validation                   June 2016


       Resources 192.0.2.0/24

        Verified resources: 192.0.2.0/24
        Warnings: none

        Prefix 192.0.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496

       ROA1 is considered valid because the prefix matches the Verified
       Resource Set on the embedded EE certificate, as required by
       RFC 6482.

     ROA 2 (invalid):
      Embedded Certificate 5 (EE certificate):
       Issuer CA2,
       Subject R2,
       Resources 198.51.100.0/24

        Verified resources: none
        Warnings: overclaim for 198.51.100.0/24

        Prefix 198.51.100.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496

       ROA2 is considered invalid because the prefix does not match the
       Verified Resource Set on the embedded EE certificate. The amended
       approach therefore cannot lead to ROAs showing up as valid for
       resources that are not verified on the full path from the Trust
       Anchor down to the ROA.

     BGPSec Certificate 1 (valid):
      Issuer CA2
      Subject ROUTER-64496
      Resources AS64496

       Verified resources: AS64496
       Warnings: none

     BGPSec Certificate 2 (invalid):
      Issuer CA2
      Subject ALL-ROUTERS
      Resources AS64496-AS64497

       Verified resources: AS64496
       Warnings: overclaim for AS64497

       BGPSec Certificate 2 is considered invalid because not ALL
       resources are part of the Verified Resource Set of this
       certificate. This problem can be mitigated by issuing separate
       certificates for each AS number.
