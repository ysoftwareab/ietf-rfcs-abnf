Introduction</h3>

<p> The Shim6 protocol  <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-shim6-proto'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;shim6&#8209;proto]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nordmark, E. and M. Bagnulo, &ldquo;Shim6: Level 3 Multihoming Shim Protocol for IPv6,&rdquo; Feb&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> has been
	designed 
	to add multihoming capabilities
	to IPv6, while avoiding the drawbacks of current IPv4 multihoming
	practice (prefix announcements in BGP), and giving more
	control to the end host (through locator selection).
      
</p>
<p> Together with the Shim6 protocol, the working group has
	designed a failure detection mechanism, called REAP 
	<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-shim6-failure-detection'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;shim6&#8209;failure&#8209;detection]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J. and I. van Beijnum, &ldquo;Failure Detection and Locator Pair Exploration Protocol for  	    IPv6 Multihoming,&rdquo; Jun&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, that allows hosts to
	detect and recover from failures, thanks to a combination of 
	traffic monitoring and active probing.
</p>
<p> Implementing such new protocols is crucial to allow tracking 
	errors or
	weaknesses in the overall design, as well as evaluating
	protocol behaviour in the real world. We developped  
	an implementation of Shim6 and REAP, available from
	<a href='http://inl.info.ucl.ac.be/LinShim6'>http://inl.info.ucl.ac.be/LinShim6</a>. 
	LinShim6 has been used to evaluate the performance of REAP 
	path exploration 
      	<a class='info' href='#BARRE07'>[BARRE07]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Barr√©, S. and O. Bonaventure, &ldquo;Improved Path Exploration in shim6-based Multihoming,&rdquo; Aug&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p> This draft is aimed at describing the challenges of a proper 
	integration of Shim6 in a protocol stack while preserving its 
	efficiency. 
	LinShim6 supports
	the base Shim6 protocol
	(negotiation and address rewriting) as well as failure detection
	and recovery (REAP). To our knowledge LinShim6 is also the first 
	publicly available implementation that supports both the HBA
	and CGA mechanisms for securing the locator set exchange
	(the CGA/HBA code is derived mostly from the 
	<a href='http://www.docomolabs-usa.com/lab_opensource.html'>DoCoMo SEND project</a>). 
</p>
<p>In this draft, we present a detailed report of the supported
	parts of the protocol, in terms of the terminology defined in
	section 2 of 	<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-shim6-proto'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;shim6&#8209;proto]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nordmark, E. and M. Bagnulo, &ldquo;Shim6: Level 3 Multihoming Shim Protocol for IPv6,&rdquo; Feb&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. 
	Some non critical features for the current application of LinShim6
	have not been implemented yet. 
	They will be added as soon as a need for them arises. 
	For instance, the Forked Instance Identifier is only useful if 
	a socket API is implemented (such as the API defined in 
	<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-shim6-multihome-shim-api'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;shim6&#8209;multihome&#8209;shim&#8209;api]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Komu, M., Bagnulo, M., Slavov, K., and S. Sugimoto, &ldquo;Socket Application Program Interface (API) for Multihoming  	    Shim,&rdquo; Nov&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>). 
	The Locator Preference Option may only be used if the corresponding 
	tuning capability is provided, either by the user or by an automated 
	technique. 
</p>
<p>Other features will be supported in a future version of the 
	implementation. These are detailed in <a class='info' href='#sec.features'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Protocol conformance by feature</span><span>)</span></a>.

General architecture</h3>

<p>The LinShim6 implementation is composed of two parts. First, a kernel
	patch adds 
	support for shim6 negotiation trigger, 
	address rewriting and failure detection. Second, a daemon is responsible
	for the management of the Shim6 control plane (negotiation, 
	path exploration). The kernel communicates with the user space 
	daemon through the Netlink interface
	<a class='info' href='#RFC3549'>[RFC3549]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Salim, J., Khosravi, H.,  Kleen, A., and A.  Kuznetsov, &ldquo;Linux Netlink as an IP Services Protocol,&rdquo; Jul&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>. 
</p>
<p>Hereafter we briefly describe the kernel and user level part
	of LinShim6. A more extensive description can be found in 
	<a class='info' href='#BARRE07b'>[BARRE07b]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Barr√©, S. and O. Bonaventure, &ldquo;Implementing SHIM6 using the Linux XFRM framework,&rdquo; Dec&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>
	or <a class='info' href='#BARRE08'>[BARRE08]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Barr√©, S., &ldquo;LinShim6 - Implementation of the Shim6 protocol,&rdquo; Feb&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Kernel patch</h3>

<p>The default negotiation trigger makes use of the NF_IP6_LOCAL_IN and 
	  NF_IP6_LOCAL_OUT netfilter hooks to listen to the packets 
	  travelling through the networking stack. A Shim6 negotiation is 
	  triggered by default when either 2 KB of data have been seen
	  for a given 
	  address pair or the flow exists for one minute. Those values
	  have been chosen through observation of netflow traces,
	  showing that more than 80% of the observed traffic last
	  less than 1 minute, and also 80% is less than 2 KB in size.
	  This default heuristic thus appeared as a reasonable
	  discriminator to avoid starting a Shim6 negotiation when it
	  is not needed. 
	  In some cases (e.g. heavily loaded servers), one may want
	  to never trigger a Shim6 context establishment, except if it
	  is explicitly requested by the peer. This is possible by
	  simply not loading the heuristic module. One can also define
	  its own heuristic, by designing a customized module.
	
</p>
<p>Address rewriting is implemented as an extension to the XFRM
	  framework, originally designed for IPsec <a class='info' href='#KANDA04'>[KANDA04]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kanda, M., Miyazawa, K., and H. Esaki, &ldquo;USAGI IPv6 IPsec development for Linux,&rdquo; Jan&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>.
	  The XFRM framework allows for dynamically adding a new sublayer in
	  the Networking stack for some flows, according to a policy. Examples 
	  of already defined sublayers are the AH sublayer 
	  (Authentication Header) or the ESP sublayer (Encapsulating Security 
	  Payload). Similarly, we define a new sublayer for Shim6. The policies 
	  responsible for
	  directing packets to this new module are communicated from the daemon
	  to the kernel through Netlink, when a change in the locators is 
	  needed or a new Shim6 context is created. For outgoing packets, the
	  policy takes the form of a matching rule with the ULIDs
	  (Upper Layer IDentifiers, defined in 
	  <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-shim6-proto'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;shim6&#8209;proto]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nordmark, E. and M. Bagnulo, &ldquo;Shim6: Level 3 Multihoming Shim Protocol for IPv6,&rdquo; Feb&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>). 
	  For incoming 
	  packets that do not have the Shim6 extension header, the same kind of
	  matching rule is used. We also defined a matching rule based on the 
	  context tag, in order to be able to demultiplex tagged incoming 
	  packets.
	
</p>
<p>Failure detection is performed inside the kernel for efficiency 
	  reasons: a timer must be started or stopped for each incoming or
	  outgoing packet. We maintain REAP failure detection
	  timers inside the XFRM states, so that the daemon is
	  notified (through Netlink) when a keepalive must be sent or
	  an exploration is to be started.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
LinShim6 daemon</h3>

<p>The daemon continuously listens to three types 
	  of 
	  events. First, Shim6 and REAP control messages are received through 
	  a raw socket.
	  Second, Netlink messages provide information from the kernel, for 
	  example whether a context must be created, a keepalive must be sent 
	  or 
	  an exploration must be started. Finally, messages can be received 
	  through a pipe where the other threads may write commands. Four
	  threads are currently defined:
	  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Main thread: Maintains all the critical states.

HBA/CGA support</h3>

<p>The user is able to set HBA and CGA parameters thanks to
	    a configuration file. A tool (cgatool), derived from the
	    DoCoMo SEND project, allows for manual generation of CGA
	    keys, CGA addresses and HBA addresses. Four types of
	    addresses can coexist in an end-system: unsecured, HBA,
	    CGA and
	    CGA-compatible HBA. It is up to the applications to decide
	    which address is used as ULID for a given communication. If
	    the application chooses the unspecified source address, then
	    the kernel applies RFC3484<a class='info' href='#RFC3484'>[RFC3484]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Draves, R., &ldquo;Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol 	  version 6 (IPv6),&rdquo; Feb&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> rules
	    to pick a suitable source address from the available set.
	    When performing the locator set exchange, LinShim6 decides
	    what locators to use in the local locator set based on the
	    ULID type:
	    </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Unsecured address: the local ULID is neither a CGA
	      nor an HBA. LinShim6 decides that the locator set is
	      made of only the ULID, because it would be impossible
	      for the peer to check the validity of the other
	      locators.
</li>
<li>HBA address: the local ULID is an HBA (not
	      CGA-compatible): LinShim6 sends all the addresses that are in
	      the same HBA set and are currently available in the
	      system. For example if an HBA set is configured to
	      gather four prefixes, but the host only receives Router
	      Advertisements for two of them, only the corresponding
	      two addresses are announced to the peer. If later other
	      addresses become reachable, they are announced through
	      an Update Request.
</li>
<li>CGA address: since a signature is used to
	      authenticate a locator set, any locator can be put in
	      the set. LinShim6 behaviour is then to advertise all
	      available locators in the system.
</li>
<li>CGA-compatible HBA address: LinShim6 also sends all
	      available locators to the peer. The only difference with
	      pure CGA addresses is that the subset of addresses
	      belonging to the same HBA set as the ULID are verified
	      with HBA rather than included in the signature, thus
	      leading to a faster verification process.

<a name="rfc.section.2.3"></a><h3>2.3.&nbsp;
Locator updates</h3>

<p>
	  During the lifetime of a Shim6 context, locators may appear
	  or disappear. If a new locator becomes available in the
	  system, 
	  all peers
	  are updated (except if the new address cannot be added to
	  some of the contexts, according to the rules described in
	  <a class='info' href='#sec.hbacga'>Section&nbsp;2.2.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>HBA/CGA support</span><span>)</span></a>). As required by 
	  <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-shim6-proto'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;shim6&#8209;proto]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nordmark, E. and M. Bagnulo, &ldquo;Shim6: Level 3 Multihoming Shim Protocol for IPv6,&rdquo; Feb&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, the new locator
	  starts being actually part of a Shim6 context only when the
	  new locator set has been aknowledged by the peer.
</p>
<p>
	  On the other hand, when a locator disappears, it is
	  immediately removed from all contexts and a locator update
	  is sent to the peer. It does not make sense to wait for the
	  acknowledgement in that case, since the locator is not
	  reachable anymore. Moreover, if the removed locator is
	  current for any context (that is, actually used for sending
	  packets), a REAP path exploration is triggered.

Context removal</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the previous section, a context is removed
	  upon reception of an XFRM event from the kernel, 
	  indicating that no traffic
	  has been seen for that context during 
	  at least 10 minutes. 
	  The daemon then 
	  cleans up all data related to the expired
	  context, both in the daemon and in the kernel. 
	  Shim6 kernel state is also cleaned everytime the daemon is 
	  started to avoid inconsistency.
</p>
<p>In the future, we will also check if no opened socked is
	  using the context before removing it. This will avoid the
	  current possibility that a context gets stalled, if it remains
	  idle during more than 10 minutes and then tries to send data again.

	terminology. Additionally, we define hereafter the keywords
	that are used to describe the level of support for the
	different features.
	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>YES: The feature is fully supported.
</li>
<li>
	    FEATURE NOT SUPPORTED: if a MUST is followed by 
	    "FEATURE NOT SUPPORTED",
	    this means that the MUST makes sense only if the feature
	    exists. That 
	    is, the implementation is still compliant 
	    but does not implement the
	    particular feature. Currently unsupported features are:
	    
<ul class="text">
<li> R1bis: this message is defined to allow the recovery
		of a context, when one endpoint has dropped the context while
		the other endpoint is still using it. When
		<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-shim6-proto'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;shim6&#8209;proto]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nordmark, E. and M. Bagnulo, &ldquo;Shim6: Level 3 Multihoming Shim Protocol for IPv6,&rdquo; Feb&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> specifies to send a R1bis
		message, we currently ignore the message supposed to
		trigger the sending of the R1bis.
</li>
<li> Error messages: used to inform the peer about what went
		wrong.
</li>
<li> IPsec: the design of LinShim6 is based on the XFRM
		architecture in the kernel. The same architecture is used by
		IPsec, thus a small adaptation (if any) of LinShim6 
		should allow it
		to work well together with IPsec. However, we have not yet
		tested such an interaction.
</li>
<li> FII (Forked Instance Identifier): the FII is defined in 
		<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-shim6-proto'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;shim6&#8209;proto]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nordmark, E. and M. Bagnulo, &ldquo;Shim6: Level 3 Multihoming Shim Protocol for IPv6,&rdquo; Feb&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> as a way to fork Shim6
		contexts, so that several contexts may share the same ULID
		pair, and are distinguished thanks to an integer called
		the FII. This has interest only if a socket API is
		implemented, so that applications may choose a context
		rather than another to send packets (which allows
		selecting a different set of locators). There is no short
		term plan to support this. 
</li>
<li> ULID pair option: it is defined to allow performing
		context negotiation with a locator pair that differs from
		the ULID pair. This may be useful for example if non
		routable ULIDs are used. There is no short term plan to
		support this, because non-routable ULIDs are not (yet ?)
		deployed in the current Internet.
</li>
</ul>	
	  
</li>
<li>
	    NO: Unsupported optional features are simply followed by NO.
	  
</li>
<li>
	    CONFIGURABLE: The feature is supported, but requires
	    manual configuration from the user for correct behaviour.
	  
</li>
<li>
	    PARTIAL SUPPORT: The feature is partially supported, that
	    is, the requirement in verified in some cases, but not

Conclusion and further work</h3>

<p>This draft describes the current state of the LinShim6
	implementation, version 0.9.
	It uses a heuristic to decide whether to trigger a Shim6 negotiation, 
	and it is able to monitor the state of the communication thanks to the 
	REAP state machine. It has been shown to successfully support the switch
	to an alternative locator pair, and it is the first known
	Shim6 implementation that supports HBA and CGA. 
	LinShim6 is still under development. We aim at 
	finally providing the complete set of features.
	In the near future we will work on context recovery and error
	messages. Other missing features seem to have
	a lower priority and are left for later.
      
</p>
<p> We have established an exhaustive listing of supported and
      unsupported elements of the protocols, which appears as making
      much easier to verify the level of support and security of the protocol.

<p>John Ronan reviewed this document and provided comments. He also spent
	many hours testing the code in many different scenarios, giving valuable
	feedback and helping in several tricky bug fixes. His help has been very
	invaluable to improve LinShim6 overall stability.
</p>
<p>Matthijs Mekking has written a wireshark patch for Shim6, that has been
	very helpful in testing the implementation, and also used LinShim6
	himself and provided feedback.
</p>
<p>The CGA/HBA support, cgad and cgatool benefitted from much
      code from the DoCoMo SEND implementaion, the clarity of the
      code made extension and adaptation for LinShim6 very
      effective.
</p>
<p>Francis Dupont has written the very first known
	implementation of HBA. Although we have written a second one based
	on DoCoMo SEND project, Francis Dupont's work, and especially his
	test suite, has been used to validate our HBA module.
