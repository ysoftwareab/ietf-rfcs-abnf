Abstract

   This document discusses methods available for LDAP server discovery
   and advertisement based on previous IETF and ongoing IETF work.

1. Introduction

   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [1] can be used to
   build "islands" of servers that are not a priori tied into a single
   Directory Information Tree (DIT.) Here, it is necessary to determine
   how a client can discover LDAP servers and how LDAP servers can
   discover each other's existence. This documents discusses the methods
   available based on current and previous IETF work.

2. Server Discovery of Other Servers

   An LDAP server discovers other LDAP servers by either using a
   proposed naming scheme and the DNS or by using an additional server

   to server indexing protocol.  Once a server discovers other servers
   it can collect information for returning LDAP v3 referrals (as LDAP
   URLs) to clients.

2.1. Discovery via DNS

   An LDAP server may either be registered using SRV records [2] or, if
   the server uses the "dc-naming" scheme ([3, 4]), it can attempt to
   find the server managing its parent node by using DNS to look for the
   LDAP server for the parent domain. Additionally, an LDAP server may
   be named using a common alias as described in [5].  In either case,
   it is necessary to include information about the root of the LDAP
   server's subtree by using DNS TXT records as discussed in [6].

   As an example, consider a server with the RDN "dc=foo,dc=bar,dc=com"
   (i.e. in domain foo.bar.com).  To find its parent server, it would
   first look for a SRV record for ldap.tcp.bar.com and then follow [5]
   by looking for ldap.bar.com.  If any of these records were found, it
   would then look for a TXT record for the same domain to determine the
   root of its parent server's sub-tree.

2.2. Discovery via the Common Indexing Protocol [7, 8]

   Independent of what DIT is being managed, LDAP servers could export
   index information about their portion of the tree via the Common
   Indexing Protocol.  This requires some a priori discovery and set up
   of the index mesh and the inclusion of the root DN of the server's
   portion of the tree in the exported index information.

3. Client Discovery of LDAP Servers

   To discover LDAP servers, clients should follow the sequence of steps
   specified in [9] (which uses DNS and the service location protocol)
   with the target service being LDAP.  If a DNS record is found for a
   name that begins with ldap (i.e. ldap.tcp.foo.com or ldap.foo.com) a
   further DNS lookup for a TXT record under that name would return the
   root of that server's subtree.   If a client supports DHCP, it may
   use the DHCP extension specified in [10] to locate LDAP servers.

   Alternatively, LDAP clients may have a list of preconfigured LDAP
   servers included with them that a user can select from.  Here, some
   of the servers in the preconfigured list might provide the
   functionality described in this document, to allow for simpler
   clients.

4. Security Considerations

   Since this draft only summarizes available methods, it adds no
   additional security considerations to those inherent in the
   referenced documents.  Implementors are strongly recommended to read
   and follow the security considerations provided in the referenced
   documents.
