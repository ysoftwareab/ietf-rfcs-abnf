Abstract

   This document proposes five new media types, text/xml,
   application/xml, text/xml-external-parsed-entity,
   application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd, for
   use in exchanging network entities which are conforming Extensible
   Markup Language (XML).  This document also proposes a convention for
   naming media subtypes outside of these five subtypes when those
   subtypes represent XML entities. XML MIME entities are currently
   exchanged via the HyperText Transfer Protocol on the World Wide Web,
   are an integral part of the WebDAV protocol for remote web
   authoring, and are expected to have utility in many domains.

Internet-Draft              XML Media Types                December 1999


1. Introduction

   The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)[20]  has issued Extensible
   Markup Language (XML), version 1[10]. To enable the exchange of XML
   network entities, this document proposes five new media types,
   text/xml, application/xml, text/xml-external-parsed-entity,
   application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd as
   well as a naming convention for identifying XML-based MIME media
   types.

   XML entities are currently exchanged on the World Wide Web, and XML
   is also used for property values and parameter marshalling by the
   WebDAV protocol for remote web authoring. Thus, there is a need for
   a media type to properly label the exchange of XML network entities.
   (Note that, as sometimes happens between two communities, both MIME
   and XML have defined the term entity, with different meanings.)

   Although XML is a subset of the Standard Generalized Markup Language
   (SGML) ISO 8879[1], and currently is assigned the media types
   text/sgml and application/sgml, there are several reasons why use of
   text/sgml or application/sgml to label XML is inappropriate. First,
   there exist many applications which can process XML, but which
   cannot process SGML, due to SGML's larger feature set. Second, SGML
   applications cannot always process XML entities, because XML uses
   features of recent technical corrigenda to SGML.  Third, the
   definition of text/sgml and application/sgml in RFC 1874[4] includes
   parameters for SGML bit combination transformation format (SGML-
   bctf), and SGML boot attribute (SGML-boot). Since XML does not use
   these parameters, it would be ambiguous if such parameters were
   given for an XML MIME entity.  For these reasons, the best approach
   for labeling XML network entities is to provide new media types for
   XML.

   Since XML is an integral part of the WebDAV Distributed Authoring
   Protocol, and since World Wide Web Consortium Recommendations have
   conventionally been assigned IETF tree media types, and since
   similar media types (HTML, SGML) have been assigned IETF tree media
   types, the XML media types also belong in the IETF media types tree.

   Similarly, XML will be used as a foundation for other media types,
   including types in every branch of the IETF media types tree. To
   facilitate the processing of such types, media types based on XML,
   but which are not identified using text/xml or application/xml,
   should be named using a suffix of -xml. This will allow XML-based
   tools - browsers, editors, search engines, and other processors - to
   work with all XML-based media types.

3. XML Media Types

   This document introduces five new media types for XML MIME entities,
   text/xml, application/xml, text/xml-external-parsed-entity,
   application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd.
   Registration information for these media types are described in the
   sections below.

   Within the XML specification, XML MIME entities can be classified
   into four types.  In the XML terminology, they are called "document
   entities", "external DTD subsets", "external parsed entities", and
   "external parameter entities".  The media types text/xml and
   application/xml can be used for "document entities", while "external
   parsed entities" require text/xml-external-parsed-entity or
   application/xml-external-parsed-entity.  For backward compatibility,
   application/xml and text/xml can also be used for "external parsed
   entities", "external DTD subsets", and "external parameter
   entities".  The media type application/xml-dtd can be used for
   "external DTD subsets" or "external parameter entities".  Neither
   external DTD subsets nor external parameter entities parse as XML
   documents, and while some XML document entities may be used as
   external parsed entities and vice versa, there are many cases where
   the two are not interchangeable. XML also has unparsed entities,
   internal parsed entities, and internal parameter entities, but they
   are not XML MIME entities.

   If an XML document is readable by casual users, text/xml is
   preferable to application/xml.  MIME user agents (and web user
   agents) that do not have explicit support for text/xml will treat it
   as text/plain, for example, by displaying the XML entity as plain
   text.  Application/xml is preferable when the XML MIME entity is
   unreadable by casual users.  Similarly,
   text/xml-external-parsed-entity is preferable when an external
   parsed entity  is readable by casual users, but
   application/xml-external-parsed-entity is preferable when a plain
   text display is inappropriate.

   The top-level media type "text" has some restrictions on MIME
   entities and they are described in RFC 2045[5] and RFC 2046[6].  In
   particular, UTF-16, UCS-4, and UTF-32 are not allowed (except for
   HTTP, which uses a MIME-like mechanism).  Thus, if an XML document
   or external parsed entity is encoded in such character encoding
   schemes, it cannot be labled as text/xml or
   text/xml-external-parsed-entity (except for HTTP).

   Text/xml and application/xml behave differently when the charset
   parameter is not explicitly specified.  If the default charset
   (i.e., US-ASCII) for text/xml is inconvenient for some reason (e.g.,
   bad WWW servers), application/xml provides an alternative (see

   "Optional parameters" of "3.2 Application/xml Registration").  The
   same rules apply to the distinction between
   text/xml-external-parsed-entity and
   application/xml-external-parsed-entity.

   XML provides a general framework for defining sequences of
   structured data.  In some cases, it may be desirable to define new
   media types which use XML but define a specific application of XML,
   perhaps due to domain-specific security considerations or runtime
   information.  This document does not prohibit future media types
   dedicated to such XML applications. However, developers of such
   media types are recommended to use this document as a basis.  In
   particular, the charset parameter should be used in the same manner.

3.1 Text/xml Registration

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: xml

   Mandatory parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset

   Although listed as an optional parameter, the use of the charset
   parameter is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED, since this information can be
   used by XML processors to determine authoritatively the character
   encoding of the XML MIME entity. The charset parameter can also be
   used to provide protocol-specific operations, such as charset-based
   content negotiation in HTTP.  "UTF-8" (see RFC 2279[9]) is the
   recommended value, representing the UTF-8 charset. UTF-8 is
   supported by all conforming processors of XML 1.0[10].

   If the XML MIME entity is transmitted via HTTP, which uses a
   MIME-like mechanism that is exempt from the restrictions on the text
   top- level type (see section 19.4.1 of RFC 2616[13])), "UTF-16"
   (Appendix C.3 of Unicode 3.0[14] and Amendment 1 of ISO/IEC
   10646[2]) is also recommended.  UTF-16 is supported by all
   conforming processors of XML 1.0[10] .  Since the handling of CR, LF
   and NUL for text types in most MIME applications would cause
   undesired transformations of individual octets in UTF-16 multi-octet
   characters, gateways from HTTP to these MIME applications MUST
   transform the XML MIME entity from a text/xml; charset="utf-16" to
   application/xml; charset="utf-16".

   Conformant with RFC 2046[6], if a text/xml entity is received with
   the charset parameter omitted, MIME processors and XML processors
   MUST use the default charset value of "us-ascii".  In cases where
   the XML MIME entity is transmitted via HTTP, the default charset


, et. al.                 Expires May 31, 2000                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              XML Media Types                December 1999


   value is still "us-ascii".  (Note:  There is an inconsistency
   between this specification and HTTP/1.1, which uses "ISO-8859-1" as
   the default for a historical reason.  Since XML is a new format, a
   new default should be chosen for better I18N.  "US-ASCII" was chosen
   as the intersection of "UTF-8" and "ISO-8859-1".)

   One reason that the charset parameter is authoritative is that some
   MIME processing engines do transcoding of MIME bodies of the
   top-level media type "text" without reference to any of the internal
   content.  Thus, it is possible that some agent might change a
   text/xml;charset=iso-2022-jp to text/xml;charset=UTF-8 without
   modifying the encoding declaration of an XML document.

   Since the charset parameter is authoritative, the charset is not
   always declared within an XML encoding declaration.  Thus, special
   care is needed when the recipient strips the MIME header and
   provides persistent storage of the received XML MIME entity (e.g.,
   in a file system). Unless the charset is UTF-8 or UTF-16, the
   recipient SHOULD also persistently store information about the
   charset, perhaps by embedding a correct XML encoding declaration
   within the XML MIME entity.

   Encoding considerations:

   This media type MAY be encoded as appropriate for the charset and
   the capabilities of the underlying MIME transport. For 7-bit
   transports, data in both UTF-8 and UTF-16 is encoded in quoted-
   printable or base64.  For 8-bit clean transport (e.g., 8BITMIME
   ESMTP or NNTP), UTF-8 is not encoded, but UTF-16 is base64 encoded.
   For binary clean transports (e.g., HTTP), no content-
   transfer-encoding is necessary.

   Security considerations:

   See section 4 below.

   Interoperability considerations:

   XML has proven to be interoperable across WebDAV clients and
   servers, and for import and export from multiple XML authoring tools.

   Published specification:

   XML is device-, platform-, and vendor-neutral and is supported by a
   wide range of Web user agents, WebDAV clients and servers, as well

   Although listed as an optional parameter, the use of the charset
   parameter is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED, since this information can be
   used by XML processors to determine authoritatively the charset of
   the XML MIME entity. The charset parameter can also be used to
   provide protocol-specific operations, such as charset-based content
   negotiation in HTTP.

   "UTF-8" (see RFC 2279[9]) and "UTF-16" (Appendix C.3 of Unicode
   3.0[14] and Amendment 1 of ISO/IEC 10646[2]) are the recommended
   values, representing the UTF-8 and UTF-16 charsets, respectively.
   These charsets are  preferred since they are supported by all
   conforming processors of XML 1.0[10].

   If an application/xml entity is received where the charset parameter
   is omitted, no information is being provided about the charset by
   the MIME Content-Type header. Conforming XML processors MUST follow
   the requirements in section 4.3.3 of XML 1.0[10] which directly
   address this contingency. However, MIME processors which are not XML
   processors should not assume a default charset if the charset
   parameter is omitted from an application/xml entity.

   Since the charset parameter is authoritative, the charset is not
   always declared within an XML encoding declaration.  Thus, special
   care is needed when the recipient strips the MIME header and
   provides persistent storage of the received XML MIME entity (e.g.,

   Encoding considerations:

   The encoding considerations of text/xml apply.

   Security considerations:

   See section 4 below.

   Interoperability considerations:

   XML external parsed entities are as interoperable as XML documents,
   though they have a less tightly constrained structure and must
   therefore be referenced by XML documents for proper handling by XML
   processors.  Similarly, XML documents cannot be reliably used as
   external parsed entities because external parsed entities are
   prohibited from using the standalone declaration in the XML
   declaration. Identifying XML external parsed entities with their own
   content type should enhance interoperability of both XML documents
   and XML external parsed entities.

   Since non-validating processors of XML 1.0 do not always read
   external parsed entities, interoperability is not guaranteed.

   Published specification:

   see XML 1.0[10]

   Applications which use this media type:

   Applications of text/xml or application/xml may use external parsed
   entities.

4. Security Considerations

   XML, as a subset of SGML, has the same security considerations as
   specified in RFC 1874[4].  [Editor's note: some applications of XML
   may open up new security considerations. This issue needs further
   consideration.]

   To paraphrase section 3 of RFC 1874[4], XML MIME entities contain
   information to be parsed and processed by the recipient's XML
   system. These entities may contain and such systems may permit
   explicit system level commands to be executed while processing the
   data.  To the extent that an XML system will execute arbitrary
   command strings, recipients of XML MIME entities may be at risk. In
   general, it may be possible to specify commands that perform
   unauthorized file operations or make changes to the display
   processor's environment that affect subsequent operations.

   Use of XML is expected to be varied, and widespread.  XML is under
   scrutiny by a wide range of communities for use as a common syntax
   for community-specific metadata.  For example, the Dublin Core group
   is using XML for document metadata, and a new effort has begun which
   is considering use of XML for medical information.  Other groups
   view XML as a mechanism for marshalling parameters for remote
   procedure calls.  More uses of XML will undoubtedly arise.

   Security considerations will vary by domain of use.  For example,
   XML medical records will have much more stringent privacy and
   security considerations than XML library metadata. Similarly, use of
   XML as a parameter marshalling syntax necessitates a case by case
   security review.

   XML may also have some of the same security concerns as plain text.
   Like plain text, XML can contain escape sequences which, when
   displayed, have the potential to change the display processor
   environment in ways that adversely affect subsequent operations.
   Possible effects include, but are not limited to, locking the
   keyboard, changing display parameters so subsequent displayed text
   is unreadable, or even changing display parameters to deliberately
   obscure or distort subsequent displayed material so that its meaning
   is lost or altered.  Display processors should either filter such
   material from displayed text or else make sure to reset all
   important settings after a given display operation is complete.

   Some terminal devices have keys whose output, when pressed, can be
   changed by sending the display processor a character sequence. If
   this is possible the display of a text object containing such
   character sequences could reprogram keys to perform some illicit or
   dangerous action when the key is subsequently pressed by the user.
   In some cases not only can keys be programmed, they can be triggered

   remotely, making it possible for a text display operation to
   directly perform some unwanted action. As such, the ability to
   program keys should be blocked either by filtering or by disabling
   the ability to program keys entirely.

   Note that it is also possible to construct XML documents which make
   use of what XML terms "entity references" (using the XML meaning of
   the term "entity", which differs from the MIME definition of this
   term), to construct repeated expansions of text. Recursive
   expansions are prohibited by XML 1.0[10] and XML processors are
   required to detect them.  However, even non-recursive expansions may
   cause problems with the finite computing resources of computers, if
   they are performed many times.

5. The Byte Order Mark (BOM) and Conversions to/from UTF-16

   The XML Recommendation, in section 4.3.3, specifies that UTF-16 XML
   MIME entities must begin with a byte order mark (BOM), which is the
   ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE character, hexadecimal sequence 0xFEFF (or
   0xFFFE, depending on endian). The XML Recommendation further states
   that the BOM is an encoding signature, and is not part of either the
   markup or the character data of the XML document.

   Due to the BOM, applications which convert XML from the UTF-16
   encoding to another encoding SHOULD strip the BOM before conversion.
   Similarly, when converting from another encoding into UTF-16, the
   BOM SHOULD be added after conversion is complete.

6. A naming convention for XML-based media types

   This document proposes the use of a naming convention (a suffix of
   '-xml') for identifying XML-based MIME media types, whatever their
   particular contents may represent.  This allows the use of generic
   XML processors and technologies on a wide variety of different XML
   document types at a minimum cost, using existing frameworks for
   media type registration.  The use of a suffix convention is intended
   to avoid interference with the existing MIME type structures.

   As XML development continues to develop, new XML document types are
   appearing rapidly. Many of these XML document types would benefit
   from the identification possibilities of a more specific MIME media
   type than text/xml or application/xml can provide, and it is likely
   that many new media types for XML-based document types will be
   registered in the near and ongoing future.

   While the benefits of specific MIME types for particular types of
   XML documents are significant, all XML documents share common
   structures and syntax that make possible common processing.

   Some areas where 'generic' processing is useful include:

   o  Browsing - An XML browser can display any XML document with a
      provided CSS[12] or XSLT[19] style sheet, whatever the vocabulary
      of that document.

   o  Editing - Any XML editor can read, modify, and save any XML
      document.

   o  Fragment identification - XPointers[16] can work with any XML
      document, whatever vocabulary it uses and whether or not it uses
      XPointer for its own fragment identification. [Editor's note: the
      use of non-XPointer fragment identifiers by XML vocabularies like
      SVG and SMIL requires further discussion.]

   o  Hypertext Linking - XLink[17] hypertext linking is designed to
      connect any XML documents, regardless of vocabulary.

   o  Searching - Search engines, agents, and XML-oriented query tools
      should be able to read XML documents and extract the content and
      names of elements and attributes even if they are ignorant of the
      particular vocabulary used for elements and attributes.

   o  Storage - XML-oriented storage systems, which keep XML documents
      internally in a parsed form, should similarly be able to process,
      store, and recreate any XML document.

   When a new media type is introduced for an XML-based format, the


, et. al.                 Expires May 31, 2000                 [Page 19]

Internet-Draft              XML Media Types                December 1999


   name of the media type should end with "-xml".  This convention will
   allow applications that can process XML generically to detect that
   the MIME entity is supposed to be an XML document, verify this
   assumption by invoking some XML processor, and then process the XML
   document accordingly.  Applications may match for types that
   represent XML entities by comparing the subtype to the pattern
   */*-xml.

   XML-generic processing is not always appropriate for XML-based media
   types.  For example, some such media types may require fragment
   identifiers different from XPointer.  By *not* following the naming
   convention */*-xml, such media types can avoid XML-generic
   processing.

   The registration process for these media types is described in RFC
   2048[7].  The registrar for the IETF tree will enforce this rule for
   all XML-based media types created in the IETF tree.  Registrars for
   other trees should follow this convention in order to ensure maximum
   interoperability of their XML-based documents.  Similarly, media
   subtypes that do not represent XML MIME entities should not be
   allowed to register with a -xml suffix.

   The suffix approach allows XML document types to be identified
   within any subtree.  The vendor subtree, for example, is likely to
   include a large number of XML-based document types.  By using a
   suffix, rather than setting up a separate subtree, those types may
   remain in the same location in the tree of MIME types that they
   would have occupied had they not been based on XML.

   The optional charset parameter may be used with media types
   following these conventions as described in this document for
   text/xml and application/xml.  If an XML-based media type is under
   the text top-level type, the charset parameter is authoritative and
   the default value is "US-ASCII".  If an XML-based media type is
   under other top-level types, the charset parameter is authoritative
   and there are no default values.  MIME processors which are not XML
   processors should not assume a default charset, while conforming XML
   processors MUST follow the requirements in section 4.3.3 of XML
   1.0[10].  The use of the charset parameter is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED,
   since this information can be used by XML processors to determine
   authoritatively the charset of the XML MIME entity.

7. Examples

   The examples below give the value of the Content-type MIME header
   and the XML declaration (which includes the encoding declaration)
   inside the XML MIME entity.  For UTF-16 examples, the Byte Order
   Mark character is denoted as "{BOM}", and the XML declaration is
   assumed to come at the beginning of the XML MIME entity, immediately
   following the BOM. Note that other MIME headers may be present, and
   the XML MIME entity may contain other data in addition to the XML
   declaration; the examples focus on the Content-type header and the
   encoding declaration for clarity.

7.1 text/xml with UTF-8 Charset

   Content-type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

   This is the recommended charset value for use with text/xml.  Since
   the charset parameter is provided, MIME and XML processors must
   treat the enclosed entity as UTF-8 encoded.

   If sent using a 7-bit transport (e.g. SMTP), the XML entity must use
   a content-transfer-encoding of either quoted-printable or base64.
   For an 8-bit clean transport (e.g., 8BITMIME ESMTP or NNTP), or a
   binary clean transport (e.g., HTTP) no content-transfer-encoding is
   necessary.

7.2 text/xml with UTF-16 Charset

   Content-type: text/xml; charset="utf-16"

   {BOM}<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-16'?>

   This is possible only when the XML MIME entity is transmitted via
   HTTP, which uses a MIME-like mechanism and is a binary-clean
   protocol, hence does not perform CR and LF transformations and
   allows NUL octets. This differs from typical text MIME type
   processing (see section 19.4.1 of RFC 2616[13]) for details).

   Since HTTP is binary clean, no content-transfer-encoding is
   necessary.

7.3 text/xml with ISO-2022-KR Charset

   Content-type: text/xml; charset="iso-2022-kr"

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding='iso-2022-kr'?>

   This example shows text/xml with a Korean charset (e.g., Hangul)
   encoded following the specification in RFC 1557[3].  Since the
   charset parameter is provided, MIME and XML processors must treat
   the enclosed entity as encoded per RFC 1557[3].

   Since ISO-2022-KR has been defined to use only 7 bits of data, no
   content-transfer-encoding is necessary with any transport.

7.4 text/xml with Omitted Charset

   Content-type: text/xml

   {BOM}<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>

   This example shows text/xml with the charset parameter omitted.  In
   this case, MIME and XML processors must assume the charset is
   "us-ascii", the default charset value for text media types specified
   in RFC 2046[6]. The default of "us-ascii" holds even if the text/xml
   entity is transported using HTTP.

   Omitting the charset parameter is NOT RECOMMENDED for text/xml. For
   example, even if the contents of the XML MIME entity are UTF-16 or
   UTF-8, or the XML MIME entity has an explicit encoding declaration,
   XML and MIME processors must assume the charset is "us-ascii".

7.5 application/xml with UTF-16 Charset

   Content-type: application/xml; charset="utf-16"

   {BOM}<?xml version="1.0"?>

   This is a recommended charset value for use with application/xml.
   Since the charset parameter is provided, MIME and XML processors
   must treat the enclosed entity as UTF-16 encoded.

   If sent using a 7-bit transport (e.g., SMTP), the XML MIME entity
   must be encoded in quoted-printable or base64. For a binary clean
   transport (e.g., HTTP) or an 8-bit clean transport (e.g., 8BITMIME
   ESMTP or NNTP), no content-transfer-encoding is necessary.

7.6 application/xml with ISO-2022-KR Charset

   Content-type: application/xml; charset="iso-2022-kr"

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-2022-kr"?>

   This example shows application/xml with a Korean charset (e.g.,
   Hangul) encoded following the specification in RFC 1557[3]. Since
   the charset parameter is provided, MIME and XML processors must

Internet-Draft              XML Media Types                December 1999


   treat the enclosed entity as encoded per RFC 1557[3], independent of
   whether the XML MIME entity has an internal encoding declaration
   (this example does show such a declaration, which agrees with the
   charset parameter).

   Since ISO-2022-KR has been defined to use only 7 bits of data, no
   content-transfer-encoding is necessary with any transport.

7.7 application/xml with Omitted Charset and UTF-16 XML MIME entity

   Content-type: application/xml

   {BOM}<?xml version='1.0'?>

   For this example, the XML MIME entity begins with a BOM.  Since the
   charset has been omitted, a conforming XML processor follows the
   requirements of XML 1.0[10], section 4.3.3. Specifically, the XML
   processor reads the BOM, and thus knows deterministically that the
   charset encoding is UTF-16.

   An XML-unaware MIME processor should make no assumptions about the
   charset of the XML MIME entity.

7.8 application/xml with Omitted Charset and UTF-8 Entity

   Content-type: application/xml

   <?xml version='1.0'?>

   In this example, the charset parameter has been omitted, and there
   is no BOM. Since there is no BOM, the XML processor follows the
   requirements in section 4.3.3, and optionally applies the mechanism
   described in appendix F (which is non-normative) of XML 1.0[10] to
   determine the charset encoding of UTF-8. The XML entity does not
   contain an encoding declaration, but since the encoding is UTF-8,
   this is still a conforming XML MIME entity.

   An XML-unaware MIME processor should make no assumptions about the
   charset of the XML MIME entity.

7.9 application/xml with Omitted Charset and Internal Encoding
    Declaration

   Content-type: application/xml

   <?xml version='1.0' encoding="ISO-10646-UCS-4"?>

   In this example, the charset parameter has been omitted, and there
   is no BOM.  However, the XML MIME entity does have an encoding

   declaration inside the XML MIME entity which specifies the entity's
   charset. Following the requirements in section 4.3.3, and optionally
   applying the mechanism described in appendix F (non-normative) of
   XML 1.0[10], the </section> XML processor determines the charset
   encoding of the XML MIME entity (in this example, UCS-4).

   An XML-unaware MIME processor should make no assumptions about the
   charset of the XML MIME entity.

7.10 text/xml-external-parsed-entity with UTF-8 Charset

   Content-type: text/xml-external-parsed-entity; charset="utf-8"

   <?xml encoding="utf-8"?>

   This is the recommended charset value for use with
   text/xml-external-parsed-entity.  Since the charset parameter is
   provided, MIME and XML processors must treat the enclosed entity as
   UTF-8 encoded.

   If sent using a 7-bit transport (e.g. SMTP), the XML entity must use
   a content-transfer-encoding of either quoted-printable or base64.
   For an 8-bit clean transport (e.g., 8BITMIME ESMTP or NNTP), or a
   binary clean transport (e.g., HTTP) no content-transfer-encoding is
   necessary.

7.11 application/xml-external-parsed-entity with UTF-16 Charset

   Content-type: application/xml-external-parsed-entity;
   charset="utf-16"

   {BOM}<?xml?>

   This is a recommended charset value for use with
   application/xml-external-parsed-entity.  Since the charset parameter
   is provided, MIME and XML processors must treat the enclosed entity
   as UTF-16 encoded.

   If sent using a 7-bit transport (e.g., SMTP) or an 8-bit clean
   transport (e.g., 8BITMIME ESMTP or NNTP), the XML MIME entity must
   be encoded in quoted-printable or base64. For a binary clean
   transport (e.g., HTTP), no content-transfer-encoding is necessary.

7.12 application/xml-dtd

   Content-type: application/xml-dtd; charset="utf-8"

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

   Charset "utf-8" is a recommended charset value for use with
   application/xml-dtd.  Since the charset parameter is provided, MIME
   and XML processors must treat the enclosed entity as UTF-8 encoded.

7.13 application/mathml-xml

   Content-type: application/mathml-xml

   <?xml version="1.0" ?>

   MathML documents are XML documents whose content describes
   mathematical information, as described by MathML 1.01[15]. As a
   format based on XML, MathML documents should use the -xml suffix
   convention in their MIME content-type identifier.

7.14 application/XSLT-xml

   Content-type: application/XSLT-xml

   <?xml version="1.0" ?>

   Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSLT) documents are XML documents
   whose content describes stylesheets for other XML documents, as
   described by XSLT[19]. As a format based on XML, XSLT documents
   should use the -xml suffix convention in their MIME content-type
   identifier.

7.15 application/rdf-xml

   Content-type: application/rdf-xml

   <?xml version="1.0" ?>

   RDF documents identified using this MIME type are XML documents
   whose content describes mathematical information, as described by
   RDF[11]. RDF documents that use a format based on XML should use the
   -xml suffix convention in their MIME content-type identifier.

   Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) documents are XML documents whose
   content describes graphical information, as described by SVG[18]. As
