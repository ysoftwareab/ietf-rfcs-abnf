Abstract

   The current four bit Internet Protocol (IP) Version field provides
   for such a limited number of versions that very tight control must be
   exercised on their allocation as documented in [RFC 2780].
   Provisions are specified whereby one value of that field is extended
   to provide more easily allocated values.

INTERNET-DRAFT            Extended IP Versions                April 2001


1. Introduction

   Since the begining of the Internet Protocol (IP), it has had a four
   bit version field.  This was entirely adequate in the early days when
   the Internet engineering community was tiny and went fairly rapdily
   through version 1, 2, and 3, before stabilizing on version 4 (IPv4)
   under which the Internet has prospered [RFC 791].

   A few years ago, when a need was felt for specification of a new
   version, the remaining version number space was barely adequate to
   assign versions to the main contenders, leading to the selection of
   IPv6 as the main path [RFC 2460].  Furthermore, the Internet
   engineering community has grown by over two orders of magnitude since
   the specification of IP, with IETF attendence going from 15 to 3000
   potentially increasing demand for experimental parameter values.

   To continue the successful tradition of simple free availability of
   parameter values, IP version numbers should be extended.  How
   beneficial this will be in this particular case is unclear.  But if
   the prospering of Internet Technology has taught us anything, it is
   that simple free availability of parameter values can lead to
   surprising creativity and vigor.  Perhaps this mechanism will do that
   or perhaps it will turn out to be little, like the DNS Class
   mechanism.  But the cost is small and the potential benefit hard to
   bound.

   An equivalent 4 bit IP version number can be allocated for any
   extended IP version, when warranted, under the IP version allocation
   procedure specified in [RFC 2780].



2. Extended IP Versions

   The Internet Protocol packet format is defined to begin with a four
   bit Version as follows:

    0
    0 1 2 3 4 5
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Version|  ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   To extend this versioning mechanism, this document specifies that the
   version number (TBD (suggest 1)) is followed by a twelve bit
   extention as shown below.

INTERNET-DRAFT            Extended IP Versions                April 2001


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | (TBD) |   x   |        y      | ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The version number is considered an unsigned integer equal to x*256 +
   y.  This produces version numbers in the range 0 to 4095 but the
   first sixteen values, 0 through 15, are reserved for future
   definition and to avoid conflict with non-extended version numbers.
   This structure causes the remainder of the IP packet to be 16 bit
   aligned.



3. IANA Considerations

   IP Version number nibble value (TBD (suggest 1)) is allocated for
   extended IP Versions as documnted herein.

   Extended IP versions 0 through 15 are reserved and required a
   "Standards Action" as defined in RFC 2434 for allocation.

   Extended IP version 16 through 4095 are to be allocated in sequential
   order based on "Specification Required" as defined in RFC 2434.



4. Security Considerations

   Firwalls or other software which wishes to pass only packets they
   understand should block all packets with extended IP versions.
