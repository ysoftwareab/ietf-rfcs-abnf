                     EVPN Virtual Ethernet Segment 
              draft-ietf-bess-evpn-virtual-eth-segment-02 

Abstract

   EVPN and PBB-EVPN introduce a family of solutions for multipoint
   Ethernet services over MPLS/IP network with many advanced
   capabilities among which their multi-homing capabilities. These
   solutions define two types of multi-homing for an Ethernet Segment
   (ES): 1) Single-Active and 2) All-Active, where an Ethernet Segment
   is defined as a set of links between the multi-homed device/network
   and the set of PE devices that they are connected to.    

   Some Service Providers want to extend the concept of the physical
   links in an ES to Ethernet Virtual Circuits (EVCs) where many of such
   EVCs can be aggregated on a single physical External Network-to-
   Network Interface (ENNI). An ES that consists of a set of EVCs
   instead of physical links is referred to as a virtual ES (vES). This
   draft describes the requirements and the extensions needed to support
   vES in EVPN and PBB-EVPN.

INTERNET DRAFT          Virtual Ethernet Segment        January 08, 2019


1. Introduction

   [RFC7432] and [RFC7623] introduce a family of solutions for
   multipoint Ethernet services over MPLS/IP network with many advanced
   capabilities among which their multi-homing capabilities. These
   solutions define two types of multi-homing for an Ethernet Segment
   (ES): 1) Single-Active and 2) All-Active, where an Ethernet Segment
   is defined as a set of links between the multi-homed device/network
   and the set of PE devices that they are connected to.    

   This document extends the Ethernet Segment concept so that an ES can
   be associated to a set of EVCs (e.g., VLANs) or other objects such as
   MPLS Label Switch Paths (LSPs) or Pseudowires (PWs).

1.1  Virtual Ethernet Segments in Access Ethernet Networks

   Some Service Providers (SPs) want to extend the concept of the
   physical links in an ES to Ethernet Virtual Circuits (EVCs) where
   many of such EVCs (e.g., VLANs) can be aggregated on a single
   physical External Network-to-Network Interface (ENNI). An ES that
   consists of a set of EVCs instead of physical links is referred to as
   a virtual ES (vES). Figure below depicts two PE devices (PE1 and PE2)
   each with an ENNI where a number of vES's are aggregated on - each of
   which through its associated EVC.

   E-NNIs are commonly used to reach off-network / out-of-franchise
   customer sites via independent Ethernet access networks or third-
   party Ethernet Access Providers (EAP) (see above figure). E-NNIs can
   aggregate traffic from hundreds to thousands of vES's; where, each
   vES is represented by its associated EVC on that ENNI. As a result,
   ENNIs and their associated EVCs are a key element of SP off-networks
   that are carefully designed and closely monitored.

   In order to meet customer's Service Level Agreements (SLA), SPs build
   redundancy via multiple E-PEs / ENNIs (as shown in figure above)
   where a given vES can be multi-homed to two or more PE devices (on
   two or more ENNIs) via their associated EVCs. Just like physical ES's
   in [RFC7432] and [RFC7623] solutions, these vES's can be single-homed
   or multi-homed ES's and when multi-homed, then can operate in either
   Single-Active or All-Active redundancy modes. In a typical SP off-
   network scenario, an ENNI can be associated with several thousands of
   single-homed vES's, several hundreds of Single-Active vES's and it
   may also be associated with tens or hundreds of All-Active vES's.

   Other Service Providers (SPs) want to extend the concept of the
   physical links in an ES to individual Pseudowires (PWs) or to MPLS
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) per [EVPN-VPWS] in Access MPLS networks.
   Figure 2 illustrates this concept.

   In some cases, Service Providers use Access MPLS Networks that belong
   to separate administrative entities or third parties as a way to get
   access to the their own IP/MPLS network infrastructure. This is the
   case illustrated in Figure 2.

   In such scenarios, a virtual ES (vES) is defined as a set of
   individual PWs if they cannot be aggregated into a common LSP. If the
   aggregation of PWs is possible, the vES can be associated to an LSP
   in a given PE. In the example of Figure 2, EVC3 is connected to a
   VPWS instance in AG2 that is connected to PE1 and PE2 via PW3 and PW5
   respectively. EVC4 is connected to a separate VPWS instance on AG2

   that gets connected to an EVI on PE1 and PE2 via PW4 and PW6,
   respectively. Since the PWs for the two VPWS instances can be
   aggregated into the same LSPs going to the EVPN network, a common
   virtual ES can be defined for LSP1 and LSP2. This vES will be shared
   by two separate EVIs in the EVPN network.

   In some cases, this aggregation of PWs into common LSPs may not be
   possible. For instance, if PW3 were terminated into a third PE, e.g.
   PE3, instead of PE1, the vES would need to be defined on a per
   individual PW on each PE, i.e. PW3 and PW5 would belong to ES-1,
   whereas PW4 and PW6 would be associated to ES-2.

   For MPLS/IP access networks where a vES represents a set of PWs or
   LSPs, this document extended Single-Active multi-homing procedures of
   [RFC7432] and [7623] to vES. The vES extension to All-Active multi-
   homing is outside of the scope of this document for MPLS/IP access
   networks.  

   This draft describes requirements and the extensions needed to
   support vES in [RFC7432] and [RFC7623]. Section 3 lists the set of
   requirements for virtual ES's. Section 4 describes the solution for
   [RFC7432] and [RFC7623] to meet these requirements. Section 5
   describes the failure handling and recovery for Virtual ES's in
   [RFC7432] and [RFC7623]. Section 6 covers scalability and fast
   convergence required for Virtual ES's in [RFC7432] and [RFC7623].

   Single-Active Redundancy Mode (SA): When only a single PE, among a
   group of PEs attached to an Ethernet-Segment, is allowed to forward
   traffic to/from that Ethernet Segment, then the Ethernet segment is
   defined to be operating in Single-Active redundancy mode.

   All-Active Redundancy Mode (AA): When all PEs attached to an Ethernet
   segment are allowed to forward traffic to/from that Ethernet-Segment,
   then the Ethernet segment is defined to be operating in All-Active
   redundancy mode.


3. Requirements

   This section describes the requirements specific to virtual Ethernet
   Segment (vES) for (PBB-)EVPN solutions. These requirements are in
   addition to the ones described in [EVPN-REQ], [RFC7432], and
   [RFC7623].

3.1. Single-Homed & Multi-Homed Virtual Ethernet Segments

   A PE needs to support the following types of vES's:

   (R1a) A PE MUST handle single-homed vES's on a single physical port
   (e.g., single ENNI)

   (R1b) A PE MUST handle a mix of Single-Homed vES's and Single-Active
   multi-homed vES's simultaneously on a single physical port (e.g.,
   single ENNI). Single-Active multi-homed vES's will be simply referred
   to as Single-Active vES's through the rest of this document. 

   (R1c) A PE MAY handle All-Active multi-homed vES's on a single
   physical port. All-Active multi-homed vES's will be simply referred
   to as All-Active vES's through the rest of this document. 

   (R1d) A PE MAY handle a mixed of All-Active vES's along with other
   types of vES's on a single physical port

   (R1e) A Multi-Homed vES (Single-Active or All-Active) can be spread
   across any two or more PEs  (on two or more ENNIs) 


3.2. Scalability

   A single physical port (e.g., ENNI) can be associated with many
   vES's. The following requirements give a quantitative measure for
   each vES type.

   (R2a) A PE SHOULD handle very large number of Single-Homed vES's on a
 


Sajassi et al.           Expires July 08, 2019                  [Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT          Virtual Ethernet Segment        January 08, 2019


   single physical port (e.g., thousands of vES's on a single ENNI)

   (R2b) A PE SHOULD handle large number of Single-Active vES's on a
   single physical port (e.g., hundreds of vES's on a single ENNI)

   (R2c) A PE MAY handle large number of All-Active Multi-Homed vES's on
   a single physical port (e.g., hundreds of vES's on a single ENNI)

   (R2d) A PE SHOULD handle the above scale for a mix of Single-homed
   vES's and Single-Active vES's simultaneously on a single physical
   port (e.g., single ENNI)

   (R4e) A PE MAY handle the above sale for a mixed of All-Active Multi-
   Homed vES's along with other types of vES's on a single physical port

3.3. Local Switching 

   Many vES's of different types can be aggregated on a single physical
   port on a PE device and some of these vES can belong to the same
   service instance (or customer). This translates into the need for
   supporting local switching among the vES's of the same service
   instance on the same physical port (e.g., ENNI) of the PE.

   (R3a) A PE MUST support local switching among different vES's
   belonging to the same service instance (or customer) on a single
   physical port. For example, in the above Figure 1,  PE1 MUST support
   local switching between CE11 and CE12 (both belonging to customer A)
   that are mapped to two Single-homed vES's on ENNI1.

   In case of Single-Active vES's, the local switching is performed
   among active EVCs belonging to the same service instance on the same
   ENNI.   

3.4. EVC Service Types

   A physical port (e.g., ENNI) of a PE can aggregate many EVCs each of
   which is associated with a vES. Furthermore, an EVC may carry one or
   more VLANs. Typically, an EVC carries a single VLAN and thus it is
   associated with a single broadcast domain. However, there is no
   restriction on an EVC to carry more than one VLANs. 

   (R4a) An EVC can be associated with a single broadcast domain - e.g.,
   VLAN-based service or VLAN bundle service

   (R4b) An EVC MAY be associated with several broadcast domains - e.g.,
   VLAN-aware bundle service 

   In the same way, a PE can aggregated many LSPs and PWs. In the case

   of individual PWs per vES, typically a PW is associated with a single
   broadcast domain, but there is no restriction on the PW to carry more
   than one VLAN if the PW is defined as vc-type VLAN.

   (R4c) A PW can be associated with a single broadcast domain - e.g.,
   VLAN-based service or VLAN bundle service.

   (R4b) An PW MAY be associated with several broadcast domains - e.g.,
   VLAN-aware bundle service."

3.5. Designated Forwarder (DF) Election

   Section 8.5 of [RFC7432] describes the default procedure for DF
   election in EVPN which is also used in [RFC7623]. This default DF
   election procedure is performed at the granularity of <ESI, EVI>. In
   case of a vES, the same EVPN default procedure for DF election also
   applies; however, at the granularity of <vESI, EVI>; where vESI is
   the virtual Ethernet Segment Identifier. As in [RFC7432], this
   default procedure for DF election at the granularity of <vESI, EVI>
   is also referred to as "service carving"; where, EVI is represented
   by an I-SID in PBB-EVPN and by a EVI service-id/vpn-id in EVPN.  With
   service carving, it is possible to evenly distribute the DFs for
   different vES's among different PEs, thus distributing the traffic
   among different PEs. The following list the requirements apply to DF
   election of vES's for EVPN.

   (R5a) A vES with m EVCs can be distributed among n ENNIs belonging to
   p PEs in any arbitrary oder; where n >= P >= m. For example, if there
   is an vES with 2 EVCs and there are 5 ENNIs on 5 PEs (PE1 through
   PE5), then vES can be dual-homed to PE2 and PE4 and the DF election
   must be performed between PE2 and PE4.

   (R5b) Each vES MUST be identified by its own virtual ESI (vESI)


3.6. OAM

   In order to detect the failure of individual EVC and perform DF
   election for its associated vES as the result of this failure, each
   EVC should be monitored independently. 

   (R6a) Each EVC SHOULD be monitored for its health independently

   (R6b) A single EVC failure (among many aggregated on a single
   physical port/ENNI) MUST trigger DF election for its associated vES.

3.7. Failure & Recovery

INTERNET DRAFT          Virtual Ethernet Segment        January 08, 2019


   (R7a) Failure and failure recovery of an EVC for a Single-homed vES
   SHALL NOT impact any other EVCs for its own service instance or any
   other service instances. In other words, for PBB-EVPN, it SHALL NOT
   trigger any MAC flushing both within its own I-SID as well as other
   I-SIDs. 

   (R7b) In case of All-Active Multi-Homed vES, failure and failure
   recovery of an EVC for that vES SHALL NOT impact any other EVCs for
   its own service instance or any other service instances. In other
   words, for PBB-EVPN, it SHALL NOT trigger any MAC flushing both
   within its own I-SID as well as other I-SIDs. 

   (R7c) Failure & failure recovery of an EVC for a Single-Active vES
   SHALL only impact its own service instance. In other words, for PBB-
   EVPN, MAC flushing SHALL be limited to the associated I-SID only and
   SHALL NOT impact any other I-SIDs.   

   (R7d) Failure & failure recovery of an EVC for a Single-Active vES
   MAY only impact C-MACs associated with MHD/MHNs for that service
   instance. In other words, MAC flushing SHOULD be limited to single
   service instance (I-SID in the case of PBB-EVPN) and only CMACs for
   Single-Active MHD/MHNs.

3.8. Fast Convergence

   Since large number of EVCs (and their associated vES's) are
   aggregated via a single physical port (e.g., ENNI), then the failure
   of that physical port impacts large number of vES's and triggers
   large number of ES route withdrawals. Formulating, sending,
   receiving, and processing such large number of BGP messages can
   introduce delay in DF election and convergence time. As such, it is
   highly desirable to have a mass-withdraw mechanism similar to the one
   in the [RFC7432] for withdrawing large number of Ethernet A-D routes.

   (R8a) There SHOULD be a mechanism equivalent to EVPN mass-withdraw
   such that upon an ENNI failure, only a single BGP message is needed
   to indicate to the remote PEs to trigger DF election for all impacted
   vES associated with that ENNI. 


4. Solution Overview

   The solutions described in [RFC7432] and [RFC7623] are leveraged as
   is with one simple modification and that is the ESI assignment is
   performed for a group of EVCs or LSPs/PWs instead of a group of
   links. In other words, the ESI is associated with a virtual ES (vES)
   and that's why it will be referred to as vESI.

INTERNET DRAFT          Virtual Ethernet Segment        January 08, 2019


   For EVPN solution, everything basically remains the same except for
   the handling of physical port failure where many vES's can be
   impacted. Section 5.1 and 5.3 below describe the handling of physical
   port/link failure for EVPN. In a typical multi-homed operation, MAC
   addresses are learned behind a vES are advertised with the ESI
   corresponding to the vES (i.e., vESI). EVPN aliasing and mass-
   withdraw operations are performed with respect to vES. In other
   words, the Ethernet A-D routes for these operations are advertised
   with vESI instead of ESI. 

   For PBB-EVPN solution, the main change is with respect to the BMAC
   address assignment which is performed similar to what is described in
   section 7.2.1.1 of [RFC7623] with the following refinements:

   - One shared BMAC address is used per PE for the single-homed vES's.
   In other words, a single BMAC is shared for all single-homed vES's on
   that PE.

   - One shared BMAC address should be used per PE per physical port
   (e.g., ENNI) for the Single-Active vES's. In other words, a single
   BMAC is shared for all Single-Active vES's that shared the same ENNI.

   - One shared BMAC address can be used for all Single-Active vES's on
   that PE.

   - One BMAC address is used per EVC per physical port per PE for each
   All-Active multi-homed vES.  In other words, a single BMAC address is
   used per vES for All-Active multi-homing scenarios.

   - A single BMAC address may also be used per vES per PE for Single-
   Active  multi-homing scenarios.

4.1. EVPN DF Election for vES

   The procedure for service carving for virtual Ethernet Segments is
   the same as the one outlined in section 8.5 of [RFC7432] except for
   the fact that ES is replaced with vES. For the sake of clarity and
   completeness, this procedure is repeated below: 

   1. When a PE discovers the vESI or is configured with the vESI
   associated with its attached vES, it advertises an Ethernet Segment
   route with the associated ES-Import extended community attribute. 

   2. The PE then starts a timer (default value = 3 seconds) to allow
   the reception of Ethernet Segment routes from other PE nodes
   connected to the same vES. This timer value MUST be same across all
   PEs connected to the same vES.

   3. When the timer expires, each PE builds an ordered list of the IP
   addresses of all the PE nodes connected to the vES (including
   itself), in increasing numeric value. Each IP address in this list is
   extracted from the "Originator Router's IP address" field of the
   advertised Ethernet Segment route. Every PE is then given an ordinal
   indicating its position in the ordered list, starting with 0 as the
   ordinal for the PE with the numerically lowest IP address. The
   ordinals are used to determine which PE node will be the DF for a
   given EVPN instance on the vES using the following rule: Assuming a
   redundancy group of N PE nodes, the PE with ordinal i is the DF for
   an EVPN instance with an associated EVI ID value of V when (V mod N)
   = i.
 


Sajassi et al.           Expires July 08, 2019                 [Page 13]

INTERNET DRAFT          Virtual Ethernet Segment        January 08, 2019


   It should be noted that using "Originator Router's IP address" field
   in the Ethernet Segment route to get the PE IP address needed for the
   ordered list, allows for a CE to be multi-homed across different ASes
   if such need ever arises. 

   4. The PE that is elected as a DF for a given EVPN instance will
   unblock traffic for that EVPN instance. Note that the DF PE unblocks
   all traffic in both ingress and egress directions for Single-Active
   vES and unblocks multi-destination in egress direction for All-Active
   Multi-homed vES. All non-DF PEs block all traffic in both ingress and
   egress directions for Single-Active vES and block multi-destination
   traffic in the egress direction for All-Active multi-homed vES. 

   In the case of an EVC failure, the affected PE withdraws its Ethernet
   Segment route. This will re-trigger the service carving procedures on
   all the PEs in the RG. For PE node failure, or upon PE commissioning
   or decommissioning, the PEs re-trigger the service carving across all
   affected vES's. In case of a Single-Active multi-homing, when a
   service moves from one PE in the Redundancy Group to another PE as a
   result of re-carving, the PE, which ends up being the elected DF for
   the service, SHOULD trigger a MAC address flush notification towards
   the associated vES. This can be done, for e.g. using IEEE 802.1ak
   MVRP 'new' declaration.

   For LSP and PW based vES, the non-DF PE SHOULD signal PW-status
   'standby' signaling to the AG PE, and the new DF MAY send an LDP MAC
   withdraw message as a MAC address flush notification. It should be
   noted that the PW-status is signaled for the scenarios where there is
   a one-to-one mapping between EVI and the PW.    

5. Failure Handling & Recovery

   There are a number of failure scenarios to consider such as:

   A: CE Uplink Port Failure
   B: Ethernet Access Network Failure
   C: PE Access-facing Port or link Failure
   D: PE Node Failure
   E: PE isolation from IP/MPLS network

   [RFC7432] and [RFC7623] solutions provide protection against such
   failures as described in the corresponding references.  In the
   presence of virtual Ethernet Segments (vES's) in these solutions,
   besides the above failure scenarios, there is one more scenario to
   consider and that is EVC failure. This implies that individual EVCs
   need to be monitored and upon their failure detection, appropriate DF
   election procedures and failure recovery mechanism need to be
   executed.

   [ETH-OAM] is used for monitoring EVCs and upon failure detection of a
   given EVC, DF election procedure per section [4.1] is executed. For
   PBB-EVPN, some addition extensions are needed to failure handling and
   recovery procedures of [RFC7623] in order to meet the above
   requirements. These extensions are describe in the next section.  

   [MPLS-OAM] and [PW-OAM] are used for monitoring the status of LSPs
   and/or PWs associated to vES.

5.1. Failure Handling for Single-Active vES in EVPN

   When a PE connected to a Single-Active multi-homed Ethernet Segment
   loses connectivity to the segment, due to link or port failure, it
   signals the remote PE to flush all CMAC addresses associated with
   that Ethernet Segment. This is done by advertising a mass-withdraw
   message using Ethernet A-D per-ES route. To be precise, there is no
   MAC flush per-se if there is only one backup PE for a given ES -
   i.e., only an update of the forwarding entries per backup-path
   procedure in [RFC 7432].

   In case of an EVC failure that impacts a single vES, the exact same
   EVPN procedure is used. In this case, the message using Ethernet A-D
   per ES route carries the vESI representing the vES which is in turn
   associated with the failed EVC. The remote PEs upon receiving this
   message perform the same procedures outlined in section 8.2 of
   [RFC7432].

5.2. EVC Failure Handling for Single-Active vES in PBB-EVPN

   When a PE connected to a Single-Active multi-homed Ethernet Segment
   loses connectivity to the segment, due to link or port failure, it
   signals the remote PE to flush all CMAC addresses associated with
   that Ethernet Segment. This is done by advertising a BMAC route along
   with MAC Mobility Extended community.

   In case of an EVC failure that impacts a single vES, if the above
   PBB-EVPN procedure is used, it results in excessive CMAC flushing
   because a single physical port can support large number of EVCs (and
   their associated vES's) and thus advertising a BMAC corresponding to
   the physical port with MAC mobility Extended community will result in
   flushing CMAC addresses not just for the impacted EVC but for all
   other EVCs on that port.

   In order to reduce the scope of CMAC flushing to only the impacted
   service instances (the service instance(s) impacted by the EVC
   failure), the BGP flush message is sent along with a list of impacted
   I-SID(s) represented by the new EVPN I-SID Extended Community as
   defined in section 6.  Since typically an EVC maps to a single
   broadcast domain and thus a single service instance, the list only
   contains a single I-SID. However, if the failed EVC carries multiple
   VLANs each with its own broadcast domain, then the list contains
   several I-SIDs - one for each broadcast domain. This new BGP flush
   message basically instructs the remote PE to perform flushing for
   CMACs corresponding to the advertised BMAC only across the advertised
   list of I-ISIDs (which is typically one).

   The above BMAC route that is advertised with the MAC Mobility
   Extended Community, can either represent the MAC address of the
   physical port that the failed EVC is associated with, or it can
   represent the MAC address of the PE. In the latter case, this is the
   dedicated MAC address used for all Single-Active vES's on that PE.
   The former one performs better than the latter one in terms of
   reducing the scope of flushing as described below and thus it is the
   recommended approach.       

   Advertising the BMAC route that represent the physical port (e.g.,
   ENNI) on which the failed EVC reside along with MAC Mobility and I-
   SID extended communities provide the most optimum mechanism for CMAC
   flushing upon EVC failure in PBB-EVPN for Single-Active vES because:

   1) Only CMAC addresses for the impacted service instances are
   flushed.

   2)  Only a subset of CMAC addresses for the impacted service
   instances are flushed - only the ones that are learned over the BMAC
 


Sajassi et al.           Expires July 08, 2019                 [Page 16]

INTERNET DRAFT          Virtual Ethernet Segment        January 08, 2019


   associated with the failed EVC. In other words, only a small fraction
   of the CMACs for the impacted service instance(s) are flushed.


5.3. Port Failure Handling for Single-Active vES's in EVPN

   When a large number of EVCs are aggregated via a single physical port
   on a PE; where each EVC corresponds to a vES, then the port failure
   impacts all the associated EVCs and their corresponding vES's. If the
   number of EVCs corresponding to the Single-Active vES's for that
   physical port is in thousands, then thousands of service instances
   are impacted. Therefore, the BGP flush message need to be inclusive
   of all these impacted service instances. In order to achieve this,
   the following extensions are added to the baseline EVPN mechanism:

   1) A PE when advertises an Ether-AD per ES route for a given vES, it
   colors it with the MAC address of the physical port which is
   associated with that vES. The receiving PEs take note of this color
   and create a list of vES's for this color.

   2) Upon a port failure (e.g., ENNI failure), the PE advertise a
   special mass-withdraw message with the MAC address of the failed port
   (i.e., the color of the port) encoded in the ESI field. For this
   encoding, type 3 ESI is used with the MAC field set to the MAC
   address of the port and the 3-octet local discriminator field set to
   0xFFFFFF. This mass-withdraw route is advertised with a list of Route
   Targets corresponding to the impacted service instances. If the
   number of Route Targets is more than they can fit into a single
   attribute, then a set of Ethernet A-D per ES routes are advertised.
   The remote PEs upon receiving this message, realize that this is a
   special mass-withdraw message and they access the list of the vES's
   for the specified color. Next, they initiate mass-withdraw procedure
   for each of the vES's in the list. 


5.4. Port Failure Handling for Single-Active vES's in PBB-EVPN

   When a large number of EVCs are aggregated via a single physical port
   on a PE; where each EVC corresponds to a vES, then the port failure
   impacts all the associated EVCs and their corresponding vES's. If the
   number of EVCs corresponding to the Single-Active vES's for that
   physical port is in thousands, then thousands of service instances
   (I-SIDs) are impacted. Therefore, the BGP flush message need to be
   sent with a list of thousands of I-SIDs. The new I-SID Extended
   Community provides a way to encode upto 24 I-SIDs in each Extended
   Community if the impacted I-SIDs are sequential (the base I-SID value
   plus the next 23 I-SID values). So, the packing efficiency can range
   from 1 to 24 and there can be up to 400 such Extended Community sent
 


Sajassi et al.           Expires July 08, 2019                 [Page 17]

INTERNET DRAFT          Virtual Ethernet Segment        January 08, 2019


   along with a BGP flush message for a total of 400 to 9600 I-SIDs. If
   the number of I-SIDs is large enough to not fit in a single
   Attribute, then either a number of BGP flush messages (with different
   RDs) can be transmitted or a single BGP flush message without the I-
   SID list can be transmitted. If the BGP flush message is transmitted
   without the I-SID list, then it instructs the receiving PEs to flush
   CMACs associated with that BMAC across all I-SIDs. For simplicity, we
   opt for the latter option in this document. In other words, if the
   number of impacted I-SIDs exceed that of a single BGP flush message,
   then the flush message is sent without the I-SID list. 

   As also described in [RFC7623], there are two ways to signal flush
   message upon a physical port failure:

   1) If the MAC address of the physical port is used for PBB
   encapsulation as BMAC SA, then upon the port failure, the PE MUST use
   the EVPN MAC route withdrawal message to signal the flush

   2) If the PE shared MAC address is used for PBB encapsulation as BMAC
   SA, then upon the port failure, the PE MUST re-advertise this MAC
   route with the MAC Mobility Extended Community to signal the flush

   The first method is recommended because it reduces the scope of
   flushing the most. 


5.5. Fast Convergence in PBB-EVPN

   As described above, when a large number of EVCs are aggregated via a
   physical port on a PE; where each EVC corresponds to a vES, then the
   port failure impacts all the associated EVCs and their corresponding
   vES's. Two actions must be taken as the result of such port failure:

   - Flushing of all CMACs associated with the BMAC of the failed port
   for the impacted I-SIDs

   - DF election for all impacted vES's associated with the failed port


   Section 5.4 describes how to flush CMAC address in the most optimum
   way - e.g., to flush least number of CMAC addresses for the impacted
   I-SIDs. This section describes how to perform DF election in the most
   optimum way - e.g., to trigger DF election for all impacted vES's
   (which can be in thousands) among the participating PEs via a single
   BGP message as opposed to sending thousands of BGP messages - one per
   vES.

   In order to devise such fast convergence mechanism that can be
 


Sajassi et al.           Expires July 08, 2019                 [Page 18]

INTERNET DRAFT          Virtual Ethernet Segment        January 08, 2019


   triggered via a single BGP message, all vES's associated with a given
   physical port (e.g., ENNI) are colored with the same color
   representing that physical port. The MAC address of the physical port
   is used for this coloring purposes and when the PE advertises an ES
   route for a vES associated with that physical port, it advertises it
   with an EVPN MAC Extended Community indicating the color of that
   port.

   The receiving PEs take note of this color and for each such color,
   they create a list of vES's associated with this color (with this MAC
   address). Now, when a port failure occurs, the impacted PE needs to
   notify the other PEs of this color so that these PEs can identify all
   the impacted vES's associated with that color (from the above list)
   and re-execute DF election procedures for all the impacted vES's. 

   In PBB-EVPN, there are two ways to convey this color to other PEs
   upon a port failure - one corresponding to each method for signaling
   flush message as described in section 5.4. If for PBB encapsulation,
   the MAC address of the physical port is used as BMAC SA, then upon
   the port failure, the PE sends MAC withdrawal message with the MAC
   address of the failed port as the color. However, if for PBB
   encapsulation, the shared MAC address of the PE (dedicated for all
   Single-Active vES's) is used as BMAC SA, then upon the port failure,
   the PE re-advertises the MAC route (that carries the shared BMAC)

   Figure 5: Fast Convergence Upon ENNI Failure

   The following describes the procedure for coloring vES's and fast
   convergence using this color in more details: 

   1- When a vES is configured, the PE colors the vES with the MAC
   address of the corresponding physical port and advertises the
   Ethernet Segment route for this vES with this color. 

   2- All other PEs (in the redundancy group) take note of this color
   and add the vES to the list for this color.

   3- Upon the occurrence of a port failure (e.g., an ENNI failure), the
   PE sends the flush message in one of the two ways described above
   indicating this color.  

   4- On reception of the flush message, other PEs use this info to
   flush their impacted CMACs and to initiate DF election procedures
   across all their affected vES's. 

   5- The PE with the physical port failure (ENNI failure), also send ES
   route withdrawal for every impacted vES's. The other PEs upon
   receiving these messages, clear up their BGP tables. It should be
   noted the ES route withdrawal messages are not used for executing DF
   election procedures by the receiving PEs. 


6. BGP Encoding

   This document defines one new BGP Extended Community for EVPN.

6.1. I-SID Extended Community

   A new EVPN BGP Extended Community called I-SID is introduced. This
   new extended community is a transitive extended community with the
   Type field of 0x06 (EVPN) and the Sub-Type of 0x07. 

   The I-SID Extended Community is encoded as an 8-octet value as
   follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Type=0x06     | Sub-Type=0x03 |        Base I-SID             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |    Cont.      |            Bit Map (24 bits)                  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 


      Figure 6: I-SID Extended Community

   This extended community is used to indicate the list of I-SIDs
   associated with a given Ethernet Segment.  

   24-bit map represents the next 24 I-SID after the base I-SID. For
   example based I-SID of 10025 with 24-bit map of zero means, only a
   single I-SID of 10025. I-SID of 10025 with bit map of 0x000001 means
   there are two I-SIDs, 10025 and 10026.

   The authors would like to thanks Mei Zhang and Jose Liste for their
   reviews and feedbacks of this document.  

8. Security Considerations

   All the security considerations in [RFC7432] and [RFC7623] apply
   directly to this document because this document leverages the control
   and data plane procedures described in those documents.

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations
   beyond that of [RFC7432] and [RFC7623] because advertisements and
   processing of Ethernet Segment route for vES in this document follows
   that of physical ES in those RFCs. 


9. IANA Considerations

   IANA has allocated sub-type value 7 in the "EVPN Extended Community
   Sub-Types" registry defined in "https://www.iana.org/assignments/bgp-
   extended-communities/bgp-extended-communities.xhtml#evpn" as follows:

   SUB-TYPE   NAME           Reference
   ----   --------------   -------------
   0x07   I-SID Ext Comm   [draft-sajassi-bess-evpn-virtual-eth-segment]

   It is requested from IANA to update the reference to this document.
