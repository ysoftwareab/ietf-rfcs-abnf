Abstract

    The IETF is an international group that conducts most of its
    business using electronic mail however three times a year it
    conducts an open meeting for one week. For the most part the actual
    mechanics of the meeting are organised by the IETF secretariat but
    there are some requirements placed on the local host.

    This document attempts to provide some guidelines for organisations
    that wish to volunteer to act as host for one of these open
    meetings. As the IETF growth pattern mirrors the Internet itself
    this document expresses sizes as a percentage of the expected
    attendance rather than use fixed numbers as we expect these numbers
    to change for each meeting. At the last meeting, in Munich Germany,
    there were just over 1300 attendees.


Travel

    The IETF is an international organisation so it is expected that
    meetings will be held in various parts of the globe and that it
    will be necessary to travel to "remote" locations. In order for this
    not to become too onerous but to allow meetings to be held in many
    different countries it is suggested that the site must be located
    within an hour's travel of a major airport which must have direct
    (non commuter) connections to the major international (gateway)
    airports of that country. Ideally this would mean that the host city
    could be reached with at most 2 aircraft transfers for most
    attendees.


Accommodation

    The host city must have sufficient hotels within walking distance
    (maximum 10 minutes) of the meeting site to accommodate everyone
    that wishes to attend the meeting. At the present time this means
    providing block booking for the peak night of approximately 60% of
    the expected attendance (remembering that not everyone attends for
    the whole week). It is desirable that the hotels be of, at least,
    superior standard with at least one offering rates within the
    current US government employee per diem limit and be members of an
    international chain of hotels (to aid booking of rooms from
    overseas). Information should also be provided on inexpensive hotels
    that are within walking distance of the meeting site, to accomodate
    attendees on a more strict budget. It is also desirable that the
    hotels be located close by to other amenities, including a range of
    restaurants with a variety of cuisines (including vegetarian
    dishes). There should be a variety of means of reaching the hotel
    from the airport in addition to rental cars, such as taxis, airport
    shuttles and public transport.


Meetings Site

    The IETF is made up of a large number of working groups the majority
    of which will wish to meet during the week, possibly more than once.
    It is therefore a requirement that the meetings site be capable of
    supporting at least 7 simultaneous meetings with meeting rooms
    varying in sizes. The specific requirements are as follows:
        Sunday
                1 x 10%         1000-1800
                1 x 30%         1500-1700
                1 x 80%         1700-2000

        Monday - Friday
                1 "foyer area" for registration
                2 x 5%          0900-2200
                2 x 10%         0900-2200
                2 x 15%         0900-2200
                2 x 20%         0900-2200
                2 x 25%         0900-2200
                1 x small meeting room (hollow square) 0700-0900

        Thursday
                1 x 80%         1500-1900       plenary hall

    In addition an office is required (board room style) from Saturday
    until Friday for secretariat use.

    Two of the larger rooms must be capable of supporting the broadcast
    of proceeding to the Internet. It is preferred that the meeting site
    be located within one of the hotels but if this is not possible it
    must be located within 5 minutes walk of the hotels and it must have
    access for people with disabilities.


Terminal Room

    One component of the meeting that must be provided by the local
    host is the "terminal room". This room must be located at the
    meeting site and is in addition to the meetings rooms. It should
    be designed to provide attendees with easy access from the host
    location to the Internet. The terminal room is expected to be
    available from noon Sunday through noon Friday. To accommodate those
    attendees who arrive on Saturday (due to air fare savings, jet lag
    recover, etc) it would be desirable to have it operational from
    Saturday afternoon or evening if possible. The room itself will need
    to be available for computer/network setup on the Friday preceeding
    the meeting and should be at least 250 square metres (approx 2500
    square feet). An additional room is also required for storage.

    X window displays (or Windows based PCs) (5%) and Ethernet drops
    (7.5%) should be provided, with a small number of localtalk runs. In
    addition 3 high performance laser printers are required with one
    dedicated to transparencies.

    It would be very desirable to provide a "small" number of dialin
    lines to the terminal room so that attendees at hotels remote from
    the meeting site can readily access the facilities in the terminal
    room.


MBONE

    Recent IETF meetings have been broadcast over the Internet,
    normally two simultaneous sessions. To broadcast a meeting you
    need a connection to the MBONE (Multicast Backbone) over at least
    an E1/T1 link. As the MBONE is still experimental you will require
    a MBONE router to connect to the MBONE, this may be a
    SPARCstation, or other multicast capable workstation as long as it
    supports pruning, or a cisco router (supporting PIM).

    To broadcast a session you will need a multicast capable
    workstation with a frame grabber as well as video & audio mixing
    equipment suitable for interworking with the sites audio/video
    facility. This facility should be configured so that remote
    participants can contribute to the discussion as well as just
    watch proceedings.

    It is also desirable that sessions be recorded and rebroadcast
    during the night to allow people in other time zones and
    opportunity to watch the session, even if they cannot participate.


Social Event

    Although optional, traditionally the host site has also been
    responsible for arranging a social event for at least 10-20% of the
    participants, that is held on one evening early in the week. The
    actual scope and content of the event is up to the local host, the
    Secretariat can provide advice on the appropriateness of the event
    but cannot be directly involved.
