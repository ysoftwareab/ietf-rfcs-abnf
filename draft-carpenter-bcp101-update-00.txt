Internet-Draft                BCP101 Update                  August 2005


1.  Introduction

   BCP 101 [1] assumed that the vehicle for certain IETF-related IPR
   would be the Internet Society (ISOC).  Since that time, an IETF Trust
   has been created to hold such IPR.  This document appropriately
   updates BCP 101.

   [Note to be removed by the RFC Editor: This draft refers to the IETF
   Trust as already existing, although it had not been formally created
   at the time of writing.  It is intended that this draft will be
   submitted for approval and publication shortly after the Trust is
   created.]

   Terms and abbreviations used in this document are defined in BCP 101.


2.  Updates to BCP 101

   A Trust ("the IETF Trust") has been formed for the purpose of
   acquiring, holding, maintaining and licensing certain existing and
   future intellectual property and other property used in connection
   with the administration of the IETF.  The Trustees of the IETF Trust
   are the then current IAOC members, and the Beneficiary of the IETF
   Trust is the IETF as a whole.

   In its administration of IPR under the terms of BCP 101, the IASA,
   including the IAD and the IAOC, will consider the IETF Trust rather
   than ISOC as the proper entity for ownership and licensing of IETF
   IPR.


3.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security implications for the Internet.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no action by the IANA.


5.  Acknowledgements
