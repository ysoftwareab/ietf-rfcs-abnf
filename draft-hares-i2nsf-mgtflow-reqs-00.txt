1.  Introduction

   The Interface to the Network Security Function (I2NSF) Working Group
   is chartered with providing architecture and mechanisms to inject
   into and retrieve information from network security devices.  The
   I2NSF problem statement ([I-D.ietf-i2nsf-problem-and-use-cases]
   indicates that service providers lack a standard management interface
   which preserves:

   o  critical communications during DDoS attacks (DOTS),

   o  allows hosts to continue even during the DDoS attacks,

   o  aids reporting of these attacks the CERT (MILE),

   o  and manages network connnectivity of devices out of compliance
      (SACM).

   This document describes the stress on I2NSF management traffic during
   DDoS and network attacks/incidents, and some mechanisms that help
   traffic flow during these periods.  I2NSF considers two directions:
   I2NSF controller to NSF/vNSF, and I2NSF user to I2NSF controller.

2.  Stresses on traffic between I2NSF and vNSF/NSF

   During periods of DDoS attacks, I2NSF management traffic may
   encounter high error rates, congestion, restricted bandwidth caused
   by DDoS related traffic (ICMP spams, transport protocol SYN attacks,
   port spams, and others.), or attacks on specific network machines.
   Message integrity may be compromised by attacks on the transport

   protocols, or by replay attacks on message sequence.  However, during
   this same time period the I2NSF controller needs to send to NSFs/
   vNSFs new filter policies or other configuration changes.  IDS/IPS
   NSF functions may need to send I2NSF controller information to help
   detect the attack source or stop the attack.

   During DDOS attacks or network security incidents, the client
   programs may want to receive status information from the I2NSF
   controller.  This communication will also be impacted by the high
   error rates, congestion, and restricted bandwidth caused by DDoS
   related traffic or network security attacks.

   This stress can be illustrated by examining two types of management
   traffic which need to be exchanged with the I2NSF controller: DDoS
   Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) traffic, and security incident (CERT)
   traffic reports.

2.1.  DOTS (DDoS Open Threat Signaling) Management Traffic

   Sending information about DDoS threats occurs during periods where
   the DDoS is congesting the network or causing large packet losses.
   I2NSF controllers may receive requests from DOTS controllers to
   configure new network security functions (NSFs) or reconfigure
   existing security functions on vNSF or NSF devices.  I2NSF
   controllers may need to receive specific events from vNSF/NSF
   devices, and receive traffic monitoring data and logs regarding
   network security incidents.

   The DOTS requirements for messages from devices with security
   functions (such as firewalls in routing devices) are specified in:
   [I-D.ietf-dots-requirements].  The following are DOTS descriptions of
   the resiliency needed by the management data:

   o  Resilence (DOTS-G-003) in the face of severally constrained
      severely constrained network conditions imposed by the attack
      traffic.  The protocol SHOULD be resilient, that is, continue
      operating despite message loss and out-of-order or redundant
      signal delivery,

   o  Small message sizes (DOTS-G-005) to prevent fragmentation so that
      all of the message goes through in attack,

   o  Message integrity (G-006) and Message level replay protection
      (G-007) must exist for data streams even during periods of attack,

   o  Session-level Health monitoring (aka Heart beats) during attack
      (DOTS-OP-003), and

   o  Abiilty to request/stop mitigation quickly (DOTS-OP-005)

2.2.  MILE - Managed Incident Lightweight Exchange

   Reporting and managing security incident traffic is being
   investigated by the MILE working group.  The MILE related protocols
   ([RFC5070], [I-D.ietf-mile-rfc5070-bis]) provide data formats for
   reporting network security incidents during time periods of network
   attack.  Similar to DOTS, the data passed by these protocols requires
   resilience, message integrity, message level replay protection, and
   session-level health monitoring.  During these attacks, the use of
   small message sizes may be necessary.

3.  Stresses on I2NSF controller to User traffic

   The user application communicating with the network security
   controller uses the I2NSF protocol to:

   o  give commands that direct the actions of the Network Security
      Controller during normal operation and during periods of security
      attack,

   o  give commands to direct the creation of policy on the Network
      Security controller, or on the NSF or vNSF devices,

   o  receive reports on the status of network security including DDoS
      attacks, outages, and devices operating outside the appropriate
      security software or actions, and

   o  give commands to link the network security controller to
      additional resources (e.g.  CERT for incident report or additional
      IDS/IPS services)/

   The communication to perform security operations may encounter DDoS
   and network attack related outages, network congestion (bursts of
   congestion or time periods of congestion), and specific network
   attacks on messages protocols (E.g.  TCP syn attacks, ICMP based
   attacks).

4.  I2NSF Management Traffic Flow Needs

   The I2NSF communication needs to support application layer services
   that handle the transport layer's failure to support critical
   communication.  These application services must provide the following
   to preserve the end-to-end communication between I2NSF controller to
   NSF/vNSF and between I2NSF controller and the user:

   o  data flow resilence,

Internet-Draft               I2RS Data Flow                   March 2016


   o  breaking the data traffic into appropriate sizes for pass through
      congestion (aka "chunking" the data) and re-assembly of data prior
      to handing to application,

   o  message integrity and replay protection,

   Each I2NSF agent and I2NSF client needs to provide this support at
   the application level since security attacks often attack the
   tranport connections.  This is true whether the communication is
   between the I2NSF Controller to vNSF/NSF device, or between the
   user's client device and the I2NSF controller.

5.  I2NSF Protocol with Session Layer Services

   the application layer of the I2NSF protocol that could provide these

6.  Impact of I2NSF potential use of I2RS protocol

   I2NSF protocol may want to consider extending the I2RS protocol
   [I-D.hares-i2rs-protocol-strawman] for communication to routers/
   switches that have onboard security functions.  The first version of

Internet-Draft               I2RS Data Flow                   March 2016


   the I2RS protocol will support communication by NETCONF [RFC6241]
   (with extensions), RESTCONF [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf] (with
   extensions), and other protocols.  The I2RS working group is seeking
   feedback on management traffic during network outages (security
   related or network connectivity related) in order to determine what
   protocols are needed beyond NETCONF and RESTCONF.  This management
   traffic includes configuration, events, log information, alerts,
   traffic monitoring information, traffic statistics, and end-to-end
   performance information.  I2NSF could help the I2RS working group
   determine the security management information needed to be passed to
   NSF or vNSF functions in routers.
