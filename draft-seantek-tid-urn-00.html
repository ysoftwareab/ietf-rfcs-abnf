<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Introduction</h3>

<p>In modern commerce, parties typically record unique transaction identifiers (TIDs)
			to memorialize economic transactions. The goal of this namespace is to
			provide a uniform syntax for embedding such identifiers in Uniform Resource
			Identifiers (URIs), specifically Uniform Resource Names (URNs).
</p>
<p>
			A transaction identifier is any identifier for an economic transaction 
where goods or services are exchanged. Examples of such transactions include
orders for books and transfers of money for any purpose, including gift 
transfers.
</p>
<p>A transaction identifier is issued by someone who oversees the transaction. 
Banks, credit card issuers, merchants, governments, and individuals are all 
capable of issuing transaction identifiers. Transaction identifiers are
guaranteed to be unique to the extent that the transaction overseer guarantees 
them to be unique. For example, PayPal generates a unique TransactionID for 
every payment in PayPal's system. Although a TID must represent some sort of 
exchange (or anticipation or memorialization of exchange) of goods or 
services, this specification does not further limit what a TID represents. A 
TID can represent an order, invoice, or actual monetary transfer. A TID can 
represent a failed transaction, such as a credit card authorization request 
that was subsequently declined. A TID can even represent a group of 
transactions, such as "an order for books from five booksellers" where the 
booksellers were paid separately and three of the five books were returned for 
refunds. Simply put, a TID is a key to an entry in a ledger for the transfer 
of goods and services.
</p>
<p>Using this syntax, any protocol that uses URIs can unambiguously refer to a 
particular transaction. For example, an authorization protocol in which access 
to a resource (like a digital download of a book or movie) is requested can 
name the payment transaction associated with the access. The authorization 
server can then look up the transaction in a database, see that the 
transaction was completed successfully, and grant access to the resource.

Requirements Language</h3>

<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <a class='info' href='#RFC2119'>RFC 2119<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<a name="anchor3"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
TID Syntax</h3>

<p>
	The Namespace Specific String (NSS) portion of the identifiers has the 
following ABNF specification:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
   NSS = org-nid ":" 1*(tss / typed-tss)
</pre></div>
<p>The org-nid identifies the entity responsible for issuing transaction IDs.
This entity is called the "transaction provider" in this specification.
Considerations for what an appropriate org-nid is, and how one gets
assigned, are discussed below.
</p>
<p>The tss is the Transaction Specific String. In most cases, the TSS is simply a 
character string that contains the same characters of the transaction identifier
that the transaction provider itself provided.
</p>
<a name="anchor4"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Integral TIDs</h3>

<p>If a transaction ID is
integral, the 
Transaction Specific String SHOULD be represented in the TID URN
as the ASCII decimal encoding of the 
number in base-10 in the fewest possible characters. Whether a transaction ID is
integral depends entirely on the transaction provider.
Note that a transaction provider might issue transaction identifiers
that look like integral numbers, but are really characters, not integers.
For example, a provider that issues transaction identifiers '123456' and '123410'
may or may not be treating the characters as numbers.
If the provider issued a transaction identifier '099999', that identifier
is a clue that the identifiers should all be treated as characters, not numbers.
Treating the identifier as an integer enables localization processing,
because a user agent that shows the TID URN to the user can translate
an integral TSS into displayable characters that are appropriate to the user's language.
This transformation would not be safe or accurate if the TSS
is not demonstrably an integer.

</p>
<a name="anchor5"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
Typed TIDs</h3>

<p>Some organizations issue multiple identifiers for different purposes. As 
common examples, a merchant may provide an "order number", an "invoice 
number", and a "receipt number", all for the same transaction or series of 
related transactions. In these cases, it may be necessary to distinguish these 
different types if identifiers would collide with one another.
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
Examples:
urn:tid:paypal:receipt:1111-2222-3333-4444
urn:tid:newegg:order:55915122
urn:tid:newegg:invoice:54121116

The ABNF:

  typed-tss = type ":" tss
</pre></div>
<p>The type production is the type of transaction identifier, as defined by the entity 
responsible for issuing Transaction IDs.
</p>
<p>Because ":" delimits the type from the Transaction Specific String, ":" has a 
reserved purpose in this scheme. If a TSS includes the colon ":" as part of 
the transaction identifier, it MUST be percent-encoded. Similarly, ":" MUST be 
percent-encoded if used in type or org-nid. This restriction is consistent with RFC 3986 
and RFC 2141.
</p>
<p>typed-tss MUST NOT be used when the simpler tss-only form can be used. For 
example, if "NewEgg" draws from the same ID generator when generating Order 
Numbers and Invoice Numbers, the numbers are unique and there is no 
possibility of collision between the two types. These numbers are not "order 
numbers" and "invoice numbers"--they are simply "document numbers". Therefore, 
the transaction identifier for such a store
would not include the "order" or "invoice" types.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the type may be built in to the transaction identifier. An Apple, 
Inc. order number can be a Web Order Number such as "W12345678", or a Sales 
Order Number, such as "7123456789". Web Order Numbers are completely disjoint 
from Sales Order Numbers: a Web Order Number starts with "W" and has 8 digits; 
a Sales Order Number has 10 digits. Because these two are completely disjoint, 
the TID URN for these two transaction IDs would not use the typed-tss form.
</p>
<p>This requirement facilities TID URN comparison. A rule of thumb: if the 
issuing entity can find a record for the transaction with a single text search 
box, tss (not typed-tss) is sufficient to record the transaction identifier.
</p>
<a name="anchor6"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.2.2.1"></a><h3>2.2.1.&nbsp;
Unicode in TID</h3>

<p>A TID URN can contain any Unicode character in 
accordance with IRI syntax. However, the TSS portion SHOULD be limited to URI 
characters, especially since transaction identifiers are usually combinations 
of numbers, letters, and occasional punctuation like "-". The type in 
typed-tss SHOULD be limited to the unreserved characters of an URI, and SHOULD 
be all-lowercase. If an internationalized domain name is used in reg-name / 
ireg-name, the domain name should remain in Unicode or UTF-8 percent-encoded 
form, and should not be processed with ToASCII according to IDNA. Resolution 
of a TID URN to actual data--which may require a DNS lookup--is a separate 
matter from what the transaction itself is named--which does not require a DNS 
lookup.
</p>
<a name="anchor7"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Transaction Provider Name (org-nid) Assignment</h3>

<p>The most difficult part of this scheme is the question of how to 
consistent with <a class='info' href='#RFC2141'>URN Syntax<span> (</span><span class='info'>Moats, R., &ldquo;URN Syntax,&rdquo; May&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2141] and
<a class='info' href='#RFC3406'>URN Namespace Definition Mechanisms<span> (</span><span class='info'>Daigle, L., van Gulik, D., Iannella, R., and P. Faltstrom, &ldquo;Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespace Definition Mechanisms,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3406].
On the one hand, it is desirable to use short and recognizable names
for common transaction providers, such as "paypal", "visa", and "deutschebank",
and to be able to generate such names from obvious properties.
On the other hand, URNs are supposed to be unique and persistent
for a very significant confidence interval.
</p>
<p>This document provides two alternatives and invites the Internet
community to provide comment and feedback.
</p>
<a name="anchor8"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Alternative 1: First-Come, First-Served IANA Registration</h3>

<p>Under this proposal, IANA would set up a registry for
		transaction providers under this TID URN. The registry
		is first-come, first-served. Any entity with a need
		can register for that entity.
</p>
<p>For each registration, IANA shall collect: a) the
		requested org-nid, b) the name of the entity, c) the
		contact information for a responsible person at the entity
		(or the person, if a natural person), and d)
		any initial type identifiers. IANA may collection an optional
		description from the entity of the TSS.
</p>
<p>No two organizations can ever be assigned the same org-nid:
		IANA will check at the time of the request and will
		refuse registration if the org-nid has already
		been assigned. (TBD: what if an entity requests
		multiple org-nids?)
</p>
<p>It is desirable, however, for entities other than the named
		entity to request an assignment. Specifically, an application
		developer may accept transactions from "visa" and from
		"smalltimepayments", but "smalltimepayments" is not
		yet assigned an org-nid. To serve this case, any entity
		with a need can register for another entity, but additional
		safeguards SHALL be used to prevent spurious or defamatory
		registrations.
</p>
<p>When the requesting entity is not the registering
		entity, IANA shall also collect a statement from
		the requesting entity stating that the information
		in the application is true and correct to the best
		of the requestor's ability (TBD: and other requirements).
</p>
<a name="anchor9"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Alternative 2: DNS Registration</h3>

<p>Under this proposal, the primary DNS name of the entity
		shall be used for the org-nid. Using the DNS name
		solves the problem of using short
		and recognizable names for common transaction providers.
		Furthermore, someone who wishes to design a TID URN
		resolution protocol will have a much easier time
		mapping the URN to a resource when the DNS name
		is embedded in the resource.
		Any problems with who-owns-what org-nid
		are explicitly subordinated to the DNS.
</p>
<p>Using the DNS in an URN may be a surprising proposal,
	especially when Section B.1 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3406'>RFC 3406<span> (</span><span class='info'>Daigle, L., van Gulik, D., Iannella, R., and P. Faltstrom, &ldquo;Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespace Definition Mechanisms,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3406]
	calls it a "poor" choice. However, the primary DNS name of the entity
	is quite sensible in this case given the nature of transaction identifiers.
</p>
<p>The primary use of a TID URN is to identify purchases in a uniform
		manner that can be resolved on the Internet. Therefore, virtually
		all of the entities that would have org-nids would have DNS names, and
		will keep the same name as long as they are conducting business.
		Second, although DNS names change hands, DNS names are centrally managed
		through the ICANN accreditation process and are unique to a
		registrant of record for any given point in time. In other words,
		no two entities can own the same DNS name at the same time.
		The registrant of record at any given time is an historical fact.
</p>
<p>In practice, TID URNs will always be used in contexts where
		the time that the TID URN was produced is ascertainable.
		For example, the TID URN will appear in an e-mail invoice
		of a camera that the recipient purchased, or in a database
		record that indicates that a camera shipped out on a date
		because of a payment associated with &lt;urn:tid:paypal.com:12345&gt;.
		Furthermore, TID URNs in general have great utility to e-commerce,
		but a specific TID URN is only useful to parties in privity with
		the parties that executed the transaction. Only the person who bought
		the camera and the person who sells the camera really care about the TID URN.
		The transaction provider (when different from the seller)
		does not care because presumably the transaction provider can
		distinguish its own IDs from IDs of others.
		If the person who bought the camera later wants to sell the camera, he might
		provide the URN to public passers-by as evidence that he bought
		the camera, but anyone who actually relies on the URN to
		buy the used camera will be in privity with the seller.
</p>
<p>The uniqueness of all URNs relies on the promise of
		every registration authority to maintain that uniqueness.
		At the end of the day, URNs are unique merely "because the registration
		authority says so". Nothing in the <a class='info' href='#RFC3187'>ISBN namespace<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hakala, J. and H. Walravens, &ldquo;Using International Standard Book Numbers as Uniform Resource Names,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3187] or

		actually prevents the authority from reusing identifiers: ISO or SWIFT
		can change their standards if they feel like it.
		This scheme is no different, although it may make this reliance
		on registration authorities' promises
		a bit more obvious. Every transaction provider has an interest
		in keeping their transaction identifiers unique, because
		to do otherwise would cause bookkeeping havoc. Similarly,
		every transaction provider has an interest in keeping their
		domain names, at least as long as they are in business.
</p>
<p>A single TID URN also has limited utility over time, because
		nobody will care that a camera was purchased several years down
		the line (after taxes and other accounting are dealt with).
		This use period corresponds roughly to the lifetime of a domain name.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.1"></a><h3>3.2.1.&nbsp;
Alternative 2.1: DNS Registration + Time</h3>

<p>At least two approaches may be considered for those who consider
			a raw domain name to be insufficiently vague. The first is to explicitly combine
			the TID URN with a time in a manner that is external to the TID URN, but is
			internal to the URI (i.e., not inferred from the context in which the TID URN appears).
			<a class='info' href='#I-D.masinter-dated-uri'>Larry Mainster's "tdb"
			URI scheme<span> (</span><span class='info'>Masinter, L., &ldquo;The &quot;tdb&quot; URI scheme: denoting described resources,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.masinter&#8209;dated&#8209;uri] presents such an option.
</p>
<p>The second option is to explicitly include a time reference in a TID URN itself.
			In that case, the syntax would be agumented to:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
  NSS = org-nid ":" tss / typed-tss

  org-nid = org-name-nid "@" org-date-nid
</pre></div>
<p>In this case, "@" serves as a general delimiter to distinguish between the
			entity name and the date. The date is not optional; it MUST be included.
			The format of the date is TBD, but the proposal in
			<a class='info' href='#I-D.masinter-dated-uri'>[I&#8209;D.masinter&#8209;dated&#8209;uri]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Masinter, L., &ldquo;The &quot;tdb&quot; URI scheme: denoting described resources,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>
			is reasonable, as is the
			<a class='info' href='#ISO.8601.1988'>ISO 8601 date format<span> (</span><span class='info'>International Organization for Standardization, &ldquo;Data elements and interchange formats - Information interchange - Representation of dates and times,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1988.</span><span>)</span></a> [ISO.8601.1988] down to the day.
			DNS names are assumed to be valid for at least 24 hours, so there
			is no need for finer granularity.
			
</p>
<p>The org-date-nid production specifies the DNS registration record on
			the last instant of that
			day in UTC (or IAT). It does not refer to the date of the transaction,
			and no information about the transaction should be gleaned from it.
			In any event, attempting to date the transaction would raise difficult
			and unnecessary
			semantic issues about what the time means, as a transaction can be ongoing (ordered but not shipped)
			or be a grouping of related transactions.
</p>
<p>Including the time complicates the issue of equivalence in TID URNs.
			2009, 200912, and 20091231 are equivalent. TID URNs that have different
			transaction specific strings are surely not equivalent.
			However, the URNs urn:tid:paypal.com@2008:12345 and
			urn:tid:paypal.com@2009:12345 may or may not be equivalent.
			For an in-depth equivalence check to be performed, the checker
			would have to obtain the DNS records for paypal.com at the end
			of 2008 and 2009. Perhaps this is an acceptable tradeoff
			if one must sacrifice being concise at the altar of "uniqueness":
			since a TID is only generated once, the org-date-nid has no
			particular reason to be updated after 2008 anyway.
</p>
<p>Perhaps a better solution is to treat the date as the first
			instant of that day in UTC (or IAT), rather than the last instant,
			and to say that a receiver of a TID URN SHOULD transform a received TID URN
			in one of the following ways:
			</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Do nothing.
</li>
<li>Adjust the org-name-nid to an earlier date, where the earlier
				date value comes from a known TID URN that is equivalent. (Effectively,
				replace the TID URN with the earlier equivalent TID URN.)
</li>
</ol><p>
			
</p>
<p>That leads to a somewhat more natural reading of the number,
			and arguably gives a more explicit hint about when
			the transaction identifier
			was created or recognized (which should lead to better
			matches without historical DNS lookups). In particular,
			TID URNs that are marked with later DNS records, but are equivalent to ones marked
			with earlier DNS records, will tend to converge
			to the earliest recorded date. That date is bounded by
			the date at which the transaction identifier came into existence,
			because there should never be a given TID URN that has a DNS record date
			less than the date, month, or year that the TID URN was created.

Specification Template</h3>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
Namespace ID:

   "tid"

Registration Information:

   Version 1
   Date: 2001-08-01

Declaraed registrant of the namespace:

   TBD

Declaration of syntactic structures:

   The structure of the Namespace Specific String is provided
   above.

Relevant ancillary documentation:

   TBD

Identifier uniqueness considerations:

   The Transaction Specific String and optional type
   are assigned by transaction provider. The transaction provider
   gurantees uniqueness of these identifiers.
   The org-nid identifies the entity responsible for issuing
   transaction identifiers. The degree to which this org-nid is
   unique is discussed further in this document.

Identifier persistence considerations:

   A TID records an historical fact, namely, that the
   transaction provider generated a unique TID
   for an actual or contemplated transaction.
   Resolution of the TID to a particular repesentation
   of that resource, however, is a separate matter
   left to the transaction provider.
   For example, a TID representing a credit card reference
   number may resolve to a credit card statement from the
   issuing bank with the transaction details highlighted.
   The transaction provider might keep this information
   downloadable for some number of years (say, five years),
   and then take it offline. The TID remains valid as
   an identifier of the historical fact; it also remains
   valid as an instruction to an archivist to dig up
   the transaction from paper storage in a vast warehouse.
   However, the TID will no longer resolve to an online resource.

Process of identifiers assignment:

   The transaction provider generates transaction identifiers
   for actual or contemplated economic transactions.
   Names of transaction providers are discussed further below.

Process for identifier resolution:

   Resolution is controlled by the named transaction providers.
   Identifying the services that the transaction providers provide
   is TBD (or outside the scope of this specification).

Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

   No special consideration.

Conformance with URN Syntax:

   No special consideration.

Validation mechanism:

   No special consideration.

Scope:

   Global.

IANA Considerations</h3>

<p>This document requests the assignment of formal URN namespace ID "tid". (TBD)
</p>
<a name="Security"></a><br /><hr />
<a name="rfc.section.6"></a><h3>6.&nbsp;
Security Considerations</h3>

<p>The existence and resolution of a TID URN can disclose private facts
			when stored in context.
			For example, a protocol that includes the TID URN urn:tid:bookstore.com:12345
			may imply that the client user shops at bookstore.com; when the URN is
			urn:tid:adultbookstore.com:12345, one might infer that the client user
			purchased adult products at bookstore.com. (Note that if the client user
			purchased adult products at adult.bookstore.com, the top-level DNS
			record is bookstore.com, not adult.bookstore.com. This example only
			works when bookstore.com maintains separate DNS records for its branches.)
			Other than this aspect, TID URNs do not present significant security risks
			because they only name past transactions (or transactions
			already underway). TID URNs do not embed authorization information.
			Resolving a TID URN only looks up the transaction; it is not intended to cause
			a new transaction to occur, or to change the transaction in any way.
