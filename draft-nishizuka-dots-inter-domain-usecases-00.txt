1.  Introduction

   Maximum size of DDoS attack is increasing.  According to a report
   from Cloudflare[Cloudflare], in 2013, over 300 Gbps DDoS attack
   against Spamhaus was observed which exploited DNS reflection
   mechanism to create massive attack with intention to overwhelm the
   capacity of the targeted system.

   If this trend continued, the volume of DDoS attack will exceed
   preparable anti-DDoS capability by one organization mostly in the
   aspect of cost.  Moreover, possibility of DDoS attack is
   unpredictable, so it is not realistic that every organization prepare
   sufficient anti-DDoS system.

   This problem could be solved by sharing anti-DDoS system over multi-
   organizations.  We can share the burden of protection against DDoS
   attack by inter-domain cooperation.  To accomplish this, we need a
   framework which use common interface to call for protection.

   To describe the mechanism of such a framework, we classified inter-
   domain use cases into three models.

Internet-Draft         Inter-Domain DOTS Use Cases          October 2015


   1.  Multi-home Model (one supplicant and multi mitigators)

   2.  Cloud Model (multi supplicants and one mitigator)

   3.  Delegation Model (both sides of supplicant and mitigator)

   By blocking DDoS attack with inter-domain cooperation, average usage
   of DDoS mitigation equipment will increase.  This will leverage total
   capacity of anti-DDoS system in all over the internet.  With this
   mechanism, we can manage DDoS attacks which exceed the capacity of
   its own platform.

   At the same time, it might be needed to convey information of amount
   of processed threat traffic which would be used to charge other
   organization each other.  However this kind of information is out of
   scope of DOTS.

2.  Terminology

   supplicant:  call for an anti-DDoS action to a mitigator.  It could
         be a service under attack itself.  Also, it could be a
         monitoring system which inspect the traffic towards the service
         by netflow/sflow or DPI, from which it can detect DDoS attack
         in the traffic.  The minimum requirement to supplicant is that
         it must know which IP address is under attack and convey it to
         a mitigator by DOTS protocol.

   mitigator:  protect a service from DDoS attack.  It can use
         blackholing, ACLs, flowspec, rate-limit, dedicated DDoS
         mitigation devices and other methods depending on its
         capabilities.  It must be preprovisioned to determine a DDoS
         protection entity.  It starts DDoS protection based on
         information provided by a supplicant.  The minimum information
         is IP address of the service which it must protect from the
         DDoS attack.  Other information like source IP address, port,
         type of DDoS, etc. provided by the supplicant are optional.
         The optional information may be used, but it might be
         overridden by the mitigator according to the on-going attack.

   Other terminology and acronyms are inherited from [I-D.draft-mglt-
   dots-use-cases]

3.  DDoS Protection Scenario

   DDoS protection can be divided into two stages.

   o  Provisioning stage




Nishizuka                Expires April 22, 2016                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         Inter-Domain DOTS Use Cases          October 2015


   Before getting attacked by malicious traffic, a supplicant needs
   capacity building with a mitigator in advance.  In this provisioning
   stage, following information should be provided to the mitigator side
   to prepare for DDoS attack:

   1.  Protection capability

   2.  Restriction on the range of IP addresses and ports

   3.  Return path information of the mitigated traffic

   4.  Authorization information to restrict the supplicant

   These informations can be conveyed off the wire, thus this is out of
   scope of DOTS.  However, provisioning stage is very important to
   protect the service, therefore we describes how DDoS protection works
   comprehensively.

   o  Signaling stage

   After getting attacked, we need to signal SOS information immediately
   if the service has not implemented any other anti-DDoS system except
   preprovisioned DDoS mitigation.  In this signaling stage, the
   supplicant signals targeted IP address to the mitigator with
   authorization information.  The mitigator decides to protect the
   system based on the preprovisioned information.  This signaling
   should have characteristics as follows:

   1.  Common transport and schema

   2.  Secure signaling

   Even in the signaling stage, preprovisioned information can be
   changed according to the DDoS attack vector.  However, provisioning
   and signaling must be separated to keep DOTS requirements simple.

3.1.  Provisioning Stage

   In this section, we describe how preprovisioned information is used
   to protect a service.  In the provisioning stage, before getting
   attacked, the operator of the service register following informations
   to a mitigator to protect the service correctly and effectively.

3.1.1.  Protection Capability

   Protection capability is consist of three informations: protection
   method, protection threshold and traffic capacity.




Nishizuka                Expires April 22, 2016                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         Inter-Domain DOTS Use Cases          October 2015


   o  protection method

   Available protection methods of mitigator may be selectable, which
   include blackholing, ACLs, flowspec, dedicated DDoS appliances, etc.
   These methods have their own max capacity.  Therefore, protection
   threshold should be determined in advance according to the traffic
   capacity of the method.

   In the case of blackholing, it stops the traffic destined to the
   service totally.  In a way, the "denial" of service is successful
   except in the case of selective blackhole.  However, the capacity of
   the blackholing is rather higher than other methods because it just
   divert traffic to null0 interface of routers.

   On the other hand, in the case of DDoS mitigation appliances, only
   the malicious traffic will be discarded on the box and the scrubbed
   normal traffic will be returned to the original service thus service
   continuity will be kept, though there is possibility of false
   positives and false negatives.  However, the total volume of
   processable traffic is limited to the capacity of the hardware.  To
   reduce the possibility of the mis-classification, which type of DDoS
   attack will be processed and which countermeasures will be applied to
   should be determined in the provisioning stage.

   o  protection threshold

   Protection threshold defines when the appropriate method should be
   invoked to start protection.  Typical threshold is traffic
   volume(bps/pps) of the attack.  Depending on the type of the service,
   the appropriate threshold differs.  If the threshold is not
   appropriate, possibility of false positives and false negatives
   increases.  For example, if the service is widely used content
   server, low threshold of SYN attack protection(rate-limit) could
   cause failure of normal transaction.

   o  traffic capacity

   Traffic capacity is protectable total volume[bps/pps] of DDoS traffic
   which include both malicious traffic and normal traffic.  This
   capacity should be negotiated carefully because it could affect the
   service directly.  From the point of view of the mitigator, maximum
   duration and number of protection could be limited to protect the
   DDoS mitigation system from exclusive occupancy.

   If the protection capability of one mitigator is insufficient to a
   service, DOTS can provide capacity leverage to both the service and
   the mitigator.

Internet-Draft         Inter-Domain DOTS Use Cases          October 2015


3.1.2.  Restriction on the Range of IP Addresses and Ports

   In the provisioning stage, the service should register the range of
   IP addresses which they need to protect to the mitigator.  Without
   this restriction, they can use anti-DDoS system to protect any other
   organization.  Especially, in case of blackholing, they can abuse the
   system by blocking all of the traffic to the other organization.

   In addition, they can register range of source IP address/port and
   destination IP address/port as a whitelist.  If they know some range
   of 5 tuples which never include DDoS traffic, they can exclude it
   from the target of anti-DDoS protection, which reduce the possibility
   of false positive.

3.1.3.  Return Path Information of the Mitigated Traffic

   In many cases, DDoS mitigator controls traffic to divert DDoS attack
   traffic to its own domain to deal with it.  It classifies the traffic
   into malicious traffic and normal traffic.  Normal traffic should be
   returned to the original server, however simply returning traffic to
   the internet can cause routing loop because the returning traffic
   could re-enter the diversion path again.  To avoid this routing loop,
   the returning path should be provisioned in advance.  If there is no
   dedicated line between the mitigator and the service, tunnel
   technology such as GRE[RFC2784] can be used.  In that case, tunnel
   information should be preprovisioned.  In general, next-hop and
   prefix information should be provided to the mitigator to determine
   the returning path of the mitigated traffic.

3.1.4.  Authorization Information to Restrict the Supplicant

   After the provisioning, the mitigator should limit the usage of the
   provisioned DDoS protection entity to the legitimate supplicant.
   Only authorized supplicant can trigger the anti-DDoS action.  If the
   supplicant was not restricted, a spoofed signal could abuse the
   mitigator.  Also, the system should be protected from replay attack.

3.2.  Signaling Stage

   After the provisioning stage, the authorization information of the
   DDoS protection entity will be supplied to a supplicant.  Then, the
   supplicant can call for help to the DDoS mitigator by signaling
   mandatory information.

Internet-Draft         Inter-Domain DOTS Use Cases          October 2015


3.2.1.  Signaling Information

   The mandatory information which should be included in the signaling
   is as follows:

   o  IP address of defence target

   o  Instruction (Start/Stop)

   o  Authorization information

   Suppose a supplicant, which is the service itself or monitoring
   system, can know that the service is under a severe DDoS attack.
   After the detecting the DDoS attack, the supplicant records attacked
   IP address(es).  Adding the authorization information provided in
   advance, it signals protection-start-instruction packet to the
   mitigator including IP address of defence target.

   The mitigator which recieved the signal reacts to start mitigation.
   First, it checks the authorization information to decide the
   signaling is legitimate or not.  If failed, it never react.  If
   succeeded, it checks IP address with according DDoS protection
   entity.  Second, If the IP address was included in the range which
   was declaired in advance, it starts mitigation.  The protection
   method will be selected appropoately according to the provisioned
   protection capability.  Finally, it classifies malicious traffic and
   normal traffic, then return the normal traffic to the service in
   specified returning path.

   The supplicant can stop the mitigation by sending protection-stop-
   instruction packet.  However, in some case, it is difficult to know
   whether the DDoS attack has ended or not from the monitoring point of
   the supplicant.

   The following informations are useful for mitigators in many cases
   but they are optional.

   o  Attack ID

   o  (Average/Maximum/Currrent)Traffic volume[bps/pps]

   o  Severity

   o  Type of attack

   o  Protection method

   o  Src IP/Port



Nishizuka                Expires April 22, 2016                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         Inter-Domain DOTS Use Cases          October 2015


   o  Dst Port

   o  Attack start time

   We describe the reason why these informations are not mandatory.

   o  Attack ID

   Attack ID could be assigned by a supplicant.  By recieving the attack
   ID, a mitigator can tell the attack vector is the same or not from
   the observation of the supplicant.  However, regardless of the
   provided attack ID, the behavior of DDoS protection will not change.
   Therefore this is optional information.

   o  (Average/Maximum/Currrent)Traffic volume[bps/pps]

   Traffic volume information can be used to determine protection
   method.  However, in the case of massive DDoS attack, the circuit
   connected to the internet from the service could be saturated by the
   traffic, so there is no way to know how much traffic is incoming on
   the saturated link.  Thus, traffic volume information provided by the
   supplicant is unreliable.  That is why this is optional information.

   o  Severity

   Severity information can be used to determine protection method.
   However, in many cases, DDoS attack vectors change time to time, so
   there is no constant index of severity.  Moreover, the monitoring
   system on the service side can look through the important attack
   vector which is very severe to the service, so the severity must be
   overwritten by the mitigator if it can inspect the traffic more
   deeply.  Therefore this is optional information.

   o  Type of attack

   Similar to severity information, type of attack declared by the
   monitoring system on the service side is unreliable.  Decision of the
   type of attack must be overwritten by the mitigator if it can inspect
   the traffic more deeply.  Therefore this is optional information.

   o  Protection method

   The supplicant can convey preferable protection method information,
   which could be used to change the behavior of the mitigator.
   However, depending on the usage situation, the mitigator could
   override the protection method.  Therefore this is optional
   information.

Internet-Draft         Inter-Domain DOTS Use Cases          October 2015


   o  Src IP/Port

   In some cases, source IP/Port of the DDoS attack are spoofed.  They
   widely vary and continue changing.  Thus, the mitigator can not
   depend on the Src IP/Port information from the supplicant.  Therefore
   this is optional information.

   o  Dst Port

   Destination port of the DDoS attack can be changed by the attacker if
   they observed the attack on the port is not effective.  Similar to
   Src IP/Port information, this is optional information.

   o  Attack start time

   Attack start time information can indicate the severity of the
   attack.  The mitigator can find the attack effectively by that
   inforamtion if it has a constant monitoring system.  However, this is
   optional information.

3.2.2.  Common Transport and Schema

   To convey the information listed in the previous section, DOTS WG
   will define a common transport and schema.  These are under
   discussion on Mailing List based on the draft [I-D.draft-reddy-dots-
   transport].  Defining these common transport and schema is out of
   scope of this draft.  We note that, with a common transport and
   schema, we can share the burden of protection against DDoS attack in
   inter-domain model, which is described in Section.4.

3.2.3.  Secure Signaling

   Secure signaling is fundamental requirement to the DOTS signaling
   protocol.  Only the legitimate supplicants can use the mitigator.
   Restriction can be accomplished by existing authentication and
   authorization methodologies.  Signaling must be encrypted to avoid
   man-in-the-middle attack.  To deal with the unreliable transport on
   the link under attack, signaling should have idempotency.  Also
   authorization information must be securely exchanged in the
   provisioning stage.  Though these characteristics are important,
   defining the signaling method is out of scope of this draft.

3.3.  After DDoS Protection

   After the DDoS protection was kicked by signaling, some information
   derived from the mitigator is useful to the operators of the service.

   o  Status of ongoing protection



Nishizuka                Expires April 22, 2016                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         Inter-Domain DOTS Use Cases          October 2015


   Status of the protection(The attack is ongoing or not) will be used
   to determine that the system is already safe without the protection.
   The mitigator should have interface from which the supplicant or the
   operator of the service can get the status of the protection.

   o  Attack information

   The operator of the service will eager to know what kind of attack
   was pointed to the service.  Then, they can study how to try to find
   the best plan to cope with the situation.

   o  Number of the dropped packets

   Number of the dropped packets can be used to create the billing data.
   Some DDoS mitigator may have data quantity charging system to account
   the supplicant based on the usage of their resources.

   How to convey these information is indispensable issue of inter-
   domain DDoS protection.  However, we note that these are out of scope
   of DOTS.

4.  Inter-Domain Dots Use Cases

   We classified inter-domain use cases into three models.  In these
   models, the signaling packets traverse over multi domains.  They
   utilize the common interface to the DDoS protection entities which
   are located in the multiple domains.  We assume that the provisioning
   stage has finished in all mitigators, so by sending signaling
   packets, the mitigators start the according protections and return
   scrubbed traffic to the service in specified return path.

4.1.  Usecase 1: Multi-home Model

   In the multi-home model, there are one supplicant and multi
   mitigators.  The supplicant can use both mitigators.

   Figure 1: Usecase 1: Multi-home Model

   An example of this situation is that a content provider is connected
   to two transit providers.  When the content provider get attacked,
   the DDoS traffic will come from transit A and B.  Signaling to the
   mitigator in transit A can stop only the DDoS traffic from transit A,
   and vice verse.  Though the provision method will be different, the
   signaling interfaces are common if the both mitigators are using dots
   framework.  After detecting the DDoS attack, the supplicant will send
   the signaling packet to the both mitigators at the same time.  Common
   interface of DOTS signaling will shorten the lead time of the DDoS
   protection on both transits.

4.2.  Usecase 2: Cloud Model

   In the cloud model, there are multi supplicants and one mitigator.
   The mitigator accepts signals from multi supplicants in multiple
   domains.

   Figure 2:Usecase 2: Cloud Model"

   An example of this situation is cloud type of DDoS mitigation service
   provider.  Cloud type of DDoS mitigation service providers divert
   traffic to its own domain using routing protocols, that is BGP route
   injection.  Though they need to provision the returning path mostly
   on the tunnel interface because they are not directly connected to
   the domains of the supplicants, they can accomodate multiple domains
   remotely.

4.3.  Usecase 3: Delegation Model

   In the delegation model, a mitigator has both sides of supplicant and
   mitigator.

   Figure 3: Usecase 3: Delegation Model

   If the capacity of the mitigator is insufficient in comparison with
   ongoing DDoS attack, the mitigator can be a supplicant which call for
   protection in other domain.  The provisioning of the mitigator in
   domain B can be done by the mitigator in domain A as a supplicant in
   advance.  By just relaying the DOTS signaling information to the
   mitigator in domain B, the mitigator in domain A can utilize DDoS
   protection of doamin B.  The original supplicant might not notice
   that the mitigation was delegated to other domain.  Even if the
   capacity is sufficient, in some cases, it is effective to delegate
   the protection to upstream domain.  Stopping DDoS traffic at an
   ingress border will reduce unnecessary forwarding.  The mitigator can
   delegate the burden of the mitigation, therefore they can accomodate
   more services which exceed the capacity of its own platform.

   A mitigator can be a broker which select appropriate DDoS mitigators
   according to the capacities and the field of expertise of the
   mitigators.  In this case, billing data could be more important to
   adjust the cost distribution fairly.

   Figure 4: Cooperative DDoS Mitigation with DOTS Signaling

   The figure.4 describes a minor changed version of the delegation
   model.  The supplicants and mitigators can signal each other with
   DOTS signaling.  They can ask for help each other.  In this model, we
   can leverage total capacity of anti-DDoS system in all over the
   internet.

5.  Security Considerations

   As described in Section.3.2.3, secure signaling is fundamental
   requirement to the DOTS signaling protocol.  Only the legitimate
   supplicants can use the mitigator.  Authorization information must be
   securely exchanged in the provisioning stage.

6.  IANA Considerations

   No need to describe any request regarding number assignment.
