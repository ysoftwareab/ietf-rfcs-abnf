                      draft-cptb-grow-bmp-yang-00

Abstract

   This document proposes a YANG module for BMP (BGP Monitoring
   Protocol) configuration and monitoring.  A complementary RPC triggers
   a refresh of the session of a BMP station.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Routing Information Bases, peers, monitoring stations are defined in
   [RFC7854].

2.  Introduction

   This document specifies a YANG module for configuring and monitoring
   the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) [RFC7854].  The model provides
   parameters for defining BMP monitoring stations, the selection of the
   BGP Routing Information Bases (RIBs), provides operational metrics
   and enables to reset BMP monitoring sessions.

3.  Model summary

   The BMP YANG model provides the methods for managing BMP monitoring
   stations.  It includes:

   *  Connectivity parameters, including station IP address and
      destination port.

   *  BMP session parameters, such as defining the BMP initiation
      message or the interval for statistics messages.

   *  BGP Data sources.  The model requires the explicit configuration
      of the RIBs and address family to send to each monitoring station.
      For Adj-RIB-in and Adj-RIB-out, both post and pre policy, the
      model also requires the peers from which to originate data.  In
      those RIBs, the value "all_peers" can be used if the operators
      desires to receive data of all peers.

   *  Per BMP station status and statistics, such as established status,
      number of route-monitoring messages, number of route-mirroring
      messages, number of peer-down and peer-up messages, number of
      initiation messages.

   *  BMP session reset RPC action.

4.  Base ietf-bmp YANG module

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   BGP data is sensible for security considerations.  The model
   described in this document could be used to send BGP information to
   malicious BMP stations.  Write access to this model should therefore
   be properly protected.

   The session-reset action can demand considerable amount of resources
   from network elements.  It should thus be protected from illegal
   access.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  The IETF XML Registry

   This document registers two URIs in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registrations are
   requested:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-bmp
      Registrant Contact: The NETCONF WG of the IETF.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

7.  Open Issues

      Shall we copy the TCP tuning and security parameters from the BGP
      specifications?

      The security considerations section will have to be aligned with
      https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-security-guidelines
