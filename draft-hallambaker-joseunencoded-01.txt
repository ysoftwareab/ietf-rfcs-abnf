                   JOSE Direct Compact Serialization
                   draft-hallambaker-joseunencoded-01

Abstract

   An alternative serialization for JOSE signatures is presented in 
   which the headers, signature and payload are encoded directly, 
   without Base64 encoding. Use of this format requires the use of a 
   binary transport that does not

Internet-Draft        JOSE Unencoded Serialization            March 2015

1. Definitions

1.1. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Serialization

   In the JWS Direct Serialization, no JWS Unprotected Header is used. 
   In this case, the JOSE Header and the JWS Protected Header are the 
   same.

   In the JWS Direct Serialization, a JWS is represented as the 
   concatenation:

   UTF8(JWS Protected Header)) || '.' || (JWS Payload) || '.' ||

   (JWS Signature)

   The calculation of the signature is performed over the octet sequence
   that corresponds to the concatenation:

   UTF8(JWS Protected Header)) || '.' || (JWS Payload) || '.'

3. Acknowledgements

   Mike Jones provided advice on an early version of this proposal.

4. Security Considerations

   The security considerations presented in [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-
   signature] apply.

5. IANA Considerations

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: jose+direct

   Required parameters: n/a

   Optional parameters: n/a

   Encoding considerations: 8bit; application/jose+direct values are 
   represented as a JSON Object; UTF-8 encoding SHOULD be employed for 
   the JSON object.
