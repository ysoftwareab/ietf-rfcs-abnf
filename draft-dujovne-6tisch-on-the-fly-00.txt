                   draft-dujovne-6tisch-on-the-fly-00

Abstract

   This document describes the environment, problem statement, and goals
   of the On-The-Fly (OTF) scheduling for the IEEE802.15.4e TSCH MAC
   protocol in the context of LLNs.  The purpose of OTF is to
   dynamically adapt the number of reserved cells between neighbor nodes
   to satisfy different type of constraints, based on the specific
   application.  The cell reservation with OTF is distributed: neighbor
   nodes negotiate the cell(s) to be (re)allocated/deleted among them,
   without the intervention of a centralized entity.  This document aims
   to define a module which uses the functionalities provided by the
   6top sublayer to extract statistics and to reserve/delete cells in
   the schedule, leaving the reservation/deletion algorithm, and the
   number and type of statistics to be used in the algorithm itself,
   open.  OTF allows to reserve/delete either a single cell between a
   couple of nodes, or a set of them (i.e., a bundle) in the TSCH
   schedule.  Also, OTF allows to negotiate the aggregate bandwidth of a
   link without explicitly dealing with a reservation of a specific
   subset of cells.

1.  Introduction

   The IEEE802.15.4e standard [IEEE802154e] was published in 2012 as an
   amendment to the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol defined by the
   IEEE802.15.4-2011 [IEEE802154] standard.  The Timeslotted Channel
   Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE802.15.4e is the object of this document.

   On-The-Fly (OTF) scheduling is a distributed protocol intended to
   enable a node to define a common schedule with its neighbors without
   the intervention of a centralized entity.  In particular, this
   document describes the methods, flows and packets involved in this
   process by using the functionalities offered by the 6top sublayer, as
   defined in [I-D.wang-6tisch-6top].  In order to be extendible, and
   thus, applicable in different scenario, OTF has not been designed for

   working with a specific scheduling algorithm nor with a well-defined
   set of statistics.  It provides a general framework and a set of
   methods that can be used by different algorithms.  This document
   follows the terminology defined in
   [I-D.palattella-6tisch-terminology] and the mechanisms described on
   [I-D.watteyne-6tisch-tsch]

2.  Allocation policy

   OTF Cell allocation is distributed.  All the allocation requests are
   sent to 6top, which will be in charge of granting the requested
   Softcells or Bundles.  Since the requests are satisfied on a peer to
   peer basis, without the participation of a PCE, this may generate
   Softcell reservation collisions between different pairs of nodes.
   Although distributed reservation reduces the latency, this can be
   done at the cost of increasing the Softcell allocation collision
   probability There are 3 types of allocation policies supported by
   OTF, namely Post-allocation, Pre-allocation and Hybrid allocation.

   On the Post-allocation policy, according to the current algorithm
   decision, OTF sends allocation requests to 6top for individual
   softcells.  After the softcells are granted, OTF keeps track of the
   number of cells allocated for each of the neighbours.  If the
   algorithm decides to free cells to any neighbour, a deallocation
   request is issued to 6top.  When the deallocation is confirmed, OTF
   updates the internal cell allocation tables.

   On the Pre-allocation policy, given a decision from the algorithm,
   OTF requests to 6top the allocation of a block of Softcells, called a
   Bundle.  When the allocation is granted, the algorithm decides which
   of the allocated cells inside the Bundle will be used for
   communication.  The remaining cells inside the Bundle will remain
   allocated but not used.  OTF keeps track of the allocated Bundles,
   and the number of used cells inside the Bundle.  Used cells inside a
   Bundle are consecutive starting from the first cell in the Bundle.
   When the algorihtm decides to enlarge or reduce the Bundle size, OTF
   forwards this request to 6top.

   On the Hybrid allocation policy, when the algorithm issues an
   allocation request for new cells, OTF must decide between allocating
   individual softcells, incrementing the number of used cells within a
   Bundle, or request to 6top to enlarge the Bundle if there were no
   free cells inside.  OTF keps track of the individual softcells, the
   allocated Bundles and the number of allocated cells inside the
   Bundle.

2.1.  Allocation methods

   OTF uses two allocation methods: Bundle and Softcell.

   The Bundle allocation method requests to 6top a group of cells called
   a Bundle.  OTF manages internally the allocation of individual cells
   within the Bundle.  The goal of this allocation method is to provide
   a low-delay response after a surge in bandwidth usage, at the expense
   of energy consumption.  Once the Bundle is allocated, OTF may ask for
   sizing/re-sizing BW of a bundle, which implies softcells will be
   reserved.  For this purpose, OTF only calculates required Bandwidth,
   and 6top maps the BW to the number of soft cells according to some
   QoS setting, e.g. over-provision ratio, and then allocates and
   maintains them.

   The Softcell allocation method calculates the required Bandwidth and
   requests individual softcells to 6top.  The 6top layer allocates and
   maintains the individual softcells.  This method reduces energy
   consumption by allocating only the required bandwidth, to the expense
   of increasing cell allocation latency.
