1.  Introduction

   Traditionally, MPLS-TE traffic assurance requires the corresponding
   network devices support MPLS or the complex RSVP/LDP/Segment Routing
   etc. technologies to assure the end-to-end traffic performance.  But
   in native IP network, there will be no such signaling protocol to
   synchronize the action among different network devices.  It is
   necessary to use the central control mode that described in [RFC8283]
   to correlate the forwarding behavior among different network devices.
   Draft [I-D.ietf-teas-pce-native-ip] describes the architecture and
   solution philosophy for the end2end traffic assurance in Native IP
   network via Dual/Multi BGP solution.  This draft describes the
   corresponding PCEP extension to transfer the key information about
   peer address list, peer prefix association and the explicit peer
   route on on-path router.

3.  New Objects Extension

   Three new objects are defined in this draft:

   o  PAL Object: Peer Address List Object, used to tell the network
      device which peer it should be peered with dynamically

   o  PPA Object: Peer Prefix Association Object,used to tell which
      prefixes should be advertised via the corresponding peer

   o  EPR Objec: Explicit Peer Route object,used to point out which
      route should be taken to arrive to the peer.

4.  Object Formats

   Each extension object takes the similar format, that is to say, it
   began with the common object header defined in [RFC5440] as the
   following:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Different object-class, object type and the corresponding object body
   is defined separated in the following section.

4.1.  Peer Address List object

   The Peer Address List object is used in a PCE Initiate
   message[RFC8281] [draft-ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] to specify the ip
   address of peer that the received network device should establish the
   BGP relationship with.  This Object should only be sent to the head
   and end router of the end2end path in case there is no RR involved.
   If the RR is used between the head and end routers, then such
   information should be sent to head router/RR and end router/RR
   respectively.

   Peer Num (8 bits): Peer Address Number on the advertised router.

   Peer-Id(8 bits): To distinguish the different peer pair, will be
   referenced in Peer Prefix Association, if the PCE use multi-BGP
   solution for different QoS assurance requirement.

   when AT equal to 16, length is 128bit.

   Peer IP Address(4/16 Bytes): IPv4 address of the peer router, used to
   peer with the local router.  When AT equal to 4, length is 32bit;
   IPv6 address of the peer when AT equal to 16, length is 128bit;

4.2.  Peer Prefix Association

   The Peer Prefix Association object is carried within in a PCE
   Initiate message [RFC8281] to specify the IP prefixes that should be
   advertised by the corresponding Peer.  This Object should only be
   sent to the head and end router of the end2end path in case there is
   no RR involved.  If the RR is used between the head and end routers,
   then such information should be sent to head router/RR and end
   router/RR respectively.
