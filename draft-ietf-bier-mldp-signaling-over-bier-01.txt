                   M-LDP Signaling Through BIER Core
              draft-ietf-bier-mldp-signaling-over-bier-01

Abstract

   Consider an end to end Multipoint LDP (mLDP) network, where it is
   desirable to deploy BIER in portion of this network.  It might be
   desirable to deploy BIER with minimum disruption to the mLDP network
   or redesign of the network.

   This document describes the procedure needed for mLDP tunnels to be
   signaled over and stitched through a BIER core, allowing LDP routers
   to run traditional mLDP services through a BIER core.

1.  Introduction

   Some operators that are using mLDP P2MP LSPs for their multicast
   transport would like to deploy BIER technology in some segment of
   their network.  This draft explains a method to signal mLDP services
   through a BIER domain, with minimal disruption and operational impact
   to the mLDP domain.

2.1.  Definitions

   Some of the terminology specified in [I-D.draft-ietf-bier-
   architecture-05] is replicated here and extended by necessary
   definitions:

   BIER:

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (The overall architecture of
   forwarding multicast using a Bit Position).

   BFR:

   Bit Forwarding Router (A router that participates in Bit Index
   Multipoint Forwarding).  A BFR is identified by a unique BFR prefix
   in a BIER domain.

   BFIR:

   Bit Forwarding Ingress Router (The ingress border router that inserts
   the Bit Map into the packet).  Each BFIR must have a valid BFR-id
   assigned.  BFIR is term used for dataplain packet forwarding.

   BFER:

   Index Forwarding as leaf.  Each BFER must have a valid BFR-id
   assigned.  BFER is term used for dataplain packet forwarding.

   BBR:

   BIER Boundary router.  The router between the LDP domain and BIER
   domain.

   IBBR:

   Ingress BIER Boundary Router.  The ingress router from signaling
   point of view.  It maintains mLDP adjacency toward the LDP domain and
   determines if the mLDP FEC needs to be signaled across the BIER
   domain via Targeted LDP.

   EBBR:

   Egress BIER Boundary Router.  The egress router in BIER domain from
   signaling point of view.  It terminates the targeted ldp signaling

   sub-domain identifier.  A BIER sub-domain can support multiple
   BitString Lengths.

   BFR-id:

   As per figure 1, point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-multipoint
   LSPs established via mLDP [RFC6388] can be signaled through a bier
   domain via Targeted LDP sessions.  This procedure is explained in
   [RFC7060] (Using LDP Multipoint Extension on Targeted LDP Sessions).

   This documents provides details and defines some needed procedures.

Internet-Draft      M-LDP Signaling Through BIER Core      November 2021


3.1.  Ingress BBR procedure

   The Ingress BBR (IBBR) is connected to the mLDP domain on downstream
   and a bier domain on the upstream.  To connect the LDP domains via
   BIER domain, IBBR needs to establish a targeted LDP session with EBBR
   closest to the root of the P2MP or MP2MP LSP.  To do so IBBR will
   follow procedures in [RFC7060] in particular the section "6. targeted
   mLDP with Multicast Tunneling".

   The target LDP session can be established manually via configuration
   or via automated mechanism.

3.1.1.  Automatic tLDP session Creation

   tLDP session can be signaled automatically from every IBBR to the
   appropriate EBBR.  When mLDP FEC arrives to IBBR from LDP domain,
   IBBR can automatically start a tLDP Session to the EBBR closest to
   the Root node.  Both IBBR and EBBR should be in auto-discovery mode
   and react to the arriving tLDP Signaling packets (i.e. targeted
   hellos, keep- alives etc...) to establish the session automatically.

   The Root node address in the mLDP FEC can be used to find the EBBR.
   To identify the EBBR same procedures as [RFC7060] section 2.1 can be
   used or the procedures as explained in the
   [draft-ietf-bier-pim-signaling] appendix A.

3.1.2.  ECMP Method on IBBR

   If IBBR finds multiple equal cost EBBRs on the path to the Root, it
   can use a vendor specific algorithm to choose between the EBBRs.
   These algorithms are beyond the scope of this draft.  As an example
   the IBBR can use the smallest EBBR IP address to establish its mLDP
   signaling to.

3.2.  Egress BBR procedure

   The Egress BBR (EBBR) is connected to the upstream mLDP domain.  The
   EBBR should accept the tLDP session generated form IBBR.  It should
   assign a unique "upstream assigned label" for each arriving FEC
   generated by IBBRs.

   The EBBR should follow the [RFC7060] procedures with following
   modifications:

   *  The label assigned by EBBR cannot be Implicit Null.  This is to
      ensure that identity of each p2mp and/or mp2mp tunnel in BIER
      domain is uniquely distinguished.

Internet-Draft      M-LDP Signaling Through BIER Core      November 2021


   *  The label can be assigned from a domain-wide Common Block (DCB)
      [draft-zzhang-bess-mvpn-evpn-aggregation-label]

   *  The Interface ID TLV, as per [RFC6389] should includes a new BIER
      sub-domain sub- tlv (type TBD)

   The EBBR will also generate a new label and FEC toward the ROOT on
   the LDP domain.  The EBBR Should stitch this generate label with the
   "upstream assigned label" to complete the P2MP or MP2MP LSP.

   With same token the EBBR should track all the arriving FECs and the
   IBBRs that are generating these FECs.  EBBR will use this information
   to build the bier header for each set of common FEC arriving from the
   IBBRs.

3.2.1.  IBBR procedure for arriving upstream assigned label

   Upon receiving the "upstream assigned label", IBBR should create its
   own stitching instruction between the "upstream assigned label" and
   the down stream signaled label.

4.  Datapath Forwarding

4.1.  Datapath traffic flow

   On BFIR when the MPLS label for P2MP/MP2MP LSP arrives from upstream,
   a lookup in ILM table is done and the label is swapped with tLDP
   upstream assigned label.  The BFIR will note all the BFERs that are
   interested in specific P2MP/MP2MP LSP (as per section 3.2).  BFIR
   will put the corresponding BIER header with bit index set for all
   IBBRs interested in this stream.  BFIR will set the BIERHeader.Proto
   = MPLS and will forward the BIER packet into BIER domain.

   In the BIER domain, normal BIER forwarding procedure will be done, as
   per [RFC8279]

   The BFERs will receive the BIER packet, will look at the protocol of
   BIER header (MPLS).  BFER will remove the BIER header and will do a
   lookup in the ILM table for the upstream assigned label and perform
   its corresponding action.

   It should be noted that these procedures are also valid if BFIR is
   the ILER and/or BFER is the ELER as per [RFC7060]

5.  Recursive FEC

   The above procedures also will work with a mLDP recursive FEC.  The
   root used to determine the EBBR is the outer root of the FEC.  The
   entire recursive FEC needs to be preserve when it is forwarded via
   tLDP and the label request.

6.  IANA Consideration

   adf

   1.  A new BIER sub-domain sub- tlv for the interface ID TLV to be
       assigned by IANA

7.  Security Considerations

   TBD
