                  This document describes how to carry 64 kbit/s data streams 
                  transparently in RTP packets, using a pseudo-codec called 
                  'CLEARMODE'. It also serves as registration for a related MIME type 
                  called 'audio/CLEARMODE'.

               1. Introduction 
                   
                  Voice over IP media gateways need to carry all data streams generated 
                  by analog TDM or ISDN narrowband terminals via an IP network. 
                  ISDN data terminals e.g. will produce data streams that are not 
                  compatible with a non-linear encoding as is used for voice. For these 
                  purposes, there exists a necessity for a transparent transport of 64 
                  kbit/s data streams in RTP packets. This mode is often referred to as 
                  ôclear-channel dataö. No encoder/ decoder is needed in that case, but 
                  a unique RTP [5] payload type is necessary and a related MIME type is 
                  to be registered for signaling purposes. 
                   
                  This payload format document describes a pseudo-codec called 
                  "CLEARMODE", for sample-oriented 64 kbit/s data streams with 8 bits 
                  per sample. It can be used for plain data streams (e.g. ISDN data), 
                  also referred to as ôclear-channel dataö. It is in accordance with 
                  RFC 2736 [8], which provides a guideline for the specification of new 
                  RTP payload formats. 
                  This document also serves as the MIME type registration according RFC 
                  2048 [4], which defines procedures for registration of new MIME types 
                  within the IETF tree. 
                   
                   
               2. Data stream handling and RTP header parameters 
                   
                  CLEARMODE does not use any encoding or decoding. It just provides 
                  packetization. 
                  Each CLEARMODE octet is octet-aligned in a RTP packet. The sign bit 
                  of each CLEARMODE octet corresponds to the most significant bit of 
                  the octet in the RTP packet (i.e., assuming the CLEARMODE samples are 
                  handled as octets on the host machine, the sign bit is the most 
                  significant bit of the octet as defined by the host machine format). 
                   
                  A sample rate of 8000 Hz is used. 
                   
                  Note, that the payload format described here assumes that the data to 
                  be handled is sample oriented with one octet (8bits) per sample. 
                  Together with the 8000 Hz sample rate this calculates to a 64 kbit/s 
                  transmission rate. By leaving one or more bits per octed unused, it 
                  is possible to transport lower transmission rates (56 kbit/s, 48 
                  kbit/s, à) too. 
                   
                  The Timestamp SHALL be set according [5]

                  The marker bit is always zero. Silence suppression is not applicable 
                  for CLEARMODE data streams. 
                   
                  The payload type is dynamically assigned by means outside the scope 
                  of this document.

                                   64kbit/s voice band data call         August 2002 
                
                
                  specification [5]. This profile does not specify any different 
                  security services. The primary function of this profile is to add a 
                  transparent transport for a 64 kbit/s data stream. 
                  Confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by encryption. Since 
                  there is no processing of the data stream other than packetization 
                  and depacketization, there is no interference to an end-to-end 
                  encryption mechanism.
