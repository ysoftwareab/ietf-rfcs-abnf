                Reassignment of System Ports to the IESG
                    draft-kuehlewind-system-ports-04

Abstract

   In the IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry,
   a large number of System Ports is currently assigned to individuals
   or companies who have registered the port for the use with a certain
   protocol before RFC6335 was published.  For some of these ports, RFCs
   exist that describe the respective protocol; for others, RFCs are
   under development that define, re-define, or assign the protocol used
   for the respective port, e.g. in case of so-far unused UDP ports that
   have been registered together with the respective TCP port.  In these
   cases the IESG has the change control about the protocol used on the
   port (as described in an RFC) but does not have the change control
   about the port usage itself.  Currently, to transfer the change
   control to the IESG, the original assignee has to be contacted to
   initialize this transfer.  As it is not always possible to get in
   touch with the original assignee, e.g. because of out-dated contact
   information or other reasons, and the current practice of case-by-
   case changes does not scale well, this document instructs IANA to
   perform actions with the goal to reassigns all System Ports to the
   IESG that have been assigned to individuals prior to the publication
   of RFC6335.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 6335 [RFC6335] requires System Ports, also known as the Well
   Known Ports, in the range from 0 to 1023, to be assigned by the "IETF
   Review" or "IESG Approval" procedures [RFC8126].  For assignments
   done through RFCs published via the "IETF Document Stream" [RFC4844],
   the Assignee will be the IESG with the IETF Chair as the Contact.

   However, ports that were assigned before the publication of RFC 6335,
   are often assigned to individuals, even if they are part of the
   System Port range and have a corresponding RFC.  Besides the fact
   that System Ports are widely used by IETF protocols where the
   protocol specification is under IETF change control as defined in an
   RFC but the port itself may not, this situation is especially
   problematic if the assignment gets or needs to be changed.  The
   Assignee can change the assignment without confirmation of the IETF.
   However, if the IETF process requires a change, including de-
   assignment, this cannot be done without the agreement of the original
   Assignee.  Furthermore, no procedure is defined to change the
   assignment in cases where the original Assignee is not reachable or
   not available anymore.

   This document instructs IANA to perform actions with the goal to re-
   assign all currently assigned System Ports in the range from 0 to
   1023 to the IESG, which will also help to align existing entries in
   the "Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry" with
   the current procedures defined in RFC 6335.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA [will perform/has performed] action to re-assign all System
   Ports in the port range from 0 to 1023 that are currently assigned in
   the "Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry"

Internet-Draft        Reassignment of System Ports         February 2019


   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-
   names-port-numbers.xhtml) to the IESG <iesg@ietf.org> as Assignee and
   the IETF Chair <chair@ietf.org> as Contact.  The original Assignee
   and respective contact information should be preserved as an
   Assignment note "Originally assigned to $Assignee <$Contact>" where
   $Assignee is the current value in the Assignee column, and $Contact
   is the current value in the Contact column.

   To perform the assignment, IANA is requested to contact the current
   Assignees by email with the registered email address to request the
   transfer.  If the provided email address is not valid anymore, IANA
   is requested to report this to the IESG, and the IESG is requested to
   perform actions, such as sending requests to the ietf@ietf.org
   mailing list to determine updated contact information.  If these
   actions do not show success within 4 weeks, the IESG is requested to
   make a decision about the re-assignment of the port in question.

   If the current Assignee does not agree to the re-assignment or does
   not reply within four weeks, IANA is requested to inform the IESG
   which then is requested to make a decision about the re-assignment of
   the port in question.

   Before the start of this re-assignment process, IANA [will also
   update/has further updated] the Reference column with the following
   reference for the listed ports that have a corresponding published
   RFC that uses this port number, as well as the Assignment Notes
   column for historic RFCs:

3.  Security Considerations

   This draft instructs IANA to perform actions on the Service Name and
   Transport Protocol Port Number Registry.  It does not change the use
   of the ports or protocols running on them.  Therefore the security of
   these protocols is not impacted by these changes to the registry.
