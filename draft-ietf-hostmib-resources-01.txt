          2.  Abstract

          This memo defines a MIB for use with managing host systems.
          The term "host" is construed to mean any computer that
          communicates with other similar computers attached to the
          internet and that is directly used by one or more human
          beings. Although this MIB does not necessarily apply to
          devices whose primary function is communications services
          (e.g., terminal servers, routers, bridges, monitoring
          equipment), such relevance is not explicitly precluded.  This
          MIB instruments attributes common to all internet hosts
          including, for example, both personal computers and systems
          that run variants of Unix.

          3.  The Network Management Framework

          The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of
          three components.  They are:

          RFC 1155[1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
          describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
          RFC 1212[2] defines a more concise description mechanism,
          which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

          RFC 1213[3] which defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
          objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

          RFC 1157[4] which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
          network access to managed objects.

          The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
          purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Within a given
          MIB module, objects are defined using RFC 1212's OBJECT-TYPE
          macro.  At a minimum, each object has a name, a syntax, an
          access-level, and an implementation-status.

          The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned
          name, which specifies an object type.  The object type
          together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
          specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience,
          we often use a textual string, termed the object descriptor,
          to also refer to the object type.

          The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1[5]
          language is used for this purpose.  However, RFC 1155
          purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
          These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.

          The access-level of an object type defines whether it makes
          "protocol sense" to read and/or write the value of an instance
          of the object type.  (This access-level is independent of any
          administrative authorization policy.)

          The implementation-status of an object type indicates whether
          the object is mandatory, optional, obsolete, or deprecated.

          4.  Host Resources MIB

          The Host Resources MIB defines a uniform set of objects useful
          for the management of host computers.  Host computers  are
          independent of the operating system, network services, or any
          software application.

          The Host Resources MIB defines objects which are common across
          many computer system architectures.

          In addition, there are objects in MIB-2 [3] which also provide
          host management functionality: sysDescr, sysObjectID,
          sysUpTime, sysContact, sysLocation, and sysServices.
          Implementation of these objects is mandatory for implementors
          of the Host Resources MIB.

          Implementation of the Host Resources MIB also requires
          implementation of the interfaces group of MIB-2.

                     An entry shall be placed in the storage table for
                     each logical area of storage that is allocated and
                     has fixed resource limits.  The amount of storage
                     represented in an entity is the amount actually
                     usable by the requesting entity, and excludes loss
                     due to formatting or file system reference
                     information.

                     These entries are associated with logical storage
                     areas, as might be seen by an application, rather
                     than physical storage entities which are typically
                     seen by an operating system.  Storage such as tapes
                     and floppies without file systems on them are
                     typically not allocated in chunks by the operating
                     system to requesting applications, and therefore
                     shouldn't appear in this table.  Examples of valid
                     storage for this table include disk partitions,
                     file systems, ram (for some architectures this is

                     memory, and so on), backing store for virtual
                     memory (`swap space').

                     This table is intended to be a useful diagnostic
                     for `out of memory' and `out of buffers' types of
                     failures.  In addition, it can be a useful
                     performance monitoring tool for tracking memory,

                      worse than running(2).

                      Bits are numbered starting with the most
                      significant bit of the first byte being bit 0, the
                      least significant bit of the first byte being bit

                      the condition was detected, while a zero bit
                      encodes that the condition was not detected.

                      This object is useful for alerting an operator to
                      specific warning or error conditions that may
                      occur, especially those requiring human
