1. Introduction

   This draft provides an information model for the requirements
   identified in the ACTN requirements [ACTN-Req] and the ACTN
   interfaces identified in the ACTN architecture and framework
   document [ACTN-Frame].

   The purpose of this draft is to put all information elements of ACTN
   in one place before proceeding to development work necessary for
   protocol extensions and data models.

   The ACTN reference architecture identified a three-tier control
   hierarchy as depicted in Figure 1:

   - Customer Network Controllers (CNC)
   - Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC)
   - Physical Network Controllers (PNC).

   The two interfaces with respect to the MDSC, one north of the MDSC
   and the other south of the MDSC are referred to as CMI (CNC-MDSC
   Interface) and MPI (MDSC-PNC Interface), respectively. It is
   intended to model these two interfaces and derivative interfaces
   thereof (e.g., MDSC to MSDC in a hierarchy of MDSCs) with one common
   model.

   Appendix A provides some relevant ACTN use-cases extracted from
   [ACTN-Req]. Appendix A is information only and may help readers
   understand the context of key use-cases addressed in [ACTN-Req].

1.1. Terminology

   Refer VN, VNS to [ACTN-Frame] and abstraction and abstract topology
   to [RFC7926].




2. ACTN Common Interfaces Information Model

   This section provides ACTN common interface information model to
   describe in terms of primitives, objects, their properties


Lee-Belotti            Expire December 30, 2017                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             ACTN Info Model                    June 2017


   (represented as attributes), their relationships, and the resources
   for the service applications needed in the ACTN context.

   The standard interface is described between a client controller and
   a server controller. A client-server relationship is recursive
   between a CNC and a MDSC and between a MDSC and a PNC. In the CMI,
   the client is a CNC while the server is a MDSC. In the MPI, the
   client is a MDSC and the server is a PNC. There may also be MDSC-
   MDSC interface(s) that need to be supported. This may arise in a
   hierarchy of MDSCs in which workloads may need to be partitioned to
   multiple MDSCs.

   Basic primitives (messages) are required between the CNC-MDSC and
   MDSC-PNC controllers. These primitives can then be used to support
   different ACTN network control functions like network topology
   request/query, VN service request, path computation and connection
   control, VN service policy negotiation, enforcement, routing
   options, etc.

   At a minimum, the following VN action primitives should be
   supported:

   - VN Instantiate (See Section 2.1.1. for the description)

   - VN Modify (See Section 2.1.2. for the description)

   - VN Delete (See Section 2.1.3. for the description)

   - VN Update ((See Section 2.1.4. for the description)

   - VN Path Compute (See Section 2.1.5. for the description)

   - VN Query (See Section 2.1.6. for the description)

   In addition to VN action primitives, TE Update primitive should also
   be supported (See Section 2.1.7. for the description).

   Note that all VN action primitives defined above are applicable only
   to CMI while TE update primitive is applicable to both CMI and MPI."



2.1. VN Action Primitives

   This section provides a list of main primitives necessary to satisfy
   ACTN requirements specified in [ACTN-REQ].

Internet-Draft             ACTN Info Model                    June 2017


   <VN Action> describes main primitives. VN Action can be one of the
   following primitives: (i) VN Instantiate; (ii) VN Modify; (iii) VN
   Delete; (iv) VN Update; (v) VN Path Compute; (vi) VN Query.



   <VN Action> ::= <VN Instantiate> |

                   <VN Modify> |

                   <VN Delete> |

                   <VN Update> |

                   <VN Path Compute> |

                   <VN Query>



2.1.1. VN Instantiate

   <VN Instantiate> refers to an action from customers/applications to
   request their VNs. This primitive can also be applied from an MDSC
   to a PNC requesting a VN (if the domain the PNC supports can
   instantiate the entire VN) or a part of VN elements. Please see the
   definition of VN in [ACTN-Frame].



2.1.2. VN Modify

   <VN Modify> refers to an action from customers/applications to
   modify an existing VN (i.e., instantiated VN). This primitive can
   also be applied from an MDSC to a PNC requesting a VN (if the domain
   the PNC supports can instantiate the entire VN) or a part of VN
   elements.



2.1.3. VN Delete

   <VN Delete> refers to an action from customers/applications to
   delete an existing VN. This primitive can also be applied from an
   MDSC to a PNC requesting a VN (if the domain the PNC supports can
   instantiate the entire VN) or a part of VN elements.

Internet-Draft             ACTN Info Model                    June 2017




2.1.4. VN Update

   <VN Update> refers to any update to the VN that need to be updated
   to the subscribers. VN Update fulfills a push model at CMI level, to
   make aware customers of any specific changes in the topology details
   related to VN instantiated.

   Note the VN Update means the connection-related information (e.g.,
   LSPs) update that has association with VNs.

2.1.5. VN Path Compute

   <VN Path Compute> consists of Request and Reply. Request refers to
   an action from customers/applications to request a VN path
   computation. This primitive can also be applied from an MDSC to a
   PNC requesting a VN (if the domain the PNC supports can instantiate
   the entire VN) or a part of VN elements.

   <VN Path Compute> Reply refers to the reply in response to <VN Path
   Compute> Request.

   <VN Path Compute> Request/Reply is to be differentiated from a VN
   Instantiate. The purpose of VN Path Compute is a priori exploration
   to estimate network resources availability and getting a list of
   possible paths matching customer/applications constraints. To make
   this type of request Customer/application controller can have a
   shared (with lower controller) view of an abstract network topology
   on which to get the constraints used as input in a Path Computation
   request. The list of paths obtained by the request can be used by
   customer/applications to give path constrains during VNS
   connectivity request and to compel the lower level controller (e.g.
   MDSC) to select the path that Client/application controller has
   chosen among the set of paths returned by the Path Computation
   primitives. The importance of this primitives is for example in a
   scenario like multi-domain in which the optimal path obtained by an
   orchestrator as sum of optimal paths for different domain controller
   cannot be the optimal path in the Client/application controller
   prospective. This only applies between CNC and MDSC.

2.1.6. VN Query

   <VN Query> refers to any query pertaining to the VN that has been
   already instantiated. VN Query fulfills a pull model and permit to
   get topology view.

Internet-Draft             ACTN Info Model                    June 2017


   <VN Query Reply> refers to the reply in response to <VN Query>.

2.1.7. TE Update (for TE resources)


    <TE Update> it is a primitives specifically related to MPI
   interface to provide TE resource update between any domain
   controller towards MDSC regarding the entire content of any "domain
   controller" TE topology or an abstracted filtered view of TE
   topology depending on negotiated policy.


   <TE Update> ::= [<Abstraction>]<TE-topology...>

   <TE-topology> ::= <TE-Topology-reference> <Node-list> <Link-list>

   <Node-list> ::= <Node>[<Node-list>]

   <Node> ::= <Node> <TE-Termination Points>

   <Link-list> ::= <Link>[<Link-list>]

   Where

   <Abstraction> provides information on level of abstraction (as
   determined a priori).

   <TE-topology-reference> ::= information related to the specific te-
   topology related to nodes and links present in this TE-topology.

   <Node-list> ::= detailed information related to a specific node
   belonging to a te-topology e.g. te-node-attributes [TE-TOPO].

   <Link-list> ::= information related to the specific link related
   belonging to a te-topology e.g. te-link-attributes [TE-TOPO].

   <TE-Termination Points> ::= information details associated to the
   termination point of te-link related to a specific node e.g.
   interface-switching-capability [TE-TOPO].



2.2. VN Objects

   This section provides a list of objects associated to VN action
   primitives.

2.2.1. VN Identifier

   <VN Identifier> is a unique identifier of the VN.

2.2.2. VN Service Characteristics (applicable only to CMI)

   VN Service Characteristics describes the customer/application
   requirements against the VNs to be instantiated.

   <VN Service Characteristics> ::= <VN Connectivity Type>

                                    (<VN Traffic Matrix>...)

                                    <VN Survivability>

   Where

   <VN Connectivity Type> ::= <P2P>|<P2MP>|<MP2MP>|<MP2P>|<Multi-
   destination>

   The Connectivity Type identifies the type of required VN Service. In
   addition to the classical type of services (e.g. P2P/P2MP etc.),
   ACTN defines the "multi-destination" service that is a new P2P
   service where the end points are not fixed. They can be chosen among
   a list of pre-configured end points or dynamically provided by the
   CNC.

   <VN Traffic Matrix> ::= <Bandwidth>

                           [<VN Constraints>]

   The VN Traffic Matrix represents the traffic matrix parameters
   required against the service connectivity required and so the VN
   request instantiation between service related   Access Points [ACTN-
   Frame]. Bandwidth is a mandatory parameter and a number of optional
   constrains can be specified in the <VN Constrains> (e.g. diversity,
   cost). They can include objective functions and TE metrics bounds as
   specified in [RFC5441].

   Further details on the VN constraints are specified below:

         <VN Constraints> ::= [<Layer Protocol>]

                              [<Diversity>]

                              [<Shared Risk>]

Internet-Draft             ACTN Info Model                    June 2017


                              ( <Metric> | <VN Objective Function> )

      Where:

      <Layer Protocol> Identifies the layer topology at which the VN
      service is requested. It could be for example MPLS, ODU, and OCh.

      <Diversity> This allows asking for diversity constraints for a VN
      Instantiate/Modify or a VN Path Compute. For example, a new VN or
      a path is requested in total diversity from an existing one (e.g.
      diversity exclusion).

            <Diversity> ::= <VN-exclusion> (<VN-id>...) |

                            <VN-E2E Tunnel-exclusion> (<Tunnel-id>...)

      <Shared Risk> Based on the realization of VN required, group of
      physical resources can be impacted by the same risk. An E2E
      tunnel can be impacted by this shared risk. This is used to get
      the SRLG associated with the different tunnels composing a VN.

      <Metric> can include all the Metrics (cost, delay, delay
      variation, latency), bandwidth utilization parameters defined and
      referenced by [RFC3630] and [RFC7471].

      <VN Objective Function> See Section 2.2.4.

   <VN Survivability> describes all attributes related to the VN
   recovery level and its survivability policy enforced by the
   customers/applications.

         <VN Survivability> ::= <VN Recovery Level>

                              [<VN Tunnel Recovery Level>]

                              [<VN Survivability Policy>]

         Where:

         <VN Recovery Level> It is a value representing the requested
         level of resiliency required against the VN. The following
         values are defined:

         . Unprotected VN
         . VN with per tunnel recovery: The recovery level is defined
            against the tunnels composing the VN and it is specified in
            the <VN Tunnel Recovery Level>.

Internet-Draft             ACTN Info Model                    June 2017


         <VN Tunnel Recovery Level> ::= <0:1>|<1+1>|<1:1>|<1:N>|<M:N>|

                              <On the fly restoration>

         The VN Tunnel Recovery Level indicates the type of protection
         or restoration mechanism applied to the VN. It augments the
         recovery types defined in [RFC4427].

         <VN Survivability Policy> ::= [<Local Reroute Allowed>]

                                       [<Domain Preference>]

                                       [<Push Allowed>]

                                       [<Incremental Update>]





         Where:

          <Local Reroute Allowed> is a delegation policy to the Server
          to allow or not a local reroute fix upon a failure of the
          primary LSP.

          <Domain Preference> is only applied on the MPI where the MDSC
          (client) provides a domain preference to each PNC
          (server).e.g. when a inter-domain link fails, then PNC can
          choose the alternative peering with this info.

          <Push Allowed> is a policy that allows a server to trigger an
          updated VN topology upon failure without an explicit request
          from the client. Push action can be set as default unless
          otherwise specified.

          <Incremental Update> is another policy that triggers an
          incremental update from the server since the last period of
          update. Incremental update can be set as default unless
          otherwise specified.

2.2.3. VN End-Point

   <VN End-Point> Object describes the VN's customer end-point
   characteristics.

   <VN End-Point> ::= (<Access Point Identifier>

                      [<Access Link Capability>]

                      [<Source Indicator>])...

      Where:

     <Access point identifier> It represents a unique identifier of the
     client end-point. They are used by the customer to ask for the
     setup of a virtual network creation. A <VN End-Point> is defined
     against each AP in the network and is shared between customer and
     provider. Both the customer and the provider will map it against
     his own physical resources.

     <Access Link Capability> An optional object that identifies the
     capabilities of the access link related to the given access point.
     (e.g., max-bandwidth, bandwidth availability, etc.)

    <Source Indicator> indicates if an End-point is source or not.





2.2.4. VN Objective Function

   The VN Objective Function applies to each VN member (i.e., each E2E
   tunnel) of a VN.

   The VN Objective Function can reuse objective functions defined in
   [RFC5541] section 4.

   For a single path computation, the following objective functions are
   defined:

          o MCP is the Minimum Cost Path with respect to a specific
             metric (e.g. shortest path).
          o MLP is the Minimum Load Path, that means find a path
             composted by te-link least loaded.
          o MBP is the Maximum residual Bandwidth Path.


   For a concurrent path computation, the following objective functions
   are defined:

          o MBC is to Minimize aggregate Bandwidth Consumption.
          o MLL is to Minimize the Load of the most loaded Link.
          o MCC is to Minimize the Cumulative Cost of a set of paths.

2.2.5. VN Action Status

   <VN Action Status> is the status indicator whether the VN has been
   successfully instantiated, modified, or deleted in the server
   network or not in response to a particular VN action.

   Note that this action status object can be implicitly indicated and
   thus not included in any of the VN primitives discussed in Section
   2.3.



2.2.6. VN Associated LSP

   <VN Associated LSP> describes the instantiated LSPs that is
   associated with the VN. <VN Associated LSP> is used between each
   domain PNC and the MDSC as part of VN Update once the VN is
   instantiated in each domain network and when CNC want to have more
   details about the topology instantiated as consequence of a VN
   Instantiate.

   <VN Associated LSP> ::= <VN Identifier> (<LSP>...)

2.2.7. VN Computed Path

   The VN Computed Path is the list of paths obtained after the VN path
   computation request from higher controller. Note that the computed
   path is to be distinguished from the LSP. When the computed path is
   signaled in the network (and thus the resource is reserved for that
   path), it becomes an LSP.

   <VN Computed Path> ::= (<Path>...)

2.2.8. VN Service Preference

   This section provides VN Service preference. VN Service is defined
   in Section 2.

   <VN Service Preference> ::= [<Location Service Preference >]

                           [<Client-specific Preference >]

                           [<End-Point Dynamic Selection Preference >]

Internet-Draft             ACTN Info Model                    June 2017


   Where

      <Location Service Preference describes the End-Point Location's
      (e.g. Data Centers) support for certain Virtual Network Functions
      (VNFs) (e.g., security function, firewall capability, etc.)and is
      used to find the path that satisfies the VNF constraint.


      <Client-specific Preference> describes any preference related to
      Virtual Network Service (VNS) that application/client can enforce
      via CNC towards lower level controllers. For example, permission
      the correct selection from the network of the destination related
      to the indicated VNF It is e.g. the case of VM migration among
      data center and CNC can enforce specific policy that can permit
      MDSC/PNC to calculate the correct path for the connectivity
      supporting the data center interconnection required by
      application.

      <End-Point Dynamic Selection Preference> describes if the End-
      Point (e.g. Data Center) can support load balancing, disaster
      recovery or VM migration and so can be part of the selection by
      MDSC following service Preference enforcement by CNC.

2.3. Mapping of VN Primitives with VN Objects

   This section describes the mapping of VN Primitives with VN Objects
   based on Section 2.2.



   <VN Instantiate> ::= <VN Service Characteristics>

                        <VN End-Point>

                        [<VN Service Preference>]



   <VN Modify> ::= <VN identifier>

                   <VN Service Characteristics>

                   <VN End-Point>

                   [<VN Service Preference>]

   Figure A.1 shows how VN service policies from the CNC are
   incorporated by the MDSC to support multi-destination applications.
   Multi-destination applications refer to applications in which the
   selection of the destination of a network path for a given source
   needs to be decided dynamically to support such applications.

   Data Center selection problems arise for VM mobility, disaster
   recovery and load balancing cases. VN's service policy plays an
   important role for virtual network operation. Service policy can be
   static or dynamic. Dynamic service policy for data center selection
   may be placed as a result of utilization of data center resources
   supporting VNs. The MDSC would then incorporate this information to
   meet the service objective of this application.

   This scenario is similar to the previous case in that the VN service
   policy for the application can be met by a set of multiple
   destinations that provide the required virtual network functions
   (VNF). Virtual network functions can be, for example, security
   functions required by the VN application. The VN service policy by
   the CNC would indicate the locations of a certain VNF that can be
   fulfilled. This policy information is critical in finding the
   optimal network path subject to this constraint. As VNFs can be
   dynamically moved across different DCs, this policy should be
   dynamically enforced from the CNC to the MDSC and the PNCs.

   Network Function Virtualization Services are usually setup between
   customers' premises and service provider premises and are provided
   mostly by cloud providers or content delivery providers. The context
   may include, but not limited to a security function like firewall, a
   traffic optimizer, the provisioning of storage or computation
   capacity where the customer does not care whether the service is
   implemented in a given data center or another. The customer has to
   provide (and CNC is providing this)the type of VNF he needs and the
   policy associated with it (e.g. metric like estimated delay to reach
   where VNF is located in the DC). The policy linked to VNF is
   requested as part of the VN instantiation. These services may be
   hosted virtually by the provider or physically part of the network.
   This allows the service provider to hide his own resources (both
   network and data centers) and divert customer requests where most
   suitable. This is also known as "end points mobility" case and
   introduces new concepts of traffic and service provisioning and
   resiliency (e.g., Virtual Machine mobility).

   Figure A.4 shows the flow of dynamic service control policy
   enforcement for performance and fault management initiated by
   customer per VN. The feedback loop and filtering mechanism tailored
   for VNs performed by the MDSC differentiates this ACTN scope from
   traditional network management paradigm. VN level dynamic OAM data
   model is a building block to support this capability.

     Figure A.5: E2E VN Survivability and Multi-layer Coordination for
                        Protection and Restoration

   Figure A.5 shows the need for E2E protection/restoration control
   coordination that involves CNC, MDSC and PNCs to meet the VN
   survivability requirement. VN survivability requirement and its
   policy need to be translated into multi-domain and multi-layer
   network protection and restoration scenarios across different
   controller types. After an E2E path is setup successfully, the MDSC
   has a unique role to enforce policy-based flexible VN survivability
   requirement by coordinating all PNC domains.

   As seen in Figure A.5, multi-layer (i.e., packet/optical)
   coordination is a subset of this E2E protection/restoration control
   operation. The MDSC has a role to play in determining an optimal
   protection/restoration level based on the customer's VN
   survivability requirement. For instance, the MDSC needs to interface
   the PNC for packet core as well as the PNC for optical core and
   enforce protection/restoration policy as part of the E2E
   protection/restoration. Neither the PNC for packet core nor the PNC
   for optical core is in a position to be aware of the E2E path and
   its protection/restoration situation. This role of the MDSC is
   unique for this reason. In some cases, the MDSC will have to
   determine and enforce optical bypass to find a feasible reroute path
   upon packet core network failure which cannot be resolved the packet
   core network itself.

   To coordinate this operation, the PNCs will need to update its
   domain level abstract topology upon resource changes due to a
   network failure or other factors. The MDSC will incorporate all
   these update to determine if an alternative E2E reroute path is
   necessary or not based on the changes reported from the PNCs. It
   will need to update the E2E abstract topology and the affected CN's
   VN topology in real-time. This refers to dynamic synchronization of
   topology from Physical topology to abstract topology to VN topology.

   MDSC will also need to perform the path restoration signaling to the
   affected PNCs whenever necessary.
