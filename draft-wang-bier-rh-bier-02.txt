          Routing Header Based BIER Information Encapsulation
                       draft-wang-bier-rh-bier-02

Abstract

   This draft proposes one new encapsulation schema of Bit Index
   Explicit Replication (BIER) information to transfer the multicast
   packets within the IPv6 network.  By using a new IPv6 Routing Header
   type to forward the packet, the original source address and
   destination address of the multicast packet is kept unchanged along
   the forwarding path.  Such encapsulation schema can make full use of
   the existing IPv6 quality assurance solutions to provide high-quality
   multicast service.

1.  Introduction

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new multicast technology
   based on IPv6 defined in [RFC8279].  In BIER domain, the set of
   destination nodes of multicast message is mapped into a BitString and
   encapsulated into the BIER header.  The position of each bit in the
   BitString represents an BFER.  Compared with the traditional
   multicast technology, the nodes in BIER domain do not need to
   maintain a multicast tree and keep the multicast flow state for each
   multicast flow.

   Currently, there are two methods for encapsulating BIER information
   based on IPv6 in IETF: BIERn6([I-D.ietf-bier-bierin6]) and
   BIERv6([I-D.xie-bier-ipv6-encapsulation]).

   BIERin6 carries BIER information by defining a new IPv6 next header
   type.  During the forwarding process, the source address and
   destination address in the header will be changed.

   BIERv6 carries bier related information by defining an new option
   type of destination options header (i.e. bier option).  The source
   address in the header remains unchanged but the destination address
   will be changed along the forwarding path.

   The differences between the above two BIER encapsulation and
   forwarding schemes are unfavorable for the development of BIER and
   its derivatives.  In addition, when there is error in the forward
   process of the multicast packet, the change of source address and

   destination address during transmission will increase the difficulty
   of fault location and traceability.

   This draft proposes a BIER information transmission scheme without
   changing the multicast source and destination addresses.  The
   relevant BIER information is encapsulated within the newly defined
   IPv6 Routing Header type, each intermediate BIER router will route
   the multicast packet based on the BitString information and its
   associated BIFT.  The multicast source and destination address are
   not changed along the forwarding path.

   The characteristics of such schema are helpful to the rapid fault
   location and traceability, and can make full use of the existing IPv6
   quality assurance technologies to provide high-quality multicast
   service.

   o  Next Header(8 bits): indicating the message header type
      immediately after the routing header.

   o  HDR Ext Len(8 bits): indicating the length of the routing header.

   o  Routing Type(8 bits): TBD.  Identifying the newly defined Routing
      Header to encode BIER information.

   o  Segments Left(8 bits): indicating the number of explicitly listed
      intermediate nodes to be accessed before reaching the final

      unsupported BIER header version is received, the BFR needs to
      discard the packet and record the error.

4.  Multicast Packet Forwarding Procedures

   Based on the newly defined BIER Routing Header, the devices support
   BIER Routing Header will perform the following steps to forward the
   multicast packets:

   1) When BFIR receives the IPv6 multicast packets from the mulicast
   source, it will add BIER Routing Header to indicate the BFERs that
   want to receives such multicast packet.  The encapsulated multicast
   packet will be forwarded according to the BIFT that identified by the
   BIFT-id.

   2) Each BFR (includes BFIR) will check whether the direct-connected
   device support BIER Routing Header.  If yes, proceed to step 3);
   otherwise, proceed to step 2.1).

   2.1) Calculating the IPv6 address of next hop that support BIER
   Routing Header.

   2.2) Encapsulating an outer IPv6 Header to the multicast packet.  The
   calculated IPv6 address is used as the destination address of the
   outer IPv6 Header, and its own IPv6 address is used as the source
   address of the outer IPv6 Header.  BitString will not be changed.

   2.3) Sending the encapsulated packet to the direct-connected device,
   the device will perform normal IPv6 forwarding according to the outer
   IPv6 Header.

   3) On the router that supports the BIER Routing Header, perform the
   normal BIER forwarding process as described in [RFC8279].

   The detail procedures for forwarding the multicast packets based on
   the newly defined Routing Header are described in the following
   sections.

 Figure 2: All devices in BIER domain support BIER Routing Header

   The topology is shown in Figure 2, device A-F support BIER Routing
   Header.  The packet need to be transmitted from A to F.  The changes
   of the Routing Header have been given in Figure 2.  Each device will
   perform the following steps after receiving the packet:

   1).  Checking whether there is BIFT corresponding to the BIFT-id
   locally.  If yes, proceed to step 2); otherwise, discard the packet.

   2).  Checking whether the direct-connected device support BIER
   Routing Header.  If yes, forwarding the packet according to the BIFT
   related to the BIFT-id; otherwise, see sectionSection 4.2 for detail
   procedures.

   During the forwarding procedures, the source address and destination
   address of the IPv6 multicast packet are not changed, only the
   BitString in BIER Routing Header is updated.

Figure 3: Some devices in BIER domain do not support BIER Routing Header

   The topology is shown in Figure 3, all devices expect device C
   support BIER Routing Header.  The packet need to be transmitted from
   A to F.  The change of the Header has been given in the Figure 3.
   When it is found that device C does not support BIER Routing Header,
   device D will perform the following steps after receiving the packet:

   1.  Calculating the IPv6 address of next hop device(Node E) that
   supports BIER Routing Header.

   2.  Encapsulating an outer IPv6 Header to the packet.  The calculated
   IPv6 address(E) is used as the destination address of the outer IPv6
   Header, and its own IPv6 address(D) is used as the source address of
   the outer IPv6 Header.  BitString will not be changed.

   3.  Sending the packet to directed-connected device C.

   After receiving the packet, device C will perform IPv6 forwarding
   according the information in outer IPv6 Header, and send the packet
   to device E.  Device E will send it to device F according the
   information in BIER Routing Header.  In the forwarding process, the
   source address and destination address in the Inner IPv6 Header are
   not changed.
