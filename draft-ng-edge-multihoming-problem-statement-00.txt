Abstract

   This document analyzes multihoming from the perspective of the
   Internet edge: i.e.  hosts and other edge networks.  We built on top
   of the previous work that describes goals and benefits of
   multihoming, and identify problems for the provisioning of
   multihoming at the edge level.  In this memo, we first look at the
   problem of multihoming for a generic IPv6 node, followed by narrowing
   the analysis down to mobile hosts and networks.

Internet-Draft          Edge Multihoming Problem               July 2004


1.  Introduction

   Multihoming has attracted wide interest recently.  Within the IETF,
   Site Multihoming for IPv6 (multi6) Working Group is looking at the
   multihoming problem from the perspective of an IPv6 site, and
   provisioning of multihoming in IPv6 is being solved more or less
   using the core network.  This document aims to look at multihoming
   from the perspective of the Internet edge: i.e.  hosts and other edge
   networks.

   Benefits of multihoming has been identified in RFC 3582 [1] and
   "draft-multihoming-generic-goals-and-benefits-00" [2].  However,
   there is no clear problem statement on the provisioning of
   multihoming at the edge level.  It is an objective of this draft to
   identify such problems.

   By "edge", we refer to hosts or stub networks attached at the edge of
   the Internet that does not have any transit traffic.  The host and
   network may themselves be mobile.  This document will attempt to look
   at multihoming problem at two different levels of details: (a) no
   assumption on the mobility of the edge elements; and (b) when the
   edge elements are mobile.

   It is assumed that the readers are familiar with the goals, benefits
   and deployments scenarios as spelt out in [2].

   We begin by first looking at the problem of multihoming for a generic
   edge element from three different perspective:

   1.  From the perspective of upper layer protocols (i.e transport and
       above), we explore the problem multihoming brings with regards to
       continuity of upper layer sessions.  This is done in Section 2.

   2.  From the perspective of multihomed edge elements, we look into
       the problem of sending packets out given the source is
       multihomed.  This is done in Section 3.

   3.  From the perspective of peers of multihomed edge elements, we
       describe the problem of sending packets to a destination that is
       multihomed.  This is done in Section 4.

   Following these, problem specific to multihomed edge elements that
   are mobile is investigated in Section 5.

2.  Upper Layer Transparency

   By definition, a multihomed node has multiple IPv6 addresses.  Here,
   we assumed that it has multiple global-scoped IPv6 addresses (i.e.
   excluding node-local, link-local, and site-local addresses).

   One immediate problem faced by a multihomed node is the question of
   which address to use.  It may be trivially selected,  or chosen based
   on certain policy or preferences settings.  No matter how chosen,
   there is now an issue of upper layer transparency.

   The more common and widely used transport layer protocols by far are
   TCP and UDP.  These transport protocols associate end-point addresses
   with each session.  Thus, to these protocols, a change in either the
   source address or destination address would mean a different session.
   In order to enjoy benefits of multihoming, it is often necessary to
   change the address used.  Thus, there is a problem of how to achieve
   upper layer transparency when employing multihoming mechanisms.  In
   other words, the problem is to achieve multihoming without breaking
   legacy transport protocols such as TCP and UDP.

   There are two parts to consider in upper layer transparency: (a) the
   receiver is multihomed, and (b) the sender is multihomed.

2.1  Receiver is Multihomed

   When the receiver is multihomed, the sender has a choice of using one
   of the multiple addresses as the destination (we ignore for now the
   question of how the sender learns of these multiple addresses).  The
   problem in this case is how to use these different addresses in the
   destination address field and yet have the transport protocol at the
   receiver associates these packets to the same transport session.

   As an illustration (refer to Figure 1), suppose a node, TX, sends to
   another node, RX, two packets belonging to the same transport
   session.  In the first packet, node TX decided to use RX.Addr1 as the
   destination address, and in the second packet, node TX decided to use
   RX.Addr2 as the destination address.  The problem is how does the
   transport protocol at node RX knows that the two packets belong to
   the same session.

                         destination addresses


2.2  Sender is Multihomed

   When the sender is multihomed, the sender may have to switch among
   multiple source addresses for reasons of ingress filtering [3].  The
   problem in this case is how to use these different addresses in the
   source address field and yet have the transport protocol at the
   receiver associates these packets to the same transport session.

   As an illustration (refer to Figure 2), suppose a node, TX, sends to
   another node, RX, two packets belonging to the same transport
   session.  In the first packet, node TX uses TX.Addr1 as the source
   address, and in the second packet, node TX uses TX.Addr2 as the
   source address.  The problem is how does the transport protocol at
   node RX knows that the two packets belong to the same session.

                            source addresses


2.3  Discussion

   It can be perceived that a possible approach is to separate the
   currently overloaded IP address into individual functions:  an
   "identifying" address used to identify the multihomed node, and one

   or more "locating" addresses used to route packets to/from the
   multihomed node.  In this case, the protocol layers above IP will use
   the "identifying" address, and the protocol layers below IP will use
   the "locating" address.

3.  Outgoing Path

   A multihomed node would usually has multiple, independent, routes to
   the Internet.  Given these routes, how do a multihomed node choose
   which route to send a packet? Such decision can be made arbitrarily,
   or based on certain preferences or policy.

   In addition, it is sometimes necessary for the multihomed node to
   select the route based on the actual source address used on a packet.
   This is mainly due to ingress filtering.  Ingress filtering occurs
   when an intermediate router discards packet because the
   source-address of the packet is not of a valid prefix [3].

   As an illustration, consider a node N with two independent routes to
   the Internet through two Internet Service Providers, ISP-A and ISP-B,
   as shown in Figure 3.  ISP-A assigns node N an address PA.N from the
   prefix PA, and ISP-B assigns node N an address PB.N from the prefix
   PB.  Both ISPs implements ingress filtering to prevent malicious
   subscribers from performing IP spoofing.

                Prefix: PA   +-------+    +----------+
                       /-----| ISP-A |----|          |
                      /      +-------+    |          |
            IP:  +---+                    |          |
           PA.N  | N |                    | Internet |
           PB.N  +---+                    |          |
                      \      +-------+    |          |
                       \-----| ISP-B |----|          |
                Prefix: PB   +-------+    +----------+

      Figure 3: Multihomed node obtaining different addresses from
                             different ISPs

   In such cases, to avoid ingress filtering, node N is forced to send
   packets with source address PA.N through ISP-A, and send packets with
   source address PB.N through ISP-B.

3.1  Discussion

   With relation to "Upper Layer Transparency" (Section 2), it is
   interesting to note that should the upper layer transparency problem
   be solved, the problem of ingress filtering for outgoing path may
   then be trivial.  For instance, we assume that the problem of upper
   layer transparency is solved with an "identifying" address and a set
   of "locating" addresses.  Then, the multihomed node can choose the
   locating address as the packet source based on the route selected
   such that the packet would not be discarded by ingress filtering.

   Using the same scenario depicted in Figure 3, suppose node N now
   acquired an identifying address of ID.N.  Then, the pair of addresses
   PA.N and PB.N will be the locating addresses.  Whenever node N wants
   to send packet through ISP-A, it changes the source address of that
   packet to PA.N.  Similarly, whenever node N wants to send packet
   through ISP-B, it changes the source address of that packet to PB.N.

4.  Incoming Path

   When a node is multihomed, there are multiple paths to send a packet
   to the node.  The question is then how does a particular path get
   selected to be the delivery route of any given packet.  If the
   address of the multihomed node is identical across all paths, then it
   is up the routing infrastructure to select the path.  It will be
   subjected to the routing policy of the core routers to pick
   arbitrarily or based on certain parameters (such as congestion
   condition on each path, etc) a delivery route.  The sender or the
   multihomed node has little control over which route to take.

   However, if the addresses of the multihomed node is different on each
   path, the route taken will be decided by the destination address on
   each packet.  The question is then how does the sender knows the
   different addresses belonging to the multihomed node.  This is the
   problem of "Peer Knowledge".  A slight alternative is instead of
   having every peer node that communicates with the multihomed node to
   know the set of addresses, only a smaller set of intermediate
   elements in the routing infrastructure know.  This is the problem of
   "Infrastructure Knowledge".

4.1  Peer Knowledge

   This is the problem of how a multihomed node notifies the peer node
   it is communicating with the set of addresses that it owns.  A
   solution that solves this problem must also address the following
   issues:

   o  What is the form of signaling?

   o  How are the list of addresses communicated to the peer node?

   o  How can the peer node ascertain the specified list of addresses
      are indeed owned by the multihomed node?


4.2  Infrastructure Knowledge

   Alternatively, perhaps it is not necessary for the peer node to learn
   all of the addresses of the multihomed node.  It might suffice for a
   selected pool of nodes to know the addresses.  In this case, the peer
   node needs only know the "identifying" address of the multihomed
   node, and will only use this "identifying" address in the destination
   field of the packet.  A set of intermediate routers will capture
   these packets, and translate the "identifying" address to one of the
   known "locating" addresses of the multihomed node.

   A solution that solves the problem of infrastructure knowledge should
   also addresses the following issues (most are similar to those listed
   in Section 4.1):

   o  What is the form of signaling?

   o  How are the list of addresses communicated to the intermediate
      router(s)?

   o  How can the intermediate router(s) ascertain the specified list of
      addresses are indeed owned by the multihomed node?

   o  How can the intermediate router(s) change the "identifying"
      address in the destination field of the packet to one of the
      "locating" addresses?

   o  What is the impact of changing addresses by intermediate routers
      on the end-to-end integrity of the packet?

5.  Mobility Considerations

   In this section, we focused our attention to multihomed nodes that
   are mobile.  There might be problems related to multihoming that are
   specific to mobile nodes.  There might also be problems that are
   exemplified (and perhaps intensified) when multihomed nodes are
   mobile.  We first consider the case when the mobile multihomed node
   is a host.  Then, we consider the case when a mobile network is
   multihomed.

5.1  Multihomed Mobile IPv6 Node

   When we refer to a mobile node, it is implied that the node employs
   Mobile IPv6 [4] to gain mobility support while roaming across
   different access networks.  It is assumed that the readers are
   familiar with temrs used in Mobile IPv6.  There is a draft on
   multihoming problem with Mobile IPv6 [5] which raise issues
   multihoming with a mobile node that are similar to those described
   here.  This section however looks at the problem from another angle.

5.1.1  Upper Layer Transparency

   The concept of home-address and care-of-addresses associated with a
   mobile node may be an effective mechanism for achieving upper layer
   transparency.  However, a multihomed mobile node may have multiple
   home-addresses.  Thus, there is still a need to identify the
   "identifying" address for use with transport (and upper) layer
   protocols.

5.1.2  Outgoing Path

   A multihomed mobile node may have multiple care-of-addresses.  In
   order to use more than one egress link, it might be necessary for the
   mobile node to use these multiple care-of-addresses simultaneously
   (for example, to overcome ingress filtering at the access network).
   Hence there is a need for the ability to bind multiple
   care-of-addresses to one home-address.  This is currently addressed
   by [6].

   The problem of ingress filtering, however, is two-fold.  It can occur
   at the access network, as well as the home network.  Figure 4
   illustrates this case.  In the access network, when mobile node MN
   sends a packet through AR-A, it must use the care-of-address of
   PA.MN; and when MN sends a packet through AR-B, it must use the
   care-of-address of PB.MN.  In the home network, when MN tunnels the
   packet to home-agent HA-1, it must use the home-address P1.MN; and
   when MN tunnels the packet to home-agent HA-2, it must use the
   home-address P2.MN.  This greatly limits the way MN can enjoy the

Internet-Draft          Edge Multihoming Problem               July 2004


   benefits of multihoming.

   It must be noted that should the mobile node MN have a way of binding
   both care-of-addresses PA.MN and PB.MN simultaneously to both
   home-addresses P1.MN and P2.MN, then it can choose the
   care-of-address to use base on the access network it wishes to use
   for outgoing packets.  This solves the first part of the problem:
   ingress filtering at the access network.  It is, nonetheless, still
   limited to using only a specific home agent for the home-address it
   uses (i.e.  The second problem of ingress filtering at the home
   network remains unsolved).

                Prefix: PA +------+    +----------+    +------+
         HoA: P1.MN  /-----| AR-A |----|          |----| HA-1 |
         CoA: PA.MN /      +------+    |          |    +------+
               +----+                  |          |   Prefix: P1
               | MN |                  | Internet |
               +----+                  |          |   Prefix: P2
         HoA: P2.MN \      +------+    |          |    +------+
         CoA: PB.MN  \-----| AR-B |----|          |----| HA-2 |
                Prefix: PB +------+    +----------+    +------+

       Figure 4: Multihomed mobile node with multiple home agents


5.1.3  Incoming Path

   The use of binding updates in MIPv6 [4] lends itself very well to
   solving the problem of peer knowledge and infrastructure knowledge.
   The most important prerequisite is then to solve the problem of
   binding multiple care-of-addresses.

5.2  Multihomed Mobile Networks

   The problem of mobile network is discussed in [7] and [8].  There is
   an extensive analysis of the multihoming issues with mobile networks
   [9].  This section merely highlights any problems that are specific
   or more relevant to mobile networks.  Interested readers should refer
   to [9] for details.

   Most of the problems relating to upper layer transparency, ingress
   filtering at the access network, ingress filtering at the home
   network, peer knowledge and infrastructure knowledge for mobile
   networks share similar concerns as with a mobile host (see Section
   5.1).  One particularly interesting problem of ingress filtering at

   with home agents HA-A and HA-B respectively.  Each mobile router
   advertises a different mobile network prefix (PA and PB).  Thus, the
   mobile network node MNN configures two IPv6 addresses: PA.MNN and
   PB.MNN.  Hence, MNN is multihomed.

              Prefix: PA +------+   +----+  +----------+    +------+
                      +--| MR-A |---| AR |--|          |----| HA-A |
                      |  +------+   +----+  |          |    +------+
        IP:  +-----+  |                     |          |   Prefix: PA
      PA.MNN | MNN |--+                     | Internet |
      PB.MNN +-----+  |                     |          |   Prefix: PB
                      |  +------+   +----+  |          |    +------+
                      +--| MR-B |---| AR |--|          |----| HA-B |
              Prefix: PB +------+   +----+  +----------+    +------+

   However, MNN cannot forward packet with source address equals PA.MNN
   to MR-B.  This will cause ingress filtering at HA-B to occur (or even
   at MR-B).  This is contrary to normal Neighbor Discovery [10]
   practice that an IPv6 node is free to choose any router as its
   default router regardless of the prefix it choose to use.  A simple
   solution is to impose a requirement that all mobile network nodes
   must set their default router to the router that advertises the
   prefix the mobile network nodes configured their address from.  If no
   such requirements are to be imposed on mobile network nodes, then a
   multihoming solution for mobile networks must address this problem.

6.  Conclusion

   This document analyzed multihoming from the perspective of the
   Internet edge: i.e.  hosts and other edge networks.  We built on top
   of the previous work done in [2] and [1], which describe goals and
   benefits of multihoming, and identify problems for the provisioning
   of multihoming at the edge level.

   We have looked at the problem of multihoming for a generic edge
   element from three different perspectives:

   1.  From the perspective of upper layer protocols (i.e transport and
       above), we explored the problem multihoming brings with regards
       to continuity of upper layer sessions.

   2.  From the perspective of multihomed edge elements, we looked into
       the problem of sending packets out given the source is
       multihomed.

   3.  From the perspective of peers of multihomed edge elements, we
       described the problem of sending packets to a destination that is
       multihomed.

   Following these, problem specific to multihomed edge elements that
   are mobile (i.e.  mobile hosts and mobile networks that are
   multihomed) were analyzed.
