Abstract

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based
   internets.  In particular, it describes additional objects that
   supplement those defined in the Definitions of Managed Objects for
   the Entity MIB document [RFCzzzz].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL", when they appear in this document, are to be interpreted
   as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Overview

   The objects defined in this memo are used in conjunction with objects
   defined in the Entity MIB [RFCzzzz].  The MIB module defined in this
   memo is a sparse augmentation of the entPhysicalTable of the ENTITY-
   MIB -- i.e., it is REQUIRED that an agent implementing objects
   defined in this memo also implement the relevant ENTITY-MIB objects.

   The purpose of the augmentation of the entPhysicalTable is to define
   a managed object for the manufacturing date of a managed entity, and
   a managed object to support additional information related to the
   managed entity.

3.1.  entSupplPhysicalManufacturingDate

   This object contains the date of manufacturing of the managed entity.
   If the manufacturing date is unknown or not supported the object is
   not instantiated.

3.2.  entSupplPhysicalUris

   This object provides additional identification information about the
   physical entity. This object may be used to encode for example a URI
   containing a Common Language Equipment Identifier (CLEI) URI
   [RFCwwww] for the managed physical entity. If no additional
   identification information is known or supported about the physical

7.  Security Considerations

   entSupplPhysicalInfo defined in this MIB module has a MAX-ACCESS
   clause of read-write; erroreous or unauthorized Writing of this
   object will result in the provision of misleading information to
   network management systems.

   The user of this MIB module must therefore be aware that support for
   SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection
   can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with MAX-ACCESS
   other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in some
   environments since, collectively, they provide information about the
   managed entities and can reveal some aspects of their configuration.
   In such environments it is important to control even GET and NOTIFY
   access to these objects and possibly even to encrypt their values
   when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
