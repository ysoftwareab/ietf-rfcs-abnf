Abstract

This Internet Draft defines a protocol for transport of SS7 MTP3-User 
signaling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using the Simple 
Control Transport Protocol.  Also, provision is made for protocol 
elements that enable a seamless, or as seamless as possible, operation 
of the MTP3-User peers in the SS7 and IP domains. This protocol would 
be used between a Signaling Gateway (SG) and a Media Gateway Controller  
(MGC) or IP-resident database but could also be used between two SGs
if desired.  It is assumed that the SG receives SS7 signaling 
over a standard SS7 interface using the SS7 Message Transfer Part 
(MTP) to provide transport.

1.  Introduction

1.1 Scope

There is a need for SCN signaling protocol delivery from an SS7 
Signaling Gateway (SG) to a Media Gateway Controller (MGC).  The 
delivery mechanism should meet the following criteria: 

*  Support for transfer of SS7 MTP3-User Part messages (e.g., ISUP, 
   SCCP, TUP, etc.)
*  Support for the seamless operation of MTP3-User peers
*  Support for the management of SCTP 
   transport associations between an SG and an MGC or IP Database) 
*  Support for the asynchronous reporting of status changes to 
   management 

In other words, the SG will terminate SS7 MTP2 and MTP3 protocols and 
deliver ISUP, SCCP and/or any other MTP3-User protocols to IP-resident 
Application Server Processes over an SCTP transport association


1.2 Terminology

Application Server (AS) - A logical entity serving a specific 
application instance. An example of an Application Server is a virtual 
switch handling all call processing for a particular SS7 
OPC/DPC/CIC_range. Practically speaking, an AS is modeled at the SG as 
an ordered list of one or more related Application Server Processes 
(e.g., primary, secondary, tertiary, ...). 

Application Server Process (ASP) - A process instance of an Application 
Server. Examples of Application Server Processes are primary or backup 
MGC instances.

Application Server Process Path (ASP Path or just Path) - A Path to a 
remote Application Server Process instance.  A Path maps 1:1 to an SCTP 
association 

Application Server Cluster (ASC) - A group of one or more Application 
Servers represented to the SS7 network by the same SS7 Point Code. An 
SG cannot send MTP Level 3 management messages relating to the 
availability/congestion status of an SS7 destination in the IP domain 
unless the status is true across all members of the Application Server 
Cluster.

Association - An association refers to an SCTP association.  The 
association will provide the transport for the delivery of MTP3-User 
protocol data units and M3UA adaptation layer peer messages.

Fail-over - The capability to re-route signaling traffic as required to 
a next-preferred Application Server Process within an Application 
Server in the event of failure or unavailability of the currently used 

                                                                     3
Internet Draft        SS7 MTP3-User Adaptation Layer          Oct 1999

Application Server Process (e.g., from primary MGC to back-up MGC).  
Fail-over may also apply upon the return to service of a previously 
unavailable Application Server Process.
 
MTP3-User - Any protocol normally using the services of the SS7 MTP3 
(e.g., ISUP, SCCP, TUP, etc.).

Stream - A stream refers to an SCTP stream.

1.3 Signaling Transport Architecture

The architecture that has been defined for SCN signaling transport
over IP uses multiple components, including an IP transport
protocol, a signaling common transport protocol and an adaptation
module to support the services expected by a particular SCN signaling 
protocol from its underlying protocol layer.  

In reference to the SIGTRAN framework architecture [xx], This document 
defines an MTP3-User adaptation module that is suitable for the 
transport of SS7 ISDN User Part (ISUP) and Signalling Connection 
Control Part (SCCP) messages but could be used equally to transport 
other SS7 MTP3-User Part messages such as, for example, TUP.  Note: 
SCCP-Users (e.g., INAP/TC or ISUP) are supported implicitly as SCCP 
payload.

In a Signaling Gateway, it is expected that the SS7 ISUP/SCCP signaling
is transmitted and received over a standard SS7 network interface, 
using the SS7 Message Transfer Part (MTP) to provide transport of 
ISUP/SCCP signaling messages to and from an SS7 Signaling End Point 
(SEP) or Signaling Transfer Point (STP).  The SG then provides 
interworking of transport functions with IP Signaling Transport, in 
order to transfer the ISUP/SCCP signaling messages to and from the ASP 
where the peer ISUP/SCCP protocol layer exists.  Three general cases 
are shown below to cover the routing options in the event of ISUP or 
SCCP transport across the SG as shown below:

1.3.1  Case 1: ISUP transport

  ******    SS7    ******     IP    ******
  *SEP *-----------* SG *-----------*ASP *
  ******           ******           ******

  +----+                            +----+
  |ISUP|                            |ISUP|
  +----+         +---------+        +----+
  |MTP |         |MTP |M3UA|        |M3UA|
  |L3  |         |L3  +----+        +----+
  |L2  |         |L2  |SCTP|        |SCTP|
  |L1  |         |L1  +----+        +----+
  |    |         |    |UDP |        |UDP |
  +----+         +---------+        +----+

SEP - SS7 Signaling End Point
SCTP - Simple Control Transport Protocol [5]

                                                                     4
Internet Draft        SS7 MTP3-User Adaptation Layer          Oct 1999


Note: The use of MTP Level 2 signaling links in the SS7 network is 
shown as an example.  ATM-based High Speed Links could also be used, 
using MTP3/SSCF/SSCOP [3,4].  For that matter, it is possible that IP-
based links could present, using MTP3/M2UA/SCTP.  Also, STPs may be 
present in the SS7 path between the SEP and the SG.


To enable a seamless, or as seamless as possible, operation of the 
MTP3-User peers in the SS7 and IP domains, the SG implements for 
modeling purposes a nodal interworking function.  The interworking 
function purpose is to deliver MTP-TRANSFER indication primitives 
received from the MTP Level 3 upper layer interface to an M3UA-resident 
network address translation and mapping function for ongoing routing to 
the final IP destination.  This internal SG function also delivers MTP-
TRANSFER request primitives to the MTP Level 3 upper layer interface 
from the M3UA network address translation and mapping function for 
ongoing MTP Level 3 routing to the SS7 node.  This nodal interworking 
function is described for modeling purposes only - it is a nodal 
implementation-dependent function that does not affect the peer 
protocol exchanges.


1.3.2  Case 2: SCCP transport where an SCCP function at the SG is 
invoked:


  ******    SS7    ******     IP     *******
  *SEP *-----------* SG *------------* ASP *
  * or *           *    *            * * 
  *STP *           *    *            * *
  ******           ******            *******

  +----+         +---------+         +-----+
  |SCCP|         |   SCCP  |         |SCCP |
  +----+         +---------+         +-----+
  |MTP |         |MTP |M3UA|         |M3UA |
  |L3  |         |L3  +----+         +-----+
  |L2  |         |L2  |SCTP|         |SCTP |
  |L1  |         |L1  +----+         +-----+
  |    |         |    |UDP |         | UDP |
  +----+         +---------+         +-----+

Note: An SEP can be an SCP or SSP


In this case, the SCCP at the SG performs Global Title Translation 
(GTT) for messages in either direction that do not yet have a final SS7 
MTP Destination Point Code address (and possibly SCCP Subsystem).  Use 
of the SCCP at the SG will avoid a requirement for a GTT function 
within the M3UA protocol.  The SG nodal interworking function delivers 
an MTP-TRANSFER indication primitive incoming from the SS7 network to 

                                                                     5
Internet Draft        SS7 MTP3-User Adaptation Layer          Oct 1999

an M3UA-resident network address translation and mapping function for 
ongoing routing to the final IP destination, but only after the SCCP 
GTT has been performed and a new Destination Point Code (and possibly 
Subsystem) have been determined.  The M3UA network address translation 
and mapping function then determines the final IP destination.  It is 
possible that the SCCP GTT result could be a non-final GTT result and 
M3UA would then actually be determining an IP destination that will 
perform the next GTT. 

Similarly messages from the IP network can be addressed to the SG for 
SCCP GTT.  The SG nodal interworking function would deliver these MTP-
TRANSFER request primitives to the SCCP from M3UA. The SCCP GTT will 
then  determine an SS7 Destination Point Code (and possibly Subsystem) 
before delivery into the SS7 network.  It is possible that after SCCP 
GTT the DPC (and possibly Subsystem) result could represent an IP-based 
ASP and be sent by the nodal interworking function back to the M3UA-
resident network address translation and mapping function for ongoing 
routing to an IP destination. 


1.3.3  Case 3: SCCP transport where an SCCP function at the SG is not 
invoked:


  ******    SS7    ******     IP     *******
  *SEP *-----------* SG *------------* ASP *
  * or *           *    *            *     * 
  *STP *           *    *            *     *
  ******           ******            *******

  +----+                             +-----+
  |SCCP|                             |SCCP |
  +----+         +---------+         +-----+
  |MTP |         |MTP |M3UA|         |M3UA |
  |L3  |         |L3  +----+         +-----+
  |L2  |         |L2  |SCTP|         |SCTP |
  |L1  |         |L1  +----+         +-----+
  |    |         |    |UDP |         | UDP |
  +----+         +---------+         +-----+


For this case, the SG nodal interworking function operates as in Case 
1.

1.3.4 UDP Port

A request will be made to IANA to assign a UDP port for M3UA.


1.4 Services Provided by the M3UA Layer

1.4.1 Support for the transport of MTP3-User/MTP boundary primitives


                                                                     6
Internet Draft        SS7 MTP3-User Adaptation Layer          Oct 1999

The SS7 MTP Level 3 upper layer interface is retained at the ASP, so 
the M3UA protocol layer is required to provide the equivalent set of 
services to its users as provided by the MTP Level 3.

This includes the following services:

M3UA provides the ability to transfer MTP3-User messages (in this 
Case, ISUP/SCCP PDUs) across SCTP associations.  Note that M3UA does 
not itself impose a 256 octet user information block limit as specified 
by the MTP Level 3.  Larger blocks can be accommodated directly by 
M3UA/SCTP without the need for an upper layer segmentation/re-assembly 
procedure such as in the ITU White Book SCCP [6] or ISUP segmentation 
procedures. However, in the context of an SG the maximum 256 octet 
block size must be followed when interworking to an SS7 network that 
does not support the transfer of larger blocks to the final 
destination.  This will avoid ISUP or SCCP fragmentation at the SG. 
However,if the SS7 network supports the Broadband MTP [7] the 
block size limit can be increased past 256 octets.  In the future, 
M3UA/SCTP could be specified for use between two IP Nodes directly to 
carry larger ISUP+ (BICC) [8] or MAP/TCAP [9] messages.
 
Provision is made for a seamless, or as seamless as possible, operation 
of the MTP3-User peers in the SS7 and IP domains. This includes:

   - Providing an indication to MTP3-Users at an ASP that a remote 
MTP3-User peer in the SS7 network is not
reachable, as expected by all MTP3-User protocols.

  - Providing an indication to MTP-Users at an ASP that a remote MTP3-
User peer in the SS7 network is now reachable, as expected by all MTP3-
User protocols.

  - Providing an indication to MTP3-Users at an ASP that messages to a 
remote MTP3-
User peer in the SS7 network are experiencing SS7 congestion or the 
remote MTP3-User peer is unavailable, as expected by all MTP3-User 
protocols.


1.4.2 Support for communication between Layer Management Modules on the 
SG and ASP

An M-ERROR primitive is used to indicate an error with a received M3UA 
message (e.g., unknown parameter value).

1.4.3 Support for management of SCTP associations and ASP Paths between 
the SG and ASP

The M3UA layer at the SG keeps the state of all configured ASPs.  A set 

                                                                     7
Internet Draft        SS7 MTP3-User Adaptation Layer          Oct 1999

of primitives between the Layer Management and the M3UA layer are 
defined below for the layer Management to manage the ASP Paths and the 
traffic between the SG and the ASPs.

The M3UA layer can be instructed by the Layer Management to establish 
an SCTP association to a peer M3UA node.  This can be achieved using 
the M-SCTP ESTABLISH primitive to request, indicate and confirm the 
establishment of an SCTP association to a peer M3UA node.

The M3UA layer may also need to inform Layer Management of the status 
of the underlying SCTP associations using the M-SCTP STATUS request and 
indication primitive. For example, the M3UA may inform Layer Management 
of the reason for the release of an SCTP association, determined either 
locally within the M3UA layer or by a primitive from the SCTP.

Layer Management may inform the M3UA layer of a change in the local 
M3UA User status (e.g., failure, available).  Also the M3UA layer may 
need to inform the Layer Management of the change in status of an ASP 
or ASP Path.  This can be achieved using the M-ASP STATUS primitive to 
change and indicate the status of an ASP.

*** Ed Note: This will be moved to a procedures section*****
The M3UA layer may be informed of a local M3UA-User failure by means of 
an indication from local Layer Management.  In response, a peer 
protocol is invoked with the remote M3UA layer to stop traffic over the 
SCTP association until recovery of the local M3UA-Users.  When the 
M3UA-User layer recovers, local Layer Management informs the M3UA layer 
and a message is sent to the remote M3UA layer indicating traffic can 
be restarted over the SCTP association.  The M3UA layer maintains 
status of the local M3UA-User availability. 
***********************************************

1.5 Internal Functions Provided in the M3UA Layer 

1.5.1 Address Translation and Mapping

The M3UA layer maps primitives received from the ASP-User lower layer 
boundary, or SG nodal interworking function, to the SCTP reliable 
transport upper layer boundary and maps signals received from the SCTP 
to the ASP MTP3-User lower layer boundary, or SG nodal interworking 
function.  For example, the MTP-TRANSFER request primitive received 
from an MTP3-User is mapped to an SCTP Send primitive and the SCTP 
Receive primitive is mapped to an MTP-TRANSFER indication primitive 
to the MTP3-User.

To support this mapping, the M3UA layer at the SG must additionally 
maintain a network address translation table of incoming SS7 
address/routing information keys to Application Servers.  The 
Application Server represents an ordered list of one or more possible 
Application Server Processes.  Normally, one of the ASPs in the ordered 
list will be the active ASP for a particular routing key entry.  Note 
that in certain failure and transition cases it is possible that there 
may not be an active ASP.  

                                                                     8
Internet Draft        SS7 MTP3-User Adaptation Layer          Oct 1999


This table is required in order to route the SS7 ISUP/SCCP messages 
incoming from the SS7 network domain to the appropriate ASP in the IP 
network domain.  This mapping is dynamic, taking into account the 
availability status of the individual ASP Paths in the list, 
configuration changes, and possible fail-over mechanisms.

Possible SS7 address/routing information to be considered as a routing 
key entry includes, for example, the OPC, DPC, SIO, ISUP CIC range or 
SCCP Called Party Address. The network address translation function in 
effect defines the SS7 address representation of the Application 
Servers within the IP domain.  As such, the implementation of this 
function must be flexible enough to handle the SS7 address vision of 
network operator(s).  For example, some network operators may choose to 
represent the SG and Application Servers with a single SS7 point code.  
Other operators may choose to represent each SG and Application Server 
with individual SS7 point codes, or may group logical groups of 
Application Servers under point codes.

From the perspective of the M3UA instance at an Application Server 
Process, it is possible that the ASP could route signaling messages 
destined to the SS7 network through more than one SG.  A primary/back-
up case is possible where the unavailability of a the ASP Path to a 
primary SG,or the unavailability of the SS7 destination node from the 
primary SG, could be used to reroute to a next-preferred SG.  Also, a 
loadsharing case is possible where the signaling messages are load-
shared across two (or more) SGs. 

1.5.2 SCTP Stream Mapping.  M3UA also supports the assignment of 
traffic into streams within an SCTP association.  Traffic that requires 
sequencing should be assigned to the same stream.  For example, SS7 
traffic may be assigned to individual streams based on the SLS value in 
the MTP3 Routing Label or the ISUP CIC assignment, subject of course to 
the maximum number of streams supported by the underlying SCTP 
association.  Traffic that does not require sequencing can be assigned 
to an unsequenced stream.  

1.5.3 Congestion Control.

The M3UA Layer is informed of local and IP network congestion by means 
of an implementation-dependent function (e.g., an implementation-
dependent indication from the SCTP of IP network congestion). When an 
SG determines that the transport of SS7 messages to an Application 
Server Cluster is encountering congestion, the SG may optionally 
trigger SS7 MTP3 Transfer Controlled management messages to originating 
SS7 nodes. The triggering of SS7 MTP3 Management messages from an SG is 
an implementation-dependent function.  At an ASP, congestion is 
indicated to local MTP3-Users by means of an MTP-Status primitive 
indicating congestion, to invoke appropriate upper layer responses, as 
per current MTP3 procedures.  Congestion Control mechanisms are for 
further study.



                                                                     9

1.5.4 Seamless Network Management Interworking.

(Ed. Note: It is ffs if this function is modeled in the M3UA layer at 
an SG or is part of an independent relay function at the SG that is a 
user of the M3UA layer and MTP-3 layer.) 

The SG must maintain knowledge of SS7 node and Application Server 
Cluster status in their respective domains in order to perform as 
seamless as possible interworking of the two domains.  For example, SG 
knowledge of the availability and/or congestion status of Application 
Server Clusters and SS7 nodes must be maintained and disseminated in 
the respective networks so that end-to-end operation is transparent to 
the communicating SCN protocol peers at the SS7 node and ASP.

When an SG determines that the transport of SS7 messages to an 
Application Server Cluster is encountering congestion, the SG may 
optionally issue MTP Transfer Controlled (TFC) messages to the SS7 SEPs 
which are generating signalling traffic to the affected Application 
Server Cluster, as per current MTP procedures [2].  

When an SG determines that the transport of SS7 messages to an 
Application Server Cluster is interrupted, the SG may optionally issue 
MTP Transfer Prohibited (TFP) messages to the adjacent SS7 nodes which 
are generating signalling traffic to the affected Application Server 
Clusters per current MTP procedures [2].  

When an SG determines that the transport of SS7 messages to an 
Application Server Cluster can now be resumed, the SG may optionally 
issue MTP Transfer Allowed (TFA) messages to the adjacent SS7 nodes to 
resume signalling traffic to the affected Application Server Clusters 
per current MTP procedures [2].  

Triggering of the MTP-3 management messages is an implementation 
dependent function.  

1.5.5 Management Inhibit/Uninhibit

Local Management may wish to stop traffic across an SCTP association in 
order to temporarily remove the association from service or to perform 
testing and maintenance activity.  The function could optionally be 
used to manage the start of traffic on to a newly-available SCTP 
association.

1.5.6 Active Association Control

An Application Server Process can have associated back-up process.  
When, for example, both a primary and a back-up ASP are available, then 
peer protocol is required to control which ASP, 
and hence ASP Path, is currently active.  The ordered list of ASPs 
related to an Application Server is kept updated to reflect the active 
Application Server Process instance.

2.0 Protocol Elements

The general message format includes a Common Message Header together 
with a list of zero or more parameters as defined by the Message Type.  
For forward compatability, all Message Types may have attached 
parameters even if none are specified in this version.

2.1 Common Message Header

The protocol messages for MTP3-User Adaptation require a message 
structure which contains a version, message type, message length, and 
message contents.   This message header is common among all signaling 
protocol adaptation layers:


    0     7 8    15 16           31
   +-------+-------+---------------+
   | Vers  | Spare |   Msg Type    |
   +-------+-------+---------------+
   |        Message Length         |
   +---------------+---------------+

2.1.1 M3UA Protocol Version

The version field (vers) contains the version of the M3UA adaptation 

                                                                    11
Internet Draft        SS7 MTP3-User Adaptation Layer          Oct 1999

layer.  The supported versions are:

      01   Release 1.0 protocol

2.1.2  Message Types

The following list contains the message types for the defined messages.

     Management (MGMT) Messages

         Error                                     0000

2.1.3 Message Length

The Message Length defines the length of the message in octets, not 
including the header.


2.2 ITUN Messages

The following section describes the ITUN messages and parameter 
contents.  The general ITUN message format includes a Common Message 
Header together with a list of zero or more parameters as defined by 
the Message Type.  All Message Types can have attached parameters.  

2.2.1 Data Message

The Data message contains SS7 MTP3-User protocol data, which is an MTP-
TRANSFER primitive, normally including the complete MTP3 Routing Label. 
The Data message contains the following parameters:

     SCN PROTOCOL IDENTIFIER (Optional)
     INTERFACE IDENTIFIER (Optional)
     PROTOCOL DATA

                                                                     12
Internet Draft            SS7 ISUP/SCCP Tunneling              Oct 1999


The format for the Data Message parameters is as follows:
    0            15 16           31
   +---------------+---------------+
   |   Tag (0xx)   |     Length    |
   +---------------+---------------+

   |   SCN Protocol Identifier*    |

   +---------------+---------------+
   |   Tag (0xx)   |     Length    |
   +---------------+---------------+

   |    Interface Identifier*      |
 
   +-------------------------------+
   |   Tag (0xx)   |     Length    |
   +---------------+---------------+
                  ...
   |        Protocol Data          |
                  ...
   +---------------+---------------+


The SCN Protocol Identifier parameter identifies explicitly the SCN 
signaling protocol being transported, where the SCN protocol carried is 
not known implicitly in the context of a particular association or 
stream.  The SCN Protocol Id defines the protocol type, variant, and 
version, and thereby specifies the components and encoding of the 
Protocol Data parameter.  The SCN Protocol Id may also define what SCN 
Protocol Data components are omitted in the Protocol Data (e.g., 
whether or not the Protocol Data contains an MTP routing label).  SCN 
Protocol Ids will be maintained by IANA outside of this document and 
may be registered on an "as needed" basis.  The SCN Protocol ID is not 
required in Data messages if the Protocol Id information is pre-
configured or identified at Association or Path establishment.

***********
ED Note: The SCN Protocol Identifier parameter format is for further 
study. The protocol identifier values should be maintained outside of 
this document by IANA to allow registration of values without re-
issuing the adaptation layer protocol document. We need decision on 
encoding of mime-type value or fixed string/integer.  If mime-type need 
to refer to "draft-ietf-sigtran-mime-isup.txt" for an example of an 
application/ISUP media type defined according to the rules defined in 
RFC 2048.
************

The Interface Identifier optionally identifies the physical interface, 
or network, at the SG for which the signaling messages are 
sent/received.  The format is an ASCII string, the values of which are 
assigned according to network operator policy. The interface Identifier 
string should be padded to 32-bit boundaries.

                                                                     13
Internet Draft            SS7 ISUP/SCCP Tunneling              Oct 1999


**************
Ed Note: The identification of the interface can be very useful at MGCs 
that are receiving signaling from multiple national networks and cannot 
rely on the SS7 NI value to tell their signalling traffic apart.  
However, no procedures are specified. 
**************

The Protocol Data field contains the MTP3-User application message, 
which is an MTP-TRANSFER primitive.  As defined for a specific value of 
the Protocol Identifier, this will include the MTP-User Data and 
normally includes the MTP Routing Label (SS7 OPC, DPC, SLS), and the 
SIO (Network Indicator & optional Message Priority codes).  


2.3.2  SS7 Signaling Network Management (SSNM) Messages

2.3.2.1 Destination Unavailable (DUNA)

The DUNA message is sent from the SG to the ASP to indicate that
the SG has determined that an SS7 destination is unreachable.  The MTP-
User at the ASP is expected to stop traffic to the affected destination 
through the SG initiating the DUNA. 

The DUNA message contains the following parameters:

     Protocol Identifier (Optional)
     Affected Destination Point Code
     Info String (Optional)

The format for DUNA parameter is as follows:

    0     7 8    15 16           31
   +---------------+---------------+
   |   Tag (0xx)   |     Length    |
   +---------------+---------------+

   |     Protocol Identifier*      |

   +---------------+---------------+
   |   Tag (0xx)   |     Length    |
   +---------------+---------------+
   |         Affected DPC          |
   +---------------+---------------+
   |   Tag (0xx)   |     Length    |
   +---------------+---------------+

   |         INFO String*          |

   +-------------------------------+


The Protocol Identifier parameter is defined similarly to the SCN 

                                                                     14
Internet Draft            SS7 ISUP/SCCP Tunneling              Oct 1999

Protocol Id but in this case defines the MTP3 version/variant.  In this 
context it defines the format of the Affected DPC parameter.  By 
identifying the MTP variant and version, the point code size (e.g., 14-
, 16-, or 24-bit) and sub-field definitions (e.g., ANSI 
network/cluster/member, ITU-international zone/region/signal_point, 
many national field variants, ...) can be determined. 

The INFO String parameter can carry any meaningful 8-BIT ASCII 
character string along with the message.  Length of the INFO String 
parameter is from 0 to 255 characters.  No procedures are presently 
identified for its use but the INFO String can be used by Operators to 
identify in text form the location reflected by the Affected DPC for 
debugging purposes.

The Affected DPC is provisionally a three-octet parameter to allow 14-, 
16- and 24-bit binary formatted SS7 Point Codes.  

2.3.2.2 Destination Available (DAVA)   

The DAVA message is sent from the SG to the ASP to indicate that the SG 
has determined that an SS7 destination is now reachable. The ASP MTP3-
User protocol is expected to resume traffic to the affected destination 
through the SG initiating the DUNA. 

The DAVA message contains the following parameters:

     Protocol Identifier (Optional)
     Affected Destination Point Code
     Info String (Optional)

The parameter format and definitions for the DAVA message is the same 
as for the DUNA message (See Section 2.3.2.2).

2.3.2.3 Destination State Audit (DAUD)

The DAUD message can be sent from the ASP to the SG to query the 
availability state of the SS7 routes to an affected destination.  A 
DAUD is sent periodically after the ASP has received a DUNA, until a 
DAVA is received.   The DAUD can also be sent when an ASP recovers from 
interruption of the transport path to the SG.

     Protocol Identifier (Optional)
     Affected Destination Point Code
     Info String (Optional)

The format and description of DAUD parameters is the same as for the 
DUVA message (See Section 2.3.2.1.)  

***********
Ed Note: It is for further study whether multiple Affected 
Destination Point Codes can be included as a list in one DAUD message 
and in responding DUVA messages.
***********

                                                                     15
Internet Draft        SS7 MTP3-User Adaptation Layer          Oct 1999

The SG receiving the DAUD should reply with the availability state of 
the queried destination in a DUNA or DAVA message.


2.3.2.4 SS7 Network Congestion (SCON)

The SCON message can be sent from the SG to the ASP to indicate that 
the congestion level in the SS7 network to a specified destination has
changed.

The SCON message contains the following parameters:

     Protocol Identifier (Optional)
     Affected Destination Point Code
     Info String (Optional)
     Congestion Level (Optional)           

    0     7 8    15 16           31
   +---------------+---------------+
   |   Tag (0xx)   |     Length    |
   +---------------+---------------+

   |     Protocol Identifier*      |

   +---------------+---------------+
   |   Tag (0xx)   |     Length    |
   +---------------+---------------+
   |         Affected DPC          |
   +---------------+---------------+
   |   Tag (0xx)   |     Length    |
   +---------------+---------------+

   |         INFO String*          |

   +-------------------------------+
   |   Tag (0xx)   |     Length    |
   +---------------+---------------+
   |       Congestion Level*       |
   +-------------------------------+


The format and description of the Protocol Identifier, Affected DPC and 
Info String parameters is the same as for the DUVA message (See Section 
2.3.2.1.)

The valid values for the optional Congestion Level are shown in the 
following table.







                                                                     16
Internet Draft            SS7 ISUP/SCCP Tunneling              Oct 1999

     Define           Value       Description
     Level 0          0000     No Congestion or Undefined
     Level 1          0001     Congestion Level 1
     Level 2          0002     Congestion Level 2
     Level 3          0003     Congestion Level 3

The congestion levels are as defined in the national congestion method 
in the ITU MTP recommendation [2] or in the ANSI MTP standard [10]. 
For MTPs without congestion levels, for example the ITU international 
method, the parameter is omitted.

The ASP receiving the SCON message is expected to follow the currently 
defined MTP3-User protocol reaction to an indication of SS7 network 
congestion.


2.3.2.5 Destination User Part Unavailable (DUPU)

The DUPU message is used by a SG to inform an ASP that a remote peer 
MTP3-User User Part (e.g., ISUP or SCCP) at an SS7 node is unavailable.

The DUPU message contains the following parameters:

     Protocol Identifier (Optional)
     Affected Destination Point Code
     Info String (Optional)
     Reason

The format for optional DUPU message is as follows:


0     7 8    15 16           31

Internet Draft        SS7 MTP3-User Adaptation Layer          Oct 1999

The format and description of the Protocol Identifier, Affected DPC and 
Info String parameters is the same as for the DUVA message (See Section 
2.3.2.1.) 

The valid values for Reason are shown in the following table.

     Define           Value       Description
     UPU-Unknown      0x4    MTP User Part Unavailable, No Reason Given
     UPU-Unequipped   0x5    MTP User Part Unavailable, Unequipped
     UPU-Inaccessible 0x6    MTP User Part Unavailable, Inaccessible

The ASP receiving the DUPU message is expected to follow the currently 
defined MTP3-User protocol reaction to an indication of remote user 
part unavailabilty.


2.3.3 Application Server Process Maintenance (ASPM) Messages

2.3.3.1 ASP Up (ASPUP)

The ASP-UP message is used to indicate to a remote M3UA peer that the 
Adaptation layer is ready to receive traffic or maintenance messages.

The ASPUP message contains the following parameters:

     Adaptation Layer Identifer (optional)
     SCN Protocol Identifier (optional)
     INFO String (optional)
     
The format for the ASPUP message is as follows:


    0            15 16           31

Internet Draft        SS7 MTP3-User Adaptation Layer          Oct 1999

The format and description of the optional Protocol Identifier and Info 
String parameters is the same as for the DUVA message (See Section 
2.3.2.1.)

The optional Adaptation Layer Identifier is a string that identifies 
the adaptation layer.  This string must be set to "M3UA" which results 
in a length of 4.  The ALI would normally only be used in the initial 
ASP Up message across a new SCTP association to ensure both peers are 
assuming the same adaptation layer protocol.

Note: Strings are padded to 32-bit boundaries.  The length field 
indicates the end of the string.

2.3.3.2 ASP Down (ASPDN)

The ASP-DN message is used to indicate to a remote M3UA peer that the 
adaptation layer is not ready to receive traffic or maintenance 
messages.

The ASPDN message contains the following parameters:

     INFO String (Optional)

The format for the ASPDN message is as follows:


    0            15 16           31

2.3.3.3 ASP Active (ASPAC)

The ASPAC message is sent by an ASP to indicate to an SG that it is 
the active ASP to be used from within a list of primary and back-up 
ASPs for a particular AS.

The ASPAC message contains the following parameters:

     INFO String (Optional)

The format for the ASPAC message is as follows:

2.3.3.4  ASP Inactive (ASPIA)

The ASPIA message is sent by an ASP to indicate to an SG that it is 
no longer the the active ASP to be used from within a list of primary 
and back-up ASP for a particular AS.  The SG will respond with an ASPIA 
message and either discard incoming messages or buffer for a timed 
period and then discard.

The ASPIA message contains the following parameters:

     INFO String (Optional)

The format for the ASPIA message is as follows:

3.0 Procedures

The M3UA layer needs to respond to various local primitives it receives 
from other layers as well as the messages that it receives from the 
peer M3UA layers.  This section describes the M3UA procedures in 
response to these events.

3.1 Procedures to support the M3UA services in Section 1.4.1

These procedures support the M3UA transport of MTP3-User/MTP3 boundary 
primitives.

3.1.1 Receipt of Local primitives

On receiving a primitive from the upper layer, the M3UA layer will 
send the corresponding ITUN or SSNM message (see Section 2) to its 
peer.  The M3UA layer must fill in various fields of the common and 
specific headers correctly.  In addition the message needs to be sent 
on the appropriate SCTP stream.

3.1.2 Receipt of ITUN or SSNM Messages from the Peer M3UA

On receiving ITUN or SSNM messages from the remote M3UA Peer, the M3UA 
layer invokes the appropriate primitive indications to the M3UA-User

3.2 Procedures to support the M3UA services in Section 1.4.2

3.2.1 Layer Management primitives procedures

On receiving these primitives from the local layer management, the M3UA 
layer will send the corresponding management message (Error) to its 
peer.  The M3UA layer must fill in the various fields of the common and 
specific headers correctly.

3.2.2 Receipt of Peer Management messages

Upon receipt of Management messages, the M3UA layer must invoke the 
corresponding Layer Management primitive indications (M-ERROR ind.) to 
the local layer management.


3.3 Procedures to support the M3UA services in Section 1.4.3


                                                                     21
Internet Draft        SS7 MTP3-User Adaptation Layer          Oct 1999

These procedures support the M3UA management of SCTP Associations and 
ASP Paths between SGs and ASPs

3.3.1 State Maintenance

The M3UA layer on the SG needs to maintain the state of each ASP as
well as the state of the related ASs.

3.3.1.1  ASP States

The state of each ASP is maintained in the M3UA layer in the SG. The 
state of an ASP changes due to events. The events include:

   * Reception of messages from peer M3UA layer
   * Reception of indications from the SCTP layer

The ASP state transition diagram is shown in Figure 4.  The possible 
states of an ASP are:

ASP-DOWN: The Application Server Process is unavailable.  Initially all 
ASPs will be in this state.

ASP-UP: The Application Server Process is available but application 
traffic is stopped.  

ASP-ACTIVE: The Application Server Process is available and application 
traffic is active.  At most one ASP per AS can be in the active state.

SCTP CDI: The local SCTP layer's Communication Down Indication to the   
Upper Layer Protocol (M3UA) on an SG. The local SCTP will send this 
indication when it detects the loss of connectivity to the ASP's SCTP 
layer.

3.3.1.2  AS States

The state of the AS is maintained in the M3UA layer on the SG.

The state of an AS changes due to events. These events include:

   * ASP state transitions
   * Recovery timer triggers

The possible states of an AS are:

AS-DOWN: The Application Server is unavailable.  This state implies 
that all related ASPs are in the ASP-DOWN state for this AS. Initially 
the AS will be in this state.

AS-UP: The Application Server is available but no application traffic 
is active (i.e., one or more related ASPs are in the ASP-UP state, but 
none in the ASP-Active state).

AS-ACTIVE: The Application Server is available and application traffic 
is active.  This state implies that one ASP is in the ASP-ACTIVE state.

AS-PENDING: The Active ASP has transitioned from active to inactive or 
down. A recovery timer T(r) will be started and all incoming SCN 
messages will be queued by the SG. If an ASP becomes active before T(r) 
expires, the AS will move to AS-ACTIVE state and all the queued 
messages will be sent to the active ASP. 

If T(r) expires before an ASP becomes active, the SG stops queuing 
messages and  discards all previously queued messages. The AS will move 
to AS-UP if at least one ASP is in ASP-UP state, otherwise it will move 
to AS-DOWN state.

3.3.2 ASPM procedures for primitives

Before the establishment of an SCTP association the ASP state at both 
the SG and ASP is assumed to be "Down".  

When the M3UA layer receives an M-SCTP ESTABLISH request primitive from 
the Layer Management, the M3UA layer will try to establish an SCTP 
association with the remote M3UA peer.  Upon reception of an eventual 
SCTP-Communication Up confirm primitive from the SCTP, the M3UA layer 
will invoke the primitive M-SCTP ESTABLISH confirm to the Layer 
Management.

Alternatively, if the remote M3UA-peer establishes the SCTP association 
first, the M3UA layer will receive an SCTP Communication Up indication 
primitive from the SCTP. The M3UA layer will then invoke the primitive 
M-SCTP ESTABLISH indication to the Layer Management. 

Once the SCTP association is established, The M3UA layer at an ASP will 
then find out the state of its local M3UA-user from the Layer 
Management using the primitive M-ASP STATUS.  Based on the status of 
the local M3UA-User, the local ASP M3UA Application Server Process 

                                                                     24
Internet Draft        SS7 MTP3-User Adaptation Layer          Oct 1999

Maintenance (ASPM) function will initiate the ASPM procedures, using 
the ASP-Up/-Down/-Active/-Inactive messages to convey the ASP-state to 
the SG - see Section 3.3.3. 

If the M3UA layer subsequently receives an SCTP-Communication Down 
indication from the underlying SCTP layer, it will inform the Layer 
Management by invoking the M-SCTP STATUS indication primitive. The 
state of the ASP will be moved to "Down" at both the SG and ASP.

At an ASP, the Layer Management may try to reestablish the SCTP 
association using M-SCTP ESTABLISH request primitive. 

3.3.3 ASPM procedures for peer-to-peer messages

3.3.3.1 ASP-Up
 
The SG will mark the path as up if an explicit ASP UP (ASPUP) message is
received and internally the path is allowed to come up (i.e., not in a
locked local maintenance state). An ASP UP (ASPUP) message will be sent
to acknowledge the received ASPUP. The SG will respond to a ASPUP with a
ASPDN message if the path is in a locked maintenance state.

The SG will send a ASPUP message in response to a received ASPUP message
from the MGC even if that path was already marked as UP at the SG.

The paths are controlled by the MGC. The SG will only send ASPUP in
response to the reception of a ASPUP message.

The MGC will send ASPUP messages every 2 (add text regarding this being
a configurable timer) seconds until the path comes up (i.e. until it
receives a ASPUP message from the SG for that path).  The MGC may decide
to reduce the frequency (say to every 5 seconds) if the an acknowledge-
ment is not received after a few tries.

The MGC should wait for the ASPUP message from the SG before transmitting
ASP maintenance messages (ASPIA or ASPAC) or M2UA messages or it will
risk message loss.  The ASPUP message received from the SG is not
acknowledged by the MGC.


3.3.3.2 ASP Down

The SG will mark the ASP as down and send a ASPDN message to the MGC if
one of the following events occur:

     - a ASP Down(ASPDN) message is received from the MGC,
     - the ASP is locked by local maintenance.

The SG will also send a ASPDN message when the ASP is already down and
a ASPDN) message is received from the MGC.

The MGC will send ASPDN whenever it wants to take down a ASP.  Since the
ASPDN messages to the SG or the ASPDN responses from the SG can be lost

                                                                     25
Internet Draft        SS7 MTP3-User Adaptation Layer          Oct 1999
 
(for example, during a MGC node failover), the MGC can send ASPDN messages
every 2 seconds until the path comes down (i.e. until it receives a ASPDN
message from the SG for that path).

3.3.3.3 ASP Version Control

If a ASP Up message with an unknown version is received, the receiving
end will respond with an Error message.  This will indicate to the
sender which version the receiving node supports.

This is useful when protocol version upgrades are being performed.  A
node with the newer version should support the older versions used on
other nodes it is communicating with.

The version field in the Error message header associated will indicate the 
version supported by the node.

3.3.3.4 ASP Active

When a ASP Active (ASPAC) message is received, the SG will start routing
to that ASP.  Reception of a ASPAC message overrides any previous ASPAC
messages and results in the ASP associated with the ASPAC message to
become the newly active ASP.

3.3.3.5 ASP Inactive

When a ASPIA message is received, message transmission to that ASP ceases.
The SG will either discard all incoming messages or start buffering the
incoming messages for T(r)seconds after which messages will be discarded.

If the ASP is down, all of the Paths that were supported by that ASP
are, by default, down.


4.0 Examples of M3UA Procedures

4.1 Establishment of associations between an SG and an ASP

An example of the message flows for establishing an active association 
between an SG and ASP is shown below.

                  SG                  ASP1
        
                        <----------- ASP Up
                  ASP Up ---------->
                  (ACK)
                        <----------- ASP Active
              ASP Active ---------->
              (ACK)

ASPs and the message flows for take-over of the primary (ASP1) by the 
secondary (ASP2).

                  ASP Up ---------->
                  (ACK)
                        <------------------------------ ASP Up
