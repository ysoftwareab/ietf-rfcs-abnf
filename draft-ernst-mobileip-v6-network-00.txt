Abstract

   This draft addresses the problems of routing datagrams to nodes
   located in an IPv6 mobile network. A mobile network is a network that
   is changing its point of attachment dynamically such as a network
   deployed in an aircraft, a boat, or a car. Mobile IPv6 [4] has been
   developed to support mobile nodes and is unable to support mobile
   networks efficiently.  This draft discusses the Mobile IPv6 ability
   to support mobile networks and proposes to extend Mobile IPv6 with
   prefix scope binding updates to support mobile networks in the
   Internet.  All datagrams bearing a destination address which prefix
   matches a home network prefix recorded in the binding cache are
   routed to the corresponding care-of address.

1. Introduction

   Mobile IPv4 [8] and Mobile IPv6 [4] have introduced mobility support
   for IPv4 and IPv6 [3] nodes respectively. The purpose of mobility
   support is to provide continuous Internet connectivity to mobile
   nodes. Mobile IP is a solution to support mobile nodes but does not
   handle mobile networks.

   There are situations where an entire network might move and attach to
   different places in the Internet topology. In this paper, we refer to
   a network as a set of nodes that share the same IP prefix and that
   are attached to the Internet through a single border router. We refer
   to a mobile network as a network whose border router is dynamically
   changing its point of attachment to the Internet and thus its
   reachability in the IP topology. The internal architecture of a
   mobile network is preserved while it is roaming. As such, nodes in
   the mobile network do not move with respect to the others and
   shouldn't take part in mobility management.

   Applications of mobile networks include networks attached to people
   (Personal Area Network or PANs) and networks of sensors deployed in
   aircrafts, boats, cars, trains, etc. As an example of a mobile
   network, we could imagine that an airways company provides permanent
   on-board Internet connectivity. This allows all passengers to use
   their laptops to connect to remote hosts, download music or video
   from any provider, or browse the web. The Internet could also be used
   to exchange information between the aircraft and air traffic control
   stations. During the flight, the aircraft changes its point of
   attachment to the Internet and is reachable by distinct IP addresses
   owned by distinct Internet service providers. This scenario justifies
   that mobile networks may be of a big size, containing hundreds of
   hosts and several routers and may attach to very distant parts of the
   Internet topology.

   Although the designers of Mobile IPv4 claim that it could support
   mobile networks equally as mobile nodes ([8] section 4.5, [9] section
   5.12, [7] section 11.2), we argue that this is not true for Mobile
   IPv6, which therefore requires some changes in the specification.
   Indeed, we have carefully studied the adequacy of Mobile IPv6 for
   supporting mobile networks and we came to the conclusion that some
   modifications are needed to support them.


2. Terminology

 2.1. General terms

      General terms are as defined in the Mobile IPv6 specification [4].

 2.2. Mobile Network terms

      Network
         A set of nodes that share the same IP prefix and that are
         attached to the Internet through a single border router

      Mobile Network
         A network whose border router is dynamically changing its point
         of attachment to the Internet and thus its reachability in the
         IP topology.

      Mobile Router (MR)
         The border router of the mobile network which attaches the
         mobile network to the rest of the Internet.

      Foreign Gateways (FGs)
         Subsequent points of attachment of the mobile network

      Mobile Network Node (MNN)
         Any host or router located within the mobile network.

      Correspondent Node (CN)
         External nodes corresponding with one or more MNNs of the
         mobile network.

      Mobile Network Prefix
         A bit string that consists of some number of initial bits of
         the home address of a mobile router, i.e the network prefix
         that is shared by both the Mobile Router and all the Mobile
         Network Nodes when the Mobile Router is attached on the home
         link.

      Figure 1 illustrates a mobile network attached to its home link.
      In figure 2, the mobile network has moved and is attached to a
      foreign link.


 2.3. Assumptions

      We make the assumption that the mobile network attaches to the
      Internet through only one mobile router and that this mobile
      router is not multihomed.  We also make the assumptions that nodes
      in the mobile network do not move with respect to the mobile
      router and are configured with a common and unique mobile network
      prefix.

3. Mobile IP and Mobile Networks

 3.1 Review of Mobile IP and Mobile Networks

      From the routing perspective, distinction between nodes is only
      necessary for routing inside the network. From outside, a network
      can be virtually perceived as a single node (the mobile router MR)
      with one address (or prefix) and n interfaces attached to it.
      According to this observation, the Mobile IPv4 specification
      proposes to support mobile networks as standard mobile nodes (see
      [8] section 4.5, [9] section 5.12, [7] section 11.2). In this
      situation, the mobile node is the border router MR of the mobile
      network. It has a permanent home address on its home link and gets
      a new care-of address at each subsequent point of attachment.  As
      any mobile node, it sends a Binding Update to its home agent HA to
      instruct it to intercept all datagrams intended for its MNNs.

      Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4 with Routing Optimization [11] could
      in theory support mobile networks similarly as in Mobile IPv4.
      However, although mentioned in the Mobile IPv4 specification, the
      current specifications of Mobile IPv4 with Routing Optimization
      and Mobile IPv6 don't mention them anymore.


 3.2. Inability of Mobile IPv6 to support mobile networks

  3.2.1. Registration with the Home Agent

         Obtaining a care-of address and requesting the HA to redirect
         in flight datagrams intended for the MR doesn't require
         modifications in the Mobile IPv6 specification as this could be
         done independently for a host or for a router.  However,
         although the HA is able to intercept datagrams intended to the
         MNNs, it is not able to encapsulate them to the care-of address
         of the Mobile Router.

         Once it receives a valid Binding Update, the Home Agent records
         in its Binding Cache the binding between the home address of
         the sender and its care-of address.  The home address is used
         as the key for searching the Binding Cache ([4] section 4.6).

         Datagrams reaching the home link and destined to a MNN are
         intercepted

          by the Home Agent because it claims to be the Mobile Router,
         i.e. the next hop towards the MNN. Then, the Binding Cache is
         searched for the destination address contained in the received
         datagram.  Unfortunately, at this point, the Home Agent is
         unable to find an entry since no binding bearing the
         destination address of the MNN is recorded in the Binding
         Cache.

         This is illustrated on figure 3 where CN sends a packet to
         MNN-1 (IP address FECA:700:AAAA:103C/64).  MR (home address
         FEC4:700:AAAA:1020/64) has registered its primary care-of
         address (FEC4:700:BBBB:202A/64) with its HA. The Binding
         between the home address and the care-of address of MR is
         recorded in the Binding Cache.  HA is therefore instructed to
         intercept all datagrams sent to MR.  The packet reaches HA
         because MR is the next hop towards the destination MNN-1.  HA
         searches its Binding Cache for an entry corresponding to
         destination address FECA:700:AAAA:103C/64 but does find any
         entry and drop the datagram.

  3.2.2 Registration with Correspondent Nodes

         Regarding the emission of Binding Updates to CNs, it makes
         sense that the node which is assigned the care-of address also
         sends Binding Updates. As a result, the Mobile Router would
         have to send a Binding Update on behalf of its MNNs, which has
         the benefit of hiding mobility of the network to the MNNs and
         frees them from any mobility management. Doing so while keeping
         MNNs out of any mobility management requires that the Mobile
         Router tracks the CNs of the MNNs and sends them Binding
         Updates.  Those datagrams require authentication. Piggybacking
         cannot be done by the Mobile Router without rewriting the AH or
         ESP header which may be present. Sending Binding Updates in
         separate datagrams requires that the Mobile Router uses the
         same security association as the MNN so that the CN accepts to
         send datagrams to the MNN via the careof-address of the Mobile
         Router. Both scenarios do not comply with IPv6 recommendations
         since no headers but the Routing extension (under some
         particular conditions) can be rewritten by routers along the
         path. We could think of mechanisms that would allow the Mobile
         Router to authenticate itself as one of its MNNs. But, although
         the Mobile Router and its MNNs are likely to trust each other
         and adopt the same administrative policy, it is not desirable
         to mislead the recipients since no node is authorized to send
         Binding Updates on behalf of a mobile node [4, section 10.8].

         To avoid these constraints, we may nevertheless consider that
         MNNs directly send Binding Updates to their CNs. This solution
         requires a mechanism to distribute the care-of address of the
         Mobile Router to all MNNs. They would consequently take part in
         mobility management. This approach is quite advantageous since
         the process of sending and authenticating Binding Updates is
         left unchanged. Binding Updates could be piggybacked or sent
         alone and are authenticated as coming from the MNNs. On the
         other hand, it requires changes of the Mobile IPv6 mobile node
         operation as MNNs do not need to perform the tasks of obtaining
         a careof address and registering it with a Home Agent.

         As we can see, both approaches have drawbacks and necessitate
         changes in the Mobile IPv6 specification.

         We also note that CNs may be communicating with several MNNs
         located in the same mobile network.  In this situation, they
         would redundantly record a binding containing the same care-of
         address for each MNN it is communicating with.


4. Mobile IPv6 enhancements to support mobile networks

   According to the observations made in section 3, we propose to
   enhance Mobile IPv6 with "prefix scope binding updates".  Instead of
   establishing a one-to-one relationship between a home address and a
   care-of-address, the binding establishes a many-to-one relationship
   between the set of nodes that share the same mobile network prefix
   and a care-of-address.  Prefix Scope Binding Updates are Binding
   Updates that associate a care-of address with the mobile network
   prefix instead of the full 128-bits IPv6 home address.  The mobile
   network prefix is used as a netmask in the Binding Cache.

   The Binding Update instructs its recipients to use the care-of
   address of the mobile router for all packets which destination is one
   MNN.

   Note that each CN only receives one copy of the Binding Update even
   if it communicates with several MNNs located in the same mobile
   network.

   This is performed by means of a new flag and a mobile network prefix
   carried in Binding Updates and recorded in the Binding Cache.  This
   only requires to redefine the procedure for searching the Binding
   Cache by both the Home Agent and the Correspondent Node.


 4.1. Packet Format of the Binding Update

      The format of the Binding Update is the same as defined in [4]
      except the Binding Update Option.  A new field "Prefix Scope
      Registration" is added and is taken from the "Reserved" field. In
      addition, the "Mobile Network Prefix" is a new sub-option that
      contains the mobile network prefix.

  4.1.1. New Binding Update Option format

         The Binding Update option is encoded in type-length-value (TLV)
         format as follows:

         Prefix Scope Registration (P)

            The Prefix Scope Registration (P) bit is set by the sending
            mobile node to request the receiving node to route all
            packets bearing a prefix (see section 4.1.2) set of initial
            bits in the destination address that matches the "Mobile
            Network Prefix" to the mobile router's careof address using
            a Routing Extension header.

         Rsrvd

            This field is reduced from a 4-bit field to a 3-bit field to
            account for the addition of the "Prefix Scope Registration"
            bit.  The remaining 3 bits are unused and MUST be
            initialized to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the
            receiver.

         The Mobile Network Prefix Sub-Option is valid only in the
         Binding Update destination Option if the "Prefix Scope
         Registration" (P) bit is set.  It is filled by the sending
         mobile node to request its Home Agent and its correspondent
         nodes to record a Prefix Scope entry in the Binding Cache (see
         section 4.2)

         The Prefix Length field is set to the (nonzero) length of the
         mobile network prefix.

         The Mobile Network Prefix field is set to the prefix of the
         mobile network.


 4.2. Cache Management

  4.2.1. Binding Cache entries

         Each Binding Cache entry contains the same fields as defined in
         [4].  However, the interpretation of the "Prefix Length" field
         is redefined and a new "Prefix Scope Registration" flag is
         added:

            - a flag "Prefix Scope Registration" indicating whether or
            not this Binding Cache entry represents a mobile router that
            is serving a mobile network.

            - the value of the "Prefix Length" field received in the
            Binding Cache that created or last modified this Binding
            Cache entry.  This field is only valid if the "Prefix Scope
            Registration" flag or the "Home Registration" flag is set on
            this Binding Cache entry.  If the "Prefix Scope
            Registration" flag is set, the "Prefix Length corresponds to
            the length of the mobile network prefix, otherwise the
            meaning is as defined in [4].

            - if the "Prefix Scope Registration" flag is set, the "home
            address" corresponds to the mobile network prefix.

  4.2.2. Searching the Binding Cache entries

         The Binding Cache is searched for an entry corresponding to the
         destination address of the packet.  The destination address is
         compared with the home address field of entries recorded in the
         Binding Cache.

         If the "Prefix Scope Registration" flag is set in the entry
         under comparison, the comparison is made between the "Prefix
         Length" set of initial bits of the destination address and the
         "home address" field.  If the prefix of the destination matches
         the mobile network prefix recorded in the entry, the
         destination is located in a mobile network.

         If the "Prefix Scope Registration" flag is not set, the
         comparison is made on the 128-bits addresses. If the

         destination address matches the home address, the destination
         is a mobile node.

         In both case, the care-of address of the corresponding entry is
         returned.

 4.3.  Enhanced Mobile IPv6 protocol operation

      The Mobile Node operation is enhanced to set the "P" to 1 and to
      fill the Mobile Network Prefix Sub-Option when it serves as the
      gateway of a mobile network.  It is also enhanced to send Binding
      Updates to all CNs that communicate with one of its MNNs.

      The Correspondent Node and the Home Agent operations are enhanced
      to process the "P" bit recorded in the Binding Update option and
      to transmit via the care-of address of the mobile router all
      datagrams bearing a destination address matching the mobile
      network prefix.

      The following sections only describe changes according to sections
      8, 9 and 10 of the Mobile IPv6 specification [4].


  4.3.1. Correspondent Node Operation

         Receiving Binding Updates

            Upon receiving a Binding Update, the CN performs validity
            checks as described in [4] section 8.2.  If the Binding
            Update is valid, the CN creates a new entry in its Binding
            Cache for this mobile node as it is performed in [4]. In
            addition, if the "Prefix Scope Registration" bit in the
            Binding Update Option is set, the CN received a Binding
            Update from a Mobile Router serving a mobile network.  In
            this case, the CN copies in the Binding Cache entry the
            "Prefix Scope Registration" bit from the Binding Update
            Option, the "Prefix Length" field from the Mobile Network
            Prefix Sub-Option, and the "Home Address" field from the
            Mobile Network Prefix" field in the Mobile Network Prefix
            Sub-Option.


         Sending Packets

            Before sending any packet, the sending node examine its
            Binding Cache for an entry for the destination address to
            which the packet is being sent (see section 4.2.2 "Searching
            the Binding Cache").  If the sending node has a Binding

INTERNET-DRAFT  Mobile Networks Support in Mobile-IPv6      14 July 2000


            Cache entry, the sending node uses a routing header to route
            the packet to the destination node by way of the care-of
            address in the binding recorded in that Binding Cache entry.


  4.3.2. Home Agent Operation

         Primary care-of address registration

            Upon receiving a Binding Update, the HA performs validity
            checks as described in [4] section 9.3.  If the Binding
            Update is valid, the HA creates a new entry in its Binding
            Cache for this mobile node as it is performed in [4].  This
            entry is used for intercepting packets for the mobile node.

            In addition, if the "Prefix Scope Registration" bit in the
            Binding Update Option is set, the HA received a Binding
            Update from a Mobile Router serving a mobile network.  In
            this case, the HA creates a second Binding Cache entry
            similar to the first one and copies the "Prefix Scope
            Registration" bit from the Binding Update Option, the
            "Prefix Length" field from the Mobile Network Prefix Sub-
            Option, and the "Home Address" field from the Mobile Network
            Prefix" field in the Mobile Network Prefix Sub-Option.  This
            second entry is used for encapsulating packets destined to
            any node of the mobile network.


         Intercepting Packets

         Datagrams sent by the CN to the IP address of the MNN are
         routed towards the home link of the mobile router where they
         are intercepted by the HA as specified in [4] section 9.5.

         Tunneling Intercepted Packets to a Mobile Node

         For any packet sent to a mobile node or a MNN for which the
         Home Agent is the original sender of the packet, the Home Agent
         is operating as a correspondent node and the procedures
         described in section 4.3.2 apply.  While acting as a Home
         Agent, the Home Agent intercepts any packet on the home link
         addressed to a mobile node or to a MNN. The Home Agent examines
         its Binding Cache for an entry for the destination address to
         which the packet is being sent (see section 4.2.2 "Searching
         the Binding Cache").  If the sending node has a Binding Cache
         entry, the Home Agent tunnels the packet to the care-of address
         recorded in that Binding Cache entry.

  4.3.3. Mobile Router Operation

         Sending Binding Updates

            Similarly to standard mobile nodes in the Mobile IPv6
            specification [4], the Mobile Router obtains a new care-of
            address at each of its subsequent points of attachment using
            either stateless or stateful DHCPv6 address
            autoconfiguration.

            A Mobile Router serving as a gateway to a mobile network
            sends a Binding Update datagram to its Home Agent as
            specified in [4] section 10.6.  In addition, it sets to "1"
            the Prefix Scope Registration" bit of the Binding Update
            Option and fills the "Prefix Length" and the "Mobile Network
            Prefix" fields of the Mobile Network Prefix Sub-Option.

            The Mobile Router learns the identity of its own CNs and CNs
            of its MNNs whenever it receives an encapsulated packet
            tunneled from its Home Agent.  It therefore sends a Binding
            Update to the sender of the packet as described in [4]
            section 10.8 and fills its Binding List accordingly.  In
            addition, it sets to "1" the Prefix Scope Registration" bit
            of the Binding Update Option and fills the "Prefix Length"
            and the "Mobile Network Prefix" fields of the Mobile Network
            Prefix Sub-Option.

5. Security Issues

   There is no security concern although the care-of address is used for
   a set of destinations and not only for the particular destination
   that sent the Binding Update.  Recipients of the prefix scope Binding
   Updates are not misled about the identity of its sender. The sender
   is clearly authenticated.

   We assume that the mobile router is somehow authenticated as a valid
   border router for the mobile network and is therefore allowed to send
   Binding Updates on behalf of the mobile network.
