sucvID = prfID(PublicKey, k)

sucvHID = prfHID(PublicKey, j)

sucvADDR = 64-bitPrefix + sucvHID

prfID = least significant 128 bits of:
                SHA-1 hash of the PublicKey concatenated with k.

prfHID = least significant 64 bits of:
                SHA-1 hash of the PublicKey concatenated with j,
                with bit 6 (the left-most bit is numbered 0) set to
                0.  This creates an interface identifier with local
                significance.

PublicKey = public key host identity as defined in HIP
