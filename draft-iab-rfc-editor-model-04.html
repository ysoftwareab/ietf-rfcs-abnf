<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
	The RFC Editor performs a number of functions that may be
	carried out by various persons or entities. The RFC Editor
	model presented in this document divides the responsibilities
	for the RFC Series into four functions: The RFC Series Editor,
	the Independent Submission Editor, RFC Production Center, and the RFC
	Publisher. The model outlined here is intended to increase
	flexibility and operational support options, provide for the
	orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and ensure the
	continuity of the RFC series, while maintaining RFC quality,
	maintaining timely processing, ensuring document
	accessibility, reducing costs, and increasing cost
	transparency.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
	The IAB, on behalf of the Internet technical community, is
	concerned with ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series,
	orderly RFC Editor succession, maintaining RFC quality, and
	RFC document accessibility. The IAB is also sensitive to the
	concerns of the IAOC about providing the necessary services in
	a cost effective and efficient manner.
      
</p>
<p>
	The definition of the RFC series is described in RFC 4844
	<a class='info' href='#RFC4844'>[1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Daigle, L. and Internet Architecture Board, &ldquo;The RFC Series and RFC Editor,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.  Section 3.1 defines "RFC Editor":
      
</p>
<p>
	</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
| 3.1. RFC Editor
|
|  Originally, there was a single person acting as editor of the RFC
|  Series (the RFC Editor).  The task has grown, and the work now
|  requires the organized activity of several experts, so there are RFC
|  Editors, or an RFC Editor organization.  In time, there may be
|  multiple organizations working together to undertake the work
|  required by the RFC Series.  For simplicity's sake, and without
|  attempting to predict how the role might be subdivided among them,
|  this document refers to this collection of experts and organizations
|  as the "RFC Editor".
|
|  The RFC Editor is an expert technical editor and series editor,
|  acting to support the mission of the RFC Series.  As such, the RFC
|  Editor is the implementer handling the editorial management of the
|  RFC Series, in accordance with the defined processes.  In addition,
|  the RFC Editor is expected to be the expert and prime mover in
|  discussions about policies for editing, publishing, and archiving
|  RFCs.
</pre></div><p>

      
</p>
<p>
	RFC 4844 makes no attempt to explore the internal organization
	of the RFC Editor. However, RFC 4844 envisions changes in the
	RFC Editor organizational structure.  In discussion with the
	Internet community, the IAB considered changes that increase
	flexibility and operational support options, provides for the
	orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and ensures the
	continuity of the RFC series, while maintaining RFC quality,
	maintaining timely processing, ensuring document
	accessibility, reducing costs, and increasing cost
	transparency. The model set forth below is the result of those
	discussions, and examines the internal organization of
	the RFC Editor, while remaining consistent with RFC 4844.
      
</p>
<p>
	Note that RFC 4844 uses the term "RFC Editor function" or "RFC
	Editor" as the collective set of responsibilities for which
	this memo provides a model for internal organization. This
	memo introduces the term "RFC Series Editor" or "Series
	Editor" for one of the organizational components.
      
</p>
<p>
        The IAB approved the RFC Editor model on October 1, 2008,
        based on a draft version of this this document which has
        received clarifications since. It should be noted that the
        publication of the document as an RFC does not cast the model
        in stone, as the primary purpose of this document, throughout
        the publication procession, is to encourgage normal community
        review in order to ascertain consensus to work to this model
        as a first step. The document, and the resulting structures,
        will be modified as needed through normal procedures. The IAB
        will continue to monitor discussions within the community
        about potential adjustments to the RFC Editor model and
        recognizes that the process described in this document, may
        need to be adjusted to align with any changes that result from
        such discussions, hence the version number in the title.

IAOC Implementation</h3>

<p>
	The model is constructed in such a way that it allows for all
	these functions to be implemented jointly or under separate
	contractual arrangements. In fact, a bidder could put together
	a proposal that includes one or more subcontractors. The
	reporting structure will depend on the manner that the
	contracts are awarded, and they are subject to change over
	time. As a result, the model describes only responsibilities,
	procedures, and process. The exact implementation is a
	responsibility of the IAOC.

<ul class="text">
<li>RFC Series Editor

<li>Independent Submission Editor
</li>
<li>RFC Production Center

<p>
	In this model the RFC Series Editor will exercise
	executive-level management over many of the activities of the
	RFC Publisher and the RFC Production Center (which can be seen
	as back office functions) and will be the entity that faces
	the community, and works with the IAB and IAOC for procedural
	and contractual responsibilities respectively while those
	entities maintain their chartered responsibility. The RFC
	Series Editor does not have the authority to hire or fire.
      
</p>
<p>
	If during the execution of their activities, a dispute arises
	over a (policy) decision made by one of the four entities in
	the model, then the party having the conflict should first
	request a reconsideration of the decision.  If that
	reconsideration is not satisfactory to the party, then the
	matter can be brought to the RFC Series Editor for a
	decision. If the RFC Series Editor decision is not
	satisfactory, the matter can be brought to the IAB, whose
	decision will be binding.. If the dispute is with the RFC
	Series Editor then there are only two stages: reconsideration
	and the IAB consideration.

RFC Series Editor</h3>

<p>
	 The RFC Series Editor, or Series Editor for short, is an individual
	 who may have assistants and who is responsible for:

	
</p>
<p>
	  </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Identifying appropriate steps for RFC Series
	    continuity
</li>
<li>
	      Exercise executive-level management over the
	      implementation of policies, processes and procedures
	      established to ensure the quality and consistency fo the
	      RFC Series.  The RFC Series Editor will work with the
	      IAB and IAOC to develop new policy and see that
	      contractual agreements are met.
	    
</li>
<li>
	     Taking proposed changes to the community, and work with
	     the IAB so that the IAB can ensure that there is
	     sufficient community review before the policy is adopted.
	    
</li>
<li>
	      Coordinating with IAB and/or IAOC, and together with the
	      IAB and/or IAOC participating in reviews of the RFC
	      Publisher, RFC Publication Center, and Independent
	      Stream Editor functions to ensure the above mentioned
	      continuity
	    
</li>
<li>
	      Developing, maintaining, and publishing the RFC Style
	      Manual publication for use by authors, editors, and the
	      RFC publisher
	    
</li>
<li>Managing the RFC errata process
</li>
<li>Liaising with the IAB
</li>
<li> Overseeing consistency of RFCs with the RFC Series and RFC Style Manual
</li>
</ol><p>
	
</p>
<p>
	  There are many potential issues with respect to RFC Series
	  continuity. To name a few: Look and feel of the series,
	  indexing methodologies, accessibility of the publications,
	  IPR and copyright issues, and formatting issues.  After
	  identifying the appropriate steps to address such issues,
	  the implementation of those steps resides mostly with the
	  RFC production and publishing functions. Since the IAOC
	  maintains oversight of the implementation, the Series Editor
	  is expected to be invited and participate in reviews of that
	  implementation.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The RFC Series Editor is a senior technology professional
	  with the following qualifications:
	  </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Strong understanding of the IETF process
</li>
<li>Good understanding of the English language and technical
	    terminology related to the Internet
</li>
<li>Good communication skills
</li>
<li>Experience with editorial processes
</li>
<li>Independent worker
</li>
<li>Experience as an RFC author desired
</li>
</ol><p>
	
</p>
<p>
	  The Series Editor may seek support from an advisory board
	  (see <a class='info' href='#editorial_board'>Section&nbsp;3.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>RFC Editorial Board</span><span>)</span></a>).
	
</p>
<p>
	  The IAOC has two alternative selection methods for selecting
	  the individual to serve as the RFC Series Editor. The choice
	  between these alternatives will be based on an Request for
	  Information (RFI) issued by the IAOC in December 2009.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The first alternative involves a Request for Proposal (RFP)
	  process run by the IAOC. The IAOC would seek a person with
	  the listed qualifications in a broadly distributed RFP. The
	  winner would be selected by the IAOC in consultation with
	  the IAB, and then, the IAOC would contract for the
	  services. Contract terms, including length of contract,
	  extensions and renewals, shall be as provided in the
	  RFP. The opportunity to bid shall be broadly available. Fees
	  and expenses to support the administrative operation of the
	  RFC Series Editor would be part of the awarded contract and
	  be part of the IASA budget.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The second alternative involves a nomination and
	  confirmation process. Candidates are nominated, and then an
	  individual with the listed qualifications is selected by the
	  Internet community and confirmed by the IAB. An approach
	  similar to the one used by the IAB to select an IAOC member
	  every other year as described in <a class='info' href='#selection'>Appendix&nbsp;A<span> (</span><span class='info'>IAB selection</span><span>)</span></a>
	  will be used. A stipend and expenses to support the
	  administrative operation of the RFC Series Editor selected
	  in this manner would be part of the IASA budget.

Independent Submission Editor</h3>

<p>
	  The Independent Submission Editor is an individual who may
	  have assistants and who is responsible for:
	
</p>
<p>
	  </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Maintaining technical quality of the Independent stream
</li>
<li>Independent Submissions approval and processing
</li>
<li>Forwarding RFCs in the Independent Stream to the RFC Production Center
</li>
<li>Independent Submissions RFC errata review and approval
</li>
</ol><p>
	
</p>
<p>
	  The Independent Submission Editor is a senior position for
	  which the following qualifications are desired:
	
</p>
<p>
	  </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Technical competence, i.e. broad technical experience
	    and perspective across the whole range of Internet
	    technologies and applications, and specifically, the
	    ability to work effectively with portions of that spectrum
	    in which no personal expertise exists.
</li>
<li>Thorough familiarity with the RFC series
</li>
<li>An ability to assess the technical competence of
	    potential Editorial Board members
</li>
<li>Good standing in the technical community, in and beyond
	    the IETF
</li>
<li>Demonstrated Editorial skills and good command of the English language 
</li>
</ol><p>

	  The Independent Submission Editor may seek support from an
	  advisory board (see <a class='info' href='#editorial_board'>Section&nbsp;3.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>RFC Editorial Board</span><span>)</span></a>) and may
	  form a team to perform the activities needed to fulfill their
	  responsibilities.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The individual with the listed qualifications will be
	  selected by the community and confirmed by the IAB. An
	  approach similar to the one used by the IAB to select an
	  IAOC member every other year as described in <a class='info' href='#selection'>Appendix&nbsp;A<span> (</span><span class='info'>IAB selection</span><span>)</span></a> should be used. A stipend and expenses
	  to support the administrative operation of the Independent
	  Submission Editor selected in this manner will be
	  evaluated. The IAB considers maintaining the Independent
	  stream within the RFC Series part of the IAB's supported
	  activities, and will include these expenses in its
	  IASA-supported budget.

</p>
<p>

<ol class="text">
<li>Editing inputs from all RFC streams to comply with the
	  RFC Style Manual
</li>
<li>Creating records of edits performed on documents
</li>
<li>Identifying where editorial changes might have technical

	  needed.
	  
</li>
<li>Creating records of dialogue with documents authors

<li>Requesting advice from the RFC Series Editor as needed
</li>
<li>Providing suggestions to the RFC Series Editor as needed
</li>
<li>Coordinating with IANA to perform protocol paramater
	  registry actions
</li>
<li>Assigning of RFC number
</li>
<li> Establishing publication readiness of each document
	  through communication with the authors, document shepherds,
	  IANA and/or stream dependent contacts, and if needed with
	  the RFC Series Editor.  
</li>
<li>Forwarding ready-to-publish documents to the RFC

<p>
      The RFC Production Center contractor is to be selected by the
      IAOC through an RFP process, possibly as part of the same
      contract as the RFC Series Editor. The IAOC would seek a bidder
      who, among other things, is able to provide a professional,
      quality, timely, and cost effective service against the
      established style and production guidelines. Contract terms,
      including length of contract, extensions and renewals, shall be
      as defined in an RFP. The opportunity to bid shall be broadly
      available.

<p>
      Implementation of the RFC Publisher function can be pursued in

</p>
<p>
      The first alternative is to modify the IETF Secretariat contract
      to include these services. Expenses to support these services
      would be part of the revised contract.
    
</p>
<p>
      The second alternative is a separate vendor selected by the IAOC
      through an RFP process, possibly as part of the same contract as

<p>
	Today the RFC Editor is supported by an Editorial Board. This

IANA considerations</h3>

<p>
      This document defines several functions within the overall
      RFC  Editor structure, and it places the responsibility for
      coordination of registry value assignments with the RFC
      Production Center. The IAOC will facilitate the establishment
      of the relationship between the RFC Production Center and IANA.
    
</p>
<p>
      This document does not create a new registry nor does it
      register any values in existing registries, and no IANA action
      is required.

<a name="rfc.section.5"></a><h3>5.&nbsp;
Security considerations</h3>

<p>
      The same security considerations as those in RFC 4844 apply: The
      processes for the publication of documents must prevent the
      introduction of unapproved changes. Since the RFC Editor
      maintains the index of publications, sufficient security must be
      in place to prevent these published documents from being changed
      by external parties. The archive of RFC documents, any source
      documents needed to recreate the RFC documents, and any
      associated original documents (such as lists of errata, tools,
      and, for some early items, non-machine readable originals) need
      to be secured against failure of the storage medium and other
      similar disasters.
    
</p>
<p>
     The IAOC should take these security considerations into
     account during the implementation of this RFC Editor model.

<p>
      The RFC Editor model was conceived and discussed in hallways and
      on mail lists. The first iteration of the text on which this
      document is based was first drafted by Leslie Daigle, Russ
      Housley, and Ray Pelletier.  In addition to the members of the
      IAOC and IAB, major and minor contributions were made by (in
      alphabetical order): Bob Braden, Brian Carpenter, Sandy Ginoza,
      Alice Hagens, Joel M. Halpern, Paul Hoffman, John Klensin, Subramanian Moonesamy,
      and Jim Schaad.
    
</p>
<p>
      The IAOC members at the time the RFC Editor model was approved
      were (in alphabetical order):
        Fred Baker,
        Bob Hinden,
        Russ Housley,
        Ole Jacobsen,
        Ed Juskevicius,
        Olaf Kolkman,
        Ray Pelletier (non-voting),
        Lynn St.Amour, and
        Jonne Soininen.
      In addition, Marshall Eubanks was serving as the IAOC Scribe.
    
</p>
<p>
      The IAB members at the time the RFC Editor model was approved
      were (in alphabetical order):
        Loa Andersson,
        Gonzalo Camarillo,
        Stuart Cheshire,
        Russ Housley,
        Olaf Kolkman,

        Kurtis Lindqvist,
        Andrew Malis,
        Danny McPherson,
        David Oran,
        Dave Thaler, and
        Lixia Zhang.
      In addition, the IAB included two ex-officio members: Dow Street, who
      was serving as the IAB Executive Director, and Aaron Falk, who was

      This process is used by the IAB for the selection of the RFC
      Series Editor (if that position is not covered by the RFC
      Production Center contract) and for the selection of the
      Independent Submission Editor. The IAOC selects the RFC
      Production Center and RFC Publisher from vendors that choose to submit
      a proposal.  The IAOC procurement process is not described in
      this document.
    
</p>
<p>The selection process herein is taken from <a class='info' href='#RFC4333'>[2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huston, G. and B.

Term of Office and Selection Time Frame</h3>

<p>
	  The IAB will seat their selected member at the first IETF
	  meeting of every second year, for a two-year term of office.
	  Basic time frame requirements for the selection process are
	  as follows:
	  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>3-4 weeks for solicitation of nominations.
</li>
<li>3-4 weeks for review of nominees, deliberation, and selection.
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p>

	  that year, following the guidelines above.

Section 00->01</h3>

<p>Added Sandy and Alice to the acknowledgement section, they were accidentally omitted
</p>
<p>
	  Added <a class='info' href='#selection'>Appendix&nbsp;A<span> (</span><span class='info'>IAB selection</span><span>)</span></a> so that the selection
	  mechanism is explicitly documented. The selection mechanism
	  documents the use of an advisory committee and is explicit
	  about the fact that the community expands beyond the IETF
	  community.

	
</p>
<p>
	  Modified the RFC Editor Function name to "RFC Series Editor"
	  in order to minimize confusion between the collective of
	  functions (RFC Editor) and the function (Series Editor).
	
</p>
<p>
	  Added wording for specifying the technical competence needed
	  by the indep.subm.editor as suggested by JCK
	
</p>
<p>
	  Clarified the responsibilities of the production function in
	  <a class='info' href='#production'>Section&nbsp;3.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>RFC Production Center</span><span>)</span></a>

Section 01->02</h3>

<p>Various nits corrected

<p>Inconsictency in the use of RFC Production house and RFC
	Production fixed: RFC Production Center used as term
</p>
<p>
	  Oversight over RFC consistency with the style manual has been made explicit.
</p>
<p>
	   Clarified that the Independent Stream Editors budget is
	   independent from the IETF/IASA.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Improved the language that clarified that the RFC Series
	  editors and Independent Stream editor do not necessarilly
	  need to work  without assistants, while they bear the responsibility.

Section 02->03</h3>

<p> Added Joel to the acknowledgements
</p>
<p> Added the Advisory comittee charter as a FYI
</p>
<p>Added editorial skill and command of English as a requirement for the ISE
</p>
<p>In the responsibilities for the RFC series: Change
	"Participate in" to "Provide input in" for IAOC Review. This
	makes the text more implementation neutral.
</p>
<p>Typo: Model is consistent with RFC4844 instead of 4884
</p>
<p>Added "Maintaining technical quality of the Independent
	stream" as an explicit responsibility for the ISE.
