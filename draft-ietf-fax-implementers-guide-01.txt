3. Implementation Issues Specific to Simple Mode

3.1 Simple Mode Fax Senders

3.1.1 Multipart/alternative

Although a requirement of MIME compliance (see RFC 2046, Section 5.1.4), some email client implementations are not capable of correctly processing messages with a MIME Content-Type of "multipart/alternative". If a sender is unsure if the recipient is able to correctly process a message with a Content-Type of "multipart/alternative", the sender should assume the worst and not use this MIME Content-Type.

In the absence of a standard mechanism to determine the recipient's capabilities, a sender should avoid sending multipart/alternative. At this time there is not standard mechanism to determine this capability in a recipient.


3.2 Simple Mode Fax Receivers

3.2.1 Multipart/alternative and Storage Capacity

Devices with little storage capacity are unable to cache previous parts of a multipart/alternative message.  In order for such devices to correctly process only one part of a multipart/alternative message, such devices may simply use the first process-able part of a multipart/alternative message. This is viable because the parts within a multipart/alternative are always sent in least-fidelity to most-fidelity order. 

This behavior means that even if subsequent, higher-fidelity parts may have been process-able they will not be used.  

This behavior can cause user dissatisfaction because when two (high-fidelity but) low-memory devices are used with each other, the lowest-fidelity part of the multipart/alternative will be processed.

The solution to this problem is for the sender to determine the capability of the recipient. However a mechanism to determine the recipient capabilities prior to an initial message sent to the recipient doesn't yet exist on the Internet.

The Extended Mode mechanism described in RFC 2532 [3], Section 3.3 enables a recipient to include its capabilities in a confirmation notice, in a DSN if the recipient device is an RFC 2532/ESMTP compliant server or in an MDN if the recipient is only an UA.

Internet draft                   Implementers Guide              9 March 2000


4. Implementation Issues Specific to Extended Mode

4.1 Multipart/Alternative

     Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 are also applicable to this mode.

4.2. Correlation of MDN with Original Message

     To re-iterate a paragraph from section 2.1, RFC 2298 [9], it is
     included here:

	A message that contains a Disposition-Notification-To header SHOULD
      also contain a Message_ID header as specified in RFC 822 [?]. This 
      will permit automatic correlation of MDNs with original messages by
      user agents.

4.3 Correlation of DSN with Original Message

Similar to the requirement to correlate an MDN, above, DSNs also need to be correlated. This is best done using the ENVID parameter in the "MAIL" command. See Sections 3 and 5.4 of RFC 1891 [5] for details.


4.4 Extended Mode Receivers

4.4.1 Confirmation of receipt and processing

Confirmation that the facsimile image (TIFF-FX attachment) was delivered and successfully processed is an important aspect of the extended mode of facsimile using Internet mail. Implementers of the Extended Mode [3] should provide consistency in the feedback provided to senders in the form of error codes and/or failure/successful messages.

4.4.1.1 Discrepancies in MDN [7] Interpretation

The value of receiving an acknowledgement of 'processability' from 
an Extended Mode recipient is the success or failure to process the
TIFF-FX file attachment. The attachment constitutes the facsimile
message and not the body-content of the message. Therefore a
Extended Mode sender would expect, and it is recommended, that the
Extended Mode receiver responds with a MDN to indicates the success
or failure to decode and process the TIFF-FX file attachment.

An Extended Mode sender must be aware that RFC 2298 [7] does not make
this distinction and consequently MDNs may be received which do not
associate the feedback information to the attached TIFF-FX file but
to the body-content part of the message.

Internet draft                   Implementers Guide              9 March 2000


4.4.2 Extended Mode Receivers which are MTAs (or ESMTP servers)

NOTE: There are no new definitions here. This section explains
      how to use DSN and status code for ESMTP server devices.

      It is strongly encouraged that SMTP server-based implementations should implement "SMTP Service Extension for Returning Enhanced Error Codes" [6]. This standard is easy to implement and it allows detailed standardized success and error indications to be returned to the sender by the submitting MTA. 

4.4.2.1 Examples for Receivers which are MTAs (or ESMTP servers) 

These examples are provided as illustration only. They should not be interpreted as limiting the protocol or the DSN form.
If examples conflict with the definitions (RFC 1891/1893/1894/2034), the example is wrong. The definitions are not superseded here.


a) Success Case

In the following example the sender <jean@water.line.com> sends a message to receiver <ifax@water.line.com> which is an ESMTP server and the receiver successfully decodes the message.

SMTP Sequence:

   S: 220 copper.point.com SMTP service ready
   C: EHLO water.line.com
   S: 250-copper.point.com
   S: 250-DSN
   S: 250 ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES
   C: MAIL FROM:<jean@water.line.com> RET=HDRS ENVID=MM123456
   S: 250 2.1.0 Originator <jean@water.line.com> ok
   C: RCPT TO:<ifax@water.line.com> NOTIFY=SUCCESS,FAILURE
   S: 250 2.1.5 Recipient <ifax@water.line.com> ok
   C: DATA
   S: 354 Send message, ending in CRLF.CRLF.
    ...
    ...
    ...
   C: .
   S: 250 2.0.0 Message accepted
   C: QUIT
   S: 221 2.0.0 Goodbye

   --JUK199912121854870001
   Content-type: text/plain;

   Your message (id MM123456) was successfully delivered to
   ifax@water.line.com.

   --JUK199912121854870001
   Content-type: message/delivery-status

   Reporting-MTA: dns; copper.point.com

   --JUK199912121854870001--




b) Failure Case 1

In this example the receiver is unable to decode the attached file AFTER receiving the complete message.

SMTP Sequence:

This is the same as the case a). After the sequence, a decode error occurs at the receiver.

   --JUK199912121934240002
   Content-type: text/plain;

   Your message (id MM123456) to ifax@water.line.com resulted in an error
   in attempt to decode the attached file.

c) Failure Case 2

In this example the receiver is unable to decode the attached file BEFORE receiving the complete message.

SMTP sequence:

   S: 220 copper.point.com SMTP service ready
   C: EHLO air.rect.com
   S: 250-copper.point.com
   S: 250-DSN
   S: 250 ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES
   C: MAIL FROM:<jean@water.line.com> RET=HDRS ENVID=MM123456
   S: 250 2.1.0 Originator <jean@water.line.com> ok
   C: RCPT TO:<ifax@water.line.com> NOTIFY=SUCCESS,FAILURE
   S: 250 2.1.5 Recipient <ifax@water.line.com> ok
   C: DATA
   S: 354 Send message, ending in CRLF.CRLF.
    ...
    ... (the attached file cannot be decoded by receiver)
    ...
   C: .
   S: 554 5.6.1 Media not supported
   C: QUIT
   S: 221 2.0.0 Goodbye

DSN:

Note: The previous MTA then generates the DSN that is forwarded to the original sender. A receiving UA can not generate a DSN.


4.4.3 Extended Mode Receivers which are POP3/IMAP4

NOTE: There are no new definitions here. The definitions of disposition-types
      and disposition-modifiers are defined in RFC 2298[7]. This section
      explains how POP3/IMAP4 devices may use the already defined values.

When a message is received with the Disposition-Notification-To header,
And the receiver has determined if the message is process-able, it may generate 
a (negative confirmation) MDN in case of error or a (positive confirmation) MDN if the MDN is requested by the sender. 

a) Success case

If the original sender receives MDNs which have "displayed", "dispatched" or "processed" disposition-type without disposition-modifier, the receiver may have possibly received or decoded the attached TIFF-FX file that it sent. It does not guarantee that the receiver displays, print or save the attached TIFF-FX file See Section 4.4.1.1, Discrepancies in MDN Interpretation.



Cancio, Moldovan, Tamura         Work-in-progress                   [Page 9]
Internet draft                   Implementers Guide              1 March 2000


b) Failure case

If the original sender receives an MDNs with an "error" or "warning" disposition-modifier, it is possible that the receiver could not receive or decode the attached TIFF-FX file. [[[Currently there is not way to associate the disposition-type with the handling of the main body of the message or the attached TIFF-FX file]]].


4.4.3.1 Examples

These examples are provided as illustration only. They should not be interpreted as limiting the protocol or the MDN form. If examples conflicts with the MDN definition[7], the example are wrong.

a) Success example

   NOTE: The third component of this MDN is not here. It is optional.

5. Implementation Issues Specific to the File Format

5.1 IFD Placement in TIFF file & Profile S Constraints

Low memory devices, which support resolutions greater than the required Profile-S may be memory-constrained such that those devices cannot properly handle arbitrary placement of TIFF IFDs within a TIFF file.

To interoperate with a receiver that is constrained, it is strongly recommended that senders always place the IFD at the beginning of the TIFF-FX file when using any of the Profiles defined in RFC 2301.


5.2 Precautions for implementers of RFC 2301 [4]
	
Interoperability testing of the File Format for Internet Fax [4] yielded useful 


Cancio, Moldovan, Tamura         Work-in-progress                   [Page 11]
Internet draft                   Implementers Guide              9 March 2000

information that may help developers avoid the same mistakes.
The following compiled list of TIFF/RFC 2301 [4] errors where encountered during interoperability testing and is provided so that implementers can take precautionary measures.

5.2.1 Typical Reader Errors in Headers

    a) Although Profile S in TIFF-FX requires little-endian, readers implementing profiles other than Profile-S may be constrained and only read little-endian, even when the specifications permits encoding in both little-endian and big-endian.
Consequently, implementers generating big-endian order (bytes 0-1 equal to 4D4Dh) should be aware of potential interoperability problems with such constrained receivers.
	 
    b) TIFF Readers should not expect that the byte order (bytes 0-1 of the        Image File Header) be equal to only "II"(4949h) or "MM"(4D4Dh). They should be able to accept other values and exit gracefully.

    c) Implementers should not expect that the "magic number" (bytes 2-3 of
       the Image File Header) be equal to 42 (2Ah) -- other values were
       found during testing.

    d) Implementers should be careful of the first IFD offset pointing beyond
       the end of the TIFF-FX file.

    e) Implementers should be aware that the first IFD offset is not always
       found on a word boundary.


5.2.2 Typical IFD Errors

    a) Implementers should be cautious when generating a TIFF profile with
       a second or third IFD. They should make sure that the offsets for the
       extra IFDs do not point outside the file.

    b) Implementers should be careful not to overlap the IFDs with other
       TIFF profile data such as strip image data or header data.

    c) Implementers should be aware that some readers have difficulties
       handling TIFF profiles with the following IFD positions: IFD at
       the end of the profile, IFD intercalated with another IFD data like
       XResolution, DateTime, strip image data, etc.

    d) Implementers should be aware that some legacy readers have difficulties
       handling profiles that have child IFDs. There is a high probability
       that some of these readers will have trouble accessing all the child IFDs
       
    e) Implementers should also be aware that some readers do not recognize the
       GlobalParametersIFD).

5.2.3 IFD Entry Errors

   Implementers should make sure when generating a TIFF profile that:

   a) All entries exist. Missing entries make it impossible to read the
      image data.

   b) Tags will not have two types of data (for example SHORT or LONG).

   c) Tags do not have the wrong type of data (for example RATIONAL instead
      of SRATIONAL. 

   d) The count of type is correct for a specified tag (it is not null and
      the matches the tag ID)

   e) Tags appear in the right order in the IFD.

   f) Tags as PageNumber or ImageLayer have values that match the number
      of IFDs or the image data.

   g) Tags are unique within an IFD.
 
5.2.4 Strip Errors

    Implementers should make sure when generating a TIFF profile that:

    a) Strip data is not overlapped with another file data

    b) The strip offset does not point outside file

    c) The strip length is not null or the strip offset + strip length
       does not point outside file

    d) There is only one bit order (not more) specified for data storing.

5.2.5 Image Errors

   a) Implementers should be cautious when generating a TIFF profile that the type of image tags and the data from the strip data match. (e.g. If in case of a 
B&W image, the PhotometricInterpretation tag value is 0 (bit 0 means white) the image will appear inverted).

   b) Implementers should be cautious when generating a TIFF profile that for the special color spaces (ITULAB, YCBCR, CMYK) the parameters used for transformations are correct and compliant to the specification. 

   c) Implementers should make sure when generating a TIFF profile that the tag values for XPosition and YPosition are correct.

5.2.6 Profile Specific Errors
    
   a) Implementers should make sure when generating a TIFF profile that all combinations of tag values are correct. Special attention should be given to the sets: XResolution, YResolution and ImageWidth and PhotometricInterpretation, SamplesPerPixel, and BitsPerSample.

   b) Implementers should make sure when generating a TIFF profile M that the compression used for the layers is correct. Typical errors are for the Mask layer not be compressed with a black and white compression and the Background and Foreground layer not to be compressed with a color compression.


6. Implementation Issues for Internet Fax Addressing

TBD  [[[ Section will be removed if not needed ]]]


7. Known Open Implementation Issues

7.1 Email and Traditional Facsimile Headers

In reference to the TIFF Encoded images generated in the general case where the end to end transmission is all Internet mail and there is no onramp or offramp to the GSTN.

Should senders rasterize the classic time/date, page number or CSID data into the TIFF page image before the SMTP transmission to preserve the "look and feel" and general end user expectations of what a "fax" looks like?


8. Security considerations

With regards to this document, Sections 5 in RFC 2305 [2] and Section 4 in RFC 2532 [3] apply.
