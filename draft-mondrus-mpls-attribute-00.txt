Abstract

This document proposes an additional attribute to identify MPLS-capable
interfaces. When this attribute is used, it allows the source-head of
MPLS tunnel to identify MPLS topology for source-route calculation. This
document does not specify any protocol changes.

It is important to emphasize that proposed technique is relatively
simple and relies on existing IGPs and MPLS signaling protocols.

1. Introduction

When MPLS signaling sets up a LSP, it uses layer-3 topology, so if the
source-head of a LSP calculates the source-route to a destination, it
does not take into an account if the IP interface is MPLS-capable.

When MPLS-capable attribute is used, it allows to automatically detect
the IP interfaces which support MPLS. Therefore, a network administrator
could rely on this feature to identify the MPLS topology.

The proposed attribute would be flooded using an IGP. Both IS-IS and
OSPF can be used for this purpose.

2. Architectural proposal

Let's assume a network X consists of a Y number of IP devices. Let's
also assume that a network administrator configures only portion of his
IP topology to use label forwarding.

Mondrus                                                        [Page 1]

On this network X, an IGP conveys all constraint routing (CR) attributes
required for the source-head to calculate a LSP path to a particular
destination. One of the flooded attributes is MPLS-capable attribute.

When the source-head of a LSP receives the CRs, it should be able to
determine the MPLS topology. So if there is requirement to identify MPLS
topology, the MPLS-capable attribute could be a good candidate for this
purpose.

Based on the pruned CR topology, the source-routed path can be
calculated at the source-head, so MPLS signaling should be forwarded to
MPLS capable interfaces.
