Abstract

This document extends the definition of Interior Location defined in
draft-rosen-geopriv-pidf-interior to include a set of registered
elements that allow for the expression of relative location.  The
expression of relative location enables LAN technologies that have such
capability to provide a more accurate location description than normally
allowed using [RFC4776] [RFC5139].  By registering the elements
described here, interoperability between applications and vendors is
enabled.

1. Introduction

   This extension to the definition of interior locations is a set of
   registered elements that provide a common method to express
   additional location information in the form of a relative location
   from a reference location.

   The relative location information could be produced by LAN
   technologies and used in environments such as large campus networks,
   large public buildings, hot spots, etc.

   Using geodetic coordinates to describe the location of an entity has
   limitations that restrict its usability, especially in indoor
   environments. In these cases, describing the determined location of
   the entity using civic and relative addressing may be both more
   feasible and easier for human consumption than using geodetic
   coordinates.


1.1. Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.

1.2. Motivation for Interior Location

   Current civic addressing [RFC4776],[RFC5139] is neither granular nor
   accurate enough to be able to describe an arbitrary indoor position
   of a network device with precision. This document proposes to extend
   civic addressing with a reference point, an offset and relative
   location from these points using shapes in the Cartesian coordinate
   system to describe the position of a network device. The data
   included within the relative position parameters is supplementary to,
   not exclusive of the existing civic location data expressed in PIDF-
   LO [RFC4119] and the DHCP Civic Location option [RFC4776] [RFC5139].

   An example of this may be a 4-story campus building belonging to a
   company that has wireless LAN technology deployed throughout the
   building. The building has complete RF coverage and the wireless
   network architecture for the building can locate network devices
   within that building to within a few meters using RF measurements or
   other technologies. The supplementary data provided by relative
   location would enable a more granular location expression for a
   located device. In addition to "34 Some Street, Anytown, PA, USA,
   Building 10, Floor 4", a relative position "within X meters of the
   point which is 10 meters south and 15 meters east of the main
   elevator on Floor 4" is possible.

   Another example of this may be a popular wireless hotspot located at
   234 N. Main St., Anytown, PA. USA.  It is reasonable to expect that

Internet-Draft         INT Location Extensions             October 2009


   234 N. Main St. covers a geographic area that encompasses several
   hundred square meters.  The wireless network architecture for this
   hotspot could include several wireless infrastructure access points.
   The supplementary data provided via relative location would enable a
   more granular location expression.  In addition to providing 234 N.
   Main St., Anytown, PA. USA, a relative position like "within X meters
   from the main entrance" could be added.

2. INT Elements

   Included in the interior relative location architecture below is a
   set of INT elements and corresponding attributes that are registered
   with the namespace to enable interoperability between various vendors
   and devices.  Included are 4 shapes: point, circle, arcband, and
   polygon.  Mixing the use of these registered INT elements with any
   quantity of local, or private, INT elements is allowed. Please note
   that all INT elements are supplementary to Civic location elements in
   PIDF-LO.  The order in which these new elements appear in PIDF-LO is
   significant based on the text for each shape below.

2.1. Measurement Uncertainty

   When calculating a network device's location using the technology
   described above, there is an area of uncertainty associated with the
   measurement techniques.  The method of expressing a calculated
   position and separately expressing the area of uncertainty has been
   debated as to its usefulness.  Hence, there is no facility included
   here to allow the expression of an area of uncertainty separate from
   the shape.  It is expected that the expressed shape will include the
   area of uncertainty, to yield a result that the device is contained
   within the shape to a 95% confidence level.

2.2. Reference Location

   Measurement from the reference is provided by using the labels of X,
   Y and Z.  The east-west dimension is labeled X and north-south
   dimension is labeled Y.  A positive Y value is considered north of
   the reference, a negative Y value south of the reference, a positive
   X value for east of the reference and a negative X value indicates
   west of the reference. The height value, Z, is optional.  A positive
   Z value would indicate the height above the floor level at the
   reference whereas a negative Z value would indicate a height below
   the reference.  The absence of a Z value indicates the shape is at
   the floor level of the reference or unknown.  All position values are
   in meters.

3. Shapes

   The different shapes are described by first declaring a mandatory
   reference element, which is the starting location for the offset
   positions.  Next is a mandatory declaration of the shape type, which
   includes point, circle, arcband, or polygon.  Following the shape
   declaration element are the shape specific offset measurement
   elements as outlined below.

3.1. Point

   The point shape includes the reference, the shape type, and offset
   measurement values for X, Y, and optionally Z. See Figure 1.

4. Security Considerations

The XML representation described in this document is designed for
inclusion in a PIDF-LO document.  As such, it is subject to the same
security considerations as are described in [RFC4119]. Considerations
relating to the inclusion of this representation in other XML documents
are outside the scope of this document.

5. IANA Considerations

5.1. INT Name Registry

   This document adds new values to the registry managed by IANA called
"INT Names". The new values are listed below:

   Reference
   Point
   Circle
   Arcband
   Polygon
   SHAPE-OFFSET-X
   SHAPE-OFFSET-Y
   SHAPE-OFFSET-Z
   Radius
   InnerRadius
