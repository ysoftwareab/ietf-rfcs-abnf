Abstract

   The Simple Service Location Protocol (SSLP) provides a framework for
   the discovery and selection of the services working on 6LoWPAN.  The
   protocol has a simple structure that is easy to be implemented on
   6LoWPAN devices that are characterized by short range, low bit rate
   and low power.  The protocol also offers a mechanism for
   interoperability with the IP networks under SLP.  It enables
   communication between 6LoWPAN and other IP networks.

Internet-Draft              SSLP for 6LoWPAN                October 2009


1.  Introduction

   6LoWPAN stands for IPv6 layer over low-power wireless personal area
   networks (LoWPAN) which consist of devices that conform to the IEEE
   802.15.4-2003 standard [ieee802.15.4].  IEEE 802.15.4 devices are
   used to provide services like home security, fire alarm, medical
   sensing/monitoring, heating control, and building automation, etc.
   When clients want to use services without configuration, a service
   discovery mechanism is needed.

   In IP networks, the Service Location Protocol(SLP) is used for access
   to information about the existence, location, and configuration of
   networked services [RFC2608].  SLP is well operating in IP networks,
   but there are several issues to be solved [I-D.kushalnagar-lowpan-
   goals-assumptions] to apply it to 6LoWPAN.  The limited packet size
   of 6LoWPANs is one of them; Given that in the worst case the maximum
   size available for transmitting IP packets over IEEE 802.15.4 frame
   is 81 octets, and that the IPv6 header is 40 octets long, (without
   optional headers), this leaves only 41 octets for upper-layer
   protocols, like UDP and TCP.  UDP uses 8 octets in the header,
   thereby leaving 33 octets for data, like SLP, over UDP.  However, the
   SLP message could easily be greater than this remaining octets, and
   it should be transmitted as multiple packets, causing traffic
   overheads to 6LoWPAN.

   [RFC4944] introduces the adaption layer of fragmentation and
   reassembly for IPv6 packets, while providing a header compression
   scheme for reducing the size of the IPv6 header.  Also, it expects
   that 6LoWPAN uses mesh routing for the multi-hop forwarding of IPv6
   packets at sub-IP layer.  This makes it difficult to use SLP
   directly, requiring to define a simple service discovery protcol to
   discover, control, and maintain services provided by devices in
   6LoWPAN.

   This document defines the Simple Service Location Protocol(SSLP)
   which provides a framework for the discovery and selection of network
   services in 6LoWPAN.  SSLP is simple and lightweight to be
   transmitted efficiently in 6LoWPAN.  SSLP uses the Tokenized XML
   strings to minimize the packet excange.  SSLP in 6LoWPAN could also
   interwork with SLPv2[RFC2608] in external IP networks.  That is,
   clients can discover and control services in 6LoWPAN regardless of
   whether they are located inside the 6LoWPAN or not.

2.  Terminology

   Terminologies used in this document are defined in [RFC2608] as
   follows:

      User Agent (UA): A process working on the user's behalf to
      establish contact with some service.  The UA retrieves service
      information from the Service Agents or Directory Agents.

      Service Agent (SA): A process working on the behalf of one or more
      services to advertise the services.

      Directory Agent (DA): A process which collects service
      advertisements.

      Service Type: Each type of service has a unique Service Type
      string.

      Naming Authority: The agency or group which catalogs given Service
      Types and Attributes.  The default Naming Authority is IANA.

      Scope: A set of services, typically making up a logical
      administrative group.

      Translation Agent(TA): is newly defined in this document for
      interworking with SLPv2 in IP networks.  TA is a process working
      on a device which has interfaces to both IP networks and 6LoWPAN.
      It translates SLPv2 messages into SSLP messages, and vice versa.

2.1.  Notation Conventions

      Syntax: Syntax for string based protocols follow the conventions
      defined for ABNF [RFC2234].

      Strings: All strings are encoded using the UTF-8 [RFC3629]
      transformation of the Unicode character set and are NOT null
      terminated when transmitted.  Strings are preceded by a two byte
      length field.

      string-list: A comma delimited list of strings with the following
      syntax: string-list = string / string ',' string-list

   In format diagrams, any field ending with a \ indicates a variable
   length field, given by a prior length field in the protocol.

3.  Protocol Overview

   The Simple Service Location Protocol (SSLP) supports the same
   framework as SLP in which client applications are modeled as 'User
   Agents' (UAs), and services are advertised by 'Service Agents' (SAs).
   The 'Directory Agent' (DA) functions as a cache of the information
   about services registered by SAs and informs UAs of the existence of
   services.  Besides, SSLP introduces 'Translation Agents' which

   perform the translation of messages (which are defined in Section 4)
   for the interoperability with SLPv2.

   The role of UA, SA, and DA in SSLP is not quite different from the
   ones in SLP.  The UA issues a 'Service Request' (SREQ) on behalf of
   the client application, specifying the characteristics of the service
   which the client requires.  The UA will receive a 'Service Reply'
   (SREP) specifying the location of all services in the 6LoWPAN which
   satisfy the request.

   SSLP allows both the two-party and three-party service discovery
   mechanisms.  In the two-party discovery, the UA directly issues SREQ
   to SAs.  This mechanism is useful for a small-sized 6LoWPAN because
   it doesn't require the configuration of DAs.  In this case, the UA
   broadcasts (or multicasts if possible) a SREQ to the entire 6LoWPAN
   to which it belongs using the link layer broadcasting scheme.

   In the three-party discovery, one or more DAs are employed in order
   to reduce the broadcasting overheads of service requests especially
   for a large 6LoWPAN.  SAs send a 'Service Registration' (SREG)
   containing all the services they advertise to DAs and receive
   'Service Acknowledgement' (SACK) in reply.  DA caches mapping of
   Service to XML Token.  SACK includes the corresponding Token that DA
   has assign to the SREG service.  These advertisements must be
   refreshed with the DA or they expire.  UAs unicast SREQ to DAs
   instead of SAs if any DAs are known.  UAs and SAs MAY discover DAs in
   two ways.  One, they broadcast a (SREQ) message for the DA service
   when they start up.  Two, the DA sends unsilicited DA advetisment
   message periodially, which is listened by UAs and SAs.  In both the
   cases the UAs and SAs receive DA Advertisement (DADV) message.  DADV
   message contains the XML token corresponding to SREQ service message.

   Services are grouped together using 'scopes'.  These are strings
   which identify services by location, administrative grouping,
   proximity in a network topology or some other category.

             Figure 1: The operation of Translation Agent(TA)

   The 'Translation Agent' (TA) must work on a machine which reaches
   both a IP network and a 6LoWPAN.  If a TA receives either a SLP
   message from a IP network or a SSLP message from a 6LoWPAN, it maps
   the SSLP messages to SLP messages and vice versa.  TA gets Service
   Request Messages from DA of SSLP and forwards to corresponding SLP
   messages .  This operation is essentially needed for SSLP to be

   interoperable with SLP and vice versa.  With the TA, a UA can
   discover and control services in 6LoWPAN regardless of whether they
   are located inside the 6LoWPAN or not.  Further work on TA TBD.

4.  Required Simple Service Location Protocol(SSLP) Messages

   The minimum required implementation of SSLP consists of a UA, SA or
   both.  The use of DA in itself is optional but in case a DA is
   deployed it MUST support all the SSLP messages.

   SAs and UAs MUST support SREQ, SREP, and DADV.  SAs MUST also support
   SREG, SACK, and SADV.  For UAs and SAs, to support the other messages
   is OPTIONAL.

   All SSLP messages begin with the following header:

                          1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                  Figure 2: SSLP general header format

   Ver field describes the version of SSLP being used.

   Msg-ID is the number representing a message type as shown below:

                  Message Type       Abbreviation    Msg-ID

                  Service Request         SREQ        1

                  Service Deregistration  SDER        9

   Two more message types and there detail needs TBD

   O and F bit are compatible with the flag field in SLPv2 and defined
   in [RFC2608].  OVERFLOW is set when a message's length exceeds what
   can fit into a datagram.  FRESH is set on every new SREG.

   The sequence number is set to a unique value for each unique SREQ
   message.  If the request message is retransmitted, the same sequence
   number is used.  Replies set the sequence number to the same value as

   the sequence number in the SREQ message.  This field is compatible
   with XID field in SLPv2.

          Figure 3: SSLP service request message header format

   Addressing Mode (AM) field has three different values as follows:

      Value   Meaning
      01      16 bit short address is used as Source Address field
      10      64 bit extended address is used as Source Address field
      11      128 bit IPv6 address is used as Source Address field

   If< scope-list >field is omitted, length of< scope-list >field MUST
   be set to zero and all services matching < service-type > are
   discovered independent of < scope-list >.

   The < service-type > field consists of service type strings.  Service
   Types SHOULD be defined by a "Service Template" [RFC2609], which
   provides expected attributes, values and protocol behavior.

   In the presence of one or more DAs, UAs unicast SREQ messages to
   them.  DAs MUST issue SREP messages in response to SREQ messages
   whether they know the service location UAs inquire or not.

   A nonzero value in Error Code field indicates an error.  In case of a
   nonzero value of Error Code, the rest of the message MAY be ignored.
   Moreover, errors are only returned against unicast requests.

   Error Code field has different values as follows:

     Value   Meaning
      1      PARSING_ERROR: The message does not obey the SSLP syntax.
      2      SCOPE_ERROR: The scope field in SSLP message did not
             match to the scope supported by DA or SA.
      3      INTERNAL_ERROR: The DA or SA is not working properly
      4      MSG_NOT_SUPPORTED: The DA or SA gets an optional message
             not being supported
      5      ILLEGAL_REGISTRATION: The SREG has problems
      6      DA_BUSY: UA or SA should retry

   SREP message contains zero or more service location entries.  If no
   matching service locations are present in SAs or DAs, the SREP
   message with zero service location entries is returned in response to
   a unicast SREQ message.  However, a SREP message with zero service
   location entries MUST NOT be sent in response to a broadcast SREQ
   message.

   The service location entry is defined as follows:

                         1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                Figure 5: Service location entry format

   A service location entry may not be cached longer than the Lifetime
   seconds mentioned in the Lifetime field of Service location entry.

   Location Type (LT) field has three different values as follows:

     Value   Meaning
     01      16 bit short address is used as Service Location field
     10      64 bit extended address is used as Service Location field
     11      URL Location field is used as Service Location field

   If LT field has the value of 11, Service Location field is replaced
   by the URL Location field defined as follows.

   A DADV message is sent in two cases.  First, when a DA receives a
   SREQ message with service type of "service: directory-agent".
   Second, to send an unsolicited advertising message by the DA.

   The Error Code is set to zero when the DA broadcsts an unsolicited
   advetisement message.  If the DADV is unicast (in response to SREQ
   message with "service:directory agent") the DA returns the same
   errors a SREP would.

   The< scope-list >includes the scope provided by the DA.  The< scope-
   list >of DA MUST not be NULL.

   DAs MUST send unsolicited periodically.  SAs MUST listen for DADVs.

   UAs MAY do this.  In case UAs do not listen to the DADVs, they must
   discover the DAs by sending SREQ message with service type of
   "service: directory-agent".

   A SADV message is sent when a SA receives a SREQ message with service
   type of "service: service-agent" or when SAs send unsolicited
   advertisment messages in the absence of DAs.  SAs MUST not generate
   Service Agent Advertisement (SADV) messages if they have been
   configured to use specific DA(s).

   The Service Location Entry Count is set to 1 while responding to a
   SERQ with service type of "service: directory-agent".  The Service
   Location Entry is filled as "service:directory-agent://< adr of SA >.
   In case of unsolited DADV, all the services provided by the SA are
   listed in the Service Location Entry preceded by the Service Location
   Entry count.

5.  Optional Simple Service Location Protocol(SSLP) Messages

5.1.  Service Type Request

   The service type request (STREQ) allows a UA to find all the service
   types available on the network.

   In the presence of one or more DAs, UAs unicast STREQ messages to
   them.  DAs MUST issue Service Type Reply (STREP) messages in response
   to STREQ messages.

   In the absence of DAs, STREQ messages are broadcasted over 6LoWPAN
   and SAs respond with STREP messages.

5.2.  Service Type Reply

         Figure 11: SSLP service type reply header format

   The Service Location Entry is included in STREQ to reduce the
   communication overhead when there is no DA.  Without Service Location
   Entry the UA ahs to maks two broadcasts.  First, it shall broadcast
   STREQ to find all the service types in the network.  Second, UA shall
   broadcast SREQ to discover the SAs which can provide a specific
   service type.  However, in the presence of Service Location Entry a
   unicast SREQ can be made after knowing all the service types.

   The service type list < stype-list > is a < string-list > field which
   contains the list of available service types with an SA or a DA.

5.3.  Service Deregistration Message

   The DA deletes a service registration when the Lifetime for the
   service expires.  In case an SA terminates the service provisioning
   before its Lifetime is expired, it SHOULD deregister with the DA.  SA
   MUST derigister the services with the same scope list which was used
   for service registration.

      Figure 12: SSLP service deregisteration message header format

   SDER messages are sent to DAs when SAs do not provide their services
   any more.  These messages help eliminating any stale entries in the
   DAs.

6.  Interoperability

   SSLP interoperates with SLPv2 via Translation Agent (TA).  A TA MUST
   be capable of the translation between SLPv2 and SSLP.  In other
   words, TA translates SLPv2 messages into SSLP messages, and vice
   versa.  SSLP Service Request will be tranformed to SLP Service
   Request message.  TA receives Service Reply from SLP and then
   transforms that message to SSLP Service Reply Message.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the [RFC3111] are applicable to this
   document.  Especially, Translation Agent (TA) MUST be secured for
   processing SSLP/SLP messages translation and specific considerations
   will be carefully studied in the next versions.

8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
