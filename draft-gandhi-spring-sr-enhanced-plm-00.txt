1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
   greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
   (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-
   MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes [RFC8402].  SR takes advantage of
   the Equal-Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  SR
   Policies as defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] are
   used to steer traffic through a specific, user-defined paths using a
   stack of Segments.  Built-in Liveness Monitoring for detecting faults
   as well as Performance Delay and Loss Monitoring are essential
   requirements to provide Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in SR
   networks.

   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) defined in [RFC4656]
   and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) defined in [RFC5357]
   provide capabilities for the measurement of various performance

   metrics in IP networks using probe messages.  The TWAMP Light
   [Appendix I in RFC 5357] provides simplified mechanisms for active
   performance measurement in Customer IP networks by provisioning UDP
   paths that eliminates the control-channel signaling.  The Simple Two-
   way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp]
   alleviates the control-channel signaling by using configuration data
   model to provision a test-channel.  [I-D.gandhi-spring-twamp-srpm]
   defines procedure for using TWAMP Light and STAMP messages with user-
   defined IP/UDP paths in SR networks and is applicable to both SR-MPLS
   and SRv6 data planes.

   For Liveness Monitoring, Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
   (S-BFD) [RFC7880] can be used in Segment Routing networks.  However,
   S-BFD requires protocol support on the reflector node to process the
   S-BFD packets as packets are punted from forwarding path in order to
   send reply thereby limiting the scale for number of sessions and
   fault detection interval.  In addition, S-BFD protocol does not have
   the capability today to enable performance delay and loss monitoring
   in SR networks.  Enabling multiple protocols in SR networks, S-BFD
   for liveness monitoring and TWAMP Light or STAMP for performance
   delay and loss monitoring increases the operational complexity in SR
   networks.

   This document defines procedure for Enhanced Performance and Liveness
   Monitoring (PLM) in Segment Routing networks.  The procedure uses the
   probe messages defined in [RFC5357] (Two-Way Active Measurement
   Protocol (TWAMP) Light) as well as STAMP defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp] in loopback mode.  The procedure specified is
   applicable to both SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes.

   The procedure defined in this document will be updated in a future
   revision to include performance loss monitoring as well.

3.  Liveness Monitoring

   For liveness monitoring for an SR Policy, the loopback mode as
   defined in Section 4.2.3 of [I-D.gandhi-spring-twamp-srpm] is used.
   The TWAMP Light probe messages for delay measurement defined in
   Section 4.2.1 of [RFC5357] or STAMP probe messages as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp] are sent by the sender (head-end) node R1 to
   the reflector endpoint node R5 of the SR Policy using the user-
   configured IP/UDP path as shown in Figure 1.

                          Figure 1: Loopback Mode

   The probe messages are sent using the Segment List (SL) of the SR
   Policy.  When an SR Policy has more than one Segment List, multiple
   probe messages are sent, one using each Segment List.  The Source and
   Destination IP addresses in the probe messages are set to the
   reflector endpoint and the sender head-end node addresses,
   respectively.  The IPv4 Time To Live (TTL), IPv6 Hop Limit (HL),
   Router Alert (RA) Option and UDP checksum fields in the probe
   messages are set using the procedures defined in
   [I-D.gandhi-spring-twamp-srpm].

   The probe packets are not punted on the reflector node but are simply
   forwarded just like data traffic.  The probe messages are received
   back by the sender node via IP/UDP [RFC0768] return path by default.
   The Segment List of the return SR path can be added in the probe
   message header to receive the probe message on a specific reverse
   path using the mechanisms defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-binding-label-sid]
   and [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path].  In either case, the reflector node
   must not drop the loopback probe messages, for example, due to a
   local policy provisioned on the node.

   Liveness failure is notified when consecutive N number of probe
   messages are not received back at the sender, where N is locally
   provisioned value.

3.1.  Loopback Mode for SR-MPLS

   The TWAMP Light or STAMP probe messages are sent using the label
   stack of the SR Policy as shown in Figure 2 using the procedure
   specified in [I-D.gandhi-spring-twamp-srpm].  The label stack can
   contain a reverse SR-MPLS path to receive the reply on a specific
   path.

4.  Enhanced Performance and Liveness Monitoring

   The enhanced performance and liveness monitoring for an SR Policy is
   defined using the loopback mode enabled with network programming.
   The network programming function optimizes the "operations of punt,
   add receive timestamp and inject the probe packet" on the reflector
   node and is implemented in hardware.  In this mode, both transmit
   (t1) and receive (t2) timestamps in data plane are collected by the
   probe messages sent in loopback mode as shown in Figure 4.  The
   payload of the probe message is not modified by any intermediate
   nodes.

                  |       | - - - - - - - - - - |       |

   timestamp.  The endpoint node adds the receive timestamp (at the
   fixed location locally provisioned consistently in the network) in
   the payload of the received TWAMP Light or STAMP probe message
   without punting the probe message in control-plane.  The reflector
   endpoint node only adds the receive timestamp if the source address
   in the probe message matches the local node address to ensure that
   the receive timestamp is returned by the intended endpoint node.  In
   addition, the UDP port in the probe message must be locally
   programmed for adding the timestamp in the probe message.  The end-
   to-end one-way delay is measured using the receive (t2) and transmit
   (t1) timestamps in the probe message.

   Timestamp format recommended is 64-bit PTPv2 [IEEE1588] as specified
   in [RFC8186] implemented in hardware.  Note that the timestamp format
   can be locally provisioned as part of enabling the network
   programming function.  In addition to adding the timestamp in the
   message, the "Error Estimate" field in the payload of the message is
   updated using the procedure defined in [RFC4656].

   The network programming function is enabled to add receive timestamp
   in the payload of the probe message at a specific location which is
   also locally provisioned.  In TWAMP Light message defined in
   Section 4.2.1 of [RFC5357] or STAMP message defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp] for delay measurement, the 64-bit receive
   timestamp is added at byte-offset 16 which is from the start of the
   payload.

   Liveness failure is notified when consecutive N number of probe
   messages are not received back at the sender, where N is locally
   provisioned value.  Similarly, delay metrics are notified when
   consecutive M number of probe messages have measured delay values
   violate user-configured threshold, where M is also locally
   provisioned value.

4.1.  Loopback Mode Enabled with Network Programming for SR-MPLS

   In this document, new Timestamp Label (special purpose label with
   value TBD1) is defined for SR-MPLS to enable network programming
   function for timestamp, pop and forward the received packet.

   In the loopback mode enabled with network programming for SR-MPLS,
   Timestamp Label is added in the MPLS header as shown in Figure 5, to
   collect "Receive Timestamp" field in the payload of the TWAMP Light
   [RFC5357] or STAMP probe message.  When a node receives a message
   with Timestamp Label, other than timestamping the message at a fixed
   location, the node pops the Timestamp Label and forwards the packet
   using the next label or IP header in the packet (just like the
   packets for the normal traffic).

4.1.1.  Node Capability for Timestamp Label

   The ingress node needs to know if the egress node can process the
   Timestamp Label.  The signaling extension for this capability
   exchange is outside the scope of this document.

   Another way is to leverage a centralized controller (e.g., SDN
   controller) to program the ingress and egress nodes.  In this case,
   the controller MUST make sure (e.g., by some capability discovery
   mechanisms outside the scope of this document) that the egress node
   can process the Timestamp Label.

4.2.  Loopback Mode Enabled with Network Programming for SRv6

   In this document, new Endpoint function "Timestamp and Forward (TSF)"
   (value TBD2) is defined for Segment Routing Header (SRH)

   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] for SRv6 to enable network
   programming function for timestamp and forward the received message.

   In the loopback mode enabled with network programming for SRv6,
   END.TSF function is added for the Endpoint SID in SRH
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] as shown in Figure 6, to
   collect "Receive Timestamp" field in the payload of the TWAMP Light
   [RFC5357] or STAMP probe message.  When a node receives a packet with
   END.TSF function for the target SID which is local, other than
   timestamping the packet at a fixed location, the node forwards the
   packet using the next SID or IP header in the packet (just like the
   packets for the normal traffic).

5.  ECMP Handling

   An SR Policy can have ECMPs between the source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  The
   PM probe messages need to be sent to traverse different ECMP paths to
   monitor the liveness for an SR Policy.

   Forwarding plane has various hashing functions available to forward
   packets on specific ECMP paths.  In the IP header of the PM probe
   messages, sweeping of Destination Addresses in 127/8 range for IPv4
   or 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 range for IPv6 can be used to exercise
   different ECMP paths in loopback mode as long as the reverse path is

   also an SR-MPLS or SRv6 path.  The Flow Label field in the outer IPv6
   header can also be used for sweeping ECMP paths.

6.  Security Considerations

   The Performance and Liveness Monitoring is intended for deployment in
   the well-managed private and service provider networks.  As such, it
   assumes that a node involved in a monitoring operation has previously
   verified the integrity of the path and the identity of the far-end
   reflector node.  If desired, attacks can be mitigated by performing
   basic validation and sanity checks, at the sender, of the counter or
   timestamp fields in received measurement response messages.  The
   minimal state associated with these protocols also limits the extent
   of disruption that can be caused by a corrupt or invalid message to a
   single query/response cycle.  Use of HMAC-SHA-256 in the
   authenticated mode protects the data integrity of the probe messages.
   Cryptographic measures may be enhanced by the correct configuration
   of access-control lists and firewalls.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "Special-Purpose Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) Label Values" registry (see <https://www.iana.org/assignments/
   mpls-label-values/mpls-label-values.xml>).  IANA is requested to
   allocate Timestamp Label value from the "Extended Special-Purpose
   MPLS Label Values" registry:

       +-------------+-------------------------+---------------+
       | Value       | Description             | Reference     |
       +-------------+-------------------------+---------------+
       | TBA1        | Timestamp Label         | This document |
       +-------------+-------------------------+---------------+

   IANA is requested to allocate, within the "SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors
   Registry" sub-registry belonging to the top-level "Segment-routing
   with IPv6 data plane (SRv6) Parameters" registry
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming], the following
   allocations:

       +-------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
       | Value       | Endpoint Behavior               | Reference     |
       +-------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
       | TBA2        | END.TSF (Timestamp and Forward) | This document |
       +-------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
