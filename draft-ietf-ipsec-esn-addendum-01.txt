Abstract

   This document describes extensions to the Internet IP Security Domain
   of Interpretation for ISAKMP [DOI] that are needed to support
   negotiation of whether or not a Security Association will use
   Extended (64-bit) Sequence Numbers. (See [AH] and [ESP] for a
   description of Extended Sequence Numbers.)

   Comments should be sent to Stephen Kent (kent@bbn.com).

1. Introduction

   The specifications for the IP Authentication Header [AH] and the IP
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) describe an option for use of
   Extended (64-bit) Sequence Numbers.  This option permits transmission
   of very large volumes of data at high-speeds over an IPsec Security
   Association, without rekeying to avoid sequence number space
   exhaustion. This document describes the additions to the IPsec DOI
   for ISAKMP [DOI] that are needed to support negotiation of the
   Extended Sequence Number option.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [Bra97].


2. IPSEC Security Association Attribute

   The following SA attribute definition is used in Phase II of an IKE
   negotiation.  The attribute type is Basic (B).  Encoding of this
   attribute is defined in the base ISAKMP specification [ISAKMP].
   Attributes described as basic MUST NOT be encoded as variable. See
   [IKE] for further information on attribute encoding in the IPSEC DOI.
   All restrictions listed in [IKE] also apply to the IPSEC DOI and to
   this addendum.

   Attribute Type

       ---------------------------------------------------------
       Extended (64-bit) Sequence Number    TBD             B

   Class Values

       This class specifies that the Security Association will be using
       64-bit Sequence Numbers.  (See [AH] and [ESP] for a description
       of Extended (64-bit) Sequence Numbers.)

3. Attribute Negotiation

   If an implementation receives a defined IPSEC DOI attribute (or
   attribute value) which it does not support, an ATTRIBUTES-NOT-SUPPORT
   SHOULD be sent and the security association setup MUST be aborted.

   If an implementation receives any attribute value but the value for
   64-bit Sequence Numbers, the security association setup MUST be
   aborted.


4. Security Considerations

   This memo pertains to the Internet Key Exchange protocol ([IKE]),
   which combines ISAKMP ([ISAKMP]) and Oakley ([OAKLEY]) to provide for
   the derivation of cryptographic keying material in a secure and
   authenticated manner.  Specific discussion of the various security
   protocols and transforms identified in this document can be found in
   the associated base documents and in the cipher references.

   The addition of the ESN attribute does not change the underlying
   security characteristics of IKE. In using extended sequence numbers
   with ESP, it is important to employ an encryption mode that is secure
   when very large volumes of data are encrypted under a single key.
   Thus, for example, DES in CBC mode would NOT be suitable for use with
   the ESN, because no more than 2^32 blocks should be encrypted under a
   single DES key in that mode. Similarly, the integrity algorithm used
   with ESP or AH should be secure relative to the number of packets
   being protected. To avoid potential security problems imposed by
   algorithm limitations, the SA lifetime may be set to limit the volume
   of data protected with a single key, prior to reaching the 2^64
   packet limit imposed by the ESN.


5. IANA Considerations

   This document contains "magic" numbers to be maintained by the IANA.
   No additional values will be assigned.
