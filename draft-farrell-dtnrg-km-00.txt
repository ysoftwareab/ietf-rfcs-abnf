Abstract

   This short document outlines requirements for DTN key management.  It
   may or may not grow to specify some DTN key management schemes.

Internet-Draft       DTN Key Management Requirements           June 2007


1.  Introduction

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   This document lists a set of putative requirements for key managment
   for DTN protocols, in particular the bundle protocol [2] with the aim
   of assisting in the development of workable key mangement schemes for
   the bundle security protocol [3].

   Readers should also consult the DTN Architecure RFC [4] and the DTN
   Security Overview and Motivations document [5] which contains an
   overview of the current work on DTN security.

   Depending on what happens, this document might grow to include the
   specification of some key management schemes.

2.  Key Management Requirements

   1.  No single KM scheme will work for all DTNs therefore a set of
       schemes, or a framework, is REQUIRED.

   2.  All schemes MUST support some well-defined BSP ciphersuite(s).

   3.  At least one scheme SHOULD be defined for each of:

       1.  Manual keying, i.e. pre-shared secrets or pre-installed
           public keys;

       2.  Key transport & key agreement options.

   4.  Schemes SHOULD be able to use extension blocks to piggy-back KM
       information with application-data handling bundles.

   5.  Schemes MAY involve use of specific bundle payloads.

   6.  Some schemes MUST be defined using standard, well-known
       techniques (e.g.  RSA key transport).

   7.  DTN node connectivity, computation and storage capabilities vary
       enormously, so some scheme for highly challenged nodes SHOULD be
       defined.

3.  Security Considerations

   This memo is entirely about security requirements.  See above.

4.  IANA Considerations

   For now, there are none.  If specific DTN key managmenet schemes are
   defined that meet these requirements, then an IANA registry, or
   entries in an IANA registry, MAY be required.
