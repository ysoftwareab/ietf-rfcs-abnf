1. Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] is a data modeling language used to model
   configuration and state data manipulated by the Network Configuration
   Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241]. A small set of built-in data types are
   defined in [RFC6020], a collection of common data types are further
   defined in [RFC6991].

   This document defines a YANG data model for Network Functions
   Virtualization (NFV).

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. Terminology

   Virtual Machine (VM): A program and configuration of part of a host
   computer server.  Note that the Virtual Machine inherits the
   properties of its host computer server e.g. location, network
   interfaces.

   Virtualised Network Function (VNF): An implementation of an
   executable software program that constitutes the whole or a part of
   an NF and can be deployed on a virtualisation infrastructure.

   VNF Descriptor (VNFD): A configuration template that describes a VNF
   in terms of its deployment and operational behavior, and is used in
   the process of on-boarding and instantiating a VNF. The deployment
   behavior describes the NFV Infrastructure resources that a VNF
   instance requires whereas the operational behavior describes the VNF
   instance topology and VNF instance lifecycle operations.

   VNF Forwarding Graph: A graph specified by a Network Service Provider
   of bi-directional logical links connecting NF nodes where at least
   one node is a VNF through which network traffic is directed.

   VNF Instance: a run-time instantiation of the VNF, resulting from
   completing the instantiation of VNF, using the VNF deployment and
   operational information captured in the VNFD, as well as additional
   run-time instance-specific information and constraints.

   Virtualization Deployment Unit (VDU):  a construct that can be used
   in an information model, supporting the description of the deployment
   and operational behaviour of a subset of a VNF, or the entire VNF if
   it was not componentized in subsets.



4. Data Model of Virtual Network Function Descriptor (VNFD)



   The main objective of VNF modeling will include:

   - Basic VNF attributes: VNF name, function description, sharing or
   non-sharing attribute.

   - Deployment attributes: environment requirements of VNF deployment
   such as the number of VMs, virtual CPU, memory and disk requirements,
   image of each VM, and QoS requirements such as bandwidth and delay of
   VNF.

Internet-Draft           Data Models for NFV              January 2014


   - Interface attributes: external interface, such as interface type,
   configuration parameters of these interfaces.

5. VNF instance Data Model



      The main objective of VNF modeling will include:



      - Operational attributes: which defines the operational and

      management behavior, such as start, stop, pause, migration, etc.





5.1. VNF instance Module Structure



      The data model for VNF instance has the following structure:



   module: ietf-vnf-instance

      +--rw VNF-instance

         +--rw id?          uint32
