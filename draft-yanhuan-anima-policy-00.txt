Abstract

	Recent years have witnessed a rapid development of wireless 
	communication technologies. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are 
	willing to provide customized network services in a very short 
	time to their customers. However, since network demands are highly
	diverse, it is difficult to design the specific network policies 
	that implement the required network services for each scenario. In
	this document, we propose a generic network policy model for 
	future wireless network systems to meet different network demands 
	based on the typical scenarios. Meanwhile, to automatically and 
	intelligently deploy the policies defined by this model, we design 
	a novel architecture that orchestrates the high-level policies 
	into the low-level rules available in the underlying networks.

1. Introduction

    Wireless communication technologies have achieved a great progress 
	in recent years, which are indispensable in many important 
	applications such as Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented Reality 
	(AR). To impel the evolution of wireless network, Internet Service
	Providers (ISPs) have increased their investment to construct or 
	upgrade the network infrastructures, but they can hardly make big 
	profits. This is because they only provide the services of data 
	transmission, which is seen as the plumber. To address it, ISPs 
	have to innovate their service types and open the capability of 
	customizing network services through web portals.

Internet-Draft	    Policy Model and its Application	     August 2017

    However, it is challenging to provide such capabilities. First,
	network demands have become more diverse. Different customers 
	(e.g., enterprises) have different network requirements in their 	
	scenarios. It is expected to provide customized network services 
	for them on demand. However, it is impractical to design the 
	specific network policies for each scenario. Therefore, it is 
	required to design the generic network policy model to meet the 
	demands. Second, implementing network services often requires 
	network operators to manually configure network policies, which 
	leads to low efficiency and is prone to error. Moreover, this 
	process needs to take much time. To quickly and intelligently 
	deploy them, an effective approach is needed to compile the 
	abstract network policies into low-level rules available in the 
	underlying networks. 

    Many previous works [Chaithan_pga_sigcomm] have studied the design
	of network policy model and its deployment in the proposed network
	architecture. However, most of them are applied in the networks 
	deployed in datacenters. In this document, we design a generic 
	network policy model in future wireless network systems based on 
	the typical scenarios. Specifically, we abstract network 
	connections that can be seen as the most basic policies into 
	general types. Based on this abstraction, customers can specify 
	more complicated network policies by adding required network 
	functions. Furthermore, we propose a novel architecture to 
	automatically orchestrate high-level policies into low-level rules
	that can be used for the underlying networks. This helps to 
	improve the efficiency of policy deployment and user experience of
	network services. Therefore, our proposed policy model and its 
	implementation approach can benefit ISPs to design their network 
	systems to provide better network services and gain more revenue. 

2. Design Objective

    Our proposed network policy model aims at providing generic ways 
	to define network polices, which is suitable of customers to 
	conveniently request their on-demand network services. To deploy 
	them in a short time, we propose a modified architecture to 
	perform the automatic compilation. Therefore, it is beneficial of 
	ISPs to design their network systems to improve better network 
	services.
	
3. Requirements and Terminology

3.1. Requirements

    Based on the separation of the control and forwarding plane, the 
	future wireless network system requires to support the NFV 
	capability. Network functions can be implemented by means of the 
	virtualized technologies used in the generic sever. Thus, 
	controller can flexibly deploy required network functions in the
	underlying networks.

3.2. Definition of Terms

    Network service: This consists of one or more network policies,
	which is often provided by the operators.
	
    Network function: It is responsible for processing the specific 
	packets. A network function can be implemented as a virtual 
	element in a generic sever or be embedded in a proprietary device.
	
    Network demand: This consists of required network resources.
	
    Service chain: This defines an ordered set of virtual network 
	functions. For example, firewall can be seen as a virtual network 
	function.
	
4. The Network Policy Model 

    In this section, we introduce our generic network policy model and
	illustrate how it can meet different network demands. 
	
4.1. Model Overview

    For the customers, when they request network services, they do not 
	care about the details in underlying networks. In other words, 
	they focus on network demands associated with their own business. 
	To design the generic model, we have to reasonably abstract 
	network policies used in different scenarios
	
    First, we introduce two basic elements in our model: vertex and 
	edge. We regard a vertex as an endpoint group consisting of 
	multiple endpoint (i.e., a server, a virtual machine or a user 
	equipment). Meanwhile, we can specify the attribute tag of the 
	vertex including the geolocation, tenant and running state. The 
	edge between two vertexes denotes a forwarding path, which is 
	directional. Moreover, the edge can be seen as a classifier that 
	specify packets from/to the required ports or the service chain 
	consisting of multiple network function elements (e.g., middlebox).
	
    Considering that some policies are performed when the special 
	conditions are satisfied, we introduce a novel connection mode, 
	which is called parallel mode. As shown in Figure 1, we define the
	edge drawn in dash line as the triggering condition, and the one 
	drawn in dotted line as the required action. This figure shows 
	that if the transmission delay between two nodes is greater than 
	10 ms, it is required to place an accelerator between them to 
	reduce the delay.

    The network policies are requested on the basis of network 
	connections. Different scenarios have different demands of network 
	connections. For example, two network nodes need to communicate 
	with each other over virtual private network (VPN), which is 
	regarded as the point-to-point communication. To be closer to 
	practical scenarios, we divide the network connections into three 
	types: point to point (seen in Figure 2), point and multiple 
	points (seen in Figure 3), multiple points to multiple points 
	(seen in Figure 4).

    Point-to-point connection is used to establish connection between 
	two nodes, i.e., the connection over VPN. This is the simplest 
	connection type since it only involves the original and 
	destination nodes.
	
    Point and multiple-points connection is an asymmetric connection 
	type. This is because that network traffic has marked orientation. 
	Specifically, one node called the producer produces the large 
	traffic, while other nodes called the consumers consumes the 
	traffic. The reverse is also the same. The typical example is the 
	communication between user devices and the server provided by the 
	content provider.
	
    Multiple-points to multiple-points connection represents the
	interconnection among multiple nodes. The nodes in this type are
	not only service producers but also consumers. The typical example 
	is device to device communication.
	
4.2. Example

    Consider a typical IoT scenario. A company needs to establish 
	network connections to multiple wireless smart devices distributed 
	in three different regions. Meanwhile, it requires to guarantee 
	the communication security and reliability. According to our 
	designed policy model, we can request the network services showed 
	in Figure 5. Specifically, we can regard the devices in each 
	region as a virtual endpoint group. The demands between the 
	company and three endpoint group are the same. To guarantee the 
	security and reliability, the edge between the company and devices 
	need to add the firewall and QoS monitor.

5. The Deployment Architecture

    In this section, we design a policy deployment architecture to 
	automatically compile the requested policies into forwarding rules 
	and network configurations.
	
    Figure 6 shows the policy deployment architecture in wireless
	network system. This architecture is decoupled the controlling 
	plane from the user plane, and consists of five major modules 
	including the application manager (AM), compiler, converter, 
	monitor and controller in controlling plane.

    AM is used to request network services based on our policy model. 
	It can provide services for customers via Application Programming 
	Interfaces (APIs). 
	
    The compiler is to compile high-level network policies. When 
	receiving the requested services, the compiler maps each vertex
	defined in policy model into a virtual network element, and 
	constructs a virtual network topology according to required 
	network connections. If a vertex participates in multiple 
	connection types, we have to add a divider to assure the isolation
	of different services. Meanwhile, the network function elements
	defined in each edge are mapped into virtual network devices. Note
	that in this phase we do not consider available network resources
	in the underlying networks. The purpose of such process is to hide
	from the differences in the underlying network and thus make it 
	more efficiently.

    Monitor is used to process the policies defined in parallel mode. 
	According to the policies, it needs to check whether the required 
	performance is fulfilled. To achieve it, it has to collect the 
	measurements from the underlying networks. When the performance 
	indicator is lower than the required value, it triggers the 
	request notifying the converter enforces pre-defined actions.

    Converter is to convert the results obtained from the compiler 
	into forwarding rules and network configurations. In this phase, 
	we have to consider available network resources in the underlying 
	networks. This information can be obtained from the controller. 
	Meanwhile, it also receives the request that performs the 
	value-added actions from monitor when policies in parallel mode is
	in effect.

    Controller is responsible for configuring network resources to the 
	underlying networks. It not only installs/uninstalls forwarding 
	rules to the switches in the underlying wireless network 
	infrastructure, but also creates, deletes and manages the virtual 
	network function entities in the underlying networks.
	
6. Summary

    This document proposes a generic policy model based on the 
	practical scenarios in future wireless network systems. With this 
	model, customers can conveniently request the network services 
	without caring about the details in the underlying networks. 
	Furthermore, we design an architecture to automatically deploy the 
	defined policies. Our architecture can benefit ISPs to improve 
	user experience on network services as well as increase their 
	revenue.
