              Equal-Cost Multipath Considerations for BGP
               draft-lapukhov-bgp-ecmp-considerations-01

Abstract

   BGP routing protocol defined in ([RFC4271]) employs tie-breaking
   logic to elect single best path among multiple possible.  At the same
   time, it has been common in all practical BGP implementations to
   allow for "equal-cost multipath" (ECMP) path election and programming
   of multiple next-hops in routing tables.  This documents provides
   some common considerations for the ECMP logic, with the intent of
   providing common reference on otherwise unstandardized feature.

1.  Introduction

   Section 9.1.2.2 of [RFC4271] defines step-by step procedure for
   selecting single "best-path" among multiple alternative available for
   the same NLRI (Network Layer Reachability Information) element.  In
   order to improve efficiency in symmetric network topologies is has
   become common practice to allow selecting multiple "equivalent" paths
   for the same prefix.  Most commonly used approach is to stop the tie-
   breaking process after comparing the IGP cost for the NEXT_HOP
   attribute and selecting either all eBGP or all iBGP paths that
   remained equivalent under the tie-breaking rules (see [BGPMP] for a
   vendor document explaining the logic).  Basically, the steps that
   compare the BGP identifier and BGP peer IP addresses (steps (f) and
   (g)) are ignored for the purpose of multipath routing.  BGP
   implementations commonly have a configuration knob that specifies the
   maximum number of equivalent paths that may be programmed to the
   routing table.  There is also common a knob to enable multipath
   separately for iBGP-learned or eBGP-learned paths.

2.  AS-PATH attribute comparison

   A mandatory requirement is for all paths that are candidates for ECMP
   selection to have the same AS_PATH length, computed using the
   standard logic defined in [RFC4271] and [RFC5065], i.e. ignoring the
   AS_SET, AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE, and AS_CONFED_SET segment lengths.  The
   content of the latter attributes is used purely for loop detection.
   Assuming that AS_PATH lengths computed in this fashion are the same,
   many implementations require that content of AS_SEQUENCE segment MUST
   be the same among all equivalent paths.  Two common configuration
   knobs are usually provided: one allowing only the length of AS_PATH
   to be the same, and another requiring that the first AS numbers in

   first AS_SEQUENCE segment found in AS_PATH (often referred to as
   "peer AS" number) be the same as the one found in best path
   (determined by running the full tie-breaking algorithm).  This
   document refer to those two as "multipath as-path relaxed" and
   "multipath same peer-as" knobs.

3.  Multipath among eBGP-learned paths

   Step (d) in Section 9.1.2.2 of [RFC4271] instructs to remove all iBGP
   paths from considerations if an eBGP path is present in the candidate
   set.  This leaves the BGP process with just eBGP paths.  At this
   point, the mandatory BGP NEXT_HOP attribute value most commonly
   belongs to the IP subnet that the BGP speaker shares with advertising
   neighbor.  In this case, it is common for implementation to treat all
   NEXT_HOP values as having the same "internal cost" to reach them per
   the guidance of step (e) of Section 9.1.2.2.  In some cases, either
   static routing or an IGP routing protocol could be running between
   the BGP speakers peering over eBGP session.  An implementation may
   use the metric discovered from the above sources to perform tie-
   breaking even for eBGP paths.

   In case when MED attribute is present in some paths, the set of
   allowed multipath routes will most likely be reduced to the ones
   coming from the same peer AS, per step (c) of Section 9.1.2.2.  This
   is unless the implementation provided a configuration knob to always
   compare MED attributes across all paths, as recommended in [RFC4451].
   In the latter case, the presence of MED attribute does not narrow the
   candidate path set only to the same peer AS.

4.  Multipath among iBGP learned paths

   When all paths for a prefix are learned via iBGP, the tie-breaking
   commonly occurs based on IGP metric of the NEXT_HOP attribute, since
   in most cases iBGP is used along with an underlying IGP.  It is
   possible, in some implementations, to ignore the IGP cost as well, if
   all of the paths are reachable via some kind of tunneling mechanism,
   such as MPLS ([RFC3031]).  This is enabled via a knob referred to as
   "skip igp check" in this document.  Notice that there is no standard
   way for a BGP speaker to detect presence of such tunneling techniques
   other than relying on configuration settings.

   When iBGP is deployed with BGP route-reflectors per [RFC4456] the
   path attribute list may include the CLUSTER_LIST attribute.  Most
   implementations commonly ignore it for the purpose of ECMP route
   selection, assuming that IGP cost along should be sufficient for loop
   prevention.  This assumption may not hold when IGP is not deployed,
   and instead iBGP session are configured to reset the NEXT_HOP
   attribute on every node (this also assumes the use of directly

   connected link IP addresses for session formation).  In this case,
   ignoring CLUSTER_LIST length might lead to routing loops.  It is
   therefore recommended for implementations to have a knob that enables
   accounting for CLUSTER_LIST length when performing multipath route
   selection.  In this case, CLUSTER_LIST attribute length should be
   effectively used to replace the IGP metric.

   Similar to the route-reflector scenario, the use of BGP
   confederations assumes presence of an IGP for proper loop prevention
   in multipath scenarios, and use the IGP metric as the final tie-
   breaker for multipath routing.  In addition to this, and similar to
   eBGP case, implementation often require that equivalent paths belong
   to the same peer member AS as the best-path.  It is useful to have
   two configuration knobs, one enabling "multipath same confederation
   member peer-as" and another enabling less restrictive "confed as-path
   multipath relaxed", which allows selecting multipath routes going via
   any confederation member peer AS.  As mentioned above, the
   AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE value length is usually ignored for the purpose of
   AS_PATH length comparison, relying on IGP cost instead for loop
   prevention.

   In case if IGP is not present with BGP confederation deployment, and
   similar to route-reflection case, it may be needed to consider
   AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE length when selecting the equivalent routes,
   effectively using it as a substitution for IGP metric.  A separate
   configuration knob is needed to allow this behavior.

   Per [RFC5065] the path learned over BGP intra-confederation peering
   sessions are treated as iBGP.  There is no specification or
   operational document that defines how a mixed iBGP route-reflector
   and confederation based model would work together.  Therefore, this
   document does not make recommendations or considers this case.

5.  Multipath among eBGP and iBGP paths

   The best-path selection algorithm explicitly prefers eBGP paths over
   iBGP (or learned from BGP confederation member AS, which is per
   [RFC5065] is treated the same as iBGP from perspective of best-path
   selection).  In some case, allowing multipath routing between eBGP
   and iBGP learned paths might be beneficial.  This is only possible if
   some sort of tunneling technique is used to reach both the eBGP and
   iBGP path.  If this feature is enabled, the equivalent routes are
   selection by stopping the tie-breaking process prior at the MED
   comparison step (c) in Section 9.1.2.2 of [RFC4271].

6.  Multipath with AIGP

   AIGP attribute defined in [RFC7311] must be used for best-path
   selection prior to running any logic of Section 9.1.2.2.  Only the
   paths with minimal value of AIGP metric are eligible for further
   consideration of tie-breaking rules.  The rest of multipath selection
   logic remains the same.

7.  Best path advertisement

   Event though multiple equivalent paths may be selected for
   programming into the routing table, the BGP speaker always announces
   single best-path to its peers, unless BGP "Add-Path" feature has been
   enabled as described in [RFC7911].  The unique best-path is elected
   among the multi-path set using the standard tie-breaking rules.

8.  Multipath and non-deterministic tie-breaking

   Some implementations may implement non-standard tie-breaking using
   the oldest path rule to improve routing stability.  This is generally
   not recommended, and may interact with multi-path route selection on
   downstream BGP speakers.  That is, after a route flap that affects
   the best-path upstream, the original best path would not be
   recovered, and the older path still be advertised, possibly affecting
   the tie-breaking rules on down-stream device, for example if the
   AS_PATH contents are different from previous.

9.  Weighted equal-cost multipath

   The proposal in [I-D.ietf-idr-link-bandwidth] defines conditions
   where iBGP multipath feature might inform the routing table of the
   "weights" associated with the multiple paths.  The document defines
   the applicability only in iBGP case, though there are implementations
   that apply it to eBGP multipath as well.  The proposal does not
   change the equal-cost multipath selection logic, only associates
   additional load-sharing attributes with equivalent paths.
