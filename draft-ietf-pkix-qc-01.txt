Abstract

This Internet-Draft forms a certificate profile for Qualified
Certificates, based on RFC 2459, for use in the Internet. The term
Qualified Certificate is used to describe a certificate with a
certain qualified status within applicable governing law. Further
Qualified Certificates are issued exclusively to physical persons
represented by a registered unmistakable identity.

The goal of this document is to define a general syntax independent
of local legal requirements. The profile is however designed to allow
further profiling in order to meet specific local needs.

It is important to note that the profile does not define any legal
requirements for Qualified Certificates.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

This is the second official PKIX WG draft.

1 Introduction

This specification is one part of a family of standards for the X.509
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for the Internet. The standard is
based on RFC 2459, which defines underlying certificate formats and
semantics needed for full implementation of this standard.

The standard profiles the format for a specific type of certificates
named Qualified Certificates. The term Qualified Certificates and the
assumptions that affects the scope of this document are discussed in
section 2.

Section 3 defines requirements on information content in Qualified
Certificates. This profile addresses two fields in the basic certi-
ficate as well as five certificate extensions. The certificate
fields are the subject and issuer fields. The certificate extensions
are subject alternative name, certificate policies, key usage, a
private extension for storage of biometric data and a private exten-
sion for storage of statements related to Qualified Certificates.

In Section 4, some security considerations are discussed in order to
clarify the security context in which Qualified Certificates are
assumed to be utilized. Section 5 contains the references.

Appendix A contains all relevant ASN.1 structures that are not
already defined in RFC 2459. Appendix B contains an example certifi-
cate. Appendix C contains Authors Addresses and Appendix D contains
the IETF Copyright Statement.

It should be noted that this specification does not define the
specific semantics of Qualified Certificates, and does not define the
policies that should be used with them. That is, this document
defines what information should go into Qualified Certificates, but
not what that information means. A system that uses Qualified Certi-
ficates must define its own semantics for the information in Quali-
fied Certificates. It is expected that laws and corporate policies
will make these definitions.

2 Requirements and Assumptions

The term "Qualified Certificate" has been used by the European Com-
mission to describe a certain type of certificates with specific
relevance for European legislation. This specification is intended
to support this class of certificates, but its scope is not limited
to this application.

Within this standard the term "Qualified Certificate" is used more
generally, describing the format for a certificate whose primary

Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT August 6, 1999

purpose is identifying a person with high level of assurance in pub-
lic non-repudiation services. The actual mechanisms that will decide
whether a certificate should or should not be considered to be a
"Qualified Certificate" in regard to any legislation are outside the
scope of this standard.

Harmonization in the field of Qualified Certificates is essential
within several aspects that falls outside the scope of RFC 2459. The
most important aspects that affects the scope of this specification
are:

- Definition of names and identity information in order to iden-
tify the associated subject in a uniform way.
- Definition of information which identifies the CA and the jur-
isdiction under which the CA operates when issuing a particular
certificate.
- Definition of key usage extension usage for Qualified Certifi-
cates.
- Definition of information structure for storage of biometric
information.
- Definition of a standardized way to store predefined statements
with relevance for Qualified Certificates.
- Requirements for critical extensions.

2.1 Properties

A Qualified Certificate as defined in this standard is assumed to
have the following properties:

- The certificate is issued by a CA that makes a public statement
that the certificate serves the purpose of a Qualified Certifi-
cate, as discussed in section 2.2
- The certificate indicates a certificate policy consistent with
liabilities, practices and procedures undertaken by the CA, as
discussed in 2.3
- The certificate is issued to a natural person (living human
being).
- The certificate contains an unmistakable identity based on a
pseudonym or a real name of the subject.

2.2 Statement of Purpose

For a certificate to serve the purpose of being a Qualified Certifi-
cate, it is assumed that the CA will have to include in the certifi-
cate a public statement that explicitly defines this intent.

The function of this statement is thus to assist any concerned entity
in evaluating the risk associated with creating or accepting

Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT August 6, 1999

signatures that are based on a Qualified Certificate.

2.3 Policy Issues

Certain policy aspects define the context in which this profile is to
be understood and used. It is however outside the scope of this pro-
file to specify any policies or legal aspects that will govern ser-
vices that issues or utilizes certificates according to this profile.

It is however assumed that the issuing CA will undertake to follow a
publicly available certificate policy that is consistent with its
liabilities, practices and procedures.

2.4 Uniqueness of names

In this draft requirements on name uniqueness are specified by the
terms "distinguished name" and "unmistakable identity", having the
following meaning:

Distinguished name is originally defined in X.501 [X.501] as a
representation of a directory name, defined as a construct that iden-
tifies a particular object from among the set of all objects. An
object can be assigned a distinguished name without being represented
by an entry in the Directory, but this name is then the name its
object entry could have had if it were represented in the Directory.
In the context of qualified certificates, a distinguished name
denotes a set of attribute values [X.501] which forms a name that is
unambiguous within a certain domain that forms either a real or a
virtual DIT (Directory Information Tree)[X.501]. In the case of sub-
ject names the domain is assumed to be at least the issuing domain of
the CA.

An unmistakable identity denotes a set of attributes and/or data ele-
ments, which forms an identity that by unmistakable means relates to
a specific entity. The unmistakable connection between the identity
and the entity may be dependent on the context within which the name
is formed. This context should however be evident for any relying
party given the information in the certificate. Some contexts, such
as when identities are based on pseudonyms, may require assistance
from the CA or a registration authority, to obtain a corresponding
officially registered identity under some predefined circumstances,
such as investigation of criminal offence.

3 Certificate and Certificate Extensions Profile

This section defines a profile for Qualified Certificates. The pro-
file is based on the Internet certificate profile RFC 2459 which in
turn is based on the X.509 version 3 format. For full implementation

Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT August 6, 1999

of this section implementers are REQUIRED to consult the underlying
formats and semantics defined in RFC 2459.

ASN.1 definitions relevant for this section that are not supplied by
RFC 2459 are supplied in Appendix A.

3.1 Basic Certificate Fields

This specification provides additional details regarding the contents
of two fields in the basic certificate. These fields are the issuer
and subject fields.

3.1.1 Issuer

The issuer field SHALL contain an unmistakable identity of the organ-
ization responsible for the certificate, and SHALL include a
registered name of the organization.

The unmistakable identity of the issuer SHALL be specified using an
appropriate subset of the following attributes:

domainComponent;
countryName;
stateOrProvinceName;
organizationName;
localityName;
commonName and
dNQualifier.

Additional attributes MAY be present but they SHOULD NOT be necessary
to identify the issuing organization.

The legal jurisdiction for the issuing CA SHOULD be consistent with
the issuer name.

It should be noted, however, that a relying party MAY have to consult
identified certificate policies and/or the issuer's CPS, in order to
determine the semantics of name fields and legal jurisdiction.

3.1.2 Subject

The subject field SHALL contain a distinguished name of the subject
(see 2.4 for definition of distinguished name).

An unmistakable identity (see 2.4) of the subject (based on a
registered name or a pseudonym) SHALL be present in the certificate
in the subject field and/or the PersonalData field in the subjectAlt-
Name extension (see 3.2.1.).

Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT August 6, 1999

If the PersonalData field is empty, the unmistakable identity of the
subject is determined solely by the subject field. If the Personal-
Data field is present, it SHALL contain a complete unmistakable iden-
tity of the subject. In this case the subject field SHALL still con-
tain a complete distinguished name.

The subject field SHALL include at least one of the following manda-
tory attributes:

Choice I: commonName
Choice II: givenName

Many X.500 implementations require the presence of countryName in the
DIT. In cases where the subject name, as specified in the subject
field, specifies a public X.500 directory entry, the countryName
attribute SHOULD always be present.

The distinguished name of the subject MAY also contain the following
additional attributes:

countryName;
surname;
dNQualifier;
organizationName;
organizationalUnitName;
localityName and
postalAddress.

Other attributes may be present but MUST NOT be necessary to distin-
guish the subject name from other subject names within the issuer
domain.

The countryName attribute value specifies a general context in which
other attributes are to be understood. The country attribute does not
necessarily indicate the subject's country of citizenship or country
of residence, nor does it have to indicate the country of issuance.

The commonName attribute value SHALL, when present, contain a name of
the subject. This MAY be in the subject's preferred presentation for-
mat, or a format preferred by the CA, or some other format. Pseu-
donyms, nicknames and names with spelling other than defined by the
registered name MAY be used. To understand the nature of the name
presented in commonName, complying applications MAY have to examine
present values of the givenName and surname attributes and if neces-
sary, the personal data field in the subjectAltName extension.

The givenName and surname attribute types SHALL, if present, contain
the registered name of the subject, depending on the laws under which

Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner [Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT August 6, 1999

the CA prepares the certificate. These attributes SHALL be used in
the subject field if the commonName attribute is not present. In
cases where the subject only has a single name registered, the given-
Name attribute SHALL be used and the surname attribute SHALL be omit-
ted.

The organizationName attribute type, the localityName attribute type
and the organizationalUnitName attribute type SHALL, when present, be
used to store the name and relevant information of an organization
with which the subject is associated. The type of association between
the organization and the subject is beyond the scope of this docu-
ment.

The postalAddress attribute type SHALL, when present, be used to
store an address with which the subject is associated. If an organ-
izationName value also is present then the postalAddress attribute
value SHALL be associated with the specified organization. The asso-
ciation between the postalAddress and either the subject or the
organizationName is beyond the scope of this document.

The dNQualifier attribute type SHALL, when present, be used to dif-
ferentiate between names where the subject field would otherwise be
identical. This qualifier has no defined semantics beyond ensuring
uniqueness of subject names. It MAY contain a number or code
assigned by the CA or an identifier assigned by a government or civil
authority. It is the CA's responsibility to ensure that the dNQual-
ifier is sufficient to resolve any subject name collisions.

Compliant implementations SHALL be able to interpret the attributes
named in this section.

3.2 Certificate Extensions

This specification provides additional details regarding the contents
of five certificate extensions. These extensions are the subject
alternative name, certificate policies, key usage extension, private
extension for biometric information and private extension for Quali-
fied Certificate statements.

3.2.1 Subject Alternative Name

This section defines a new Object Identifier and data structure in
the form of a PersonalData field to be contained in the OtherName
subfield of the subjectAltName extension. This field may be used to
construct a unique name from personal attributes of the subject.
This data may be useful to a relying party in identifying the person
that is the subject of the certificate.

Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner [Page 9]

INTERNET DRAFT August 6, 1999

If the subjectAltName extension contains this PersonalData field, it
SHALL contain an unmistakable identity of the subject (see 2.4). The
subject field is still required to contain a distinguished name
(within issuer domain) as defined in section 3.1.2.

-- OtherName is reproduced here (from RFC 2459) for clarity
-- only. It does not appear in the ASN.1 modules at the end
-- of this specification.

Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner [Page 10]

INTERNET DRAFT August 6, 1999

WITH SYNTAX &Type
SINGLE VALUE &single-valued
ID &id }

The optional nameRegistrationAuthority component SHALL when present,
contain a name of an authority within which associated attribute
values are registered.

The nameRegistrationAuthority component in the PersonalData and the
PersonalDataRecord structure allow specifying multiple name registra-
tion authorities, responsible for different attributes. If the nam-
eRegistrationAuthority field of the PersonalData structure is set, it
serves as the default value for subordinate PersonalDataRecord struc-
tures with an absent nameRegistrationAuthority value.

The optional attributeSemantics component SHALL, when present, con-
tain an OID that defines semantics for associated attributes. The OID
MAY define any set of rules and semantics for any set of attributes.
The attributeSemantics value MAY guide applications how to understand
and display different attribute values. This value MAY also define
the context within which certain attribute values are unique and
thereby provide means to achieve guaranteed uniqueness for the
present set of attribute values

The optional attributeSemantics component in the PersonalData and the
PersonalDataRecord structure allows specifying multiple object iden-
tifiers, describing the semantics for different attribute values. If
the attributeSemantics field of the PersonalData structure is set, it
serves as the default value for subordinate PersonalDataRecord struc-
tures with an absent attributeSemantics value.

Complying applications SHALL expect any subset of the following
defined attribute types within a PersonalDataRecord:

countryName;
givenName;
surname;
pseudonym;
dNQualifier;
dateOfBirth;
placeOfBirth;
gender;
postalAddress;
countryOfCitizenship; and
countryOfResidence.

The PersonalData field may also contain any additional attributes,
subject to local definitions, but they shall not be necessary to

Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner [Page 11]

INTERNET DRAFT August 6, 1999

specify the unmistakable identity of the subject.

Attribute values SHALL be consistent with attribute values stored in
the subject field. (I.e., the subject field and the PersonalData
field may contain different values as long as these values are not in
conflict.)

The countryName attribute value specifies a general context in which
other attributes are to be understood. The country attribute does not
necessarily indicate the subject's country of citizenship or country
of residence, nor does it have to indicate the country of issuance.

The givenName and surname attribute types SHALL, if present, contain
a registered name of the subject, depending on the laws under which
the CA prepares the certificate.

The pseudonym attribute type SHALL, if present, contain a pseudonym
of the subject. The pseudonym SHALL be a registered by a registration
authority, responsible for holding the identity of the real physical
person related to the pseudonym. When this attribute is used the CA
is the default registration authority if no other nameRegistrationAu-
thority value, related to the pseudonym attribute, is present in the
PersonalData field.

The dNQualifier attribute SHALL, when present, contain a local regis-
tration identifier of the subject, such as a drivers license or
government aid registration. Note that the value of this field may
contain digits, alphabetic characters, and punctuation.

The dateOfBirth attribute SHALL, when present, contain the value of
the date of birth of the subject. The manner in which the date of
birth is associated with the subject is outside the scope of this
document.

The placeOfBirth attribute SHALL, when present, contain the value of
the place of birth of the subject. The manner in which the place of
birth is associated with the subject is outside the scope of this
document.

The gender attribute SHALL, when present, contain the value of the
gender of the subject. For females the value "F" and for males the
value "M" have to be used. The manner in which the gender is associ-
ated with the subject is outside the scope of this document.

The postalAddress attribute SHALL, when present, contain the value of
an address with which the subject is associated. This value SHALL be
associated with the subject as a private address even if the pos-
talAddress attribute value in the subject field is associated with an

Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner [Page 12]

INTERNET DRAFT August 6, 1999

organization. The manner in which the postalAddress is associated
with the subject is outside the scope of this document.

The countryOfCitizenship attribute SHALL, when present, contain the
identifier of at least one of the subject's claimed country of
citizenship at the time that the certificate was issued. If the sub-
ject is a citizen of more than one country, more than one country MAY
be present. Determination of citizenship is a matter of law and is
outside the scope of this document.

The countryOfResidence attribute SHALL, when present, contain the
value of at least one country in which the subject is resident. If
the subject is a resident of more than one country, more than one
country MAY be present. Determination of residence is a matter of
law and is outside the scope of this document.

3.2.2 Certificate Policies

The certificate policies extension SHALL contain at least one certi-
ficate policy which reflects the practices and procedures undertaken
by the CA. The certificate policy extension MAY be marked critical.

A statement by the issuer stating the purpose of the certificate as
discussed in 2.2 SHOULD be evident through indicated policies.

In order to enhance path validation based on policy OIDs any state-
ment related to Qualified Certificates, as defined in 3.2.5, SHOULD
also be defined by included certificate policies.

Certificate policies MAY be combined with any qualifier defined in
RFC 2459.

3.2.3 Key Usage

The key usage extension SHALL be present. If the key usage nonRepudi-
ation (1) is asserted then it SHALL NOT be combined with any other
key usage, i.e. if set, the key usage non-repudiation SHALL be set
exclusively.

The key usage extension MAY be marked critical.

3.2.4 Biometric Information

This section defines an extension for storage of biometric informa-
tion. Biometric information is stored in the form of a hash of a
biometric template.

The purpose of this extension is to provide means for authentication

Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner [Page 13]

INTERNET DRAFT August 6, 1999

of biometric information. The biometric information that corresponds
to the stored hash is not stored in this extension, but the extension
MAY include an URI pointing to a location where this information can
be obtained. If included, this URI does not imply that this is the
only way to access this information.

This extension SHALL only be used to store a hash of biometric infor-
mation suitable for human verification, i.e. where decision whether
this information is an accurate representation of the subject, is
performed by a physical person. This implies a usage where the
biometric information is represented by for example a graphical
image, displayed to the relying party, which MAY be used by the rely-
ing party to enhance identification of the subject.

biometricInfo EXTENSION ::= {
SYNTAX BiometricSyntax
IDENTIFIED BY id-pe-biometricInfo }

id-pe-biometricInfo OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-pe 2}

BiometricSyntax ::= SEQUENCE OF BiometricData

BiometricData ::= SEQUENCE {
typeOfBiometricData TypeOfBiometricData,
hashAlgorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
biometricDataHash OCTET STRING,
sourceDataUri IA5String OPTIONAL }

TypeOfBiometricData ::= CHOICE {
predefinedBiometricType PredefinedBiometricType,
biometricDataOid OBJECT IDENTIFIER }

PredefinedBiometricType ::= INTEGER {
picture(0),handwritten-signature(1)}
(picture|handwritten-signature,...)

The predefined biometric type picture, when present, SHALL identify
that the source picture is in the form of a displayable graphical
image of the subject. The hash of the graphical image SHALL only be
calculated over the image data excluding any labels defining the
image type.

The predefined biometric type handwritten-signature, when present,
SHALL identify that the source data is in the form of a displayable
graphical image of the subject's handwritten signature. The hash of
the graphical image SHALL only be calculated over the image data
excluding any labels defining the image type.

Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner [Page 14]

INTERNET DRAFT August 6, 1999

3.2.5 Qualified Certificate Statements

This section defines an extension for inclusion of predefined state-
ments related to Qualified Certificates.

A typical statement suitable for this extension is a statement by the
issuer that the certificate is issued as a Qualified Certificate
according to some predefined requirements (as discussed in 2.2).

Other statements suitable for inclusion in this extension MAY be
statements related to the applicable legal jurisdiction within which
the certificate is issued. As an example this MAY include a maximum
reliance limit for the certificate indicating restrictions on CA's
liability.

Each statement SHALL include an object identifier for the statement
and MAY also include optional qualifying data contained in the sta-
tementInfo parameter.

If the statementInfo parameter is included then the object identifier
of the statement SHALL define the syntax and SHOULD define the seman-
tics of this parameter. If the object identifier does not define the
semantics, a relying party may have to consult a relevant certificate
policy or CPS to determine the exact semantics.

qcStatements EXTENSION ::= {
SYNTAX QcStatementsSyntax
IDENTIFIED BY id-pe-qcStatements }

id-pe-qcStatements OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pe 3}
-- To be assigned

QcStatementsSyntax ::= SEQUENCE OF Statement

Statement ::= SEQUENCE {
statementId OBJECT IDENTIFIER
statementInfo ANY DEFINED BY StatementId OPTIONAL}

4 Security Considerations

The legal value of a digital signature that is validated with a Qual-
ified Certificate will be highly dependent upon the policy governing
the use of the associated private key. Both the private key holder as
well as the relying party should make sure that the private key is
used only with the consent of the legitimate key holder.

Since the public keys are for public use with legal implications for
involved parties, certain conditions should exist before CAs issues

Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner [Page 15]

INTERNET DRAFT August 6, 1999

certificates as Qualified Certificates. The signatures must be unique
to the signer, and must be maintained under the signer's sole con-
trol. That is, a CA should not issue a qualified certificate if the
private key is shared among entities, or the private key is not used
under the subject's control. This implies that the CA must perform
proof-of-possession. In addition, it implies that the CA have some
knowledge about the subject's cryptographic module.

CAs should not issue CA certificates with policy mapping extensions
indicating acceptance of another CA's policy unless these conditions
are met.

Finally, matching rules are not specified for the new attributes
defined in the PersonalData field. It is not expected that two quali-
fied certificates would be compared to determine if they represent
the same physical entity. Such a comparison may provide misleading
results and should not be performed.

This specification is a profile of RFC 2459. The security considera-
tions section of that document applies to this specification as well.

Appendix A. ASN.1 definitions

As in RFC 2459, ASN.1 modules are supplied in two different variants
of the ASN.1 syntax.

Section A.1 is basically in the 1988 syntax, and does not use macros.
The ASN.1 syntax does not permit the inclusion of type statements in
the ASN.1 module, and the 1993 ASN.1 standard does not permit use of
the new UNIVERSAL types in modules using the 1988 syntax. However,
the UniversalString and UTF8String choices in DirectoryString were
defined in the 1993 and 1998 versions respectively. As a result, it
was necessary to import definitions for these UNIVERSAL types from
the PKIX1 modules. This appendix may be converted into 1988 ASN.1 by
replacing the definitions for the UNIVERSAL Types with the 1988
catch-all "ANY".

Section A.2 is in the 1993 syntax; it may be converted into the 1998
syntax by removing the 1998 UNIVERSAL Type UTF8String from the
IMPORTS statement.

Appendix B. Example Certificate

This section contains the ASN.1 structure and a hex dump of a 817
byte version 3 qualified certificate. The certificate contains the
following information

1. The serial number is 1
2. The certificate is signed with RSA and the SHA-1 hash algo-
rithm
3. The issuer's distinguished name is O=GMD - Forschungszentrum
Informationstechnik GmbH, C=DE
4. The subject's distinguished name is CN=Petra M. Gloeckner,
O=GMD - Forschungszentrum Informationstechnik GmbH, C=DE
5. The certificate was issued on July 6, 1999 and will expire on
July 6, 2000
6. The certificate contains a 1024 bit RSA key
7. The certificate includes a critical key usage extension
exclusively indicating non-repudiation
8. The certificate includes a certificate policy identifier

indicating the practices and procedures undertaken by the issuing CA
(OID 1.3.36.8.1.1). The certificate policy OID is defined by
TeleTrust, Germany. It is required to be set in a certificate confor-
mant to the german digital signature law.
9. The certificate includes one subject alternative name - a
PersonalData structure (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.8.1) in the OtherName sub-
field containing the following attributes:
Registered by: municpality@seeheim.de
surname: Gloeckner
given name: Petra
date of birth: October, 14th 1971 (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.9.1)
place of birth: Darmstadt (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.9.2)
country of citizenship:DE (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.9.5)
gender: female (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.9.4)
10. The certificate includes a qualified statement (OID
1.3.6.1.5.5.7.1.3) indicating a maximum reliance limit of DM 5000,-.
