Abstract

   This document describes an extension to IKE Phase 1 exchanges that
   increases its usefulness in certain scenarios.


1.  Introduction

   In the IKE key negotiation protocol [RFC2409], the Responder in a
   Phase 1 exchange picks their Phase 1 identity based on the IP
   address of the remote host, the local IP address used in the
   negotiation, and the identity of the Initiator.

   There are some circumstances where the Initiator wishes to
   establish a security association with a specific identity that the
   Responder has.  For example, when IPsec [RFC2401] is used for
   protecting user-to-user traffic, it is desirable to inform the
   Responder's IKE daemon which Identity (and, by extension,
   authentication material) to use.

   The proposed extension to IKE is to allow the Initiator to send a
   suggested Responder ID in the 5th message of main mode, along with
   the Initiator ID normally sent.  The Responder should treat this as
   a hint; the Responder may return a different Phase 1 ID.  The
   Initiator should verify that the returned Phase 1 ID is the same as
   the suggested and, if not, whether the returned Phase 1 ID is
   acceptable.  The suggested ID is included in all encryption and
   authentication operations; for the HASH computation, HASH_I is
   computed over both the Initiator's identity and the suggested
   Responder identity.  Following the notation in [RFC2409]:

   HASH_I = prf(SKEYID, g^xi | g^xr | CKY-I | CKY-R | SAi_b | IDii_b |
                        IDir_s )

   where IDir_s is the "suggested" Responder ID.


2.  Security Considerations

   This documents discusses an extension to the IKE protocol that
   extends its functionality.  The extension has no security
   implications: the Responder's identity is privacy-protected in the
   same way the Initiator's identity is.


3.  IANA Considerations

   No actions by IANA are required.
