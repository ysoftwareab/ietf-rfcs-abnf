  3. Introduction

     Traditionally, the typical connectivity between a service provider
     and a customer is a WAN link with some type of a point-to-point
     protocol. This arrangement was borne out of the necessity to
     traverse TDM circuits originally designed for voice traffic. The
     introduction of WAN links to network architecture significantly
     increased the complexity of the network topologies and required
     high skilled personnel to manage and maintain the network.

     The L2 protocols running over WAN networked served the sole
     purpose of bringing customer traffic to the network core.  These
     protocols did not find any other use in a typical customer network
     and only burdened the customer with the necessity to acquire
     knowledge skills and maintenance ability.

     With the explosive growth of the Internet, the metro and wide area
     networks change and now offer data oriented connectivity.  The
     lower cost of fiber and the popularity of Optical Ethernet brings
     the opportunity to eliminate unnecessary complexity of WAN
     networks.  More and more, the customers have the opportunity to
     extend their networks via a service provider by running native L2
     protocols, such as Ethernet, without having to go through a
     complex and unnecessary transformation to WAN protocols.



     It is anticipated that Network Based Layer 2 VPN services may be
     more transparent to providers, easier to manage, and less
     expensive to maintain. It is also anticipated that networks based
     Layer 2 VPN may be a key service in future metro and wide area
     service infrastructure.

     In this document we attempt to outline the requirements for
     network based Layer 2 VPN services. The work presented in this
     document intends to serve as a guideline for equipment vendors and
     service providers. This document does not discuss any specific
     protocol, however it does specifies requirements that needed to be
     satisfied by a given protocol.

     Typically Layer 2 NBVPN may be used to connect a local LAN segment
     to multiple remote LAN segments. These LAN segments may contain
     one or more Work stations. A pictorial representation of a typical
     deployment is depicted below.

     Fig: Typical Layer 2 NBVPN deployment

     In general Layer 2 NBVPN contain multiple end points (sites).
     These end points may or may not be within the same service
     provider infrastructure. Within a given service provider
     infrastructure there exists multiple Layer 2 NBVPN planes that
     belongs to different customers. [3] Has logically represented this
     as a tower of disks.

     Within each plane, multiple broadcast domains exist based on the
     VLAN usage by the customers. A given VLAN in a given Layer 2 NBVPN
     plane may span across a set of given end points.

     Fig: Placement of Layer 2 NBVPN requirements.

     The above diagram depicts placement of key requirements of Layer 2
     VPN services. In this document we identify six major areas.
     Underlying Layer 2 NBVPN requirements can be classified into one
     or more of these areas. Classification of underlying requirements
     into these major areas allows readers to co-relate stated

  Senevirathne et.al,    Informational û December 2001                 5

                       draft-tsenevir-l2-req-01.txt            July 2001


     requirements into different components of the product or service
     infrastructure, easily. On the other hand it allows readers to
     properly evaluate requirements, technically.

     General/Architecture Requirement Plane (G)

     The requirements in this plane represent global or general
     requirements that covers all other planes or requirements such as
     concepts that specify the entire Layer 2 NBVPN infrastructure.

     Control Plane (C)

     Requirements in this plane represent signaling and control
     functionality.

     Access Plane (A)

     Requirements in this plane specify the CPE-PE Access.

     Forwarding Plane (F)

     Requirements in this plane specify the Forwarding behavior and
     architecture required to implement Layer 2 NBVPN.

     Back-end tunneling Plane (B)

     Requirements in this plane specify the requirements for back-end
     tunneling protocols to properly implement Layer 2 NBVPN services.

     Management Plane (M)

     Management plane specifies management requirements for Layer 2
     NBVPN services. Management plane covers all other planes in the
     Layer 2 NBVPN infrastructure.

     Security Plane (S)

     Security plane specifies security aspects for Layer 2 VPN
     services. Security plane covers all other planes in the Layer 2
     VPN infrastructure.

     NOTE: Some requirements may qualify for more than one plane such
     requirements are identified by specifying the requirement scope
     within (x). As an example a requirement that qualify for both
     Access and Control plane are denoted with a qualifier of (A,C).

  5. Control Plane Requirements

  5.1  Customer End-point and VLAN discovery (C)

     A given customer may have several VLANs spanning multiple sets of
     sites. The L2 NBVPN infrastructure MUST NOT require all VLANs span
     the same set of sites.

  Senevirathne et.al,    Informational û December 2001                 6

                       draft-tsenevir-l2-req-01.txt            July 2001



     For the purpose of packet forwarding, address learning and tunnel
     construction, the infrastructure MUST employ methods to discover
     the end points that belong to different Layer 2 VLAN domains
     within a single L2 NBVPN plane.


     In simpler small-scale implementations, providers may configure
     the remote end-points and VLAN span manually. Though such methods
     works for smaller deployments, ability to discover and bind remote
     sites is essential in larger deployments. Hence it is required to
     have methods in place to distribute VLAN and domain information.
     Automatic VLAN distribution methods are required to have ability
     to limit the scope of distribution of customers VLAN information.


  5.1.1 End-point-VLAN policies

     End-point-VLAN policies are broadly classified in to two
     categories; Announce Polices and Bind polices

     Bind Policies

     Bind polices specifies binding of incoming advertisements to the
     local representation. The End-point-VLAN policies are required to
     be flexible enough to cover different requirements.

     Announce Policies

     Announce policies apply when advertising L2NBVPN information. The
     announce policies identify which reachability information need to
     be advertised and the scope of the advertisement.


  5.2 End-point VLAN tag translation

     The infrastructure MAY support translation of customersÆ VLAN
     tags. Such service simplifies connectivity of sites that want to
     keep their tag assignments or sites that belong to different
     administrative entities.  In the latter case, the connectivity is
     sometimes referred to as L2 extranet.

  5.3 Group (Multicast) Address Registration Services (C)

     Layer 2 NBVPN providers MAY provide Group Address Registration
     service. The Group Address Registration service facilitates
     customers to define applicable flooding scopes for multicast
     addresses. Some available alternatives for Group Address
     Registration services are, IGMP snooping, Generic Multicast
     Address Registration Protocol (GMRP).




  Senevirathne et.al,    Informational û December 2001                 7

                       draft-tsenevir-l2-req-01.txt            July 2001


     In the absence of Group Address Registration services either
     Provider has to manually configure the scope of the multicast
     addresses or flood the multicast addresses to all endpoints.



  5.4 Support for Layer 2 control protocols such as GVRP and STP (C)

     The Layer 2 NBVPN in theory emulates a LAN. Hence like physical
     LAN Layer 2 NBVPN SHOULD be transparent to Layer 2 Control
     protocols such as STP. However, optionally, Laver 2 NBVPN PE
     device MAY participate in GVRP to create forwarding scope
     dynamically, within a given customer domain. (This may be viewed
     same as IGP in VPRN)

     GVRP is used as a dynamic VLAN registration protocol. Traditional
     Layer 2 devices create dynamic Layer 2 forwarding databases based
     on the GVRP registrations from CPE. Layer 2 VPN PE devices are
     required to maintain separate VFI instance for each customer's
     VLAN. In addition, VFI defines binding between the Local VFI and
     remote end points.

     Hence, PE devices that support dynamic VLAN registration via GVRP
     MUST have capabilities to create Layer 2 VFI instances based on
     incoming GVRP registrations. Also PE devices MUST have
     capabilities to bind GVRP registrations to Layer 2 VFI.

     Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a widely used Layer 2 protocol to
     prevent loops. Some customers may wish to implement the redundancy
     using STP rather than purchasing a redundant Layer 2 VPN service
     from the provider. The multi-point-to-multi-point Layer 2 VPN
     services in theory emulates legacy LAN topology. Unlike GVRP, the
     PE devices are not required to participate in STP processing. It
     is sufficient to transparently pass incoming BPDU to remote sites.

     Consider the following fully meshed Layer 2 VPN deployment and the
     logical representation of the deployment. It is clear that ability
     of all end devices to receive BPDU is sufficient for proper
     operation of STP.

  5.5 Recovery and Restoration (C,B,F)

     Redundancy of Layer 2 topologies are mostly implemented using
     Spanning Tree Protocols. Any major change in Layer 2 topology
     requires STP to re-converge. Re-convergence of STP is in the order
     of 10's of seconds. It is sufficient to have the same degree of
     re-convergence capabilities in Layer 2 NBVPN.

     Alternatively Layer 2 NBVPN MAY provide redundant paths to assure
     high availability.  The reaction to failures should result in an
     attempt to restore the service using alternative paths.  It is
     desirable to make the restoration times as small as possible.

     The restoration time SHOULD be less than the failure detection
     time of L3 service running over the same VLAN.

     When implementing fast-reroute methods in the Back-end, the
     architecture MUST not violate requirements specified in this
     document. As an example a fail-over may not cause any packet mis-
     ordering.

  5.6 Dynamic Service Signaling (C)

     A provider MAY offer an in-band method for selecting services from
     the list specified in the SLA.

  6. Forwarding Plane Requirements

  6.1  Layer 2 Virtual Forwarding Instance (F)

     Traditional Layer 2 devices maintain a separate Layer 2 forwarding
     database per VLAN instance. All forwarding decision for the VLAN
     is made using the Layer 2 forwarding database of that VLAN.Layer 2
     NBVPN providers are required separate forwarding decision between
     customers. Within a given customer domain, forwarding decisions
     are again separated based on VLAN usage. Thus Layer 2 NBVPN
     requires two-level Layer 2 Virtual Forwarding Instance.

     Layer 2 NBVPN, Provider Edge devices MUST have capabilities to
     classify incoming customer traffic into the appropriate customer
     domain and identification of the proper Layer 2 Virtual Forwarding
     instance based on Customer domain and VLAN identifier.

  6.2 MAC address learning (F,C)

     The Layer2 NBVPN is intended to be transparent to L2 customer
     networks.

     Traditional Layer 2 devices learn MAC addresses in the context of
     a VLAN. Such devices learn MAC addresses against a
     physical/logical port.

     In Layer 2 NBVPN MAC address learning takes place in the context
     of Layer 2 Virtual Forwarding Instance. That is in the context of
     Customer domain and a VLAN. The reachability of MAC addresses may
     be either via a directly attached physical port or a virtual port
     where remote MAC address may be reached. The virtual port may
     represent a physical port, a tunnel or some other logical
     representation. Hence, Layer 2 NBVPN PE devices are required to
     support virtual port concepts.

     It is expected that the Layer 2 NBVPN is able to derive all
     topology and forwarding information from packets originating at
     end user sites.  The service MAY implement a MAC addresses
     learning mechanism for this purpose.

     The Layer 2 NBVPN is intended to be transparent to Layer 2 end
     user networks.  It MUST NOT require any special packet processing
     by the end users before sending packets to the providerÆs network.


  6.3  Unknown, Multicast and Broadcast forwarding (F)

     Unknown, Broadcast and Multicast packets are required to be
     forwarded to all endpoints of the given customers given VLAN. The
     scope of Broadcast, Multicast and Unknown is called Broadcast
     domain. For a given customer there are multiple Broadcast domains,
     one for each VLAN.


  Senevirathne et.al,    Informational û December 2001                10

                       draft-tsenevir-l2-req-01.txt            July 2001


     The PE device is required to have capabilities to forward traffic
     to multiple end points within a given Broadcast domain.

     The PE device is required to separate traffic between different
     broadcast domains.

     Each Layer 2 Virtual Forwarding Instance (VFI)  is required to
     have flooding capabilities in the scope of its broadcast domain to
     facilitate proper forwarding of Broadcast, Multicast and Unknown
     traffic.
     The Layer2 NBVPN MUST be aware of the existence and the designated
     roles of special MAC addresses such as Multicast and Broadcast
     addresses. The Layer 2 NBVPN MUST forward these packets according
     to their intended functional meaning and scope.

     If the Layer 2 NBVPN relies on MAC learning for its operations, it
     MUST assure proper forwarding of packets with MAC addresses that
     have not been learned.

  6.4  Multi site spanning broadcast domains (F)

     Broadcast domain is defined as the flooding scope of the Layer 2
     network. Flooding scope of a Layer 2 network is the scope of end
     points that are included in Multicast, Broadcast and Unknown
     traffic forwarding. Each broadcast domain is defined in the
     context of a give customer and the scope of a given VLAN. In other
     words each Layer 2 VFI MUST contain its own Broadcast domain or a
     flooding scope.


  6.5 Scope of Unknown MAC Addresses (F,C)

     In general, unknown MAC addresses are flooded to all end point of
     the Layer 2 NBVPN. In order to conserve bandwidth and allow
     security, some customers MAY require Layer 2 NBVPN PE devices
     provide methods to define scope of unicast MAC addresses.


  6.6 Mac address transparency in the core (F,B)

     Traditionally, Layer 2 forwarding requires learning of MAC
     addresses. A given device can only learn a finite set of MAC
     addresses. If Layer 2 NBVPN is implemented with the requirement to
     learn MAC addresses in the core; then the number of Layer 2 NBVPN
     that could be supported in the core will depend on the total
     number of MAC addresses a device can learn. On the other hand any
     topology change in the core may require to relearn MAC addresses.
     In order to keep data flow uninterrupted, during the interval of
     relearning flooding of data is required. Flooding of customer data
     in the network core may affect the available bandwidth. The Layer
     2 address space of each customer is mutually exclusive from one-
     another. Hence the devices in the core are required to maintain
     multiple Layer 2 VFI.

  Senevirathne et.al,    Informational û December 2001                11

                       draft-tsenevir-l2-req-01.txt            July 2001



     Large scale Layer 2 NBVPN deployments MAY require to implement
     tunneling methods that interconnect remote sites. Tunneling
     protocol defines the forwarding in the core. Topology convergence
     and recovery is part of the tunneling protocol. The customer MAC
     addresses and VLAN are  require to be transparent to the devices
     in the core. Hence the devices in the core are not require to
     implement Layer 2 VFI for all the customers in the network. On the
     other hand the devices in the core may not be Layer 2 devices at
     all in its configuration. Only the PE devices required having
     Layer 2 forwarding capabilities in its configuration.

     The Layer 2 NBVPN is intended to be transparent to all customers
     per-VLAN basis.  The Layer 2 NBVPN MUST NOT rely on global
     uniqueness of MAC addresses.


  6.7 Minimum MTU (F)

     The service MUST support customer frames 1500 bytes long.  The
     service MAY offer support for longer frames.

     The service MUST NOT fragment packets.  Packets exceeding
     committed MTU size MUST be discarded.

  6.8 Packet re-ordering or duplication (F)

     The service MUST preserve the order of packet sent from one end
     point to another end point within given VLAN with given committed
     topology.

     The service MUST NOT duplicate packets.

  6.9 Support for MAC Services (G,F)

     Layer 2 NBVPN are required to provide MAC service as specified in
     IEEE 802.1D specification [4] Section 6. Some of the MAC services
     defined in [4] are directly applicable to Layer 2 NBVPN. Some
     other MAC services require changes in order to be meaningful in
     Layer 2 NBVPN applications. In this section each of the MAC
     service requirements specified in [4] are revisited. All Layer 2
     NBVPN devices are required to support MAC services presented in
     this section. Compliance with this section facilitates proper
     operation of 802.1 LAN and seamless integration of Layer 2 NBVPN
     with bridged Local Area Networks.

     A MAC service in the context of Layer 2 NBVPN is defined as;
     Transfer of user data between source and a destination end
     stations via the service access points using the information
     specified in the Layer 2 NBVPN VFI.

  6.9.1 Preservation of MAC services


  Senevirathne et.al,    Informational û December 2001                12

                       draft-tsenevir-l2-req-01.txt            July 2001


     MAC services offered by LAN's interconnected by Layer 2 NBVPN
     devices must be similar to MAC services provided in a single LAN.
     Hence,

     1. A Layer 2 NBVPN must not be directly accessed by end stations
     except for explicit management purposes.

     2. All MAC addresses must be unique within a given customer domain
     and a VLAN, i.e. within VFI.

     3. The MAC addresses of end stations must not be restricted by the
     topology and configuration of the Layer 2 NBVPN.

  6.9.2 Quality of service maintenance

     The quality of services provided by Layer 2 NBVPN must not be
     significantly inferior to that of LAN or IEEE 802.1 bridges.
     Following areas, at minimum, must be considered when evaluating
     the quality of service maintenance in Layer 2 NBVPN. Section 4.14
     above present quality of service requirements that may be specific
     to Layer 2 NBVPN.

     . Service availability
     . Frame loss
     . Frame misordering
     . Frame duplication
     . The transit delay experienced by frames
     . Frame lifetime
     . The undetected frame error rate
     . MTU size support
     . User priority
     . Throughput
     . Scope of Layer 2 forwarding

     Service availability

     Service availability is defined as a fraction of some total time
     during which the Layer 2 NBVPN services are available.

     Automatic reconfiguration and other methods may increase Service
     availability. During service failures or automatic
     reconfiguration, Layer 2 NBVPN devices may deny access and discard
     frames to preserve forwarding aspects and other requirements of
     Layer 2 NBVPN.

     Frame loss

     Layer 2 NBVPN devices do not guarantee frame delivery. Frames may
     be discarded due to several reasons. PE device must provide
     statistics on frame loss that occur within the PE. Layer NBVPN PE
     devices are often connected via some tunneling method. Unlike
     802.1 bridges the Layer 2 NBVPN PE devices may be separated by
     several hops. Hence Frame loss can occur some where in the

  Senevirathne et.al,    Informational û December 2001                13

                       draft-tsenevir-l2-req-01.txt            July 2001


     transit. Collection of such loss of frames is OPTIONAL and some
     implementation may not provide them.

     Frame misordering

     Layer 2 NBVPN must not permit misordering of frames of a given
     customer domain, for  a given VLAN with a given user priority.

     Frame duplication

     The Layer 2 NBVPN must not permit frame duplication. If there
     exists multiple paths between PE devices forwarding pollicies of
     the local PE must ensure that only a single copy of the frame is
     transmitted to the remote PE device. Definition of frame
     forwarding polices are beyond the scope of this document. Section
     7.7 of [4] provides detail explanation of frame forwarding in IEEE
     bridges. These forwarding policies may be extended to Layer 2
     NBVPN.

     Transit delay

     It is difficult to measure the total transit time taken from end
     station to end station. However, transit time of Layer NBVPN PE
     devices may be measured in terms of total time taken for
     reception, classification and transmission of the frame. Transit
     delay of Layer 2 NBVPN MUST be in compliance with 802.1D
     specification [4]. The transit delay introduced by Layer 2 NBVPN
     must not be arbitrarily large.

     Frame lifetime

     In order to ensure proper operation of upper layer protocols,
     Layer 2 NBVPN devices must specify an upper bound to the transit
     delay specified above.

     Traditional bridges consider transmit time as the time taken to
     transmit the packet in to the wire. However, due to multi-hop
     separation between PE devices, the transmission time of a frame at
     PE device must take in to account the delay introduced by the
     transit network (tunnels).

     As per 801.1D[4] specification lower bound for maximum frame life
     time is 1.0 seconds and upper bound for maximum frame life time is
     4.0 seconds.

     Layer 2 NBVPN MAY specify different set of frame life time
     parameters.

     MTU Size.

     Layer 2 NBVPN PE devices and the network must be capable of
     supporting the largest MTU size that customer is required to
     transmit. In another words, customer is capable of transmitting

  Senevirathne et.al,    Informational û December 2001                14

                       draft-tsenevir-l2-req-01.txt            July 2001


     the smallest of all MTU sizes supported by the Layer 2 NBVPN
     devices and the network.

     Priority

     Layer 2 NBVPN PE devices maps priority of incoming user traffic in
     to different internal traffic classes. In the egress to the back
     end (tunnels) PE device may map these traffic classes in to
     different planes of the NBVPN. Each of these planes MAY be defined
     with different traffic engineering parameters. Mapping of user
     priorities to egress traffic planes is entirely a local policy and
     beyond the scope of this publication.

     Throughput

     Based on the service level agreement and bandwidth provisioning,
     the total throughput provided by Layer 2 NBVPN network may be
     significantly less than that of the local LAN. Hence PE device may
     discard frames that exceed the provisioned bandwidth.

     Scope of Layer 2 forwarding

     In order to optimize forwarding of MAC addresses, Layer 2 NBVPN PE
     devices may provide methods to specify the scope of a MAC address.
     The scope of the MAC address is defined as potential end-point
     where such MAC address can appear or where potential stations that
     wish to receive frames are located.


  7. General/Architecture Requirements


  7.1 Layer 2 Domain representation and VLAN allocation (G)

     Layer 2 Network based VPN infrastructure MUST distinguish
     different customer domains. Each of these customer domains MUST
     appear as a L2 broadcast domain network behaving like a LAN (Local
     Area Network).

     Configurations within the provider MUST not constrain customers
     ability to configure VLANs or any other Layer 2 parameters.

     As explained in above section 3.1, Layer 2 NBVPN appears as a
     logical plane in the service infrastructure. The Layer 2 NBVPN
     plane MAY span across multiple service provider infrastructures.
     Layer 2 NBVPN Domain Identifier (L2NBVPNDoamin) uniquely identify
     a given Layer 2 NBVPN. The L2NBVPNDoamin identification is hence
     required to be unique within all service providers.

     It is suggested that L2NBVPNDoamin {AS:L2NBVPNdomain-ID} MAY be
     derived as a combination of AS (Autonomous System) Number and a
     unique number that represent the customer's domain (L2NBVPNdomain-
     ID) within the AS.

  Senevirathne et.al,    Informational û December 2001                15

                       draft-tsenevir-l2-req-01.txt            July 2001



     Within a given AS L2NBVPNdomain-ID MUST be unique for all the end
     points in a given L2NBVPN plane.

  7.2 Customer end point inter connection (G,B)


     Layer 2 networks require a symmetric connectivity between devices.
     In other words each device MUST have connectivity to all other
     devices.

     Hub and spoke or point-to-multi-point is a popular deployment
     model in legacy Frame Relay networks. When providing routed
     services, inter site traffic is routed via the hub site.

     When providing Layer 2 Connectivity, Hub is required to implement
     complex forwarding policies to achieve symmetric connectivity. On
     the other hand hub and spoke model may be used for deployment that
     does not require symmetric connectivity. Example of such
     deployment is - remote sites that requires connectivity to the
     data center and does not require connectivity between remote
     sites.

     Many-to-many (either logical or physical) is required to be
     deployed for Layer 2 services that require symmetric connectivity.
     Enterprise networks that extend the private LAN using Layer2 NBVPN
     require many-to-many connectivity.

  7.3 Class of Service Model (G)

     The VLAN service SHOULD define a graded selection of classes of
     traffic.  This includes, but is not limited to

     o range of priorities
     o best effort vs. guaranteed effort
     o range of minimum delay characteristics

  7.4 L3, and higher, service access point (G)

     The VLAN SHOULD a allow for a Provider based Service Access Point
     for orderly injection of L3 or higher services to the customerÆs
     VLAN.

     As a value added service, L2 NBVPN may provide access to other
     services such as, IP gateways, Storage networks, Content delivery
     etc..

  8. Management Plane Requirements

     Layer 2 NBVPN infrastructure MUST have capabilities to manage and
     monitor different components.



  Senevirathne et.al,    Informational û December 2001                16

                       draft-tsenevir-l2-req-01.txt            July 2001


     Layer 2 NBVPN infrastructure MAY provide methods between CPE-PE
     devices for self provisioning and management.

  8.1 Graceful reconfiguration (M)

     In cases where the provider knows a priori about impending fault,
     the network SHOULD be reconfigured without a loss, duplication, or
     re-ordering of customer packets.  This situation typically arises
     with planned network upgrades, or scheduled maintenance
     activities.


  9. Security Plane Requirements

     All layer 2 NBVPN devices MUST require to have ability to isolate
     traffic for each Layer 2 VFI. Ingress classification MUST be well
     defined such that there exists one and only one VFI for each VLAN
     of each customer domain. In other words, provider MUST provide
     traffic separation between different customers and between
     different VLANs of the same customer.  The traffic separation MUST
     prevent leaking of the traffic in or out of VLANs in a normally
     functioning Layer 2 NBVPN.

     Optionally; PE devices may offer data encryption and
     authentication services. Protection against denial of service
     attacks. Protection against bandwidth and connection hijacking.
     Ability to provide some of these optional security requirements
     may depend on tunneling protocol used in the core.

     In addition, each key requirement plane may specify itÆs own
     security requirements. Such requirements are discussed under each
     of those sections. As an example, Access plane MAY have very
     specific set of requirements that are not related to security
     requirements of Management plane.

  9.1 Immunity from malformed customer traffic (S)

     The providerÆs infrastructure MUST NOT be compromised by
     malformed, or maliciously altered, customer traffic.  This
     includes, but is not limited to, duplicate or invalid MAC
     addresses, short packets, long packets, etc.


  10. Back-End Tunneling Requirements (B)

     The main difference of Layer 2 NBVPN with traditional bridging is
     use of  back-end tunneling.

     The tunneling protocol used MUST be capable of providing a logical
     connectivity between PE device in the NBVPN domain.

     Tunneling protocol MUST be capable of providing required
     connectivity. If the chosen Layer 2 NBVPN service requires many-

  Senevirathne et.al,    Informational û December 2001                17

                       draft-tsenevir-l2-req-01.txt            July 2001


     to-many connectivity then PE device SHOULD require to support the
     many-to-many connectivity in the back-end. If the tunneling
     protocol is not capable of providing the required connectivity
     then PE device MUST have capability to support appropriate
     forwarding behavior.

     The back-end tunneling protocol SHALL not affect the scalability
     of Layer 2 NBVPN service.

     The back-end tunneling protocol MUST not require customers to use
     special equipment or alteration to the normal network
     topology/protocols or other..

     There are several choices for back-end tunneling protocols. The
     choice of tunneling protocol depends on various factors. Popular
     choices are MPLS, IP-tunneling. There are proposals to use
     variations of 802.1Q to achieve required tunneling behavior,
     discussion of such tunneling protocols are beyond the scope of
     this document.


  11. Access Requirements:

     Access requirements broadly specifies the requirements for CPE to
     PE connection.

     CPE-PE access connection MAY require spanning other providers or
     public networks.

     CPE-PE access MAY require to support different technologies such
     as Ethernet, ATM (DSL), Frame Relay etc.

     PE device that provide Layer 2 NBVPN services MAY require to
     support multiple logical access connections over a single physical
     access connection. The logical connection MAY be either in the
     Form IEEE802.1Q VLAN Tagged format or MPLS Label Switched Path or
     ATM connection or some other technology.  When providing logical
     access, PE devices MUST honor QoS and other properties of the
     logical connection. As an example when logical connections are
     provided using IEEE 802.1Q VLAN Tagging, PE device MUST provide
     capabilities honor QoS parameters of the logical connection.

     PE device MUST have capabilities to translate properties of
     logical connections to corresponding properties of the back-end
     tunneling. Translation of these properties are a local policy and
     beyond the scope of this document.


     PE devices SHOULD not restrict the physical connectivity of the
     access to a single technology such as optical Ethernet (10G). PE
     device SHOULD have capabilities to provide different physical
     access technologies.

                       draft-tsenevir-l2-req-01.txt            July 2001


     Access speeds

     The Layer 2 NBVPN service shall allow for sites specific access
     speeds, i.e. it shall be possible to interconnect sites operating
     on and accessing to the backbone on any of the different standard
     access speeds. Neither the access speed to the backbone or the
     bandwidth on the LANs on the sites needs to be identical.

  11.1 Security Requirements for Access Plane

     The PE device SHOULD support all the security requirements
     mandated by the technology used to specify access connections.

     The PE device MAY provide additional security features based on
     the SLA (Service Level Agreement).

     The PE device MAY require to provide additional security services
     based on the access is a direct connection or over a public
     network.

     The security methods used in the access plane MAY not depend on
     the security mechanisms in the back-end.
