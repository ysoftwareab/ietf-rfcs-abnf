Internet-Draft              NEMO Terminology                October 2004



1.  Introduction


   Network mobility support is concerned with managing the mobility of
   an entire network.  This arises when a router connecting an entire
   network to the Internet dynamically changes its point of attachment
   to the Internet therefrom causing the reachability of the entire
   network to be changed in the topology.  Such network is referred to
   as a mobile network.  Without appropriate mechanisms to support
   network mobility, sessions established between nodes in the mobile
   network and the global Internet cannot be maintained while the mobile
   router changes its point of attachment.  As a result, existing
   sessions would break and connectivity to the global Internet would be
   lost.


   This document defines the specific terminology needed to describe the
   problem space, the design goals [4], and the solutions for network
   mobility support.  This terminology complies with the usual IPv6
   terminology [7] and the generic mobility-related terms already
   defined in [3] and in the Mobile IPv6 [1] specifications.  Some terms
   introduced in the present version of the draft may only be useful for
   the purpose of defining the problem scope and functional requirements
   of network mobility support.


   Note that the abbreviation NEMO stands either for "a NEtwork that is
   MObile" and for "NEtwork MObility".  The former (see Section 2.1 is
   used as a noun, e.g.  "a NEMO" meaning "a mobile network".  The
   latter (see Section 7 refers to the concept of "network mobility" as
   in "NEMO Basic Support" and is also the working group's name.


   Section 2 introduces terms to define the architecture while terms
   needed to emphasize the distinct functionalities of those
   architecture components are described in Section 3.  Section 4,
   Section 5 and Section 6 respectively describe terms pertaining to
   nested mobility, multihoming and those necessary to describe the
   different configurations of mobile networks at home.  The different
   types of mobility are defined in Section 7.  The last section lists
   miscellaneous terms which do not fit in either sections.


2.  Architecture Components


   A mobile network is composed by one or more mobile IP-subnet
   (NEMO-link) and is viewed as a single unit.  The unit is connected to
   the Internet by means of mobile routers (MRs).  Nodes behind the MR
   (MNNs) primarily comprise fixed nodes (nodes unable to change their
   point of attachment while maintaining ongoing sessions), and
   additionally mobile nodes (nodes able to change their point of
   attachment while maintaining ongoing sessions).  In most cases, the
   internal structure of the mobile network will in effect be relatively

   stable (no dynamic change of the topology), but this is not a general
   assumption.


   Figure 1 illustrates the architecture components involved in network
   mobility and defined in the below paragraphs: Mobile Router (MR),
   NEMO-link, Mobile Network Node (MNN), "ingress interface", "egress
   interface", and Correspondent Nodes (CNs).  The other terms "access
   router" (AR), "Fixed Node (FN)", "Mobile Node (MN)", "home agent"
   (HA), "home link" and "foreign link" are not terms specific to
   network mobility and are thus defined in [3].

          Figure 2: Single Mobile Subnetwork on a Foreign Link


   At the network layer, MRs get access to the global Internet from the
   Access Routers (ARs) on the visited link.  The MRs maintain the
   Internet connectivity for the entire mobile network.  A given MR has
   one or more egress interface(s) and one or more ingress interface(s).
   When forwarding a packet to the Internet the packet is transmitted
   upstream through one of the MR's egress interfaces to the AR; when
   forwarding a packet from the AR down to the mobile network, the
   packet is transmitted downstream through one of the MR's ingress
   interfaces.


2.1  Mobile Network (NEMO)


   As defined in [3]:


   An entire network, moving as a unit, which dynamically changes its
   point of attachment to the Internet and thus its reachability in the
   topology.  The mobile network is composed of one or more IP-subnets
   and is connected to the global Internet via one or more Mobile
   Routers (MR).  The internal configuration of the mobile network is
   assumed to be relatively stable with respect to the MR.


2.2  Mobile Router (MR)


   As defined in [3]:


   A router capable of changing its point of attachment to the network,
   moving from one link to another link.  The MR is capable of
   forwarding packets between two or more interfaces, and possibly
   running a dynamic routing protocol modifying the state by which it
   does packet forwarding.


   A MR acting as a gateway between an entire mobile network and the
   rest of the Internet has one or more egress interface(s) and one or

Internet-Draft              NEMO Terminology                October 2004



   more ingress interface(s).  Packets forwarded upstream to the rest of
   the Internet are transmitted through one of the MR's egress
   interface; packets forwarded downstream to the mobile network are
   transmitted through one of the MR's ingress interface.


2.3  Egress Interface (E-face)


   As defined in [3]:


   The interface of a MR attached to the home link if the MR is at home,
   or attached to a foreign link if the MR is in a foreign network.


2.4  Ingress Interface (I-face)


   As defined in [3]:


   The interface of a MR attached to a link inside the mobile network.


2.5  Mobile Network Prefix (MNP)


   As defined in [3]:


   A bit string that consists of some number of initial bits of an IP
   address which identifies the entire mobile network within the
   Internet topology.  All nodes in a mobile network necessarily have an
   address containing this prefix.


   MNP is an acronym for Mobile Network Prefix.


2.6  NEMO-link


   A link (subnet) located within the mobile network.


2.7  Mobile Network Node (MNN)


   As defined in [3]:


   Any node (host or router) located within a mobile network, either
   permanently or temporarily.  A Mobile Network Node may either be a
   fixed node (LFN) or a mobile node (VMN or LMN).


2.8  Correspondent Node (CN)


   Any node that is communicating with one or more MNNs.  A CN could be
   either located within a fixed network or within a mobile network, and
   could be either fixed or mobile.

   Within the term Mobile Network Node (MNN), we can distinguish between
   Local Fixed Node (LFN), Visiting Mobile Node (VMN) and Local Mobile
   Node (LMN).  The distinction is a property of how different types of
   nodes can move in the topology and is necessary to discuss issues
   related to mobility management and access control, but does not imply
   that network mobility or host mobility should be handled differently.
   Nodes are classified according to their function and capabilities
   with the rationale that nodes with different properties (may) have
   different requirements.


3.1  Local Fixed Node (LFN)


   A fixed node (FN), either a host or a router, that belongs to the
   mobile network and which is unable to change its point of attachment

   while maintaining ongoing sessions.  Its address is taken from a MNP.


3.2  Visiting Mobile Node (VMN)


   A mobile node (MN), either a host or a router whose home link doesn't
   belong to the mobile network and which is able to change its point of
   attachment while maintaining ongoing sessions.  A VMN that gets
   temporarily attached to a NEMO-link (used as a foreign link) obtains
   an address on that link (i.e.  the address is taken from a MNP).


3.3  Local Mobile Node (LMN)


   A mobile node (MN), either a host or a router whose home link belongs
   to the mobile network and which is able to change its point of
   attachment while maintaining ongoing sessions.  Its address is taken
   from a MNP.  Figure 4 illustrates a LMN changing its point of
   attachment within the mobile network.


3.4  NEMO-enabled node (NEMO-node)


   A node that has been extended with network mobility support
   capabilities and that may take special actions based on that.


   In NEMO Basic Support, only the MR and the HA are NEMO-enabled.


   In NEMO Extended Support, details of the capabilities are not known
   yet, but NEMO-enabled nodes may be implementing some sort of Route
   Optimization.

3.5  MIPv6-enabled (MIPv6-node)


   A node which has been extended with host mobility support
   capabilities as defined Mobile IPv6 in [1] and that may take special
   actions based on that.


3.6  Correspondent Router (CR)


   A router topologically close to the CN that has been extented with
   some mobility support capabilities and that may take special actions
   based on that.  Details of the capabilities do not matter in the
   present documents.  The CR is said NEMO-enabled if such capabilities
   are defined for network mobility support.


4.  Nested Mobility Terms


   Nested mobility occurs when there are more than one level of

Internet-Draft              NEMO Terminology                October 2004



   mobility, i.e.  when a mobile networks acts as an access network and
   allows visiting nodes to get attached to it.  There are two cases of
   nested mobility:


   o  when the attaching node is a single VMN (see figure 4).  For
      instance, when a passenger carrying a mobile phone gets Internet
      access from the public access network deployed into a bus.


   o  when the attaching node is a MR with nodes behind it, i.e.  a
      mobile network (see figure 5).  For instance, when a passenger
      carrying a PAN gets Internet access from the public access network
      deployed in the bus.


   For the second case, we introduce the following terms:


4.1  Nested Mobile Network (nested-NEMO)


   A mobile network is said to be nested when a mobile network
   (sub-NEMO) is getting attached to a larger mobile network
   (parent-NEMO).  The aggregated hierarchy of mobile networks becomes a
   single nested mobile network.


4.2  root-NEMO


   The mobile network at the top of the hierarchy connecting the
   aggregated nested mobile network to the Internet.


4.3  parent-NEMO


   The upstream mobile network providing Internet access to another
   mobile network down the hierarchy.


4.4  sub-NEMO


   The downstream mobile network attached to another mobile network up
   the hierarchy.  It becomes a subservient of the parent-NEMO.  The
   sub-NEMO is getting Internet access through the parent-NEMO and does
   not provide Internet access to the parent-NEMO.


4.5  root-MR


   The MR(s) of the root-NEMO used to connect the nested mobile network
   to the fixed Internet.  Was referred to as "TMLR" (Top-Level Mobile
   Router) in former versions of this document.


4.6  parent-MR


   The MR(s) of the parent-NEMO.

5.  Multihoming Terms


   Multihoming, as currently defined by the IETF, covers
   site-multihoming [8] and host multihoming.  We enlarge this
   terminology to include "multihomed mobile router" and "multihomed
   mobile network".  The specific configurations and issues pertaining
   to multihomed mobile networks are coverd in [5].


5.1  Multihomed host or MNN


   A host (e.g.  a MNN) is multihomed when it has several IPv6 addresses
   to choose between, i.e.  in the following cases when it is either:


      multi-prefixed: multiple prefixes are advertised on the link(s)
      the host is attached to, or.


      multi-interfaced: the host has multiple interfaces to choose
      between, on the same link or not.



5.2  Multihomed Mobile Router


   From the definition of a multihomed host, it follows that a router is
   multihomed when it has several IPv6 addresses to choose between, i.e.
   in the following cases when the MR is either:


      multi-prefixed: multiple prefixes are advertised on the link(s) a
      MR's egress interface is attached to, or.

      multi-interfaced: the MR has multiple egress interfaces to choose
      between, on the same link or not.

5.3  Multihomed Mobile Network (multihomed-NEMO)


   A mobile network is multihomed when either a MR is multihomed or
   there are multiple MRs to choose between, or multiple prefixes are
   advertised in the mobile network.

5.4  Nested Multihomed Mobile Network


   A nested mobile network is multihomed when either a root-MR is
   multihomed or there are multiple root-MRs to choose between or
   multiple prefixes are advertised in the nested mobile network.

5.5  Illustration


   Figure 7 and Figure 8 show two examples of multihomed mobile
   networks.  Figure 9 shows two independent mobile networks.  NEMO-1 is
   single-homed to the Internet through MR1.  NEMO-2 is multihomed to
   the Internet through MR2a and MR2b.  Both mobile networks offer
   access to visiting nodes and networks through an AR.


   Let's consider the two following nested scenarios in Figure 9:


   Scenario 1: what happens when MR2a's egress interfaced is attached to
   AR1 ?




      *  NEMO-2 becomes a subservient of NEMO-1


      *  NEMO-1 becomes the parent-NEMO for NEMO-2 and the root-NEMO for
         the aggregated nested mobile network


      *  NEMO-2 becomes the sub-NEMO


      *  MR1 is the root-MR for the aggregated nested mobile network


      *  MR2a is a sub-MR in the aggregated nested mobile network


      *  NEMO-2 is still multihomed to the Internet through AR1 and ARz


      *  The aggregated nested mobile network is not multihomed since
         NEMO-2 cannot be used as a transit network for NEMO-1


   Scenario 2: what happens when MR1's egress interface is attached to
   AR2 ?




      *  NEMO-1 becomes a subservient of NEMO-2


      *  NEMO-1 becomes the sub-NEMO


      *  NEMO-2 becomes the parent_NEMO for NEMO-1 and also the
         root-NEMO for the aggregated nested mobile network)


      *  MR2a and MR2b are both root-MRs for the aggregated nested
         mobile network


      *  MR1 is a sub-MR in the aggregated nested mobile network

6.  Home Network Model Terms


   The terms in this section are useful to describe the possible
   configurations of mobile networks are home.  The configurations are
   illustrated in [6]


6.1  Home Link


   The link attached to the interface at the Home Agent on which the
   Home Prefix is configured.  The interface can be a virtual interface,
   in which case the Home Link is a virtual Home Link.

Internet-Draft              NEMO Terminology                October 2004



6.2  Home Network


   The Network formed by the application of the Home Prefix on the Home
   Link.  With Nemo, the concept of Home Network is extended as
   explained below.


6.3  Home Address


   With Mobile IPv6, a Home Address is derived from the Home Network
   prefix.  This is generalized in Nemo, with some limitations: A Home
   Address can be either derived from the Home Network or from one of
   the Mobile Router's Mobile Network prefixes.


6.4  Mobile Home Network


   A Mobile Network that also serves as a Home Network.  The MR that
   owns the MNP acts as a Home Agent for it.


6.5  Distributed Home Network


   A Distributed Home Network is advertised by several sites that are
   geographically distributed and meshed using tunnels in a VPN fashion.


6.6  Mobile Aggregated Prefix


   An aggregation of Mobile Network Prefixes.


6..7  Aggregated Home Network


   The Home Network associated with a Mobile Aggregated Prefix.  This
   Aggregation is advertised as a subnet on the Home Link, and thus used
   as Home Network for Nemo purposes.


6.8  Extended Home Network


   The network associated with the aggregation of one or more Home
   Network(s) and Mobile Network(s).  As opposed to the Mobile IPv6 Home
   Network that is a subnet, the extended Home Network is an aggregation
   and is further subnetted.


6.9  Virtual Home Network


   The Home Network associated with a Virtual Network.  The Extended
   Home Network and the Aggregated Home Network can be configured as
   Virtual Home Network.

7.  Mobility Support Terms


7.1  Host Mobility Support


   Host Mobility Support is a mechanism which maintains session
   continuity between mobile nodes and their correspondents upon the
   mobile host's change of point of attachment.  It can be achieved
   using Mobile IPv6 or other mobility support mechanisms.


7.2  Network Mobility Support (NEMO Support)


   Network Mobility Support is a mechanism which maintains session
   continuity between mobile network nodes and their correspondent upon
   a mobile router's change of point of attachment.  Solutions for this
   problem are classified into NEMO Basic Support, and NEMO Extended
   Support.


7.3  NEMO Basic Support


   NEMO Basic Support is a solution to preserve session continuity by
   means of bidirectional tunneling between MRs and their HAs much like
   what is done with [1] for mobile nodes when Routing Optimization is
   not used.  Only the HA and the MR are NEMO-enabled.  The solution for
   doing this is solely specified in [2].


7.4  NEMO Extended Support


   NEMO Extended support is to provide the necessary optimization,
   including routing optimization between arbitrary MNNs and CNs.


7.5  MRHA Tunnel


   The bi-directional tunnel between a Mobile Router and its Home Agent


8..  Miscellaneous Terms


8.1  Idle MNN


   A MNN that does not engage in any communication.


8.2  Idle Mobile Network


   A mobile network that does not engage in any communication outside
   the network can be considered idle from the global Internet.  This
   doesn't imply that MNNs are themselves idle.  Internal traffic
   between any two MNNs located in the same mobile network is not
   concerned by this statement.

9.  Changes since draft-nemo-terminology-01.txt


   - Shorten abstract.


   - Reshaped some figures.


   - LFN, VMN, LMN: said that the node is able/unable to move while
   maintaining/not maintaining ongoing sessions.  Text already
   appareared in the document, but not in the definition itself.


   - NEMO-enabled: said that MR and HA are the only NEMO-enabled nodes
   in NEMO Basic Support


   - Removed "NEMO-enabled MR" as this definition is self-contained into
   "NEMO-enabled Node"


   - Rephrased the definition of "multihomed host", "multihomed router",
   "multihomed mobile network" and removed the terms multi-addressed and
   multi-sited, multi-rooted-NEMO, etc.  Such terms were not so useful,
   and somewhat too long.


   - Added the case "multiple MNPs are advertised" to the definition of
   mobile network


   - Copy-pasted terms defined from RFC 3753 so that the document is
   self-contained


   - Updated References


   - Added new term "Correspondent Router"


   - Permanently removed NEMO-Prefix.  Only MNP will be used


   - Added terms "Mobile Home Network" and "Distributed Home Network" in
   the Home Network Model section.  These 2 terms were provided by
   Pascal Thubert on July 30th 2004


10.  Changes since draft-nemo-terminology-00.txt


   - NEMO will be used either as the concept for NEtwork MObility and a
   noun meaning "NEtwork that is MObile"


   - Deprecated TMLR and MONET.


   - Added NEMO-prefix, NEMO-link, NEMO-enabled MR.


   - Precision that IP address of LFN, LMN, or VMN is taken from a MNP
