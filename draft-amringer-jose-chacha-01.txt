1.  Introduction

   The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) Crypto Forum Research Group
   (CFRG) defined the ChaCha20 and Poly1305 algorithms to be used in
   IETF protocols both independantly and as an AEAD construction
   ([RFC8439]).  It has also been presented with a definition of an
   eXtended-nonce variant ([I-D.irtf-cfrg-xchacha]) for use in stateless
   contexts.  This document defines how to use those algorithms in JOSE
   in an interoperable manner.

   This document defines the conventions to use in the context of
   [RFC7516], and [RFC7517].

1.1.  Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The JOSE key format ("JSON Web Key (JWK)") is defined by [RFC7517]
   and thumbprints for it ("JSON Web Key (JWK) Thumbprint") in
   [RFC7638].

Internet-Draft                                                 July 2019


2.1.  Algorithms

   This section defines the specifics of encrypting a JWE Content
   Encryption Key (CEK) with AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305 [RFC8439] and
   AEAD_XCHACHA20_POLY1305 [I-D.irtf-cfrg-xchacha].

   Use of an Initialization Vector (IV) is REQUIRED with this algorithm.
   The IV is represented in base64url-encoded form as the "iv"
   (initialization vector) Header Parameter value.

   The Additional Authenticated Data value used is the empty octet
   string.

   The JWE Encrypted Key value is the ciphertext output.

   The Authentication Tag output is represented in base64url-encoded
   form as the "tag" (authentication tag) Header Parameter value.

   The following "alg" (algorithm) Header Parameter values are used to
   indicate that the JWE Encrypted Key is the result of encrypting the
   CEK using the corresponding algorithm and IV size:

           +-------------------------+----------+-------------+
           |        Algorithm        | IV size  | "alg" value |
           +-------------------------+----------+-------------+
           |  AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305 | 96 bits  |    C20PKW   |
           | AEAD_XCHACHA20_POLY1305 | 192 bits |   XC20PKW   |
           +-------------------------+----------+-------------+

2.2.  Header Parameters Used for Key Encryption

   The following Header Parameters are used for both algorithms defined
   for key encryption.

2.2.1.  "iv" (Initialization Vector) Header Parameter

   The "iv" (initialization vector) Header Parameter value is the
   base64url-encoded representation of the 96-bit or 192-bit IV value
   used for the key encryption operation.  This Header Parameter MUST be
   present and MUST be understood and processed by implementations when
   these algorithms are used.

2.2.2.  "tag" (Authentication Tag) Header Parameter

   The "tag" (authentication tag) Header Parameter value is the
   base64url-encoded representation of the 128-bit Authentication Tag
   value resulting from the key encryption operation.  This Header

   Parameter MUST be present and MUST be understood and processed by
   implementations when these algorithms are used.

3.  Key Agreement with Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Static

   This section defines the specifics of key agreement with Elliptic
   Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Static [RFC6090], in combination with
   the Concat KDF, as defined in Section 5.8.2.1 of NIST.800-56A [1] for
   use as a symmetric key to wrap the CEK with the "C20PKW", or
   "XC20PKW" algorithms, in the Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode.

   This mode is used exactly as defined in Section 4.6 of RFC7518 [2],
   except that the combined key wrapping algorithms are the ones
   indicated in this document.  All headers pertaining to both the ECDH-
   ES and key wrapping components ("iv",' "tag", "epk", "apu", "apv")
   have the same meaning and requirement as in their original
   definitions.

   The following "alg" (algorithm) Header Parameter values are used to
   indicate that the JWE Encrypted Key is the result of encrypting the
   CEK using the corresponding algorithm:

   +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------+
   |   "alg" value   |             Key Management Algorithm            |
   +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------+
   |  ECDH-ES+C20PKW |  ECDH-ES using Concat KDF and CEK wrapped with  |
   |                 |                      C20PKW                     |
   | ECDH-ES+XC20PKW |  ECDH-ES using Concat KDF and CEK wrapped with  |
   |                 |                     XC20PKW                     |
   +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------+

4.  Content Encryption

4.1.  Algorithms

   This section defines the specifics of performing authenticated
   encryption with ChaCha20-Poly1305.

   The CEK is used as the encryption key.

   Use of an IV is REQUIRED with this algorithm.

   The following "enc" (encryption algorithm) Header Parameter values
   are used to indicate that the JWE Ciphertext and JWE Authentication
   Tag values have been computed using the corresponding algorithm and
   IV size:
