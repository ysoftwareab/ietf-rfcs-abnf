             YANG Groupings for SSH Clients and SSH Servers
                draft-ietf-netconf-ssh-client-server-05

Abstract

   This document defines three YANG modules: the first defines groupings
   for a generic SSH client, the second defines groupings for a generic
   SSH server, and the third defines common identities and groupings
   used by both the client and the server.  It is intended that these
   groupings will be used by applications using the SSH protocol.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines three YANG [RFC7950] modules: the first defines
   a grouping for a generic SSH client, the second defines a grouping
   for a generic SSH server, and the third defines identities and
   groupings common to both the client and the server (SSH is defined in
   [RFC4252], [RFC4253], and [RFC4254]).  It is intended that these
   groupings will be used by applications using the SSH protocol.  For
   instance, these groupings could be used to help define the data model
   for an OpenSSH [OPENSSH] server or a NETCONF over SSH [RFC6242] based
   server.

   The client and server YANG modules in this document each define one
   grouping, which is focused on just SSH-specific configuration, and
   specifically avoids any transport-level configuration, such as what
   ports to listen-on or connect-to.  This enables applications the
   opportunity to define their own strategy for how the underlying TCP
   connection is established.  For instance, applications supporting
   NETCONF Call Home [RFC8071] could use the grouping for the SSH parts
   it provides, while adding data nodes for the TCP-level call-home
   configuration.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The SSH Client Model

   The SSH client model presented in this section contains one YANG
   grouping, to just configure the SSH client, omitting, for instance,
   any configuration for which IP address or port the client should
   connect to.

   This grouping references data nodes defined by the keystore model
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].  For instance, a reference to the
   keystore model is made to indicate which trusted CA certificate a
   client should use to authenticate X.509v3 certificate based host keys
   [RFC6187].

3.1.  Tree Diagram

   The following tree diagram [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams]
   provides an overview of the data model for the "ietf-ssh-client"
   module.

3.2.  Example Usage

   This section shows how it would appear if the ssh-client-grouping
   were populated with some data.  This example is consistent with the
   examples presented in Section 2.2 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].

   [ note: '\' line wrapping for formatting only]

   <!-- hypothetical example, as groupings don't have instance data -->\

   <ssh-client xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ssh-client"
               xmlns:algs="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ssh-common"\
   >

     <!-- how this client will authenticate itself to the server -->
     <client-identity>
       <username>foobar</username>
       <public-key>
         <algorithm xmlns:ks="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-keystore\
   ">ks:secp521r1</algorithm>
         <private-key>base64encodedvalue==</private-key>
         <public-key>base64encodedvalue==</public-key>
       </public-key>
     </client-identity>

     <!-- which host-keys will this client trust -->

4.  The SSH Server Model

   The SSH server model presented in this section contains one YANG
   grouping, for just the SSH-level configuration, omitting, for
   instance, configuration for which ports to open to listen for
   connections on.

   This grouping references data nodes defined by the keystore model
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].  For instance, a reference to the
   keystore model is made to indicate which host key a server should
   present.

4.1.  Tree Diagram

   The following tree diagram [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams]
   provides an overview of the data model for the "ietf-ssh-server"
   module.

5.  The SSH Common Model

   The SSH common model presented in this section contains identities
   and groupings common to both SSH clients and SSH servers.  The
   transport-params-grouping can be used to configure the list of SSH
   transport algorithms permitted by the SSH client or SSH server.  The
   lists of algorithms are ordered such that, if multiple algorithms are
   permitted by the client, the algorithm that appears first in its list
   that is also permitted by the server is used for the SSH transport
   layer connection.  The ability to restrict the the algorithms allowed
   is provided in this grouping for SSH clients and SSH servers that are
   capable of doing so and may serve to make SSH clients and SSH servers
   compliant with security policies.

   Features are defined for algorithms that are OPTIONAL or are not
   widely supported by popular implementations.  Note that the list of
   algorithms is not exhaustive.  As well, some algorithms that are
   REQUIRED by [RFC4253] are missing, notably "ssh-dss" and "diffie-
   hellman-group1-sha1" due to their weak security and there being
   alternatives that are widely supported.

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this document are designed to be accessed
   via YANG based management protocols, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols have mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS) with mutual
   authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC6536] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   Since the modules defined in this document define only groupings,
   these considerations are primarily for the designers of other modules
   that use these groupings.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG modules that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      /: The entire data tree defined by all the modules defined in this
         draft are sensitive to write operations.  For instance, the
         addition or removal of references to keys, certificates,
         trusted anchors, etc., can dramatically alter the implemented
         security policy.  However, no NACM annotations are applied as
         the data SHOULD be editable by users other than a designated
         'recovery session'.

   Some of the readable data nodes in the YANG modules may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      /client-auth/password:  This node in the 'ietf-ssh-client' module
         is additionally sensitive to read operations such that, in
         normal use cases, it should never be returned to a client.  The

         only time this node should be returned is to support backup/
         restore type workflows.  This being the case, this node is
         marked with the NACM value 'default-deny-all'.

   Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      NONE

Appendix A.  Change Log

A.1.  00 to 01

   o  Noted that '0.0.0.0' and '::' might have special meanings.

   o  Renamed "keychain" to "keystore".

A.2.  01 to 02

   o  Removed the groupings 'listening-ssh-client-grouping' and
      'listening-ssh-server-grouping'.  Now modules only contain the
      transport-independent groupings.

   o  Simplified the "client-auth" part in the ietf-ssh-client module.
      It now inlines what it used to point to keystore for.

   o  Added cipher suites for various algorithms into new 'ietf-ssh-
      common' module.

A.3.  02 to 03

   o  Removed 'RESTRICTED' enum from 'password' leaf type.

   o  Added a 'must' statement to container 'server-auth' asserting that
      at least one of the various auth mechanisms must be specified.

   o  Fixed description statement for leaf 'trusted-ca-certs'.

A.4.  03 to 04

   o  Change title to "YANG Groupings for SSH Clients and SSH Servers"

   o  Added reference to RFC 6668

   o  Added RFC 8174 to Requirements Language Section.

   o  Enhanced description statement for ietf-ssh-server's "trusted-ca-
      certs" leaf.

   o  Added mandatory true to ietf-ssh-client's "client-auth" 'choice'
      statement.

   o  Changed the YANG prefix for module ietf-ssh-common from 'sshcom'
      to 'sshcmn'.

   o  Removed the compression algorithms as they are not commonly
      configurable in vendors' implementations.

Internet-DrafYANG Groupings for SSH Clients and SSH Servers October 2017


   o  Updating descriptions in transport-params-grouping and the
      servers's usage of it.

   o  Now tree diagrams reference ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams

   o  Updated YANG to use typedefs around leafrefs to common keystore
      paths

   o  Now inlines key and certificates (no longer a leafref to keystore)

A.5.  04 to 05

   o  Merged changes from co-author.
