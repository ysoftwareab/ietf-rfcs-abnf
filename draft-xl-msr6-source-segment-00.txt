1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing ([RFC8402]) leverages the mechanism of source
   routing.  An ingress node steers a packet through an ordered list of
   instructions, called "segments".  Each one of these instructions
   represents a function to be implemented at a specific location in the
   network.  A function is locally defined on the node where it is
   executed.  Network Programming combines Segment Routing functions to
   achieve a networking objective that goes beyond mere packet routing.
   [RFC8986] defines the SRv6 Network Programming concept and specifies
   the main Segment Routing behaviors and network programming functions.

   Previous segments defined in SRv6 can be used as the destination
   address of an IPv6 packet.  This document introduces the new
   segments, source segments, which can be used as the IPv6 source
   address of an IPv6 packet.  This document defines the general concept
   of source segment and the source segment used for multicast service.
   Protocol extensions on the control plane are not in the scope of this
   document.

Internet-Draft           Source Segment for MSR6            October 2021


   This document defines the general concept of source segment and the
   source segment used for multicast service.  Protocol extensions on
   the control plane are not in the scope of this document.

2.  Terminologies

   The following new terms are used throughout this document:

   MSR6: Multicast Source Routing over IPv6;

   MSR6 Domain: a set of nodes participating in the multicast source
   routing;

3.  Source Segment Definition

   Source segment is different from the existing SID defined in RFC8402
   from the following aspects:

   *  Source segment is unchanged along the SRv6 path

   *  Source segment is distributed by the ingress node but indicates
      functions in other nodes along the path, e.g., egress node.
      Forwarding table should be maintained in the nodes where the
      instruction takes place.

   *  When the source segment is encapsulated in an SRv6 packet, it is
      activated by other instructions in the data plane because source
      address is not parsed in existing forwarding process of a unicast
      packet

   Using source segment for SRv6 Network Programming have several
   benefits including:

   *  Enhance network programming capability for more SRv6 functions and
      extend the programming space in IPv6 header;

   *  Provide sematic for source address with similar IPv6 address
      allocation and management method as SRv6;

   *  Facilitates security management inside the limited domain;

   Source segment should be avoided to process hop by hop.  Per-hop
   process of source segment which will degrade forwarding performance
   and bring compatibility issues.

4.  SID Format

   Source segment leverages the format of SID defined in SRv6 network
   programming.

   Source segment consists of LOC:FUNCT:ARG, where a locator (LOC) is
   encoded in the L most significant bits of the SID, followed by F bits
   of function (FUNCT) and A bits of arguments (ARG).

   A locator may be represented as B:N where B is the SRv6 SID block
   (IPv6 prefix allocated for SRv6 SIDs by the operator) and N is the
   identifier of the ingress node .

   The FUNCT is an opaque identification of the behavior bound to the
   SID.  The behavior could be executed in other nodes except ingress
   node.

   The behavior indicated by FUNCT may require additional information
   for its processing.  This information may be encoded in the ARG bits
   of the SID.

5.  Source Segment for MVPN

   In the multicast service, packet is replicated along the tree towards
   a set of leaf nodes.  MVPN routing and the corresponding information
   could be encapsulated in the source segment carried in the IPv6
   source address.  Source Segment for MVPN is distributed by the
   multicast source node and the function is executed by the multicast
   leaf nodes.As described in section 3, Source Segment for MVPN is not
   changed when the packet is replicated and forwarded along the P2MP
   path.

   This section defines the source segment for MVPN.

5.1.  Behaviors

   The following is a set of behaviors that can be associated with a
   source segment for MVPN.

5.2.  SRC.DT4

   The "Source address for decapsulation and IPv4 table lookup" behavior
   ("Src.DT4" for short) is used in MVPNv4 use case where an MFIB lookup
   in a specific VRF table T at the egress node is required.  The
   Src.DT4 SID is an SID associated with an IPv4 MFIB table T on the
   egress PE, either through a control-plane message advertised by the
   ingress PE, or through a local configuration on the egress PE.  When
   an IPv6 encapsulated packet with IPv6 source address being S is
   received on an egress PE, and S is associated with an Src.DT4 SID on
   the egress PE, the egress PE does the following behavior:

     S01. If (Upper-Layer header type == 4(IPv4) ) {
     S02.    Remove the outer IPv6 header with all its extension headers
     S03.    Set the packet's associated MFIB table to T
     S04.    Submit the packet to the egress IPv4 MFIB lookup for
                transmission to the new multicast downstreams
     S05. } Else {
     S06.    Drop the packet;
     S07. }

5.3.  SRC.DT6

   SRC.DT6 behavior could be used in MVPNv6 use case where a MFIB lookup
   in a specific VRF table at the egress node is required.

     S01. If (Upper-Layer header type == 41(IPv6) ) {
     S02.    Remove the outer IPv6 header with all its extension headers
     S03.    Set the packet's associated IPv6 MFIB table to T
     S04.    Submit the packet to the egress IPv6 MFIB lookup for
                transmission to the new multicast downstreams
     S05. } Else {
     S06.    Drop the packet;
     S07. }

5.4.  SRC.DT46

   SRC.DT46 behavior could be used in MVPN use case where a MFIB lookup
   in a specific VRF table at the egress node is required.

Internet-Draft           Source Segment for MSR6            October 2021


     S01. If (Upper-Layer header type == 4(IPv4) ) {
     S02.    Remove the outer IPv6 header with all its extension headers
     S03.    Set the packet's associated MFIB table to T
     S04.    Submit the packet to the egress IPv4 MFIB lookup for
                transmission to the new destination
     S05. } Else if (Upper-Layer header type == 41(IPv6) ) {
     S06.    Remove the outer IPv6 header with all its extension headers
     S07.    Set the packet's associated MFIB table to T
     S08.    Submit the packet to the egress IPv6 MFIB lookup for
                transmission to the new destination
     S09. } Else {
     S10.    Drop the packet;
     S11. }


5.5.  Src.DT2

   SRC.DT2 behavior could be used in MVPN use case where a L2 table
   lookup in a specific Layer-2 Multicast forwarding table at the egress
   node is required.

   S01. If (Upper-Layer header type == 143(Ethernet) ) {
   S02.    Remove the outer IPv6 header with all its extension headers
   S03.    Set the packet's associated Layer-2 Multicast forwarding table to T
   S04.    Submit the packet to the egress Layer-2 Multicast forwarding table
              lookup for transmission to the new multicast downstreams
   S05. } Else {
   S06.    Send an ICMP Parameter Problem to the Source Address
             with Code 4 (SR Upper-layer Header Error)
             and Pointer set to the offset of the Upper-Layer header,
             interrupt packet processing, and discard the packet
   S07. }

6.  Use Case

   The source segment could be applied in the following case:

   1.  MSR6: The MSR6 MVPN uses the source segment in the IPv6 source
       address for identifying a VRF in IPv6 multicast source routing.

   2.  Tree SID over SRv6: MVPN service can use Tree SID over SRv6
       [I-D.ietf-bess-mvpn-evpn-sr-p2mp] for point-to-multipoint
       transport of a packet.  When a Tree SID over SRv6 P-tunnel is
       shared across different MVPNs, an IPv6 address in IPv6 source
       address for identifying a VRF is possible.

Internet-Draft           Source Segment for MSR6            October 2021


   3.  MVPN service can use Ingress Replication(IR) [RFC6513] to
       simulate a point-to-multipoint P-tunnel.  In an IPv6 environment,
       Ingress Replication can use IPv6 encapsulation for each branch.
       When the egress PE of an Ingress Replication P-tunnel branch
       receives a packet, it gets to know the VRF of the packet through
       the Destination address in the IPv6 header.  This means that,
       every egress PE of the IR P-tunnel branch need to allocate an
       IPv6 address to identify a VRF.  If the source segment is used
       for the IPv6 source address, only one IPv6 address of the Ingress
       PE is needed for identifying a VRF, and thus save the IPv6
       addresses and their operation costs.
