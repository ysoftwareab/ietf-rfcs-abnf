 Interface Stack Table Definition and Example for Point-to-Point (P2P)
                           Interface over LAN
                      draft-liu-lsr-p2poverlan-06

Abstract

   [RFC5309] defines the Point-to-Point (P2P) circuit type, one of the
   two circuit types used in the link state routing protocols, and
   highlights that it is important to identify the correct circuit type
   when forming adjacencies, flooding link state database packets, and
   monitoring the link state.

   The P2P interface over LAN ifType value 303, has been assigned by
   IANA Expert Review, and this document requests IANA to add this
   document as a reference to ifType 303.  This document provides advice
   about the ifStack for the P2P interface over LAN ifType to facilitate
   operational control, maintenance and statistics.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5309] defines the P2P circuit type and highlights that it is
   important to identify the correct circuit type when forming
   adjacencies, flooding link state database packets, and monitoring the
   link state.

   The assignment of 303, as the value for p2pOverLan ifType was made by
   Expert Review [Assignment].  This document requests IANA to add this
   document as a reference to ifType 303.

   To simplify configuration and operational control, it is helpful to
   represent the fact that an interface is to be considered a P2P
   interface over LAN type explicitly in the interface stack.  This
   enables, for example, routing protocols to automatically inherit the
   correct operating mode from the interface stack without further
   configuration (No need to explicitly configure the P2P interface in
   routing protocols).

   It is helpful to map the P2P interface over LAN type in the interface
   management stack table.  And if no entry specifies the P2P interface
   lower layer, the management suffers loses the ability to get to the
   lower layer specific management properties via many tools.

   The purpose of this document is to suggest how to use
   ifStackTable for the P2P interface over LAN type, and provide
   examples.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] [RFC8174].

3.  Interface Stack Table for P2P Interface Type

   If a device implements the IF-MIB [RFC2863], each entry in the
   "/interfaces/interface" list (in "Interface Management YANG") in the
   operational state is typically mapped to one ifEntry as required in
   [RFC8343], therefore the P2P interface over LAN type should also be
   fully mapped to one ifEntry by defining the "ifStackTable" ("higher-
   layer-if" and "lower-layer-if").

   The P2P interface higher layer should be network layer "ipForward"
   (defined in IANA) to run routing protocol, the P2P interface lower
   layer is link data layer "ethernetCsmacd" (defined in IANA).

   The P2P interface type ifStackTable can be defined along the lines of
   following example which complies with [RFC8343] [RFC6991] [RFC8340]:

                    <interface>
                      <name>isis_int</name>
                      <type>ianaift:ipForward</type>
                    </interface>

                    <interface>
                      <name>eth1</name>
                      <type>ianaift:ethernetCsmacd</type>
                    </interface>

                    <interface>
                      <name>p2p</name>
                      <type>ianaift:p2pOverLan</type>
                      <higher-layer-if>isis_int</higher-layer-if>
                      <lower-layer-if>eth1</lower-layer-if>
                      <enabled>false</enabled>
                      <admin-status>down</admin-status>
                      <oper-status>down</oper-status>
                      <statistics>
                        <discontinuity-time>
                          2021-04-01T03:00:00+00:00
                        </discontinuity-time>
                        <!-- counters now shown here -->
                      </statistics>
                    </interface>

4.  Security Considerations

   The interface stack table specified in this document is read-only.
   Read operation to this table should not have a negative effect on
   network operations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   In the Interface Types registry, IANA has been assigned a value of
   303 for p2pOverLan [Assignment] with a reference of [RFC5309].  IANA
   is requested to amend the reference for that code point to be to this
   document and to make a similar amendment in the YANG iana-if-type
   module [RFC7224] which currently points to [RFC8561], as this
   document explains how the ifType is to be used.
