Abstract

   This document defines the DNS resolver (DNSR) option used to advertise 
   IPv6 addresses of DNS resolvers on a link.  The DNSR option, which lists 
   the IPv6 addresses of DNS resolvers that all nodes of the link may use 
   to resolve name or address, is attached to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery 
   Router Advertisement messages that are sent across a link. This 
   document specifies the process used by a host to decide how to 
   configure the IPv6 addresses of DNS resolvers that the host could 
   uses in IPv6 networks. This document defines the mechanism by which a 
   node processes the DNSR option and updates valid IPv6 addresses 
   of DNS resolvers.

1. Introduction

   This specification defines the DNS resolvers (DNSR) option for the
   Neighbor Discovery protocol of IPv6.  The DNSR option extends the
   functionality of Router Advertisement messages [DISCOVERY] to enable
   configuration of a node.  Router Advertisement messages sent
   by a router over a link can be used to assign one or more addresses of 
   DNS resolvers to the nodes connected to the link.

   Because of the deployment of IPv6 network, DNS resolution might
   become a key issue. [DISCOVERY] allows any node to
   autoconfigure a global unicast addresses and default routes. DNS
   Discovery Design Team proposed several solutions. An option to Neighbor 
   Discovery protocol of IPv6 was proposed but has not been studied yet.

   DNSR option will allow any node to discover large scope addresses
   (such as global-unicast addresses) of DNS resolvers. The purpose is
   also to enhance the efficiency of [DISCOVERY] when DHCPv6 servers can
   not be used.

1.1 Motivation

   Many sites, particularly home networks and small companies networks,
   are composed by a network with a single Ethernet link, a "plug-and-play"
   router, and an uplink to a single provider.   The DNSR option provides
   a standard mechanism for advertising DNS Resolver IPv6 address within
   such sites.


2. Terminology

4. Protocol overview

4.1. Deployment scenario

   The DNSR option should be send within Router Advertisements so as to
   complete stateless address autoconfiguration. All nodes connected to a
   same link might use the DNSR option to configure the IPv6 addresses of
   available DNS resolvers those nodes might use for DNS resolutions. 

            +--------+
            | Router |
            +--------+
                 | link
                 |
        ------------------------
        |       |      |       |
      Node1   Node2  Node3   Node4
         

   In such a network, the router allows the node to use stateless
   address autoconfiguration and may send unsolicited Router
   Advertisement.

   A DNS resolver may or not be connected to the link.

   A typical deployment scenario could be a small network on which several
   hosts would be connected to a single router. And that router would
   interconnect that single-subnet network to an ISP.

4.2. Node operation

4.2.1 Active mode

   If a node wants to learn the IPv6 addresses of available DNS 
   resolvers, it SHOULD send a "DNS resolver Query". A "DNS resolver 
   Query" is a Router solicitation with a DNSR option.

4.2.2 Passive mode

   On any link a node MUST listen to Router Advertisements (DISCOVERY].
   By that way a node may learn the IPv6 addresses of available DNS 
   resolvers in the case another node has just query for such an 
   information, and that a router has just replied by a Routeur
   Advertisement including a DNSR option. 

4.3. Router operation

   The way the router learns IPv6 addresses of reachable DNS resolver is 
   out the scope of that document. That could be achieved typically by an 
   access control protocol, DHCP or manual configuration.

   The router MUST reply to a "DNS resolver query" by sending a "DNS 
   Resolver Reply". A "DNS Resolver Reply" is a router advertisement with 
   DNSR option.

   IPv6 address included in the DNSR option MUST not have a scope larger
   than the largest scope of the prefixes advertised in the Router
   Advertisement. For example, if the Router Advertisement advertises only
   site-local prefixes, DNSR option MUST not include global-scope IPv6
   addresses, but only local-scope or site-local-scope addresses.
