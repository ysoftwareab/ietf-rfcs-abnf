    Addition of organisation prefix to RFC6690 IANA CoRE parameters
                              registration
                     draft-groves-core-rfc6690up-00

Abstract

   [RFC6690] defines the resource type 'rt' and interface description
   'if' link attributes and defines procedures for registering values.
   Currently each 'rt' and 'if' attribute value must be registered with
   IANA.  This specification updates the process to enable organisation
   prefixes to be registered allowing organisations to manage their own
   namespace within a certain set of rules.

1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   [RFC6690] "Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format"
   defines the Resource Type 'rt' and Interface Description 'if' link
   attributes.  In order to co-ordinate the use of these attributes,
   sections 7.4 and 7.5/[RFC6690] establish IANA registries to register
   link attribute values for 'rt' and 'if'.

   In order to register a new 'rt' and 'if' link attribute value the
   [RFC5226] "Specification Required" process is followed for each
   value.  As part of the process a designated expert will examine the
   specification to enforce a number of requirements including:

   o  Registration values MUST be related to the intended purpose of
      these attributes as described in Section 3/[RFC6690].

   o  Registered values MUST conform to the ABNF reg-rel-type definition
      of Section 2/[RFC6690], meaning that the value starts with a
      lowercase alphabetic character, followed by a sequence of
      lowercase alphabetic, numeric, ".", or "-" characters, and
      contains no white space.

   o  It is recommended that the period "." character be used for
      dividing name segments and that the dash "-" character be used for
      making a segment more readable.  Example Interface Description
      values might be "core.batch" and "core.link-batch".

   o  URIs are reserved for free use as extension values for these
      attributes and MUST NOT be registered.

   The IANA CoRE resource type and interface description registry can be
   found at: IANA CoRE Registry [1].

   Given the scope of the Internet of Things (IoT) the potential number
   of resource types (and to a lesser extent interface types) is
   potentially quite large.  This would lead to a large number of
   requests for designated expert review.  It would also mean additional
   work for the IANA to process each request.

   The current trend for the definition of resource types and interface
   descriptions is that a few standards organisations have defined a
   large number of values.

   For example the "OIC Resource Type Specification v1.1.0" [OICResSpec]
   contains 64 resource types.

   ETSI oneM2M also defines a large number of resource types.  For
   example is "Home Appliances Information Model and Mapping"
   [oneM2MTS0023].

   The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) also make use of resources types.

   The above three organisations also have their own registry and
   procedures for adding resource types.  Trying to keep the IANA
   registry aligned with the individual organisation registries would
   also add additional burden.

   A significant amount of work could be saved by allowing organisations
   to register a prefix under which they can administer their own
   resources negating the need for the IANA and the designated IANA
   expert to be involved for each resource registration.

   This specification updates the [RFC6690] IANA registration procedures
   to allow the possibility to register a pre-fix.

3.  Organisation Prefix

   As indicated by [RFC6690] registered values MUST conform to the ABNF
   reg-rel-type definition, meaning that the value starts with a
   lowercase alphabetic character.  Therefore an organisation

Internet-Draft        Prefix for CoRE parameter reg         October 2016


   registering a prefix MUST register a lowercase alphabetic sequence of
   characters.  It MUST be followed by a ".".

   For example: "foo."

   This will allocate the namespace "foo." to the organisation.  The
   organisation will then be responsible for maintaining resources
   within this name space.

   E.g. "foo.sensor", "foo.actuator" could be allocated without
   requiring registration with IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification updates the [RFC6690] IANA Considerations.  No
   additional protocol security impacts to what is already described in
   [RFC6690] are foreseen.

   The use of organisational prefixes introducing the possibility that
   people request prefixes for an organisation that they do not
   represent.  The IANA considerations in this specification require
   that the designated expert determine if the person requesting a
   prefix represents the organisation related to the prefix.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Parameters Registry Update

   This specification updates the Constrained RESTful Environments
   (CoRE) Parameter Registry by allowing the registration of an
   organisation prefix for Resource Type (rt=) and Interface Description
   (if=) Link Target Attribute values.

   Organisation prefixes are registered by using the Specification
   Required policy (see [RFC5226], which requires review by a designated
   expert appointed by the IESG or their delegate.

   The designated expert will enforce the following requirements:

   o The registered prefix MUST conform to the ABNF reg-rel-type
   definition of Section 2/[RFC6690], meaning that the value starts with
   a lowercase alphabetic character followed by a period ".".

   o The registered prefixes are assigned on a first come first served
   basis.

   o Prefixes must be requested by a representative of the organisation
   applying for the prefix and must be representative of the

   organisation.  E.g. organisation "foo" trying to register "ietf."
   would not be representative.

   The specification MUST:

   o  Specify the procedures for registering values within the prefixed
      namespace.  It ideally SHOULD provide a link where current and
      future registered values may be found.

   o  Indicate that registered values within the prefixed namespace MUST
      conform to the ABNF reg-rel-type definition of
      Section 2/[RFC6690].  This means that the prefix MUST be followed
      by a sequence of lowercase alphabetic, numeric, ".", or "-"
      characters, and contains no white space.  Note: It is not
      recommended to immediately follow the prefix with an additional
      period ".", e.g. "foo..".

   o  Use the recommendation that the period "." character be used for
      dividing name segments and that the dash "-" character be used for
      making a segment more readable.  Example Interface Description
      values might be "core.batch" and "core.link-batch".

   Registration requests consist of the completed registration template
   below, with the reference pointing to the required specification.  To
   allow for the allocation of values prior to publication, the
   designated expert may approve registration once they are satisfied
   that a specification will be published.

   The registration template for both sub-registries is:

   o Prefix Value:

   o Description:

   o Reference:

   o Notes: [optional]

   Registration requests should be sent to the core-parameters@ietf.org
   mailing list, marked clearly in the subject line (e.g., "NEW RESOURCE
   TYPE PREFIX - example" to register an "example" relation type or "NEW
   INTERFACE DESCRIPTION PREFIX - example" to register an "example"
   Interface Description).

   Handling and the decision process is as per section 7.4/[RFC6690].
