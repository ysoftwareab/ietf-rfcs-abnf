1.  Introduction

   This document updates some OSPF terminology to be in line with
   inclusive language used in the industry.

   This document updates [RFC2328] and [RFC5340].

2.  Update to RFC2328

   The base OSPFv2 specification [RFC2328] defines the synchronization
   of databases as two routers froming a "master/slave relationship".
   All instances of these terms are replaced by leader/follower,
   respectively.

   The Master (MS) bit in the database description packet is renamed the
   Leader (L) bit.

   The operation of OSPFv2 is not modified.

3.  Update to RFC5340

   The base OSPFv3 specification [RFC5340] defines the database
   description process between two routers as one being "designated to
   be the master and the other is the slave".  All instances of these
   terms are replaced by leader/follower, respectively.

Internet-Draft              OSPF Terminology               February 2022


   The Master/Slave (MS) bit in the database description packet is
   renamed the Leader (L) bit.

   The operation of OSPFv3 is not modified.

4.  Acknowledgements

   TDB

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to rename bit 0x01 in the "Database Description
   (DD) Packet Flags" registry to "Leader (L-bit)" and to add a
   reference to this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document updates the terminology used in OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and
   OSPFv3 [RFC5340] without any modification to the specification of the
   protocol.  As such, the security characteristics of OSPF do not
   change.
