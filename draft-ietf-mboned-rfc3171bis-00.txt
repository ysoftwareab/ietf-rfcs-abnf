1.  Introduction


   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) (www.iana.org) is
   charged with allocating parameter values for fields in protocols
   which have been designed, created or are maintained by the Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF).  RFC 2780 [RFC2780] provides the IANA
   guidance in the assignment of parameters for fields in newly
   developed protocols. This memo expands on section 4.4.2 of RFC 2780
   and attempts to codify existing IANA practice used in the assignment
   IPv4 multicast addresses.




2.  Definition of Current Assignment Practice


   Unlike IPv4 unicast address assignment, where blocks of addresses are
   delegated to regional registries, IPv4 multicast addresses are
   assigned directly by the IANA.  Current assignments appear as follows
   [IANA]:

   224.0.0.0   - 224.0.0.255     (224.0.0/24)  Local Network Control Block
   224.0.1.0   - 224.0.1.255     (224.0.1/24)  Internetwork Control Block
   224.0.2.0   - 224.0.255.0                   AD-HOC Block
   224.1.0.0   - 224.1.255.255   (224.1/16)    RESERVED
   224.2.0.0   - 224.2.255.255   (224.2/16)    SDP/SAP Block
   224.3.0.0   - 231.255.255.255               RESERVED
   232.0.0.0   - 232.255.255.255 (232/8)       Source Specific Multicast Block
   233.0.0.0   - 233.255.255.255 (233/8)       GLOP Block
   234.0.0.0   - 238.255.255.255               RESERVED
   239.0.0.0   - 239.255.255.255 (239/8)       Administratively Scoped Block


   The IANA generally assigns addresses from the Local Network Control,
   Internetwork Control, and AD-HOC blocks. Assignment guidelines for
   each of these blocks, as well as for the Source Specific Multicast,
   GLOP and Administratively Scoped Blocks, are described below.



3.  Local Network Control Block (224.0.0/24)


   Addresses in the Local Network Control block are used for protocol
   control traffic that is not forwarded off link. Examples of this type
   of use include OSPFIGP All Routers (224.0.0.5) [RFC2328].



Albanna, Almeroth, Meyer, and Schipper              Section 3.  [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT              Expires: May 2004              November 2003


3.1.  Assignment Guidelines


   Pursuant to section 4.4.2 of RFC 2780 [RFC2780], assignments from the
   Local Network Control block follow an Expert Review, IESG Approval or
   Standards Action process. See [IANA] for the current set of
   assignments.



4.  Internetwork Control Block (224.0.1/24)


   Addresses in the Internetwork Control block are used for protocol
   control that must be forwarded through the Internet. Examples include
   224.0.1.1 (NTP [RFC2030]) and 224.0.1.68 (mdhcpdiscover [RFC2730]).



4.1.  Assignment Guidelines


   Pursuant to section 4.4.2 of RFC 2780 [RFC2780], assignments from the
   Internetwork Control block follow an Expert Review, IESG Approval or
   Standards Action process. See [IANA] for the current set of
   assignments.



5.  AD-HOC Block (224.0.2/24 - 224.0.255/24)


   Addresses in the AD-HOC block have traditionally been assigned for
   those applications that don't fit in either the Local or Internetwork
   Control blocks. These addresses are globally routed and are typically
   used by applications that require small blocks of addressing (e.g.,
   less than a /24).



5.1.  Assignment Guidelines


   In general, the IANA SHOULD NOT assign addressing in the AD-HOC
   Block.  However, the IANA may under special special circumstances,
   assign addressing from this block. Pursuant to section 4.4.2 of RFC
   2780 [RFC2780], assignments from the AD-HOC block follow an Expert
   Review, IESG Approval or Standards Action process. See [IANA] for the



Albanna, Almeroth, Meyer, and Schipper            Section 5.1.  [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT              Expires: May 2004              November 2003


   current set of assignments.



6.  SDP/SAP Block (224.2/16)


   Addresses in the SDP/SAP block are used by applications that receive
   addresses through the Session Announcement Protocol [RFC2974] for use
   via applications like the session directory tool (such as SDR [SDR]).



6.1.  Assignment Guidelines


   Since addresses in the SDP/SAP block are chosen randomly from the
   range of addresses not already in use [RFC2974], no IANA assignment
   policy is required. Note that while no additional IANA assignment is
   required, addresses in the SDP/SAP block are explicitly for use by
   SDP/SAP and MUST NOT be used for other purposes.



7.  Source Specific Multicast Block (232/8)


   The Source Specific Multicast (SSM) is an extension of IP Multicast
   in which traffic is forwarded to receivers from only those multicast
   sources for which the receivers have explicitly expressed interest,
   and is primarily targeted at one-to-many (broadcast) applications.
   Note that this block as initially assigned to the VMTP transient
   groups [IANA].



7.1.  Assignment Guidelines


   Because the SSM model essentially makes the entire multicast address
   space local to the host, no IANA assignment policy is required. Note,
   however, that while no additional IANA assignment is required,
   addresses in the SSM block are explicitly for use by SSM and MUST NOT
   be used for other purposes.

INTERNET-DRAFT              Expires: May 2004              November 2003


8.  GLOP Block (233/8)


   Addresses in the GLOP block are globally scoped statically assigned
   addresses. The assignment is made by mapping a domain's autonomous
   system number into the middle two octets of 233.X.Y.0/24. The mapping
   and assignment is defined in [RFC2770].



8.1.  Assignment Guidelines


   Because addresses in the GLOP block are algorithmically pre-assigned,
   no IANA assignment policy is required. In addition, RFC 3138
   [RFC3138] delegates assignment of the GLOP sub-block mapped by the
   RFC 1930 [RFC1930] private AS space (233.252.0.0 - 233.255.255.255)
   to the Internet Routing Registries. Note that while no additional
   IANA assignment is required, addresses in the GLOP  block are
   assigned for use as defined in RFC 2770 and MUST NOT be used for
   other purposes.



9.  Administratively Scoped Address Block (239/8)


   Addresses in the Administratively Scoped Address block are for local
   use within a domain and are described in [RFC2365].



9.1.  Assignment Guidelines


   Since addresses in this block are local to a domain, no IANA
   assignment policy is required.



9.1.1.  Relative Offsets


   The relative offsets [RFC2365] are used to ensure that a service can
   be located independent of the extent of the enclosing scope (see RFC
   2770 for details). Since there are only 256 such offsets, the IANA
   should only assign a relative offset to a protocol that provides an
   infrastructure supporting service. Examples of such services include



Albanna, Almeroth, Meyer, and Schipper          Section 9.1.1.  [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT              Expires: May 2004              November 2003


   the Session Announcement Protocol [RFC2974]. Pursuant to section
   4.4.2 of RFC 2780 [RFC2780], assignments of Relative Offsets follow
   an Expert Review, IESG Approval or Standards Action process. See
   [IANA] for the current set of assignments.



10.  Annual Review


   Given the dynamic nature of IPv4 multicast and its associated
   infrastructure, and the previously undocumented IPv4 multicast
   address assignment guidelines, the IANA should conduct an annual
   review of currently assigned addresses.



10.1.  Address Reclamation


   During the review described above, addresses that were mis-assigned
   should, where possible, be reclaimed or reassigned.

   The IANA should also review assignments reclaim those addresses that
   are not in use on the global Internet (i.e, those applications which
   can use SSM, GLOP, or Administratively Scoped addressing, or are not
   globally routed).



11.  Use of IANA Reserved Addresses


   Applications MUST NOT use addressing in the IANA reserved blocks.


12.  Intellectual Property


   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it
   has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the
   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and
   standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11 [RFC2028].
   Copies of claims of rights made available for publication and any

   assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an
   attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use of
   such proprietary rights by implementors or users of this
   specification can be obtained from the IETF Secretariat.

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
