Abstract 
 
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control allows 
   each network element (NE) to perform local resource discovery (e.g., 
   LMP), routing (e.g., OSPF-TE) and signaling (e.g., RSVP-TE) in a 
   distributed manner.  

   On the other hand, with the development of software-defined 
   transport networking technology, a set of NEs can be controlled via 
   centralized controller hierarchies to address the issue from multi-
   domain, multi-vendor and multi-technology. An example of such 
   centralized architecture is ACTN controller hierarchy [I-D.ietf-
   teas-actn-framework].   

   Instead of competing with each other, both the distributed and the 
   centralized control plane have their own advantage, and should be 
   complementary in the system. This document describes how the GMPLS 
   distributed control plane can interwork with a centralized 
   controller system in a transport network.

1. Introduction 

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] extends 
   MPLS to support different classes of interfaces and switching 
   capabilities such as Time-Division Multiplex Capable (TDM), Lambda 
   Switch Capable (LSC), and Fiber-Switch Capable (FSC). Each network 
   element (NE) running a GMPLS control plane collects network 
   information from other NEs and supports service provisioning through 
   signaling in a distributed manner. 

   On the other hand, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technologies 
   have been introduced to control the transport network in a 
   centralized manner. Central controllers can collect network 
   information from each node and provision services to corresponding 
   nodes. One of the examples is the Abstraction and Control of Traffic 
   Engineered Networks (ACTN) [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-framework], which 
   defines a hierarchical architecture with PNC, MDSC and CNC as 
   central controllers for different network abstraction levels. 

   In such centralized controller architectures, GMPLS can be applied 
   for the NE-level control. A central controller may support GMPLS 
   enabled domains and may interact with a GMPLS enabled domain where 
   the GMPLS control plane does the service provisioning from ingress 
   to egress. In this case the centralized controller sends the request 
   to the ingress node and does not have to configure all NEs along the 
   path through the domain from ingress to egress thus leveraging the 
   GMPLS control plane. This document describes how GMPLS control 
   interworks with centralized controller system in transport network.

2. Overview 

   In this section, overviews of GMPLS control plane and centralized 
   controller system are discussed as well as the interactions between 
   the GMPLS control plane and centralized controllers. 

2.1. Overview of GMPLS Control Plane 

   GMPLS separates the control plane and the data plane to support 
   time-division, wavelength, and spatial switching, which are 
   significant in transport networks. For the NE level control in 
   GMPLS, each node runs a GMPLS control plane instance. 
   Functionalities such as service provisioning, protection, and 
   restoration can be performed via GMPLS communication among multiple 
   NEs.  At the same time, the controller can also collect node and 
   link resources in the network to construct the network topology and 
   compute routing paths for serving service requests. 

   Several protocols have been designed for GMPLS control [RFC3945] 
   including link management [RFC4204], signaling [RFC3471], and 
   routing [RFC4202] protocols. The controllers applying these 
   protocols communicate with each other to exchange resource 
   information and establish LSP. In this way, controllers in different 
   nodes in the network have the same network topology and provision 
   services based on local policies. 

2.2. Overview of Centralized Controller System 

   With the development of SDN technologies, a centralized controller 
   architecture has been introduced to transport networks such as ACTN 
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-framework]. In centralized controller system, a 
   controller is aware of the network topology and is responsible for 
   provisioning incoming service requests. In ACTN, multiple 
   abstraction levels are designed and controllers at different levels 
   implement different functions. This kind of abstraction enables 
   multi-vendor, multi-domain, and multi-technology control. 

   For example in ACTN, an MDSC coordinates several PNCs controlling 
   different domains. Each PNC provides a topological view of the 
   domain it controls, which can be abstracted, to the MDSC, so that 
   the MDSC learns the topology of the network encompassing multiple 
   domains. When a multi-domain service request arrives at the MDSC, 
   the MDSC first computes an end-to-end path based on the abstracted 
   topology view provided by the PNCs. Then, the MDSC splits this path 
   to multiple segment according to domain boundaries and allocate each 
   segment to corresponding PNC for detailed path computation and LSP 
   segment setup. When each PNC has reported the establishment of its 
   LSP segment, the multi-domain service is established.

2.3. GMPLS Control Interwork with Centralized Controller System 

   The ACTN framework [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-framework] defines a 
   hierarchical controller architecture and describes how these 
   controllers communicate with each other in order to control a multi-
   domain transport network. The controllers at the different levels in 
   the hierarchy typically perform network abstraction of the domain 
   they control and provide an abstracted view of their domain to the 
   controller at the next level in the hierarchy. The controllers at 
   the different hierarchical levels also interact with each other 
   during end-to-end service establishment, which can span multiple 
   domains. Within each domain, GMPLS control can be applied to each 
   NE. The bottom-level central controller like PNC can act as a NE to 
   collect network information and initiate LSP. Following figure shows 
   an example of GMPLS interworking with ACTN.

   protocol messages (OSPF LSAs for example) that the GMPLS control 
   plane instances are disseminating into the network and thus learn 
   the network topology. For path computation in the domain with PNC 
   implementing a PCE, PCCs (e.g. NEs, other controller/PCE) use PCEP 
   to ask the PNC for a path and get replies. The MDSC communicates 
   with PNCs using for example REST/RESTConf based on YANG data models. 
   As a PNC has learned its domain topology, it can report the topology 
   to the MDSC. When a service arrives, the MDSC computes the path and 
   coordinates PNCs to establish the corresponding LSP segment. 

   Alternatively, the NETCONF protocol can be used to retrieve topology 
   information utilizing the [TE-TOPO] Yang model and the technology-
   specific YANG model augmentations required for the specific network 
   technology. The PNC can retrieve topology information from any NE 
   (the GMPLS control plane instance of each NE in the domain has the 
   same topological view), construct the topology of the domain and 
   export an abstracted view to the MDSC. Based on the topology 
   retrieved from multiple PNCs, the MDSC can create topology graph of 
   the multi-domain network, and can use it for path computation. To 
   setup a service, the MDSC can exploit Yang tunnel model together 
   with the technology-specific YANG model augmentations.  

3. Link Management Protocol 

   Link management protocol (LMP) [RFC4204] runs between a pair of 
   nodes and is used to manage TE links. In addition to setup and 
   maintain control channels, LMP can be used to verify the data link 
   connectivity and correlate the link property. In this way, link 
   resources, which are fundamental resources in the network, are 
   discovered by both ends of the link. 

4. Routing Options 

   In GMPLS control, link state information is flooded within the 
   network as defined in [RFC4202]. Each node in the network can build 
   the network topology according to the flooded link state 
   information. Routing protocols such as OSPF-TE [RFC4203] and ISIS-TE 
   [RFC5307] have been extended to support different interfaces in 
   GMPLS. 

   In centralized controller system, central controller can be placed 
   at the GMPLS network and passively receive the information flooded 
   in the network. In this way, the central controller can construct 
   and update the network topology.  

4.1. OSPF-TE 

   OSPF-TE is introduced for TE networks in [RFC3630]. OSPF extensions 
   have been defined in [RFC4203] to enable the capability of link

   state information for GMPLS network. Based on this work, OSPF 
   protocol has been extended to support technology-specific routing. 
   The routing protocol for OTN, WSON and optical flexi-grid network 
   are defined in [RFC7138], [RFC7688] and [I-D.ietf-ccamp-flexible-
   grid-ospf-ext], respectively. 

4.2. ISIS-TE 

   ISIS-TE is introduced for TE networks in [RFC5305] and is extended 
   to support GMPLS routing functions [RFC5307], and has been updated 
   to [RFC7074] to support the latest GMPLS switching capability and 
   Types fields. 

4.3. Netconf/RESTconf 

   Netconf [RFC6241] and RESTconf [RFC8040] protocols are originally 
   used for network configuration. Besides, these protocols can also be 
   used for topology retrieval by using topology-related YANG models, 
   such as [RFC8345] and [TE-topo]. These protocols provide a powerful 
   mechanism for notification that permits to notify the client about 
   topology changes.  

5. Path Computation 

   Once a controller learn the network topology, it can utilize the 
   available resources to serve service requests by performing path 
   computation. Due to abstraction, the MDSC may not have sufficient 
   information to compute the optimal path. In this case, the MDSC can 
   interact with different domain controllers by sending Yang Path 
   Computation requests [PAT-COMP] to compute a set of potential 
   optimal paths and then, based on its own constraints, policy and 
   specific knowledge (e.g. cost of access link) can choose the more 
   feasible path for service e2e path setup.  

   Path computation is one of the key objectives in various types of 
   controllers. In the given architecture, it is possible for different 
   components that have the capability to compute the path.  

5.1. Constraint-based Path Computing in GMPLS Control 

   In GMPLS control, a routing path is computed by the ingress node 
   [RFC3473] and is based on the ingress node TED. Constraint-based 
   path computation is performed according to the local policy of the 
   ingress node. 

5.2. Path Computation Element (PCE) 

   PCE has been introduced in [RFC4655] as a functional component that 
   provides services to compute path in a network. In [RFC5440], the 
 
 
Zheng                  Expires September 2018                 [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft        GMPLS and Controller Interwork        June 2018 


   path computation is accomplished by using the Traffic Engineering 
   Database (TED), which maintains the link resources in the network. 
   The emergence of PCE efficiently improve the quality of network 
   planning and offline computation, but there is a risk that the 
   computed path may be infeasible if there is a diversity requirement, 
   because stateless PCE has no knowledge about the former computed 
   paths.  

   To address this issue, stateful PCE has been proposed in [RFC8231]. 
   Besides the TED, an additional LSP Database (LSP-DB) is introduced 
   to archive each LSP computed by the PCE. In this way, PCE can easily 
   figure out the relationship between the computing path and former 
   computed paths. In this approach, PCE provides computed paths to 
   PCC, and then PCC decides which path is deployed and when to be 
   established.  

   In PCE Initiation [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp], PCE is allowed 
   to trigger the PCC to setup, maintenance, and teardown of the PCE-
   initiated LSP under the stateful PCE model. This would allow a 
   dynamic network that is centrally controlled and deployed. 

   In centralized controller system, the PCE can be implement in a 
   central controller, and the central controller performs path 
   computation according to its local policies. On the other hand, the 
   PCE can also be placed outside of the central controller. In this 
   case, the central controller acts as a PCC to request path 
   computation to the PCE through PCEP. 

6. Signaling Options 

   Signaling mechanism is used to setup LSPs in GMPLS control. Messages 
   are sent hop by hop between the ingress node and the egress node of 
   the LSP to allocate labels. Once the labels are allocated along the 
   path, the LSP setup is accomplished. Signaling protocols such as 
   RSVP-TE [RFC3473] and CR-LDP [RFC3472] have been extended to support 
   different interfaces in GMPLS. 

6.1. RSVP-TE 

   RSVP-TE is introduced in [RFC3209] and extended to support GMPLS 
   signaling in [RFC3473]. Several label formats are defined for a 
   generalized label request, a generalized label, suggested label and 
   label sets. Based on [RFC3473], RSVP-TE has been extended to support 
   technology-specific signaling. The RSVP-TE extensions for OTN, WSON, 
   optical flexi-grid network are defined in [RFC7139], [RFC7689], and 
   [RFC7792], respectively.

Internet-Draft        GMPLS and Controller Interwork        June 2018 


6.2. CR-LDP 

   In order to support the label formats and signaling mechanism 
   defined in [RFC3471], CR-LDP is extended in [RFC3472]. Several label 
   formats are defined and bidirectional LSPs are supported. 

7. Interworking Scenarios 

7.1. Topology Collection & Synchronization 

   Topology information is necessary on both network elements and 
   controllers. The topology on network element is usually raw 
   information, while the topology on the controller can be either raw 
   or abstracted. Three different abstraction method has been described 
   in [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-framework], and different controllers can 
   select the corresponding method depending on application.  

   When there are changes in the network topology, the impacted network 
   element(s) need to report changes to all the other network elements, 
   together with the controller, to sync up the topology information. 
   The inter-NE synchronization can be achieved via protocols mentioned 
   in section 3 and 4. The topology synchronization between NEs and 
   controllers can either be achieved by routing protocols OSPF-
   TE/PCEP-LS in [PCEP-LS] or Netconf protocol with YANG model.  

7.2. Multi-domain/layer Service Provisioning 

   Based on the topology information on controllers and network 
   elements, service provisioning can be deployed. Plenty of methods 
   have been specified for single domain service provisioning, such as 
   using PCEP and RSVP-TE.  

   Multi-domain/layer service provisioning would request coordination 
   among the controller hierarchies. Given the service request, the 
   end-to-end delivery procedure may include interactions on MPI and 
   SBI. The computation for a cross-domain/layer path is usually 
   completed by MDSC, who has a global view of the topologies. Then the 
   configuration is decomposed into lower layer controllers, including 
   both MDSC and PNCs, to configure the network elements to set up the 
   path.  

   A combination of the centralized and distributed protocols may be 
   necessary for the interaction between network elements and 
   controller. A typical example would be the PCE Initiation scenario, 
   in which a PCE message (PCInitiate) is sent from the controller to 
   the first-end node, and then trigger a RSVP procedure along the 
   path. Similarly, the interaction between the controller and the 
   ingress node of a domain can be achieved by Netconf protocol with

Internet-Draft        GMPLS and Controller Interwork        June 2018 


   corresponding YANG models, and then completed by running RSVP among 
   the network elements.  

7.3. Recovery  

   The GMPLS recovery functions are described in [RFC4426]. Two models, 
   span protection and end-to-end protection and restoration, are 
   discussed with different protection schemes and message exchange 
   requirements. Related RSVP-TE extensions to support end-to-end 
   recovery is described in [RFC4872]. The extensions in [RFC4872] 
   include protection, restoration, preemption, and rerouting 
   mechanisms for an end-to-end LSP. Besides end-to-end recovery, a 
   GMPLS segment recovery mechanism is defined in [RFC4873]. By 
   introducing secondary record route objects, LSP segment can be 
   switched to another path like fast reroute [RFC4090]. 

   For the recovery with controllers, timely interaction between 
   controller and network elements are required. Usually the re-routing 
   can be decomposed into path computation and delivery, the controller 
   can take some advantage in the path computation due to the global 
   topology view. And the delivery can be achieved by the procedure 
   described in section 7.2.  

7.4. Controller Reliability  

   Given the important role in the network, the reliability of 
   controller is critical. Once a controller is shut down, the network 
   should operate as well. It can be either achieved by controller back 
   up or functionality back up. There are several of controller backup 
   or federation mechanisms in the literature. It is also more reliable 
   to have some function back up in the network element, to guarantee 
   the performance in the network.
