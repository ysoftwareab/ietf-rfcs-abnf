Abstract

   As network virtualization is opening the gate to much more innovative
   services for service providers, Service Function Chaining (SFC)
   provides a flexible way of service provisioning and facilitates their
   deployments.

   This document provides a general abstract architecture for service
   chaining. It is a flexible and scalable architecture which can
   fulfill requirements of SFC. Some solutions based on this
   architecture are also discussed and compared. This architecture can
   be used as a guideline and also a criterion for the design of SFC.

1. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



2. Terminology

   Service Flow: packets/frames with specific service characteristics
   (e.g., packets matching a specific tuple of fields in Ethernet, IP,
   TCP, HTTP headers and etc.) or determined by some service policies
   (such as access port and etc.)

   Service Classifier (SCLA), an entity which can classify incoming
   packets/frames into different service flows based on their service
   characteristics or some policies.

   Service Function (SF):  a logical entity which can provide one or
   more service processing functions for packets/frames such as firewall,
   DPI (Deep Packet Inspection), LI (Lawful Intercept) and etc. Usually
   these processing functions are computation intensive. This entity may
   also provide packet/frame encapsulation/decapsulation capability.

   Service Chain (SC): one or more service processing functions in a
   specific order which are chained together to provide a composite
   service, and packets/frames from one or more service flow should
   follow and be processed in sequence.

   Service Chaining Domain: a domain where packet is forwarded using
   service chaining mechanism.

   Service Forwarding Entity (SFE): a logical entity which forwards
   packets/frames to SFs attached to this SFE or other SFEs in the same
   service chain. Optionally, it provides mapping, insertion and removal
   of header(s) in packets/frames. Note service forwarding path may not
   be the shortest path to its destination.

   Service Function Chaining (SFC): a mechanism of building service chains
   and forwarding packets/frames of service flows through them.

3. Introduction

   With the maturity of hardware/software in network virtualization, it
   is possible for service providers to provide more innovative services.

Internet-Draft      Service Chaining Architecture        February 2014


   Service chaining provides a flexible way to construct services, e.g.,
   it is easy to insert/remove, and upgrade service processing functions
   for a service in this framework. It is thus possible to define very
   complex services over heterogeneous networks in a consistent way with
   the help of service chaining.

   Several drafts have already been proposed for service chaining with
   different approaches ([NLFC], [NSH] and [L3VPNSC]) and more solutions
   are expected to emerge in the near future.

   This document provides architecture and abstraction of the critical
   components for service function chaining, and it is hoped to shed
   some lights on the design of service chaining. Possible solutions of
   service chaining are also outlined and compared in this document so
   that they can be gauged under the same criterion.

Internet-Draft      Service Chaining Architecture        February 2014


4. Service Chaining Architecture

   In order to decouple the service from the networks, three layers of
   protocols are envisioned in the stack of SFC:

   -Service layer;

   -SFC forwarding layer;

   -Network under layer.

   In the Service Layer, service functions may be provided with metadata
   capability, but they may also behave like the traditional network
   devices such as firewall or DPI. Therefore, a null or service layer
   encapsulation/decapsulation may be needed.

   In the SFC forwarding layer, a Sevice Chain (SC) can be abstracted to
   consist of the following components:

   - At least one Service CLAssifier (SCLA), which classifies incoming
      packets/frames into different service flows based on their service
      characteristics or some policies;

   - One or more Service Forwarding Entities (SFEs), which make up the
      forwarding path of a SC, and each SFE is attached with one or more
      Service Functions.

   - One or more Service Functions (SFs), which are connected with SFEs
      and provide various service processing functions for a SC.

   Service chaining architecture with a single SFE is demonstrated in
   Figure 1. Upon their entry into a service chaining domain,
   packets/frames are classified by SCLA into different service flows.
   Then packets/frames from a specific service flow are forwarded by SFE
   into one or more SFs in a service chain in correct order. Upon
   completion of all service processing, they exit the service chaining
   domain. It should be noted that SCLA, SFE, and even SFs can be
   implemented in a single network element.

   The Network under layer such as IP, MPLS, and Ethernet provides the
   traditional transport (routing and switching) capability for the SCs.
   Interconnections between SFs and their SFEs, and between SFE peers
   can be a physical/logical link or a network path which may be an
   Ethernet or IP/MPLS underlay network. Ethernet, IP/MPLS or other

   tunneling technologies such as those being in progress in NVO3
   workgroup can be used for this underlay network.

5. Service Chaining Topology

   SCLA, SF and SFE can be implemented as a standalone network entity,
   or in a network entity combined with other functions (such as one SFE
   plus one or more SFs, one SCLA plus one SFE, or one SCLA plus one SFE
   and one or more SFs). Furthermore, they may be implemented as
   software modules running in a DC, in clouds or as standalone physical
   equipments.

   Following service chaining topologies can be supported by this
   architecture:

   -Daisy chain

   This is a type of service chain in the shape of a daisy, as
   demonstrated in Figure 1, where multiple SFs are attached to a single
   SFE, and SFs cannot send packets/frames directly to each other but
   via one shared SFE.



   -Lily chain

   This is a type of service chain in the shape of a lily. It can be
   regarded as a simplified form of Figure 2, where only a single SF is
   attached to each SFE, and the SFEs are connected from one to another
   in sequence.

   -Hybrid chain

   Part of a hybrid chain may be Daisy chain and other parts may be Lily
   chain, thus it can be readily combined by the previous two.

   More complex service chains can be constructed by reclassification of
   a SC (for example, by providing multiple SCLAs in a SC); or by change
   of the metadata in a SF (thus enforce a change to its forwarding
   paradigm).

6. Service Chaining Construction

   Attachment of SFs onto an SFE could be pre-configured on the SFE; or
   updated by some auto discovery and registering procedure when an SF
   first attaches to it.

6.1. Service chaining Controller

   A service chaining controller which centrally manages service chains
   (e.g., set up, remove, and monitor service chains) can be implemented
   together with an SDN controller or a network orchestrator. OSS may
   also be used as a platform to provide this kind of control function.

   In service layer, a Service Graph (SG) shall be defined for each
   Service Chain (SC), which consists of a list of Service Functions and
   their order, and parameters for the service flow over the SC.

   In service forwarding layer, a Service Forwarding Graph (SFG) shall
   be defined for each Service Chain, which consists of a list of
   Service Functions and SFEs between them.

   The service chaining controller is responsible for mapping a SG to a
   SFG, installing/updating/removing classification tables on/from the
   SCLAs, and installing/updating/removing service forwarding tables
   on/from the SFEs.

   A northbound RESTful API can be specified for the SC controller to
   manage and control SCs over the web.



7. Availability and Scalability of Service Chaining

   Two options for load balancing are possible:

   -Load balancing on flows

   It is very convenient to provide load balancing and make it scalable
   in this architecture: construct multiple service chains which provide
   the same set of service processing functions; the SCLA classifies a
   service flow into sub-flows, and each sub-flow is directed into a
   different service chain.

   -Load balancing on SFs/paths

   It is also possible to provide load balancing in finer granularity.
   Such as, provide multiple SFs with the same service processing
   function if a compute bottleneck is expected or found for this
   service processing function; provide multiple paths between a pair of
   SFEs if shortage of bandwidth is expected or found for the single
   path between them. The SFE should be able to load balance a service
   flow over these SFs or paths with some pre-determined algorithms.

Internet-Draft      Service Chaining Architecture        February 2014


   High availability of a service chain will be discussed in a next
   version.



8. Service Chaining Solution Considerations

   A solution must be able to classify packets/frames into different
   service flows. This is done by the Service Classifier (a packet/frame
   is classified with a tuple of fields in one or more headers or local
   policy). After the classification, a Service Identification (SID) may
   be applied to the packet/frame so that no further classification is
   needed in subsequent SFEs. SID can be mapped to traditional header
   fields such as a VLAN or an MPLS label (hence VLAN mapping or MPLS
   label swap is needed), or carried in a new service header (hence an
   extra header is inserted).

   A solution must be able to forward packets/frames across all service
   processing entities in a service chain in a correct sequence. This is
   done by the service forwarding entity with the help of SID.

   A solution should support the exchange of information between service
   processing entity and the service forwarding entity. For example, the
   processing result of a packet in a service processing entity can be
   encoded in a service header in the packets. But for long term service
   states (which can influence the processing of multiple
   packets/frames), they can be locally stored and/or signaled to
   service forwarding entity or other service processing entities by
   some specific control channels (e.g., OpenFlow protocol).

   [REQ] outlines a suite of requirements for service function chaining.

   Possible solutions for service chaining are outlined in the following
   sub-sections.

8.1. Ethernet compatible solution

   Ethernet technology (IEEE 802.1Q, 802.1ad, and etc.) or DC technology
   can be used to support service chaining. SCLA maps service ID of a
   service flow to a VLAN (e.g., C-VLAN and S-VLAN) ID or a VXLAN ID in
   a frame. SFE then forwards the frame with the VLAN ID to appropriate
   SFs for service processing (may need to change VLAN ID for each SF).

   The issue with this solution: its service chaining layer is entangled
   with its transport layer, thus planning and provisioning of service
   chains are complex, and it may not be a scalable solution to be used



Jiang, et al           Expires August 14, 2014                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      Service Chaining Architecture        February 2014


   in a large network since VLAN ID or VXLAN ID space is shared by both
   service ID and tunnel ID.

8.2. IP/MPLS compatible solution

   MPLS can be used to support service chaining - only an MPLS label is
   needed to represent SID of a service flow. Service ID of a service
   flow is mapped to an MPLS label in the packets by the SCLA. SFE then
   forwards frames with the label to appropriate SFs for service
   processing (may need to swap the label for each SF).

   [L3VPNSC] demonstrates how service topology specific Route Targets
   can be introduced into BGP/MPLS VPN to support automatic signaling of
   service chaining.

   Similarly, L2VPN may be crafted to support service chaining.

8.3. Solution of Network-Located Function Chaining (NLFC)

   [NLFC] proposes a solution of using NLFC Map (an ordered list of NLF
   identifiers) for service chaining, where a packet carries a map index
   of its service chain, then NLF nodes forward the packet by looking up
   the map index in locally stored NLFC Policy Table for its next NLF
   node.

8.4. Solution with a standalone service header

   A standalone service header can provide an independent layer of
   protocol data unit, so that service specific information such as SID
   can be carried over all kinds of underlay networks with no need of
   mapping.

   [NSH] proposes a new Network Service Header for service chaining,
   which consists of a Base Header and a Context Header.

   [SCHM] also introduces a simple service chaining header and how to
   use it to build service chains.

9. Security Considerations

   This document proposes architecture for the service chaining,
   outlines several types of its topology, and discusses possible
   approaches in this domain, thus no security issue is raised at
   present. It was expected that further solutions for these
   requirements will deal with security considerations specifically.
