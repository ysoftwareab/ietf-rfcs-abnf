1. Introduction 
    
   Recently, the deployment of a GMPLS network is planned or under 
   investigation among many service providers and some of very advanced 
   research networks have been already operated based on GMPLS 
   technology.  GMPLS is developed as an extension of MPLS in order to 
   mainly control a transport network consisting of TDM cross-connect, 
   optical/lambda switches, and fibers.  By introducing GMPLS technology, 
   some service providers expect that IP/MPLS network connectivity is 
   effectively and reliably established over the GMPLS network.  If MPLS 
   and GMPLS protocols can interwork with each other, the introduction 
   of GMPLS would be more beneficial for service providers, because this 
   is expected to improve the resource utilization, network resiliency 
   and manageability all over the network, less impacting the existing 
   IP/MPLS networks. 
    
   On the other hand, GMPLS protocols additionally define the packet 
   switch capable mechanism, although existing MPLS networks already 
   achieve the almost same functionalities and are being well-operated.  
   Some service providers are considering to gradually replace all the 
   IP/MPLS routers with GMPLS routers or upgrade the software so as to 
   support GMPLS in conjunction with the introduction of GMPLS 
   controlled optical networks. 
    
   In both cases, there is no clear definition and standardization work 
   so far to interwork between IP/MPLS routers as well as GMPLS routers, 
   i.e. IP/MPLS networks and GMPLS networks.  In order to accelerate the 
   deployment of GMPLS technology, MPLS/GMPLS interworking is a key to 
   gain more benefit than without any interworking.   
    
   These types of network architecture to investigated, however, are 
   much varied among service providers, and as a result, the 
   requirements in support of those may be different from each other.  
   In order to create the definition of MPLS/GMPLS interworking 
   technology, the concrete requirement is preferably defined from the 
   point of operational experience of MPLS/GMPLS networks and future 
   view on these technologies by collecting the input and requirements 
   from various service providers.

   Considering such environment, this document focuses on the 
   requirement of IP/MPLS-GMPLS interworking especially in support of 
   GMPLS deployment.

   IP/MPLS network: Service Provider Network where MPLS switching 
                    capabilities and signaling control (e.g., ones  
                    described in [RFC3031]) are activated in addition  
                    to IP routing protocols.

3. Problem Statement  
    
   GMPLS technology is deployed or will be deployed in various forms to 
   provide a highly efficient transport for existing IP/MPLS network, 
   depending on the deployment model of each service provider. Some 
   service providers may allow the hybrid architecture of IP/MPLS and 
   GMPLS so that the introduction of GMPLS technology has less impact on 
   an existing IP/MPLS network with regard to routing instance, 
   addressing and the running software.  On the other hand, some service 
   providers may need to control almost all devices by a single control 
   plane of GMPLS, which may require the running software upgrade.     
   In order to operate such a hybrid network appropriately and 
   effectively, clear definition should be formulated so as to cover 
   each service provider's strategy.   
    
   In terms of MPLS/GMPLS signaling, although the created GMPLS LSP over 
   optical networks will be utilized by the IP/MPLS network, the clear 
   mechanism of how to use it has not yet been defined.  On the other 
   hand, if the routing mechanism is considered, the method to transport 
   routing information has not yet been also defined between IP/MPLS

   networks and GMPLS networks.  Feature richness of MPLS and GMPLS 
   technology allows service providers to use a set of options on how 
   GMPLS services can be used by IP/MPLS networks.   In this document, 
   the requirement for IP/MPLS-GMPLS interworking is presented with some 
   operations considerations associated with use of GMPLS services by 
   IP/MPLS networks. 
    
   Note that an IP/MPLS-GMPLS interworking to deploy GMPLS technology is 
   not only tentatively required for a migration from MPLS RSVP-TE to 
   GMPLS RSVP-TE but also permanently required for the use of LDP and 
   IGP (e.g. OSPF and IS-IS) instead of MPLS RSVP-TE in IP/MPLS networks.  
    
4. Reference model 
    
   The reference model used in this document is shown in Figure 1.  As 
   indicated in [RFC3945], the optical transport network consists of, 
   for example, GMPLS controlled OXCs and GMPLS-enabled IP/MPLS routers.

   IP/MPLS network connectivity is provided through GMPLS LSP which is 
   created between GMPLS routers.  In this document, the requirement how 
   the IP/MPLS network and the GMPLS network are interworked is 
   described in order to effectively operate the entire network and 
   smoothly deployed the GMPLS network. 
    
 
5. Application Scenario   
    
   This section describes three different scenarios to deploy GMPLS 
   technology. 
   From the deployment point of view, GMPLS architecture document lists  
   [RFC3945] three different scenarios in which GMPLS technology can be

   deployed: overlay, integrated and augmented. 
    
   The key difference among these models is how much and what kind of 
   network information can be shared between packet (e.g. PSC) and 
   optical (e.g. LSC) domains. 
    
   In this section, in case that GMPLS technology is deployed in 
   existing IP/MPLS networks, pros and cons of each model are discussed.  
       
5.1 Overlay model 
    
   In overlay model, all the devices in optical domains have no 
   visibility into others topology and/or routing information such as 
   packet network (e.g. IP/MPLS service network) and vice versa. 
   But IP/MPLS domain and optical domain can interact with signaling 
   operation. 
   Overlay model is suitable for such scenario, however it does not 
   offer the benefits of integrated model approach for efficient 
   resource utilization, optimal routing, and protection and restoration 
   between IP/MPLS and optical networks. 
   Note that some service providers need a way to make effective use  
   of GMPLS network resources (e.g. bandwidth, protection and recovery) 
   for the IP/MPLS service networks. 
      
5.2 Integrated model 
    
   In integrated model, since all the devices in optical domains and 
   IP/MPLS domains share the same topology and routing information with 
   the same IGP instance, it requires all the devices within peer model 
   to be MPLS/GMPLS aware. 
   This model is also suitable, where optical transport and IP/MPLS 
   service networks are operated by a single entity.  
   Currently, many service providers have traditionally built their  
   networks, where optical transport and IP/MPLS service networks belong  
   to different operation, management and ownership. The most important 
   thing is that service providers want to operate and manage their 
   networks independently, and deploy them without changing existing 
   IP/MPLS network topologies, protocols and scalability.  
   But in this model, in case that a lot of devices exist in a network, 
   there are scalability issues. Note that most of real service 
   providers have thousands or tens of thousands of devices in real 
   networks. 
    
5.3 Augmented model 
    
   Augmented model is suitable in the scenario, where optical transport 
   and IP/MPLS service networks are administrated by different entities 
   and the service provider would like to maintain a separation between

   IP/MPLS and Optical layers while getting the benefits of integrated 
   model approach. 
   In augmented model, as shown in figure 2, devices within optical 
   domains have no visibility into others topology and/or routing 
   information, except the border nodes. This will help augmented model 
   to accommodate both MPLS based or non-MPLS based service networks 
   connected to border nodes, as long as the border node in augmented 
   model can support GMPLS control plane. Only the border node can share 
   optical domains and IP/MPLS domains. Once IP/MPLS nodes signal to 
   border nodes, the border nodes make effective use of GMPLS network 
   resources (e.g. bandwidth, protection and recovery) for the IP/MPLS 
   service networks.   
   Note that an IP/MPLS routing instance and GMPLS routing instance have 
   different routing instances at a border node.   
   One of the main advantages of the augmented model in the context of  
   GMPLS deployment is that it does not require existing IP/MPLS 
   networks to be GMPLS aware. Only border nodes need to be upgraded  
   with the GMPLS functionality. In this fashion, the augmented model  
   renders itself for incremental deployment of the optical regions,  
   without requiring reconfiguration of existing areas/ASes, changing  
   operation of IGP and EGP or software upgrade of the existing IP/MPLS  
   service networks. 
   Furthermore, to deploy GMPLS technology without changing the existing 
   IP/MPLS networks as much as possible is desirable by simply 
   establishing a routing adjacency at IP/MPLS instance between border 
   nodes.

6. Detailed Requirements 
    
   This section describes detailed requirements for IP/MPLS-GMPLS 
   interworking in support of GMPLS deployment.

    Requirements for IP/MPLS-GMPLS interworking in support of GMPLS 
       deployment                                        February 2006 
 
 
    
6.1 Software Upgrade Requirement 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the way not to upgrade all IP/MPLS 
   routers to GMPLS capable routers. 
   Generally speaking, it is not practical to upgrade all IP/MPLS  
   routers to GMPLS capable routers in real service provider networks 
   due to a number of reasons. Especially, in case of accommodating 
   enterprise customers, it is difficult for service providers to 
   upgrade from IP/MPLS capable routers to GMPLS capable routers.  
   This means that some routers would not be upgraded to support GMPLS 
   and some routers would support it in the IP/MPLS production networks. 
    
6.2 Use of GMPLS network resources in IP/MPLS networks 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to make effective use of 
   GMPLS network resources (e.g. bandwidth, protection & recovery) by 
   the IP/MPLS service networks.   
   Most of service providers have different networks for various 
   services; their GMPLS deployment plans are to have these service 
   networks use a common GMPLS controlled optical network as a core 
   network of various services.  
    
6.3 Routing adjacency for IP/MPLS networks over GMPLS networks 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to establish a routing 
   adjacency at IP/MPLS instance between border nodes. 
   Most of service providers expect to deploy GMPLS technology without 
   changing the existing IP/MPLS networks as much as possible. In case 
   that GMPLS technology is deployed at a border node, the routing 
   adjacency at IP/MPLS instance between the border nodes is required. 
   Note that the routing adjacency is not established between IP/MPLS 
   routers in case of using FA-LSPs. 
    
6.4 Mapping routing information between IP/MPLS and GMPLS  
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to map routing information 
   between IP/MPLS and GMPLS. From an IP/MPLS routing domain point of 
   view, the routers in the IP/MPLS domain should be able to see a GMPLS 
   LSP as a link or TE link. Furthermore, they should be able to choose 
   an appropriate GMPLS LSP in GMPLS optical domain as a link or TE link.  
   In this case, routers in the IP/MPLS domain can choose a link or TE 
   link based on some policy such as optimality, diversity, protected or 
   QoS inferred. It would enable an IP/MPLS network operating LDP/IGP 
   (e.g. OSPF and IS-IS) as well as RSVP-TE to use GMPLS as an effective 
   transport network.

6.5 Mapping signaling information between MPLS and GMPLS 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to map signaling information 
   between MPLS and GMPLS. From an IP/MPLS signaling domain point of 
   view, the routers in IP/MPLS domain should be able to signal over 
   GMPLS optical domain. In this case, an interworking between MPLS and 
   GMPLS protocol is needed. Note that it is supposed that MPLS 
   signaling here is RSVP based signaling. 
    
6.6 Establishment of GMPLS LSPs triggered by end-to-end MPLS LSPs   
   signaling 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to establish end-to-end MPLS 
   LSPs over GMPLS network regardless of existence of FA-LSPs in GMPLS 
   network. When there are no FA-LSPs in it, they should be set up 
   triggered by the signaling of MPLS LSP. 
    
6.7 Establishment of end-to-end MPLS LSPs having diverse paths over  
   GMPLS network 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to establish end-to-end 
   LSPs having diverse paths including diverse GMPLS FA-LSPs 
   corresponding to the request of the head-end MPLS LSR for protection 
   of MPLS LSPs. The GMPLS network SHOULD assure the diversity of GMPLS 
   FA-LSPs, even if their ingress nodes in GMPLS network are different. 
    
6.8 Advertisement of TE / IP reachability information via GMPLS domain 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to control advertisements of 
   TE information and/or IP reachability information of IP/MPLS service 
   networks via GMPLS network regardless of existence of FA-LSPs. 
   The TE / IP reachability information within the same MPLS service 
   networks should be exchanged in order for a head end LSR of the MPLS 
   network to compute an LSP to a tail end LSR over the GMPLS network. 
   On the other hand, the TE / IP reachabality information SHOULD NOT be  
   advertised to the other IP/MPLS service networks in order to avoid 
   establishing undesirable connections. 
    
6.9 Selective advertisement of TE/IP reachability information via a  
   border node 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to distribute TE/IP 
   reachability information 
   from the GMPLS network to IP/MPLS networks selectively, which are 
   useful for the head-end MPLS routers to compute MPLS LSPs.

    Requirements for IP/MPLS-GMPLS interworking in support of GMPLS 
       deployment                                        February 2006 
 
 
6.10 Interworking of MPLS and GMPLS protection 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to select GMPLS protection 
   type with the option by protected MPLS LSPs.  
   If MPLS LSPs are protected using MPLS FRR [RFC4090], when an FRR  
   protected packet LSP is signaled, we should be able to select  
   protected FA-LSPs from GMPLS network. In terms of MPLS protection,  
   MPLS path message can include some flags in FAST REROUTE object  
   and SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object.   
   In terms of GMPLS protection, there are both signaling aspects  
   [RFC3471] [RFC3473] and routing aspects [RFC4202].  
    
6.11 Separation of IP/MPLS domain and GMPLS domain 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to separate IP/MPLS domain 
   and GMPLS domain.   
   Most of service providers have had different networks for every 
   service, where optical networks and IP/MPLS networks belong to 
   different operation, management and ownership. The most important 
   thing is that service providers want to operate and manage their 
   networks independently, and deploy them without changing existing 
   IP/MPLS network topologies and protocols and without affecting 
   scalability. 
    
6.12 Failure recovery 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide failure recovery in optical domain 
   without impacting IP/MPLS domain and vice versa.   
   Failure in optical routing domain SHOULD NOT affect services in  
   IP/MPLS routing domain and failure can be restored/repaired in  
   optical domain without impacting IP/MPLS domain and vice versa. 
   But in case that failure in optical domain associates with IP/MPLS 
   domain, some kind of notification of the failure may be transmitted 
   to IP/MPLS domain and vice versa.   
    
6.13 Complexity and Risks 
    
   The solution SHOULD NOT introduce unnecessary complexity to the 
   current operating network to such a degree that it would affect the 
   stability and diminish the benefits of deploying such a solution over 
   service provider networks. 
    
6.14 Scalability consideration 
    
   The solution MUST have a minimum impact on network scalability for 
   deploying GMPLS technology in the existing IP/MPLS networks.    
   Scalability of GMPLS deployment in the existing IP/MPLS networks MUST 
   address the following consideration.

   - the number of GMPLS capable node (e.g. the number of non-PSC GMPLS 
   capable node) 
   - the number of MPLS capable node 
   - the number of IP capable node 
   - the number of OSPF capable node 
   - the number of OSPF non-backbone area 
   - the number of BGP capable node 
    
6.15 Performance consideration 
    
   The solution SHOULD be evaluated with regard to the following 
   criteria. 
    
   - the number of routing instance 
   - Failure and restoration time 
   - Impact and scalability of the control plane due to added 
     overheads and so on 
   - Impact and scalability of the data/forwarding plane due to added 
     overheads and so on 
    
6.16 Management consideration 
    
   Manageability of GMPLS deployment in the existing IP/MPLS networks 
   MUST addresses the following consideration for section 6. 
    
   - need for a MIB module for control plane and monitoring 
   - need for diagnostic tools  
    
   Basically MIB module should be implemented per routing instance. 
    
   Today, diagnostic tools can detect failures of control plane and data 
   plane for general MPLS TE LSPs [LSP-PING]. 
   The diagnostic tools must detect failures of control and data plane 
   for general GMPLS TE LSPs. 
   Especially, in case that an interworking between MPLS and GMPLS 
   protocol is done, a failure between them MUST be detected.      
    
   Furthermore, many service providers have traditionally built their  
   networks, where optical transport and IP/MPLS service networks belong  
   to different operation, management and ownership. The most important 
   thing is that service providers want to operate and manage their 
   networks independently.

   operation, management and ownership. The most important thing is that 
   service providers want to operate and manage their networks 
   independently. In that sense, operators SHOULD limit to access their 
   service nodes. Especially, in case that a border node is deployed, 
   operators SHOULD limit to access a specific instance. Furthermore, 
   operators SHOULD limit to be able to issue some commands.
