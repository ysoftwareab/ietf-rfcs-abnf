Abstract

   This document describes a standard method for digitally signing
   Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) documents
   using a subset of the XML Digital Signature specification.  A digital
   signature enables the user of a signed PIDF-LO document to attribute
   that information to an authorized source within the domain of the
   target entity.  A schema is defined for including a domain
   authorization element in the PIDF-LO and a set of XML Path Language
   (XPath) filters for selecting the correct elements for signing.

Internet-Draft                Domain Auth.                     June 2005


1.  Introduction

   Users of location information may desire to be able to attribute this
   information to an authorized entity.  This entity may not have
   provided the information, but they must be able to vouch for its
   accuracy.  In most cases this will mean that the trusted entity
   resides within the same domain, or access network, as the target
   entity.

   This specification describes a means by which a domain authority may
   assume responsibility for the validity of the location information
   provided in a Presence Information Data Format Location Object
   (PIDF-LO [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pidf-lo]).  A standard form is described
   whereby a domain authority may digitally sign the PIDF-LO document.
   This signature ensures that a user of the PIDF-LO can verify that the
   presentity identified is at the described location within certain
   time bounds.

   Only selected data are signed within a PIDF, allowing a user freedom
   to change other parts of the document without affecting the
   signature.  A signature only applies to a single tuple element,
   allowing separate tuples to be unsigned, or to be signed separately.
   Elements such as notes, contact information and the privacy
   preferences described in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pidf-lo] are not signed to
   allow for modification.  The signed elements are restricted to:

   the presentity identifier: the entity attribute of the _presence_
      element.

   timestamp: the timestamp associated with the location information

   location-info: the actual location information

   expires: the time at which the signature expires, this datum is added
      by this specification


1.1  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The term _presentity_ is used as defined in RFC 2778 [RFC2778].

   The term _location user_ is used to refer to the entity that is
   consuming location information.  In the context of RFC 2778
   [RFC2778], the location user may be a watcher.

2.  The Domain Authorization Element

   This specification describes a new namespace for a domain
   authorization element.  This element contains the digital signature
   described in RFC 3275 [RFC3275] and an expiry time for the signature.

   The "domain-auth" element is added to the "tuple" element that
   contains the "geopriv" element.  Separate "tuple" elements are signed
   separately.  The XML Schema definition for the "domain-auth" element
   is included in Section 4.1.

   The digital signature signs the PIDF-LO document that includes only
   the "tuple" element that the "domain-auth" element is included
   within.  Section 3.1 describes the specific means by which the
   correct elements are selected.

2.1  'expires' attribute

   The "expires" attribute defines the expiry time for the domain
   authorization provided.  A user of the PIDF-LO document MUST consider
   the document to be unsigned beyond the expiry time.

3.  Signature Elements

   The XML Signature specification [RFC3275] describes a means to sign
   XML documents.  The "Signature" element consists of three major
   parts:

   1.  a description of the signed elements, which may be an entire
       document, or selected parts of a document

   2.  a digital signature

   3.  information on the key used to sign the document


3.1  PIDF-LO Document Transform

   Since the content of XML documents is indeterminate based on similar
   data sets, RFC 3275 [RFC3275] describes a set of transforms that may
   be applied to a document before applying a digital signature.

   The input PIDF-LO document MUST be canonicalized using either
   Canonical XML ("http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315") or
   Exclusive Canonical XML
   ("http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xml-exc-c14n-20020718/") [W3C.REC-
   xml-exc-c14n-20020718].  Note that both of these canonicalization
   methods remove comments from the source document.

   The signature form selected for this document is an enveloped
   signature.  Therefore the enveloped signature transform
   ("http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#enveloped-signature") MUST be
   applied to the document.

   A filter is applied to the input document in order to select the
   correct elements for signing.  It is RECOMMENDED that the transformed
   document is also a valid PIDF-LO.  In addition, the transform should
   exclude "tuple" elements other than the element that is directly
   signed.  This ensures that other content may be included in other
   "tuple" elements, including other digital signatures.

   The following elements MUST be selected:

   o  the "presence" element, which includes the "entity" attribute

   o  the "location-info" element and all of its contents

   o  the "timestamp" element associated with the signed "tuple" element

Internet-Draft                Domain Auth.                     June 2005


   o  the "domain-auth" element

   The minimum set of elements required to ensure that the signed
   document is a valid PIDF-LO SHOULD also be included.

   The XML Path Language (XPath) filter defined in Section 4.2 meets the
   above criteria.  For convenience, and to reduce the size of a signed
   PIDF-LO document, this transform may be identified by the URN
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:domain-auth#PIDF-LO".

   Note that any elements from other namespaces included within the
   "domain-auth" element are selected by this XPath filter.  This
   ensures that additions to this element are covered by the digital
   signature.

3.2  Algorithms

   As recommended in RFC 3275 [RFC3275], implementations of this
   specification MUST provide the following algorithms:

   digest algorithm: The SHA1 digest, as identified by the URN
      "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#sha1".

   signature algorithm: DSA with SHA1, as identified by the URN
      "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#dsa-sha1".

   canonicalization method: Canonical XML [RFC3076], as identified by
      the URN "http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315".

   transforms: The enveloped signature transform, as identified by the
      URN "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#enveloped-signature"; and
      the transform defined in Section 4.2, as identified by the URN
      "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:domain-auth#PIDF-LO".

   It is also RECOMMENDED that the following are also supported:

   signature algorithm: PKCS1 (RSA-SHA1) signature algorithm, as
      idenfied by "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1".

   canonicalization method: Exclusive Canonical XML, as identified by
      the URN "http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xml-exc-c14n-20020718/"
      [W3C.REC-xml-exc-c14n-20020718].


3.3  Signature Key Data

   RFC 3275 [RFC3275] describes a number of methods for describing the
   key used to sign the document.  For this specification, the "KeyInfo"



Thomson & Winterbottom    Expires December 30, 2005             [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                Domain Auth.                     June 2005


   element MUST be provided in the "Signature" element.

   The domain authority MUST also describe a means to retrieve an X.509
   certificate that includes the key used to sign the document.  This
   can be either by including an "X509Certificate" element, or by
   referencing another certificate.

   A reference to a certificate within the same document may be made
   using the "X509SubjectName" element or a fragment identifier URI.  A
   fragment identifier URI might be applicable where multiple signatures
   are applied to different parts of the document.  External certificate
   sources SHOULD be described by URI only in the "RetrievalMethod"
   element.  It is RECOMMENDED that the scheme for the RetrievalMethod
   URI indicates a secure protocol, such as HTTPS.

   The domain authority MAY include additional information in the
   "KeyInfo" element that could assist the location user in validating
   the certificate.  For example a certificate chain and certificate
   revocation list may be added.  However, this specification does not
   specify how the location user validates the certificate.

   Note that the digest and signatures are only included to serve as an
   example.  Several elements are included in the above example that
   should not be signed by the domain authority, as described in
   Section 3.1, in particular "usage-rules" and "note-well".

   The transform described in Section 3.1 removes extraneous elements,
   resulting in the following PIDF-LO, which only includes the signed
   elements (in this example whitespace has been added for readability):

6.  Security Considerations

   The security limitations of this specification are no more
   significant than those already identified in RFC 3275 [RFC3275].  In
   particular the rules *Only What is Signed is Secure*, *Only What is
   "Seen" Should be Signed*, and *"See" What is Signed* SHOULD be
   applied.

   It is RECOMMENDED that where certitude of information is important
   that only the signed information is transmitted or stored, that is,
   the PIDF-LO document formed by performing the transform described in
   Section 3.1.  This ensures that no additional information may be
   misconstrued as being verifiable.  This is particular applicable if
   the contents of the PIDF-LO document are displayed on screen.

   A degree of trust must exist between the domain authority and the
   location user.  It is the responsibility of the location user to
   verify the identity of the domain authority and assert the
   appropriate level of trust.  If the location user is unable to
   validate the identity of the domain authority for any reason, then
   the PIDF-LO document MUST be considered unsigned.
