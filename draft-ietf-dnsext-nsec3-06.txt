Abstract

   The DNS Security Extensions introduces the NSEC3 resource record for
   authenticated denial of existence.  This document introduces a new
   resource record as an alternative to NSEC that provides measures
   against zone enumeration and allows for gradual expansion of
   delegation-centric zones.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Rationale

   The DNS Security Extensions included the NSEC RR to provide
   authenticated denial of existence.  Though the NSEC RR meets the
   requirements for authenticated denial of existence, it introduces a
   side-effect in that the contents of a zone can be enumerated.  This
   property introduces undesired policy issues.

   An enumerated zone can be used either directly as a source of
   probable e-mail addresses for spam, or indirectly as a key for
   multiple WHOIS queries to reveal registrant data which many
   registries may be under strict legal obligations to protect.  Many
   registries therefore prohibit copying of their zone file; however the
   use of NSEC RRs renders these policies unenforceable.

   A second problem is that the cost to cryptographically secure
   delegations to unsigned zones is high for large delegation-centric
   zones and zones where insecure delegations will be updated rapidly.
   For these zones, the costs of maintaining the NSEC record chain may
   be extremely high relative to the gain of cryptographically
   authenticating existence of unsecured zones.

   This document presents the NSEC3 Resource Record which can be used as
   an alternative to NSEC to mitigate these issues.

1.2.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

1.3.  Terminology

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the basic DNS and DNSSEC
   concepts described in RFC 1034 [2], RFC 1035 [3], RFC 4033 [4], RFC
   4034 [5], RFC 4035 [6] and subsequent RFCs that update them: RFC 2136
   [7], RFC2181 [8] and RFC2308 [9].

   The following terminology is used throughout this document:

   Zone enumeration: is used to describe the practice of discovering the
      contents of a zone via successive queries.  Zone enumeration was
      not practical prior to the introduction of DNSSEC.

   Original ownername: refers to the ownername corresponding to a hashed
      ownername.
   Hashed ownername: refers to the ownername created after applying the
      hash function to an ownername.
   Hash order: is the order in which hashed ownernames are arranged
      according to their numerical value, treating the leftmost (lowest
      numbered) octet as the most significant octet.  Note that this
      order is the same as the canonical DNS name order specified in RFC
      4034 [5] when the hashed ownernames are encoded using base32 with
      the chosen alphabet.
   Empty non-terminal: refers to a domain name that owns no resource
      records, but has subdomains that do.
   Delegation: refers to a NS RRset with a name different from the
      current zone apex (non-zone-apex), signifying a delegation to a
      subzone.
   Secure delegation: refers to a name containing a delegation (NS
      RRset), and a signed DS RRset, signifying a delegation to a signed
      subzone.
   Insecure delegation: refers to a name containing a delegation (NS
      RRset), but lacking a DS RRset, signifying a delegation to an
      unsigned subzone.
   Opt-Out NSEC3 Record: refers to an NSEC3 resource record which has
      the Opt-Out flag field set to 1.
   Opt-Out Zone: refers to a zone with at least one Opt-Out NSEC3
      record.
   Closest encloser: refers to longest existing ancestor of a name.  See
      also section 3.3.1 [14].
   Closest Provable Encloser: refers to the longest ancestor of a name
      that can be proven to exist.  Note that this is only different
      from the closest encloser in an Opt-Out zone.
   Next Closer Name: refers to the name one label longer than a name's
      Closest Provable Encloser.
   Base32 encoding: refers to the "Base 32 Encoding with Extended Hex
      Alphabet" as specified in RFC 3548bis [15].  In this
      specification, the trailing padding characters ("=") are not used.
   Cover: An NSEC3 record is said to "cover" a name if the hash of the
      name, or Next Closer Name, falls between the NSEC3's ownername and
      the next hashed ownername.  In other words, if it proves the
      nonexistence of the name, either directly or by proving the
      nonexistence of an ancestor of the name.
   Matches: An NSEC3 record is said to "match" a name if the NSEC3
      ownername is the same as the name's hashed ownername.


2.  Backwards Compatibility

   This specification describes a protocol change that is not generally
   backwards compatible with standard DNSSEC.  In particular, security-

   aware resolvers that are unaware of this specification (NSEC3-unaware
   resolvers) may fail to validate the changed responses dictated by
   this document.

   In order to aid deployment, this specification uses a signalling
   technique to prevent NSEC3-unaware resolvers from attempting to
   validate responses from NSEC3-signed zones.

   This specification allocates two new DNSKEY algorithm identifiers for
   this purpose.  Algorithm XX [temporarily, 131] is an alias for the
   existing algorithm 3, DSA.  Algorithm YY [temporarily, 133] is an
   alias for the existing algorithm 5, RSASHA1.  These are not new
   algorithms, they are simply additional identifiers for the existing
   algorithms.

   Zones signed according to this specification SHOULD only use these
   algorithm identifiers for their secure entry point DNSKEY RRs (i.e.,
   DNSKEYs used as trust anchors, or represented as DS records in the
   parent zone.)  Because these new identifiers will be unknown
   algorithms to existing, NSEC3-unaware resolvers, those resolvers will
   then treat responses from the NSEC3 signed zone as insecure, as
   detailed in [6], section 5.2.

   Security aware resolvers that are aware of this specification MUST
   recognize the new algorithm identifiers and treat them as equivalent
   to the algorithms that they alias.

   A methodology for transitioning from a DNSSEC standard signed zone to
   a zone signed using NSEC3 is discussed in Section 9.3.


3.  The NSEC3 Resource Record

   The NSEC3 Resource Record (RR) provides authenticated denial of
   existence for DNS Resource Record Sets.

   The NSEC3 RR lists RR types present at the NSEC3 RR's original
   ownername.  It includes the next hashed ownername in the hash order
   of the zone.  The complete set of NSEC3 RRs in a zone indicates which
   RRsets exist for the original ownername of the RRset and form a chain
   of hashed ownernames in the zone.  This information is used to
   provide authenticated denial of existence for DNS data.  To provide
   protection against zone enumeration, the ownernames used in the NSEC3
   RR are cryptographic hashes of the original ownername prepended to
   the name of the zone.  The NSEC3 RR indicates which hash function is
   used to construct the hash, which salt is used, and how many
   iterations of the hash function are performed over the original
   ownername.  The hashing technique is described fully in Section 4.

Internet-Draft                    nsec3                        June 2006


   Hashed ownernames of unsigned delegations may be excluded from the
   chain.  An NSEC3 record whose span covers the hash of an unsigned
   delegation's Next Closer Name is referred to as an Opt-Out NSEC3
   record and is indicated by the presence of a flag.

   The ownername for the NSEC3 RR is the base32 encoding of the hashed
   ownername prepended to the name of the zone.

   The type value for the NSEC3 RR is XX.

   The NSEC3 RR RDATA format is class independent and is described
   below.

   The class MUST be the same as the original ownername's class.

   The NSEC3 RR SHOULD have the same TTL value as the SOA minimum TTL
   field.  This is in the spirit of negative caching [9].

3.1.  RDATA fields

3.1.1.  Hash Algorithm

   The Hash Algorithm field identifies the cryptographic hash algorithm
   used to construct the hash-value.

   The values are as defined for the DS record (see RFC 3658 [10]).

3.1.2.  Opt-Out Flag

   The Opt-Out Flag field indicates whether this NSEC3 RR may cover
   unsigned delegations.  See Section 5 for details about the use of
   this flag.

3.1.3.  Iterations

   The Iterations field defines the number of additional times the hash
   has been performed.  More iterations results in greater resiliency of
   the hash value against dictionary attacks, but at a higher cost for
   both the server and resolver.  See Section 4 for details of this
   field's use.

3.1.4.  Salt Length

   The salt length field defines the length of the salt in octets,
   ranging in value from 0 to 255 octets.

Internet-Draft                    nsec3                        June 2006


3.1.5.  Salt

   The Salt field is appended to the original ownername before hashing
   in order to defend against pre-calculated dictionary attacks.  See
   Section 4 for details on how the salt is used.

3.1.6.  Hash Length

   The Hash Length field defines the length of the next hashed
   ownername, ranging in value from 0 to 255 octets.

3.1.7.  Next Hashed Ownername

   The Next Hashed Ownername field contains the next hashed ownername in
   hash order, encoded as an unmodified binary value.  Given the ordered
   set of all hashed ownernames, the Next Hashed Ownername contains the
   hash of an ownername that immediately follows the ownername of the
   given NSEC3 record.  The value of the Next Hashed Ownername Field in
   the last NSEC3 record in the zone is the same as the ownername of the
   first NSEC3 RR in the zone in hash order.  Note that, unlike the
   NSEC3 ownername, this field does not contain the appended zone name.

3.1.8.  Type Bit Maps

   The Type Bit Maps field identifies the RRset types which exist at the
   NSEC3 RR's original ownername.

3.2.  NSEC3 RDATA Wire Format

   The RDATA of the NSEC3 RR is as shown below:

                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

   significant bit first.

   Salt Length represents the length of the Salt field in octets.  If
   the value is zero, the following salt field is omitted.

   Salt, if present, is encoded as a sequence of binary octets.  The
   length of this field is determined by the preceding Salt Length
   field.

   Hash Length represents the length of the Next Hashed Ownername field
   in octets.

   Next Hashed Ownername is not encoded, unlike the NSEC3 RR's
   ownername.  It is the unmodified binary hash value.  It does not
   include the name of the containing zone.  The length of this field is
   determined by the preceding Hash Length field.

3.2.1.  Type Bit Map Encoding

   The encoding of the Type Bit Map is the same as used by the NSEC
   record, described in RFC 4034 [5].

   The RR type space is split into 256 window blocks, each representing
   the low-order 8 bits of the 16-bit RR type space.  Each block that
   has at least one active RR type is encoded using a single octet
   window number (from 0 to 255), a single octet bitmap length (from 1
   to 32) indicating the number of octets used for the window block's
   bitmap, and up to 32 octets (256 bits) of bitmap.

   Blocks are present in the NSEC3 RR RDATA in increasing numerical
   order.

   "|" denotes concatenation

   Type Bit Map(s) Field = ( Window Block # | Bitmap Length | Bitmap ) +

   Each bitmap encodes the low-order 8 bits of RR types within the
   window block, in network bit order.  The first bit is bit 0.  For
   window block 0, bit 1 corresponds to RR type 1 (A), bit 2 corresponds
   to RR type 2 (NS), and so forth.  For window block 1, bit 1
   corresponds to RR type 257, bit 2 to RR type 258.  If a bit is set to
   1, it indicates that an RRset of that type is present for the NSEC3
   RR's ownername.  If a bit is set to 0, it indicates that no RRset of
   that type is present for the NSEC3 RR's ownername.

   Since bit 0 in window block 0 refers to the non-existing RR type 0,
   it MUST be set to 0.  After verification, the validator MUST ignore
   the value of bit 0 in window block 0.

   Bits representing Meta-TYPEs or QTYPEs as specified in RFC 2929 [11]
   (section 3.1) or within the range reserved for assignment only to
   QTYPEs and Meta-TYPEs MUST be set to 0, since they do not appear in
   zone data.  If encountered, they must be ignored upon reading.

   Blocks with no types present MUST NOT be included.  Trailing zero
   octets in the bitmap MUST be omitted.  The length of each block's
   bitmap is determined by the type code with the largest numerical
   value, within that block, among the set of RR types present at the
   NSEC3 RR's actual ownername.  Trailing zero octets not specified MUST
   be interpreted as zero octets.

3.3.  Presentation Format

   The presentation format of the RDATA portion is as follows:

   o  The Opt-Out Flag Field is represented as an unsigned decimal
      integer.  The value is either 0 or 1.
   o  The Hash Algorithm field is presented as an unsigned decimal
      integer.  The value has a maximum of 255.
   o  The Iterations field is presented as an unsigned decimal integer.
      The value is between 0 and 8388607, inclusive.
   o  The Salt Length field is not presented.
   o  The Salt field is represented as a sequence of case-insensitive
      hexadecimal digits.  Whitespace is not allowed within the
      sequence.  The Salt Field is represented as "-" (without the
      quotes) when the Salt Length field has value 0.
   o  The Hash Length field is not presented.
   o  The Next Hashed Ownername field is represented as an unpadded
      sequence of case-insensitive base32 digits, without whitespace.
   o  The Type Bit Maps Field is represented as a sequence of RR type
      mnemonics.  When the mnemonic is not known, the TYPE
      representation as described in RFC 3597 [12] (section 5) MUST be
      used.


4.  Calculation of the Hash

   The hash calculation uses three of the NSEC3 RDATA fields: Hash
   Algorithm, Salt, and Iterations.

   Define H(x) to be the hash of x using the Hash Algorithm selected by
   the NSEC3 record, k to be the number of Iterations, and || to
   indicate concatenation.  Then define:

      IH(salt, x, 0) = H(x || salt), and





Laurie, et al.          Expires December 27, 2006              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                    nsec3                        June 2006


      IH(salt, x, k) = H(IH(salt, x, k-1) || salt), if k > 0

   Then the calculated hash of an ownername is

      IH(salt, ownername, iterations),

   where the ownername is in the canonical form.

   The canonical form of the ownername is the wire format of the
   ownername where:

   1.  The ownername is fully expanded (no DNS name compression) and
       fully qualified;
   2.  All uppercase US-ASCII letters are replaced by the corresponding
       lowercase US-ASCII letters;
   3.  If the ownername is a wildcard name, the ownername is in its
       original unexpanded form, including the "*" label (no wildcard
       substitution);

   This form is as defined in section 6.2 of RFC 4034 ([5]).


5.  Opt-Out

   In this specification, as in standard DNSSEC, NS RRsets at delegation
   points are not signed and may be accompanied by a DS RRset.  With the
   Opt-Out bit clear, the security status of the child zone is
   determined by the presence or absence of this DS RRset,
   cryptographically proven by the signed NSEC3 RR at the delegation's
   hashed ownername.  The presence of the Opt-Out flag modifies this by
   allowing insecure delegations to exist within the signed zone without
   a corresponding NSEC3 record at the delegation's hashed ownername.
   These delegations are proven insecure with a covering Opt-Out NSEC3
   record.

   An Opt-Out NSEC3 record is said to cover a delegation if the hash of
   the delegation's Next Closer Name to its closest provable encloser is
   between the NSEC3 ownername and next hashed ownername.

   An Opt-Out NSEC3 record does not assert the existence or non-
   existence of the insecure delegations that it may cover.  This allows
   for the addition or removal of these delegations without
   recalculating or resigning records in the NSEC3 chain.  However, Opt-
   Out NSEC3 records do assert the (non)existence of other,
   authoritative RRsets.

   An Opt-Out NSEC3 record MAY have the same original owner name as an
   insecure delegation.  In this case, the delegation is proven insecure

Internet-Draft                    nsec3                        June 2006


   by the lack of a DS bit in type map and the signed NSEC3 record does
   assert the existence of the delegation.

   Zones using Opt-Out MAY contain a mixture of Opt-Out NSEC3 records
   and non-Opt-Out NSEC3 records.  If an NSEC3 record is not Opt-Out,
   there MUST NOT be any hashed ownernames of insecure delegations (nor
   any other records) between it and the RRsets indicated by the Next
   Hashed Ownername in the NSEC3 RDATA.  If it is Opt-Out, it MUST only
   cover hashed ownernames (or hashed Next Closer Names) of insecure
   delegations.

   The effects of the Opt-Out flag on signing, serving, and validating
   responses are covered in following sections.


6.  Authoritative Server Considerations

6.1.  Zone Signing

   Zones using NSEC3 must satisfy the following properties:

   o  Each ownername within the zone that owns authoritative RRsets MUST
      have a corresponding NSEC3 RR.  Ownernames that correspond to
      unsigned delegations MAY have a corresponding NSEC3 RR.  However,
      if there is not, there MUST be an Opt-Out NSEC3 RR that covers the
      Next Closer Name to the delegation.  Other non-authoritative RRs
      are not represented in the set of NSEC3 RRs.
   o  Each empty non-terminal MUST have an NSEC3 record, unless the
      empty non-terminal is only derived from an insecure delegation
      covered by an Opt-Out NSEC3 RR.
   o  The TTL value for any NSEC3 RR SHOULD be the same as the minimum
      TTL value field in the zone SOA RR.
   o  The Type Bit Maps field of every NSEC3 resource record in a signed
      zone MUST indicate the presence of all types present at the
      original ownername.  Note that this means that the NSEC3 type
      itself will only be present in the Type Bit Maps if the original
      ownername happened to also be a hashed ownername of another name
      in the zone.

   The following steps describe a method of proper construction of NSEC3
   records.  This is not the only such possible method.

   1.  For each unique original ownername in the zone add an NSEC3
       RRset.
       *  If Opt-Out is being used, ownernames of unsigned delegations
          MAY be excluded.





Laurie, et al.          Expires December 27, 2006              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                    nsec3                        June 2006


       *  The ownername of the NSEC3 RR is the hashed equivalent of the
          original owner name, prepended to the zone name.
       *  The Next Hashed Ownername field is left blank for the moment.
       *  If Opt-Out is being used, set the Opt-Out bit to one.
       *  For collision detection purposes, optionally keep track of the
          original ownername with the NSEC3 record.
       *  Additionally, for collision detection purposes, optionally
          create an additional NSEC3 corresponding to the original
          ownername with the asterisk label prepended (i.e., as if a
          wildcard existed as a child of this ownername) and keep track
          of this original ownername.  Mark this NSEC3 record as
          temporary.
   2.  For each RRset at the original owner name, set the corresponding
       bit in the Type Bit Maps field.
   3.  If the difference in number of labels between the apex and the
       original ownername is greater than 1, additional NSEC3s need to
       be added for every empty non-terminal between the apex and the
       original ownername.  This process may generate NSEC3 RRs with
       duplicate hashed ownernames.  Optionally, for collision
       detection, track the original ownernames of these NSEC3s, and,
       optionally create temporary NSEC3s for wildcard collisions in a
       similar fashion to step 1.
   4.  Sort the set of NSEC3 RRs into hash order.
   5.  Combine NSEC3 RRs with identical hashed ownernames by replacing
       with a single NSEC3 RR with the Type Bit Maps field consisting of
       the union of the types represented by the set of NSEC3 RRs.  If
       the original ownername was tracked, then collisions may be
       detected when combining as all of the matching NSEC3 RRs should
       have the same original ownername.  Discard any possible temporary
       NSEC3s.
   6.  In each NSEC3 RR, insert the Next Hashed Ownername by using the
       value of the next NSEC3 RR in hash order.  The Next Hashed
       Ownername of the last NSEC3 in the zone contains the value of the
       hashed ownername of the first NSEC3 in the hash order.

   If a hash collision is detected, then a new salt MUST be chosen and
   the signing process restarted.

6.2.  Zone Serving

   This specification modifies DNSSEC-enabled DNS responses generated by
   authoritative servers.  In particular, it replaces the use of NSEC
   records in such responses with NSEC3 records.

   In the following response cases, the NSEC records dictated by the
   DNSSEC standard [6] are replaced with NSEC3 records that prove the
   same facts.  Responses that would not contain NSEC records using
   standard DNSSEC are unchanged by this specification.



Laurie, et al.          Expires December 27, 2006              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                    nsec3                        June 2006


   When returning responses containing multiple NSEC3 RRs, all of the
   NSEC3 RRs MUST use the same hash algorithm, iteration, and salt
   values.

6.2.1.  Closest Encloser Proof

   For many NSEC3 responses a proof of the closest encloser is required.
   This is a proof that some ancestor of the QNAME is the closest
   encloser of QNAME.

   This proof consists of (up to) two different NSEC3 RRsets:

   o  An NSEC3 RRset that matches the closest (provable) encloser is
      included.
   o  An NSEC3 RRset that covers the Next Closer Name to the closest
      encloser is included.

   The first NSEC3 essentially proposes a possible closest encloser, and
   proves that the particular encloser does, in fact, exist.  The second
   NSEC3 proves that the possible closest encloser is the closest, and
   proves that QNAME (and any ancestors between QNAME and the closest
   encloser) do not exist.

   These NSEC3 RRsets are collectively referred to as the "closest
   encloser proof" in the subsequent descriptions.

   For example, the closest encloser proof for the nonexistent
   "alpha.beta.gamma.example." ownername might prove that
   "gamma.example." is the closest encloser.  This response would
   contain the NSEC3 record that matches the hashed ownername of
   "gamma.example.", and would also contain the NSEC3 record that covers
   the hashed ownername of "beta.gamma.example." (which is the Next
   Closer Name.)

   It is possible, when using Opt-Out (Section 5), to not be able to
   prove the actual closest encloser because it is only part of the
   names of insecure delegations covered by Opt-Out spans.  In this
   case, instead of proving the actual closest encloser, the "Closest
   Provable Encloser" is used.  That is, the closest enclosing
   authoritative name is used instead.  In this case, the set of NSEC3
   RRsets used for this proof is referred to as the "closest provable
   encloser proof."

6.2.2.  Name Error Responses

   To prove the nonexistence of QNAME a closest encloser proof and an
   NSEC3 RRset covering the wildcard record at the closest encloser MUST
   be included in the response.  This collection of (up to) three NSEC3



Laurie, et al.          Expires December 27, 2006              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                    nsec3                        June 2006


   RRsets proves both that QNAME does not exist and that a wildcard that
   could have matched QNAME also does not exist.

   For example, if "gamma.example." is the proven closest encloser to
   QNAME, then an NSEC3 RRset covering the hashed ownername of
   "*.gamma.example." is included in the authority section of the
   response.

6.2.3.  No Data Responses, QTYPE is not DS

   The server MUST include the NSEC3 record that matches QNAME.  This
   NSEC3 record MUST NOT have the bit corresponding to QTYPE set in its
   Type Bit Maps field.

6.2.4.  No Data Responses, QTYPE is DS

   If there is an NSEC3 record that matches QNAME, the server MUST
   return it in the response.  The DS bit in the type map MUST NOT be
   set in this NSEC3 record.

   If no NSEC3 record matches QNAME, the server MUST return a closest
   provable encloser proof for QNAME.  The NSEC3 record that covers the
   Next Closer Name MUST have the Opt-Out bit set (note that this is
   true by definition - if the Opt-Out bit is not set, something has
   gone wrong).

   If a server is authoritative for both sides of a zone cut at QNAME,
   the server MUST return the proof from the parent side of the zone
   cut.

6.2.5.  Wildcard No Data Responses

   If there is a wildcard match for QNAME, but QTYPE is not present at
   that name, the response MUST include a closest encloser proof for
   QNAME and MUST include the NSEC3 RRset that matches the wildcard.
   This combination proves both that QNAME itself does not exist and
   that a wildcard that matches QNAME does exist.  Note that the closest
   encloser to QNAME MUST be the immediate ancestor of the wildcard
   record (if this is not the case, then something has gone wrong).

6.2.6.  Wildcard Answer Responses

   If there is a wildcard match for QNAME and QTYPE, then, in addition
   to the expanded wildcard RRset returned in the answer section of the
   response, proof that the wildcard match was valid must be returned.

   This proof is accomplished by proving that both QNAME does not exist,
   and that the QNAME's closest encloser and wildcard's immediate



Laurie, et al.          Expires December 27, 2006              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                    nsec3                        June 2006


   ancestor are the same (i.e., the correct wildcard matched).

   To this end, the NSEC3 that covers the Next Closer Name to the
   immediate ancestor of the wildcard MUST be returned.  It is not
   necessary to return an NSEC3 that matches the closest encloser, as
   the existence of this closest encloser is proven by the presence of
   the expanded wildcard in the response.

6.2.7.  Referrals to Unsigned Subzones

   If there is an NSEC3 that matches the delegation name, then that
   NSEC3 RRset MUST be included in the response.  The DS bit in this
   NSEC3's type map MUST NOT be set.

   If the zone in Opt-Out, then there may not be a record corresponding
   to the delegation.  In this case, the closest provable encloser proof
   MUST be included in the response.  The included NSEC3 RR that covers
   the Next Closer Name for the delegation MUST have the Opt-Out flag
   set to 1 (note that this will be the case unless something has gone
   wrong).

6.2.8.  Responding to NSEC3 Queries

   [Note: consensus may be that queries for NSEC3 records or queries
   with QTYPE=NSEC3 always return Name Error responses -- that is, NSEC3
   records are treated as not existing from a query perspective.  This
   is the strategy proposed by the original NSEC3 draft version.  Its
   primary downside is that direct queries for NSEC3 records will not
   function.]

   Since NSEC3 ownernames are not represented in the NSEC3 chain like
   other zone ownernames, direct queries for NSEC3 ownernames present
   two special cases.  All other cases MUST be handled normally.

6.2.8.1.  QTYPE is not NSEC3, NSEC3 RRset only

   This special case arises when the following are all true:

   o  The QNAME equals an existing NSEC3 ownername, and
   o  There are no other record types that exist at QNAME, and
   o  The QTYPE does not equal NSEC3.

   These conditions describe a particular case: the answer should be a
   NOERROR/NODATA response, but there is no NSEC3 RRset for H(QNAME) to
   include in the authority section.

   In this case the server MUST return NAME ERROR as if the NSEC3 record
   did not exist, together with a proof as for a normal NAME ERROR



Laurie, et al.          Expires December 27, 2006              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                    nsec3                        June 2006


   response.

6.2.8.2.  QTYPE is NSEC3, QNAME does not match

   This special case arises when the following are all true:

   o  The QNAME does not equal an existing NSEC3 ownername, nor any
      other name, and
   o  The QTYPE equals NSEC3.

   Because it is possible to "prove" the nonexistence of almost all
   NSEC3 records (the exceptions are those that have other record types
   at the name), it is necessary to vary the standard response when the
   QTYPE is NSEC3.  In this case the server MUST respond with the NSEC3
   record that covers the unhashed QNAME.

   Since the QNAME is not hashed, it is only possible to prove the
   nonexistence of NSEC3 records that actually don't exist.  If they do
   exist, then they will appear as the ownername of an NSEC3 record, and
   so it will be impossible to show the NSEC3 record that covers the
   unhashed name.

6.2.9.  Server Response to a Run-time Collision

   If the hash of a non-existing QNAME collides with an existing NSEC3
   ownername, then the server will be unable to return a response that
   proves that QNAME does not exist.  In this case, the server MUST
   return a response with an RCODE of 2 (server failure).

   Note that with the hash algorithm specified in this document, SHA-1,
   such collisions are astronomically unlikely.

6.3.  Secondary Servers

   Secondary servers (and perhaps other entities) need to reliably
   determine which NSEC3 parameters (that is, hash, salt and iterations)
   are present at every hashed ownername, in order to be able to choose
   an appropriate set of NSEC3 records for negative responses.  This is
   indicated by the parameters at the apex: any set of parameters that
   is used in an NSEC3 record whose original ownername is the apex of
   the zone MUST be present throughout the zone.

   A method to determine which NSEC3 in a complete chain corresponds to
   the apex is to look for a NSEC3 RRset which has the SOA bit set in
   the RDATA bit type maps field.

6.4.  Zones Using Unknown Hash Algorithms

   Zones that are signed according to this specification, but using an
   unrecognized NSEC3 Hash Algorithm value, cannot be effectively
   served.  Such zones SHOULD be rejected when loading.  Servers SHOULD
   [MUST?] respond with RCODE=2 (server failure) responses when handling
   queries that would fall under such zones.

6.5.  Dynamic Update

   A zone signed using NSEC3 may accept dynamic updates.  However, NSEC3
   introduces some special considerations for dynamic updates.

   Adding and removing names in a zone MUST account for the creation or
   removal of empty non-terminals.

   o  When removing a name with a corresponding NSEC3, checks must be
      made to remove any NSEC3s corresponding with possible empty non-
      terminals created by the name.  Note that more than one name may
      be asserting the existence of a particular empty non-terminal.
   o  When adding a name that requires adding an NSEC3 RR, NSEC3s MUST
      also be added for any empty non-terminals might also be adding.
      That is, if there isn't an existing NSEC3 matching a potential
      empty non-terminal, it must be created and added.

   The presence of Opt-Out in a zone means that some additions or
   delegations of names will not require changes to the NSEC3 records in
   a zone.

   o  When removing a delegation RRset, if that delegation does not have
      a matching NSEC3 RR, then it was opted out.  In this case, nothing
      further needs to be done.
   o  When adding a delegation RRset, if the delegation's Next Closer
      Name is covered by an existing Opt-Out NSEC3 RR, then the
      delegation MAY be added without modifying the NSEC3 RRs in the
      zone.

   The presence of Opt-Out in a zone means that when adding or removing
   NSEC3 records, the value of the Opt-Out flag that should be set in
   new or modified NSEC3 records is ambiguous.  Servers SHOULD follow
   this set of basic rules to resolve the ambiguity.

   The central concept to these rules is that the state of the Opt-Out
   flag of the covering NSEC3 is preserved.

   o  When removing an NSEC3 RR, the value of the Opt-Out flag for the
      previous NSEC3 (the one whose Next Hashed Ownername is modified)
      should not be changed.



Laurie, et al.          Expires December 27, 2006              [Page 18]

Internet-Draft                    nsec3                        June 2006


   o  When adding an NSEC3 RR, the value of the Opt-Out flag is set the
      value of the NSEC3 that previously covered the new NSEC3 RR's
      ownername.  That is, the now previous NSEC3 RR.

   If the zone in question is consistent with its use of the Opt-Out
   flag (that is, all NSEC3 RRs in the zone have the same value for the
   flag) then these rules will retain that consistency.  If the zone is
   not consistent in the use of the flag (i.e., a partially Opt-Out
   zone), then these rules will not retain the same pattern of use of
   the Opt-Out flag.

   For zones that partially use the Opt-Out flag, if there is a logical
   pattern for that use, the pattern could be maintained by using a
   local policy on the server.


7.  Validator Considerations

7.1.  Responses with Unknown Hash Types

   A validator MUST ignore NSEC3 records with unknown hash types.  If no
   known hash types are present, the validator SHOULD [MUST?] treat the
   response as insecure.  The consequences of this policy are discussed
   in Section 11.1.3.

7.2.  Verifying NSEC3 RRsets

   A validator MAY treat a response as bogus if the response contains
   NSEC3 RRs that contain different values for hash algorithm,
   iterations, or salt from each other.

7.3.  Closest Encloser Proof

   In order to verify a closest encloser proof, the validator MUST find
   the longest name, X, such that

   o  X is an ancestor of QNAME that matches an NSEC3 RR present in the
      response.  This is a candidate for the closest encloser.
   o  The name one label longer than X (but still an ancestor of--or
      equal to--QNAME) is covered by an NSEC3 RR present in the
      response.

   One possible algorithm for verifying this proof is as follows:

   1.  Set SNAME=QNAME.
   2.  Check whether SNAME exists:





Laurie, et al.          Expires December 27, 2006              [Page 19]

Internet-Draft                    nsec3                        June 2006


       *  If there is no NSEC3 RR in the response that matches SNAME
          (i.e., an NSEC3 whose ownername is the same as the hash of
          SNAME, prepended to the zone name), clear the flag.
       *  If there is an NSEC3 RR in the response that covers SNAME, set
          the flag.
       *  If there is a matching NSEC3 RR in the response and the flag
          was set, then the proof is complete, and SNAME is the closest
          encloser.
       *  If there is a matching NSEC3 RR in the response, but the flag
          is not set, then the response is bogus.
   3.  Truncate SNAME by one label, go to step 2.

   Once the closest encloser has been discovered, the validator MUST
   check that the NSEC3 that has the closest encloser as an ownername is
   from the proper zone.  Neither the NS nor the DNAME type bit may be
   set: this would be an indication that an attacker is using them to
   falsely deny the existence of records for which the server is not
   authoritative.

   In the following descriptions, the phrase "a closest (provable)
   encloser proof for X" means that the algorithm above (or an
   equivalent algorithm) proves that X does not exist by proving that an
   ancestor of X is its closest encloser.

7.4.  Validating Name Error Responses

   A validator MUST verify that there is a closest encloser proof for
   QNAME present in the response and that there is an NSEC3 that covers
   the wildcard at the closest encloser (i.e., the name formed by
   prepending the asterisk label to the closest encloser.)

7.5.  Validating No Data Responses, QTYPE is not DS

   The validator MUST verify that an NSEC3 RR that matches QNAME is
   present and that the QTYPE is not set in its Type Bit Maps field.

   Note that this test also covers the case where the NSEC3 record
   exists because it corresponds to an empty non-terminal, in which case
   the NSEC3 will usually have an empty Type Bit Maps field.

7.6.  Validating No Data Responses, QTYPE is DS

   If there is an NSEC3 RR that matches QNAME present in the response,
   then that NSEC3 MUST not have the bit corresponding to DS set in its
   Type Bit Maps field.

   If there is no such NSEC3 RR, then the validator MUST verify that a
   closest provable encloser proof for QNAME is present in the response,



Laurie, et al.          Expires December 27, 2006              [Page 20]

Internet-Draft                    nsec3                        June 2006


   and that the NSEC3 that covers the Next Closer Name has the Opt-Out
   bit set.

7.7.  Validating Wildcard No Data Responses

   The validator MUST verify a closest encloser proof for QNAME and MUST
   find an NSEC3 RR present in the response that matches the wildcard
   name generated by prepending the asterisk label to the closest
   encloser.  Furthermore, the bit corresponding to QTYPE MUST NOT be
   set in the wildcard matching NSEC3 RR (this is true by definition.)

7.8.  Validating Wildcard Answer Responses

   The verified wildcard answer RRset in the response provides the
   validator with a (candidate) closest encloser for QNAME.  This
   closest encloser is the immediate ancestor to the generating
   wildcard.

   Validators MUST verify that there is an NSEC3 that covers the Next
   Closer Name to QNAME present in the response.  This proves that QNAME
   itself did not exist and that the correct wildcard was used to
   generate the response.

7.9.  Validating Referrals to Unsigned Subzones

   The delegation name in a referral is the name of the NS RRset present
   in the authority section of the referral response.

   If there is an NSEC3 RR present in the response that matches the
   delegation name, then the validator MUST ensure that the NS bit is
   set and that the DS bit is not set in the NSEC3 RR's Type Bit Maps
   field.  The validator MUST also ensure that the NSEC3 record is from
   the correct (i.e., parent) zone.  This is done by ensuring that the
   SOA bit is not set in this NSEC3 RR's Type Bit Maps field.

   Note that the presence of an NS bit implies the absence of a DNAME
   bit, so there is no need to check for the DNAME bit in the NSEC3 RR's
   Type Bit Maps field.

   If there is no NSEC3 RR present that matches the delegation name,
   then the validator MUST verify a closest provable encloser proof for
   the delegation name.  The validator MUST verify that the Opt-Out bit
   is set in the NSEC3 RR that covers the Next Closer Name to the
   delegation name.

7.10.  Validating responses to NSEC3 queries

   See Section 6.2.8.

7.10.1.  QTYPE is not NSEC3, NSEC3 RRset only

   The validator MUST check the response exactly as for a normal Name
   Error (RCODE=3) response.

7.10.2.  QTYPE is NSEC3, QNAME does not match

   The validator MUST check that an NSEC3 is present which covers the
   unhashed QNAME.


8.  Resolver Considerations

8.1.  NSEC3 Record Caching

   Caching resolvers MUST be able to retrieve the appropriate NSEC3
   RRsets when returning responses that contain them.  In standard
   DNSSEC, in many cases it is possible to find the correct NSEC record
   to return in a response by name (e.g., when returning a referral, the
   NSEC record will always have the same ownername as the delegation.)
   With this specification, that will not be true, nor will cache be
   able to calculate the name(s) of the appropriate NSEC3 RR(s).
   Implementations may need to use new methods for caching and
   retrieving NSEC3 resource records.

8.2.  Use of the AD bit

   The AD bit, as defined by [13] and [6], MUST NOT be set when
   returning a response containing a closest (provable) encloser proof
   in which the NSEC3 RR that covers the Next Closer Name has the Opt-
   Out bit set.

   This rule is based on what this sort of closest encloser proof
   actually proves: names that would be covered by the Opt-Out NSEC3 RR
   may or may not exist as insecure delegations.  As such, not all the
   data in responses containing such closest encloser proofs will have
   been cryptographically verified, so the AD bit cannot be set.


9.  Special Considerations

9.1.  Domain Name Length Restrictions

   Zones signed using this specification have additional domain name
   length restrictions imposed upon them.  In particular, zone with
   names that, when converted into hashed ownernames, exceed the 255
   octet length limit imposed by RFC 1035 [3].




Laurie, et al.          Expires December 27, 2006              [Page 22]

Internet-Draft                    nsec3                        June 2006


   Zones with names that exceed this limit cannot use this
   specification.

   The actual maximum length of a domain name in a particular zone
   depends on both the length of the zone name (versus the whole domain
   name) and the particular hash function used.

9.2.  Iterations

   [NOTE: should we actually base this on verifications, not signings?]

   Setting the number of iterations used allows the zone owner to choose
   the cost of computing a hash, and so the cost of generating a
   dictionary.  Note that this is distinct from the effect of salt,
   which prevents the use of a single precomputed dictionary for all
   time.

   Obviously the number of iterations also affects the zone owner's cost
   of signing the zone as well as the verifiers cost of verifying the
   zone.  We therefore impose an upper limit on the number of
   iterations.  We base this on the number of iterations that
   approximately doubles the cost of signing the zone.

   A zone owner MUST NOT use a value higher than shown in the table
   below for iterations.  A resolver MAY treat a response with a higher
   value as bogus.

                       +--------------+------------+
                       | RSA Key Size | Iterations |
                       +--------------+------------+
                       | 1024         | 3,000      |
                       | 2048         | 20,000     |
                       | 4096         | 150,000    |
                       +--------------+------------+

                       +--------------+------------+
                       | DSA Key Size | Iterations |
                       +--------------+------------+
                       | 1024         | 1,500      |
                       | 2048         | 5,000      |
                       +--------------+------------+

   This table is based on 150,000 SHA-1's per second, 50 RSA signs per
   second for 1024 bit keys, 7 signs per second for 2048 bit keys, 1
   sign per second for 4096 bit keys, 100 DSA signs per second for 1024
   bit keys and 30 signs per second for 2048 bit keys.

   Note that since RSA verifications are 10-100 times faster than

   signatures (depending on key size), in the case of RSA the legal
   values of iterations can substantially increase the cost of
   verification.

9.3.  Transitioning from a DNSSEC-standard Signed Zone

   To be added.


10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to allocate a RR type code for NSEC3 from the standard RR
   type space (type XXX requested).

   IANA needs to allocate two new DNSKEY algorithm identifiers.  One for
   DSA-NSEC3, one for RSASHA1-NSEC3.


11.  Security Considerations

11.1.  Hashing Considerations

11.1.1.  Dictionary Attacks

   The NSEC3 records are still susceptible to dictionary attacks (i.e.
   the attacker retrieves all the NSEC3 records, then calculates the
   hashes of all likely domain names, comparing against the hashes found
   in the NSEC3 records, and thus enumerating the zone).  These are
   substantially more expensive than enumerating the original NSEC
   records would have been, and in any case, such an attack could also
   be used directly against the name server itself by performing queries
   for all likely names, though this would obviously be more detectable.
   The expense of this off-line attack can be chosen by setting the
   number of iterations in the NSEC3 RR.

   Domains are also susceptible to a pre-calculated dictionary attack -
   that is, a list of hashes for all likely names is computed once, then
   NSEC3 is scanned periodically and compared against the precomputed
   hashes.  This attack is prevented by changing the salt on a regular
   basis.

11.1.2.  Collisions

   Hash collisions between QNAME and NSEC3 ownernames may occur.  When
   they do, it will be impossible to prove the non-existence of the
   colliding QNAME.  However, with SHA-1, this is fantastically unlikely
   (on the order of 1 in 2^160).  Note that DNSSEC already relies on the
   presumption that a cryptographic hash function is second pre-image



Laurie, et al.          Expires December 27, 2006              [Page 24]

Internet-Draft                    nsec3                        June 2006


   resistant, since these hash functions are used for generating and
   validating signatures and DS records.

11.1.3.  Using New or Unknown Hash Algorithms

   Since validators are instructed to ignore NSEC3 RRs with unknown hash
   algorithms, and to treat as insecure responses that only contain
   NSEC3 RRs with unknown hash algorithms, use of a new, not universally
   supported NSEC3 hash algorithm in a zone provides attackers with a
   possible downgrade attack.

   The attack is simply to remove any existing NSEC3 RRs from a
   response, and replace or add a single (or multiple) NSEC3 RR that
   uses the new or unknown hash algorithm to the response.  Validators
   will then be forced to treat the response as insecure.  This attack
   would be effective only when all of following conditions are met:

   o  There is at least one signed NSEC3 RRset that uses the new/unknown
      NSEC3 hash algorithm present in the zone.
   o  The attacker has access to one or more of these NSEC3 RRs.  This
      is trivially true when the NSEC3 RRs with the new/unknown hash
      algorithm are being returned in typical responses, but may also be
      true if the attacker can access the zone via AXFR or IXFR queries,
      or any other methodology.
   o  The receiving validating resolver is aware of this specification,
      but not aware of the new NSEC3 hash algorithm.

   Note that this possible downgrade attack is not possible against
   validating resolvers that recognize the new hash algorithm.

   Also note that it is likely that some subset of resolvers will treat
   responses from an NSEC3 signed zone as insecure anyway.  Using the
   new or unknown NSEC3 hash algorithm can be thought of as just adding
   more resolvers to that set.

11.2.  Opt-Out Considerations

   The Opt-Out Flag (O) allows for unsigned names, in the form of
   delegations to unsigned subzones, to exist within an otherwise signed
   zone.  All unsigned names are, by definition, insecure, and their
   validity or existence cannot be cryptographically proven.

   In general:

   o  Records with unsigned names (whether existing or not) suffer from
      the same vulnerabilities as records in an unsigned zone.  These
      vulnerabilities are described in more detail in [16] (note in
      particular sections 2.3, "Name Chaining" and 2.6, "Authenticated



Laurie, et al.          Expires December 27, 2006              [Page 25]

      Denial of Domain Names").
   o  Records with signed names have the same security whether or not
      Opt-Out is used.

   Note that with or without Opt-Out, an insecure delegation may be
   undetectably altered by an attacker.  Because of this, the primary
   difference in security when using Opt-Out is the loss of the ability
   to prove the existence or nonexistence of an insecure delegation
   within the span of an Opt-Out NSEC3 record.

   In particular, this means that a malicious entity may be able to
   insert or delete records with unsigned names.  These records are
   normally NS records, but this also includes signed wildcard
   expansions (while the wildcard record itself is signed, its expanded
   name is an unsigned name).

   Note that being able to add a delegation is functionally equivalent
   to being able to add any record type: an attacker merely has to forge
   a delegation to nameserver under his/her control and place whatever
   records needed at the subzone apex.

   While in particular cases, this issue may not present a significant
   security problem, in general it should not be lightly dismissed.
   Therefore, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that Opt-Out be used sparingly.
   In particular, zone signing tools SHOULD NOT default to using Opt-
   Out, and MAY choose to not support Opt-Out at all.

11.3.  NSEC-to-NSEC3 transition Considerations

   To Be Added.

11.4.  Other Considerations

   Walking the NSEC3 RRs will reveal the total number of records in the
   zone (plus empty non-terminals), and also what types they are.  This
   could be mitigated by adding dummy entries, but certainly an upper
   limit can always be found.

   The query returned three NSEC3 RRs that prove that the requested data

   does not exist and that no wildcard expansion applies.  The negative
   response is authenticated by verifying the NSEC3 RRs.  The
   corresponding RRSIGs indicate that the NSEC3s are signed by an
   "example" DNSKEY of algorithm 133 and with key tag 62827.  The
   resolver needs the corresponding DNSKEY RR in order to authenticate
   this answer.  One of the owner names of the NSEC3 RRs matches the
   closest encloser.  One of the NSEC3 RRs prove that there exists no
   longer name.  One of the NSEC3 RRs prove that there exists no
   wildcard RRsets that should have been expanded.  The closest encloser
   can be found by applying the algorithm in section Section 7.3

   In the above example, the name 'x.w.example' hashes to
   'b4um86eghhds6nea196smvmlo4ors995'.  This indicates that this might
   be the closest encloser.  To prove that 'c.x.w.example' and
   '*.x.w.example' do not exists, these names are hashed to respectively
   '0va5bpr2ou0vk0lbqeeljri88laipsfh' and
   '92pqneegtaue7pjatc3l3qnk738c6v5m'.  The first and last NSEC3 records
   prove that these hashed ownernames do not exists.

B.2.  No Data Error

   A "no data" response.  The NSEC3 RR proves that the name exists and
   that the requested RR type does not.

   The query returned an answer that was produced as a result of
   wildcard expansion.  The answer section contains a wildcard RRset
   expanded as it would be in a traditional DNS response.  The RRSIG
   labels field value of 2 indicates that the answer is the result of
   wildcard expansion, as the "a.z.w.example" name contains 4 labels.
   This also shows that "w.example" exists, so there is no need for an
   NSEC3 that matches the Closest Encloser.

   The NSEC3 proves that no closer match could have been used to answer
   this query.

B.5.  Wildcard No Data Error

   A "no data" response for a name covered by a wildcard.  The NSEC3 RRs
   prove that the matching wildcard name does not have any RRs of the
   requested type and that no closer match exists in the zone.

Appendix C.  Special Considerations

   The following paragraphs clarify specific behaviour and explain
   special considerations for implementations.

C.1.  Salting

   Augmenting original ownernames with salt before hashing increases the
   cost of a dictionary of pre-generated hash-values.  For every bit of



Laurie, et al.          Expires December 27, 2006              [Page 42]

Internet-Draft                    nsec3                        June 2006


   salt, the cost of a precomputed dictionary doubles (because there
   must be an entry for each word combined with each possible salt
   value).  The NSEC3 RR can use a maximum of 2040 bits (255 octets) of
   salt, multiplying the cost by 2^2040.  This means that an attacker
   must, in practice, recompute the dictionary each time the salt is
   changed.

   There MUST be at least one complete set of NSEC3s for the zone using
   the same salt value.

   The salt SHOULD be changed periodically to prevent pre-computation
   using a single salt.  It is RECOMMENDED that the salt be changed for
   every resigning.

   Note that this could cause a resolver to see records with different
   salt values for the same zone.  This is harmless, since each record
   stands alone (that is, it denies the set of ownernames whose hashes,
   using the salt in the NSEC3 record, fall between the two hashes in
   the NSEC3 record) - it is only the server that needs a complete set
   of NSEC3 records with the same salt in order to be able to answer
   every possible query.

   There is no prohibition with having NSEC3 with different salts within
   the same zone.  However, in order for authoritative servers to be
   able to consistently find covering NSEC3 RRs, the authoritative
   server MUST choose a single set of parameters (algorithm, salt, and
   iterations) to use when selecting NSEC3s.  In the absence of any
   other metadata, the server does this by using the parameters from the
   zone apex NSEC3, recognizable by the presence of the SOA bit in the
   type map.  If there is more than one NSEC3 record that meets this
   description, then the server may arbitrarily choose one.  Because of
   this, if there is a zone apex NSEC3 RR within a zone, it MUST be part
   of a complete NSEC3 set.  Conversely, if there exists an incomplete
   set of NSEC3 RRs using the same parameters within a zone, there MUST
   NOT be an NSEC3 RR using those parameters with the SOA bit set.

C.2.  Hash Collision

   Hash collisions occur when different messages have the same hash
   value.  The expected number of domain names needed to give a 1 in 2
   chance of a single collision is about 2^(n/2) for a hash of length n
   bits (i.e. 2^80 for SHA-1).  Though this probability is extremely
   low, the following paragraphs deal with avoiding collisions and
   assessing possible damage in the event of an attack using hash
   collisions.

Internet-Draft                    nsec3                        June 2006


C.2.1.  Avoiding Hash Collisions during generation

   During generation of NSEC3 RRs, hash values are supposedly unique.
   In the (academic) case of a collision occurring, an alternative salt
   MUST be chosen and all hash values MUST be regenerated.

C.2.2.  Second Preimage Requirement Analysis

   A cryptographic hash function has a second-preimage resistance
   property.  The second-preimage resistance property means that it is
   computationally infeasible to find another message with the same hash
   value as a given message, i.e. given preimage X, to find a second
   preimage X' != X such that hash(X) = hash(X').  The work factor for
   finding a second preimage is of the order of 2^160 for SHA-1.  To
   mount an attack using an existing NSEC3 RR, an adversary needs to
   find a second preimage.

   Assuming an adversary is capable of mounting such an extreme attack,
   the actual damage is that a response message can be generated which
   claims that a certain QNAME (i.e. the second pre-image) does exist,
   while in reality QNAME does not exist (a false positive), which will
   either cause a security aware resolver to re-query for the non-
   existent name, or to fail the initial query.  Note that the adversary
   can't mount this attack on an existing name but only on a name that
   the adversary can't choose and does not yet exist.

C.2.3.  Possible Hash Value Truncation Method

   The previous sections outlined the low probability and low impact of
   a second-preimage attack.  When impact and probability are low, while
   space in a DNS message is costly, truncation is tempting.  Truncation
   might be considered to allow for shorter ownernames and RDATA for
   hashed labels.  In general, if a cryptographic hash is truncated to n
   bits, then the expected number of domains required to give a 1 in 2
   probability of a single collision is approximately 2^(n/2) and the
   work factor to produce a second preimage is 2^n.

   An extreme hash value truncation would be truncating to the shortest
   possible unique label value.  This would be unwise, since the work
   factor to produce second preimages would then approximate the size of
   the zone (sketch of proof: if the zone has k entries, then the length
   of the names when truncated down to uniqueness should be proportional
   to log_2(k).  Since the work factor to produce a second pre-image is
   2^n for an n-bit hash, then in this case it is 2^(C log_2(k)) (where
   C is some constant), i.e.  C'k - a work factor of k).

   Though the mentioned truncation can be maximized to a certain
   extreme, the probability of collision increases exponentially for

   every truncated bit.  Given the low impact of hash value collisions
   and limited space in DNS messages, the balance between truncation
   profit and collision damage may be determined by local policy.  Of
   course, the size of the corresponding RRSIG RR is not reduced, so
   truncation is of limited benefit.

   Truncation could be signaled simply by reducing the length of the
   first label in the ownername.  Note that there would have to be a
   corresponding reduction in the length of the Next Hashed Ownername
   field.
