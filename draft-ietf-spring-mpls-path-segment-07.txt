           Path Segment in MPLS Based Segment Routing Network
                 draft-ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment-07

Abstract

   A Segment Routing (SR) path is identified by an SR segment list.
   Only the complete segment list can identify the end-to-end SR path,
   and a sub-set of segments from the segment list cannot distinguish
   one SR path from another as they may be partially congruent.  SR path
   identification is a pre-requisite for various use-cases such as
   Performance Measurement (PM), bidirectional paths correlation, and
   end-to-end 1+1 path protection.

   In SR for MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS), the segment identifiers are
   stripped from the packet through label popping as the packet transits
   the network.  This means that when a packet reaches the egress of the
   SR path, it is not possible to determine on which SR path it
   traversed the network.

   This document defines a new type of segment that is referred to as
   Path Segment, which is used to identify an SR path in an SR-MPLS
   network.  When used, it is inserted by the ingress node of the SR
   path and immediately follows the last segment identifier in the
   segment list of the SR path.  The Path Segment is preserved until it
   reaches the egress node for SR path identification and correlation.

Internet-Draft           Path Segment in SR-MPLS           December 2021


1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] leverages the source-routing paradigm
   to steer packets from a source node through a controlled set of
   instructions, called segments, by prepending the packet with an SR
   header in the MPLS data plane SR-MPLS [RFC8660] through a label stack
   or IPv6 data plane using an SRH header via SRv6 [RFC8986] to
   construct an SR path.

   In an SR-MPLS network, when a packet is transmitted along an SR path,
   the labels in the MPLS label stack will be swapped or popped.  The
   consequence of this is that no label or only the last label (e.g.
   Explicit-Null label) may be left in the MPLS label stack when the
   packet reaches the egress node.  Thus, the egress node cannot
   determine along which SR path the packet was received.

   However, to support various use-cases in SR-MPLS networks, like end-
   to-end 1+1 path protection (Live-Live case) [RFC4426], bidirectional
   path [RFC5654], or Performance Measurement (PM) [RFC7799], the
   ability to implement path identification on the egress node is a pre-
   requisite.

   Therefore, this document introduces a new segment type that is
   referred to as the Path Segment.  A Path Segment is defined to
   uniquely identify an SR path in an SR-MPLS network in the context of
   the egress node.  It is normally used by the egress nodes for path
   identification hence to support various use-cases including SR path
   PM, end-to-end 1+1 SR path protection, and bidirectional SR paths
   correlation.

2.  Path Segment

   A Path Segment is a single label that is assigned from the Segment
   Routing Local Block (SRLB) [RFC8402] or Segment Routing Global Block
   (SRGB) [RFC8402] or dynamic MPLS label pool of the egress node of an
   SR path.  It means that the Path Segment is unique in the context of
   the egress node of the SR path.  When a Path Segment is used, the
   Path Segment MUST be inserted at the ingress node and MUST
   immediately follow the last label of the SR path, in other words,
   inserted after the routing segment (adjacency/node/prefix segment)
   pointing to the egress node.

   The term of SR path used in this document is a general term that can
   be used to describe a SR Policy, a Candidate-Path (CP), or a SID List
   (SL) [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  Therefore, the Path
   Segment may be used to identify an SR Policy, its CP, or a SL
   terminating on an egress node depending on the use-case.

   The value of the TTL field in the MPLS label stack entry containing
   the Path Segment MUST be set to the same value as the TTL of the last
   label stack entry for the last segment in the SR path.  If the Path
   Segment is the bottom label, the S bit MUST be set.

   A Path Segment can be used in the case of Penultimate Hop Popping
   (PHP), where some labels are be popped off at the penultimate hop of
   an SR path, but the Path Segment MUST NOT be popped off until it
   reaches the egress node.

   The egress node MUST pop the Path Segment.  The egress node MAY use
   the Path Segment for further processing.  For example, when
   performance measurement is enabled on the SR path, it can trigger
   packet counting or timestamping.

   In some deployments, service labels may be added after the Path
   Segment label in the MPLS label stack.  In this case, the egress node
   MUST be capable of processing more than one label.  The additional
   processing required, may have an impact on forwarding performance.

   Generic Associated Label (GAL) is used for Operations, Administration
   and Maintenance (OAM) in MPLS networks [RFC5586].  When GAL is used,
   it MUST be added at the bottom of the label stack after the Path
   Segment label.

   Entropy label and Entropy Label Indicator (ELI) as described in
   [RFC8662] for SR-MPLS path, can be placed before or after the Path
   Segment label in the MPLS label stack.

   The SR path computation needs to know the Maximum SID Depth (MSD)
   that can be imposed at each node/link of a given SR path [RFC8664].
   This ensures that the SID stack depth of a computed path does not
   exceed the number of SIDs the node is capable of imposing.  Adding a
   Path Segment to a label stack will increase the depth of the label
   stack, the Path Segment MUST be accounted when considering MSD.

   The label stack with Path Segment is shown in Figure 1:

               +--------------------+
               |       ...          |
               +--------------------+

               +--------------------+
               |       ...          |

   *  The Path Segment identifies the SR path in the context of the
      egress node of the SR path.

   There may be multiple paths (or sub-path(s)) carried in the label
   stack, for each path (or sub-path), there may be a corresponding Path
   Segment carried.  A use case can be found in Section 4.

3.  Path Segment Allocation

   Several ways can be used to allocate the Path Segment.

   One way is to set up a communication channel (e.g., MPLS Generic
   Associated Channel (G-ACh)) [RFC5586] between the ingress node and
   the egress node, and the ingress node of the SR path can directly
   send a request to the egress node to allocate a Path Segment.  The
   detail of G-ACh based solution is left for future study and out of
   the scope of this document.

   Another way is to leverage a centralized controller (e.g., SDN
   controller) to assign the Path Segment.  In this case, the controller
   will deliver the Path Segment and corresponding path information
   (e.g., SR policy) to the ingress node.  Path Computation Element
   Communication Protocol (PCEP) based Path Segment allocation for SR
   Policy is defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-path-segment], BGP based Path
   Segment allocation for SR Policy is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-sr-policy-path-segment].  At the same time, the
   controller MUST make sure (e.g., by some capability discovery
   mechanisms outside the scope of this document) that the egress node
   knows the Path Segment and it can process it, as well as the label
   does not collide with any label allocation done by the egress node.

4.  Nesting of Path Segments

   Binding SID (BSID) [RFC8402] can be used for SID list compression.
   With BSID, an end-to-end SR path can be split into several sub-paths,
   each sub-path is identified by a BSID.  Then an end-to-end SR path
   can be identified by a list of BSIDs, therefore, it can provide
   better scalability.

Internet-Draft           Path Segment in SR-MPLS           December 2021


   BSID and Path Segment ID (PSID) can be combined to achieve both sub-
   path and end-to-end path monitoring.  A reference model for such a
   combination in (Figure 2) shows an end-to-end path (A->D) that spans
   three domains (Access, Aggregation and Core domain) and consists of
   three sub-paths, one in each sub-domain (sub-path (A->B), sub-path
   (B->C) and sub-path (C->D)).  Each sub-path is allocated a BSID.  For
   nesting the sub-paths, each sub-path is allocated a PSID.  Then, the
   SID list of the end-to-end path can be expressed as <BSID1, BSID2,
   ..., BSIDn, e-PSID>, where the e-PSID is the PSID of the end-to-end
   path.  The SID list of a sub-path can be expressed as <SID1, SID2,
   ...SIDn, s-PSID>, where the s-PSID is the PSID of the sub-path.

   Figure 2 shows the details of the label stacks when PSID and BSID are
   used to support both sub-path and end-to-end path monitoring in a
   multi-domain scenario.

5.  Path Segment for Performance Measurement

   As defined in [RFC7799], performance measurement can be classified
   into Passive, Active, and Hybrid measurement.  Since Path Segment is
   encoded in the SR-MPLS Label Stack as shown in Figure 1, existing
   implementation on the egress node can be leveraged for measuring
   packet counts using the incoming SID (the Path Segment).  A different
   scheme such as carrying such identifier after the bottom of the label

Internet-Draft           Path Segment in SR-MPLS           December 2021


   stack may require new implementation.

   For Passive performance measurement, path identification at the
   measuring points is the prerequisite.  Path Segment can be used by
   the measuring points (e.g., the ingress and egress nodes of the SR
   path or a centralized controller) to measure packet counts on the
   egress node and to correlate the packet counters and timestamps from
   the ingress and egress nodes for a specific SR path, then packet loss
   and delay can be calculated for the end-to-end path, respectively.

   Path Segment can also be used for Active performance measurement for
   an end-to-end SR path in SR-MPLS networks for measuring packet counts
   on the egress node and for collecting the packet counters and
   timestamps from the egress node associated with the SR path using
   probe messages [I-D.ietf-mpls-rfc6374-sr] and
   [I-D.ietf-spring-stamp-srpm].

   Path Segment can also be used for In-situ OAM (IOAM) for SR-MPLS to
   identify the SR path associated with the in-situ data fields in the
   data packets on the egress node [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   Path Segment can also be used for In-band PM with Alternate Marking
   Method for SR-MPLS to identify the SR Path associated with the
   performance metrics collected
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-inband-pm-encapsulation].

6.  Path Segment for Bidirectional SR Path

   In some scenarios, for example, mobile backhaul transport networks,
   there are requirements to support bidirectional paths, and the path
   is normally treated as a single entity.  The both directions of the
   path have the same fate, for example, failure in one direction will
   result in switching traffic at both directions.  MPLS supports this
   by introducing the concepts of co-routed bidirectional LSP and
   associated bidirectional LSP [RFC5654].

   In the current SR architecture, an SR path is a unidirectional path
   [RFC8402].  In order to support bidirectional SR paths, a
   straightforward way is to bind two unidirectional SR paths to a
   single bidirectional SR path.  Path Segments can then be used to
   identify and correlate the traffic for the two unidirectional SR
   paths at both ends of the bidirectional path.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path] defines procedures on how to use PCEP
   for SR Policy to initiate a bidirectional SR path.  Also,
   [I-D.ietf-idr-sr-policy-path-segment] defines procedures on how to
   use BGP for SR Policy to initiate a bidirectional SR path.

7.  Path Segment for End-to-end Path Protection

   For end-to-end 1+1 path protection (i.e., Live-Live case), the egress
   node of the path needs to know the set of paths that constitute the
   primary and the secondaries, in order to select the primary path
   packets for onward transmission, and to discard the packets from the
   secondaries [RFC4426].

   To do this in Segment Routing, each SR path needs a path identifier
   that is unique at the egress node.  For SR-MPLS, this can be the Path
   Segment label allocated by the egress node.

   There then needs to be a method of binding this SR path identifiers
   into equivalence groups such that the egress node can determine for
   example, the set of packets that represent a single primary path.  It
   is obvious that this equivalence group can be instantiated in the
   network by an SDN controller using the Path Segments of the SR paths.

8.  Security Considerations

   Path Segment in SR-MPLS does not introduce any new behavior or any
   change in the way the MPLS data plane works.  Section 8.1 of
   [RFC8402] describe the security consideration for SR-MPLS.  Path
   segment is additional metadata that is added to the packet consisting
   of the SR path.

   An attacker could exploit path segment to manipulate the accounting
   of SR traffic at the egress.  Path segment could also be used to
   monitor traffic patterns for the E2E paths.  The control protocols
   used to allocate path segments could also be exploited to disseminate
   incorrect path segment information.  Note that, the path segment is
   imposed at the ingress and removed at the egress boundary and is not
   leaked out of the administered domain.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA actions.
