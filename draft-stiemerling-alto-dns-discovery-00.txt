Internet-Draft          DNS-based ALTO Discovery               July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Networking applications today already have access to a great amount
   of Inter-Provider network topology information.  For example, views
   of the Internet routing table are easily available at looking glass
   servers and entirely practical to be downloaded by clients.  What is
   missing is knowledge of the underlying network topology from the ISP
   or Content Provider (henceforth referred as Provider) point of view.
   In other words, what a Provider prefers in terms of traffic
   optimization -- and a way to distribute it.

   The ALTO Service provides information such as preferences of network
   resources with the goal of modifying network resource consumption
   patterns while maintaining or improving application performance.
   This document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO Service.
   While such service would primarily be provided by the network (i.e.,
   the ISP), content providers and third parties could also operate this
   service.  Applications that could use this service are those that
   have a choice in connection endpoints.  Examples of such applications
   are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.

   This document specifies the U-NAPTR based resolution process.  To
   start the U-NAPTR resolution process a domain name needs to be
   obtained first.  One mechanism to obtain such a domain name is via
   DHCP, as described in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lis-discovery].


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  U-NAPTR Resolution

   ALTO servers are identified by U-NAPTR/DDDS (URI-Enabled NAPTR/
   Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service) [RFC4848] application unique
   strings, in the form of a DNS name.  An example is
   'altoserver.example.com'.

   Clients need to use the U-NAPTR [RFC4848] specification described
   below to obtain a URI (indicating host and protocol) for the
   applicable ALTO service.  In this document, only the HTTP and HTTPS
   URL schemes are defined.  Note that the HTTP URL can be any valid
   HTTP URL, including those containing path elements.

   The following two DNS entries show the U-NAPTR resolution for
   "example.com" to the HTTPS URL https://altoserver.example.com/secure
   or the HTTP URL http://altoserver.example.com, with the former being
   preferred.


       example.com.

       IN NAPTR 100  10   "u"    "ALTO:https"
            "!.*!https://altoserver.example.com/secure!"  ""

       IN NAPTR 200  10   "u"    "ALTO:http"
            "!.*!http://altoserver.example.com!"  ""

   End host learn the ALTO's server host name by means beyond the scope
   of this specification, such as DHCP.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following U-NAPTR application service
   tag:
      Application Service Tag:  ALTO
      Defining Publication:  The specification contained within this
         document.

   This document registers the following U-NAPTR application protocol
   tags:
   o  Application Protocol Tag:  http

      Defining Publication:  RFC 2616 [RFC2616]
   o  Application Protocol Tag:  https

      Defining Publication:  RFC 2818 [RFC2818]


5.  Security Considerations

   The address of a ALTO is usually well-known within an access network;
   therefore, interception of messages does not introduce any specific
   concerns.

   The primary attack against the methods described in this document is
   one that would lead to impersonation of a ALTO server since a device
   does not necessarily have a prior relationship with a ALTO server.

   An attacker could attempt to compromise ALTO discovery at any of
   three stages:

   1.  1. providing a falsified domain name to be used as input to
       U-NAPTR
   2.  2. altering the DNS records used in U-NAPTR resolution
   3.  3. impersonation of the ALTO

   This document focuses on the U-NAPTR resolution process and hence
   this section discusses the security considerations related to the DNS
   handling.  The security aspects of obtaining the domain name that is
   used for input to the U-NAPTR process is described in respective
   documents, such as [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lis-discovery].

   The domain name that is used to authenticated the ALTO server is the
   domain name in the URI that is the result of the U-NAPTR resolution.
   Therefore, if an attacker were able to modify or spoof any of the DNS
   records used in the DDDS resolution, this URI could be replaced by an
   invalid URI.  The application of DNS security (DNSSEC) [RFC4033]
   provides a means to limit attacks that rely on modification of the
   DNS records used in U-NAPTR resolution.  Security considerations
   specific to U-NAPTR are described in more detail in [RFC4848].

   An "https:" URI is authenticated using the method described in
   Section 3.1 of [RFC2818].  The domain name used for this
   authentication is the domain name in the URI resulting from U-NAPTR
   resolution, not the input domain name as in [RFC3958].  Using the
   domain name in the URI is more compatible with existing HTTP client
   software, which authenticate servers based on the domain name in the
   URI.

   An ALTO server that is identified by an "http:" URI cannot be
   authenticated.  If an "http:" URI is the product of the ALTO
   discovery, this leaves devices vulnerable to several attacks.  Lower
   layer protections, such as layer 2 traffic separation might be used
   to provide some guarantees.
