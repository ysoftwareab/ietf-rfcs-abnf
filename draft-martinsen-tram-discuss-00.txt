Abstract

   This draft describes a mechanism for information exchange between an
   application and the network.  The information provided from the
   application to the network MAY be used by a network element in the
   path to modify its behavior to improve application quality of
   experience (QoE).  Likewise, the information provided by the network
   to the application MAY be used by the application to modify its
   behavior to optimize for QoE.

1.  Introduction

   In the context of Content, Mobile, Fixed Service, Service Providers,
   Enterprise and Private networks have a need to prioritize packet
   flows end-to-end.  These flows are often dynamic, time-bound,
   encrypted, peer-to-peer, possibly asymmetric, and might have
   different priorities depending on network conditions, direction, time
   of the day, dynamic user preferences and other factors.  These
   factors may be time variant, and thus need to be signalled.
   Moreover, in many cases of peer-to-peer communication, flow
   information is known only to the endpoint.  These considerations,
   coupled with the trend to use encryption for browser-to-browser
   communication [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch], imply that access
   lists, deep packet inspection and other static prioritization methods
   cannot be employed successfully to prioritize packet flows.

   There is a need for a solution that is easy for the application
   developer to use.  That means consistent behaviour on all supported

   platforms and preferably without need of administrative privileges to
   set and read values.  The solution also needs to be able to cross
   administrative domains without the risk of being rewritten.  [[Q1:
   This draft will only offer tamper detection of some of the values.
   Further discussion regarding the incentive to lie is needed.
   --palmarti]]

   This draft describes how these problems can be solved by defining a
   few strictly defined STUN [RFC5389] attributes which can be added to
   any STUN message the client wants to send.  STUN messages are
   typically sent during the ICE [RFC5245] connectivity check phase when
   the media session is established, or when keep-alive STUN messages
   are sent after the session is established.  The application is not
   limited to those two scenarios, if some communication between
   application and network is needed it can choose to do so at any time.

   Devices on the media path can use the information in the STUN
   attributes to prioritize the flow, perform traffic engineering,
   provide network analytics or as a gateway to existing methods for
   prioritizing flows (DSCP [RFC2474]).  Applications can use
   information in network status attribute to influence rate stating
   points or rate adaption mechanisms.

   The functionality described here is referred to as DISCUSS.  Due to
   the security implications described in
   [I-D.thomson-mmusic-ice-webrtc] where large STUN packet are used
   amplify an attack, keeping the added STUN attributes is an important
   design consideration.  To avoid unwanted information leakage the new
   defined STUN attributes are strictly defined in this draft.

2.  General Usage

   This draft defines several attributes that can be added to a STUN
   message; STREAM-TYPE, BANDWIDTH-USAGE, STREAM-PRIORITY and NETWORK-
   STATUS.  See Section 6 for the formal description.  It is RECOMMENDED
   to add them to a STUN request response pair, especially if the
   NETWORK-STATUS attribute is in use.  This allows the information
   gathered to be sent back to the requesting agent in the the STUN
   response.

   The STREAM-TYPE, BANDWIDTH-USAGE, STREAM-PRIORITY attributes MUST be
   added before any INTEGRITY attribute.  It is RECOMMENDED to only add
   these attributes to STUN messages containing a INTEGRITY attribute as
   this prevents tampering with the content of the attribute.

   If the client wants to receive feedback from the network it must add
   a null NETWORK-STATUS attribute.  A null NETWORK_STATUS attribute
   consists of the attribute with the Node Cnt field set to zero (0) and



Martinsen & Wildfeuer    Expires August 16, 2014                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                   DISCUSS                   February 2014


   the CS bit set to 0 (Off).  This attribute MUST be added after the
   INTEGRITY attribute, as on-path devices may write information into
   this attribute.  Having a readily available attribute to write into
   will save the the on-path device from growing buffers to add their
   own attribute.  On path devices SHOULD not add their own NETWORK-
   STATUS attribute (or any other STUN attribute).

   If an agent receives a STUN request with a NETWORK-STATUS attribute
   after the INTEGRITY attribute, it should copy the content into a new
   NETWORK-STATUS attribute and add it before the INTEGRITY attribute
   when sending the STUN response.  A new null NETWORK-STATUS attribute
   can be added after the INTEGRITY attribute.  New STUN attributes
   described in this draft can also be added describing the stream in
   this direction.

   If an agent receives a STUN response with a NETWORK-STATUS attribute
   before the INTEGRITY attribute, this describes the stream in the
   upstream direction.  A NETWORK-STATUS attribute after the INTEGRITY
   attribute describes the stream in the downstream direction.

   It might make sense to distinguish DISCUSS packets from normal STUN
   packets.  This would prevent unnecessary processing of normal STUN
   packets on the network nodes.

   [[Q2: A few alternatives (Needs discussion): ---1: Alter the STUN
   magic cookie.  (But than i would not be a STUN packet anymore, and
   that raises a new set of problems) ---2: Add a special this is
   DISCUSS attribute.  This must be the first attribute in the message.
   This allows for network node to look for DISCUSS packets at a fixed
   offset without needing to parse the entire packet.  ---3: Alter the
   transaction id.  This might be problematic if using it in conjunction
   with ICE connectivity checks.  But probably fine in other scenarios.
   ---4: Define a new STUN Method.  Also brakes ICE, makes it harder to
   tag onto attributes to already in use messages.  --palmarti]]

   [[Q3: Do we want to restrict this to req/resp or do we want to allow
   for the attributes to be added in this fashion for indications as
   well? --palmarti]]

                           DISCUSS example flow

   1.  Alice creates a Binding Request, adds STREAM-TYPE, BANDWIDTH-
       USAGE, STREAM-PRIORITY attributes before the INTEGRITY attribute
       and a single null NETWORK-STATUS attribute after the INTEGRITY
       attribute.

   2.  Router1 inspects the STUN Request message and reads any STREAM-
       TYPE, BANDWIDTH-USAGE, or STREAM-PRIORITY attributes and the
       information they contain.  It then updates the NETWORK-STATUS
       attribute with any information the router have.  It then forwards
       the request.

   3.  Bob processes the STUN Request.  When Bob builds the response, it
       copies the NETWORK-STATUS attribute into the STUN Response before
       the INTEGRITY check and adds new null NETWORK-STATUS attribute
       after the INTEGRITY attribute.  Bob then transmits the message.

   4.  Router2 (first DISCUSS network element for the downstream
       direction) inspects the Response message, reads the STREAM-TYPE,
       BANDWIDTH-USAGE, or STREAM-PRIORITY attributes and MAY alter the
       NETWORK-STATUS attribute located after the INTEGRITY attribute.
       It then transmits the message.

   5.  When Alice receives the STUN Response, she can extract the
       STREAM-TYPE, BANDWIDTH-USAGE, or STREAM-PRIORITY attributes and
       the two NETWORK-STATUS attributes to get a complete picture of
       what the remote agent is sending and how the status of both the
       upstream and downstream path.

3.  Network Processing

   This section describes the processing of DISCUSS packets by network
   devices.

3.1.  Packet Processing by Network Device

   Network devices are said to support DISCUSS if they perform
   inspection of packets being forward or switched in order to identify
   an DISCUSS STUN packet.  These devices will also be able to read/
   write STUN attributes to/from this packet.  It is not required that
   every network device in the path support DISCUSS.  It is expected
   that DISCUSS will have the most value being implemented at certain
   points in the network (PIN's) such as WAN edge devices, wireless
   access devices, and Internet gateways.

   Network devices that support DISCUSS MAY utilize the information
   provided by the application in the STUN attributes to modify their
   behavior.  These include the attributes defined in this document with
   the exception of the NETWORK-STATUS attribute.  The NETWORK-STATUS
   attribute SHOULD NOT be used by the DISCUSS capable network device to
   modify its behavior.  The intent of the NEWTORK-STATUS attribute is
   for the application to modify its behavior.

   If the NETWORK-STATUS attributes exists in a DISCUSS packet after an
   INTEGRITY attribute, the DISCUSS capable network device MUST process
   it as described in this section.  NETWORK-STATUS attributes that
   exist before the INTEGRITY attribute MUST NOT be modified by the
   network device.  The modifications to the NETWORK-STATUS attribute
   are:

   o  Update the Node Cnt field in the attribute.  The device SHALL
      increment this field by one unless it is at its maximum
      (saturated) value.  If the field is at its maximum value, the
      device SHALL NOT modify this field.

   o  Overwrite the attribute CS bit if the value at this device is
      "worst" than the current value.  In other words, only write to
      this bit if the device is experiencing congestion on relevant
      queues/interfaces for this flow AND the current value of this
      field is 0 (Off).

   The determination of congestion at a device is out of the scope of
   this document.  Setting of CS bit to On by the device is meant to
   provide direct feedback to the application of potential or current
   loss of packets in its flow (s).  The application can then react to
   this indication by altering its encoding of information in the packet
   to deal with congestion/packet loss, e.g. reduce its encoding rate or



Martinsen & Wildfeuer    Expires August 16, 2014                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                   DISCUSS                   February 2014


   switch to embedded encoding.  Devices SHOULD ensure that the DISCUSS
   capable applications that do react to congestion notification by
   reducing their transmission rate be treated properly to ensure
   fairness with non reacting applications (i.e. ensure fairness for
   well behaving applications).

   The DISCUSS STUN packet SHOULD experience minimal extra processing
   delay through the DISCUSS capable network device relative to non-
   DISCUSS packets in the flow.  The DISCUSS STUN packet MAY be placed
   out of order in the packet flow, but SHOULD NOT be delayed more than
   a few packet interval times.

3.2.  Interaction with DSCP

   One of the attributes that may be added to the STUN packet by the
   application is the STREAM-PRIORITY attribute.  This attribute
   indicates the relative priority of streams inside of an application
   session.  This attribute is compatible with the use of DSCP (or other
   priority markings) at the networking layer as described in this
   section.

   Since transport layer markings may be modified by middle boxes or
   devices in the path or at the interface of the application itself due
   to the lack of support in the OS network stack, the STREAM-PRIORITY
   attribute can be used as a mechanism for ensuring proper QoS
   treatment through multiple domains.  DISCUSS capable device may use
   the STREAM-PRIORITY attribute to remark the DSCP value to the
   appropriate value.  DSCP re-marking based on STREAM-PRIORITY
   attribute may make sense at certain PIN's, e.g. gateway between
   network domains (e.g. managed network to/from Internet), access
   switches in managed network, etc.  The translation from the Priority
   number in the STREAM-PRIORITY attribute to the correct transport
   layer marking (e.g. DSCP) is implementation specific and out of the
   scope of this document.

   [I-D.dhesikan-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos] provides the recommended DSCP values
   for webrtc enabled browsers to use for various classes of traffic.

4.  Interaction with ICE

   An ICE connectivity check is performed by sending a STUN Binding
   indication.  Prior to sending the agent can add one STREAM-TYPE
   attribute.  If added, only one MUST be added.  This is to avoid
   unnecessary large STUN packets during the connectivity checks.  If
   the connectivity check is sent on a 5-tuple that multiplexes
   different types of media and more detailed information wants to be
   signalled it should be done after the connectivity check phase is
   finished.

Internet-Draft                   DISCUSS                   February 2014


   This limits the information the STUN messages are able to convey
   during the connectivity checks, but also avoids adding network
   confusion with BANDWIDTH-USAGE attributes describing different paths
   that never going to be utilized.

   [[Q4: Problem with consent freshness if not based on STUN.
   --palmarti]]

5.  Multiplexed Streams

   In some scenarios a 5-tuple can be used to transport several media
   streams.  BUNDLE [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] describes
   such a mechanism.

   When describing the stream with a STREAM-TYPE attribute there are two
   possibilities to describe the streams that are multiplexed.  Adding
   one attribute for each type (Audio, Video,++), or to save a few bits
   on the wire it is also possible to construct the STREAM-TYPE so a one
   type value describes several types.  For example audio have the value
   of 1 and application data have the value of 4.  If the STREAM_TYPE
   value is set to 5 the only combination that gives that is audio and
   application data.

   The other attributes BANDWIDTH-USAGE, STREAM-PRIORITY and NETWORK-
   STATUS SHOULD only be added once as they describe the behaviour of
   the 5-tuple and not individual streams.

6.  New STUN attributes

   This STUN extension defines the following new attributes:

         0xXXX0: STREAM-TYPE
         0xXXX1: BANDWIDTH-USAGE
         0xXXX2: STREAM-PRIORITY
         0xYYYY: NETWORK-STATUS

6.1.  STREAM-TYPE

   This attribute have a length that are multiples of 4 (32) so no
   padding is necessary.

                      Figure 1: STREAM TYPE Attribute

   TYPE:  STREAM TYPE is a 16 bit value defined in Figure 2 below
      describing the flow.

        0x0001 Audio

        0x02 Interactive

                       Figure 3: Interactivity Types

   It is possible to combine the stream types if a stream contains more
   than one type.

   If a 5-tuple is used to send both a audio and video stream, the
   stream type can be set to 0x0006.  This can be useful if the
   application wants to hint that the 5-tuple contains several streams,
   This is useful if the attribute is added to STUN binding requests
   during ICE connectivity checks.  If more information regarding
   multiplexed streams is needed it is possible to add more than one
   attribute to a STUN message (See section ??).  This can be done to
   STUN messages that are being sent after the connectivity check phase
   is finished (Keepalive, consent freshness).  During this phase the
   added size of the STUN messages pose no security threat.

6.2.  BANDWIDTH-USAGE

      movements in the picture my lead to this value being inaccurate.

                    Figure 5: STREAM PRIORITY Attribute

   Priority:  Describes this streams priority among other streams coming
      from this endpoint/application (With same session ID).  Values
      range from 255 (0xFF) to 0.

   D: Delay sensitive.  The application can set this bit as a hint to
      the network element that the stream is delay sensitive.  (Unsure
      if this is useful)

   Stream IDX:  Application can choose set this to ease debugging in the
      network.  A reasonable value can foe example be the index have in
      the SDP.

   Session ID:  Identification to distinguish what session this stream
      is part of.  This MUST have the same value for all the media

      streams the application wants to give differentiated services.
      (Note that this ID may overlap with other streams that originates
      from a different IP address.  The network element MUST only
      prioritize among streams with the same Session Id originating from
      the same IP)

6.4.  NETWORK-STATUS

   This attribute have a length that are multiples of 4 (32) so no
   padding is necessary.  The values are kept in the same attribute to
   make it easier for the network element to process it.  Only one
   attribute, with static placement of the fields.  [[Q5: Does this
   matter?  Could we have several attributes with possible different
   ordering without any problem for the network element?  --palmarti]]

   This attribute MUST be added after any INTEGRITY attribute in the
   STUN message.  Values in this attribute can be updated along the
   network path by nodes that are not able to regenerate a correct
   INTEGRITY attribute.

                    Figure 6: NETWORK-STATUS Attribute

   CS:  Congestion Status.  This bit is set to indicate that there is
      congestion at the network device's relevant queues/interfaces for
      this flow.  The network element should set this bit to 1 (On) if
      it is experiencing congestion.  This bit is set to 0 (off) when
      the attribute is created by the application.  The application that
      sees this bit set might act on it by doing some rate adaption or
      similar action.

   Node Cnt:  Numbers of nodes that supports DISCUSS in the network
      path.  Any router on the path that understands DISCUSS should
      increase this number.  This field is set to 0 when the attribute
      is created by the application.
