                        "X-" Considered Harmful
              draft-saintandre-xdash-considered-harmful-01

Abstract

   Many application protocols use named parameters to represent data
   (for example, header fields in Internet mail messages and HTTP
   requests).  Historically, protocol designers and implementers have
   often differentiated between "standard" and "experimental" parameters
   by prefixing experimental parameters with the string "X-".  This
   document argues that, on balance, the "X-" convention has more costs
   than benefits.

Internet-Draft            X- Considered Harmful             October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Many application protocols use named parameters to represent data
   (for example, header fields in Internet mail messages and HTTP
   requests).  Historically, protocol designers and implementers have
   often differentiated between "standard" and "experimental" parameters
   by prefixing experimental parameters with the string "X-", where the
   "X" stands for "eXperimental".  This document argues that on balance
   the "X-" convention has more costs than benefits.


2.  Argument

   The "X-" convention has been in use for email header fields since the
   publication of [RFC822] in 1982, which distinguished between
   Extension-fields and user-defined-fields as follows:

      The prefatory string "X-" will never be used in the names of
      Extension-fields.  This provides user-defined fields with a
      protected set of names.

   That rule was restated by [RFC1154] as follows:

      Keywords beginning with "X-" are permanently reserved to
      implementation-specific use.  No standard registered encoding
      keyword will ever begin with "X-".

   This convention continued with various specifications for MIME
   [RFC2045] [RFC2046] [RFC2047], email [RFC2821] [RFC5321], HTTP
   [RFC2068] [RFC2616], and other technologies.

   The primary problem with the "X-" convention is that experimental or
   implementation-specific parameters have a tendency to become
   standardized (whether de jure or de facto), thus introducing the need
   for migration from the "X-" name to the standardized name.
   Migration, in turn, introduces interoperability issues because older
   implementations will support only the "X-" name and newer
   implementations might support only the standardized name.  To
   preserve interoperability, newer implementations simply support the
   "X-" name forever, which means that the experimental name becomes a
   de facto standard (thus obviating the need for segregation of the
   name spaces in the first place).  We can see this phenomenon at work
   in [RFC2068]:

      For compatibility with previous implementations of HTTP,
      applications should consider "x-gzip" and "x-compress" to be
      equivalent to "gzip" and "compress" respectively.

Internet-Draft            X- Considered Harmful             October 2010


   One of the original reasons for segregation of name spaces into
   standard and experimental areas was the perceived difficulty of
   registering names.  However, the solution to that problem has been
   simpler registration rules, such as those provided by [RFC3864] and
   [RFC4288], as well as separate registries for permanent and
   provisional names.  Indeed, [RFC4288] explicitly calls out the
   implications for experimental names:

      [W]ith the simplified registration procedures described above for
      vendor and personal trees, it should rarely, if ever, be necessary
      to use unregistered experimental types.  Therefore, use of both
      "x-" and "x." forms is discouraged.

   In some limited situations, segregating a name space can be
   justified; for example, when the names need to be very small (as in
   [RFC5646]) or when the names have significant meaning.  However, in
   general, segregating experimental or implementation-specific
   parameters into an "X-" ghetto has few if any benefits, and has at
   least one significant interoperability cost.  The practice is at best
   useless and at worst harmful.

   The primary objections to discarding the "X-" convention are:

   o  Implementers are easily confused.  However, implementers already
      are quite flexible about using both prefixed and non-prefixed
      names based on what works in the field, so the distinction between
      de facto names (e.g., "X-foo") and de jure names (e.g., "foo") is
      meaningless to them.

   o  Collisions are undesirable.  However, names are usually cheap, so
      an experimental or implementation-specific name of "foo" does not
      prevent a standards development organization from issuing a
      similarly creative name such as "bar".

   Therefore, this document recommends against the creation of new names
   with the special "X-" prefix in IETF protocols.


3.  Security Considerations

   Interoperability and migration issues with security-critical
   paramaters can result in unnecessary vulnerabilities.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for the IANA.
