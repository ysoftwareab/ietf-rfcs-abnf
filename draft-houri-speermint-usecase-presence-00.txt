Abstract

   The document describes several use cases for peering between two or
   more communities that provide real time communications services and
   presence and IM in particular.  The communities create a peering
   relationship between themselves thus enabling their users to
   collaborate with users on other communities.  The target of the
   document is to help understanding the requirements for peering
   between domains with regard to real time services

2.  Introduction

   Real Time Communications (RTC) services are becoming as prevalent and
   essential for users on the Internet as email.  While RTC services
   can, like email, be implemented directly by users in a point-to-point
   fashion, they are often provided for or on behalf of a community of
   users within an administrative domain.  As the use of these services
   grows, users increasingly have the need to communicate with users not
   only within their own community but with those in other communities
   as well.  In practice, each community is controlled by some
   authority, and so there is a need to provide for easier establishment
   of connectivity between communities, and the management of the inter-
   community link.  This document contains a set of user cases that
   describe how peering between communities may be used.  The use cases
   are intended to help in creating a set of requirements that will
   enable more secure and easier peering between communities that
   provide RTC services.

   This document will use the terminology as defined in [2] unless
   otherwise is stated.

   The following sections provide several use cases followed by a
   discussion on what these use cases may imply regarding the
   functionalities that need to be provided for in order to implement
   those use cases

3.  Use Cases

3.1.  Simple Interdomain Subscription

   Assume that we have two peer networks [2], peer network A and peer
   network B. User Alice@A.com wants to subscribe to user Bob@B.com and
   get his presence information.  In order to do so, Alice@A.com may
   connect directly to B.com and subscribe to Bob's presence
   information.  However, peer network B is not willing to support
   subscriptions from any user in the network and is willing only to
   support its users and users that are coming from other peer networks
   that peer network B trusts.

   In reality what will happen is that peer network A will connect to
   peer network B and will send Alice's subscription on Bob to peer
   network B. When peer network B has new information on Bob it will
   send notifications to peer network A that will pass them to Alice.

3.2.  List Interdomain Subscription

   This is the same as the simple interdomain subscription use case but
   in this case Alice subscribes to a URI that represents a list of
   users in peer network B [3]

3.3.  Page mode IM

   In this use case a user from one peer network sends a page mode [4]
   IM to a user on another peer network.  As with subscription, the
   message will pass between the users through the SBEs [2] of the peer
   networks.

3.4.  Session based IM

   In this use case a user from one peer network creates an MSRP [5]
   session with a user from another peer network.  The session
   establishment and the messages will pass between the users through
   the SBEs [2] of the peer networks.

3.5.  Other services

   In addition to media (voice/video) which are out of scope for this
   document only presence and IM are more or less fully standardized in
   real time communication.  However there are many other services that
   are being standardized or may be implemented using minimal extensions
   to existing standards.  These include:

   o  N-way chat - Enable a multi participant chat that will include
      users from many peer networs.

   o  File transfer - Send files from a user in one peer network to a
      user in another peer network.  Obviously this kind of operation
      will require appropriate security mechanisms.

   o  More to come...

3.6.  Federation

   Federation as defined in [2] is a use case also in real time
   communication.

   Multiple peer networks may federate in order to create a whole that
   is greater then its parts.  In a federation there is no need for one
   peer network to explicitly know about the other peer network that is
   a member in the federation.  It is enough for each peer network that
   is a member in the federation to connect to the federation and thus
   be able to communicate with other members of the federation.

   Additional services as security, lawful intercept and more may be
   provided to the peer networks that are members of the federation.

   Federation is also known as clearing house in the industry.

4.  Discussion

   The use cases described above may seem to be simple.  However, in
   reality it is not so.  The following describes issues that need to be
   solved in order to enable the creation of the use cases without the
   need to negotiate each peer network relationship separately and
   manually.

   o  Connectivity - A peer network needs a mechanism to learn the
      connectivity setting of the other peer network or of the
      federation.  Examples of connectivity parameters may be list of
      domains that the peer network is representing, firewall and NAT
      settings and more.

   o  Security - The peer network or the federation that is being
      connected to may require certain level of security in order to
      accept connections from another peer network.  For example, peer
      network B may require that only TL'S will be used and it can also
      specifies the type and level of certificates that should be used.
      Community A will need a way to discover and use these parameters.

   o  Privacy - In many peer networks that provide real time
      collaboration services there are inter mechanisms that enable a
      user to configure the level of privacy that they wish to achieve.
      for example, a user may say that only certain users will be able
      to see him/her etc.  Similar mechanisms are required to be in
      place in peering and especially in the federation model.

   o  Services - When two or more peer networks are peering for real
      time communication services, each peer network has to have an
      understanding regarding the services that are provided by the
      other peer network.  This may/should include: A) The list of
      services that are provided by the peer network or the federation.
      B) Parameters for each services that may be different between peer
      networks.  For example if the peer network provides for page mode
      IMs or session based IMs or both?  Is presence filtering is
      supported?

   o  Mappings - Many times one peer network may have different set of
      values for different statuses of a user.  For example "Do not
      Disturb" is translated to "Busy" in the other peer network.  Each
      peer network that peers with another peer network or with a
      federation, should have means for translating the values that may
      differ appropriately.

   o  Good Citizenship - presence and IM have many network and
      processing demands both form the point of view of number of
      messages and the point of view of processing time.  In order to

      enable peer networks connecting to each other without overloading
      each other, each peer network should be able to learn what is the
      expected behavior by the connected to peer network or federation
      and act accordingly.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses use cases for peering between communities.
   It is very clear that the protocols that will enable and make such
   peering easier will have significant security considerations, there
   are our of scope for a use case document.
