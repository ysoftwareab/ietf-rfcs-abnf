<p>The Information Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm, shifts the focus of networking from providing connections between hosts to efficiently providing content to the users. The work on ICN has traditionally been performed looking at "clean-slate" solutions which aims to replace IP with a new paradigm. On the other hand, in this memo we propose an "integration" approach to Information Centric Networking, i.e. we extend the IP protocol using a new IP Option (both for IPv4 and IPv6). The new IP option is used by routers to support networking based on content rather than (or better in addition to) end-point addresses. </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">In this memo we propose a new approach to Information Centric Networking <a href="#Koponen07">[Koponen07]</a><a href="#Jacobson09">[Jacobson09]</a>, based on extending the IP protocol by using a new IP Option called CONET IP option (defined both for IPv4 <a href="#RFC0791">[RFC0791]</a> and IPv6 <a href="#RFC2460">[RFC2460]</a>). The CONET IP option can be used by routers to support content aware networking, in addition to classical address based networking. The proposed solution has been described in <a href="#CONET11">[CONET11]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">The CONET IP option is used to identify the content which is the object of the data transfer. Its usage allows efficient in-network caching and replication of content.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">The architecture foresees End-Nodes, Serving Nodes and CONET nodes (see <a href="#architecture">Figure 1</a>). End-Nodes request for content. Serving Nodes provide content. CONET nodes: i) forward content requests from End-Nodes to Serving Nodes; ii) deliver content from Serving Nodes to End-Nodes; iii) may cache content and therefore provide it to End-Nodes without contacting the Serving Node. CONET nodes can be further classified in Border Nodes and Internal nodes. Border Nodes are able to perform both "forward-by-name" and caching, Internal nodes are not able to perform "forward-by-name" (but only plain IP routing) and can only perform caching.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">As shown in <a href="#architecture">Figure 1</a>, the CONET Information Centric Network can be seen as the inteconnection of CONET Sub Systems (CSSs). A CSS contains CONET nodes and exploits an under-CONET technology to transfer data among CONET nodes. A CSS could be: i) a couple of nodes interconnected by a point-to-point link, e.g. a PPP link or a UDP/IP overlay link; ii) a layer-2 network, e.g. Ethernet; iii) a layer-3 network, e.g. a private/public IPv4 or IPv6 network, or a whole IP Autonomous System, or even the whole current Internet.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">In addition to the new CONET IP option, the proposed solution needs a new Internet Protocol Number to identify the CONET protocol.  </p>

If the Cache indication field is set to "No Cache", the Intermediate Node forwards the packet using the destination IP address. If the Cache indication field is set to "Cache", the Intermediate Node checks the presence of the chunk in its cache before forwarding the IP packet.

The responding node will use the Path State information contained in the received carrier packet carrying the Interest CIU to forward back the carrier packets containing the named-data CIU towards the requesting end-node. In particular, it will use the pointer field to read the last address in the list and will use it as IP destination address for the Carrier packet carrying the named-data CIU. We can denote this address as "CONET previous hop". Then it will update the pointer field  so that the next node will use the previous address in the list. It may choose to strip the used address from the list in the CP Path state, thereby reducing the CP Path State field length.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.2.p.1">The Border Node will receive an IP packet directed to itself, whose IP protocol number is "CONET". Therefore the packet will be internally dispatched toward the "CONET entity" in the Border Node. The CONET entity reads the CONET information unit type from the CONET IP options and recognizes that the received packet is a named-data packet. Again, we stress that this processing should be performed in the fast path. Being a named-data packet, the Border Node will read the CP Path State field in the Carrier Packet and by using the pointer field will identify the CONET previous hop in the path towards the requesting end-node. Before sending out the packet, it will update the pointer field in the CP Path State field. The destination IP address of the packet will be set to the CONET previous hop retrieved from the CP Path State field. If the Cache indication bit in the IP option is set to "Cache", the Border Node may choose to cache the CIU that is transported by the carried packet. In this case, it is reccomended that the Border Node dispatches the packet as soon as possible and operates on a local copy to perform cache related operations.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.3.p.1">An Intermediate Node, i.e. a router in the path between a Serving Node or a Border Node and the CONET previous hop, which is aware of the CONET option, may decide to cache the named data CIU transported by a carrier packet. The Intermediate Node will receive an IP packet with an IP destination equal to the CONET previous hop and will immediately forward this packet using IP routing. Then, if the Cache indication bit in the IP option is set to "Cache", the Intermediate Node may choose to cache the CIU that is transported by the carried packet.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.4.p.1">When a packet is sent to the CONET previous hop (as selected by the Serving Node or by a Border Node) using the IP destination address of the previous hop obtained using the CP Path State information, it can cross different IP routers in the path from the sending node and the previous hop. If a crossed router is a legacy router not aware of the CONET IP option, it will simply forward the packet looking at the IP destination address. Note that a requirement for such legacy router is to be configured not to drop IP packets carrying unidentified IP options.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">The forward-by-name process is performed in the end-node and in Border Nodes in order to resolve a ICN-ID into the next hop towards a Serving Node for the given ICN-ID. This document provides a framework under which the forward-by-name procedures can be performed, and assures that different forward-by-name procedures and approaches may coexist. These different approaches needs to be separately specified. The format and the semantic of the ICN-ID may need to be specified when defining a specific forward-by-name approach. This is made possible by the concept of ICN-ID name space ID, which is carried within the ICN-ID.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">The basic procedure that a forward-by-name framework needs to offer is called resolveICN-ID, it takes as input the ICN-ID and returns the next_hop_address.

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.4">The tables on which the forward-by-name procedures are based are populated by Serving Nodes and by Border Nodes. The procedure is initiated by Serving Nodes that advertize the hosted content with the advertizeICN-ID procedure. In turn, the procedure is replicated by the Border Nodes that spread the received advertising toward other Border Nodes. This procedure takes as input a ICN-ID, the address of the node performing the procedure, and the path information towards the Serving Node as seen by the node performing the procedure. Depending on the specific content routing approach, the path information can be simply an hop count, or it could be the path list (as in the BGP AS-PATH).  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">In the VLL (Variable Length Label) CONET namespace the ICN-ID is simply the string representation of a resource.

An authority is needed to ensure the uniqueness of the ICN-IDs. The approach should be similar on how the uniqueness of DNS names is granted in today's Internet.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">In the Principal/Label Hash Based CONET namespace the ICN-ID is the composition of two hash values, as follows: </p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.p.5">In the Principal/Label Hash Based CONET namespace the Hash(principal) is a 8 bytes hash of a string representing the Principal. The Label is a 6 bytes hash of a string representing the label. A central authority is needed to ensure the uniqueness of the Hash(principal), i.e. a Principal cannot be assigned if its hash collides with an already assigned hash. The Principal is responsible to ensuring that each Hash(Label) belonging to the Principal are unique. Therefore a Label cannot be used by a Principal if its hash collides with the Hash of an already used Label.  </p>
