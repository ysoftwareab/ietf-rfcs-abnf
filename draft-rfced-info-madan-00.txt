1.0  Abstract

   The BOOTP [1] or the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [2]
   provide a framework for booting a host over a network from a remote
   server. This document defines a new option which a BOOTP/DHCP client
   may include in its BOOTP request or DHCPDISCOVER message. In their
   replies, the  recipient servers may include this option  along with
   the location/path information to a file ('boot.info') in the option
   field. The client may use the contents of this file to select the
   desired  OS  with which to boot along with the location/path of the
   appropriate boot image file.

2.0 Introduction

   BOOTP/DHCP Client and server may negotiate several possible options.
   RFC 1533 [3] provides the current list of these options. With the
   increasing popularity of NETWORK COMPUTERS, THIN CLIENTS and other
   diskless hosts, it is relevant to give such clients the capability
   of booting with a variety of OSs. The proposed option makes this
   feasible, without disturbing the present functionality of BOOTP
   or DCHP protocols.

   Throughout this document, the words that are used to define the
   significance of the particular requirements are capitalized.  These
   words are:

      MUST

           This word or the adjective "REQUIRED" means that the item is
           an absolute requirement of this specification.

      MUST NOT

           This phrase means the item is an absolute prohibition of this
           specification.

      SHOULD

           This word or the adjective "RECOMMENDED" means that there may
           exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore
           this item, but the full implications should be understood and
           the case carefully weighed before choosing a different
           course.

      SHOULD NOT

           This phrase means that there may exist valid reasons in
           particular circumstances when the listed behavior is
           acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should
           be understood and the case carefully weighted before
           implementing any behavior described with this label.

      MAY

           This word or the adjective "OPTIONAL" means that this item is
           truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item
           because a particular marketplace requires it or because it
           enhances the product, for example, another vendor may omit
           the same item.

   This document also uses the following terms:


      o "BOOTP/DHCP client"

           BOOTP/DHCP client or "client" is an Internet host using
           BOOTP or DHCP to obtain booting information and
           configuration parameters such as a network address.

      o "BOOTP/DHCP server"

           A BOOTP or DHCP server of "server"is an Internet host
           that returns booting information and

INTERNET DRAFT                                                 July 1997


           configuration parameters to DHCP clients.


3.0  Boot selection menu option

   The code for this option is TBD, and its minimum length is 2 bytes.

             Code     Len      n-byte long ASCII string
           +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--
           |  TBD  |   n   |       |       |       |       |
           +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--


4.0  BOOTP/DHCP client/server Behavior

    A BOOTP/DHCP client broadcasts a REQUEST/DHCPDISCOVER datagram.
    This datagram includes the new option in its option field:

             Code     Len
           +-------+-------+
           |  TBD  |   1   |
           +-------+-------+

    One or more servers will respond to this request. Servers MAY
    include this option in their responses. If a response contains
    this option, then the option part of this response data gram
    SHOULD look like as shown below:

             Code     Len      n-byte long ASCII string
           +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--
           |  TBD  |   n   |       |       |       |       |
           +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--

    The client SHOULD interpret the n-byte long ASCII string as follows:

              'filename:OS1:OS2:...OSk'

    where,':' is used as a parsing de-limilter and OS1, OS2,..., OSk
    are the accepted names of the OSs that this server can offer.
    It is however, not mendatory to include the list of OSs. The purpose
    of this that it MAY be used by a DHCP client as an additional
    criterion for making a decision about choosing a particular DHCP
    server. On the server side, the file 'filename' MUST contain boot
    menu information as explained in the next paragraph.

         In case of the DHCP, client evaluates various responses offered
    by the DHCP servers and selects a particular server. As explained
    in the previous paragraph, this evaluation MAY now include an
    additional criterion, viz. the list of OSs being offered. In case
    of the BOOTP, there is deemed to be only one server. Therefore,
    BOOTP clients MAY ignore the OSs list. A client SHOULD next retrieve
    the file 'filename' using the TFTP. This file SHOULD contain tuples
    of information. Each of these tuples SHOULD be of the type:

                   <OS name, boot file image name/location>

    For simplifying the parsing of this file, these tuples SHOULD
    appear on a separate lines.

         After receiving this file, a client SHOULD display a
    boot-manager like menu using the OS name field of these tuples.
    Client SHOULD now make a choice within, say, 5-secs. Based on this



Madan          draft-ietf-boot/dhcp-select-boot-00.txt              [Page 3]


    choice, the client MUST next retrieve the associated boot image
    file using the TFTP. In case client user does not make a choice
    within this time interval, client MAY behave as if this new option
    does not exist.


5.0  Security Considerations

   DHCP currently provides no authentication or security mechanisms.
   Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7 of the DHCP
   protocol specification [1].
