             Network Architecture with Recursive Addressing
                          draft-dykim-nara-02

Abstract

   A network architecture based on recursive addressing is proposed.
   The Internet is modeled as a network of autonomous sites, each being
   a collection of nodes.  Each site is named by a exterior address
   whereas each node by a interior local address.  Exterior routing
   depends solely on site addresses while interior routing on node
   addresses.  Both interior and exterior routings render inherent
   mobility as well as seamless multihoming capability.  The model can
   recursively repeat itself both outwards and inwards in the network,
   enabling its applicability, for example, to inter-planetary as well
   as Internet of Things.

1.  Introduction

   Scalability of the Internet has long been recognized as one of its
   major problems.  Explosion of DFZ(Default Free Zone) routing tables,
   one aspect of the problem, has resulted from the Internet's inability
   of efficient multi-homing, for which semantic overloading of the IP
   address has been blamed.  This semantic overloading, that IP
   addresses are used as both the identifiers(IDs) and the
   Locators(Locs) for nodes, has also been perceived as against the
   naming and addressing principles[IEN0001][IEN0019][RFC1498] and so as
   the main obstacle hindering the Internet from providing fast mobility
   and seamless multihoming.

   A considerable number of protocols based on the Loc/ID
   Separation(LIS) architecture have been proposed.  Some of them are

   host-based[RFC4423][GSE][ILNP][IEEE-MCOM]while others are router-
   based[LISP][IRON][Ivip].

   This document proposes an architecture, named NARA, based on local
   addressing in its strict sense.  Local addresses, for nodes, are
   never exploited in exterior routing.  A collection of nodes under an
   autonomous administration is called a site, and only site addresses
   identifying them are used in exterior routing.

   NARA is very close to the ideas proposed in ENCAPS and
   hIPv4[RFC1955][RFC6306].  The addresses of the latter two, however,
   name interfaces whereas NARA's addresses name node themselves.

   Node addresses in NARA are semantically overloaded.  They are used
   for end-to-end connections as well as for routing.  This is a stark
   contrast to prevalent arguments of LIS.  Semantic overloading is not
   seen as an evil in NARA, but is rather positively exploited to
   provide fast mobility and seamless multihoming.

   Although this document describes NARA in two-tier networks, the same
   addressing and routing principles can be recursively repeated inwards
   and outwards off a given network tier.  NARA is a recursive network
   architecture.

   Following sections provide a generic description of the NARA
   architecture and associated routings.  Implemetation choices for a
   better chance of deployability are then discussed in the ensuing
   section.  Consequences of the proposal are discussed before
   concluding the document.

2.  ARCHITECTURE

   The Internet is modeled as a networked collection of autonomous
   sites.  A site is a collection of nodes, also called either
   hosts(stub nodes) or routers(relay nodes).  A subset of hosts and an
   associated router form a subnet.  Therefore, a site can also be
   considered as a networked collection of subnets.  A site itself can
   be a stub or a (transit) relay.

   The Internet at one instance of the hierarchy is therefore governed
   by the two-tier administration, i.e., the exterior authority and the
   interior(local) authorities.

   A node is named by an address local to a given site.  A subset of
   nodes and an associated router form a subnet.  Being associated with
   a router, each subnet can be identified by the router address.
   Therefore, the subnet address and the router address can be used
   interchangeably.

   A site is bordered by a gateway router, G in Fig. 1.  The gateway
   assumes the address which is valid in the exterior tier.  Since each
   site is associated with a gateway, a site is identified by the
   gateway address.  Therefore, the site address and the gateway address
   can be used interchangeably.

   One of the important functions of the gateway is to change addresses
   of packets at their passing in either direction.  There might be two
   ways to accomplish this address change.  One way is address swapping.
   That is, when a packet leaves a site, its source address is swapped
   to the site address.  When entering a domain, the destination of the
   packet address which is essentially the site address is swapped back
   to a local(interior) address of the target node inside the site.  In
   this scenario, a gateway is essentially a NAT(Network Address/Port
   Translator) router.

Internet-Draft                    NARA                     December 2013


   Another way of address change is encapsulation.  The outgoing packet
   is encapsulated within an outer packet header of which the source
   address is the egress gateway address.  In entering the destination
   site, the outer header is stripped off and the packet is routed
   inside by use of the interior(local) address of the target node which
   is preserved in the inner header.

   Exterior routing is done solely on site addresses while interior
   routing on node addresses.  Node addresses are never exposed to
   exterior routing.  This way, the routing table in a tier can be
   maintained to a manageable size.

   In addition to routing, node addresses are also associated with
   transport connections.  In this sense, it can be said that node
   addresses are semantically overloaded.  In NARA, semantic overloading
   of addresses is not considered harmful; it is rather natural and even
   desirable.

   It is assumed that two peer sites use the same addressing scheme.
   Otherwise, meaningful connection cannot normally be established,
   although some complicated measures like address translation might
   provide a detour.  In contrast, the outer tier does not have to
   conform with the same addressing scheme as the interior sites.

   Normally, neither node- nor site-addresses bear topological
   significance; they each consume separate flat number spaces.  Node
   addresses don't change while nodes are moving around within a site.
   Site addresses don't change at migration across upstream network
   providers as well as at multi-homing.

   In a rare case of implementation instances, site addresses might bear
   topological significance as with the current Internet.  In this case,
   only the site address would change at migration to a different
   network provider.  At multi-homing in this case, a site can be given
   multiple site addresses from different upstream network providers.

   The FQDN(Fully Qualified Domain Name) of a node would be resloved
   first to a site address by the exterior name server.  An interior
   name server then resolves the rest to a local node address.

   A node in a given site can be a site by itesef.  That is, the node
   can be marked by a gateway and contain children nodes inside.  This
   way, the same network architecture can recur as needed.

3.  INTERIOR ROUTING

   Packets in a site are routed solely on node addresses.  Link-state
   protocols like ISIS is recommended for interior routing.

   In addition to usual routing and forwarding tables, each router also
   maintains a node membership table of {target node, associated target
   router} tuples.  See Fig. 2.  When a node moves from one subnet to
   another, such a membership change is immediately broadcast by the
   previous and/or newly visited subnet router to all other routers in
   the site, resulting in membership table update.  In this way, host
   mobility is provided directly by routers.

   Moving of a subnet is the same as moving of the associated router,
   and such a move will be perceived as a topological change of the
   network and so will be reflected in the routing tables at link-state
   updates.  Henceforth, (subnet) network mobility is provided also as
   an inherent feature of the routing.

   In host mobility, frequent membership change may result in broadcast
   storms.  In order to reduce the number of such storms, only the
   router of the newly visited subnet may be allowed to broadcast the
   member addtion to other routers, effetively halfening the total
   broadcast packets.  In this case, a false alarm broadcast could be an
   issue, which, however, would be mitigated by an appropriate separate
   security measure.

4.  EXTERIOR ROUTING

   Packets in the exterior tier are routed solely on site addresses.
   Interior node addresses are not advertised into the exterior tier.

   In the sense of the network graph, each transit site can be
   considered to correspond to a router(relay node) within a site
   whereas a stub site to a host(stub node).  That is, symmetry of
   network architecture repeats itself at each tier.  Therefore, the
   same routing features of interior routing can also be applied to
   exterior routing with tranist sites and stub sites in place of
   routers and hosts, respectively.

5.  IMPLEMENTATION CHOICES

   Although the proposed network architecture of NARA is described in a
   generic way, it can be tailored for smooth and incremental deployment
   in the existing Internet.

5.1.  Node Address

   In principle, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be used for local node
   addresses.  However, since the range of IPv4 private addresses might
   be enough for most sites, use of IPv4 addresses might be more
   appealing.

Internet-Draft                    NARA                     December 2013


   The IPv4 addresses do not have to be private addresses, since the
   node addresses are not advertized to the exterior tier.  Use of
   already acquired IPv4 addresses ensures minimal changes to existing
   vast population of IPv4 hosts.  Transition to IPv6 addresses will not
   be a requisite anymore, but a luxurious option at most.

   It is to be noted that IP addresses adopted as such do not name
   interfaces anymore; they name nodes themselves.  That is, although IP
   addresses will continue to be used, their context will be changed.

5.2.  Site Address

   The routing prefix of a given site, i.e., the aggragate address of
   the whole PA(provider-aggregatable) addresses already assigned to the
   site, can be used as the site address.

5.3.  Gateway

   An important funtion of the gateway is to change addresses of packets
   passing throught it.  A gateway can be either a NAT router or a
   tunnel router, depending on the adopted scheme of address change.

5.4.  Name Servers

   DNS working in a strictly hiearchical manner would serve the purpose
   of the name servers of NARA.  The FQDN(Fully Qualified Domain Name)
   of a node would be resloved first to a site address by a global name
   server.  A local name server then resolves the rest to a local node
   address.

5.5.  Routing Protocols

   OSPF or ISIS can be used for interior routing.  A difference is that
   IP addresses (as node addresses) now points to nodes instead of
   interfaces.  Changes to OSPF coding should be minimal.  ISIS might be
   preferable since it inherently deals with node addresses.

   Although other protocols, in principle, could also be used for
   exterior routing, BGP4 with PA addresses might be the immediate
   option not much to disturb the current operation of the Internet.

6.  CONSEQUENCES

6.1.  Recursive Internet

   In NARA, the network architectures of the interior and the exterior
   tiers are symmetric, basically the same.  Therefore, the same generic
   architecture can be repeated without bound outwards as well as
   inwards.  For example, in the design of an inter-planetary Internet,
   the same architecture can be placed on top of the global Internet.
   Also, in accommodating IoT (Internet of Things) edge networks which
   by themselves may each consist of a huge number of internal nodes,
   repetition of the same architecture might significantly reduce the
   complexity of the whole-scale networking.

   The Internet modeled as with NARA can be asserted to be scalable and
   expandable without bound.

6.2.  No Address Depletion

   Since the global Internet is split into tiers of manageable size,
   there'd be no danger of address depletion.  The 32-bit length for
   node addresses will be more than enough for most sites' need.  The
   same should be true of the site prefixes.  In fact, migration to IPv6
   is not a requirement anymore, but merely a luxurious option.

6.3.  No Inadvertent Internet Governance

   Since sites don't have to buy node address spaces from any
   authorities, the impact of the Internet governance will reduce only
   to a minimal necessity.

6.4.  Fast Mobility

   Host mobility inside a site is provided as default.  Transport
   connections are associated with node addresses which don't change
   while nodes are moving inside a given site.  Transport connections
   don't break at interior host mobility.  Since such mobility is
   directly provided by link-state routing, with periodic link-state
   updates augmented by immediate event-driven broadcasts, host mobility
   is as fast as the frequency and speed of broadcast packet
   propagation.

   Network(subnet) mobility is also provided as an inherent feature of
   the interior routing.  Renumbering of mobile subnets is not necessary
   since each subnet is identified by the associated router address
   which, being itself a node address, does not change inside a given
   site.

6.5.  Site Multi-homing and Migration

   Site addresses don't change at migration to new upstream transit
   sites.

   Site multi-homing with flat address is not a problem, either.  The
   same site address of a multi-homed site will simply be seen
   simultaneously in gateway routing tables of involved upstream transit
   sites.

6.6.  Host Multi-homing

   Host multi-homing can also be supported.  If a host is multi-homed on
   multiple sites, there'd be multiple return site addresses for the
   same name from the name server.  Transport connections through
   different sites would be considered as different ones.  If there's
   need to converge these multiple connections to be presented as a
   single virtual transport connection to a given application, a sort of
   session management function might be exploited on top of the
   transport layer as is done with MPTCP[RFC6182].

6.7.  Traffic Engineering

   Gateways of a multi-homed site can control inbound traffic according
   to the remote site addresses.  Interior routers can also choose exit
   gateways in accordance with target site addresses.

   If traffic engineering in the granularity of a node is desired, a
   node may inform the subnet routers of its preferred site address of a
   given remote multi-homed site.  The same can be done for preference
   about the exiting gateway.

6.8.  No Renumbering

   Since node addresses are local, no renumbering of nodes is necessary
   at domain migration or multi-homing.

6.9.  Semantic Overloading

   The current proposal implicitly suggests that semantic overloading of
   an address may not be seen as a fatal problem to a network
   architecture.  The addresses, of nodes and sites, are used both for
   identification and routing in NARA.  This contextual malleability of
   addresses is seen as rather a virtue than an evil.  It can also be
   argued that whatever separation one might engineer, semantic
   overloading would inevitably result one way or another and so should
   rather be received as a natural phenomenon of networking.

   A network architecture based on local and recursive addressing is
   introduced.  The Internet is seen as a collection of sites, each
   being itself a collection of nodes.  Addresses local to a given site
   name nodes whereas exterior addresses do sites.  Mobility, of both
   hosts and subnets, is seamless because it is provided directly by
   routers as one of their inherent operational features.  Frozen site-
   as well as node-addresses guarantee seamless domain migration and
   multi-homing with no need of renumbering.  Address depletion is not
   an issue anymore and the Internet governance reduces to a minimal
   necessity.  The proposed network model can repeat itself outwards as
   well as inwards, enabling its applicability to inter-plenary Internet
   as well as to Internet of Things.
