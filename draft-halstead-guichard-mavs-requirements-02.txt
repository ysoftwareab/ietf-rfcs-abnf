Abstract 

   This document complements [RFC-4031] and defines requirements that 
   are specific to the delivery of BGP/MPLS-based [RFC-4364] VPN 
   services across multiple administrative domains. These requirements 
   are independent of underlying technologies or the number of 
   Autonomous Systems such VPNs may span. It lists the requirements of 
   the different parties that are involved in the administration of 
   these Autonomous Systems and may therefore be involved in the 
   delivery of the VPN service offerings.  

Conventions used in this document  

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

1. Introduction 

   This document summarizes requirements that apply to all parties 
   involved in the delivery of BGP/MPLS-based [RFC-4364] VPN services 
   that span multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes). Such parties include, 
   but are not limited to, Network Service Providers (NSP), Systems 
   Integrators (SI), Network Integrators (NI), Cable Operators (CO), 
   Mobile Operators (MO) and Virtual Network Operators (VNO). This 
   document further specifies which current IETF working groups could 
   host the work items that address some or potentially all of the 
   identified requirements.  

   BGP/MPLS-based [RFC-4364] VPN services may be delivered between ASes 
   of the same company (commonly referred to as ''Inter-AS'' services), 
   or different companies (commonly referred to as ''Inter-provider'' 
   services). This document aims to provide requirements for either 
   type of service delivery. 

   BGP/MPLS-based [RFC-4364] VPN services are deployed and operated due 
   to the combined activation of a set of elementary capabilities. This 
   document is organized to take the requirements for activating these 
   capabilities across multiple ASes into account using the following 
   taxonomy: 

   - Topological considerations: These correspond to the information 
      needed for the deployment of BGP/MPLS-based [RFC-4364] VPN 
      topologies. This information includes, but is not limited to, 
      identification of the endpoints that will be interconnected via 
      the VPN, forwarding and routing policies to be enforced by the 
      VPN network elements, and the topology of VPN membership. 

   - QoS considerations: These correspond to the information, with QoS 
      parameters, that may characterize the level of quality provided 
      with the VPN service offering. QoS parameters include, but are 
      not limited to, VPN traffic classification and marking 
      capabilities, traffic conditioning and scheduling capabilities, 
      as well as VPN traffic engineering capabilities.

Internet-Draft draft-halstead-guichard-mavs-requirements-02    May 2006 
    

   - Security considerations: Any BGP/MPLS-based [RFC-4364] VPN that 
      is deployed and operated across multiple ASes may require the 
      need for identification, authentication and potentially, VPN 
      traffic encryption capabilities. This includes the possible 
      identification and authentication of the resources that 
      participate in the establishment and operation of a VPN, as well 
      as the ability to check the integrity of VPN route announcements 
      exchanged between ASes. 

   - Management considerations: It is assumed that the operation of 
      QoS-based BGP/MPLS-based [RFC-4364] VPN services is part of the 
      management tasks performed by service providers within their own 
      ASes. Additional operational tasks are however needed in order to 
      enable the management of VPN services across multiple ASes. 

   - Measurement and monitoring considerations: the ability to measure 
      and monitor service delivery is of paramount importance, 
      especially when such services span multiple ASes. 

   This document is therefore organized as follows:  

   - Section 2 is a gap analysis summary listed by IETF working group. 
      The purpose of this section is to summarize all requirements 
      identified in this document by each working group, with a 
      reference to the section that describes the requirement in full.  

   - Section 3 defines terminology specific to the delivery of 
      BGP/MPLS-based [RFC-4364] VPN services that span multiple ASes. 
      This terminology aims at facilitating the overall understanding 
      of the issues and requirements expressed in this document. 

   - Section 4 describes some of the drivers for the deployment of 
      Multi-AS BGP/MPLS-based [RFC-4364] VPN services.  

   - Section 5 introduces a reference model that depicts the context 
      for the deployment and the operation of BGP/MPLS-based [RFC-4364] 
      VPN service offerings that span multiple ASes. In addition, use 
      cases illustrate examples of different business and operational 
      process interaction between the various parties.  

   - Section 6 describes topological requirements that include traffic 
      forwarding and routing considerations, VPN traffic load balancing 
      capabilities, as well as VPN Peering Location-specific 
      interconnect design considerations.

   - Section 7 describes VPN-specific Multi-AS QoS policy enforcement 
      requirements which include forwarding, routing and measurement 
      considerations. 

   - Section 8 describes VPN-specific Multi-AS security policy 
      enforcement requirements which include identification, 
      authentication and encryption considerations. 

   - Section 9 describes VPN-specific Multi-AS management policy 
      enforcement requirements which include configuration, fault 
      detection, performance and accounting management tasks. 

   Sections 6 through 9 include a "gap analysis" sub-section, the 
   purpose of which is to better elaborate on the pending specification 
   work which could solicit the IETF community to discuss whether such 
   gaps could be addressed by the identified working groups.

3. Definitions 

   Some of the terminology used in this document is taken from [RFC-
   4026] and [RFC-4031]. ''VPN'' in the context of this document refers 
   specifically to BGP/MPLS-based [RFC-4364] VPN services. In order to 
   clarify the requirements listed in this document, it is necessary to 
   further define and introduce new terminology, specific to multi 
   provider VPN services as follows:  

3.1. Multi Domain Environment (MDE)  

   Two or more Autonomous Systems that may or may not be owned by 
   separate administrative authorities, and which are used to 
   interconnect service endpoints (sites) of one or more VPNs. 

3.2. VPN Service Provider (VSP)  

   A VSP is an operator who participates in the delivery of a single 
   domain, or multi-domain (MDE-wide) VPN service. In delivering the 
   VPN service, the VSP may own a subset, or all of the participating 
   network elements. Examples of VSPs include Network Service Providers 
   (NSP), Systems Integrators (SI), Network Integrator (NI), Cable 
   Operator (CO), Mobile Operator (MO) and Virtual Network Operators 
   (VNO).  

3.3. VPN Peering Location (VPL)  

   A VPL is a physical location where VPN services delivered by one or 
   more VSPs are interconnected. Examples of VPLs include a network 
   operator hotel, SP central offices, a collocation facility or any 
   building common to one or more VSPs. A VPL could be operated by a 
   single VSP, consortium of VSPs or a neutral 3rd-party. 

3.4. Agent  

   For the purposes of this document, an Agent is a VSP who is 
   responsible for the management of multi-party business processes, 
   negotiations and fulfillment that allow the multi-provider VPN to 
   function. The Agent manages this responsibility by either 
   operationally complying with or coordinating policies across all 
   parties involved in delivering their customer's end-to-end service. 
   Policy compliance or multi-party policy coordination is achieved 
   either in a distributed or centralized manner.

Internet-Draft draft-halstead-guichard-mavs-requirements-02    May 2006 
    

   For distributed policy enforcement, cooperating VSPs agree upon the 
   enforcement of consistent policies for VPN service provisioning 
   purposes. In this case, end-to-end policy enforcement is distributed 
   across multiple VSPs, each of which is a stakeholder in the supply 
   and enforcement of a fixed set of policies within the shared MDE. A 
   VPN customer defines their VPN service requirements with an Agent 
   who then maps these requirements to the set of pre-agreed policies.  

   For centralized policy enforcement, the Agent coordinates per 
   customer, a set of policies related to the management of the 
   customer's VPN service. In contrast to a shared MDE where policy 
   enforcement is distributed across multiple VSPs, this Agent will 
   coordinate policies and integrate VPN services per customer, thereby 
   creating a MDE that is dedicated to the Agent's customers only. The 
   Agent may independently agree and manage SLSs with each partner VSP 
   and offer an aggregated end-to-end SLS to their customer's. 

4. Problem Statement 

   No single network can deliver VPN services that provide optimal 
   price and performance for all customers and all customer locations. 
   For regulatory, commercial, resiliency and other reasons, customer 
   requirements for VPN services may not be compatible with a single 
   VSP owned network infrastructure. 

   Alternatively, some customers may have requirements for VPNs that 
   are difficult and/or expensive for a single VSP to deliver. In this 
   case the VSP has incentives to cooperate with other VSPs that may 
   offer similar VPN services, along with broadly compatible SLSs. 

   For customers (whether they solicit an Agent or not), end-to-end VPN 
   service delivery is paramount. Controllable, predictable and 
   reliable VPN service must be delivered regardless of the 
   characteristics of the MDE. The challenge however for the Agent in 
   controlling 'global' service policy in an MDE is the lack of 
   homogenous policies amongst VSPs and the difficulty VSPs have in 
   adapting their VPN service domains to the customer's Agent-defined 
   VPN service policy.

5. Multi Domain Environment Reference Model 

   Figure 1 shows a generic reference model for a Multi Domain 
   Environment. It shows the relationships that exist between the 
   various parties involved in the establishment of VPN services that 
   span multiple VSP-administered networks.

            |  |         VSP1       VPL1     VSP2          |  | 
            |  |          ^          ^         ^           |  | 
            | 1..n       1..n      1..n       1..n       1..n | 
            |  V          V          V         V           V  | 
            |Site1 <---> AS1<---> (VPL1) <---> AS2 <---> Site2| 
    
                       Figure 1 MDE Reference Model 

   The MDE consists of sites, interconnected via ASes. ASes are then 
   interconnected via VPLs, within the context of delivering VPN 
   service offerings. There is potentially a one-to-many relationship 
   between VSPs and ASes, similarly there is potentially a one-to-many 
   relationship between VPL operators and VPLs. Note that VSPs may be 
   remotely interconnected, that is, VSPs do not necessarily need to be 
   directly connected to each other through a given VPL, as elaborated 
   in section 6.1.    

   With reference to Figure 1, the following sections detail examples 
   of the coordination of the various parties in the enforcement of a 
   set of policies. These policies relate to the provisioning of an 
   MDE-wide VPN service and include (but are not limited to) 
   addressing, routing, QoS and security.

5.1. Distributed Policy Enforcement Example 

   The customer's Agent is a single VSP (VSP1 in this example). VSP1 
   manages the relationship with the customer, which includes the 
   specification, instantiation, possible negotiation and invocation of 
   the customer's SLS (Service Level Specification). Cooperating VSPs, 
   VSP1 and VSP2 have pre-agreed an enforced set of policies, including 
   the management of VPL1. The customer's requirements are mapped by 
   VSP1 to the pre-agreed policies of VSP1 and VSP2.  

5.2. Centralized Policy Enforcement Example 

   The customer's Agent is a Systems Integrator (SI). The SI does not 
   own the network infrastructure (the VPN networking elements), but 
   manages the VPLs, as well as the processes involved in connecting 
   the VPLs with each relevant VSP owned AS. VSP1 and VSP2 
   independently provide customer-specific VPN services and associated 
   SLS instantiated templates to the SI who is then responsible for 
   integrating each VSP's VPN service components and 
   negotiating/invoking an end-to-end SLS with/for their customer.  

6. Topological Requirements 

6.1. Remote Service Interconnect Requirement 

   In an MDE, Agent(s) will select VSPs according to the needs of their 
   customer. VSP owned ASes may or may not be collocated at the same 
   VPL. For those ASes that are collocated at the same VPL, 
   interconnection of VPN services can take place locally. However, in 
   the example of an end-to-end chain of three VSP owned ASes and two 
   VPLs, local VPN interconnection will happen twice; once at the first 
   VPL (first to second AS) and once at the second (second to third 
   AS). Nevertheless, in some situations, the Agent may choose not to 
   use the VPN service of the second (middle) VSP. Instead, the Agent 
   may wish to interconnect the VPN services of the first and third 
   VSPs remotely. There is, therefore, an Agent-driven requirement to 
   be able to remotely interconnect services of non-collocated VSP 
   owned ASes in an MDE.

6.2. Optimal Interconnect Selection Requirement 

   VSP multi-homing is the scenario in which a VSP needs to 
   interconnect their AS at two or more VPLs. By ensuring that traffic 
   passes between ASes at pre-determined VPLs, the desired end-to-end 
   VPN service delivery can be established and retained for any 
   customer sites. VSP networks can therefore be utilized more 
   efficiently.  

   As an example, consider a customer site in the middle of the USA. It 
   is connected to a VSP's AS that is interconnected at VPLs in both 
   New York and Los Angeles. In order to minimize latency, traffic must 
   be sent to Tokyo via the LA VPL and not via New York. From a network 
   utilization perspective, routing Tokyo-bound traffic via New York 
   incurs an inefficient, resource-consuming round trip traversal of 
   the USA. Similarly, the same site might also send traffic to London. 
   The optimal route for this traffic will be via New York rather than 
   LA.  

   Although this scenario may be taken care of by standard IP routing, 
   the specifics of a VSPs BGP routing policy, or traffic engineering 
   implementation, may force some traffic to be forwarded away from the 
   best path. Nevertheless, the notion of optimality should not 
   necessarily be expressed in terms of hop count metrics. The 
   selection of the optimal interconnecting points should rely upon a 
   variety of criteria that include (but are not necessarily limited 
   to): 

   - The minimum number of hops that need to be crossed to reach a 
      given (set of) VPN destination(s). Note that AS hops can be 
      misleading. VSPs may implement multiple BGP ASes on one or many 
      IGPs, 

   - The minimum value of the one-way transit delay to reach a given 
      (set of) VPN destination(s). Note that the minimum hops and one-
      way transit delay may be in conflict, 

   - The minimum value of the inter-packet delay variation to reach a 
      given (set of) VPN destination(s), 

   - The minimum value of the packet loss rate to reach a given (set 
      of) VPN destination(s), 

   - The preservation of the confidentiality of the traffic that may 
      be exchanged between a given set of VPN locations,

Internet-Draft draft-halstead-guichard-mavs-requirements-02    May 2006 
    

   - The maximum VPN prefix length that should be announced at VPL 
      locations, 

   - The use of VPL locations that should not share network resources 
      involved in the forwarding of Internet traffic, 

   - The required traffic symmetry to allow a given source-destination 
      pair to be forwarded on the same path in both directions so as to 
      avoid packet mis-ordering, 

   - The available bandwidth capacity at the VPL (in the case where 
      overbooking policies are in effect at the VPL), 

   - Political considerations e.g. a given country may not allow 
      routing or traffic through their geography, 

   - Geopolitical instability e.g. a VSP should have a stability 
      rating as a selection criteria, 

   - Availability and reliability of a given VSP, 

   - Any combination of the above criteria. 

   Therefore, for multi-homed ASes, there is an Agent-driven 
   requirement for interconnects at multiple VPLs to be optimally 
   selectable for each source-destination site pair within an MDE. 

6.3. Redundant Interconnect Requirement 

   Part of the end-to-end VPN service offering provided by one or more 
   Agents involves the provision of appropriate levels of redundancy 
   for their MDE use case. In some VPLs, where business justifications 
   exist, Agents or VSPs may choose to enhance interconnect reliability 
   by implementing a redundant interconnect complex.  

   The resulting interconnects might exist in the same building or in 
   different buildings within a city or in different buildings in 
   different cities. This is in addition to the Optimal Interconnect 
   Selection requirement in that a customer service will be designed to 
   traverse each redundant interconnect, rather than a specific, 
   optimal interconnect.  

   There is therefore an Agent or VSP driven requirement to support 
   customer services across redundant interconnects.

6.4. VPN Topology Requirement 

   Although VSP owned ASes offer the possibility for any customer site 
   to communicate with any other customer site, in certain situations 
   this is not desirable. There are many possible reasons why a 
   customer might want to restrict communication amongst sites so that 
   their end- to-end service becomes segmented. For instance, it may be 
   that security is a concern or it may be that customer sites or 
   divisions must only use connectivity they have paid for. 
   Furthermore, the traffic flows associated with specific applications 
   may require a partial topology specifically sized to accommodate the 
   aggregate traffic flows.  

   The segmentation might need to exist on a geographical basis, 
   region- by-region and country-by country. Alternatively, 
   segmentation might need to exist on a corporate basis, division-by-
   division or site-by-site. Segmentation might even exist within 
   customer sites. However, today, there are no standards for or 
   agreement of how VPN topologies are constructed amongst VSPs. 
   Consequently, VSPs use different methods for establishing the 
   logical topology of a VPN and use different schemas to define VPN 
   membership.  

   For instance, one VSP might use standard community values to 
   establish layer-2 topologies whilst another might use extended 
   community values. Yet another VSP may use a combination of both 
   techniques. Alternatively, VSPs may segment VPNs using layer-3 
   routing techniques. In fact, some VSPs might combine layer-2 and 
   layer-3 segmentation techniques.  

   Additionally, each VSP will implement a schema for VPN membership 
   that is proprietary, with membership values that are likely to 
   overlap and conflict with other VSP assigned values. VPN membership 
   allocation schemas tend to be difficult to modify due to the 'hard 
   coding' of the schema in each network operator's OSS and BSS 
   systems.  

   Conflicting VPN membership schemas and different methods for 
   establishing logical topologies make it very difficult for the Agent 
   to establish an end-to-end VPN service. Moreover, an inventory of 
   the topology consisting of the network elements/interfaces and set 
   of paths that traffic may take through the network could in addition 
   be difficult for the VSP to make available to the Agent.  


 
 
                      Expires November 8, 2006               [Page 15] 

Internet-Draft draft-halstead-guichard-mavs-requirements-02    May 2006 
    

   These elements will most likely constitute a partial topological 
   view of the network but may be sufficient and required for the 
   purpose of QoS policy definition.  

   There is therefore, a requirement to be able to establish an end-to-
   end VPN topology, with assigned VPN-ID, including the publishing of 
   network elements and interface inventories per VSP throughout an 
   MDE. 

6.5. End-to-end Unicast and Multicast Routing Requirements 

6.5.1. Generic Routing Considerations 

   Routing and forwarding configuration information deals with the 
   decision criteria that should be taken by a network element in order 
   to forward VPN specific traffic according to a given VPN routing 
   policy. From this perspective, VSP owned network elements should be 
   provided as a minimum with the following information:  

   - Relevant metric information so that network elements can 
      dynamically assign these metric values. Such metric values could 
      be assigned on either long or (very) short-term basis. Examples 
      of assigned 'long-term' metrics include packet loss and delay 
      thresholds, usually expressed as percentiles of available 
      resources. Short-term metrics may include available or reserved 
      bandwidth, typically provided via real-time or near real-time 
      SNMP MIB queries. Furthermore, these metrics may be advertised as 
      transitive or non-transitive. 

   - The configuration information related to any static route that 
      may identify a VPN endpoint (or VPL) as the next hop to reach a 
      given VPN destination prefix. 

6.5.2. IGP Routing Considerations 

   Today there are no standards for, or agreement of, how VPN routing 
   policy based upon the policing of the admission and distribution of 
   VPN routing information (classification and filtering of routing 
   information) is implemented amongst VSPs.  

   Consequently, VSPs enforce VPN routing policies within a defined 
   customer topology in different ways. For example, in an MDE, where 
   the EF-inferred IGP policy [RFC-2676] of AS1 relies upon the 
   computation of routes with a maximum one-way transit delay of 120 ms 
   in order to reach a set of destination prefixes, and AS2 defines the 
   equivalent EF (Expedited Forwarding)-inferred IGP policy with a 
   different QoS parameter (e.g. maxLossRate=0%), then there is a risk 
 
 
                      Expires November 8, 2006               [Page 16] 

Internet-Draft draft-halstead-guichard-mavs-requirements-02    May 2006 
    

   of jeopardizing the overall quality of service of the multi-AS VPN. 
   Conflicting routing policies amongst VSPs therefore make it 
   difficult to establish an end-to-end unicast routing policy 
   throughout an MDE.  

   There is, therefore, a requirement to be able to enforce a 
   consistent IGP routing policy throughout an MDE. 

6.5.3. BGP Routing Considerations 

   VSP owned network elements should be provided with relevant BGP-4 
   [RFC-4271] reachability information, including the attributes taken 
   into account by the network element's route selection process in 
   order to decide whether or not traffic should be forwarded along a 
   given VPN route. 

     6.5.3.1. BGP AS_PATH Attribute Considerations 

   Where BGP-4 is used as the PE-CE routing protocol, the use of a 
   single private [RFC-1930] AS Number (ASN) across all customer sites 
   hosted by multiple VSPs could raise issues for each VSP as they 
   commonly use the 'as-override' command on PE-CE neighbors.  

   Where VPN-IPv4 routes are advertised across multiple ASes, VSP owned 
   public Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) could be pre-pended to 
   private route updates. The 'as-override' feature will not then 
   operate over PE-CE IPv4 links where public and private ASN numbers 
   are advertised within the same VPN address prefix.  

   Network elements located at a VPL should therefore be capable of 
   removing or changing public or private ASNs from the BGP AS_PATH 
   attribute on a per neighbor basis. This per neighbor AS path match 
   and removal policy should be capable of being performed on ingress 
   or egress across the entire AS path. 

     6.5.3.2. Route Distinguisher Allocation Considerations 

   VPN-IPv4 routes [RFC-4364] are made unique across a domain by 
   combining an IPv4 address with an 8 byte 'Route Distinguisher' (RD) 
   value. The advertisement of RD values end-to-end between VSPs, 
   combined with the customer's use of private [RFC-1918] addressing 
   could result in Route Reflectors (RR) making incorrect best path 
   decisions for identical routes received from external as well as 
   internal PE network elements. This will occur where RD and customer 
   address space overlap across VSP ASes. Although the probability of 
   this scenario is small, the consequences could be severe and 
   difficult to isolate, therefore VSP owned RRs and PE's SHOULD NOT

   receive VPN-IPv4 routes that have RD values assigned by another VSP. 
   In order to ensure that RD values that transit VPLs are unique, RD 
   values MUST be pre-pended by a public registered AS number [RFC-
   4364], section (4.1). 

     6.5.3.1. Route Target Allocation Considerations 

   VSPs usually have difficulty in provisioning extended (Route Target) 
   or standard BGP community values on their PE network elements that 
   are assigned by external parties such as the end customers Agent or 
   another VSP. This difficulty is due to the VSP having automated or 
   manual OSS systems and operational procedures that typically apply 
   to per VSP ASes only. These systems and processes are difficult to 
   change due to schema conflicts brought about by attempting to 
   incorporate externally assigned RT allocation schemas. In addition, 
   not all VSPs allocate RT values that are pre-pended with a publicly 
   registered ASN or IP address. RT values to be applied on VSP PEs 
   therefore should be assigned by the operator of the PE. In order to 
   ensure that BGP extended community values are unique between ASes, 
   RT values that are advertised across the VPL MUST be globally unique 
   (e.g. by pre-pending RT values with a public registered ASN). This 
   follows the specification detailed in the 'Identifiers' section of 
   [RFC-4031] and assists in the prevention of cross-connection for VPN 
   services.  

     6.5.3.2. Traffic Load Balancing Considerations 

   VSPs use various traffic load-balancing techniques between customer 
   sites to optimize traffic flows within their own ASes. As described 
   in [RFC-4364], this necessitates the use of different RD values 
   provisioned across VRFs to which the customer is multi-homed, but 
   the enforcement of a RD numbering policy at the scale of a MDE 
   should be consistent with the recommendations expressed in section 
   4.2 of [RFC-4364]. Similar mechanisms SHOULD be available when VSP 
   owned ASes are multi-homed across multiple VPLs and where the VSP 
   wishes to optimize customer traffic via load balancing. Such 
   mechanisms may require that the signaling protocol support the 
   advertisement of all available paths so that optimal path selection 
   is available as well as backup paths in case of optimal path 
   failure.

6.5.4. Multicast Routing Considerations 

   IP multicast transmission schemas may be used by some applications 
   such as videoconferencing or TV broadcasting in order to optimize 
   VPN network resources. 

   As a result, VSP owned network elements should support multicast 
   routing capabilities for the dynamic establishment and maintenance 
   of distribution trees within the VPN and should therefore be 
   provisioned with the relevant yet consistent configuration 
   information.  

   There are currently however no standards for, or agreement of, an 
   enforcement of consistent multicast routing policies amongst VSPs. 
   There is therefore a requirement to be able to enforce an end-to-end 
   multicast routing policy for the sake of the establishment and 
   maintenance of consistent distribution trees throughout an MDE. 

6.6. Topological Requirements Gap Analysis 

   Sub-sections 6.1. through 6.3. (inclusive) mostly deal with VPN 
   design guidelines, which could yield the publication of an 
   applicability statement document, as part of the VPN deployment 
   scenarios that are addressed by the l3vpn working group. 

   Section 6.4. includes requirements for the l3vpn working group. In 
   addition, this section motivates the need for an exhaustive 
   inventory of the set of VSP-specific elementary components 
   (interfaces, network elements, etc.) that will be used for deploying 
   an end-to-end VPN topology. This is the kind of information that may 
   be (partly) stored and maintained in the Management Information Base 
   described by [RFC-4382], but the global, service-wide dimensioning 
   of the end-to-end topology requirement may justify the specification 
   of a VPN service model, e.g. based upon [IYER].

   Sections 6.5.1. and 6.5.2. depict the need for populating the 
   network elements with routing policy-specific configuration 
   information. This requirement raises two issues: 

   - The means to describe, store, and maintain the routing-specific 
      (configuration) information that will be used by the network 
      elements to enforce the corresponding routing policies. 

   - The means to (reliably) convey such information to the network 
      elements. 

   While the latter could benefit from the work that has been conducted 
   by the netconf working group so far, the former (description, 
   storage and maintenance of configuration information) could be 
   viewed as part of the aforementioned VPN service model. 

   Section 6.5.3 lists layer-3 VPN specific attribute behavior 
   requirements which could be addressed by the l3vpn working group. 

   Section 6.5.4. elaborates on inter-AS multicast VPN requirements 
   that could be addressed by the l3vpn working group. 

7. QoS Requirements 

   Quality of service is a very generic term, which is sometimes 
   misused, especially when applied to IP/MPLS environments. In this 
   document, the design and the enforcement of a QoS policy within VPN-
   specific MDE environments relies upon the following dimensions: 

   - A forwarding dimension, which consists of ensuring that a VSP 
      owned network element behaves differently, depending on the kind 
      of traffic it has to process and subsequently forward. This 
      yields a need for VPN traffic identification, classification and 
      possibly activation of traffic conditioning, policing, scheduling 
      and optionally, discarding mechanisms. The forwarding dimension 
      of a QoS policy is a notion that is local to a network element, 
      independent from the expected behaviors of the other network 
      elements within the MDE. The DiffServ (Differentiated Services) 
      architecture, as described in [RFC-2475], is generally seen as 
      the cornerstone of the forwarding dimension, introducing the 
      notion of classes of service as well as Behavior Aggregates (BA). 

   - A metric definition dimension, which consists of defining 
      consistent metrics such as delay, jitter and loss, so as to 
      support QoS meaningfully across multiple VSPs.

Internet-Draft draft-halstead-guichard-mavs-requirements-02    May 2006 
    

   - A routing dimension, which consists of enforcing a VPN-specific 
      traffic engineering policy at the scale of a MDE. Traffic 
      engineering is a set of capabilities that allow the (hopefully 
      dynamic) computation and selection of paths that will be used to 
      convey different kinds of VPN traffic. It may be necessary to 
      route QoS-sensitive traffic to different VSPs or along different 
      paths other than those selected by best effort traffic. Path 
      selection is dependant on the (QoS) characteristics of such 
      paths, which comply with the QoS requirements that have been 
      expressed and negotiated by the Agent with their VPN customers.   

   - A monitoring dimension, which consists of qualifying how 
      efficient a QoS policy is enforced within a MDE, based upon the 
      use and measurement of well-defined indicators. Due to the 
      multiple parties involved in the delivery of QoS, it is necessary 
      to have well defined methods for measurement of QoS, ways to 
      monitor the performance of different network elements, and ways 
      to report performance consistently among VSPs. Such indicators 
      include (but may not be limited to) one-way transit delay, one-
      way inter-packet delay variation (sometimes called jitter), one-
      way packet loss rate or any combination of such indicators.   

7.1. Differentiated Services Policy Considerations 

   Currently, there are no standards for or agreement of service 
   definitions as defined in the Diffserv architecture amongst VSPs. 
   [RFC-3644] defines QoS policy within a single Diffserv domain as 
   being dependent upon three types of information:  

   - The topology of the network elements under management;  

   - The particular type of QoS methodology used (e.g. Diffserv), and;  

   - The business rules and requirements for specifying service(s) 
      delivered by the network.  

   These information types vary across VSP ASes. Consequently, VSPs 
   deploy different numbers of classes of service (COS) and specify 
   service definitions in proprietary ways. Fixed mappings of classes 
   of service between any two VSPs may result in compromised service 
   across the two. This is in part because fixed mappings cannot always 
   utilize the full service envelope available from the interconnected 
   VSPs (a VSP with three classes of service can only utilize 3/5ths of 
   the service envelope of a VSP with five classes of service). 
   Furthermore,  fixed mappings may be adequate for some Agent's 
   customers, but not for others. This is because QoS policy is often 

 
 
                      Expires November 8, 2006               [Page 21] 

Internet-Draft draft-halstead-guichard-mavs-requirements-02    May 2006 
    

   applied in different ways for each application used in each customer 
   environment 

   When three or more VSP ASes are used to provide connectivity between 
   customer sites, two or more VPLs are required and, therefore, a 
   multiple, compounding service compromise exists.  

   In an MDE of many VSP ASes and VPLs, it is clear that numerous and 
   compounding compromises in service will take place and end-to-end 
   QoS policy enforcement may be hard to achieve.  

   There is a requirement, therefore, for a relationship to exist 
   between VSP classes of service that may vary from one customer to 
   another, and that can also utilize the full service envelope of all 
   VSPs within an MDE.  

7.1.1. QoS Policy Transparency 

   There is general agreement that customer packets should not be 
   remarked (that is, have their DSCP values modified) as they transit 
   the MDE. At the same time, it is often necessary for the VSP to 
   impose a QoS treatment on customer packets that differs from that 
   which might be indicated by the customer's DSCP (such as is the case 
   for non-conforming traffic downgraded to best effort). However, even 
   if the packets are treated as best effort by the VSP, the customer 
   wishes to retain the original DSCP marking for their own use when 
   the packets arrive at their remote site. This requirement is defined 
   as "QoS transparency", where the transparency in question refers to 
   the tunneling of the customer QoS policy, unmodified, from ingress 
   to egress across an MDE. [RFC-4031] describes this requirement as a 
   'Carrier's Carrier' model where one VSP is the customer of another 
   VSP. Such a VSP should be able to resell VPN services to their 
   customers independent of the DSCP mapping solution employed by the 
   'Carrier's Carrier' VSP.  

   There is a requirement, therefore, for enterprise QoS policy 
   transparency throughout an MDE. 

7.2. Consistent Metric Considerations 

   Currently, there are no standards for, or agreement of metric 
   definitions between VSPs. As an example, the Low Latency service 
   class is generally characterized by three network performance 
   metrics; latency, packet loss, and jitter. These metrics are 
   generally reported as two-way or one-way derived from two-way 
   measurements, but are generally defined differently between VSPs.

   There is therefore a requirement to produce service classes with 
   metrics that can be meaningfully concatenated, so as to provide 
   reasonable commonality of metrics across VSPs. 

7.3. Traffic Engineering/Routing Policy Considerations  

   In a true MDE environment there may be many alternate paths between 
   customer sites. The preferred path among VSPs is typically 
   determined by BGP policies. However, when multiple classes of 
   service exist, it may be desirable to route some traffic 
   preferentially via VSPs who support the enhanced QoS class(es) while 
   best effort traffic takes the conventional route. That is to say, 
   there may be cases in which the current route selection capabilities 
   of BGP, which yield only a single best path for a given prefix, may 
   not be sufficient. The deployment of traffic engineering 
   capabilities in VPL owned network elements is of importance when 
   considering the joint forwarding of "triple-play" services where 
   data, video and voice traffic is forwarded within a given VPN.   

   Within a MDE, VSPs or Agents should provide configuration 
   information parameters that will allow network elements to choose 
   appropriate VPN paths to a given destination based on ''Service 
   Contexts''. These paths are chosen according to application-specific 
   constraints, available service characteristics and/or requirements.  

   These constraints and/or requirements may be expressed in terms of 
   time duration (e.g. the use of a VPN route on a weekly basis), 
   traffic characterization (e.g. all IP multicast traffic should be 
   forwarded along a set of specific VPN routes), security concerns 
   (e.g. use trusted network elements along the path towards specific 
   destinations), and/or QoS considerations (e.g. marked VPN traffic 
   with a specific DiffServ Code Point (DSCP) value should always use a 
   configured set of traffic-engineered VPN routes, or available exit 
   point that exhibits the desired ''Service Context'').  

7.4. Metrology Considerations 

   Currently, there are no standards for, or agreement of, measurement 
   methods amongst VSPs. VSPs define measurements differently and 
   measure different service end points. In a MDE environment, 
   measurement methodology differences, particularly differences in the 
   statistical nature of the measurements, make it impossible to 
   combine VSP measurement reports so that the overall quality of the 
   VPN service can be qualified.  

   As VSP reports can be so different, it is tedious and time consuming 
   to analyze whether an individual VSP or VPL operator has met its

   performance targets. When end-to-end services fail, it may be very 
   difficult to analyze VSP measurement data in order to detect and 
   isolate faults amongst VSPs or VPL operators.  

   In an MDE, where the customer's Agent(s) are responsible for end-to-
   end service, this may be untenable. In addition, whilst windows for 
   scheduled and unscheduled maintenance will remain difficult for the 
   Agent(s) to control or coordinate, any measurement methodology must 
   take these windows into account in any performance assessments of 
   the QoS policy that are made.  

   There is, therefore, a requirement for statistically homogenous 
   measurement throughout an MDE as well as the ability to place 
   measurement instrumentation/sources at VPL locations in order to aid 
   fault detection and isolation. 

7.5. QoS Requirements Gap Analysis 

   Section 7.1. discusses the need for exchanging QoS information 
   between VSPs. This assumes that such information is described, 
   stored, and maintained by each participating VSP, but also that a 
   protocol is required to exchange such information between VSP 
   providers. The specification of a QoS policy could be viewed as part 
   of the VPN service model specification effort (as mentioned in 
   section 6.6. ). The corresponding configuration information to be 
   used by the network elements to enforce such QoS policies could 
   benefit from the work conducted by the netconf working group. To 
   exchange such information between VSPs, there are several candidate 
   protocols which include (but are not necessarily limited to) RSVP, 
   BGP and the protocol to be specified by the pce working group (since 
   such information might be used by Path Computation Elements to 
   compute traffic-engineered paths).  

   The need for the use of consistent metrics (as described in section 
   7.2. ) could rely upon the work conducted by the ippm and pce 
   working groups (since the latter is chartered to define objective 
   metrics that will aim at evaluating the quality of a traffic-
   engineered path, for example).  

   Section 7.3. describes the need for populating network elements with 
   routing and traffic engineering configuration information. Such 
   information can be viewed as part of the description of the overall 
   QoS policy that will have to be consistently enforced by the 
   participating VSP providers for the delivery and the operation of a 
   given VPN service. Both the netconf and pce working groups could be 
   solicited to investigate the corresponding (protocol-specific)

   issues, but this is also the kind of requirement that advocates the 
   specification and the instantiation of a VPN service model. 

   From a metrology standpoint as described in section 7.4. , the work 
   conducted by the ippm working group (OWAMP (One-Way Active 
   Measurement Protocol, [OWAMP]), and TWAMP (Two-Way Active 
   Measurement Protocol, [TWAMP]) protocols) could serve as a basis for 
   investigating the consistency issues raised by this section. 

8. Security Requirements 

   Security is a requirement of any business, but the requirement 
   becomes more important where that business collaborates with others 
   to provide a service [RFC-4111]. Potential threats might emanate 
   from a number of sources, for instance, other VSPs, VPL operators 
   and customers.  

   Clearly, the vulnerability of a customer service to threats from 
   these sources is of paramount importance. Of equal importance is the 
   vulnerability of a VSP AS to threats from these sources. An attack 
   on a VSP AS could detrimentally affect numerous customers, including 
   those attached to other VSP owned ASes.  

8.1. Security Information Requirements 

   Enforcement of a security policy at the scale of a MDE may rely upon 
   the following capabilities:  

   - The identification and the authentication of the users who may be 
      entitled to access the VPN service,  

   - The identification and authentication of network elements that 
      will not only participate in the deployment and the operation of 
      the VPN, but also in VPN route information propagation, 

   - The preservation of the confidentiality of information within a 
      VPN.  

   VSPs should therefore be provided with configuration information 
   related to the aforementioned security parameters. This does not 
   mean that VSP owned network elements have to maintain a dynamically 
   updated user database, rather, they should be provided with the 
   following configuration information:  

   - Identification information for IP networks that may exchange data 
      through the VPN and/or the configuration information required for 
      the activation of an identification/authentication mechanism such 
 
 
                      Expires November 8, 2006               [Page 25]

      as RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service), [RFC-
      2865],  

   - Identification information for VSP owned network elements that 
      support endpoint(s) of the MP-BGP peer and possibly configuration 
      information related to the activation of a mechanism for 
      identifying and authenticating such peers, 

   - Configuration information required for encryption purposes. This 
      requirement is further expanded on in section 8.2.  

   There is a requirement, therefore, to securely forward VPN related 
   security parameters between VSPs and Agents. 

8.2. Encryption Requirements 

   VPN customers may require all or part of their encrypted traffic to 
   be preserved, independent of the number of VSP owned ASes within the 
   MDE supporting their VPN service. 

   There is therefore a need for the MDE to support any relevant 
   encryption technique that preserves the confidentiality of the VPN 
   traffic. This implies that: 

   - The VSP owned network elements that compose the MDE should 
      support protocols of the IPsec suite [RFC-4301], 

   - The MDE should be capable of supporting an adequate means for 
      identifying and authenticating any participating device involved 
      in the forwarding of VPN traffic, 

   - The MDE should be capable of supporting an adequate means for 
      identifying and authenticating any participating VSP owned 
      network element involved in the enforcement of the VPN-specific 
      routing policy. Such means should enable any VSP owned network 
      element to check the integrity of received VPN route 
      announcements, 

   - The MDE should be capable of supporting and enforcing any dynamic 
      key management scheme suitable for the dynamic establishment of 
      Secure Associations (SA) between relevant VSP owned network 
      elements without jeopardizing the scalability of the VPN service, 

   - VSPs that are involved in the dynamic establishment of SA 
      associations across their ASes should be provided with relevant 
      configuration information (keys, passwords) in a timely manner, 
      that is, the provisioning of such configuration information 
 
 
                      Expires November 8, 2006               [Page 26]

      should not jeopardize the time to deliver the VPN service 
      offering to the customer with the required level of security (nor 
      its scalability).  

8.3. Label Spoofing Protection 

   Whenever labels are exchanged between two VSP peers it is possible 
   that the spoofing of such labels may occur either toward the 
   internal infrastructure of the said VSPs, or within the VPNs that 
   are supported by such VSPs. There is therefore a requirement to 
   provide mechanisms that prevent the spoofing of labels in the 
   forwarding path. 

8.4. Authentication Requirements 

8.4.1. Authentication of Network Elements 

   Within a MDE, every VSP owned network element that participates in 
   the deployment and the operation of a VPN service offering should be 
   trusted. This trust model may need to be specifically defined on a 
   per-VSP peering basis. There is therefore a requirement to provide 
   acceptable authentication processes in order for a network element 
   to participate in the deployment and operation of a VPN service. 
   This implies that every VSP owned network element must be identified 
   and authenticated typically via processes owned by relevant Agents 
   or VSPs. 

8.4.2. VPN Route Authentication and Filtering 

   Within a MDE, every VSP owned network element is permitted to 
   announce VPN routes to some or all of its pre-authenticated peers, 
   assuming the requirements expressed in section 8. 1. have been 
   addressed. 

   VSPs have existing mechanisms and operational processes that prevent 
   the cross connection of VPNs within their own ASes. These mechanisms 
   include manual or automated systems for VPN membership allocations 
   that include per customer RT values. Where the VSP extends VPN 
   services via an MDE, incorrect or malicious configuration of VPN 
   membership information could result in cross connection or incorrect 
   announcement of VPN membership attributes across an MDE. These route 
   announcements could in addition expose the VPN topology of the VSP.  

   The integrity of the contents of such VPN route announcements must 
   be authenticated by any receiving peer and/or by some kind of VPN 
   route server capability that could be embedded in the relevant Agent 
   or VSP owned facility before the receiving peer accepts the

   announced route. Draft [VPN-VERIFICATION] could assist with this 
   route authentication requirement.   

   It should be possible to enforce further VPN route-specific 
   filtering policies at appropriate locations within an MDE. 
   Additional route filtering criteria could be based upon (but not 
   necessarily limited to): 

   - Intra-VPL communication restriction where, for example, RT value 
      announcements are filtered such that they only include interested 
      parties across VPL locations. This filtering policy is 
      particularly relevant where the VSP owned network elements peer 
      with more than one network element at a VPL. This function is 
      described further in [RT-CONSTRAIN] 

   - Intra-VPN communication restrictions, where, for example, not all 
      sites are permitted to communicate 

   - The contracted metrics with the VPN customer and between VSPs for 
      routing table size, routing protocol type, and end-to-end routing 
      policy. 

   - The required end-to-end convergence time to avoid the case where 
      restoration policies, timer values, or fast convergence protocols 
      (such as BFD), differ between VSPs. 

   - Inter-AS routing restrictions, where, for example, some VPN 
      traffic shouldn't be transported across one or more ASes within 
      an MDE 

   - Time based restrictions, where, for example, some destinations 
      cannot be reached during working hours, 

   - QoS based restrictions, where, for example, traffic should not be 
      bound for VPN route sources that experience more than a 100 ms 
      one-way transit delay. Traffic route sources that experience 
      delay over a certain threshold should not then be announced at 
      selected VPLs.

8.5. Security Requirements Gap Analysis 

   While sections 8. and 8.2. could undoubtedly rely upon the work that 
   has been conducted by the btns and pki4ipsec (in particular) working 
   groups, sections 8.3. and 8.4. raise issues that could be partly 
   covered by the recently-created sidr working group (VPN route 
   authentication, in particular). 

9. Management Requirements 

9.1. Performance Metric Statistic Requirements 

   Agents have stringent usage requirements for an MDE. From this 
   perspective, VSPs should permit an Agent to have access to 
   statistical information based upon, (but not necessarily limited 
   to):  

   - The volume of traffic that has been conveyed by the entire VPN, a 
      specific VPN route, forwarded by a specific network element or 
      over a given period of time that may include a distinction 
      between incoming and outgoing traffic,  

   - The volume of VPN traffic that has been dropped by network 
      elements within a given period of time,   

   - IPPM (IP Performance Metrics) [RFC-2330] related information that 
      is relevant to tunnel usage: such information includes one-way 
      transit delay, inter-packet delay variation etc., 

   - Routing state convergence.  

9.2. Capital Scaling Requirements 

   In an MDE, there might be one or more VPLs. At each VPL there may be 
   one or more interconnected VSP ASes, or a single VSP that uses the 
   VPL for connectivity between their own ASes.  

   Traditionally, the interconnection of two VSP ASes has resulted in 
   the deployment of network element resources that are either 
   dedicated to those two VSPs, or leased from the VPL operator.  

   Where there is a need for a VSP to interconnect with multiple other 
   VSPs, scaling cost efficiency could result if interconnected network 
   elements could be shared across all VSPs. This multilateral approach 

 
 
                      Expires November 8, 2006               [Page 29] 

Internet-Draft draft-halstead-guichard-mavs-requirements-02    May 2006 
    

   to VPL design will have increasing benefit as the number of 
   interconnected VSPs at a VPL increases.  

   Interconnected network elements at VPLs must therefore be shared 
   multilaterally.  

9.3. Operational Scaling Requirements 

   Cost of operations is of great concern to a VSP, whether or not VPN 
   services span their own ASes or those of their VSP partners. 
   Compared to the capital cost of MDE interconnection at a VPL, 
   operational cost easily dominates. In an MDE, some, and perhaps all 
   VSPs, might play a part in delivering services to an individual 
   customer's VPN.  

   Within a customer VPN, sites, physical and logical connectivity, 
   VSPs, VPLs and VPN-specific policies might be variously moved, 
   added, changed or deleted (MACD) at any time. In fact, different 
   components of the VPN will, at times, undergo MACD concurrently.  

   Service MACD lifecycle is part of any customer VPN and will happen 
   as needed throughout the VPN's service life. As an MDE evolves, with 
   increasing numbers of VSPs, VPLs and customers, the amount of 
   service MACD will increase and place a continual and increasing 
   burden on VSP operators throughout an MDE unless a scalable approach 
   is taken. Operational scaling criteria could be based upon (but are 
   not necessarily limited to) the following sections. 

9.3.1. Service Independence Requirements 

   In an MDE, it is inevitable that dependencies will exist between the 
   services of individual VSPs. For example, a lack of forethought by 
   the VPL operator by implementing a 'tightly-coupled' VPL 
   interconnect environment would result in single VSP changes to 
   topology, bandwidth, routing, QoS, etc., requiring all other VSPs to 
   modify their definitions of existing services.  

   Service dependencies amongst VSPs in a MDE must therefore be 
   minimized. 

9.3.2. Minimize Network Integration Requirements 

   Currently there is no common agreement for how VSPs implement the 
   interconnection of their VPN networks. This means that each inter-AS 
   interconnect agreement at a VPL by VSP pairs will be a unique 
   project, each of which potentially having different design goals and 
   compromises.  
 
 
                      Expires November 8, 2006               [Page 30] 

Internet-Draft draft-halstead-guichard-mavs-requirements-02    May 2006 
    

   Each unique inter-AS interconnect agreement will usually take 
   considerable time and consume highly skilled resources in both 
   organizations. As the number of VPLs increases, so the load on the 
   organizations will increase. In an MDE, the required number of 
   unique inter-AS interconnect agreements could rapidly become 
   untenable. Unique network inter-AS interconnect agreements amongst 
   VSP pairs must therefore be minimized.  

9.3.3. Third Party Interconnect Requirements 

   Agents or VSPs require the ability to provide end-to-end services 
   within an MDE. These Agents or VSPs may however have no desire or be 
   unable to administer the coordination of business and operational 
   processes involved in establishing an MDE. In order for an MDE to be 
   established, the Agent or VSP may therefore require a third party 
   operator to provide these business and operational process services.  

   It may be that the third party is another VSP, a systems integrator, 
   a network integrator or another type of service provider. To achieve 
   end-to-end service, it is critical that the third party operator is 
   able to control and coordinate global service business and 
   operational process policy throughout the MDE.  

   There is, therefore, a requirement for the business and operational 
   processes involved in establishing an MDE to be administered by a 
   third party operator. 

9.4. IPVPN Services Demarcation Requirements 

9.4.1. Fully Managed Service Demarcation 

   [RFC-4364] based VPN services may encompass a 'fully managed' 
   Customer Edge (CE) to CE service with associated SLSs. In an MDE, 
   this 'fully managed' service is interconnected to other VSP-owned 
   services via VPLs. For SLS demarcation purposes, the VSP may express 
   a preference to collocate a dedicated network element at each VPL. 
   The VPL collocated network elements will, from an operational 
   perspective function identically to a CE. In contrast to a standard 
   CE however, each VPL collocated network element will usually support 
   more than a single VPN across one or more customers and/or VSPs. 
   From a scalability perspective, this is particularly advantageous 
   for the VSP when interconnecting multiple VPN services at each VPL 
   on behalf of one or more Agents. The SLS offered by the VSP to each 
   Agent partner will in addition to CE-to-CE connectivity, include 
   connectivity from each CE to one or more VPL collocated network 
   elements.  

 
 
                      Expires November 8, 2006               [Page 31] 

Internet-Draft draft-halstead-guichard-mavs-requirements-02    May 2006 
    

   For contractual and/or technical reasons, the VSP may decide for 
   example to collocate a network element per Agent, per group of 
   Agents or per VPN. In all cases, consistent, unambiguous service 
   boundaries for the fully managed service offering are essential.  

   There is a requirement, therefore for consistent SLS demarcation 
   points across 'fully managed' VPN service offerings within an MDE. 

9.4.2. Mixed Management Service Demarcation 

   In addition to 'fully managed' services, VSPs also offer VPN 
   services that allow for a third party such as the VSPs customers to 
   manage their own CE network elements. IPVPN connectivity of the 
   customers' CEs via the VSP-owned ASes is done via VSP-owned access 
   facilities. This type of VPN network outsourcing is known as an 
   'unbundled' or 'wires-only' service. SLSs are negotiated between the 
   VSP and their customers that allow the customer managed CE's to 
   intercommunicate. 

   In an MDE, when an 'unbundled' service is procured from a VSP by an 
   Agent, the Agent may want to use the 'unbundled' service to extend 
   the geographic reach of their VPN footprint by connecting this 
   service to one or more VPLs. Again, for SLS demarcation purposes, 
   the VSP may express a preference to collocate a network element at 
   each VPL.  

   SLS demarcation points for the selling VSP may then include VPL 
   collocated network elements that are shared across one or more 
   Agents and/or VPNs, access facilities linking the Agent-owned CEs, 
   and common [RFC-4364] based VPN services that span the VSP-owned 
   AS(es). The Agent must then offer SLSs to their customer that 
   encompass the VSPs 'unbundled' service and associated SLS(s), as 
   well as their managed CE offering.  

   There is a requirement, therefore, for consistent 'unbundled' 
   service SLS demarcation points across an MDE.  

9.5. Remote CE Management Requirement 

   For contractual and/or technical reasons, Agents or customers have a 
   requirement to manage Customer Edge (CE) network elements that are 
   interconnected as part of a [RFC-4364] based VPN service. In an MDE, 
   the ASes supporting these VPNs may or may not be operated by the 
   Agent. The Agent will in addition to managing VPN services on behalf 
   of their customers, usually operate a management network to which 
   their end customers have restricted or no access. The management 
   network is used to provide as a minimum IP-based connectivity

   between CEs and the Agent's operations staff, typically located in 
   one or more operations centers. 

   In order for an Agent to directly manage CEs connected to ASes that 
   they do not operate, the Agent will procure 'unbundled' VPN services 
   from one or more VSP partners. In addition to SLSs that are 
   negotiated between the Agent and the selling VSP for CE-to-CE 
   communication, the Agent requires SLSs that encompass the connection 
   of each CE to the Agent's management network. 

   There is a requirement, therefore, for an Agent to remotely manage 
   CE network elements that are directly interconnected through one or 
   more ASes that are operated by the Agent's VSP partners. The VSP 
   partner should therefore be capable of supporting one or more common 
   management network connectivity methods selected by the Agent.  

9.6. End-to-End Combined Services Requirement 

9.6.1. Combined VPN and Internet Access Requirement 

   It is common for VSPs to offer combined Internet access and VPN 
   services via a shared networking infrastructure, e.g. based upon 
   [RFC-4364]. In an MDE, when an Agent offers this service, it is 
   sometimes advantageous for the Agent if their VSP partners could 
   support the local 'breakout' of traffic destined for the Internet 
   within the VSPs own ASes. An alternative to this is for all 
   customers Internet and VPN traffic to be transported by the Agent's 
   VSP partners across VPLs to Internet 'breakout' location(s) in other 
   ASes. These traffic paths are inevitably suboptimal, raising 
   performance concerns with the Agent's customers. In addition, the 
   service is potentially expensive to deliver for the Agent, as there 
   is little or no differentiation between traffic paths carrying 
   mission-critical VPN traffic and Internet destined best effort 
   traffic as all traffic will be forwarded by the VSP partner across 
   one or more VPLs. 

   There is a requirement, therefore, in an MDE for VSPs to provide 
   consistent Internet 'breakout' services that are compatible with an 
   Agents combined Internet access and VPN services. These 
   compatibility requirements include (but are not limited to): 

   - Security, Authentication, Intrusion Detection, Virus protection 
      services etc. 

   - Consistent QoS policies across VSPs for best effort or better 
      than best effort Internet-destined traffic.

9.6.2. Combined IP and non-IP Application Transport Requirement 

   Some VSPs offer managed services that include the transporting of 
   non-IP application traffic across a shared networking infrastructure 
   based on [RFC-4364]. These 'legacy' applications use networking 
   protocols (for example X.25, SNA and IPX) that typically do not 
   support an IP network layer header and therefore cannot natively be 
   transported across VSP operated ASes. The non-IP packets must 
   therefore be 'tunneled' across VSP ASes by adding IP and MPLS 
   headers to the packets. Either end of a 'legacy' application 
   transport tunnel must support configurations that are based on non-
   IP application specific configuration parameters for mapping non-IP 
   network layer application sources to destination tunnel network 
   element IP addresses. In an MDE, the non-IP transport tunnel could 
   span one or more VSP-owned ASes. Network elements that originate and 
   terminate packets that are forwarded across these non-IP tunnels 
   could therefore be operated by different VSPs. 

   There is a requirement, therefore, in an MDE for consistent non-IP 
   application transport tunnels to be supported by participating VSPs 
   in an MDE. Tunnel transport consistency per non-IP protocol must 
   take into account amongst others, agreements on MTU sizing, SLS 
   conformance, vendor proprietary and standardized encapsulation 
   techniques etc.   

9.7. Management Requirements Gap Analysis 

   The work that needs to be done to address the requirement described 
   in section 9.1. can rely upon the work conducted by the ippm working 
   group. Sections 9.2. and 9.3. (as well as sections 9.5. and 9.6. ) 
   rather refer to operational procedures and guidelines which may not 
   justify an involvement of the IETF.  

   But section 9.4. (and section 9.4.2. in particular) encourages the 
   development of the work formerly initialized by the late diffserv 
   working group, which introduced the notion of SLS. There is 
   currently no known IETF effort which would aim at specifying a 
   format for a SLS template, as discussed in [SLS] for example.

10. Conclusions 

   This section extracts from the gap analysis sections, the suitable 
   actions that are to be conducted for the delivery of BGP/MPLS-based 
   [RFC-4364] VPN services across multiple administrative domains. 

   Exhaustive inventories of the set of VSP-specific elementary 
   components (interfaces, network elements) will be used for deploying 
   an end-to-end multi-provider VPN topology. This information may be 
   (partly) stored and maintained in the Management Information Base 
   described by [RFC-4382]. Nevertheless, the global, service-wide 
   dimension of the end-to-end topology justifies the specification of 
   a VPN service model, e.g. based upon [IYER].  

   - Reliably populating network elements with routing (policy-
      specific) configuration information is the base building block 
      for providing VPN services across multiple VSPs. This information 
      will be used by the network elements to enforce the corresponding 
      routing policies. Several candidate working groups could be 
      solicited to investigate the corresponding (protocol-specific) 
      issues. This requirement advocates the specification and the 
      instantiation of a VPN service model including the description, 
      storage and maintenance of routing configuration information. 
      Such work could be the primary focus of a newly dedicated effort.  

   - QoS policy must be consistently enforced by the participating VSP 
      providers for the delivery and the operation of a given VPN 
      service. QoS policy information exchanges between VSP providers 
      require a specific protocol. Several candidate protocols to 
      exchange such information between VSPs have to be investigated. 
      This investigation should lead to specific extensions to these 
      protocols or initiation of a dedicated QoS information exchange 
      protocol. The corresponding configuration information to be used 
      by the network elements to enforce QoS policies could benefit 
      from the work conducted by the netconf WG. This information may 
      be complemented by QoS routing information. 

   To support QoS meaningfully across multiple VSPs a consistent set of 
   metrics shall be defined to provide for consistent service classes. 
   Moreover performance measurement and monitoring techniques shall be 
   investigated. Work conducted by the ippm WG (OWAMP (One-Way Active 
   Measurement Protocol, [OWAMP]), and TWAMP (Two-Way Active 
   Measurement Protocol, [TWAMP]) protocols) should serve a basis of 
   this investigation. Performance statistics collections can rely upon 
   the work conducted by the ippm working group. Dedicated effort is

   expected to extended relevant work such as to provide for the 
   suitable techniques as required for multi-SP environments. 

   Providing consistent 'unbundled' service demarcation points across 
   an MDE and consistent demarcation points across 'fully managed' VPN 
   service offerings within an MDE encourages the introduction and 
   development of SLS. There is currently no known IETF effort, which 
   would aim at specifying a format and exchange mechanisms of SLS 
   templates. This task could become a specific item of a dedicated 
   effort in operating multi-SP VPNs. 

   Encryption work that has been conducted by the btns and pki4ipsec 
   (in particular) working groups fulfill the needs of multi-provider 
   VPNs. Label spoofing and authentication requirements are partly 
   covered by the recently-created sidr working group (VPN route 
   authentication, in particular). 

   VPN design guidelines and deployment scenarios, could result in the 
   publication of an applicability statement document by the l3vpn WG. 

   The following efforts have been identified: 

   - Specification of a VPN service model including the description, 
   storage and maintenance of routing policy and QoS policy 
   configuration information. 

   - Protocol(s) and/or extension to existing protocols to exchange the 
   corresponding information between VSP providers. 

   - Definition of a consistent set of metrics shall be defined to 
   provide for consistent service classes.  

   - Performance measurement, statistic collection and monitoring 
   techniques shall be investigated as extension to the work initiated 
   by the ippm working group.   

   - Specification of a format and exchange mechanisms of SLS 
   templates.  

   - Extend applicability of the encryption work conducted by the btns 
   and pki4ipsec working groups and the newly initiated work of the 
   sidr working group for VPN information authentication. 

   - Provide VPN design guidelines and deployment scenarios as 
   extension of the applicability statement document of the l3vpn WG.
