1.  Introduction

   This document extends the base PCP [RFC6887] with the ability to
   associate a human-readable description with a PCP-instantiated
   mapping.  It does so by defining a new DESCRIPTION option.

   This PCP option can be used in both simple scenarios with a PCP
   client and PCP server, as well as in more complex scenarios where an
   interworking function is used to proxy between a UPnP IGD Control
   Point and a PCP server [RFC6970].

   Querying the PCP server to get the description text of an existing
   mapping is out of scope.

2.  Format

   The format of the DESCRIPTION option is shown in Figure 1.

        This Option:

         Option Name: DESCRIPTION
         Number: <TBA>
         Purpose: Used to associate a text description with a mapping
         Valid for Opcodes: MAP, PEER
         Length: Variable,  maximum 1016 octets.
         May appear in: request. May appear in response only if it
                        appeared in the associated request.
         Maximum occurrences: 1


                       Figure 1: Description Option

   The 'Reserved' field is initialized as specified in section 7.3 of
   [RFC6887].

   The Description field MUST carry UTF-8 encoded [RFC3629] description
   text.  The description text MUST NOT be null terminated.  The length
   of the description text is indicated by the Length field.  In
   particular, the description text is not null terminated and when a
   client or server receives a DESCRIPTION option, it MUST NOT rely on
   the presence of a NUL character in the wire format data to identify
   the end of the text.

   This option can be used by a user (or an application) to indicate a
   description associated with a given mapping such as "FTP server", "My
   remote access to my CP router", "Camera", "Network attached storage
   serve", etc.

   How the content of the DESCRIPTION option is used is deployment-
   specific.  For example, the description text can be used by the
   entity managing the PCP server for many purposes such as the
   following:

   o  The description text can be used as a hint when cleaning a mapping
      table by an administrator.

   o  In some deployments making use of a portal to instruct PCP
      mappings (e.g., Section 5.2 of
      [I-D.boucadair-pcp-deployment-cases]), the description text can be
      used to store a subscriber identifier .

3.  Behavior

   The DESCRIPTION option is optional to be supported by PCP servers and
   PCP clients.  This option (Code TBA, Figure 1) MAY be included in a
   PCP MAP/PEER request to associate a description with the requested
   mapping.

   A PCP server MAY ignore the DESCRIPTION option sent to it by a PCP
   client (e.g., if it does not support the option, or it is configured
   to ignore it).  To signal that it has not accepted the option, a PCP
   server simply does not include the DESCRIPTION option in the
   response.  If the PCP client does not receive a DESCRIPTION option in
   a response to a request enclosing a DESCRIPTION option, this means
   the PCP server does not support that option or it is configured to
   ignore it.

   If the DESCRIPTION option is not included in the PCP client request,
   the PCP server MUST NOT include the DESCRIPTION option in the
   associated response.

   Because of the UDP payload limit of 1100 octets [RFC6887], the
   configured maximum length MUST NOT exceed 1016 octets.  The suggested
   maximum length is 128 octets.  If a PCP client includes a DESCRIPTION
   option with a length exceeding the maximum length supported by the
   PCP server, only the portion of the Description field fitting that
   maximum length is stored by the PCP server and returned to the PCP
   client in the response.

   If the PCP server receives a DESCRIPTION option having a length which
   does not exceed the maximum value configured, the PCP server MUST
   record the complete sequence of the description text and MUST send
   back to the PCP client the same DESCRIPTION option as the one
   included in the request.

   If the PCP client request contains invalid DESCRIPTION options (e.g.,
   the content is not a legal UTF-8 string), the PCP server MUST ignore
   the request (i.e., MUST NOT return a DESCRIPTION option in the
   response).

   To update the description text of a mapping maintained by a PCP
   server, the PCP client generates a PCP MAP/PEER renewal request which
   includes a DESCRIPTION option carrying the new description text.
   Upon receipt of the PCP request, the PCP server proceeds to the same

   operations to validate a MAP/PEER request refreshing an existing
   mapping.  If validation checks are successfully passed, the PCP
   server replaces the old description text with the new one included in
   the DESCRIPTION option, and the PCP server returns the updated
   description text in the response, truncated (if necessary) as
   described above.

   The PCP client uses empty DESCRIPTION option (i.e., Length set to 0)
   to erase the description text associated with a mapping.  To indicate
   that the PCP server has successfully cleared the description text
   associated with a mapping, the PCP server returns back the empty
   DESCRIPTION option in the response.

4.  Security Considerations

   PCP-related security considerations are discussed in [RFC6887].  In
   addition, administrators of PCP servers SHOULD configure a maximum
   description length which does not lead to exhausting storage
   resources in the PCP server.

   If the PCP client and the PCP server are not under the same
   administrative entity, the DESCRIPTION option has the potential to
   leak privacy-related information.  PCP clients should not use
   DESCRIPTION option for such leakage.  For example, the option should
   not be used to include user identifiers, locations, or names.  Refer
   to Section 3.2 of [RFC6462] for a discussion on information leakage.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The following PCP Option Codes are to be allocated in the optional-
   to-process range (the registry is maintained in http://www.iana.org/
   assignments/pcp-parameters):

      DESCRIPTION set to TBA (see Section 2)
