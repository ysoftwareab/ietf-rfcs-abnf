Abstract

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) currently supports grouping
   media lines.  SDP also has semantics defined for grouping the
   associated source and Forward Error Correction (FEC)-based repair
   flows.  However, the existing specifications have strict requirements
   that severely limit the use of the new features that are currently
   under development in the FECFRAME WG.  These new features will allow
   applications to use FEC in a more flexible way but they require
   changes in the current specifications.  This document provides a list

Internet-Draft         FEC Grouping Issues in SDP          February 2008


1.  Introduction

   The FEC Framework [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] outlines a general
   framework for using Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes in
   multimedia applications that stream audio, video or other types of
   multimedia content.

   Any application that needs a reliable transmission over an unreliable
   packet network has to cope with the packet losses.  FEC is an
   effective approach that provides reliable transmission particularly
   in multicast and broadcast applications where the feedback from the
   receiver(s) is potentially limited.

   In a nutshell, FEC groups source packets into blocks and applies
   protection to generate a desired number of repair packets.  These
   repair packets may be sent on demand or independently of any receiver
   feedback.  The choice depends on the FEC scheme or the Content
   Delivery Protocol used by the application, the error characteristics
   of the underlying network, the transport scheme (e.g., unicast,
   multicast, and broadcast), and the application.  At the receiver
   side, lost packets can be recovered by erasure decoding provided that
   a sufficient number of source and repair packets are received.

   For example, one of the most basic FEC schemes is the parity codes,
   where an XOR operation is applied to a group of packets (i.e., source
   block) to generate a single repair packet.  At the receiver side,
   this scheme achieves a full recovery if only one packet is lost
   within the source block and the repair packet is received.  There are
   various other ways of generating repair packets, possibly with
   different error-recovery capabilities.

   The FEC Framework specification states that source and repair packets
   MUST be carried in different streams, which are referred to as the
   source and repair flows, respectively.  At the receiver side, the
   receivers should know which flows are the source flows and which
   flows are the repair flows.  The receivers should also know the exact
   association of the source and repair flows so that they can use the
   correct data to repair the original content in case there is a packet
   loss.  Currently, [RFC3388] and [RFC4756] are used for this purpose.

   In order to provide applications more flexibility, the FEC Framework
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] allows a source flow to be protected by
   multiple FEC schemes, each of which requires an instance of the FEC
   Framework.  Thus, multiple instances of the FEC Framework MAY exist
   at the sender and the receiver(s).  Furthermore, within a single FEC
   Framework instance, multiple source flows MAY be grouped and
   protected by one or more repair flows.

   A basic example scenario is shown in Figure 1.  Here, source flow S1
   is protected by repair flow R1.  Also, source flows S1 and S2 are
   grouped and protected together by repair flow R2.

               SOURCE FLOWS             | FEC FRAMEWORK INSTANCE #1
             | S1: Source Flow |--------| R1: Repair Flow
         +---|
         |   | S2: Source Flow
         |
         +______________________________| FEC FRAMEWORK INSTANCE #2
                                        | R2: Repair Flow

   Figure 1: Example scenario with two FEC Framework instances where R1
            protects S1, and R2 protects the group of S1 and S2

   Grouping source flows before applying FEC protection enables us to
   achieve a better coding performance.  As a typical scenario, suppose
   that source flow S1 and S2 in Figure 1 correspond to the base and
   enhancement layers in a layered video content, respectively.  Repair
   flow R2 protects the combination of the base and enhancement layer
   for the receivers who receive both layers, and repair flow R1
   protects the base layer only, for the receivers who want the base
   layer only, or who receive both layers but prefer FEC protection for
   the base layer only due to a bandwidth and/or processing-power
   limitation.

   Using multiple FEC Framework instances for a single source flow
   provides flexibility to the receivers.  An example scenario is
   sketched in Figure 2.  Different instances may offer repair flows
   that are generated by different FEC schemes and receivers choose
   receiving the appropriate repair flow(s) that they can support and
   decode.  Alternatively, different instances (whether they use the
   same FEC scheme or not) may use larger and smaller source block
   sizes, which accommodate the receivers that have looser and tighter
   latency requirements, respectively.  In addition, different instances
   may also provide FEC protection at different redundancy levels.  This
   is particularly useful in multicast scenarios where different
   receivers might experience different packet loss rates and each
   receiver can choose the repair flow that is tailored to its needs.

           SOURCE FLOWS              | FEC FRAMEWORK INSTANCE #1
           S3: Source Flow |---------| R3: Repair Flow
                           |
                           |---------| FEC FRAMEWORK INSTANCE #2
                                     | R4: Repair Flow

     Figure 2: Example scenario with two FEC Framework instances, each
       with a single repair flow protecting the same source flow S3

   To summarize, the FEC Framework supports the following:

   1.  A source flow MAY be protected by multiple different FEC schemes.

   2.  An FEC scheme MAY generate multiple repair flows.

   3.  Source flows MAY be grouped prior to FEC protection.  That is,
       one or more repair flows MAY protect a group of source flows.

   Unfortunately, the existing specifications ([RFC3388] and [RFC4756])
   have strict requirements that severely limit the use of the
   flexibility that the FEC Framework provides.  In Section 3, we
   describe what is needed by the FEC Framework and the issues with the
   existing specifications.  In Section 4, we propose two solution
   approaches.  The goal of this document is to start discussions around
   this topic and motivate the MMUSIC WG to come up with a solution that
   will address the issues raised here.


2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  FEC Framework Requirements and Issues with the Existing
    Specifications

3.1.  Source and Repair Flow Association

   Currently, the 'group' attribute and the FEC grouping semantics
   defined in [RFC3388] and [RFC4756], respectively, are used to
   associate source and repair flows together.

   The 'group' attribute is used to group multiple repair flows with one
   or more source flows.  However, [RFC3388] prohibits an "m" line
   identified by its 'mid' attribute from appearing in more than one
   "a=group" line using the same semantics.  This limitation prevents us



Begen                    Expires August 17, 2008                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         FEC Grouping Issues in SDP          February 2008


   from indicating specific associations between the source and repair
   flows by using an "a=group:FEC" line per FEC Framework instance.  For
   example, for the scenario sketched in Figure 1, [RFC3388] mandates us
   to write

        a=group:FEC S1 S2 R1 R2

   Clearly, this "a=group:FEC" line does not say anything specific about
   which repair flows are protecting which source flows.  Note that
   source and repair flows are identified by their payload formats
   and/or other descriptors [I-D.ietf-fecframe-sdp-elements].

3.2.  Support for Additivity

   The FEC Framework also supports additive repair flows.  Additivity
   among the repair flows means that multiple repair flows may be
   decoded jointly to improve the recovery chances of the missing
   packets in a single or the same set of source flows.  Additive repair
   flows can be generated by the same FEC scheme or different FEC
   schemes.

   For example, in Figure 4, repair flows R5 and R6 may be additive
   within the FEC Framework instance #1.  Alternatively, all three
   repair flows R5, R6 and R7 could be additive, too.

           SOURCE FLOWS              | FEC FRAMEWORK INSTANCE #1
           S4: Source Flow |---------| R5: Repair Flow
                           |         | R6: Repair Flow
                           |
                           |---------| FEC FRAMEWORK INSTANCE #2
                                     | R7: Repair Flow

    Figure 4: Example scenario with two FEC Framework instances, where
    two repair flows in the first instance and a single repair flow in
            the second instance protect the same source flow S4

   Currently, there is no SDP semantics for indicating additivity among
   the repair flows.

3.3.  Support for Prioritization

   When there are multiple repair flows protecting a single or the same
   set of source flows, the sender MAY assign different levels of
   priority to each repair flow.  The sender uses prioritization to let
   the receivers know in which order the receivers MUST receive and
   decode the repair flows [I-D.ietf-fecframe-sdp-elements].  Note that
   the repair flows that are assigned a priority level may be additive
   or non-additive.

Internet-Draft         FEC Grouping Issues in SDP          February 2008


   A possible scenario where prioritization can be used is that the
   sender generates two repair flows and sends them in two separate
   multicast groups.  It might be highly desirable to keep all the
   receivers in the same multicast group to save from the network
   traffic.  The sender can achieve this by assigning a higher priority
   to one of the repair flows.  Another scenario is where one of the
   repair flows is more expensive in terms of complexity, cost, etc. and
   the sender wants every receiver to use the less expensive repair flow
   first.  This is again possible by using prioritization.  For example,
   in Figure 4, the sender MAY assign a higher priority to repair flow
   R5 and a lower priority to repair flow R6.

   Currently, there is no SDP semantics for indicating the priority
   levels of the individual flows that are grouped in an "a=group" line.
   Instead, within the FEC Framework, the priority of a repair flow is
   described with the optional parameter 'flow-priority' in the "a=fec-
   repair-flow" line [I-D.ietf-fecframe-sdp-elements], which is used to
   describe the individual repair flows.  However, there might be other
   benefits of defining more general semantics for flow prioritization
   in SDP that can be used by other applications and frameworks besides
   FEC Framework.


4.  Solution Approaches

   There are two main solution approaches.

4.1.  New Grouping Attribute

   We can define a new grouping attribute that does not have the
   limitations that [RFC3388] has.  Since we do not obsolete [RFC3388],
   applications using the existing grouping attribute ("a=group") will
   not be affected and the existing grouping semantics can be used
   without any complications.  Furthermore, any application that does
   not understand the new grouping attribute MUST ignore it [RFC4566].
   This will avoid any backward compatibility issue.

   Let the new grouping attribute be "gengroup".  For the scenario
   sketched in Figure 1, we can write

        a=repair-window: 400 ms
        a=mid:R2

   which provides the complete association information.  For the
   definitions of the SDP descriptors specific to the FEC Framework,
   refer to [I-D.ietf-fecframe-sdp-elements].

   For the additivity and prioritization issues, let us consider the
   scenario sketched in Figure 4.  Suppose that repair flows R5 and R6
   are additive but repair flow R7 is not additive with any of the other
   repair flows.  In this case, we can write

        a=gengroup:FEC S4 R5 R6
        a=gengroup:FEC S4 R7

   If none of the repair flows were additive, we could have written

        a=gengroup:FEC S4 R5
        a=gengroup:FEC S4 R6
        a=gengroup:FEC S4 R7

   If the sender wants to assign priority levels to the repair flows,

   the priority order may be indicated with the order of the 'mid'
   values of the repair flows.  However, this approach is potentially
   prone to errors and SHOULD be evaluated carefully whether it covers
   the corner cases or not.

4.2.  New Grouping Semantics

   We can define a new grouping semantics for FEC that does not inherit
   some of the requirements imposed by [RFC3388].  In particular, the
   new grouping semantics should ignore the requirement of having the
   same 'mid' value at most one "a=group" line using the same semantics.

   Let the new grouping semantics be "genFEC".  For the scenario
   sketched in Figure 1, we can write

        v=0
        o=ali 1122334455 1122334466 IN IP4 fec.rocks.com
        s=FEC Grouping Examples - New Grouping Semantics
        t=0 0
        a=group:genFEC S1 R1
        a=group:genFEC S1 S2 R2
        m=video 30000 RTP/AVP 100
        c=IN IP4 224.1.1.1/127
        a=rtpmap:100 MP2T/90000
        a=fec-source-flow: id=0
        a=mid:S1
        m=video 30000 RTP/AVP 101
        c=IN IP4 224.1.1.2/127
        a=rtpmap:101 MP2T/90000
        a=fec-source-flow: id=1
        a=mid:S2
        m=video 30000 RTP/AVP 110
        c=IN IP4 224.1.2.1/127
        a=rtpmap:110 parityfec/90000
        a=fec-repair-flow: encoding-id=0; ss-fssi=1Q2A3Z; rs-fssi=4W5S6X
        a=repair-window: 200 ms
        a=mid:R1
        m=video 30000 RTP/AVP 111
        c=IN IP4 224.1.2.2/127
        a=rtpmap:111 parityfec/90000
        a=fec-repair-flow: encoding-id=0; ss-fssi=123QAZ; rs-fssi=456WSX
        a=repair-window: 400 ms
        a=mid:R2

   Similar to the SDP examples given in Section 4.1, the additive repair
   flows may be listed in the same "a=group:genFEC" line and non-
   additive repair flows may be listed in separate "a=group:genFEC"
   lines.  The priorities of the repair flows may be signaled by the

   same approach that was described in Section 4.1.  However, a similar
   careful consideration SHOULD be given to check the corner cases, one
   example being the case when priorities are assigned to a mix of
   cross-instance additive and non-additive repair flows.
