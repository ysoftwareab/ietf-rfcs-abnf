             A YANG Data Model for Factory Default Settings
                  draft-ietf-netmod-factory-default-15

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model with the "factory-reset" RPC
   to allow clients to reset a server back to its factory default
   condition.  It also defines an optional "factory-default" datastore
   to allow clients to read the factory default configuration for the
   device.

   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in RFC 8342.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model and associated mechanism to
   reset a server to its factory default content.  This mechanism may be
   used, e.g., when the existing configuration has major errors so re-
   starting the configuration process from scratch is the best option.

   A "factory-reset" RPC is defined within the YANG data model.  When
   resetting a device, all previous configuration settings will be lost
   and replaced by the factory default content.

   In addition, an optional "factory-default" read-only datastore is
   defined within the YANG data model, that contains the data to replace
   the contents of implemented read-write conventional configuration
   datastores at reset.  This datastore can also be used in the <get-
   data> operation.

   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture defined in [RFC8342].

Internet-Draft           Factory Default Setting              April 2020


1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8342] [RFC7950] and are not
   redefined here:

   o  server

   o  startup configuration datastore

   o  candidate configuration datastore

   o  running configuration datastore

   o  intended configuration datastore

   o  operational state datastore

   o  conventional configuration datastore

   o  datastore schema

   o  RPC operation

   The following terms are defined in this document as follows:

   o  factory-default datastore: A read-only configuration datastore
      holding a pre-set initial configuration that is used to initialize
      the configuration of a server.  This datastore is referred to as
      "<factory-default>".

2.  Factory-Reset RPC

   A new "factory-reset" remote procedure call (RPC) is introduced.
   Upon receiving the RPC:

   o  All supported conventional read-write configuration datastores
      (i.e. <running>, <startup>, and <candidate>) are reset to the
      contents of <factory-default>.

   o  Read-only datastores receive their content from other datastores
      (e.g., <intended> gets its content from <running>).

Internet-Draft           Factory Default Setting              April 2020


   o  All data in any dynamic configuration datastores MUST be
      discarded.

   o  The contents of the <operational> datastore MUST reflect the
      operational state of the device after applying the factory default
      configuration.

   In addition, the "factory-reset" RPC MUST restore non-volatile
   storage to factory condition.  Depending on the system, this may
   entail deleting dynamically generated files, such as those containing
   keys (e.g., /etc/ssl/private), certificates (e.g., /etc/ssl), logs
   (e.g., /var/log), and temporary files (e.g., /tmp/*).  Any other
   cryptographic keys that are part of the factory-installed image will
   be retained (such as an IDevID certificate) [I-D.ietf-anima-
   bootstrapping-keyinfra].  When this process includes security-
   sensitive data such as cryptographic keys or passwords, it is
   RECOMMENDED to perform the deletion in a manner as thorough as
   possible (e.g., overwriting the physical storage medium with zeros
   and/or random bits for repurpose or end of life (EoL) disposal) to
   reduce the risk of the sensitive material being recoverable.  The
   "factory-reset" RPC MAY also be used to trigger some other resetting
   tasks such as restarting the node or some of the software processes.

   Note that operators should be aware that since all read-write
   datastores are immediately reset to factory default, the device may
   become unreachable as a host on the network.  It is important to
   understand how a given vendor's device will behave after the RPC is
   executed.  Implementors SHOULD reboot the device and get it properly
   configured or otherwise restart processes needed to bootstrap it.

3.  Factory-Default Datastore

   Following the guidelines for defining Datastores in the appendix A of
   [RFC8342], this document introduces a new optional datastore resource
   named "factory-default" that represents a pre-set initial
   configuration that can be used to initialize the configuration of a
   server.  A device MAY implement the "factory-reset" RPC without
   implementing the "factory-default" datastore, which would only
   eliminate the ability to programmatically determine the factory
   default configuration.

   o  Name: "factory-default"

   o  YANG modules: The factory default datastore schema MUST either be
      the same as the conventional configuration datastores, or a subset
      of the datastore schema for the conventional configuration
      datastores.

Internet-Draft           Factory Default Setting              April 2020


   o  YANG nodes: all "config true" data nodes

   o  Management operations: The content of the datastore is set by the
      server in an implementation dependent manner.  The content can not
      be changed by management operations via NETCONF, RESTCONF, the CLI
      etc.  unless specialized, dedicated operations are provided.  The
      datastore can be read using the standard NETCONF/RESTCONF protocol
      operations.  The "factory-reset" operation copies the factory
      default content to <running> and, if present, <startup> and/or
      <candidate> and then the content of these datastores is propagated
      automatically to any other read only datastores, e.g., <intended>
      and <operational>.

   o  Origin: This document does not define a new origin identity as it
      does not interact with the <operational> datastore.

   o  Protocols: RESTCONF, NETCONF and other management protocol.

   o  Defining YANG module: "ietf-factory-default".

   The contents of <factory-default> are defined by the device vendor
   and MUST persist across device restarts.  If supported, the factory-
   default datastore MUST be included in the list of datastores in YANG
   library [RFC 8525].

4.  YANG Module

   This module uses the "datastore" identity [RFC8342], and the
   "default-deny-all" extension statement from [RFC8341].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers one URI in the IETF XML Registry [RFC3688].
   The following registration has been made:

     URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-factory-default
     Registrant Contact: The IESG.
     XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers one YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   Registry [RFC6020].  The following registration has been made:

     name: ietf-factory-default
     namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-factory-default
     prefix: fd
     RFC: xxxx

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document extends the base operations
   for NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF
   layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest

Internet-Draft           Factory Default Setting              April 2020


   RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   Access to the "factory-reset" RPC operation and factory default
   values of all configuration data nodes within "factory-default"
   datastore is considered sensitive and therefore has been restricted
   using the "default-deny-all" access control defined in [RFC8341].

   The "factory-reset" RPC can prevent any further management of the
   device when the server is reset back to its factory default
   condition,e.g., the session and client config are included in the
   factory default contents or treated as dynamic files on the
   nonvoliatile storage and overwritten by the the "factory-reset" RPC.

   The operational disruption caused by setting the config to factory
   default contents or lacking appropriate security control on factory
   default configuration varies greatly depending on the implementation
   and current config.

   The non-volatile storage is expected to be wiped clean and reset back
   to the factory default state, but there is no guarantee that the data
   is wiped according to any particular data cleansing standard, and the
   owner of the device MUST NOT rely on any sensitive data (e.g.,
   private keys) being forensically unrecoverable from the device's non-
   volatile storage after a factory-reset RPC has been invoked.
