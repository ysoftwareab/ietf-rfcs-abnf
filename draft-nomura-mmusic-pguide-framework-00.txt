Abstract

   This memo provides a framework for Internet program guides (IPG). An
   IPG is a set of meta-data describing the features of multimedia
   content in order to subscribe to, manage and exchange multimedia
   content. We present an architecture, a protocol model and program
   guide data model for several scenarios.



1 Introduction

   This document presents a framework for Internet Program Guides (IPGs)
   [1] to facilitate the standardization of protocols and formats.

   Program guides allow users to initiate streaming media sessions,
   schedule delivery of downloadable or multicast content or listen to

   live multicast sessions. A program guide consists of meta-data
   describing the features of multimedia content. Program guides are
   designed to be independent of the particular access network and end
   system. Program guides are generated, modified and processed by
   various network entities. This document describes several such
   architectures.

   This document does not propose or recommend protocols or meta-data
   formats.

2 Terminology

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
   be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

        IPG source: An IPG source is a logical entity that sends program
             guides to one or more IPG receivers.

        IPG receiver: An IPG receiver is a logical entity that receives
             program guides from an IPG source.

        IPG transceiver: An IPG transceiver combines an IPG receiver and
             source.

        Program Guide (PG): A program guide is a set of meta-data
             describing multimedia content. For example, meta-data may
             consist of the URI, title, air time, bandwidth needed, file
             size, text summary, genre, and access restrictions.

3 Program Guide Network Model

3.1 Devices Using the Program Guide

   We assume that any Internet host can be a source of content and meta
   data. Some of the content sources and receivers may only be connected
   to the Internet intermittently. Also, a single human user may use
   many different devices to access meta data, including bandwidth-
   constrained mobile devices. We envision that program guides can be
   sent and received by cellular phones, PDAs (Personal Digital
   Assistant), personal computers, streaming video servers, set-top
   boxes, video cameras, PVRs (Personal Video Recorder), among others.

3.2 Architectures

   This section distinguishes different types of program guide
   interactions.

   A program guide may be exchanged on a one-to-one basis between a
   particular source and receiver. The information may be private or may
   be generated on-demand for one receiver. Figure 1 depicts such an
   exchange.

   Some PG may be distributed to a large number of receivers [3] if a
   particular PG is public information and the provides the same
   information for all receivers. This kind of PG may be distributed
   from one source to multiple receivers (Fig. 2) or may be relayed
   across a set of IPG transceivers that receive the PG, possibly filter
   or modify its content, and then forward it.

   The relayed network architecture is similar to content distribution
   network architecture [4] (CDNs). Existing CDNs may carry PGs.
   Satellite and peer-to-peer networks may also carry PGs.

   A IPG receiver can receive program guides from any number of sources.

            | IPG source  |                | IPG receiver  |

            +-------------+                +---------------+

4 Program Guide Protocol Model

4.1 Unicast

   A client needs to be able to access the PG when convenient. A user
   may delay retrieving the PG until sufficient network bandwidth or
   storage capacity is available.

   In the unicast model, the client retrieves the PG when needed. Here,
   any existing request-response protocols is likely to be sufficient if
   the PG has a well-known name, expressible as a URI or URN.

   If the PG contains a large amount of data, a user may want to request
   a subset of the original PG, selecting only specific items of
   interest.

4.2 Multicast Model

   Instead of requesting the PG periodically, a user may want to simply
   receive updated versions when they become available. Here, multicast
   distribution [5] is an efficient mechanism as long as the PG data
   volume is small.

   Such systems can either multicast the complete PG periodically, or
   multicast only updates, leaving it to the receiver to retrieve the
   initial PG via unicast.

   The multicast model is particularly appropriate for networks with
   natural multicast functionality, such as CATV and satellite systems.

   However, multicast may cause long acquisition delays. For devices
   that are power-constrained or connected via on-demand networks
   (dial-up), PG transmissions may need to be scheduled at well-known
   time instants.

4.3 Synchronized vs. Unsynchronized



Nomura/Schulzrinne                                            [Page 4]

Internet Draft               IPG Framework              October 27, 2002


   PGs tend to change as time elapses, as new content is added, old
   content becomes unavailable and the parameters of existing content
   are changed.

   The IPG source can either simply make updates available
   (unsynchronized) or IPG source and receiver can interact to keep
   their copies of the PG synchronized.

   In the unsynchronized model, the source does not know whether a
   particular receiver has an up-to-date copy of the PG.

5 Program Guide Data Model

   A program guide consists of multiple programs [6], and a program may
   consist of sub-programs called "segments". Each segment is described
   by a set of parameters. Thus, a program guide is structured data.

   PGs can describe multimedia content such as a pictures, music and
   movies. Some of the data elements, such as content owner, time of
   creation and author, are likely to be common across all content,
   while others may depend on the content type and even the genre.

   There are likely to be several data models with differing amount of
   detail and different target audiences. For example, a program guide
   for composing a custom news magazine by network affiliates may be far
   more detailed than the program guide meant for the typical TV viewer.

   PG is used to find, obtain, manage and play content. PG may be
   modified as they are distributed. For example, a media server may use
   a PG to retrieve media content via unicast and then make it available
   at scheduled times via multicast, thus requiring a change of the
   corresponding meta-data.

   IPG transceivers may add or delete information or aggregate PGs from
   different sources. For example, a rating service may add its own
   content ratings or recommendations to existing meta-data.

   A program guide may reference (via URI) to refer other PGs. Such
   references improve flexibility and scalability and simplifies
   decentralized management of PGs. However, it makes update
   notifications somewhat more challenging.

   The same PG may be provided by several different servers.

6 Security Considerations

   Customized PGs may reveal information about the habits and
   preferences of a user and may thus deserve confidentiality

   protection, even though the information itself is public.

   In some cases, the receiver needs to be assured of the origin of a PG
   or its modification history.

   Access to PG information may require authorization.
