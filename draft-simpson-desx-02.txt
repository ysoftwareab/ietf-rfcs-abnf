1.  Introduction

   The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC-1827x] provides confi-
   dentiality for IP datagrams by encrypting the payload data to be pro-
   tected.  This specification describes the ESP use of a variant of the
   Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of the US Data Encryption Standard
   (DES) algorithm [FIPS-46, FIPS-46-1, FIPS-74, FIPS-81].

   This variant, also known as "DESX", processes each block three times,
   each time with a different key [Kaliski96].  The first and last pass
   are a simple and fast XOR.  This was originally proposed by Ron
   Rivest in May of 1984 as a computationally cheap mechanism to protect
   DES against exhaustive key-search attacks.

   Although XOR of a constant value over multiple blocks would not nor-
   mally be considered cryptographically secure, the use of DES-CBC in
   the middle provides a background of highly random internal chaining.
   The XOR values are combined with these random blocks to provide a
   modest improvement in strength.

   For an explanation of the use of CBC mode with this cipher, see [RFC-
   wwww].

   For more explanation and implementation information for DESX, see
   [Schneier95].

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the related
   document "Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"
   [RFC-1825x], that defines the overall security plan for IP, and pro-
   vides important background for this specification.

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST", "recommended",
   "required", and "SHOULD", are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC-2119].


1.1.  Availability

   The DESX algorithm has been previously described in [Kaliski96,
   Schneier95].  This algorithm is not protected by either patent or
   trade secret laws, though the DESX name is a trademark of RSA Data
   Security, a wholly owned subsidary of Security Dynamics Inc.  Trade-
   mark fair-use laws allow vendors to label a product as being compati-
   ble with DESX.  An implementation of DESX is available in RSA's BSAFE
   cryptography toolkit and interoperable implementations have been cre-
   ated outside of the United States.

1.2.  Performance

   The additional computational cost beyond DES is negligible.


2.  Description
2.1.  Block Size

   The US Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm operates on blocks of
   64-bits (8 bytes).  This often requires padding before encrypting,
   and subsequent removal of padding after decrypting.

   The output is the same number of bytes that are input.  This facili-
   tates in-place encryption and decryption.


2.2.  Mode

   The DES-XEX3-CBC algorithm is a simple variant of the DES-CBC algo-
   rithm [RFC-wwww, RFC-1829].

   In DES-XEX3-CBC, the algorithms are an XOR (Xk1), followed by a DES
   encryption (Ek2), followed by another XOR (Xk3), which generates the
   ciphertext (C1) for the block.  Each step uses an independant key:
   k1, k2 and k3.

   To decrypt, the order of the functions is reversed: XOR with k3, DES
   decrypt with k2, XOR with k1.

   Note that when the XOR keys (k1 and k3) are zero, DES-XEX3-CBC is
   equivalent to DES-CBC.  This property allows the DES-XEX3 hardware
   implementations to operate in DES mode without modification.


2.3.  Interaction with Authentication

   There is no known interaction of DES with any currently specified
   Authenticator algorithm.  Never-the-less, any Authenticator MUST use
   a separate and independently generated key.


3.  Initialization Vector

   DES-XEX3-CBC requires an Initialization Vector (IV) that is 64-bits
   (8 bytes) in length.  By default, the IV is carried immediately fol-
   lowing the ESP Sequence Number.

4.  Keys

   The secret DES-XEX3 keys shared between the communicating parties are
   effectively 184-bits long, but are represented as a 192-bit (24 byte)
   quantity.

   The keys consist of three independent quantities: a 64-bit key used
   by an XOR, a 56-bit key used by the DES algorithm, and another 64-bit
   key used by an XOR.  The middle 56-bit key is stored as a 64-bit (8
   byte) quantity, with the least significant bit of each byte used as a
   parity bit.


4.1.  Weak Keys

   DES has 64 known weak keys, including so-called semi-weak keys and
   possibly-weak keys [Schneier95, pp 280-282].  The likelihood of pick-
   ing one at random is negligible.

   However, since checking for weak keys is quite easy, conformant
   implementations MUST test for weak DES keys.

   Moreover, the XOR keys MUST NOT be zero.


4.2.  Manual Key Management

   When configured manually, three independently generated keys are
   required, in the order used for encryption, and 64-bits (8 bytes) are
   configured for each individual key.

   Keys with incorrect parity SHOULD be rejected by the configuration
   utility, ensuring that the keys have been correctly configured.

   Each key is examined sequentially, in the order used for encryption.
   A key that is identical to a previous key MUST be rejected.  The 64
   known weak DES keys MUST be rejected.


4.3.  Automated Key Management

   When configured via a Security Association management protocol, three
   independently generated keys are required, in the order used for
   encryption, and 64-bits (8 bytes) are returned for each individual
   key.

   The key manager MAY be required to generate the correct parity for
   the DES key.  Alternatively, the least significant bit of each key

DRAFT                       ESP DES-XEX3-CBC                   July 1998


   byte is ignored, or locally set to parity by the DES implementation.

   Each key is examined sequentially, in the order used for encryption.
   A key that is identical to a previous key MUST be rejected.  The 64
   known weak DES keys (for the DES key) MUST be rejected.


4.4.  Refresh Rate

   To prevent differential and linear cryptanalysis of collisions [RFC-
   wwww], no more than 2**32 plaintext blocks SHOULD be encrypted with
   the same keys.  Depending on the average size of the datagrams, the
   keys SHOULD be changed at least as frequently as 2**30 datagrams.


Operational Considerations

   The specification provides only a few manually configurable parame-
   ters:

   SPI
      Manually configured SPIs are limited in range to aid operations.
      Automated SPIs are pseudo-randomly distributed throughout the
      remaining 2**32 values.

      Default: 0 (none).  Range: 256 to 65,535.

   SPI LifeTime (SPILT)
      Manually configured LifeTimes are generally measured in days.
      Automated LifeTimes are specified in seconds.

      Default: 32 days (2,764,800 seconds).  Maximum: 182 days
      (15,724,800 seconds).

   Key
      A 64-bit key, a 56-bit key with parity included as appropriate,
      and another 64-bit key, are configured in order as a 192-bit quan-
      tity.

   Each party configures a list of known SPIs and symmetric secret-keys.

   In addition, each party configures local policy that determines what
   access (if any) is granted to the holder of a particular SPI.  For
   example, a party might allow FTP, but prohibit Telnet.  Such consid-
   erations are outside the scope of this document.

Security Considerations

   Users need to understand that the quality of the security provided by
   this specification depends completely on the strength of the DESX
   algorithm, the correctness of that algorithm's implementation, the
   security of the Security Association management mechanism and its
   implementation, the strength of the key [CN94], and upon the correct-
   ness of the implementations in all of the participating nodes.

   The padding bytes have a predictable value.  They provide a small
   measure of tamper detection on their own block and the previous block
   in CBC mode.  This makes it somewhat harder to perform splicing
   attacks, and avoids a possible covert channel.  This small amount of
   known plaintext does not create any problems for modern ciphers.

   It has been shown that DES-XEX3 is substantially stronger than DES
   alone, as it is less amenable to brute force attack with an exhaus-
   tive key search.  When the number of plaintext blocks are limited to
   2**32 as recommended, the time complexity of the idealized random
   permutation block cipher model is increased from an order 2**86 (for
   DES) to 2**134 [Kilian96, Rogaway96].

   It should be noted that real cryptanalysis of DES-XEX3 might not use
   brute force methods at all.  Instead, it might be performed using
   variants on differential [BS93] or linear [Matsui94] cryptanalysis.
   It has been estimated that differential cryptanalysis is increased
   from 2**47 (for DES) to 2**61 chosen-plaintext blocks, and linear
   cryptanalysis is increased from 2**43 (for DES) to 2**60 known-
   plaintext blocks [Kaliski96].  Although these attacks are not consid-
   ered practical, this offers only a small improvement over DES alone.

   It should also be noted that no encryption algorithm is permanently
   safe from brute force attack, because of the increasing speed of mod-
   ern computers.

   As with all cryptosystems, those responsible for applications with
   substantial risk when security is breeched should pay close attention
   to developments in cryptology, and especially cryptanalysis, and
   switch to other transforms should DES-XEX3 prove weak.
