S = 1 indicates that the remaining 7 bits of the octet selects
           one of 128 predefined choices of finite field, element
           representation, elliptic curve, and signature parameters.
           MFMTABZ are omitted, as are all parameters from LP through G.
           LY and Y are retained.

M = 0 if the field is a GF[2^N] field;

M = 1 if the field is a (mod P) or GF[P^D] field with P>2.

FMT = 0  for a (mod P) field.
            > 0  for an extension field, either GF[2^D] or GF[P^D].
                The degree D of the extension, and the field polynomial
                must be specified.  The field polynomial is always monic
                (leading coefficient 1.)

FMT = 1  The field polynomial is given explicitly; D is implied.

A = 1 When P>=5, the curve parameter A is negated.  If P=2, then
A=1 indicates that the A parameter is special.  See the
P=3 is forbidden.

B = 1 When P>=5, the curve parameter B is negated.  If P=2 or 3,
              then B=1 indicates an alternate elliptic curve equation is
              used.  When P=2 and B=1, an additional curve parameter C
              is present.

LA=0 (with no A data field), and sometimes A is 1, which may
Y = X * G (as points on the elliptic curve)

hash = SHA-1 ( data )

R = (the W-coordinate of ( K*G on the elliptic curve ))
             interpreted as an integer, and reduced (mod Q).  (R must
             not be 0.  In this astronomically unlikely event, generate
             a new random K and recalculate R.)

S = ( K^(-1) * (hash + X*R) ) mod Q.

hash = SHA-1 ( data )

Sinv = S^(-1) mod Q.

U1 = (hash * Sinv) mod Q.

U2 = (R * Sinv) mod Q.

V = (the W-coordinate of this point) interpreted as an integer
             and reduced (mod Q).
