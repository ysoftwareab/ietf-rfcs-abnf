        RSVP-TE Summary Fast Reroute Extensions for LSP Tunnels
               draft-mtaillon-mpls-summary-frr-rsvpte-05

Abstract

   This document defines Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Traffic-
   Engineering (TE) signaling extensions that reduce the amount of RSVP
   signaling required for Fast Reroute (FRR) procedures and subsequently
   improve the scalability of the RSVP-TE signaling when undergoing FRR
   convergence after a link or node failure.  Such extensions allow the
   RSVP message exchange between the Point of Local Repair (PLR) and the
   Merge Point (MP) to be independent of the number of protected Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) traversing between them when facility bypass
   FRR protection is used.  The signaling extensions are fully backwards
   compatible with nodes that do not support them.

1.  Introduction

   The Fast Reroute (FRR) procedures defined in [RFC4090] describe the
   mechanisms for the Point of Local Repair (PLR) to reroute traffic and
   signaling of a protected RSVP-TE LSP onto the bypass tunnel in the
   event of a TE link or node failure.  Such signaling procedures are
   performed individually for each affected protected LSP.  This may
   eventually lead to control plane scalability and latency issues under
   limited (memory and CPU processing) resources after a failure that

   affects a large number of protected LSPs traversing the same PLR and
   Merge Point (MP) nodes.

   For example, in a large RSVP-TE LSPs scale deployment, a single LSR
   acting as a PLR node may host tens of thousands of protected RSVP-TE
   LSPs egressing the same link, and also act as a MP node for similar
   number of LSPs ingressing the same link.  In the event of the failure
   of the link or neighbor node, the RSVP-TE control plane of the node
   when acting as PLR becomes busy rerouting protected LSPs signaling
   over the bypass tunnel(s) in one direction, and when acting as an MP
   node becomes busy merging RSVP states from signaling received over
   bypass tunnels for LSP(s) in the reverse direction.  Subsequently,
   the head-end LER(s) that are notified of the local repair at
   downstream LSR will attempt to (re)converge affected RSVP- TE LSPs
   onto newly computed paths - possibly traversing the same previously
   affected LSR(s).  As a result, the RSVP-TE control plane at the PLR
   and MP becomes overwhelmed by the amount of FRR RSVP-TE processing
   overhead following the link or node failure, and the competing other
   control plane protocol(s) (e.g. the IGP) that undergo their
   convergence at the same time.

   The extensions defined in this document enable a MP node to become
   aware of the PLR node's bypass tunnel assignment group and allow FRR
   procedures between PLR node and MP node to be signaled and processed
   on groups of LSPs.  Further, the MESSAGE_ID for the rerouted PATH and
   RESV states are exchanged a priori to the fault such that Summary
   Refresh procedures defined in [RFC2961] can continue to be used to
   refresh the rerouted state(s) after FRR has occurred.

3.  Summary FRR Signaling Procedures

   The RSVP ASSOCIATION object is defined in [RFC4872] as a means to
   associate LSPs with each other.  For example, in the context of
   GMPLS-controlled LSP(s), the object is used to associate recovery

Internet-Draft             RSVP-TE Summary FRR                March 2017


   LSPs with the LSP they are protecting.  The Extended ASSOCIATION
   object is introduced in [RFC6780] to expand on the possible usage of
   the ASSOCIATION object and generalize the definition of the
   Association ID field.

   This document proposes the use of the Extended ASSOCIATION object to
   carry the Summary FRR information and associate the protected LSP(s)
   with the bypass tunnel that protects them.  To this extent, a new
   Association Type for the Extended ASSOCIATION object, and a new
   Association ID are proposed in this draft to describe the Bypass
   Summary FRR (B-SFRR) association.

   The PLR creates and manages the Summary FRR LSP groups
   (Bypass_Group_Identifiers) and shares them with the MP via signaling.
   Protected LSPs sharing the same egress link and bypass assignment are
   grouped together and are assigned the same group.  The MP maintains
   the PLR group assignments learned via signaling, and acknowledges the
   group assignments via signaling.  Once the PLR receives the
   acknowledgment, FRR signaling can proceed as group based.

   The PLR node that supports Summary FRR procedures adds the Extended
   ASSOCIATION object with Bypass Summary FRR Association Type -
   referred to thereon in this document as B-SFRR Extended ASSOCIATION
   object- in the RSVP Path message of the protected LSP to inform the
   MP of the PLR's assigned bypass tunnel, Summary FRR
   Bypass_Group_Identifier, and the MESSAGE_ID object that the PLR will
   use to refresh the protected LSP PATH state after FRR occurs.

   The MP node that supports Summary FRR procedures adds the B-SFRR
   Extended ASSOCIATION object in a RSVP Resv message of the protected
   LSP to acknowledge the PLR's bypass tunnel assignment, and provide
   the MESSAGE_ID object that the MP node will use to refresh the
   protected LSP RESV state after FRR occurs.

   This document also defines a new RSVP FRR_ACTIVE SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS
   object that is sent within the RSVP Path message of a bypass LSP to
   inform the MP node that one or more groups of protected LSPs that are
   being protected by the bypass tunnel are being rerouted i.e.
   signaling is rerouted over the bypass tunnel.

3.1.  Signaling Procedures Prior to Failure

   Before Summary FRR procedures can be used, a handshake MUST be
   completed between the PLR and MP.  This handshake is performed using
   B-SFRR Extended ASSOCIATION object that is carried in both the RSVP
   Path and Resv messages of the protected LSP.

3.1.1.  Extended ASSOCIATION Object

   The B-SFRR Extended ASSOCIATION object is populated using the rules
   defined below to associate the Summary FRR enabled protected LSP with
   the bypass LSP that is protecting it.

   The Association Type, Association ID, and Association Source MUST be
   set as defined in [RFC4872] for the ASSOCIATION Object.  More
   specifically:

   Association Source:

     The Association Source is set to an address selected by the node
     that originates the association. For Bypass Summary FRR association
     it is set to an address of the PLR node.

   Association Type:

     The Association Type is set to indicate the Bypass Summary FRR
     association. A new Association Type is defined as follows:

     Value      Type
     -------    ------
     (TBD-1)    Bypass Summary FRR Association (B-SFRR)

   Extended Association ID:

    The Extended Association ID is populated by the node originating the
    association -- i.e. the PLR for the Bypass Summary FRR association.
    The rules to populate the Extended Association ID in this case is
    described below.

3.1.1.1.  IPv4 Extended Association ID

     Bypass_Group_Identifier: 32 bits

           The bypass tunnel group identifier.

     MESSAGE_ID

           A MESSAGE_ID object as defined by [RFC2961].

   The PLR assigns a bypass tunnel and Bypass_Group_Identifier for each
   protected LSP.  The same Bypass_Group_Identifier is used for the set
   of protected LSPs that share the same bypass tunnel and traverse the
   same egress link and are not already rerouted.  The PLR also
   generates a MESSAGE_ID object (flags SHOULD be clear, Epoch and
   Message_Identifier MUST be set according to [RFC2961]).

   The PLR MUST generate a new Message_Identifier each time the contents
   of the B-SFRR Extended ASSOCIATION object change; for example, when
   PLR node changes the bypass tunnel assignment.

   The PLR node notifies the MP node of the bypass tunnel assignment via
   adding a B-SFRR Extended ASSOCIATION object in the RSVP Path message
   for the protected LSP using procedures described in Section 3.2.

   The MP node acknowledges the PLR node assignment by signaling the
   B-SFRR Extended Association object within the RSVP Resv message of
   the protected LSP.  With exception of the MESSAGE_ID objects, all
   other fields of the received B-SFRR Extended ASSOCIATION object in
   the RSVP Path message are copied into the B-SFRR Extended ASSOCIATION
   object to be added in the Resv message.  The MESSAGE_ID object is set
   according to [RFC2961] with the Flags being clear.  A new
   Message_Identifier MUST be used to acknowledge an updated PLR
   assignment.

Internet-Draft             RSVP-TE Summary FRR                March 2017


   The PLR considers the protected LSP as Summary FRR capable only if
   the B-SFRR Extended ASSOCIATION objects sent in the RSVP Path message
   and the one received in the RSVP Resv message (with exception of the
   MESSAGE_ID) match.  If it does not match, or if B-SFRR Extended
   Association object is absent in a subsequent refresh, the PLR node
   MUST consider the protected LSP as not Summary FRR capable.

3.1.2.  PLR Summary FRR Signaling Procedure

   The B-SFRR Extended ASSOCIATION object is added by each PLR in the
   RSVP Path message of the protected LSP to record the bypass tunnel
   assignment.  This object is updated every time the PLR updates the
   bypass tunnel assignment (which triggers an RSVP Path change
   message).

   Upon receiving an RSVP Resv message with B-SFRR Extended ASSOCIATION
   object, the PLR node checks if the expected subobjects in the B-SFRR
   Extended ASSOCIATION ID are present.  If present, the PLR determines
   if the MP has acknowledged the current PLR assignment.

   To be a valid acknowledgement, the received B-SFRR Extended
   ASSOCIATION object contents within the RSVP Resv message of the
   protected LSP MUST match the latest B-SFRR Extended ASSOCIATION
   object contents that the PLR node had sent within the RSVP Path
   message (with exception of the MESSAGE_ID).

   Note, when forwarding an RSVP Resv message upstream, the PLR node
   SHOULD remove any/all B-SFRR Extended ASSOCIATION objects whose
   Association Source matches the PLR node address.

3.1.3.  MP Summary FRR Signaling Procedure

   Upon receiving an RSVP Path message with an B-SFRR Extended
   ASSOCIATION object, the MP node processes all (there may be multiple
   PLRs for a single MP) B-SFRR Extended ASSOCIATION objects that have
   the MP node address as Bypass Destination address in the Association
   ID.

   The MP node first ensures the existence of the bypass tunnel and that
   the Bypass_Group_Identifier is not already FRR active.  That is, an
   LSP cannot join a group that is already FRR rerouted.

   The MP node builds a mirrored Summary FRR Group database per PLR,
   which is determined using the Bypass_Source_Address field.  The
   MESSAGE_ID is extracted and recorded for the protected LSP PATH
   state.  The MP node signals a B-SFRR Extended Association object
   within the RSVP Resv message of the protected LSP.  With exception of

   Extended ASSOCIATION object in the RSVP Path message are copied into
   the B-SFRR Extended ASSOCIATION object to be added in the Resv
   message.  The MESSAGE_ID object is set according to [RFC2961] with
   the Flags being clear.

   Note, an MP may receive more than one RSVP Path message with the
   B-SFRR Extended ASSOCIATION object from different upstream PLR
   node(s).  In this case, the MP node is expected to save all the
   received MESSAGE_IDs from the different upstream PLR node(s).  After
   a failure, the MP node determines and activates the associated
   Summary Refresh ID to use once it receives and processes the RSVP
   Path message with FRR_ACTIVE SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS object over the
   bypass LSP from the PLR.

   When forwarding an RSVP Path message downstream, the MP SHOULD remove
   any/all B-SFRR Extended ASSOCIATION object(s) whose Association ID
   contains Bypass_Destination_Address matching the MP node address.

3.2.  Signaling Procedures Post Failure

   Upon detection of the fault (egress link or node failure) the PLR
   first performs the object modification procedures described by
   Section 6.4.3 of [RFC4090] for all affected protected LSPs.  For
   Summary FRR LSPs assigned to the same bypass tunnel a common RSVP_HOP
   and SENDER_TEMPLATE MUST be used.

   The PLR MUST signal non-Summary FRR enabled LSPs over the bypass
   tunnel before signaling the Summary FRR enabled LSPs.  This is needed
   to allow for the case when the PLR node has recently changed a bypass
   assignment and the MP has not processed the change yet.

   A new object FRR_ACTIVE SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS is defined in
   Section 3.2.1 and sent within the RSVP Path message of the bypass LSP
   to reroute RSVP state of Summary FRR enabled LSPs.

3.2.1.  SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS Object

   The SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS Object with Type FRR_ACTIVE is carried in the
   Path message of a bypass LSP.  This object is added by the PLR node
   to indicate to the MP node (bypass tunnel destination) that one or
   more groups of protected LSPs that are being protected by the
   specified bypass tunnel are being rerouted over the bypass tunnel.

   The FRR_ACTIVE SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS object is assigned the C-Type (TBD-
   3).  The FRR_ACTIVE SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS object has the below format.

   SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS Class-Num = (TBD-2) (of the form 11bbbbbb) Class-
   Name = SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS Class, FRR_ACTIVE C-Type = (TBD-3)

3.2.2.  PLR Summary FRR Signaling Procedure

   After a failure event, when using the Summary FRR path signaling
   procedures, an individual RSVP Path message for each Summary FRR LSP
   is not signaled.  Instead, to reroute Summary FRR LSPs via the bypass
   tunnel, the PLR adds the FRR_ACTIVE SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS object in the
   RSVP Path message of the RSVP session of the bypass tunnel.

   The RSVP_HOP_Object field of the FRR_ACTIVE SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS object
   is set to the common RSVP_HOP that was used by the PLR in Section 3.2
   of this document.

   The previously received MESSAGE_ID from the MP is activated.  As a
   result, the MP may refresh the protected rerouted RESV state using
   Summary Refresh procedures.

   For each affected Summary FRR group, its Bypass_Group_Identifier is
   added to the FRR_ACTIVE SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS object.

3.2.3.  MP Summary FRR Signaling Procedure

   Upon receiving an RSVP Path message with a FRR_ACTIVE
   SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS object, the MP performs normal merge point
   processing for each protected LSP associated with each
   Bypass_Group_Identifier, as if it received individual RSVP Path
   messages for the LSP.

   For each Summary FRR LSP being merged, the MP first modifies the Path
   state as follows:

   1.  The RSVP_HOP object is copied from the FRR_ACTIVE
       SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS RSVP_HOP_Object field.

   2.  The TIME_VALUES object is copied from the FRR_ACTIVE
       SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS TIMES_VALUE field.  The TIME_VALUES object
       contains the refresh time of the PLR to generate refreshes and
       that would have exchanged in a Path message sent to the MP after
       the failure when no SFRR procedures are in effect.

   3.  The SENDER_TEMPLATE object SrcAddress field is copied from the
       bypass tunnel SENDER_TEMPLATE object.  For the case where PLR is
       also the head-end, and SENDER_TEMPLATE SrcAddress of the
       protected LSP and bypass tunnel are the same, the MP MUST use the
       modified HOP Address field instead.

   4.  The ERO object is modified as per Section 6.4.4. of [RFC4090].
       Once the above modifications are completed, the MP then performs
       the merge processing as per [RFC4090].

Internet-Draft             RSVP-TE Summary FRR                March 2017


   5.  The previously received MESSAGE_ID from the PLR is activated,
       meaning that the PLR may now refresh the protected rerouted PATH
       state using Summary Refresh procedures.

   A failure during merge processing of any individual rerouted LSP MUST
   result in an RSVP Path Error message.

   An individual RSVP Resv message for each successfully merged Summary
   FRR LSP is not signaled.  The MP node SHOULD immediately use Summary
   Refresh procedures to refresh the protected LSP RESV state.

3.3.  Refreshing Summary FRR Active LSPs

   Refreshing of Summary FRR active LSPs is performed using Summary
   Refresh as defined by [RFC2961].

4.  Compatibility

   The (Extended) ASSOCIATION object is defined in [RFC4872] with a
   class number in the form 11bbbbbb, which ensures compatibility with
   non-supporting node(s).  Such nodes will ignore the object and
   forward it without modification.

   The new FRR_ACTIVE SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS object is to be defined with a
   class number in the form 11bbbbbb, which ensures compatibility with
   non-supporting nodes.  Per [RFC2205], the nodes not supporting this
   extension will ignore the object but forward it, unexamined and
   unmodified, in all messages.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document updates an existing RSVP object, and introduces a new
   RSVP object.  Thus, in the event of the interception of a signaling
   message, a slightly more information could be deduced about the state
   of the network than was previously the case.  Existing mechanisms for
   maintaining the integrity and authenticity of RSVP protocol messages
   [RFC2747] can be applied.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters" registry (see
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/gmpls-sig-parameters ).  The
   "Association Type" subregistry is included in this registry.

   This registry has been updated by new Association Type for Extended
   ASSOCIATION Object defined in this document as follows:

   IANA also maintains and assigns the values for the RSVP-TE protocol
   parameters "Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Parameters" (see
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters).

   From this registry, a new RSVP Class (TBD-2) and of the form 11bbbbbb
   and a new C-Type (TBD-3) are requested for the new FRR_ACTIVE
   SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS object defined in this document.

   Class-Number = (TBD-2), Class-Name = SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS

   C-Type = (TBD-3) Name = FRR_ACTIVE
