               SMTP Service Extension for Client Identity
                  <draft-storey-smtp-client-id-04.txt>

Abstract

   This document defines an extension for the Simple Mail Transfer
   Protocol (SMTP) called "CID" to provide a method for clients to
   indicate an identity to the server.

   This identity is an additional token that may be used for security
   and/or informational purposes, and with it a server may optionally
   apply heuristics using this token.

1. Introduction

   The [SMTP] protocol and its extensions describe methods whereby an
   SMTP client may provide identity information to an SMTP server.
   However, every exisitng method for providing an identity is subject
   to limitations, and none offer a way to identify the SMTP client with
   absolute confidence.  This document defines an additional method to
   provide an identity that represents the SMTP client with a higher
   degree of confidence when accessing the SMTP server.

   Typically SMTP clients are identified by establishing an authorized
   connection using the [AUTH] SMTP extension.  SMTP servers are often
   subject to malicious clients attempting to use authorized identities
   not intended for their use (often referred to as a brute- force
   attack).  If such an attack is successful, then the SMTP server may
   not be able to identify the impersonation and be unable to restrict
   such a client.  While there are ways to identify the source of the
   SMTP client such as its IP address or EHLO identity, it would be
   useful if there was an additional way to uniquely identify the client
   solely across an encrypted channel.

   Using the CID extension, an SMTP client can provide a new identity to
   the server called its "client identity".  The client identity can
   provide unique characteristics about the client accessing the SMTP
   service and may be combined with existing identification mechanisms

   in order to identify the client.  An SMTP server may then apply
   additional security policies using this identity such as restricting
   use of the service to clients presenting recognized client
   identities, or only allowing use of authorized identities that match
   previously established client identities.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

2. The CID Service Extension

   The following SMTP service extension is hereby defined:

      (1) The name of this [SMTP] service extension is "Client
          Identity".

      (2) The EHLO keyword value associated with this extension is
          "CID".

      (3) The CID keyword has no parameters.

      (4) A new [SMTP] verb "CID" is defined.

      (5) No parameter is added to any SMTP command.

      (6) This extension is appropriate for the submission protocol
          [SUBMIT].

3. The CID Keyword of the EHLO Command

   The CID keyword is used to tell the SMTP client that the SMTP server
   supports the CID service extension. Though certain conditions must be
   met before the CID keyword can be advertised.

      Conditions:

          An SMTP server MUST NOT advertise the CID keyword in any EHLO
          responses if the CID extension support is not enabled.

          If a connection is not encrypted, an SMTP server SHOULD NOT
          advertise the CID keyword in any EHLO response.

          After a connection is successfully encrypted, an SMTP server
          MUST advertise the CID keyword in all EHLO responses.

4. The CID Command

   The format for the CID command is:

   CID client-id-type client-id-identity

      Arguments:

          client-id-type: A string identifying the identity type the
          client is providing.  It MUST be between 1 and 16 alphanumeric
          characters.

          client-id-identity: A string identifying the client.  It MUST
          be between 1 and 128 printable characters.

      Restrictions:

          A server MUST reject any CID command that is not well
          formatted with a 501 reply.

          An SMTP client MUST only issue the CID command after the SMTP
          server advertises the CID keyword via an EHLO command.  An
          SMTP server MUST reject a CID command prior to advertsing the
          CID keyword via an EHLO command.

          An SMTP client MUST NOT issue any subsequent CID commands
          after a successful CID command in the same session.  An SMTP
          server MUST reject any subsequent CID commands after a
          successful CID command in the same session with a 503 reply.

          An SMTP client MUST NOT issue a CID command unless a TLS/SSL
          session has been negotiated as described in [STARTTLS] or
          through other means such as over a historical SMTP-SSL
          connection.  A server MUST reject any CID command sent after
          establishing an encrypted connection with a 503 reply.

          An SMTP client MUST issue any CID commands prior to issuing
          an [AUTH] command. An SMTP server must reject any CID command
          after receiving an [AUTH] command.

          Several SMTP service extensions such as [AUTH] require that an
          SMTP session be reset to an initial state under conditions
          such as after applying a security layer.  An SMTP server MUST
          discard any CID information after such a reset.

      Discussion:

          An SMTP server MAY choose to require that a successful CID
          command be issued, or that a particular client type be
          presented.  In such a configuration, the server MAY choose to
          reject certain commands or sequences of commands issued by a
          client with a 503 reply.

INTERNET-DRAFT            SMTP Client Identity            August 1, 2017


          An SMTP server MAY reject any CID command with a client type
          that is not supported by the SMTP server with a 504 reply.
          
          An SMTP server SHOULD NOT reject any CID command with a client
          type that is not recognized by the SMTP server.  An SMTP
          server MAY reject during the AUTH command if the CID command
          contained a client type that the server does not support with
          a 504 reply.

          However, the SMTP server MAY accept and discard any client
          identity without issuing a rejection even if it does not
          recognize the client type.  The presented information may be
          useful for analysis.

          An SMTP server MAY reject any CID command that contains a
          client type or client identity that the server chooses not to
          accept for any reason, such as by policy with a 550 reply.

          An SMTP server MAY reject any CID command that contains a
          client type or client identity that the server has chosen to
          disable or revoke use of either temporarily or permanently
          with a 550 reply.

          Since there is historical precedence for SMTP verbs being at
          least 4 characters in length and older SMTP servers checking
          SMTP verbs for this property, an alternate SMTP verb for CID
          that could be used is "ACID".

          In the future there may be a demand for being able to provide
          multiple CID commands with different cid types.

5. Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form notation as specified in [ABNF].  Non-terminals referenced but
   not defined below are as defined by [ABNF].

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
   insensitive.

      client-id-type-char = ALPHA / DIGIT
                          ;; alphanumeric

      client-id-type      = 1*16 client-id-type-char

      client-id-identity  = 1*128 VCHAR
                          ;; any printable US-ASCII character

6. Discussion

6.1 Utility

   The utility of the client identity may be seen by considering the
   following:

      (1) An SMTP client may be present on a device that does not have a
          useful domain name or network address, such as a mobile
          device, so its EHLO identity may be ambiguous;

      (2) An SMTP client may utilize the same SMTP server with multiple
          different authorized identities, so an identity that persists
          across authorized identities is lacking;

      (3) An authorized identity may make use of multiple discrete
          devices over different SMTP sessions, so an identity
          persisting on one device is lacking;

      (4) The SMTP DATA payload does not need to be inspected for this
          identity;

      (5) Connection information, a type of identity, such as network
          address frequently changes.

6.2 Use Cases

   With the client identity the SMTP server has additional information
   it may use in its interactions with the client.  It may:

      (1) Restrict use of an authorized identity to a set of client
          identities, thereby offering an added level of security.  For
          example use of an authorized identity may only be permitted
          from a single device using the client identity as a form of
          whitelisting;

      (2) Identify that the same client identity is used to access
          multiple authorized identities, and restrict access to the
          SMTP service.  For example a client that has successfully
          gained access to many authorized identities may be identified
          through its use of a shared client identity;

      (3) Retain knowledge of client identities previously presented
          with an authorized identity, and if an identity not previously
          seen is used, restrict access to the SMTP service;

      (4) Require that the SMTP client present a token such as a license
          key established outside of the SMTP session in order to make
          use of any authorized identity;

INTERNET-DRAFT            SMTP Client Identity            August 1, 2017


      (5) Apply different security policies to clients that provide a
          client identity versus those which do not.  For example,
          provide clients providing such an identity with additional
          trust.

6.3. Other SMTP Identities

   The [SMTP] protocol and its extensions describe methods whereby an
   SMTP client may provide identity information to an SMTP server.  Some
   of these identities are listed for contrast:

      (1) The client connection source provides an IP address associated
          with the SMTP session;

      (2) The EHLO command allows a client to identify itself with a
          domain or address for an SMTP session;

      (3) The [AUTH] SMTP extension allows the client to establish an

          authorized identity for an SMTP session;

      (4) The MAIL command identifies a specific sender for a mail
          transaction.

7. Client Identity Types

   This document does not specify any identity type that MUST be
   supported.  The MAC and LICENSE types SHOULD be supported, but a
   server MAY not take any actions using the information.

   It is envisioned that in the future it will be useful to propose
   identity types to support.

      (1) MAC

          An SMTP client may find it useful to identify the device using
          which it is establishing the session.  This may be done by
          providing a MAC address.  This provides knowledge that
          persists between different networks and locations yet is
          stable to a physical client device;

      (2) LICENSE

          An SMTP client may find it useful to identify the license key
          of software it is using.  Such licenses are typically crafted
          such that they are unique and useful to identify a software
          installation.

   This document recommends that a server associates a set of flags that 
   describes how the CID command should be handled for any given client 
   identity type.

8. Examples

8.1 MAC Address as Client Identity

   C: [connection established]
   S: 220 server.example.com ESMTP ready
   C: EHLO client.example.net
   S: 250-server.example.com
   S: 250-STARTTLS
   S: 250-AUTH LOGIN
   C: STARTTLS
   S: 220 Go ahead
   C: <starts TLS negotiation>
   C & S: <negotiate a TLS session>
   C & S: <check result of negotiation>
   C: EHLO client.example.net

INTERNET-DRAFT            SMTP Client Identity            August 1, 2017


   C: CID MAC 08:9e:01:70:f6:46
   S: 503 Bad sequence of commands
   C: MAIL FROM:<sender@example.net>
   S: 250 OK
   C: QUIT
   S: 221 server.example.com Service closing transmission channel

   The server rejects use of the CID command as no TLS/SSL session was
   yet established.

8.3 Client Identity Leading to Rejection

   C: [connection established over a plaintext connection]
   S: 220 server.example.com ESMTP ready
   C: EHLO client.example.net
   S: 250-server.example.com
   S: 250-STARTTLS
   C: STARTTLS
   S: 220 Go ahead
   C: <starts TLS negotiation>
   C & S: <negotiate a TLS session>
   C & S: <check result of negotiation>


   C: EHLO client.example.net
   S: 250-server.example.com
   S: 250 CID
   C: CID MAC 08:9e:01:70:f6:46
   S: 550 Server policy does not permit your use of this mail system
   C: QUIT
   S: 221 server.example.com Service closing transmission channel

   The server rejects use of the mail system after deciding that the
   provided client identity does not establish sufficient privileges.

8.4 Malformed CID Command

   C: [connection established over a plaintext connection]
   S: 220 server.example.com ESMTP ready
   C: EHLO client.example.net
   S: 250-server.example.com
   S: 250-STARTTLS
   C: STARTTLS
   S: 220 Go ahead
   C: <starts TLS negotiation>
   C & S: <negotiate a TLS session>
   C & S: <check result of negotiation>
   C: EHLO client.example.net
   S: 250-server.example.com
   S: 250 CID
   C: CID MAC

INTERNET-DRAFT            SMTP Client Identity            August 1, 2017


   S: 501 Syntax error in parameters or arguments
   C: QUIT
   S: 221 server.example.com Service closing transmission channel

   The server rejects the CID command as it is not well formed due to
   there being only a single parameter provided.

9.  Security Considerations

   As this extension provides an additional means of communicating
   information from a client to a server it is clear there is additional
   information divulged to the server.  This may have privacy
   considerations depending on the client identity type or its contents.
   For example, it may reveal a MAC address of the device used to
   communicate with a server that would not previously have been
   revealed.  It is the responsibility of the client to decide whether
   the benefits outweigh the potential security impacts.

   As well, while this service extension requires that the identity
   information only be transmitted over an encrypted channel to reduce
   the risk of eavesdropping, it does not specify any policies or
   practices required in the establishment of such a channel, and so it
   is the responsibility of the client and the server to determine that
   the communication medium meets their requirements.

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1 SMTP Extension Registration

   Section 2.2.2 of [SMTP] sets out the procedure for registering a new
   SMTP extension.

   This extension will need to be registered.
