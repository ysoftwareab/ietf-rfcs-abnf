<h1><br />NERD: A Not-so-novel EID to RLOC Database<br />draft-lear-lisp-nerd-05.txt</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
LISP is a protocol to encapsulate IP packets in order to allow
end sites to multihome without injecting routes from one end of the
Internet to another.  This memo specifies a database and a method to
transport the mapping of EIDs to RLOCs to routers in a reliable,
scalable, and secure manner.  Our analysis concludes that transport of
of all EID/RLOC mappings scales well to at least 10^8 entries.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
<a class='info' href='#I-D.farinacci-lisp'>Locator/ID Separation Protocol
(LISP)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Farinacci, D., Fuller, V., Meyer, D., and D. Lewis, &ldquo;Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> [1] separates an IP
address used by a host and local routing system from the locators
advertised by BGP participants on the Internet in general, and in the default
free zone (DFZ) in particular.  It accomplishes this by establishing a
mapping between globally unique endpoint identifiers (EIDs) and
routing locators (RLOCs).  This
reduces the amount of state change that occurs on routers within
the default-free zone on the Internet, while enabling end sites to be
multihomed.

</p>
<p>
In some mapping distribution approaches to LISP the mapping is learned
via data-triggered control messages between ingress tunnel routers
(ITRs) and egress tunnel routers (ETRs) through
an <a class='info' href='#I-D.fuller-lisp-alt'>alternate routing
    topology<span> (</span><span class='info'>Farinacci, D., Fuller, V., Meyer, D., and D. Lewis, &ldquo;LISP Alternative Topology (LISP+ALT),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> [19].  In other approaches of LISP, the mapping from EIDs
to RLOCs is instead  learned through some
other means. This memo addresses different approaches to the problem,
and specifies a Not-so-novel EID RLOC Database (NERD) and methods to
both receive the database and to receive updates.

</p>
<p>NERD is offered primarily as a way to avoid dropping packets, the
  underlying assumption being that dropping packets is bad for
  applications and end users.  Those who do not agree with this
  underlying assumption may find that other approaches make more
  sense.

</p>
<p>
LISP and NERD are both currently experimental protocols.  The NERD
database is specified in such a way that the methods used to
distribute or retrieve it may vary over time.  Multiple databases are
supported in order to allow for multiple data sources.  An effort has
been made to divorce the database from access methods so that both can
evolve independently through experimentation and operational
validation.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
Base Assumptions</h3>

<p>
In order to specify a mapping it is important to understand how it
will be used, and the nature of the data being mapped.  In the case of
LISP, the following assumptions are pertinent:
<br />
<br />

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The data contained within the mapping changes only on provisioning
or configuration operations, and is not intended to change when a link
either fails or is restored.  Some other mechanism such as the use of
LISP Reachability Bits with mapping replies handles healing operations,
particularly when a tail circuit within an service provider's
aggregate goes down. NERD can be used as a verification method to
ensure that whatever operational mapping changes an ITR receives
are authorized.

</li>
<li>While weight and priority are defined, these are not hop-by-hop
metrics.  Hence the information contained within the mapping does not
change based on where one sits within the topology.

</li>
<li>A purpose of LISP being to reduce control plane overhead by
reducing "rate X state" complexity, updates to the mapping will be
  relatively rare.

</li>
<li>Because LISP and NERD are designed to ease interdomain routing, their use
is intended within the inter-domain environment.  That is, LISP is
best implemented at either the customer edge or provider edge, and
there will be on the order of as many ITRs and EID Prefixes as
there are connections to Internet Service Providers by end customers.

</li>
<li>As such, NERD cannot be the sole means to implement host
mobility, although NERD may be in used in conjunction with other
mechanisms.  For instance, it would be possible for a mobile node to
receive a local address that is an EID and pass that to the
correspondent node, who could also make use of an EID.  As such use of
LISP in this case would be transparent, and no mapping entries are
changed for mobility.

</li>
</ul><p>
<br />
<br />

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
What is NERD?</h3>

<p>
NERD is a Not-so-novel EID to RLOC Database.  It
consists of the following components:
<br />
<br />

</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>a network database format;
</li>
<li>a change distribution format;
</li>
<li>a database retrieval/bootstrapping method;
</li>
<li>a change distribution method.
</li>
</ol><p>
<br />
<br />

The network database format is compressible.  However, at this time
we specify no compression method.  NERD will make use of potentially
several transport methods, but most notably <a class='info' href='#RFC2616'>HTTP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fielding, R., Gettys, J., Mogul, J., Frystyk, H., Masinter, L., Leach, P., and T. Berners-Lee, &ldquo;Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> [2].  HTTP
has restart and compression capabilities.  It is also widely
deployed.

</p>
<p>
There exist many methods to show differences between two versions of a
database or a file, UNIX&#039;s &quot;diff&quot; being the classic
example.  In this case, because the data is well structured
and easily keyed, we can make use of a very simple format for version
differences that simply provides a list of EID/RLOC mappings that have
changed using the same record format as the database, and a list of
EIDs that are to be removed.

</p>
<p>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
        <a class='info' href='#RFC2119'>RFC 2119<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a> [3].

Glossary</h3>

<p>
The reader is once again referred to <a class='info' href='#I-D.farinacci-lisp'>[1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Farinacci, D., Fuller, V., Meyer, D., and D. Lewis, &ldquo;Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> for a general glossary of terms related to LISP.  The following terms
are specific to this memo.

Theory of Operation</h3>

Operational functions are split into two components: database updates
and state exchange between ITR and ETR during a communication.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Database Updates</h3>

<p>
What follows is a summary of how NERDs are generated and updated.
Specifics can be found in <a class='info' href='#MECHANISM'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>NERD Format</span><span>)</span></a>. The general way
in which NERD works is as follows:
<br />
<br />

</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>A NERD is generated by an authority that allocates provider
independent (PI) addresses (e.g., IANA or an RIR) which are used by
sites as EIDs.  As part of this process
the authority generates a digest for the database and signs it with a
private key whose public key is part of an <a class='info' href='#CCITT.X509.1988'>X.509 certificate.<span> (</span><span class='info'>International International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Committee, &ldquo;Information Technology - Open Systems Interconnection - The Directory: Authentication Framework,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1988.</span><span>)</span></a> [15]  That signature
along with a copy of the authority's public key is included in the
NERD.

</li>
<li>The NERD is distributed to a group of well known servers.

</li>
<li>ITRs retrieve an initial copy of the NERD
via HTTP when they come into service.

</li>
<li>ITRs are preconfigured with a group of certificates whose private
keys are used by database authorities to sign the NERD.  This list of
certificates should be configurable by administrators.

</li>
<li>ITRs next verify both the validity of the public key and the
signed digest.  If either fail validation, the ITR attempts to
retrieve the NERD from a different source.  The process iterates until
either a valid database is found or the list of sources is exhausted.

</li>
<li>Once a valid NERD is retrieved, the ITR installs it into both
non-volatile and local memory.

</li>
<li>At some point the authority updates the NERD and increments the
database version counter.  At the same time it generates a list of
changes, which it also signs, as it does with the original database.

</li>
<li>Periodically ITRs will poll from their list of servers to determine
if a new version of the database exists.  When a new version is found,
an ITR will attempt to retrieve a change file, using its list of
preconfigured servers.

</li>
<li>The ITR validates a change file just as it does the original
database.  Assuming the change file passes validation, the ITR
installs new entries, overwrites existing ones, and removes empty
entries, based on the content of the change file.

</li>
</ol><p>
<br />
<br />

As time goes on it is quite possible that an ITR may probe a list of
configured neighbors for a database or change file copy.  It is
equally possible that neighbors might advertise to each other the
version number of their database.  Such methods are not explored in
depth in this memo, but are mentioned for future consideration.

Communications between ITR and ETR</h3>

<p>
<a class='info' href='#I-D.farinacci-lisp'>[1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Farinacci, D., Fuller, V., Meyer, D., and D. Lewis, &ldquo;Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> describes the basic approach to
  what happens when a packet arrives at an ITR, and what
  communications between ITR and ETR take place.  NERD provides an
  optimistic approach to establishing communications with an ETR that
  is responsible for a given EID prefix.  State must be kept, however,
  on an ITR to determine whether that ETR is in fact reachable.

  It is
  expected that this is a common requirement across LISP mapping
  systems, and will be handled in the core LISP architecture.

<a name="rfc.section.2.3"></a><h3>2.3.&nbsp;
Who are database authorities?</h3>

<p>
This memo does not specify who the database authority is.  That is
because there are several possible operational models.  In each case
the number of database authorities is meant to be small so that ITRs
need only keep a small list of authorities, similar to the way a name
server might cache a list of root servers.
<br />
<br />

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A single database authority exists.  In this case all entries in
the database are registered to a single entity, and that entity
distributes the database.  Because the EID space is provider
independent address space, there is no architectural requirement that
address space be hierarchically distributed to anyone, as there is
with provider-assigned address space.  Hence, there is a natural
affinity between the IANA function and the database authority
function.

</li>
<li>Each region runs a database authority.  In this case, provider
independent address space is allocated to either Regional Internet
Registries (RIRs) or to affiliates of such organizations of network
operations guilds (NOGs).  The benefit of this approach is that there
is no single organization that controls the database.  It allows
one database authority to backup another.  One could envision as many
as ten database authorities in this scenario.  One drawback to this
  approach, however, is that any reference to a region imposes a
  notion of locality, thus potentially diminishing the split between
  locator and identifier.

</li>
<li>Each country runs a database authority.  This could occur should
countries decide to regulate this function.  While limiting the scope
of any single database authority as the previous scenario describes,
this approach would introduce some overhead as the list of database
authorities would grow to as many as 200, and possibly more if
jurisdictions within countries attempted to regulate the function.
  There are two drawbacks to this approach.  First, as distribution of
  EIDs is driven to more local jurisdictions, an EID prefix is tied
  even tighter to a location.  Second, a large number of database
  authorities will demand some sort of discovery mechanism.

</li>
<li>Independent operators manage database
  authorities.  This has the appeals of being location independent,
  and enabling competition for good performance.  This method has the
  drawback of potentially requiring a discovery mechanism.

</li>
</ul><p>
<br />
<br />

The latter two approaches are not mutually exclusive.  While this
specification allows for multiple databases, discovery mechanisms are
left as future work.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
NERD Format</h3>

<p>
The NERD consists of a header that contains a database
version and a signature that is generated by ignoring the signature
field and setting the authentication block length to 0 (NULL).  The
authentication block itself consists of a signature and a certificate
whose private key counterpart was used to generate the signature.

</p>
<p>
Records are kept sorted in numeric order
with AFI plus EID as primary key and mask length as secondary.
This is so that after a database update it should be possible to
reconstruct the database to verify the digest signature, which may be
retrieved separately from the database for verification purposes.

<p>
Database Header

</p>
<p>The DB Code indicates 0 if what follows is an entire database or 1
if what follows is an update.
The database file version is incremented each time the complete
database is generated by the authority.  In the case of an update, the
database file version indicates the new database file version, and the
old database file version is indicated in the "old DB version" field.
The database file version is used by routers to determine whether or
not they have the most current database.

</p>
<p>
The database name is a domain name.  This is the name that will appear
in the Subject field of the certificate used to verify the database.
The purpose of the database name is to allow for more than one database.
Such databases would be merged by the router.  It is important that an
EID/RLOC mapping be listed in no more than one database, lest
inconsistencies arise.  However, it may be possible to transition a
mapping from one database to another.  During the transition period,
the mappings MUST be identical.  When they are not, the resultant
behavior will be undefined.

</pre></div>
<p>
Priority N and Weight N, and AFI N are associated with Routing Locator
N.  There will always be at least one routing locator.
The minimum record size for IPv4 is 16 bytes.  Each additional IPv4
RLOC increases the record size by 8 bytes. The purpose of this format
is to keep the database compact, but somewhat easily read.  The
meaning of weight and priority are
described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.farinacci-lisp'>[1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Farinacci, D., Fuller, V., Meyer, D., and D. Lewis, &ldquo;Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.  The format of the
AFI is specified by IANA as "Address Family Numbers", with the
exception of how IPv6 EID prefixes are stored.

</p>
<p>
In order to reduce storage and transmission amounts for IPv6, only the
necessary number of bytes as specified by the prefix length are kept
in the record, rounded to the nearest four byte (word) boundary.  For
instance, if the prefix length is /49, the nearest four-byte word
boundary would require that eight bytes are stored.  IPv6 RLOCs are
represented as normal 128-bit IPv6 addresses.

Database Update Format</h3>

<p>
A database update contains a set of changes to an existing database.
Each AFI/EID/mask-length tuple may have zero or more RLOCs associated
with it.  In the case where there are no RLOCs, the EID entry is
removed from the database.   Records that contain EIDs and mask lengths
that were not previously listed are simply added.  Otherwise, the old
record for the EID and mask length is replaced by the more current
information. The record format used by the a database
update is the same as described in <a class='info' href='#RECORD-FORMAT'>Section&nbsp;3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>NERD Record Format</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.&nbsp;
Initial Bootstrap</h3>

<p>
Bootstrap occurs when a router needs to retrieve the entire database.
It knows it needs to retrieve the entire database because either it
has none or an update too substantial to process, as might be the case
if a router has been out of service for a substantially lengthy period
of time.
</p>
<p>
To bootstrap the ITR appends the database name plus "/current/entiredb" to
a Base Distribution URI and retrieves the file via HTTP.  For example,
if the configured URI is
&quot;http://www.example.com/eiddb/&quot;, and assuming a database
name of "nerd.arin.net", the ITR would request
&quot;http://www.example.com/eiddb/current/nerd.arin.net/entiredb&quot;.
Routers MUST check the signature on the database prior to installing
it, and MUST check that the database schema matches a schema they
understand.  Once a router has a valid database it MUST store that
database in some sort of non-volatile memory (e.g., disk, flash
memory, etc).

</p>
<p>
N.B., the host component for such URIs MUST NOT resolve to a LISP EID,
lest a circular dependency be created.

<a name="rfc.section.4.2"></a><h3>4.2.&nbsp;
Retrieving Changes</h3>

<p>
In order to retrieve a set of database changes an ITR will have
previously retrieved the entire database.  Hence it knows the current
version of the database it has.  Its first step for retrieving changes
is to retrieve the current version of the database.  It does so by
appending "current/version" to the base distribution URI and
retrieving the file.  Its format is text and it contains the integer
value of the current database version.

</p>
<p>
Once an ITR has retrieved the current version it compares version of
its local copy.  If there is no difference, then the router is up to
date and need take no further actions until it next checks.

</p>
<p>
If the versions differ, the router next sends a request for the
appropriate change file by appending &quot;current/changes/&quot; and the
textual representation of the version of its local copy of the
database to the base distribution URI.  For example, if the current
version of the database is 1105503 and router&#039;s version is
1105500, and the base URI and database name are the same as above, the
router would request
&quot;http://www.example.com/eiddb/nerd.arin.net/current/changes/1105500&quot;.

</p>
<p>The server may not have that change file, either because there are
too many versions between what the router has and what is current, or
because no such change file was generated.  If the server has changes
from the routers version to any later version, the server SHOULD issue
an HTTP redirect to that change file, and the router SHOULD retrieve
and process it.  Once it has done so, the router should then repeat
the process until it has brought itself up to date.  It is thus
important for servers to expire old change files in the order in which
they were generated.
</p>
<p>
By way of convention, it is suggested that the URIs issued in
redirects be of the following form:

</p>
<p>
 {base dist. URI}/{dbname}/{more-recent-version}/changes/{older-version}

</p>
<p>where &quot;base dist. URI&quot; is the base distribution URI,
&quot;dbname&quot; is the name of the database, and each version is
the textual representation of the integer version value.

</p>
<p>
For example, if the current database version was 1105503 and a router
made a request for
&quot;http://www.example.com/eiddb/nerd.arin.net/current/changes/1105400&quot;
but there was no change file from 1105400 to 1105503,
and the server had a group of change files to make the router current,
it would issue a redirect to
&quot;http://www.example.com/eiddb/nerd.arin.net/110450/changes/1105400&quot; that the
router would then process.  The router would then make a
request for &quot;http://www.example.com/eiddb/nerd.arin.net/current/changes/110450&quot;
that the server would have.

</p>
<p>
While it is unlikely that database versions would wrap, as they
consists of 32 bit integers, should the event occur, ITRs MUST attempt
first to retrieve a change file when their current version number is
within 10,000 of 2^32 and they see a version available that is less
than 10,000.  Barring the availability of a change file, the ITR MUST
still assume that the database version has wrapped and retrieve a new
copy.

Analysis</h3>

<p>
We will start our analysis by looking at how much data will be
transferred to a router during bootstrap conditions.  We will then
look at the bandwidth required.  Next we will turn our concerns to
servers.  Finally we will ponder the effect of providing only changes.

</p>
<p>In the analysis below we treat the overhead of the database header
as insignificant (because it is).  The analysis should be similar,
whether a single database or multiple databases are employed, as we
would assume that no entry would appear more than once.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1"></a><h3>5.1.&nbsp;
Database Size</h3>

<p>
By its very nature the information to be transported is relatively
static and is specifically designed to be topologically insensitive.
That is, every ITR is intended to have the same set of RLOCs for a
given EID.  While some processing power will be necessary to install a
table, the amount required should be far less than that of a routing
information database because the level of entropy is intended to be
lower.

</p>
<p>
For purposes of this analysis, we will assume that the world has
migrated to IPv6, as this increases the size of the database, which
would be our primary concern.  However, to mitigate the size increase,
we have limited the size of the prefix transmitted.  For purposes of
this analysis, we shall assume an average prefix length of 64 bits.

</p>
<p>
Based on that assumption, <a class='info' href='#RECORD-FORMAT'>Section&nbsp;3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>NERD Record Format</span><span>)</span></a> states
that mapping information for each EID/Prefix includes a group of
RLOCs, each with an associated priority and weight, and
that a minimum record size with IPv6 EIDs with at least one RLOC is
30 bytes uncompressed.  Each additional IPv6 RLOC costs 20 bytes.

gigabytes of RAM for the mapping.  No matter the method of
distribution, any router that sits in the core of the Internet would
require near this amount of memory in order to perform the ITR
function.  Large enterprise ETRs would be similarly strained, 
simply due to the diversity of of sites that communicate with one another.
The good news is that this is not our starting point, but rather our
scaling target, a number that we intend to reach by the year 2050.
Our starting point is more likely in the neighborhood of 10^4 or
10^5 EIDs, thus requiring between 500KB and 17 MB.

The length of time it takes to process the database is
significant in models where the device acquires the entire table.
During this period of time, either the router will be unable to route
packets using LISP or it must use some sort of query mechanism for
specific EIDs as the rest it populates its table through the transfer.
<a class='info' href='#XFERSPEED'>Table&nbsp;2</a> shows us that at our scaling target,
the length of time it would take for a router using 1 mb/s of
bandwidth is about 80 seconds.  We can measure the processing
rate in small numbers of hours for any transfer speed greater than
that.  The fastest processing time shows us as taking 8
seconds to process an entire table of 10^9 bytes and 80 seconds for 10^10

thousand servers.  Should a cold start scenario occur, this number
should be of some concern.  Hence it is important to take some
measures both to avoid such a scenario, and to ease the load should it
occur.  The primary defense should be for ITRs to first attempt to
retrieve their databases from their peers or upstream providers.
Secondary defenses could include data sanity checks within ITRs, with
agreed norms for how much the database should change in any given
update or over any given period of time.  As we will see below,
dissemination of changes is considerably less volume.

<p>This table shows us that with 10,000 servers the average transfer

The amount of change goes to the purpose of LISP.  If its purpose
is to provide effective multihoming support to end customers, then we might
anticipate relatively few changes.  If, on the other, service
providers attempt to make use of LISP to provide some form of traffic
engineering, we can expect the same data to change more often.  We can
probably not conclude much in this regard without additional
operational experience.  The one thing we can say is that
different applications of the LISP protocol may require new and
different distribution mechanisms.  Such optimization is left for
another day.

<a name="rfc.section.5.4"></a><h3>5.4.&nbsp;
Security Considerations</h3>

<p>
Whichever the answer to our previous question, we must consider the
security of the information being transported.  If an attacker can
forge an update or tamper with the database, he can in effect redirect
traffic to end sites.  Hence, integrity and authenticity of the
NERD is critical.  In addition, a means is required to determine
whether a source is authorized to modify a given database.  No data
privacy is required. Quite to the contrary, this information will be
necessary for any ITR.

</p>
<p>The first question one must ask is who to trust to provide the ITR
a mapping.  Ultimately the owner of the EID prefix is most
authoritative for the mapping to RLOCs.  However, were all owners to
sign all such mappings, ITRs would need to know which owner is
authorized to modify which mapping, creating a problem of O(N^2)
complexity.
</p>
<p>
We can reduce this problem substantially by investing
some trust in a small number of entities that are allowed to sign
entries.  If authority  manages EIDs much the same way a domain name
registrar handles domains, then the owner of the EID would choose a
database authority she or he trusts, and ITRs must trust each such
authority in order to map the EIDs listed by that authority to RLOCs.
This reduces the amount of management complexity on the ETR to
retaining knowledge of  O(#authorities),
but does require that each authority establish procedures for
authenticating the owner of an EID.  Those procedures needn't be the
same.

</p>
<p>
There are two classic methods to ensure integrity of data:
<br />
<br />

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>secure
transport of the source of the data to the consumer, such as <a class='info' href='#RFC4346'>Transport Layer Security (TLS)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dierks, T. and E. Rescorla, &ldquo;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [11]; and 
</li>
<li>provide object level security.
</li>
</ul><p>
<br />
<br />


These methods are not mutually exclusive, although one can argue about
the need for the former, given the latter.

</p>
<p>
In the case of TLS, when it is properly
implemented, the objects being transported cannot easily be modified
by interlopers or so-called men in the middle.  When data objects are
distributed to multiple servers, each of those servers must be
trusted.  As we have seen above, we could have quite a large number of
servers, thus providing an attacker a large number of targets.  We
conclude that some form of object level security is required.
</p>
<p>
Object level security involves an authority signing an object in a way
that can easily be verified by a consumer, in this case a router.  In
this case, we would want the mapping table and any incremental update
to be signed by the originator of the update.  This implies that we
cannot simply make use of a tool like <a class='info' href='#CVS'>CVS<span> (</span><span class='info'>Grune, R., Baalbergen, E., Waage, M., Berliner, B., and J. Polk, &ldquo;CVS: Concurrent Versions System,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a> [13].
Instead, the originator will want to generate diffs, sign them, and
make them available either directly or through some sort of content
distribution or peer to peer network.

Use of Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs)</h3>

<p>X.509 provides a certificate hierarchy that has scaled to the
size of the Internet.  The system is most manageable when
there are few certificates to manage.  The model proposed in this
memo makes use of one current certificate per database authority.  The
three pieces of information necessary to verify a signature, therefore,
are as follows:
<br />
<br />

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>the certificate of the database authority, which can be provided
along with the database;

</li>
<li>the certificate authority's certificate; and

</li>
<li>A table of database names and distinguished names (DNs) that are
allowed to update them.

</li>
</ul><p>
<br />
<br />

The latter two pieces of information must be very well known and must
be configured on each ITR.  It is expected that both would change very
rarely, and it would not be unreasonable for such updates to occur as
part of a normal OS release process.

</p>
<p>The tools for both signing and verifying are readily available.
<a href='http://www.openssl.org'>OpenSSL</a> provides tools
and libraries for both signing and verifying.  Other tools commonly
exist.

</p>
<p>
Use of PKIs is not without implementation, operational complexity or
risk.  The following risks and mitigations are identified with
NERD&#039;s use of PKIs:
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>If a NERD database authority private key is exposed:</dt>
<dd>
<br />

In this case an attacker could sign a false database update, either
redirecting traffic, or otherwise causing havoc.  In this case, the
NERD database administrator must revoke its existing key and issue a
new one.  The certificate is added to a certificate revocation list (CRL),
which may be distributed with both this and other databases, as well
as through other channels.  Because this event is expected to be rare,
and the number of database authorities is expected to be small, a
CRL will be small.  When a router receives a revocation, it checks it
against its existing databases, and attempts to update the one that
is revoked.  This implies that prior to issuing the revocation, the
database authority MUST sign an update with the new key.  Routers
SHOULD discard updates they have already received that were signed
after the revocation was generated.  If a router cannot confirm that
whether the authority&#039;s certificate was revoked before or after a
particular update, it MUST retrieve a fresh new copy of the
database with a valid signature.
<br />
<br />


</dd>
<dt>The private key associated with the CA that signed the
Authority&apos;s certificate is compromised:</dt>
<dd>
<br />

In this case, it becomes possible for an attacker to masquerade as the
database authority.  To ameliorate damage, the database authority
SHOULD revoke its certificate and get a new certificate issued from a
CA that is not compromised.  Once it has done so, the previous
procedure is followed.  The compromised certificate can be removed
during the normal operating system upgrade cycle.
<br />
<br />


</dd>
<dt>An algorithm used if either the certificate or the
signature is cracked:</dt>
<dd>
<br />

This is a catastrophic failure and the above forms of attack become
possible.  The only mitigation is to make use of a new algorithm.  In
theory this should be possible, but in practice has proved very
difficult.  For this reason, additional work is recommended to make
alternative algorithms available.
<br />
<br />


</dd>
<dt>The Database Authority loses its key or disappears:</dt>
<dd>
<br />

In this case nobody can update the existing database.  There are few
programmatic mitigations.  If the database authority places its
private keys and suitable amounts of information escrow, under agreed
upon circumstances, such as no updates for three days, for example,
the escrow agent would release the information to a party competent of
generating a database update.

Other Risks</h3>

<p>
Because this specification does not require secure transport, if an
attacker prevents updates to an ITR for the purposes of having that
ITR continue to use a compromised ETR, the ITR could continue to use
an old version of the database without realizing a new version has
been made available.  If one is worried about such an attack, a secure
channel such as SSL to a secure chain back to the database authority
should be used.  It is possible that after some operational
experience, later versions of this format will contain additional
semantics to address this attack.

</p>
<p>As discussed above, substantial risk would be a cold start
scenario.  If an attacker found a bug in a common operating system
that allowed it to erase an ITR's database, and was able to
disseminate that bug, the collective ability of ITRs to retrieve new
copies of the database could be taxed by collective demand.  The
remedy to this is for devices to share copies of the database with
their neighbors, thus making each potential requester a potential
service.

Why not use XML?</h3>

extensibility.  Without a doubt XML would be more extensible than a
fixed field database.  Why not, then, use these
standards in this case?  The greatest concern the author had was
compactness of the data stream.  In as much as this mechanism is
used at all in the future, so long as that concern could be addressed,
and so long as signatures of the database can be verified,
XML probably should be considered.

Other Distribution Mechanisms</h3>

<p>
We now consider various
different mechanisms.  The problem of distributing changes in various
databases is as old as databases.  The author is aware of two obvious
approaches that have been well used in the past.  One approach would
be the wide distribution of CVS repositories.  However, for reasons
mentioned in the previous section, CVS is insufficient to the task.

</p>
<p>
The other tried and true approach is the use
of periodic updates in the form of messages.  <a class='info' href='#RFC0977'>Good old NNTP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kantor, B. and P. Lapsley, &ldquo;Network News Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; February&nbsp;1986.</span><span>)</span></a> [7] itself provides two separate
mechanisms (one push and another pull) to provide a coherent update
process.  This was in fact used to <a class='info' href='#gb91'>update
molecular biology databases<span> (</span><span class='info'>Smith, R., Gottesman, Y., Hobbs, B., Lear, E., Kristofferson, D., Benton, D., and P. Smith, &ldquo;A mechanism for maintaining an up-to-date GenBank database   via Usenet,&rdquo; April&nbsp;1991.</span><span>)</span></a> [14] in the early 1990s.  Netnews offers
a way to determine whether articles with specified Article-Ids have
been received.  In the case where the mapping file source of authority
wishes to transmit updates, it can sign a change file and then post it
into the network.  Routers merely need to keep a record of article ids
that it has received.  Netnews systems have years
ago handled <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet'>far
    greater volume of traffic than we envision.</a>
  Initially this is probably overkill, but it may
not be so later in this process.  Some consideration should be given
to a mechanism known to widely distribute vast amounts of data, as
instantaneously either the sender or the receiver wishes.

</p>
<p>To attain an additional level of hierarchy in the distribution
network, service providers could retrieve information to their own
local servers, and configure their routers with the host portion of
the above URI.
</p>
<p>
Another possibility would be for providers to establish an agreement
on a small set of anycast addresses for use for this purpose.  There
are limitations to the use of anycast, particularly with TCP.  In the
midst of a routing flap anycast address can become all but unusable.
Careful study of such a use as well as appropriate use of HTTP
redirects is expected.

What About DNS as a retrieval model?</h3>

<p>
It has been proposed that a query/response mechanism be used for this
information, and that specifically the <a class='info' href='#RFC1034'>domain
name system (DNS)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mockapetris, P., &ldquo;Domain names - concepts and facilities,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a> [8] be used.  The previous models do not preclude
the DNS.  DNS has the advantage that the administrative lines are well
drawn, and that the ID/RLOC mapping is likely to appear very close to
these boundaries.  DNS also has the added benefit that an entire
distribution infrastructure already exists.  There are, however, some
problems that could impact end hosts when intermediate routers make
queries, some of which were first pointed out in <a class='info' href='#RFC1383'>[9]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huitema, C., &ldquo;An Experiment in DNS Based IP Routing,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1992.</span><span>)</span></a>:
<br />
<br />

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Any query mechanism offers an opportunity for a resource
attack if an attacker can force the ITR to query for information.  In
this case, all that would be necessary would be for a
&quot;botnet&quot; (a group of computers that have been compromised
and used as vehicles to attack others) to ping or otherwise contact
via some normal
service hosts that sit behind the ETR.  If the botnet hosts themselves
are behind ETRs, the victim&#039;s ITR will need to query for each and
every one of them, thus becoming part of a classic reflector attack.
</li>
<li>Packets will be delayed at the very least, and probably dropped
in the process of a mapping query.  This could be at the beginning of
a communication, but it will be impossible for a router to conclude
with certainty that this is the case.

</li>
<li>The DNS has a backoff algorithm that presumes that applications are
making queries prior to the beginning of a communication.  This is
appropriate for end hosts who know in fact when a communication
begins.  An end user  may not enjoy a router waiting seconds for a retry.

</li>
<li>While the administrative lines may appear to be correct, the
location of name servers may not be.  If name servers sit within PI
address space, thus requiring LISP to reach, a circular dependency is
created.  This is precisely where many enterprise name servers sit.
The LISP experiment should not predicate its success on relocation of
such name servers.

</li>
</ul><p>
<br />
<br />

Never-the-less, DNS may be able to play a role in providing the
enterprise control over the mapping of its EIDs to RLOCs.  Posit a new
DNS record &quot;EID2RLOC&quot;.  This record is used by the authority
to collect and aggregate mapping information so that it may be
distributed through one of the other mechanisms.  As an example:

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
   $ORIGIN 0.10.PI-SPACE.
    128   EID2RLOC   mask 23 priority 10 weight 5 172.16.5.60
          EID2RLOC   mask 23 priority 15 weight 5 192.168.1.5

</pre></div>
<p>
In the above figure network 10.0.128/23 would delegated to some
end system, say EXAMPLE.COM.  They would manage the above zone
information.   This would allow a DNS mechanism to work, but it would
also allow someone to aggregate the information and distribution a
table.

Use of BGP and LISP+ALT</h3>

<p>
<a class='info' href='#RFC4271'>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rekhter, Y., Li, T., and S. Hares, &ldquo;A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4),&rdquo; January&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [10] is
currently used to distribute inter-domain routing throughout the
Internet.  Why not, then, use BGP to distribute mapping entries, or
provide a rendezvous mechanism to initialize mapping entries?
In fact this is precisely
what <a class='info' href='#I-D.fuller-lisp-alt'>LISP+ALT<span> (</span><span class='info'>Farinacci, D., Fuller, V., Meyer, D., and D. Lewis, &ldquo;LISP Alternative Topology (LISP+ALT),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> [19] accomplishes,
using a completely separate topology from the normal DFZ.  It does so
  using existing code paths and expertise.  The alternate topology
  also provides an extremely accurate control path from ITRs to
  ETRs, whereas NERD&#039;s operational model requires an optimistic
  assumption and control plane functionality to cycle through
  unresponsive ETRs in an EID prefix&#039;s mapping entry.  The
  memory scaling characteristics of LISP+ALT are extremely attractive
  because of expected strong aggregation, whereas NERD makes almost no
  attempt at aggregation.

</p>
<p>
  A number of key deployment issues are left open.  The principle
  issue is whether it is deemed acceptable for routers to drop packets
  occasionally while mapping information is being gathered.  This
  should be the subject of future research for ALT, as it was a key
  design goal of NERD to avoid such a situation.

<a name="rfc.section.7.3"></a><h3>7.3.&nbsp;
Perhaps use a hybrid model?</h3>

<p>
Perhaps it would be useful to use both a prepopulated database such as NERD
and a query mechanism (perhaps LISP+ALT, <a class='info' href='#I-D.meyer-lisp-cons'>LISP-CONS<span> (</span><span class='info'>Brim, S., &ldquo;LISP-CONS: A Content distribution Overlay Network Service for LISP,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [20], or DNS) to determine an
EID/RLOC mapping.  One idea would be to receive a subset of
the mappings, say, by taking only the NERD for certain regions.  This
alleviates the need to drop packets for some subset of destinations
under the assumption that one&#039;s business is localized to a
particular region.  If one did not have a local entry for a particular
EID one would then make a query.
</p>
<p>One approach to using DNS to query live would be to
  periodically walk &quot;interesting&quot; portions of the  network, in
  search of relevant records, and caching them to non-volatile
  storage.  While preventing resource attacks, the walk itself could
  be viewed as an attack, if the algorithm was not selective enough
  about what it thought was interesting.  A similar approach could be
  applied to LISP+ALT or LISP-CONS by forcing a data-driven
  Map Reply for certain sites.

Deployment Issues</h3>

<p>
While LISP and NERD are intended as experiments at this point, it is
already obvious one must give serious consideration to circular
dependencies with regard to the protocols used and the elements within
them.

<a name="rfc.section.8.1"></a><h3>8.1.&nbsp;
HTTP</h3>

<p>

  In as much as HTTP depends on DNS, either
due to the authority section of a URI, or due to the configured base
distribution URI, these same concerns apply.  In addition, any HTTP
server that itself makes use of provider independent addresses would
be a poor choice to distribute the database for these exact same
reasons.

</p>
<p>One issue with using HTTP is that it is possible that a middlebox
of some form, such as a cache, may intercept and process requests.  In
some cases this might be a good thing.  For instance, if a cache
correctly returns a database, some amount of bandwidth is conserved.
On the other hand, if the cache itself fails to function properly for
whatever reason, end to end connectivity could be impaired.  For
example, if the cache itself depended on the mapping being in place
and functional, a cold start scenario might leave the cache
functioning improperly, in turn providing routers no means to update
their databases.  Some care must be given to avoid such circumstances.

Open Questions</h3>

<p>
  Do we need to discuss reachability in more detail?  This was
  clearly an issue at the IST-RING workshop.  There are two key
  issues.  First, what is the appropriate architectural separation
  between the data plane and the control plane?  Second, is there some
  specific way in which NERD impacts the data plane?

</p>
<p>Should we specify a (perhaps compressed) tarball that treads a
middle ground for the last question, where each update tarball
contains both a signature for the update and for the entire database,
once the update is applied.

</p>
<p>
Should we compress?  In some initial testing of databases with 1, 5,
and 10 million IPv4 EIDs and a random distribution of IPv4 RLOCs, the
current format in this document compresses down by a factor of between
35% and 36%, using  Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text compression
algorithm (bzip2).  The NERD used random EIDs with mask lengths
varying from 19-29, with probability weighted toward the smaller
masks.  This only very roughly reflects reality.  A better test would
be to start with the existing prefixes found in the DFZ.

Conclusions</h3>

<p>
This memo has specified a database format, an update format, a URI
convention, an update method, and a validation method for EID/RLOC
mappings.  We have shown that beyond the predictions of 10^8
EID-prefix entries,
the aggregate database size would likely be at most 17GB.  We have
considered the amount of servers to distribute that information and we
have demonstrated the limitations of a simple content distribution
network and other well known mechanisms.
The effort required to retrieve a database change amounts to between 3
and 30 seconds of processing time per hour at at
today&#039;s gigabit speeds.  We conclude that there is no need for an
off box query mechanism today, and that there are distinct
disadvantages for having such a mechanism in the control plane.

</p>
<p>Beyond this we have examined alternatives that allow for hybrid
models that do use query mechanisms, should our operating assumptions
prove overly optimistic.  Use of NERD today does not foreclose use of
such models in the future, and in fact both models can happily
co-exist.

</p>
<p>
We leave to future work how the list of databases is distributed, how
BGP can play a role in distributing knowledge of the databases, and
how DNS can play a role in aggregating information into these
databases.

</p>
<p>
We also leave to future work whether HTTP is the best protocol for the
job, and whether the scheme described in this document is the most
efficient.  One could easily envision that when applied in high delay
or high loss environments, a broadcast or multicast method may prove
more effective.

</p>
<p>
Speaking of multicast, we also leave to future work how multicast is
implemented, if at all, either in conjunction or as an extension to
this model.

<a name="rfc.section.A"></a><h3>Appendix A.&nbsp;
Generating and verifying the database signature with
  OpenSSL</h3>

<p>As previously mentioned, one goal of NERD was to use
  off-the-shelf tools to both generate and retrieve the database.  To
  many, PKI is magic.  This section is meant to provide at least some
  clarification as to both the generation and verification process,
  complete with command line examples.  Not included is how you get
  the entries themselves.  We'll assume they exist, and that you're
  just trying to sign the database.
  
</p>
<p>
  To sign the database, to start with, you need a database file that
  has a database header described in <a class='info' href='#MECHANISM'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>NERD Format</span><span>)</span></a>.  Block
  size should be zero, and there should be no PKCS#7 block at this
  point.  You also need a certificate and its private key with which
  you will sign the database.
  
</p>
<p>
  The OpenSSL &quot;smime&quot; command contains all the functions we
  need from this point forth.  To sign the database, issue the
  following command:
  
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

      openssl smime -binary -sign -outform DER -signer yourcert.crt \
              -inkey yourcert.key -in database-file -out signature


</pre></div>
<p>
   -binary states that no MIME canonicalization should be performed.
   -sign indicates that you are signing the file that was given as the
   argument to -in.  The output format (-outform) is binary DER, and
   your public certificate is provided with -signer along with your
   key with -inkey.  The signature itself is specified with -out.
   
</p>
<p>The resulting file &quot;signature&quot; is then copied into to
   PKCS#7 block in the database header, its size in bytes is
   recorded in the PKCS#7 block size field, and the resulting file is
   ready for distribution to ITRs.
   
</p>
<p>
   To verify a database file, first retrieve the PKCS#7 block from the
   file by copying the appropriate number of bytes into another file,
   say &quot;signature&quot;.  Next, zero this field, and set the block
   size field to 0.  Next use the &quot;smime&quot; command to verify
   the signature as follows:
   
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

    openssl smime -binary -verify -inform DER -content database-file
            -out /dev/null -in signature


</pre></div>
<p>Openssl will return &quot;Verification OK&quot; if the signature is
correct.  OpenSSL provides sufficiently rich libraries to accomplish
  the above within the C programming language with a single pass.
