                   BGP Link-Local Next Hop Capability
               draft-kumar-idr-link-local-nexthop-02.txt

Abstract

   This document proposes a new BGP capability to allow route resolution
   over IPv6 link-local next hop.  It eliminates the requirement of
   assigning a global IPv6 address for the next hop.

1.  Introduction

   BGP [RFC4271] implementations support peering over link-local IPv6
   addresses [RFC4291].  However, for the prefixes advertised over such
   a peering the resulting next hop attribute and route installation is
   still dependent on the Next Hop carrying a global IPv6 address.  For
   the deployments where next hops need not have a scope beyond the
   peering link, the configuration can be simplified by lifting the
   requirement that the Next Hop field carry a global IPv6 address.

   While the current proposal has no dependency on the link-local
   peering (e.g. link-local next hops could be used over ipv4 peering
   too), the use case with link-local peering offers clear advantages.
   Link-local peering already mandates an interface to be attached
   explicitly with the neighbor configuration.  With the negotiation of
   the proposed capability, a BGP speaker sends link-local addresses as

   the only IPv6 next hop address.  Correspondingly, the receiving peer
   resolves the routes in the context of the peering interface.

   Many large modern data-center networks that are based on topologies
   such as CLOS tend to be rather symmetric, and the BGP deployment in
   such networks do not require next hops to have relevance across
   peerings.  Such BGP deployment models require BGP to run on each
   link, and any ease or simplification of BGP configuration can result
   in simplifying orchestration and configuration management.  This
   proposal is a step in that direction.

   With the requirement of any global interface address being removed by
   this new capability, BGP neighbor configuration can be further
   simplified by making it (look) address-family independent.  E.g BGP
   can just take interface name for the peer config and link-local IPv6
   address of the peer can be learned via a discovery protocol running
   on the link or by an out-of-band tool.  In essence, link-local next
   hop in combination with [RFC5549] makes it possible to achieve an
   unnumbered interface-like solution [RFC5309] in BGP.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Link-Local Next Hop Capability

   The LINK-LOCAL-ONLY-NEXT-HOP capability is a new BGP capability.  A
   BGP speaker that supports capabilities advertisement [RFC5492] in an
   OPEN message should send this capability only when:

   1.  It is capable of sending link-local IPv6 address as the only next
       hop address for a route.

   2.  The implementation is capable of processing link-local address
       next hops with the help of peer interface binding to come up with
       interface specific next hops for its routing table.

   The presence of this capability does not affect the support of global
   IPv6 only (16 bytes next hop) and global IPv6 combined with link-
   local IPv6 (32 bytes next hop), which should continue to be supported
   as before.

   The Capability Code for this capability is specified in the IANA
   Considerations section of this document.  The Capability Length field
   of this capability is 0.

3.  Constructing the Next Hop field

   Section 3 of [RFC2545] standardizes IPv6 next-hop construction.  Here
   we suggest modifications required for link-local next hop
   construction.

   A BGP speaker shall advertise to its peer in the Network Address of
   Next Hop field the link-local IPv6 address of the next hop.

   The value of the Length of Next Hop Network Address field on a
   MP_REACH_NLRI attribute shall be set to 16.

   For iBGP peers configured as a route-reflector, when route-reflector
   isn't configured to be in the data-path, the proposed link-local
   (only) next hops MUST not be reflected.

   In general, implementations should not relay the link-local only next
   hop.  Implementations supporting this capability should provide a way
   to handle the relay of link-local only next hops over point-to-point
   links (route-reflector and EBGP-to-IBGP cases) by either:

   o  an implicit next-hop-self.

   o  providing a configuration to enable next-hop-self.  In this case,
      the link-local next hop MUST not be relayed, if this knob is not
      enabled.

   Note: On a route-reflector, when source of link-local only next hop
   and route-reflector client are on the same broadcast segment, then
   implicit next-hop-self should not be done.  Same goes for eBGP to
   iBGP scenarios.

4.  Operation

   A BGP speaker that is willing to use (send and receive) only link-
   local addresses as next hops with a peer SHOULD advertise the LINK-
   LOCAL-ONLY-NEXT-HOP Capability to the peer using BGP Capabilities
   advertisement.

   [draft-kato] recommended implementations to ignore the ipv6 global
   next hop if it didn't match any of the link's global addresses.  The
   proposal has the following limitations:

   o  It results in poor error handling, specifically for next hop
      validation.

   o  It does not allow the sender to set a global next hop value that
      is _not_ one of the assigned prefixes on the link.

   o  It does not specify the behavior for IBGP sessions.

   o  A global next hop field has to be always present in the UPDATE
      messages.

   We formalize this idea with the proposed new capability, so that the
   peers have the flexibility to include both link-local and global next
   hops or link-local only next hop.  The error handling of messages is
   not compromised.

5.  Deployment Considerations

   The usage of this capability is restricted to the cases where the
   scope of the next hop is limited to the peering interface.  This
   restriction comes from the fact that link-local IPv6 addresses are
   link-scoped, therefore link-local address of the one peer can not be
   used as next hop if its to be carried with the updates over another
   peer.

6.  Acknowledgments

   We would like to thank Daniel Walton for his comments and
   suggestions.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new link-local next hop capability.  IANA is
   requested to assign a capability number to the same.

8.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security risks introduced by this design.
