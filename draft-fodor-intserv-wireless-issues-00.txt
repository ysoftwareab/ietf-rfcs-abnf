ABSTRACT

   We consider a scenario wherein a QoS enabled application uses an
   Integrated Services based API (IntServ).  Where the network
   interface is over a cellular wireless access network, we examine the
   feasibility of the radio management function to establish
   appropriate spectrum efficient bearers to support the requested
   service.

   We conclude that only the Controlled Load Service can be reasonably
   supported over a cellular wireless access network with the required
   spectrum efficiency.  However, even for the CL service, some
   additional service parameters are needed in the IntServ model to
   allow the derivation of the necessary wireless parameters for
   spectrum efficient operation.

2   General Background

   One of the key objectives in the evolution and standardization of
   various radio access technologies (as in 3G [3G-1, 3G-2]) is to
   offer QoS support for a variety of services, including IP services,
   while considering the critical aspects for wireless networks of
   optimizing spectrum efficiency.

   In an end-to-end path containing one or more wireless links, it is
   expected that the wireless links will be the most critical for QoS
   delivery.  Thus, the end-to-end service will be mainly influenced by
   the suitability of the provided wireless link characteristics.

   One of the challenges in the design of QoS services, such as those
   specified by IntServ, is that they must be able to be supported
   effectively by a variety of link layers and QoS mechanisms,
   including those used by wireless access networks.

   It is believed that platforms supporting multiple interface types
   will provide generic (non-interface specific) QoS APIs to
   applications.  Since an IntServ based API is expected to be widely
   available to application developers on some of these platforms, it
   is useful to ensure that spectrum efficient radio services can be
   provided for applications requesting QoS through an IntServ API.

                         on wireless accesses

   In this draft we focus on an IntServ enabled application/host
   requesting QoS through such an API, and investigate the feasibility
   of managing radio resources to provide spectrum efficient support
   for the requested service over a wireless access network.

   The draft is organized as follows.  Section 2 describes the all-IP
   3G architecture and the main functionalities of the wireless network
   elements.  It also summarizes the aspects of radio access networks
   (described in detail in Appendix A) that are important to consider
   when evaluating the suitability of radio bearers to support the
   requested service.  Section 3 examines the feasibility to provide
   appropriate spectrum efficient radio bearers for the individual
   IntServ Services and identifies some key issues for operating over a
   wireless access network.

   The Appendix develops a model for the radio access network, and
   describes the radio mechanisms available to vary the QoS
   characteristics of the radio bearer services.  It also details a set
   of radio parameters that may be available to control those
   mechanisms.

3   Wireless Network architecture and characteristics

   In this context, the term _all-IP architecture_ is often used to
   indicate that the IP layer is present in the mobile terminal and
   that the user may establish an IP connection to other IP endpoints
   through an IP network.  In an all-IP network, a typical scenario
   includes the following elements:

   o  The terminal equipment (UE) is considered to include the physical
      device connecting to the Wireless Access Network (WAN), as well
      as any additional equipment provided with service through this
      connection (e.g. a mobile terminal and a PC attached to it with a
      bluetooth connection).
   o  The Wireless Access Network (WAN) that consists of base stations
      (BS), base station controllers BSC, (also referred to as radio
      network controllers, RNC) and possibly other nodes responsible
      for mobility management, location management, etc.  The WAN
      connects to the external IP Network (e.g. The Internet) through
      (a) gateway node(s) (WAN GW). It is important to note that the
      WAN appears to the UE as a L2 network; and is designed and
      optimized for the transmission of radio packets.

   The radio packet delivery service (associated with a specific set of
   traffic and QoS characteristics) that is provided by the WAN is
   often referred to as the radio access bearer service (RABS).  For
   instance, a streaming RABS may mean a radio packet delivery service
   provided by the WAN that provides bounded delay and limited packet
   loss ratio.  The set of radio level entities that realize the RABS
   are referred to as radio channels or radio bearers.

   A simplified diagram of the communication within an all-IP wireless
   network is shown by Figure 2.  An application in the UE uses an
   IntServ based API to request QOS service.

   With the 3G all-IP network, the terminal equipment has the
   responsibility for identifying the radio bearers that it needs, and
   how it will use them.  Thus, it is responsible for initiating the
   radio bearers between the UE and the WAN GW.  Here we are examining
   a scenario where the UE makes use of the IntServ service information
   in determining the appropriate radio bearers to establish.

   The WAN provides radio access bearer services to support the layer 2
   connection between the UE and the WAN GW.  The characteristics of
   these bearer services are dependent on the wireless mechanisms, and
   can be markedly different from bearer services in traditional wired
   networks.

   The appendix describes a model for the radio access bearer services
   that can be provided by a wireless access.  It then goes on to show
   how parameters of the radio bearer service can be used to change its
   characteristics.

   Using the model as defined in the appendix, it is clear that
   different radio bearer services can be provided, resulting in quite
   different characteristics of QoS, service costs and service
   behaviors.  A consequence of this flexibility is that sufficient
   detail about the applications' traffic and service requirements must
   be known in order to determine the appropriate parameter settings to
   enable service optimization..

   In wireless networks, the physical resources (e.g. frequency
   spectrum, transmission power or time slots) are typically scarce.
   The transmission is therefore optimized in order to utilize the
   resources as efficiently as possible.

   For example, one optimization is to maximize the total throughput
   [kbps/MHz/cell] of a system for a given service quality.  Another
   optimization is to maximize the number of admitted users for a given
   service quality level [Erlang/cell].  The number of admitted users
   is essential for the revenues of the operators.  On the other hand,
   when increasing the number of users, the overhead and interference
   levels are increased.  Since the resources are shared between the
   users, there is a trade-off between the number of users in the cell
   and the bit rate and service quality level that can be offered to
   each user.

   The realization offering the best resource utilization and service
   cost is normally used.  Since service cost and spectrum efficiency
   are crucial in wireless networks, the radio bearer services selected
   should be aimed to just meet (not to exceed) the actual QoS
   requirements.

INTERNET DRAFT     Application of IntServ Services    Expires Jan 2002
                         on wireless accesses

   The appendix identifies a detailed range of characteristics that
   could be controlled in radio bearer services.  For evaluating the
   suitability of radio bearers to support current Integrated Service
   definitions, we summarize the characteristics of the radio bearer
   services as follows:

   o  A radio bearer service (and the corresponding radio channel)
      providing minimum delay would not have retransmission at the
      radio layer, and could have minimal error correction codes and
      interleaving.  This could result in high bit error rates.
   o  Reliability can be improved through several parameters.  Radio
      channels typically have a trade-off in one or more
      characteristics, such as delay (e.g. from interleaving, FEC,
      ARQ), spectrum usage (e.g. from FEC) or number of users that can
      be supported (e.g. from signal power).

   Optimal use of the network resources needs sufficient information
   about the service usage to identify the most appropriate setting of
   the range of parameters.  For example, a telephony application using
   an AMR codec would be well supported by a radio bearer that provides
   minimal delay, even if the error rate is quite high.  Alternatively,
   another application may require low delay, but may not tolerate a
   high error rate, so the power level and FEC may be different.

4   Examination of Existing Integrated Services

   Integrated Services enhance the single best-effort service paradigm
   by introducing multiple services.  IntServ allows the network nodes
   to perform explicit resource management at the IP level by allowing
   applications to characterize their resource requirements.  IntServ
   requests allow the nodes to exercise admission control and traffic
   control and thereby provide end-to-end QoS provisioning and resource
   allocation.

   An end-to-end service may traverse a number of QoS domains.  We are
   only concerned here with the feasibility to establish spectrum
   efficient (L2) radio bearers to support the service request as it
   applies to the radio bearer link (i.e. between the UE and the WAN
   GW).  Issues with support of the service requirements over the end-
   to-end path are outside the scope of this document.



4.1   Guaranteed Quality of Service (GQoS)

   The Guaranteed Quality of Service [RFC2212] Integrated Service is
   defined to provide a service of guaranteed bandwidth with a bounded
   queuing delay.  The end-to-end behavior provided by a series of
   network elements provides an assured level of bandwidth that, when
   used by a policed flow, produces a delay-bounded service with no
   queuing loss for all conforming packets (assuming no failure of
   network components or changes in routing during the life of the
   flow).

Fodor, Persson, Williams                                      [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT     Application of IntServ Services    Expires Jan 2002
                         on wireless accesses


   The GQoS service expects constant bandwidth and a low loss rate,
   since loss is normally expected to result from congestion which GQoS
   would minimize since it reserves resources.  For wireless networks,
   the bit error rate is much higher, and is influenced by many
   different factors including path loss, fading and interference (see
   Appendix A).  These are most likely to change when the user is
   moving, but may also vary even when the user is stationary.  It is
   difficult to meet both the low loss and constant data rate
   expectations of the GQoS service given the variation in radio
   channel performance.

   GQoS permits the user to increase the bandwidth of the service to
   control the queuing delay, as this was typically the only variable
   in end-to-end delay of a best-effort network.  For public cellular
   wireless networks, it is important to be able to provide service to
   as many customers as possible, so service charges are typically
   dependent on the service.  Thus, although it may be technically
   feasible for the UE to request greater bandwidth than the traffic
   needs to meet the service requirements, it is not cost effective to
   do so, and thus must be avoided.

   A wireless network is one which can have a wide variation in delay
   dependent on the radio bearer service (consider the transmission
   model described in the appendix).  Information about the delay and
   delay variation for the service can be provided to the end host.
   The worst case delay variation (the difference between the minimum
   delay the network can support, and the maximum that could occur) for
   radio bearer services is dependent on the bearer characteristics
   (e.g. retransmissions), and thus can be extremely large. Hence, the
   reported delay variation is not beneficial in determining the
   required bandwidth.

   Finally, there is insufficient information in the GQoS service to
   determine appropriate settings for the radio parameters (e.g. can
   the application tolerate high bit error rates).

4.2   Controlled Load

   The Controlled Load (CL) Integrated Service is defined to provide a
   service approximating that of a lightly loaded network.  The service
   should provide that a very high percentage of transmitted packets
   will be successfully delivered by the network, and the transit delay
   of most packets will not greatly exceed the minimum transit delay of
   the routing vector.

   Applications with different service requirements must be provided
   bearers with suitable characteristics for that service.  With the
   wireless network admission controls, a radio bearer can receive
   characteristics similar to that of a lightly loaded wireless network
   for that type of radio bearer.



Fodor, Persson, Williams                                      [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT     Application of IntServ Services    Expires Jan 2002
                         on wireless accesses

   However, the CL service does not provide sufficient detail to
   identify the most suitable bearer, and thus the expected
   characteristics of _lightly loaded_ which are aimed for are not
   known.

4.3   Null Service

   The Null Service (NS) allows applications to identify themselves to
   network QoS policy agents rather than requiring them to specify
   resource requirements.  It is important to note that the policy must
   be identified per user for each application.

   Since the selection of radio bearers is performed from the UE, the
   policy agent could be provided there.  However, this places the
   burden for managing/configuring this agent on the end user.
   Furthermore, although many parameters for the radio bearer services
   could be identified based on the application, there are additional
   parameters that need more information about the actual specifics of
   the application session (for example, within one application, the
   choice of codec may determine the required bit error rate).

5   Conclusions

   In this report we considered the problem of allocating network
   resources in a scenario where IntServ enabled applications/hosts
   access an IP network through a wireless network.  This is a
   meaningful scenario that supports the separation of the applications
   from the specific interface technology, in this case, a wireless
   access.  In such a scenario the scarce wireless resources need to be
   allocated in the most effective manner to deliver service to the
   applications.

   While the specific radio related traffic descriptors and QoS
   parameters may vary between wireless technologies, we argue that
   additional information is necessary to achieve spectrum efficient
   service.

   The considerations in providing appropriate spectrum efficient radio
   bearers for the existing Integrated Services can be summarized as
   follows:

   Guaranteed Quality of Service

   o  It is difficult to meet the expectation of low delay and low loss
      in the wireless environment given the variation in radio channel
      performance.

   o  Increasing the bandwidth to reduce the queuing delay would be

   the required spectrum efficiency.  However, even for the CL service,

Appendix A   Transmission Model for Wireless Network
Appendix A.1   Overview

   When considering the effect of a wireless access network on an IP
   service, it is useful to have a model that describes the
   characteristics of the transmission over the wireless access
   network.  This model is described below.

   Following the development of the model, various parameters are
   identified that may be available in wireless networks to control the
   characteristics of individual radio bearer services that can be
   offered to the higher layer.  Conversely, this means that IP service
   requests need to be sufficiently granular to enable appropriate
   setting of these controls.

   From a modeling point of view, the WAN is an L2 network.  A queuing
   model for a WAN (L2) network (Figure 3) is somewhat different from

   the _traditional_ queuing models (e.g. as used to model an output
   port of a router).  The formulation of a queuing model for the L2 is
   important, because it serves as the basis for the discussion on the
   effects of different mechanisms in Section A.2.

   To develop the model, it is useful to follow the steps of
   transmitting an IP packet over a wireless access network.  We will
   use the uplink direction (i.e. from the TE to the CN and the
   server), but the major considerations are valid in the reverse
   direction as well.

   At the radio layer we use the term _radio service data unit (SDU)_
   to refer to the piece of data that is interchanged between the IP
   and radio layers.  That is, an IP packet that is handed over to the
   radio layer (L2) for transmission in the MT (in uplink) becomes a
   radio SDU.  The radio SDU is thereafter segmented into smaller radio
   packets.  The use of smaller radio packets helps to reduce the
   probability of bit errors in a single radio packet.  The optimum
   radio packet size is a trade-off between radio level overhead (radio
   packet header, CRC, number of retransmissions, etc.) and the packet
   error probability.

   The radio packets are transmitted over the air interface (AI) to the
   base stations (BS) and then through the radio network controller or
   base station controller (RNC/BSC) to the WAN GW.  We note that a UE
   may be in contact with one or more BS's at a time e.g. in CDMA
   networks.  The issues related to handover and soft hand-over can be
   found elsewhere (e.g. [SHO]) and are out of the scope of this
   draft].

          (eg interference,path loss, noise)

   Figure 3 Simplified model of the transmission of a radio packet


   The radio packets are queued for transmission over the air
   interface.  The L1 transmission over the air is modeled as a queue
   server of capacity R bit/s that corresponds to the actual physical
   bit rate of the radio channel.  The radio channel is lossy, meaning
   that radio packets may get lost (due to interference, path loss,
   etc), or be partially damaged by single or consecutive bit errors.
   Depending on the signal to noise ratio, the bit error ratio over the
   wireless link could be up to the order of 10E-02 or even higher.

   Additionally, radio packets face a significant transmission delay
   over the radio interface independent of the channel rate.  This is
   taken into account by introducing a fixed transmission delay in the
   model.  Radio packet retransmission (ARQ) is available which is
   indicated by the reinsertion of radio packets in the queue, but we
   note that for real time services this mechanism typically is not
   used.

   In Figure 3 it is assumed that all radio packets belonging to a
   single IP packet share the same queue (i.e. the same radio channel).
   Furthermore, the model also assumes that the radio channel capacity
   R is constant, which is not necessarily an accurate assumption,
   since the radio channel capacity (in terms of transmitted bits per
   second) may decrease/increase due to rate control mechanisms at the
   radio layer.  Rate control mechanisms play an important role in the
   WAN as they allow the WAN to adaptively increase/decrease the radio
   resources associated with a radio channel for a specific user.  Of
   course, from the IP layer perspective, the available rate varies due
   to rate changes at the radio packet level, as well as variation due
   to segmentation and retransmission.

   While this model is sufficient for examining the usability of the
   IntServ, it should be noted that in some cases it makes sense to
   assign different radio QoS classes for the different parts of an IP
   packet.  For instance, this is the case for the popular voice codec
   Adaptive Multi-rate (AMR) codec [AMR], where the different segments
   (bits) of the coded speech samples represent unequally important
   pieces of information for the human ear.  Therefore the different
   parts of a speech sample may be transported over different radio
   channels offering different error protection.  This mechanism is
   often referred to as unequal error protection (UEP) [UEP].

   In the WAN the radio layer is terminated.  Parameters may control
   whether lost/erroneous radio packets are retransmitted or not.  For
   real time traffic, retransmission may not be requested, and
   therefore the re-assembled IP packets may contain bit errors both in
   the payload and in the header.

Appendix A.2   Radio Channel Characteristics and Performance
              Optimization

   In a wireless communication system the signals are disturbed by
   several reasons while propagating from the sender to the receiver.
   The most common reasons include path loss, fading and interference.
   Path Loss refers to the loss in signal power due to distance and
   indirect propagation paths (environment dependent).  Fading is
   experienced when the signal propagates over multiple paths (fast
   fading) or is shadowed by e.g. hills and other obstacles.  Since the
   experienced path and environment are changing not only during the
   movement of a user, but also when the user is stationary, the
   experienced path loss and fading typically are changing both in time
   and space.  Interference results from noise and transmission signals
   of other users.

   There is a range of radio transmission mechanisms to combat these
   problems.  The desired performance (delay, bit rate etc.) and cost
   in resources and complexity will decide which ones to use.
   Different applications and services have different requirements, and
   will require different mechanisms.  While the environment cannot be
   controlled, the required signal-to-interference ratio, SIR, normally
   can be achieved _ either directly by increasing the signal power or
   indirectly by lowering the SIR requirement.

   The direct method of increasing the signal power is quite
   straightforward.  When the SIR is increased the receiver becomes
   less sensitive to path loss, fading and interference.  The drawback
   is that increased signal power for one user is experienced as
   increased interference to the other users nearby.  An increased
   interference level leads to degraded quality (more bit errors) or,
   if the quality for each user should be maintained, lower system
   capacity (since the number of users then must be decreased).  A
   well-balanced SIR must therefore be combined with some other
   mechanisms ensuring the reliability (bit- and packet error ratios).
   By adding redundancy to the radio packets, the SIR requirements can
   be decreased.  One way of doing it is to retransmit erroneous
   packets until the required reliability is reached (ARQ _ Automatic
   repeat request), as shown in Figure 3.  Errors are detected by a CRC
   (Cyclic Redundancy Check) code.  Another way is to add redundancy in
   error correcting codes (FEC _ Forward Error Correction).  ARQ is
   often used in combination with FEC.

   The advantage of ARQ is the low average signal power that is needed.
   The drawback is that the contribution from the fixed transmission
   delay (and partly also the queuing delay) will increase
   proportionally with the number of retransmissions.  The advantage

Fodor, Persson, Williams                                     [Page 12]

INTERNET DRAFT     Application of IntServ Services    Expires Jan 2002
                         on wireless accesses

   with FEC is the low transmission delay (a packet is transmitted only
   once).  However, higher signal power is required (since fewer errors
   will be accepted over the channel), which leads to increased
   interference in the system.  Further, the same high reliability as
   obtained by ARQ is not possible by only using FEC.  The way the
   reliability is implemented (ARQ and/or FEC) affects both the
   performance (in reliability and delay) and number of served users.

   The correction capability of the error correcting codes can be
   improved by adding interleaving to the bit stream.  Consecutive bits
   are then sent in a non-consecutive way, so that error bursts
   residing from fading on the channel are spread over the message.
   Isolated errors are easier to recover than errors residing in
   bursts.  It will therefore be possible to better recover the radio
   packets with the unaffected bits.  The degree to which the stream is
   interleaved is defined by the interleaving depth (i.e. the time
   interval over which the errors are spread).  Larger interleaving
   depth will strengthen the effect, but leads also to longer
   transmission delay over the radio (a big part of the fixed
   transmission delay in Figure 3 can be derived from interleaving).

Appendix A.3   Radio Channel Parameters

   Resource allocation for and QoS handling of the radio SDUs are
   typically done on a per-radio channel basis.  The specific radio
   technology may support various QoS classes and QoS parameters to
   support QoS provisioning and efficient radio resource utilization.
   Typical radio admission control algorithms base the admission
   decision on the description of the traffic and the desired QoS
   (Figure 4).

   Figure 4 The scope of the radio network traffic and QoS parameters


   In the following we discuss some of the most common traffic and QoS
   parameters that are used at the radio layer for managing resources,
   exercise admission control, etc.

Appendix A.3.1   Traffic Descriptors

   For real time traffic, the radio channel is typically characterized
   by a peak bit rate,  a long-term average bit rate, and a maximum
   packet size.  The traffic offered to the radio network needs to be
   conformant to all of these characteristics in order for it to
   receive the negotiated radio level QoS.  If the packet sizes are
   fixed or within a strictly limited set of sizes, the radio network
   can be further optimized if the exact sizes and internal payload
   format are given.

Appendix A.3.2   QoS Parameters

   The QoS parameters describe the expected performance of the network
   as measured at the egress point (Figure 4).  Since packets can be
   lost, delivered out of order or with bit errors, it is reasonable to
   consider the following QoS parameters:

   o  Radio SDU transfer delay [ms]
      Since the radio SDU delay in general is a random variable, the
      delay is usually characterized as the maximum delay for a high
      value (e.g. 95%) percentile of the distribution of delay for all
      delivered SDUs during the lifetime of a radio channel.  The
      purpose of specifying this parameter is to quantify the delay
      that is tolerated by the application using the radio channel.
      This parameter may be used by the WAN e.g. to set the maximum
      number of allowed retransmissions (if any) and the interleaving
      depth.

   o  Radio SDU error ratio
      This parameter indicates the maximum fraction of radio SDUs that
      can be lost or detected as erroneous.  The SDU error ratio is
      usually defined only for conformant traffic, and is in radio
      networks an important quality measure (especially for services
      like speech).

   o  Bit error ratio (BER)
      The bit error ratio (BER) indicates the fraction of the total
      number of delivered erroneous bits.  It cannot be measured
      explicitly in the network, but is instead used as an implicit
      requirement, given that the requirement on Radio SDU error ratio

Fodor, Persson, Williams                                     [Page 14]

INTERNET DRAFT     Application of IntServ Services    Expires Jan 2002
                         on wireless accesses

      is fulfilled.  The BER requirement is used when deciding the CRC
      length (variable in radio networks).  It can also be used for
      weighting of the coding rates between different radio bearers.
      This weighting cannot be derived from the Radio SDU error ratio
      if the radio packet sizes are not known beforehand, which is a
      common case.

   o  Delivery of erroneous radio packets required [y/n]
      This parameter indicates whether radio packets with detected bit
      errors should be delivered or not.  In the case of unequal error
      protection, this attribute should be set for each sub-flow.  This
      parameter is needed for applications that can handle bit errors
      in the payload (e.g. voice codecs as AMR) in order to
      appropriately control the behavior of the WAN.

   o  Sequence integrity (delivery order) required [y/n]
      This parameter indicates whether the radio channel must provide
      in-sequence delivery of the radio SDUs or not.

   o  Traffic handling (packet scheduling) priority
      For some types of radio channels it can be advantageous to
      specify relative, rather than absolute, QoS guarantees for a
      radio channel.  For instance, a _better than best effort_ type of
      radio channel may require a higher priority than a _best effort_
      radio channel without specifying an absolute delay bound.  In
      such cases the notion of the packet handling priority may be
      useful.  When specified, the WAN uses this parameter for radio
      packet scheduling.
