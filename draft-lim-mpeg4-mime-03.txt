                   MIME Type Registration for MPEG-4       March 2005 
    
1. Introduction 
    
   This document describes standard definition of MIME types associated 
   with MP4 files and the guidelines for using them. 

   MPEG-4, ISO/IEC 14496, is a standard designed for the representation 
   and delivery of multimedia information over a variety of transport 
   protocols[3].  It includes interactive scene management, visual and 
   audio representations as well as systems functionality like 
   multiplexing, synchronization, and an object descriptor framework.  
    
   The historical approach for MPEG data is to declare it under "video", 
   and this approach is followed for ISO/IEC 14496.  In addition some 
   MIME types are defined under "audio" and "application" for the 
   streams not containing visual presentation. 
    
   Amendment 1 of the ISO/IEC 14496 standard (also known as version 2) 
   includes a standard file type for encapsulating ISO/IEC 14496 data.  
   This file type can be used in a number of ways: perhaps the most 
   important are its use as an interchange format for ISO/IEC 14496 
   data, its use as a content-download format, and as the format read by 
   streaming media servers. 
    
   These first two uses will be greatly facilitated if there is a 
   standard MIME type for serving these files (e.g. over HTTP). 
    
   The ISO/IEC 14496 standard is broad, and therefore the type of data 
   that may be in such a file can vary. In brief, simple compressed 
   video and audio (using a number of different compression algorithms) 
   can be included; interactive scene information; meta-data about the 
   presentation; references to ISO/IEC 14496 media streams outside the 
   file and so on. Different top-level MIME types are used to identify 
   the type of the contents in the file. 
   
2. Selection of MIME types for MP4 file 
   
   The MIME types to be assigned to MP4 files are selected based on the 
   contents. Basic guidelines of selecting MIME types are as follows: 
    
   a) if the file contains neither visual nor audio presentations, but  
   only for example MPEG-J or MPEG-7, use application/mp4 
    
   b) for all other files, including those which have MPEG-J etc. in  
   addition to video or audio streams, video/mp4 should be used,  
   although: 
    
   c) for files with audio but no visual aspect, including those which  
   have MPEG-J etc. in addition to audio streams, audio/mp4 may be used. 
    
   In either case, these indicate files conforming to the "MP4" 
   specification (ISO/IEC 14496-1:2000, systems file format).

3. IANA Considerations 
 
   This section describes the MIME types and names to be used with 
   various MPEG-4 contents. Sections from 4.1 to 4.5 register five new 
   MIME types. 
    
3.1  MP4 file
    
   MIME media type name:        video 
    
   MIME subtype name:   mp4 
 
   Required parameters: none 
    
   Optional parameters: none 
    
   Encoding considerations:     base64 generally preferred; files are 
   binary and should be transmitted without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit 
   stripping etc. 
    
   Security considerations:     See section 5 of RFC XXXX 
    
   Interoperability considerations:     A number of interoperating 
   implementations exist within the ISO/IEC 14496 community;  and that 
   community has reference software for reading and writing the file 
   format. 
    
   Published specification: ISO/IEC 14496-1:2001. 
    
   Applications:        Multimedia 
    
   Additional information: 
    
   Magic number(s):     none 
   File extension(s):   mp4 and mpg4 are both declared at 
   <http://pitch.nist.gov/nics/>

4. Security Considerations 
    
   It is possible to inject non-compliant MPEG streams (Audio, Video, 
   and Systems) in the MP4 file to overload the receiver/decoder's 
   buffers which might compromise the functionality of the receiver 
   or even crash it. This is especially true for end-to-end systems 
   like MPEG where the buffer models are precisely defined. 
    
   MP4 file supports storage of stream types including commands that 
   are executed on the terminal like OD commands, BIFS commands, etc. 
   and programmatic content like MPEG-J (Java(TM) Byte Code) and 
   ECMASCRIPT. It is possible to use one or more of the above in a 
   manner non-compliant to MPEG to crash or temporarily make the 
   receiver unavailable.  
    
   Authentication mechanisms can be used to validate of the sender and 
   the data to prevent security problems due to non-compliant malignant 
   MP4 file.
    
   A security model is defined in ISO/IEC 14496 Systems MP4 files 
   containing MPEG-J contents which comprises Java(TM) classes and 
   objects. MPEG-J defines a set of Java APIs and a secure execution 
   model. MPEG-J content can call this set of APIs and Java(TM) methods 
   from a set of Java packages supported in the receiver within the 
   defined security model. According to this security model, downloaded 
   byte code is forbidden to load libraries, define native methods, 
   start programs, read or write files, or read system properties.
