Internet-Draft        X.509 authentication in SSH2             July 2005


1.  Introduction

   The SSH protocol can use public keys for both host and user
   authentication.  However, particularly for host authentication, plain
   public keys lack a good method of verifying that the the key provided
   really does belong to the host asserting ownership.  X.509v3
   certificates can address this problem in environments where a PKI
   infrastructure is available.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Certificate validation

   Implementations are expected to follow the basic certificate and
   certificate path validation guidelines described in [RFC3280].  No
   SSH specific X.509 certificate extensions are defined in this
   document.

3.1  Host Authentication

   The client MAY verify that the serverAuth option, as specified in
   [RFC3280], is present in the host certificate's extendedKeyUsage
   field.

   Implementations SHOULD validate the host certificates by matching the
   host's fully qualified domain name [RFC1034] against the host
   certificate's subjectAltName extension's dNSName entries.  If the
   certificate does not contain dNSName subjectAltName extensions, the
   (most specific) Common Name field in the certificate Subject is to be
   used.  This is similar to host validation in [RFC2818].

3.2  User Authentication

   The server MAY verify that the clientAuth option, as specified in
   [RFC3280], is present in the user certificate's extendedKeyUsage
   field.

   No constraints are placed on the presence of user account information
   in the certificates used for user authentication.  Their validation
   and mapping is left as an implementation and configuration detail for
   the implementors and deployers.

4.  Use in SSH2 Protocol

   Key type names are of the form "x509v3-sign*".  Keys are encoded as
   follows:

       string    key-type-name
       string    DER encoded x.509v3 certificate data


4.1  x509v3-sign-rsa-sha1

   Certificates that use the RSA public key algorithm SHOULD use the
   "x509v3-sign-rsa-sha1" key-type-name.

   Signing and verifying using this key format, uses the certificate's
   private key, in exactly the same manner specified for "ssh-rsa"
   public keys in [I-D.ietf-secsh-transport].  That is to say, signing
   and verifying using this key format is performed according to the
   RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 scheme in [RFC3447] using the SHA-1 hash.

   The signature format for x509v3-sign-rsa-sha1 certificates is the
   "ssh-rsa" signing format specified in [I-D.ietf-secsh-transport].
   This format is as follows:

       string    "ssh-rsa"
       string    rsa_signature_blob

   The value for 'rsa_signature_blob' is encoded as a string containing
   s (which is an integer, without lengths or padding, unsigned and in
   network byte order).

4.2  x509v3-sign-dss-sha1

   Certificates that use the DSA public key algorithm SHOULD use the
   "x509v3-sign-dss-sha1" key-type-name.

   Signing and verifying using this key format, uses the certificate's
   private key, in exactly the same manner specified for "ssh-dss"
   public keys in [I-D.ietf-secsh-transport].  That is to say, signing
   and verifying using this key format is done according to the Digital
   Signature Standard [FIPS-186-2] using the SHA-1 hash [FIPS-180-2].

   The signature format for x509v3-sign-dss-sha1 certificates is the
   "ssh-dss" signing format specified in [I-D.ietf-secsh-transport].
   This format is as follows:

       string    "ssh-dss"
       string    dss_signature_blob

Internet-Draft        X.509 authentication in SSH2             July 2005


   The value for 'dss_signature_blob' is encoded as a string containing
   r followed by s (which are 160-bit integers, without lengths or
   padding, unsigned and in network byte order).

4.3  x509v3-sign

   Certificates that use another algorithm other than the two specified
   above, MUST use the "x509v3-sign" key-type-name.

   Signing and verifying is done according to the specification
   associated with the public-key algorithm oid encoded in the
   certificate.

   The signature, and description of the signature algorithms is encoded
   as specified in [PKCS.7.1993].  The signature MUST be detached (the
   signed data MUST NOT be included in the pkcs7 data).

   The pkcs7 data is encoded in the SSH protocol as follows:

       string    "pkcs7"
       string    DER encoded PKCS7 data


5.  Implementation Considerations

   Implementations should be careful when using x.509v3 certificates as
   hostkeys.  If the peer does not implement the required algorithms to
   validate both the x.509v3 certificate and all certificates in the
   chain, it MUST disconnect.  There is no way to renegotiate the key
   during key exchange.

   This is especially true when using the "x509v3-sign" key type, since
   in this case the peer has no knowledge whatsoever of required
   algorithms.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document reserves all key types beginning with "x509v3-sign" in
   the SSH publickey type registry.

   This document specifically adds "x509v3-sign-rsa-sha1", "x509v3-sign-
   dss-sha1", and "x509v3-sign" to the SSH publickey type registry.

   This document adds "x509v3-sign-rsa" and "x509v3-sign-dss" to the SSH
   publickey type registry as "poisoned" by historical use.

7.  Security Considerations

   PKI is an extremely complex topic, and care must be taken by both
   implementors and deployers to understand the complex interactions
   involved.

   Implementations should carefully validate the certificate, including,
   but not limited to, certificate expiration, certificate signature,
   certificate revocation lists, etc.

   For more information, implementors should refer to [ITU.X509.2000]
   and [RFC3280].
