1.  Introduction

   The Internet community has been mobilized in the past to agree on a
   strategy for the evolution of the Internet and its associated IP
   model (e.g., [RFC6250]).  An effort, called Internet "Architecture
   Retreat", has been initiated in the early 90's by the IAB (Internet
   Architecture Board) and IESG (Internet Engineering Steering Group) to
   investigate issues met by the Internet.  A set of recommendations
   "towards the future Internet architecture" have been drawn [RFC1287].

   At that time (although it may be seen as nonsense in 2016), the
   Internet community faced a dilemma: either choose to deliberately
   limit the growth of the Internet or take the risk of disrupting the
   network and introduce new techniques for the sake of Internet growth.
   In addition to the need to support real-time services, [RFC1287]
   acknowledged that routing information explosion and address space
   consumption were the most urgent problems to solve.  Given small
   changes may require a long time to be effective, [RFC1287] advocated
   for a long term action plan to preserve the architectural principles
   of the Internet instead of implementing small changes.

   Then, a group called ROAD [RFC1380] has been formed to structure the
   problem space and to propose some directions for future Internet.
   ROAD and [RFC1287] have inspired IAB to propose an action plan to
   overcome the alarming decrease of IP address pools and the growth of
   routing tables [I-D.iab-ipversion7].  Concretely, IAB recommended to
   deprecate the Class "A"/"B"/"C" address taxonomy, to enforce CIDR
   (Classless Inter-domain Routing, [RFC4632]) as a short term solution,
   and to get ready for the introduction of "IP version 7" (not to
   confuse with [RFC1475]) in a mid and long term.  Once the address
   shortage is solved, design a routing architecture which does not
   assume any dependency between addresses and the underlying routing
   topology.

   Later, the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) has adopted the
   strategy proposed by the IAB but objected to some technical choices.
   Particularly, the IETF rejected the recommendation on IPv7 in favour

   of IPv6 [RFC2460]; the reader may refer to [RFC1752] for more
   details.  As an input to its decision-making process, the IETF formed
   a working group called Address Lifetime Estimation (ALE) to estimate
   the IPv4 address depletion date and to implicitly qualify the level
   of urgency to specify an alternative scheme to IPv4 addressing.  For
   the record, ALE estimated the IPv4 address depletion date between
   2005 and 2011 [RFC1752]; this projection has been confirmed by recent
   announcements of IANA about the depletion of global IPv4 addresses.

   Various proposals have been RFCed to solve some of the problems
   encountered by the Internet architecture.  IP version numbers have
   been assigned to some of them:

   Decimal Keyword Version
   ======= ======= ========================
   5       ST      ST Datagram Mode
   7       TP/IX   TP/IX: The Next Internet
   8       PIP     The P Internet Protocol
   9       TUBA    TUBA

   Given that IPv6 is a deployment reality and there are no proven
   deployments of the aforementioned IP versions, this document
   reclassifies ST ([RFC1347]), PIP ([RFC1819]) and TUBA ([RFC1621]) to
   Historic status.

   Note that [RFC1475] is already obsoleted.

2.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security issues.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to deallocate the version numbers
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/version-numbers/version-
   numbers.xhtml): 5, 7, 8, and 9.
