              SIP Call-Info Parameters for Rich Call Data
                  draft-wendt-sipcore-callinfo-rcd-00

Abstract

   This document describes a SIP Call-Info parameter defined to include
   rich data associated with the identity of the calling party that can
   be rendered to called party for providing more useful information
   about the caller or the specific reason for the call.  This includes
   extended comprehensive information about the caller such as what a
   jCard object can represent for describing the calling party.  The
   element defined for this purpose is intended to be extensible to
   accommodate related information about calls that helps people decide
   whether to pick up the phone and additionally with the use of jCard
   be compatible with the STIR/PASSporT Rich Call Data framework.

1.  Introduction

   Traditional telephone network signaling protocols have long supported
   delivering a 'calling name' from the originating side, though in
   practice, the terminating side is often left to derive a name from
   the calling party number by consulting a local address book or an
   external database.  SIP similarly can carry a 'display-name' in the
   From header field value from the originating to terminating side,
   though it is an unsecured field that is not commonly trusted.  The
   same is true of information in the Call-Info header field.

   To allow calling parties to initiate and called parties to receive a
   more comprehensive deterministic and extensible rich call data for
   incoming calls, we describe a new token for the SIP [RFC3261] Call-
   Info header field and purpose parameter.  For this document and
   depending on the policies of the communications system, calling
   parties could either be the end user device or an originating service
   provider and called parties could also similarly be an end user
   device or the terminating service provider acting on behalf of the
   recipient of the call.

   This specification, on it's own, inherently assumes that called party
   user agent can trust the SIP network or the SIP provider to deliver
   the correct rich call data (RCD) information.  This may not always be
   the case and thus, the entity inserting the Call-Info header field
   and the UAS relying on it SHOULD be part of the same trust domain
   [RFC3324].  Alternatively, and likely the recommended approach is the
   entity inserting the call-info header should also sign the caller
   information via STIR mechanisms [RFC8224] and specifically through
   the [I-D.ietf-stir-passport-rcd] is likely either to be the caller
   itself or the originating service provider using an authoritative
   signature to authenticate the information is from the originator and
   hasn't been tampered with in transmission.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

Internet-Draft          Call-Info Rich Call Data           November 2019


3.  Overview

   The Call-Info header field, defined in [RFC3261] Section 20.9,
   defines a purpose parameter currently with "info", "icon", and "card"
   tokens.  This document defines the purpose value of "jcard" which is
   used to associate rich call data related to the identity of the
   calling party in the form of a jCard [RFC7095].  While there is a
   "card" token that is already defined with similar purpose, there are
   two primary reasons for the definition and usage of jCard and the use
   of JSON over the XML based vCard [RFC2426].  JSON has become the
   default and optimally supported for transmission, parsing, and
   manipulation of data on IP networks.  jCard has also been defined in
   [I-D.ietf-stir-passport-rcd] and has been adopted by PASSporT
   [RFC8225] because of the usage of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) [RFC7519].

4.  "jcard" Call-Info Token

   The use of the new Call-Info Token "jcard" is for the purpose of
   supporting RCD associated with the identity of a calling party in a
   SIP call [RFC3261] Section 20.9.  The format of a Call-Info header
   field when using the "jcard" is as follows.

   The Call-Info header should include a URI where the resource pointed
   to by the URI is a jCard JSON object defined in [RFC7095].  The URI
   MUST define the use HTTPS or a transport that can validate the
   integrity of the source of the resource as well as the transport
   channel the resource is retrieved.

   An example of a Call-Info header field is:

     Call-Info: <https://example.com/jbond.json>

   An example jCard JSON file is shown as follows:

5.  Usage of jCard and property specific usage

   Beyond the definition of the specific properties or JSON arrays
   associated with each property.  This specification defines a few
   rules above and beyond [RFC7095] specific to making sure there is a
   mimimum level of supported properties that every implementation of
   this specification should adhere to.  This includes the support of
   intepreting the value of this property and the ability to render in
   some form appropriate to the display capabilities of the device.
   This includes requirements specific to either textual displays and
   graphics capable displays.

5.1.  Identification properties

   These types are used to capture information associated with the
   identification and naming of the entity associated with the jCard.

5.1.1.  "fn" property

   The "fn" property MUST be supported with the intent of providing a
   formatted text corresponding to the name of the object the jCard
   represents.  Reference [RFC6350] Section 6.2.1.

   Example:
   ["fn", {}, "text", "Mr. John Q. Public\, Esq."]

Internet-Draft          Call-Info Rich Call Data           November 2019


5.1.2.  "n" property

   The "n" property SHOULD be supported with the intent of providing the
   components of the name of the object the jCard represents.  Reference
   [RFC6350] Section 6.2.2.

   Example:
   ["n", {}, "text", "Public;John;Quinlan;Mr.;Esq."]
   ["n", {}, "text", "Stevenson;John;Philip,Paul;Dr.;Jr.,M.D.,A.C.P."]

5.1.3.  "nickname" property

   The "nickname" property SHOULD be supported with the intent of
   providing the text corresponding to the nickname of the object the
   jCard represents.  Reference [RFC6350] Section 6.2.3.

   Example:
   ["nickname", {}, "text", "Robbie"]
   ["nickname", {}, "text", "Jim,Jimmie"]
   ["nickname", {}, "text", "TYPE=work:Boss"]

5.1.4.  "photo" property

   The "photo" property MUST be supported with the intent of an image or
   photograph information that annotates some aspect of the object the
   jCard represents.  Reference [RFC6350] Section 6.2.4.

   In addition to the definition of jCard, and to promote
   interoperability and proper formating and rendering of images, the
   photo SHOULD correspond to a square image size of the sizes 128x128,
   256x256, 512x512, or 1024x1024 pixels.

  Example:
  ["photo", {}, "uri", "http://www.example.com/pub/photos/jqpublic.gif"]

5.2.  Delivery Addressing Properties

   These properties are concerned with information related to the
   delivery addressing or label for the jCard object.

5.2.1.  "adr" property

   The "adr" property MUST be supported with the intent of providing the
   delivery address of the object the jCard represents.  Reference
   [RFC6350] Section 6.3.1.

 Example:
 ["adr", {"type":"work"}, "text",
   ["", "", "3100 Massachusetts Avenue NW", "Washington", "DC", "20008",
   "USA"]

5.3.  Communications Properties

   These properties describe information about how to communicate with
   the object the jCard represents.

5.3.1.  "tel" property

   The "tel" property MUST be supported with the intent of providing the
   telephone number for telephony communication of the object the jCard
   represents.  Reference [RFC6350] Section 6.4.1.

   Relative to the SIP From header field this information may provide
   alternate telephone number or other related telephone numbers for
   other uses.

   Example:
   ["tel", { "type": ["voice", "text", "cell"], "pref": "1" }, "uri",
     "tel:+1-202-555-1000"]
   ["tel", { "type": ["fax"] }, "uri", "tel:+1-202-555-1001"]

5.3.2.  "email" property

   The "email" property MUST be supported with the intent of providing
   the electronic mail address for communication of the object the jCard
   represents.  Reference [RFC6350] Section 6.4.2.

   Example:
   ["email", {"type":"work"}, "text", "jqpublic@xyz.example.com"]
   ["email", {"pref":"1"}, "text", "jane_doe@example.com"]

5.3.3.  "lang" property

   The "lang" property MUST be supported with the intent of providing
   the language(s) that may be used for contacting of the object the
   jCard represents.  Reference [RFC6350] Section 6.4.4.

   Example:
   ["lang", {"type":"work", "pref":"1"}, "language-tag", "en"]
   ["lang", {"type":"work", "pref":"2"}, "language-tag", "fr"]
   ["lang", {"type":"home"}, "language-tag", "fr"]

5.4.  Geographical Properties

   These properties are concerned with information associated with
   geographical positions or regions associated with the object the
   jCard represents.

5.4.1.  "tz" property

   The "tz" property MUST be supported with the intent of providing the
   time zone of the object the jCard represents.  Reference [RFC6350]
   Section 6.5.1.

   Editor Note: recommendations of representing Time Zone don't seem to
   be clear.  TBD.

   Example:
   ["tz", {}, "text", "Raleigh/North America"]

5.4.2.  "geo" property

   The "geo" property MUST be supported with the intent of providing the
   global positioning of the object the jCard represents.  Reference
   [RFC6350] Section 6.5.2.

   Example:
   ["geo", {}, "uri", "geo:37.386013,-122.082932"]

5.5.  Organizational Properties

   These properties are concerned with information associated with
   characteristics of the organization or organizational units of the
   object that the jCard represents.

5.5.1.  "title" property

   text

5.5.2.  "role" property

   text

5.5.3.  "logo" property

5.6.  Explanatory Properties

   These properties are concerned with additional explanations, such as
   that related to informational notes or revisions specific to the
   jCard.

   ref 6.7.1

5.6.2.  "note" property

   ref 6.7.2

5.6.3.  "sound" property

5.6.4.  "uid" property

   ref 6.7.6 (origID like value?)

5.6.5.  "url" property

   ref 6.7.8

6.  Extension of jCard

   Part of the intent of the usage of jCard is that it has it's own
   extensibility properties where new properties can be defined to relay
   newly defined information related to a caller.  This capability is
   inherently supported as part of standard extensibility.  However,
   usage of those new properties should be published and registered
   following [RFC7095] Section 3.6 or new specifications.

   We would like to thank members of the STIR working group for helpful
   suggestions and comments for the creation of this draft.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  SIP Call-Info Header Field Purpose Token Request

   [this RFC] defines the "jcard" token for use as a new token in the
   Call-Info header in the "Header Field Parameters and Parameter
   Values" registry defined by [RFC3968].

      +--------------+----------------+-------------------+------------+
      | Header Field | Parameter Name | Predefined Values | Reference  |
      +--------------+----------------+-------------------+------------+
      | Call-Info    | jcard          | No                | [this RFC] |
      +--------------+----------------+-------------------+------------+

9.  Security Considerations

   Revealing information such as the name, location, and affiliation of
   a person necessarily entails certain privacy risks.  SIP and Call-
   Info has no particular confidentiality requirement, as the
   information sent in SIP is in the clear anyway.  Transport-level
   security can be used to hide information from eavesdroppers, and the
   same confidentiality mechanisms would protect any Call-Info or jCard
   information carried or referred to in SIP.
