Abstract

   Identifier-Locator Addressing [I-D.herbert-nvo3-ila] relies on
   splitting the 128-bit IPv6 address into identifier and locator parts
   to implement identifier mobility, and network virtualization.  This
   document proposes a method for distributing the identifier to locator
   mapping information using Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4
   [RFC4760].

1.  Introduction

   Under the ILA proposal, the IPv6 address is split in 64-bit
   identifier (lower address bits) and locator (higher address bits)
   portions.  The locator part is determined from a mapping table that
   maintains associations between the location-independent identifiers
   and topologically significant locators.  The hosts that collectively
   implement and maintain such mappings are referred to as "ILA domain"
   in this document.  This document proposes a new address family
   identifier (AFI) for the purpose of disseminating the locator-
   identifier mappings among the nodes participating in the ILA domain.

2.  BGP ILA AFI

   This document introduces a new AFI known as a "Identifier-Locator
   AFI" with the actual value to be assigned by IANA.  The purpose of
   this AFI is disseminating the mapping information between identifiers
   and locators in ILA domain.  This document defines the use of SAFI
   values of "1" (unicast) and "2" (multicast) only.

3.  Capability Advertisement

   A BGP speaker that wishes to exchange ILA mapping information MUST
   use the Multiprotocol Extensions Capability Code, as defined in
   [RFC4760], to advertise the corresponding AFI/SAFI pair.

4.  Disseminating Identifier-Locator mapping information

4.1.  Advertising ILA mapping information

   For the purpose of ILA mapping encoding, the 8-octet locator field
   SHALL be encoded in the "next-hop address" field.  The "length of the
   next-hop address" MUST be set to "8" (64-bit).  The identifiers bound
   to the locator SHALL be encoded within the NLRI portion of
   MP_REACH_NLRI attribute.  The NLRI portion of MP_REACH_NLRI starts
   with the two-octet "Length of identifiers" field.  The rest of the
   NLRI is a collection of 8-octet (64-bit) identifiers that are bound
   to the locator specified in the "next-hop address" field.

              +---------------------------------------------------------+
              | Address Family Identifier (2 octets)                    |
              +---------------------------------------------------------+
              | Subsequent Address Family Identifier (1 octet)          |
              +---------------------------------------------------------+
              | Length of Next Hop Address (1 octet, set to "8")        |
              +---------------------------------------------------------+
              | Locator value (8 octets)                                |
              +---------------------------------------------------------+
              | Reserved (1 octet), must be zero                        |
              +---------------------------------------------------------+
              | Length of identifiers field (2 octets, multiple of 8)   |
              +---------------------------------------------------------+
              | Identifiers (variable, 8 octets each)                   |
              +---------------------------------------------------------+

4.2.  Withdrawing ILA mapping information

   Withdrawal of ILA mapping information is performed via an
   MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute advertisement organized as following:

5.  Interpreting the mapping information

5.1.  Unicast SAFI

   Only the locator part of ILA address is used for packet routing, and
   every node that hosts an identifier MUST have a unique routable /64
   prefix within the scope of the ILA domain.  The identifiers
   advertised under the ILA AFI are expected to be used by the data-
   plane implementation to perform match on a full IPv6 address and
   decide whether the locator portion of the address needs a re-write.
   It is up to the implementation to decide which full 128-bit IPv6
   addresses need a rewrite, e.g. by matching on a Standard Identifier
   Representation (SIR) prefix as defined in [I-D.herbert-nvo3-ila].

   The locator rewrite information comes from the next-hop "address"
   associated with the identifier.  The next-hop field of MP_REACH_NLRI
   attribute MUST NOT be used for any routing resolutions/lookups by the
   BGP process itself.  It should be used purely to create a rewrite
   rule in the data-plane forwarding table.  The actual forwarding
   decision is then based on subsequent lookup in the forwarding table
   to find the next hop to send the packet to.

5.2.  Multicast SAFI

   For multicast packets, the RPF check process SHALL be modified for
   use with ILA source addresses.  Specifically, source ILA IPv6
   addresses with the identifier portion matching the mapping table
   SHALL be mapped to proper locator, prior to performing the RPF check.
   The ILA source addresses need to be identified by some means specific
   to ILA implementation, e.g. by matching on configured SIR prefixes.
   The ILA addresses that do not match any mapping entry SHALL be
   considered as failing the RPF check.

6.  IANA Considerations

   For the purpose of this work, IANA would be asked to allocate values
   for the new AFI.

7.  Manageability Considerations

   TBD

8.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any changes in terms of BGP
   security.  Defining ILA security model is outside of scope of this
   document.

9.  Acknowledgements

   The author would like to thank Doug Porter for the initial idea
   suggestion and discussion of this proposal.
