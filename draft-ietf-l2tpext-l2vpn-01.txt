Abstract

   The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) provides a standard method for
   setting up and managing L2TP sessions to tunnel a variety of L2
   protocols.  One of the reference models supported by L2TP describes
   the use of an L2TP session to connect two Layer 2 circuits attached
   to a pair of peering LACs, which is a basic form of Layer 2 Virtual
   Private Network (L2VPN).  This document defines the protocol
   extensions for L2TP to set up different types of L2VPN in a unified
   fashion.

1. Introduction

   [L2TPv3] defines a dynamic tunneling mechanism to carry multiple L2
   protocols besides PPP (as originally defined in [RFC 2661]) over a
   packet-based network.  The baseline protocol supports various types
   of applications, which have been highlighted in the different L2TP
   reference models in [L2TPv3].  L2VPN applications are typically in
   the scope of the LAC-LAC reference model.

   This document discusses the commonalities as well as differences
   among L2VPN applications with respect to utilizing L2TPv3 as the
   signaling protocol.

   The acronym "L2TP" refers to L2TPv3 or L2TP in general in this
   document.

2. Network Reference Model

   In the LAC-LAC reference model, a LAC serves as a cross-connect
   between attachment circuits and L2TP sessions.  Each L2TP session
   acts as an emulated circuit, also known as pseudowire.  A pseudowire
   is used to bind two "forwarders" together.  For different L2VPN
   applications, different types of forwarders are defined.

   In the L2VPN framework [L2VPN FW], a LAC is a Provider Edge (PE)
   device.  LAC and PE are interchangable terms in the context of this
   document.  Remote systems in the LAC-LAC reference model are Customer
   Edge (CE) devices.

   +----+  L2  +----+                      +----+  L2  +----+
   | CE |------| PE |....[core network]....| PE |------| CE |
   +----+      +----+                      +----+      +----+

                    |<- emulated service ->|
         |<----------------- L2 service -------------->|

                  L2VPN Network Reference Model

   In a simple cross-connect application, an attachment circuit is a
   forwarder directly bound to a pseudowire.  It is a one-to-one
   mapping.  Traffic received from the attachment circuit on a local PE
   is forwarded to the remote PE through the pseudowire.  When the
   remote PE receives traffic from the pseudowire, it forwards the
   traffic to the corresponding attachment circuit on its end.  The
   forwarding decision is based on the attachment circuit or pseudowire
   demultiplexing identifier.

   With Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), a Virtual Switching Instance
   (VSI) is a forwarder connected to one or more attachment circuits and
   pseudowires.  A single pseudowire is used to connect a pair of VSIs
   on two peering PEs.  Traffic received from an attachment circuit or a
   pseudowire is first forwarded to the corresponding VSI based on the
   attachment circuit or pseudowire demutiplexing identifier.  The VSI
   performs additional lookup to determine where to further forward the
   traffic.

   With Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS), attachment circuits are
   grouped into "colored pools".  Each pool is a forwarder and connected
   through a network of point-to-point cross-connect.  The data
   forwarding perspective is identical to the cross-connect application.
   However, constructing colored pools involves more complicated
   signaling procedures.

3. Forwarder Identifier

   A forwarder identifier is assigned to each forwarder on a given PE
   and is unique in the context of the PE.  It is defined as the
   concatenation of an Attachment Group Identifier (AGI) and an
   Attachment Individual Identifier (AII), denoted as <AGI, AII>.  The
   AGI is used to group a set of forwarders together for signaling
   purpose.  An AII is used to distinguish forwarders within a group.
   AII can be unique at a per platform or per group basis.

   As far as the signaling procedures are concerned, a forwarder
   identifier is an arbitrary string of bytes.  It is up to
   implementations to decide the values for AGI and AII.

   When connecting two forwarders together, both MUST have the same AGI
   as part of  their forwarder identifiers.  The AII of the source
   forwarder is known as the Source AII (SAII), and the AII of the
   target forwarder is known as the Target AII (TAII).  Therefore,
   source forwarder and target forwarder can be denoted as <AGI, SAII>
   and <AGI, TAII> respectively.


4. Protocol Components

4.1 Control Messages

   L2TP defines two sets of session management procedures: incoming call
   and outgoing call.  Even though it is entirely possible to use the
   outgoing call procedures to signaling L2VPNs, the incoming call
   procedures has some advantages in terms of the relevance of the
   semantics.  [PWE3L2TP] gives more details on why the incoming call
   procedures are more appropriate for setting up pseudowires.

   The signaling procedures for L2VPNs described in the following
   sections are based on the Incoming Call procedures.

4.2 Existing AVPs for L2VPN

Router ID

   The Router ID sent in SCCRQ and SCCRP during control connection setup
   establishes the unique identity of each PE.

Pseudowire Capabilities List

   The Pseudowire Capabilities List sent in the SCCRQ and SCCRP
   indicates the pseudowire types supported by the sending PE.  It
   merely serves as an advertisement to the receiving PE.  Its content



Luo                                                    	[Page 4]

Internet Draft      draft-ietf-l2tpext-l2vpn-01.txt            July 2004


   should not affect the control connection setup.

   Before a local PE initiates a session of a particular pseudowire type
   to a remote PE, it MUST examine whether the remote PE has advertised
   this pseudowire type in this AVP, and SHOULD NOT attempt to initiate
   the session if the intended pseudowire type is not supported by the
   remote PE.

Pseudowire Type

   The Pseudowire Type sent in ICRQ signals the intended pseudowire type
   to the receiving PE.  The receiving PE checks it against its local
   pseudowire capabilities list.  If it finds a match, it responds with
   an ICRP without a Pseudowire Type AVP, which implicitly acknowledges
   its acceptance of the intended pseudowire.  If it does not find a
   match, it MUST respond with a CDN with an "unsupported pseudowire
   type" result code.

Pseudowire Control Encapsulation

   The Pseudowire Control Encapsulation can be sent in ICRQ, ICRP, and
   ICCN.  If the receiving PE supports the specified control
   encapsulation, it MUST include it in its data packets sent to the
   sending PE.  Otherwise, it MUST reject the connection by sending a
   CDN to the sending PE.

Circuit Status

   The Circuit Status is sent in both ICRQ and ICRP to inform the
   receiving PE about the circuit status on the sending PE.  It can also
   be sent in ICCN and SLI to update the status.

Remote End Identifier

   The TAII value is encoded in the Remote End ID AVP and sent in ICRQ
   along with the optional AGI to instruct the receiving PE to bind the
   proposed pseudowire to the forwarder that matches the specified
   forwarder identifier.

4.3 New AVPs for L2VPN

Attachment Group Identifier

   The AGI AVP, Attribute Type TBA, is an identifier used to associate a
   forwarder to a logical group.  The AGI AVP is used in conjunction
   with the Local End ID AVP and Remote End ID AVP, which encode the
   SAII and TAII respectively, to identify a specific forwarder.  When
   the AGI AVP is omitted in the control messages or contains a zero-



Luo                                                    	[Page 5]

   length value, the forwarders are considered using the default AGI.
   Note that there is only one designated default AGI value for all
   forwarders.

   The Attribute Value field for this AVP has the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              TBA              |      AGI (variable length)    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The AGI field is a variable-length field.  This AVP MAY be present in
   ICRQ.

   This AVP MAY be hidden (the H bit MAY be 0 or 1).  The M bit for this
   AVP SHOULD be set to 0.  The Length (before hiding) of this AVP is 6
   plus the length of the AGI field.

Local End ID

   The Local End ID AVP, Attribute Type TBA, encodes the SAII value.
   The SAII may also be used in conjunction with the TAII to detect
   pseudowire ties.  When it is omitted in the control messages, it is
   assumed that it has the same value as the TAII.

   The Attribute Value field for this AVP has the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              TBA              |       SAII (variable length)  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The SAII field is a variable-length field.  This AVP MAY be present
   in ICRQ.

   This AVP MAY be hidden (the H bit MAY be 0 or 1).  The M bit for this
   AVP SHOULD be set to 0.  The Length (before hiding) of this AVP is 6
   plus the length of the SAII field.

Interface Maximum Transmission Unit

   The Interface Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) AVP, Attribute Type

Internet Draft      draft-ietf-l2tpext-l2vpn-01.txt            July 2004


   TBA, indicates the MTU in octets of an L2 packet, excluding L2TP
   encapsulation, that can be sent out from the CE-facing interface.
   The MTU values of a given pseudowire, if advertised in both
   directions, MUST be identical.  If they do not match, the pseudowire
   SHOULD NOT be established.  When it is omitted in the control
   messages in either direction, it is assumed that the remote PE has
   the same interface MTU as the local PE for the pseudowire being
   signaled.

   The Attribute Value field for this AVP has the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Interface MTU is a 2-octet value.  This AVP MAY be present in
   ICRQ and ICRP.

   This AVP MAY be hidden (the H bit MAY be 0 or 1).  The M bit for this
   AVP SHOULD be set to 0.  The Length (before hiding) of this AVP is 8.


5. Signaling Procedures

5.1 Overview

   Assume a PE assigns a forwarder identifier to one of its local
   forwarders, and knows it needs to set up a pseudowire to a remote
   forwarder on a remote PE that has a certain Forwarder ID.  This
   knowledge can be obtained either through manual configuration or some
   auto-discovery procedure.

   Before establishing the intended pseudowire, each pair of peering PEs
   exchanges control connection messages to establish a control
   connection.  Each advertises its supported pseudowire types in the
   Pseudowire Capabilities List AVP.

   After the control connection is established, the local PE examines
   whether the remote PE supports the pseudowire type it intends to set
   up.  Only if the remote PE supports the intended pseudowire type, it
   should initiate a pseudowire connection request.

   When the local PE receives an ICRQ for a pseudowire connection, it
   examines the forwarder identifier encoded in the AGI, SAII, and TAII



Luo                                                    	[Page 7]

Internet Draft      draft-ietf-l2tpext-l2vpn-01.txt            July 2004


   in order to determine the following:

     - whether it has a local forwarder with the forwarder identifier
       value specified in the ICRQ,

     - whether the remote forwarder with the forwarder identifier
       specified in the ICRQ is allowed to connect with this local
       forwarder.

   If both conditions are met, it sends an ICRP to the remote PE to
   accept the connection request.  If either of the two conditions
   fails, it sends a CDN to the remote PE to reject the connection
   request.

5.2 Pseudowire Tie Detection

   Conceivably in the network reference models, as either PE may
   initiate a pseudowire to another PE at any time, the PEs could end up
   initiating a pseudowire to each other simultaneously.  In order to
   avoid setting up duplicated pseudowires between two forwarders, each
   PE must be able to independently detect such a pseudowire tie.  The
   following procedures need to be followed to detect a tie:

   If both TAII and SAII are present in the ICRQ, the receiving PE
   compares the TAII and SAII against the SAII and TAII itself
   previously sent to the sending PE.  If the received TAII matches the
   sent SAII and the received SAII matches the sent TAII, a tie is
   detected.

   If only the TAII is present in the ICRQ, the SAII is assumed to have
   the same value as the TAII.  The receiving PE compares the received
   TAII with the SAII that it previously sent to the sending PE.  If the
   SAII in that ICRQ is also omitted, then the value encoded in the sent
   TAII is used for comparison.  If they match, a tie is detected.

   Once a tie has been discovered, the standard L2TP tie breaking
   procedure is used to disconnect the duplicated pseudowire.

5.3 Generic Algorithm

   The following uses a generic algorithm to illustrate the protocol
   interactions when constructing an L2VPN using L2TP signaling.

   Each PE first forms a list, SOURCE_FORWARDERS, consisting of all
   local forwarders of a given VPN.  Then it puts all local forwarders
   that need to be interconnected and all remote forwarders of the same
   VPN into another list, TARGET_FORWARDERS.  The formation of the
   network topology depends on the content in the SOURCE_FORWARDERS and



Luo                                                    	[Page 8]

Internet Draft      draft-ietf-l2tpext-l2vpn-01.txt            July 2004


   TARGET_FORWARDERS list.  These two lists can be constructed by manual
   configuration and/or some auto-discovery procedure.

   The algorithm is used to set up pseudowires among all the forwarders
   that intend to be interconnected by iterating through each source and
   target forwarder.  An L2VPN is formed upon finishing the algorithm in
   every participating PE of this L2VPN.

     1.  Pick the next forwarder, from SOURCE_FORWARDERS.  If no
         forwarder is available for processing, the processing is
         complete.

     2.  Pick the next forwarder, from TARGET_FORWARDERS.  If no
         forwarder is available for processing, go back to step 1.

     3.  If the two forwarders are associated with different Router
         IDs, a pseudowire must be established between them.  Proceed
         to step 6.

     4.  Compare the <AGI, AII> values of the two forwarders.  If
         they match, the source and target forwarders are the same,
         so no more action is necessary.  Go back to step 2.

     5.  As the source and target forwarders both reside on the local
         PE, no pseudowire is needed.  The PE simply creates a local
         cross-connect between the two forwarders.  Go back to step 2.

     6.  As the source and target forwarders reside on different PEs,
         a pseudowire must be established between them.  The PE first
         examines if the source forwarder has already established a
         pseudowire to the target forwarder.  If so, go back to step 2.

     7.  If no pseudowire is already established between the source and
         target forwarders, the local PE obtains the address of the
         remote PE, and establishes a control connection to the remote
         PE if one does not already exist.

     8.  The local PE sends an ICRQ to the remote PE.  The AGI, TAII,
         and SAII values are encoded in the AGI AVP, the Remote End ID
         AVP, and the Local End ID AVP respectively.

     9.  If the local PE receives a response corresponding to the
         ICRQ it just sent, proceed to step 10.  Otherwise, if the
         local PE receives an ICRQ from the same remote PE, proceed
         to step 11.

     10. The local PE receives a response from the remote PE.  If
         it is a CDN, go back to step 2.  If it's an ICRP, the local



Luo                                                    	[Page 9]

Internet Draft      draft-ietf-l2tpext-l2vpn-01.txt            July 2004


         PE binds the source forwarder to the pseudowire and sends
         an ICCN to the remote PE.  Go back to step 2.

     11. If the local PE receives an ICRQ from the same remote PE,
         it needs to perform session tie detection, as described in
         Section 5.2.  If a session tie is detected, the PE performs
         tie breaking.

     12. If the local PE loses the tie breaker, it sends a CDN with
         the result code that indicates the disconnection is due to
         losing the tie breaker.  Proceed to step 14.

     13. If the local PE wins the tie breaker, it ignores the remote
         PE's ICRQ, but acknowledges receipt of the control message
         and continues waiting for the response from the remote PE.
         Go to step 10.

     14. The local PE determines whether it should accept the
         connection request, as described in the Section 5.1.
         If it accepts the ICRQ, it sends an ICRP to the remote PE.

     15. The local PE receives a response from the remote PE.  If
         it is a CDN, go back to step 2.  If it is an ICCN, the local
         PE binds the source forwarder to the pseudowire, go back
         to step 2.

   The following diagram illustrates the above procedure:
