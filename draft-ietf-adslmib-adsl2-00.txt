Abstract

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the
   Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects used for 
   managing parameters of "Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line" family 
   of interface types, especially including ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+.

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a
   MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD
   58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC
   2580 [RFC2580].

2.  Overview

   This document describes an SNMP MIB module for managing the 
   ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ Lines.  These definitions are based upon 
   the specifications for defined in T1E1, European Telecommunications
   Standards Institute(ETSI), and International Telecommunication Union 
   (ITU) documentation [to be added].
   
   Additionally the management framework for New Generation ADSL lines 
   specified by the Digital Subscriber Line Forum (DSLF) has been taken 
   into consideration [DSLFTR90].

   The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB-2 transmission.
 
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "RECOMMENDED", and "SHOULD" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1  Relationship of this MIB Module to other MIB Modules

   To be added

2.2  Conventions used in the MIB Module

2.2.1  Naming Conventions

   A.  Atuc -- (ATUC) transceiver at near (Central) end of line
   B.  Atur -- (ATUR) transceiver at Remote end of line
   C.  Atu  -- One of either Atuc or Atur
   D.  Curr -- Current
   F.  Atn  -- Attenuation
   G.  Max  -- Maximum
   H.  Mgn  -- Margin
   I.  PSD  -- Power Spectral Density
   J.  Rx   -- Receive
   K.  Snr  -- Signal to Noise Ratio
   L.  Tx   -- Transmit

2.3  Structure

   The NG ADSL Line MIB contains the following MIB group:

   To be added
     
2.4  Persistence

   All read-create objects defined in this MIB module SHOULD be stored
   persistently.  Following is an exhaustive list of these persistent
   objects:
   
   To be added                   

   Note also that the interface indices in this MIB are maintained
   persistently.  View-based Access Control Model (VACM) data
   relating to these SHOULD be stored persistently as well [RFC3415].

3.  Conformance and Compliance

   To be added

6.  Security Considerations

   To be added

 

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of a MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.



7.  IANA Considerations
   The IANA is kindly requested to assign the value of the 
   MODULE-IDENTITY.  The authors suggest transmission 227, 
   see section 4.
