   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) as Transport for Session
                   Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)
                      draft-ietf-tram-stun-dtls-03

Abstract

   This document specifies the usage of Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) as a transport protocol for Session Traversal
   Utilities for NAT (STUN).  It provides guidances on when and how to
   use DTLS with the currently standardized STUN Usages.  It also
   specifies modifications to the STUN URIs and TURN URIs and to the
   TURN resolution mechanism to facilitate the resolution of STUN URIs
   and TURN URIs into the IP address and port of STUN and TURN servers
   supporting DTLS as a transport protocol.

Internet-Draft               TURN over DTLS                     May 2014


1.  Introduction

   STUN [RFC5389] defines Transport Layer Security (TLS) over TCP
   (simply referred to as TLS [RFC5246]) as the transport for STUN due
   to additional security advantages it offers over plain UDP or TCP
   transport.  But TLS-over-TCP is not an optimal transport when STUN is
   used for its originally intended purpose, which is to support
   multimedia sessions.  This sub-optimality primarily stems from the
   added latency incurred by the TCP-based head-of-line (HOL) blocking
   problem coupled with additional TLS buffering (for integrity checks).
   This is a well documented and understood transport limitation for
   secure real-time communications.

   TLS-over-UDP (referred to as DTLS [RFC6347]) offers the same security
   advantages as TLS-over-TCP, but without the undesirable latency
   concerns.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] when
   they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in ALL CAPS (such
   as "must" or "Must"), they have their usual English meanings, and are
   not to be interpreted as RFC 2119 key words.

3.  DTLS as Transport for STUN

   STUN [RFC5389] defines three transports: UDP, TCP, and TLS.  This
   document adds DTLS as a valid transport for STUN.

   STUN over DTLS MUST use the same retransmission rules as STUN over
   UDP (as described in Section 7.2.1 of [RFC5389]).  It MUST also use
   the same rules that are described in Section 7.2.2 of [RFC5389] to
   verify the server identity.  Instead of TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,
   which is the default cipher suite for STUN over TLS, STUN over DTLS,
   at a minimum, MUST support TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and
   MUST support TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256.  STUN over DTLS
   MUST prefer TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and any other
   Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) cipher suites over non-PFS cipher
   suites.  The same rules established in Section 7.2.2 of [RFC5389] for
   keeping open and closing TCP/TLS connections MUST be used as well for
   DTLS associations.

   In addition to the path MTU rules described in Section 7.1 of
   [RFC5389], if the path MTU is unknown, the actual STUN message needs
   to be adjusted to take into account the size of the (13-byte) DTLS
   Record header, the MAC size, the padding size and the eventual
   compression applied to the payload.

Internet-Draft               TURN over DTLS                     May 2014


   By default, STUN over DTLS MUST use port 5349, the same port as STUN
   over TLS.  However, the SRV procedures can be implemented to use a
   different port (as described in Section 9 of [RFC5389]).  When using
   SRV records, the service name MUST be set to "stuns" and the
   application name to "udp".

   Classic STUN [RFC3489] defines only UDP as a transport and DTLS MUST
   NOT be used.  Any STUN request or indication without the magic cookie
   over DTLS MUST always result in an error.

4.  STUN Usages

   [RFC5389] Section 7.2 states that STUN usages must specify which
   transport protocol is used.  The following sections discuss if and
   how the existing STUN usages are used with DTLS as the transport.
   Future STUN usages MUST take into account DTLS as a transport and
   discuss its applicability.

4.1.  NAT Discovery Usage

   As stated by Section 13 of [RFC5389], "...TLS provides minimal
   security benefits..." for this particular STUN usage.  DTLS will also
   similarly offer only limited benefit.  This is because the only
   mandatory attribute that is TLS/DTLS protected is the XOR-MAPPED-
   ADDRESS, which is already known by an on-path attacker, since it is
   the same as the source address and port of the STUN request.  On the
   other hand, using TLS/DTLS will prevent an active attacker to inject
   XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS in responses.  The TLS/DTLS transport will also
   protect the SOFTWARE attribute, which can be used to find
   vulnerabilities in STUN implementations.

   Regardless, this usage is rarely used by itself, since using TURN
   [RFC5766] with ICE [RFC5245] is generally indispensable, and TURN
   provides the same NAT Discovery feature as part of an Allocation
   creation.  In fact, with ICE, the NAT Discovery usage is only used
   when there is no longer any resource available for new Allocations in
   the TURN server.

4.1.1.  DTLS Support in STUN URIs

   This document does not make any changes to the syntax of a STUN URI
   [RFC7064].  As indicated in Section 3.2 of [RFC7064], secure
   transports like STUN over TLS, and now STUN over DTLS, MUST use the
   "stuns" URI scheme.

   The <host> value MUST be used when using the rules in Section 7.2.2
   of [RFC5389] to verify the server identity.  A STUN URI containing an
   IP address MUST be rejected, unless the domain is provided by the



Petit-Huguenin & SalgueiExpires December 1, 2014                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               TURN over DTLS                     May 2014


   same mechanism that provided the STUN URI, and that this domain name
   can be passed to the verification code.

4.2.  Connectivity Check Usage

   Using DTLS would hide the USERNAME, PRIORITY, USE-CANDIDATE, ICE-
   CONTROLLED and ICE-CONTROLLING attributes.  But because MESSAGE-
   INTEGRITY protects the entire STUN response using a password that is
   known only by looking at the SDP exchanged, it is not possible for an
   attacker to inject an incorrect XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS, which would
   subsequently be used as a peer reflexive candidate.

   Adding DTLS on top of the connectivity check would delay, and
   consequently impair, the ICE process.  There is, in fact, a proposal
   ([I-D.thomson-rtcweb-ice-dtls]) to use the DTLS handshake used by the
   WebRTC SRTP streams as a replacement for the connectivity checks,
   proving that adding additional round-trips to ICE is undesirable.

   STUN URIs are not used with this usage.

4.3.  Media Keep-Alive Usage

   The media keep-alive (described in Section 10 of [RFC5245]) runs
   alongside an RTP or RTCP session.  It is possible to send the media
   keep-alive packets inside a separately negotiated non-SRTP DTLS
   session if DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764] is used, but that would add overhead,
   with minimal security benefit.

   STUN URIs are not used with this usage.

4.4.  SIP Keep-Alive Usage

   The SIP keep-alive (described in [RFC5626]) runs inside a SIP flow.
   This flow would be protected if a SIP over DTLS transport mechanism
   is implemented (such as described in [I-D.jennings-sip-dtls]).

   STUN URIs are not used with this usage.

4.5.  NAT Behavior Discovery Usage

   The NAT Behavior Discovery usage is Experimental and to date has
   never being effectively deployed.  Despite this, using DTLS would add
   the same security properties as for the NAT Discovery Usage
   (Section 4.1).

   The STUN URI can be used to access the NAT Discovery feature of a NAT
   Behavior Discovery server, but accessing the full features would

Internet-Draft               TURN over DTLS                     May 2014


   require definition of a "stun-behaviors:" URI, which is out of scope
   for this document.

4.6.  TURN Usage

   TURN [RFC5766] defines three combinations of transports/allocations:
   UDP/UDP, TCP/UDP and TLS/UDP.  This document adds DTLS/UDP as a valid
   combination.  A TURN server using DTLS MUST implement the denial-of-
   service counter-measure described in Section 4.2.1 of [RFC6347].

   [RFC6062] states that TCP allocations cannot be obtained using a UDP
   association between client and server.  The fact that DTLS uses UDP
   implies that TCP allocations MUST NOT be obtained using a DTLS
   association between client and server.

   By default, TURN over DTLS uses port 5349, the same port as TURN over
   TLS.  However, the SRV procedures can be implemented to use a
   different port (as described in Section 6 of [RFC5766].  When using
   SRV records, the service name MUST be set to "turns" and the
   application name to "udp".

4.6.1.  DTLS Support in TURN URIs

   This document does not make any changes to the syntax of a TURN URI
   [RFC7065].  As indicated in Section 3 of [RFC7065], secure transports
   like TURN over TLS, and now TURN over DTLS, MUST use the "turns" URI
   scheme.  When using the "turns" URI scheme to designate TURN over
   DTLS, the transport value of the TURN URI, if set, MUST be "udp".

   The <host> value MUST be used when using the rules in Section 7.2.2
   of [RFC5389] to verify the server identity.  A TURN URI containing an
   IP address MUST be rejected, unless the domain is provided by the
   same mechanism that provided the TURN URI, and that this domain name
   can be passed to the verification code.

4.6.2.  Resolution Mechanism for TURN over DTLS

   This document defines a new Straightforward Naming Authority Pointer
   (S-NAPTR) application protocol tag: "turn.dtls".

   The <transport> component, as provisioned or resulting from the
   parsing of a TURN URI, is passed without modification to the TURN
   resolution mechanism defined in Section 3 of [RFC5928], but with the
   following alterations to that algorithm:

   o  The acceptable values for transport name are extended with the
      addition of "dtls".




Petit-Huguenin & SalgueiExpires December 1, 2014                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               TURN over DTLS                     May 2014


   o  The acceptable values in the ordered list of supported TURN
      transports is extended with the addition of "Datagram Transport
      Layer Security (DTLS)".

   o  The resolution algorithm check rules list is extended with the
      addition of the following step:

         If <secure> is true and <transport> is defined as "udp" but the
         list of TURN transports supported by the application does not
         contain DTLS, then the resolution MUST stop with an error.

   o  The 5th rule of the resolution algorithm check rules list is
      modified to read like this:

         If <secure> is true and <transport> is not defined but the list
         of TURN transports supported by the application does not
         contain TLS or DTLS, then the resolution MUST stop with an
         error.

   o  Table 1 is modified to add the following line:

                +----------+-------------+----------------+
                | <secure> | <transport> | TURN Transport |
                +----------+-------------+----------------+
                | true     | "udp"       | DTLS           |
                +----------+-------------+----------------+

   o  In step 1 of the resolution algorithm the default port for DTLS is
      5349.

   o  In step 4 of the resolution algorithm the following is added to
      the list of conversions between the filtered list of TURN
      transports supported by the application and application protocol
      tags:

         "turn.dtls" is used if the TURN transport is DTLS.

   Note that using the [RFC5928] resolution mechanism does not imply
   that additional round trips to the DNS server will be needed (e.g.,
   the TURN client will start immediately if the TURN URI contains an IP
   address).

6.  Security Considerations

   STUN over DTLS as a STUN transport does not introduce any specific
   security considerations beyond those for STUN over TLS detailed in
   [RFC5389].

   The usage of "udp" as a transport parameter with the "stuns" URI
   scheme does not introduce any specific security issues beyond those
   discussed in [RFC7064].

   TURN over DTLS as a TURN transport does not introduce any specific
   security considerations beyond those for TURN over TLS detailed in
   [RFC5766].

   The usage of "udp" as a transport parameter with the "turns" URI
   scheme does not introduce any specific security issues beyond those
   discussed in [RFC7065].

   The new S-NAPTR application protocol tag defined in this document as
   well as the modifications this document makes to the TURN resolution
   mechanism described in [RFC5928] do not introduce any additional
   security considerations beyond those outlined in [RFC5928].

Internet-Draft               TURN over DTLS                     May 2014


Appendix A.  Examples

   Table 1 shows how the <secure>, <port> and <transport> components are
   populated for a TURN URI that uses DTLS as its transport.  For all
   these examples, the <host> component is populated with "example.net".

   +---------------------------------+----------+--------+-------------+
   | URI                             | <secure> | <port> | <transport> |
   +---------------------------------+----------+--------+-------------+
   | turns:example.net?transport=udp | true     |        | DTLS        |
   +---------------------------------+----------+--------+-------------+

                                  Table 1

   With the DNS RRs in Figure 1 and an ordered TURN transport list of
   {DTLS, TLS, TCP, UDP}, the resolution algorithm will convert the TURN
   URI "turns:example.net" to the ordered list of IP address, port, and
   protocol tuples in Table 2.

   example.net.
   IN NAPTR 100 10 "" RELAY:turn.udp:turn.dtls "" datagram.example.net.
   IN NAPTR 200 10 "" RELAY:turn.tcp:turn.tls "" stream.example.net.

   datagram.example.net.
   IN NAPTR 100 10 S RELAY:turn.udp "" _turn._udp.example.net.
   IN NAPTR 100 10 S RELAY:turn.dtls "" _turns._udp.example.net.

   stream.example.net.
   IN NAPTR 100 10 S RELAY:turn.tcp "" _turn._tcp.example.net.
   IN NAPTR 200 10 A RELAY:turn.tls "" a.example.net.

   _turn._udp.example.net.
   IN SRV   0 0 3478 a.example.net.

   _turn._tcp.example.net.
   IN SRV   0 0 5000 a.example.net.

   _turns._udp.example.net.
   IN SRV   0 0 5349 a.example.net.

Appendix B.  Release notes

   This section must be removed before publication as an RFC.

B.1.  Modifications between ietf-tram-stun-dtls-02 and ietf-tram-stun-
      dtls-03

   o  Make it clear that both cipher suites are mandatory.

   o  Clarify that the ciphers suites listed are replacing the TLS
      cipher suites.

   o  Change text so "mandatory" is not understood as compliance.

   o  Clarify that STUN URI are not to be used with some usages.

   o  Fix incorrect interpretation of ICE media keep-alive (and fixed
      section #).

   o  Explain that sending media keep-alive inside DTLS is possible if
      RFC 5764 is used.

   o  Added title/subtitle of IANA registries.

   o  Change to normatively update RFC 5389 and RFC 5928.

B.2.  Modifications between ietf-tram-stun-dtls-01 and ietf-tram-stun-
      dtls-02

   o  Add text saying that PFS is preferred over non-PFS, to be in sync
      with the decision in the rtcweb session in London.

   o  Add text about IP address in STUN/TURN URIs.

   o  Nits

B.3.  Modifications between ietf-tram-stun-dtls-00 and ietf-tram-stun-
      dtls-01

   o  Update the mandatory cipher suites.

   o  Add a new open item to determine if we want to specify favoring
      cipher suites which support PFS over non-PFS cipher suites.

   o  Close remaining opening items from previous draft.

B.4.  Modifications between petithuguenin-tram-stun-dtls-00 and ietf-
      tram-stun-dtls-00

   o  Draft renamed after WG adoption.

B.5.  Modifications between petithuguenin-tram-turn-dtls-00 and
      petithuguenin-tram-stun-dtls-00

   o  Add RFC 6982 information for rfc5766-turn-server project.

   o  Rename the draft as TURN is now just one of the usages.

   o  Remove the references in the abstract to make idnits happy.

   o  No longer updates other standard drafts.

   o  Rewrite from a STUN over DTLS point of view.  The previous text
      becomes section 4.6.

   o  Add IANA request for stuns port.

   o  Add acknowledgement section.
