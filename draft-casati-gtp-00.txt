Abstract

   Some discussion has been lately going on on the standardization of
   GRE within the IETF. GRE has an Impact on standard track protocols
   such as Mobile IP. A Generic Tunneling Protocol (GTP) sharing the
   same format and byte order of the 3GPP GTP protocol ( 3G TS 29.060)
   benefits from the commonality of the encapsulation format used in IP
   mobility support protocols in different families of 3G standards.


1. GTP HEADER

   The GTP header is a variable length header.  It is used to encapulate
   packets over any network layer or transport layer protocol (e.g.
   it can be transported over UDP/IP, in which case it SHALL use port

   number TBD [Note:-likely to be the 3386 port, currently allocated to
   GTP defined by 3GPP]).

   Two flags signal the presence of optional fields:  the R flag and
   the S flag.  The R flag is used to signal the need to interpret
   the Reserved/Experimental field.  The S flag is used to signal the
   presence of the GTP Sequence Number field.

   If any of these flags are set, the length of the header is 12 octets
   and the fields corresponding to the flags that are set SHALL be
   evaluated by the receiver.  The bits marked with '*' are currently
   unused and reserved for experimental use and they MUST not be
   interpreted.

    -  The version field value is the version of the GTP protocol.  This
       document specifies GTP version 1.

    -  The type field defines possible different uses of the GTP. It
       shall be set to 0XFF when user traffic is transported.

    -  The length Field defines the length of the GTP encapsulated
       packet (that is the length of the user datagram encasulated using
       the GTP protocol).

    -  The Tunnel Identifier field is used as a multiplexing field.

    -  The Sequence number field defines the value of the sequence
       number of the GTP encapsulated data.  This field is present and
       SHALL be interpreted when the S Flag is set to 1.

    -  The Resv/Exp field is present and SHALL be interpreted when the R
       flag is set to 1.
