1.  Introduction

   DKIM [RFC6376] defines a cryptographic header field consisting of a
   series of tags and values.  The values include signed hashes of some
   of the header fields and part or all of the body of a message.  The
   signature contains a domain name that is responsible for the
   signature.  The signature is valid if the hashes in the signature
   match the hashes of the header fields and body, the signature is
   valid under a public key retrieved from that responsible domain's
   DNS, and it is before the expiration time in the signature header
   field.

   This specification defines a new signature with tags that enable a
   signature header field to specify additional conditions that must be
   specified for a signature to be valid.  A typical condition would be
   to require the presence of an additional signature from a specified
   different domain.

2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The ABNF terms "ALPHA", "FWS", and "domain-name" are used as in
   [RFC6376].

3.  The CDKIM signature

   A CDKIM signature is identical to a DKIM signature as defined in
   [RFC6376] except that the header field starts with "CDKIM-Signature"
   rather than "DKIM-Signature", and each signature MUST include a "cs="
   tag.

4.  CDKIM header tags

   cs=  A list of condition strings, each identifying a condition that
      must be satisfied for the signature to be valid.  The initial list
      of condition strings is described below, and placed in the new
      CDKIM-Signature Condition String registry.  A verifier MUST check
      that the condition for each condition string is satisfied.  If any
      of the conditions are not satisfied, or any of the condition
      strings are unknown to the verifier, it MUST report that the
      signature is not valid.

   fs=  A list of forwarding signers.  A forwarding signer is a domain
      name, or the letter "t" meaning any of the domain names in
      addresses in the To header field, or the letter "c" meaning any of
      the domain names in addresses in the Cc header field.  If the tag
      includes "t" or "c", the signature SHOULD include the To or Cc
      header field, respectively.

         ABNF:

         sig-cs-tag       = %x63 %x73 [FWS] "=" [FWS] sig-cs-tag-list

         sig-cs-tag-list = sig-cs-condition 0*( "," sig-cs-condition )

         sig-cs-condition = 1*ALPHA

         sig-fs-tag       = %x63 %x73 [FWS] "=" [FWS] sig-fs-tag-list

         sig-cs-tag-list = sig-fs-signer 0*( "," sig-fs-signer )

         sig-fs-signer = "t" | "c" | domain-name

5.  Condition strings

   This specification defines one condition string and an IANA registry
   to which future condition strings may be added.

5.1.  Forward signature (fs)

   The "fs" condition string means that the signature is only valid if
   an additional signature is present in the message.  There MUST be a
   fs= tag specifying the domains for the additional signature.  The
   condition is satisfied if the message includes at least one valid
   DKIM signature header field with responsible domain (the d= tag)
   being one from the list in the fs= tag.

6.  Typical application scenario

   A sender that expects a message to be forwarded might put both a
   conventional DKIM signature and a CDKIM signature that refers to the
   domain name of the expected forwarder.  The forwarder uses the
   conventional signature to assess the message, edits the message, and
   then signs the outgoing message with its own signature.  Subsequent
   recipients observe both the forwarder's signature and the conditional
   signature with a fs= tag that matches the other signature, and use
   either or both to assess the message.  If a message arrives with a
   conditional signature but no forwarding signature, the recipient
   would ignore the conditional signature.  The conditional signature
   would typically be a "weak" signature that does not cover the Subject
   header or the message body, so that it would remain valid even if the
   forwarder makes changes typical of forwarders such as mailing lists.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create the "CDKIM-Signature Tag Specifications"
   registry and populate it with these tags.

                    +------+-----------------+--------+
                    | TYPE | REFERENCE       | STATUS |
                    +------+-----------------+--------+
                    |  cs  | (this document) | active |
                    |  fs  | (this document) | active |
                    +------+-----------------+--------+

                Table 1: CDKIM-Signature Tag Specifications

   IANA is requested to add these entries to the "DKIM-Signature Tag
   Specifications" registry, in order to prevent future collisions with
   the cs= and fs= tags.

                   +------+-----------------+----------+
                   | TYPE | REFERENCE       | STATUS   |
                   +------+-----------------+----------+
                   |  cs  | (this document) | reserved |
                   |  fs  | (this document) | reserved |
                   +------+-----------------+----------+

           Table 2: DKIM-Signature Tag Specifications additions

   IANA is requested to create a new "CDKIM-Signature Condition String"
   registry, with the following initial contents.

8.  Security Considerations

   DKIM was designed to provide assurances that a message with a valid
   signature was received in essentially the same form that it was sent.
   The CDKIM forwarding signature condition deliberately circumvents
   that design, to create a loophole for messages intended to be
   forwarded by entities that edit the message.  It opens up a variety
   of obvious replay attacks that may or may not be important depending
   on both the selection of target domains for messages to be forwarded,
   and the behavior of forwarders that receive messages with conditional
   signatures.
