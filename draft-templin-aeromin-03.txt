                      draft-templin-aeromin-03.txt

Abstract

   Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO) specifies both a
   control messaging and data packet forwarding facility for managing
   tunnels over an enterprise network or other Internetwork.  Although
   AERO can operate with any tunnel encapsulation format, the base
   document considers Generic UDP Encapsulation (GUE) as the default.
   This document presents minimal encapsulation formats for AERO using
   other encapsulation types.

1.  Introduction

   Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO) [I-D.templin-aerolink]
   specifies both a control messaging and data packet forwarding
   facility for forwarding Internet Protocol (IP) packets [RFC0791]
   [RFC2460] over an enterprise network or other Internetwork through a
   process known as tunneling.  Although AERO can operate with any
   tunnel encapsulation format, the base document specifies the
   insertion of a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) header [RFC0768] between
   the inner and outer IP headers per the Generic UDP Encapsulation
   (GUE) [I-D.ietf-nvo3-gue] specification.  This document presents
   minimal encapsulation formats for AERO using other encapsulation
   types.

   AERO can use common minimal encapsulations such as IP-in-IP
   [RFC2003][RFC2473][RFC4213], Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)
   [RFC2784][RFC2890] and others.  The encapsulation is therefore only
   differentiated from non-AERO tunnels through the application of AERO
   control messaging.

   In certain use cases, AERO minimal encapsulation formats may require
   encapsulation layer fragmentation in the same manner as for GUE
   fragmentation [I-D.herbert-gue-fragmentation] . For simple IP-in-IP
   encapsulation, an IPv6 fragment header is inserted directly between
   the inner and outer IP headers when needed, i.e., even if the outer
   header is IPv4.  The IPv6 Fragment Header is identified to the outer
   IP layer by its IP protocol number, and the Next Header field in the
   IPv6 Fragment Header identifies the inner IP header version.  For GRE
   encapsulation, a GRE fragment header is inserted within the GRE
   header [I-D.templin-intarea-grefrag].

   GRE encapsulation can be used instead of simple IP-in-IP
   encapsulation when GRE facilities such as keys and checksums are
   desired.  In that case, AERO can include a GRE fragment header in the
   encapsulation [I-D.templin-intarea-grefrag] as shown in Figure 2:

3.  When to Insert an Encapsulation Fragment Header

   An encapsulation fragment header is inserted when the AERO tunnel
   ingress needs to apply fragmentation to accommodate packets that must
   be delivered without loss due to a size restriction.  Fragmentation
   is performed on the inner packet while encapsulating each inner
   packet fragment in identical outer IP and encapsulation layer
   headers.

   The fragment header can also be inserted in order to include a
   coherent Identification value with each packet, e.g., to aid in
   Duplicate Packet Detection (DPD).  In this way, network nodes can
   cache the Identification values of recently-seen packets and use the
   cached values to determine whether a newly-arrived packet is in fact
   a duplicate.  The Identification value within each packet could
   further provide a rough indicator of packet reordering, e.g., in
   cases when the tunnel egress wishes to discard packets that are
   grossly out of order.

   In some use cases, there may be operational assurance that no
   fragmentation of any kind will be necessary, or that only occasional
   large control messages will require fragmentation.  In that case, the
   encapsulation fragment header can be omitted and ordinary
   fragmentation of the outer IP protocol version can be applied when
   necessary.

4.  Considerations for Using Minimal Encapsulation

   Minimal encapsulation is preferred in environments where GUE
   encapsulation would add unnecessary overhead.  For example, certain
   low-bandwidth wireless data links may benefit from a reduced
   encapsulation overhead.  This is not likely to be a prime
   consideration for many modern wireless data links nor for most modern
   wired-line data links.

   GUE encapsulation can traverse network paths that are inaccessible to
   minimal encapsulation, e.g., for crossing Network Address Translators
   (NATs).  More and more, network middleboxes are also being configured
   to discard packets that include anything other than a well-known IP
   protocol such as UDP and TCP.  It may therefore be necessary to
   determine the potential for middlebox filtering before enabling
   minimal encapsulation in a given environment.

5.  AERO Operation Over Native Links

   AERO can also operate over native links using no encapsulation at
   all.  In that case, AERO Clients can identify AERO Servers on the
   link through their link-layer addresses, and the AERO prefix
   delegation, mobility management, fault tolerance and route
   optimization facilities operate on the native link the same as over
   an NBMA tunnel overlay.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces no IANA considerations.

7.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are discussed in the base AERO specification
   [I-D.templin-aerolink].
