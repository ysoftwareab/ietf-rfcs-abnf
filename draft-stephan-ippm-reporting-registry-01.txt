Internet-Draft           IPPM Reporting Registry              March 2007


1.  Introduction

   The IPPM WG is working on numerous topics such as the definition of
   composition of metrics [I-D.ietf-ippm-spatial-composition] and a
   composition framework [I-D.ietf-ippm-framework-compagg] ; the
   selection of metrics and parameters for reporting IP Performance
   metrics to users and end users
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-reporting],[I-D.shalunov-ippm-reporting] and
   [I-D.morton-ippm-reporting-metrics]; the storage of an end-user
   metric not defined by the IPPM WG
   [I-D.niccolini-ippm-storetraceroutes].

   The intend of this memo is to set up an IANA registry that collects
   best current practices in terms of reporting IP Performance Metrics
   (IPPM) measurements for composition, to users and to end-users.  It
   proposes default values for well known usages and focuses on the
   identification of the information that should be reported to increase
   the usability of standard metrics measurements results by users
   measurement applications.

   This memo focuses on the usage so interoperability between
   measurement systems or probes is out of the scope.  The word 'user'
   means 2 things:
      someone or some application who is external to the measure and
      doesn't have access to implicit information which disapears after
      the measure;
      someone or some application who is not a specialist of the
      measurement but of the usage of the results.

   Such a registry will facilitate the WG activity because working on
   one metric application will not preclude to work later on other
   applications of the same metric and on application of metrics being
   currently defined in the future.  As an example defining a default
   packet size for general usage will not preclude to add later a
   default packet size for a general application.

   The content of the reporting registry provides relevant information
   such as metrics applicability, default values for a metric, default
   values for a specific application.  These pieces of informations are
   are minor points for IPPM gurus but are still mysterious for other
   experts, users and obvioulsy end-users.

   Each metric application described in the registry gives best current
   practice in terms of default values and reporting of parameters and
   results and may include a default info model human readable and
   machine readable.

   This memo firstly motivates the need of a IPPM reporting registry,

   then it introduces the differents part of the reporting registry.
   Section 4 presents end-users metrics to register in the IANA-IPPM-
   METRICS-REGISTRY.  Section 5 provides the initial version of the IPPM
   reporting registry.  The management of the registry is described is
   the 'IANA considerations' section.

2.  Motivation

   The IPPM WG has defined 45 metrics including [RFC4737].  They are
   based on [RFC2330] methodology.  Definitions clearly distinguish raw
   measure (singleton), from set of measures over a period a time
   (streams) and from statistics.  To go further in reporting metrics it
   is necessary to classify each metric in terms of applicability.  This
   point is presented in section 3.2 and a first classification is given
   in section 5.1 for 'composition', 'user' and 'end user' metrics.  As
   a metric does not belong exclusively to one category, the
   classification may be enhanced over time.

   A metric based on RFC2330 defines a mathematic model for measuring
   network behavior aspects which may have several valid practical
   methods.  This memo identifies these metrics and gives the list of
   the current methods in use.This list will be complimented over time.

   Metrics based on RFC2330 don't provide common use cases.
   Consequently parameters default values of they parameters are not
   clearly identified.  This memo proposes default values per categories
   of current usages.  This list will be complimented over time.

   Composition of metrics intrinsically relies on collection of results
   performed by remote measurement systems and requires the share of the
   set of metrics that may be combined and the share of parameters that
   should be exchange.  This point is discussed in section 3.4 and sets
   of metrics that may be combined are given in section 5.4.

   Reporting metrics measurement results to users require the
   identification of a set of metrics that may be reported and requires
   the definition of the parameters and of the results that should
   reported.  This point is discussed in section 3.4 and sets of metrics
   that may be reported to user are given in section 5.5.

   Reporting metrics measurement results to end-users require the
   identification of a set of metrics easy to understand and relevant to
   end-user applications.  This point is discussed in section 3.4 and a
   first specification metrics that may be reported to end-users are
   given in section 5.6.

   Reporting implicitly leads to exchange information.  So the need of a
   common and protocol neutral info model is discuted in section 3.3.

3.  Presentation of the registry

   The registry is designed to collect best current practice in terms of
   reporting metric application.  Application may the domain of
   applicability of a metrics like raw measure or a real application
   like VoIP. this approach permits to define metric reporting
   parameters at a global level (i.e any Type-P) or/and for a dedicaced
   application (i.e.  VoIP) without having any collision in the best
   practices registered.

   A default metric application gives the default values as per
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-reporting].

   The registration of the reporting of a metric application (sections
   2, 3 of the registry) includes the description of configurations and
   results information.  It may look like section ' 5.2.1.
   Configuration Information Elements' and section ' 5.2.2.  Results
   Information Elements' of[I-D.niccolini-ippm-storetraceroutes].

3.1.  Registry

   The registry is designed to be supplemented in the future with
   default values and parameters of new metric applications.

   Registrations are done by IANA on the bases of 'Specification
   Required' as defined in [RFC2434].

3.2.  Initial version of the registry

   It is in the spirit of this registry to limit the number of initial
   metric applications.  So it focuses on 6 metrics usages like
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-reporting] but not on the same:
      Composition of metrics to compute an ietfCompOneWayDelayMedian
      metric;
      Composition of metrics to compute an ietfOneWayPktLossAverage
      metric;
      Default values for the usage of ietfOneWayDelayMedian for VoIP;
      Default values for the usage of ietfOneWayPktLossAverage for VoIP;
      Usage of VoIP ground-truth End-user metrics: MOS and R-Factor.

3.3.  Metrics classification part

   This part classifies metrics in terms of application. the criteria
   are 'raw measure', 'collection', 'network expert', 'user',
   'composition' and 'end-user'.  A metric may belong to several
   criteria.  The usage fo each metrics is then described per criteria.

Internet-Draft           IPPM Reporting Registry              March 2007


3.4.  Info model part

   The info model part of the registry defines the information to report
   per metric application.

   The info model of composition of metrics must be machine readable to
   help machine-to-machine reporting using NSIS WG model implementation
   or PSAMP WG passive measurement with IPFIX protocols...

   The info model of user and end-users metrics must intrinsically be
   human readable.  Furthermore it must be machine readable to
   facilitate the reporting with technics like Web service.

   The best way to help machine-to-machine communication consists in
   defining the information in a protocol neutral langage like XML.

3.4.1.  data type

   Atomic informations to report correspond to parameters described in
   IPPM metrics definitions.

   The data part of the registry defines a flat list of data type
   corresponding to parameters described in IPPM metrics definitions.

   A data type is defined as per section 5.1 of
   [I-D.niccolini-ippm-storetraceroutes] and may reuse data types
   already defined in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] and in
   [I-D.ietf-psamp-info].

3.5.  Reporting rules and parameters

   The report of parameters and results is defined per metric
   application i.e. in the composition part, in the user part or in the
   end-user part of the registry.

   To help machine-to-machine communication the definition parameters
   and results may be defined in a XML schema as per section "6.  Data
   Model for Storing Traceroute Measurements" of
   [I-D.niccolini-ippm-storetraceroutes] .

3.5.1.  Reporting for composition part

   This part of the registry identifies sets of metrics that may be
   composed.  Then it gives the parameters and the results for reporting
   metrics per metric.

3.5.2.  Reporting for users and end-users part

   This part of the registry gives per user metric the parameters and
   the results to report for each relevant metrics and application.

   This part of the registry the parameters and the results to report
   per user and end-user metric.

4.  End-user metrics to register

   This section presents several well-known metrics that must be
   registered in the IANA-IPPM-METRICS-REGISTRY because they are
   intensively used by end-users to monitor the behavior and the
   performance of the network or of their application.

   The request of registration is given in 'IANA Considerations'
   section.

4.1.  traceroute

   As IPPM WG is defining the storage of traceroute measurement results
   in [I-D.niccolini-ippm-storetraceroutes] the metric traceroute must
   be registered in the IANA IPPM METRICS REGISTRY.  Furthermore the
   section 5 of this draft gives the information elements for the
   configuration and for the result of traceroute measurement.  These
   informations elements should be used in the registry for describing
   the report of a traceroute to end-user.

4.2.  metric to measure VoIP quality

4.2.1.  ituTrFactorEmodel

   The R Factor is the output of the E-model planning tool defined in
   ITU-T G.107.Its value is ranged between 0 and 100.  Based on the
   individual values of several transmission parameters (given by
   measurements or by default values), it permits an estimation of the
   end-to-end transmission quality of voice calls as perceived by end-
   users.  Depending on the fact that delay and echo are taken into
   account or not in the computation, the E-model R factors can be
   translated into MOS-CQEN or MOS-LQEN (according to ITU-T P.800.1
   terminology).

4.2.2.  itutMosLqon

   PESQ (perceptual evaluation of speech quality) is the trademark name
   Associated with ITU-T P.862.

   This psychoacoustical (i.e. based on the analysis of speech signal
   characteristics) intrusive (i.e. needing the sending of a reference
   signal) model, associated with the mapping function defined in ITU-T
   P.862.1, allows the determination of MOS-LQON scores(according to
   ITU-T P.800.1 terminology), which is a metric very well correlated
   with human perception of end-to-end quality of voice calls.
   Alternative ways for the determination of MOS-LQON scores are ITU-T
   standard P.563 and P.564, based on non-intrusive (i.e. passive)
   measures, respectively on speech signal and RTP/UDP/IP packets

   information.

4.3.  Discussion on End user metrics registration

   Metrics measuring VoIP quality are orthogonale to IPPM metrics
   because the mesure include not only codecs but give a quality as
   perceived by an end-user.

   At large registering ITU-T metrics close to IPPM ones would help to
   distinguish measurement made using different methodology.

5.  IPPM Reporting Registry

   This section defines the initial version of the registry to be
   maintained by IANA.

5.1.  Metrics classification

   Following is a table of the classification of each metric according
   to its applicability.

   Editor note: all the metric are not present.  Do we need a
   'estimation' category ?

   'ID' is the number IANA assigned to the metric.

   'Name' is the name the editor of the RFC assigned to the metric.

5.1.1.  Metrics measurement methods

   # Several methods are applicable to perform IPDV measurement results.
   The drawback is that the results are not comparable.

   # The measurement method must be reported to avoid misunderstanding .

   ietfOneWayIpdv
      PDV1: fixed reference of time
      PDV2: floating reference of time
      IPDV: absolute reference of time

5.2.  raw measure Metrics

   Reporting such metrics results it out of the scope of the memo
   because reporting singletons is an internal task of a measurement
   system.

   Nevertheless the usage of metrics results require the knowmledge of

   Some metrics, like delay variation, have multiple well-known
   measuring approachs while relying on the same definition.

   some metrics measures e distinguishing well-known measuring approach
   of the same singleton metric :hat is to propose reporting information
   to identify these differences.

5.3.  collection metrics

   Collection of metrics are connected to various usages.

   Collection of singleton metrics results (stream) of the same measure
   is mostly internal to measurement systems.  Reporting such metrics
   results it out of the scope of the memo because reporting singletons
   is an internal task of a measurement system.  That does not preclude
   to adress this point later in the registry.

   On the other hand, collection of different metrics results of
   different mesures, spatial metrics, composition metrics and multicast
   one-to-group metrics, are mostly designed to be exchanged between
   measurement applications.  As they have specific constraints they are
   adressed in individual sections.

5.4.  Metrics for compositions

   This section gives the metrics a composition metric may be composed
   of.  Then it gives the parameters and results a metric measure must
   provide to participate to a composition.  Then it gives the
   parameters a composition metric must report.

   Following is the list of composition metrics (NOTE WELL they are not
   yet defined: they are given only to determine which kind of
   information should be reported and which structure this part of the
   registry should have).

5.5.  Users metrics applications

   Most of user metrics become end-users metrics when applied to an end-
   user application.  Such metrics are covered in the section below.

   payload size to avoid mistake when encapsulation differs (i.e.  IP,
   IPv6...)

6.  Info Model

   Active measurement relies on the sending of packets from one source
   to one or more destinations.  From the network perspective these
   packets are a flow.  IPFIX WG has already modelized the information
   model of a flow [ADD REF].  Its info model provides most of the
   information required to describe the parameters of a measure.  PSAMP
   WG has already modelized per packet information model [ADD REF].
   This registry will reused fields and data types already defined in
   these information models to describe measure parameters and reports.

   These data models are managed by IANA on the bases of 'Specification
   Required' as defined in [RFC2434].  Consequently the missing fields
   and data types will be defined using the rules defines in the IANA
   section of these documents.

6.1.  Fields

   This section gives the definition of the fields used in the section
   above.  Most of them are already defined in IPFIX or PSAMP info
   models.

6.2.  data type

   This section gives the definition the data type used in the section
   above.  Most of them are already defined in IPFIX or PSAMP info
   models.

   They are designed to be managed by IANA.  So missing data types will
   be added using the rules they give in their IANA sections.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Management rules of the IPPM REPORTING REGISTRY

   Registrations are done by IANA on the basis of 'Specification
   Required', as defined in [RFC2434].

   A document that defines new metrics reporting rules would have an
   "IANA Considerations" section in which it would describe for each
   section of the registry the reporting aspects to be registered.

7.2.  End users metrics to register in IANA-IPPM-METRICS-REGISTRY

   IANA is asked to register the following metrics in the IANA-IPPM-
   METRICS-REGISTRY as described in [RFC4148] .

   ietfTraceRoute OBJECT-IDENTITY
      STATUS current
      DESCRIPTION

8.  Security Considerations

   Active measurement: see security section in owd pl, jitter rfcs
   (editor notes: add references).

   Active measurement:
      This method is based on the exchange of packets between one source
      and destinations.  Administrators should secure the configuration
      steps to avoid measurement systems to be abused for denial of
      service attacks.

   passive measurement:
      The generation of packets which match systematically the hash
      function may lead to a DoS attack toward the collector.
      The generation of packets with spoofing adresses may corrupt the
      results without any possibility to detect the spoofing.
   Collecting:

   collection of singletons of raw measure could overload the network
   the measurement controller is attach to.

   End user Data Confidentiality :
