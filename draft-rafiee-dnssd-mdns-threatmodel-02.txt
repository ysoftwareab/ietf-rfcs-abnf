INTERNET DRAFT                     mDNS Threat Model      March 22, 2015


1.  Introduction 

   Multicast DNS (mDNS) was proposed in [RFC6762] to allow nodes in 
   local links to use DNS-like names for their communication without the 
   need for global DNS servers, infrastructure and administration 
   processes for configuration. mDNS along with service discovery 
   (DNS-SD) [RFC6763] provides nodes with the possibility to discover 
   other services and the names of other nodes with zero configuration, 
   i.e., connect a node into a local link and use resources such as a 
   printer that are available in that network. 

   mDNS and service discovery (SD) use DNS- like query messages. The 
   main assumption is that these services also use DNS security 
   protocols such as DNSSEC. However, it cannot use DNSSEC for security 
   because DNSSEC is not zero configuration service. Therefore, it 
   cannot be used for Requirements A, B,C in [requirement]. Besides, 
   DNSSEC cannot be implemented in all nodes, especially nodes with 
   limited resources, e.g. 6LoWPAN [RFC4944]. This is why the existing 
   implementations use no security in local links. This might be not a 
   critical problem when the service was only advertised in local link 
   but it is not the same when the service is going to advertised over 
   layer 3 and in larger scope. Furthermore, during this step, DNS-SD 
   did not consider the impact of [RFC4193] that should be carefully 
   considered when using mDNS to populate DNS. As such, a Universal 
   Local Address (ULA) prefix is not to be advertised outside the 
   network domain. This is also similar to the scenario where address 
   preference rules employed by a proxy device as defined in section 
   2.4. [RFC7368]. 

   The purpose of this document is to introduce threat models for 
   service discovery and allow implementers to be aware of the possible 
   attacks in order to mitigate them with possible solutions. Since 
   there are already old lists of known DNS threats available in 
   [RFC3833], here we only analyze the ones that are applicable to 
   DNS-SD. We also introduce new possible threats that could result from 
   extending DNS-SD scope. 


2.  Terminology 

   Node: any host and routers in the network 

   Attack: an action to exploit a node and allow the attacker to gain 
   access to that node. It can be also an action to prevent a node from 
   providing a service or using a service on the network 

   Attacker: a person who uses any node in the network to attack other 
   nodes using known or unknown threats 

   Threat: Anything that has a potential to harm a node in the network 

   Local link vulnerability: Any flaws that are the result of the

INTERNET DRAFT                     mDNS Threat Model      March 22, 2015

   assumption that a malicious node could gain access to legitimate 
   nodes inside a local link network 

   Wide Area Network (WAN) vulnerability: Any flaws that are the result 
   of the assumption that a malicious node could gain access to 
   legitimate nodes inside any local links in an enterprise network with 
   multiple Local Area Networks (LANs) or Virtual LANs (VLANs). 

   Host name: Fully qualified DNS Name (FQDN) of a node in the network 

   Constrained device: a small device with limited resources (battery, 
   memory, etc.) 

   Service advertiser or service: a node that has a service to 
   advertise, e.g. a printer 

   Service Requester: a node in the network that requests a service by 
   the use of DNS-SD protocols. One example of service requester is a 
   computer that discovers a printer in the network and tries to use it. 


3.  Threat Analysis 

   Most threats in this section are a result of spoofing, Denial of 
   Service (DoS), or a combination of them. Here we explain them in 
   different example scenarios. The definition of different use case 
   scenarios are defined in [requirement]. 


3.1.  Human Mistakes 

   Human errors are well-known problems in computer systems that might 
   lead to serious service vulnerabilities and harm both security and 
   privacy. One example is the mus-configuration of DNS-SD scope that 
   might lead an attacker to gain access to services or expose the 
   network topology to outside of an administrative domains. This is 
   applicable to all scenarios including PAN, WPAN, home, enterprise, 
   campus, mesh networks. 


3.2.  DoS attack 


3.2.1.  Virus or Malware infection 

   When service advertiser and service requester are connected via a 
   network cable or USB (Personal Area Network), then the only threat is 
   virus or any malwares that might infect the service requester. The 
   virus or malware might cause corruptions on any software mediator , 
   e.g. a driver for printer. This will prevents the service requester 
   to gain access to resources in service advertiser. This is a kind of 
   DoS attack. 



Rafiee       Expires September 22, 2015                         [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT                     mDNS Threat Model      March 22, 2015

   Wireless PAN (WPAN) is where service advertiser and service requester 
   are connected via Bluetooth or wireless. Since WPANs are short range 
   and their coverage are usually limited, the attacker should be so 
   close to any of those nodes to be able to perform any attacks. If 
   this happens, the attacker might be able to forge the identity of the 
   service provider or perform DoS attack. 


3.2.2.  Large Traffic from mDNS gateway 

   There are several scenarios associated with the Large Traffic 
   Production case. 

   First scenario: a malicious node in any of the subnets that the 
   gateway connects can advertise different fake services or spoof the 
   information of the real services and replay the messages. This causes 
   large traffic either in the local link or in other links since the 
   gateway was also supposed to replicate the traffic to other links. 

   Second scenario : a malicious node spoofs the legitimate service 
   advertisements of different nodes in the network and changes the Time 
   To Leave (TTL) value to zero. This will result in producing large 
   traffic since the mDNS gateway needs to ask all of the service 
   advertisers to re-advertise their service. This is an especially 
   effective attack in a network of constrained devices because it 
   causes more energy consumption. 

   Third scenario: a malicious node can spoof the source IP address of a 
   legitimate victim node and question several services in the link. 
   This will result in a large traffic return to the victim node from 
   both gateway and also services. 


3.2.3.  Single point of failure 

   a service (like a printer) can overwhelmed with many service 
   discovery requests from a malicious service requester. This might 
   result in long waiting times (delay) for a legitimate node to receive 
   a service. 


3.3.  Node compromising  


3.3.1.  Home, Enterprise, Mesh networks 

   When the ISP, home router/gateway, and a service (like a printer) 
   support IPv6 addressing, these services may automatically announce 
   over mDNS both Universal Local Addresses (ULA) [RFC4193] and Global 
   Unicast Addresses (GUA). Since a GUA address is global, the 
   associated node may become accessible over the Internet. When the GUA 
   address for a service becomes known to an attacker, it might grant 
   unintended access to a service otherwise limited by boundaries

INTERNET DRAFT                     mDNS Threat Model      March 22, 2015

   imposed by mDNS discovery. 


3.4.  Spoofing Attacks & forge the Identity 


3.4.1.  Public Hotspot, Home, Enterprise, Mesh networks 

   Scenario 1: A malicious node can spoof the source IP address of a 
   legitimate victim node advertises fake services in the network. This 
   might result in compromising the victim nodes or gaining malicious 
   access to the victim nodes' resources. 

   Scenario2: A malicious node spoofs the content of Dynamic Host 
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server messages and offers its own 
   malicious information to the nodes in the network. 


3.4.2.  Enterprise network 

   A virus or any malware can compromise a legitimate node in this 
   network. Then this node can forge the identity of service or perform 
   DoS attack on this network. 


3.5.  Malicious update on unicast DNS 

   A malicious node can spoof the content of DNS update message and add 
   malicious records to unicast DNS. This attack is applicable on 
   enterprise networks. 


3.6.  Cache Poisoning  

   Usually a list of services are cached in the service requester. When 
   a malicious node has a chance to compromise this cache by advertising 
   fake services, then the service requester might always connect to 
   this fake service. This attack is applicable to temporary public 
   hotspot, home, enterprise, Mesh and 6LowPAN networks. 


3.6.1.  mixing unicast names with mDNS names 

   A fake service might poison the cache of a service requester with 
   records that has global unicast name like a well-known website and 
   tries to do phising attacks by forwarding all requests to its desired 
   local server 


3.7.  Privacy Problems 

   If a malicious node is in any subnet (WLAN and WAN) of a network, it 
   can learn about all services available in this network. The DNS-SD

INTERNET DRAFT                     mDNS Threat Model      March 22, 2015

   discloses some critical information about resources in this network 
   which might be harmful to privacy. This attack is applicable to 
   temporary public hotspot and enterprise networks. 


3.7.1.  Storing mDNS names in unicast DNS 

   When a name of a service is stored in unicast DNS Resource Records, 
   in case this unicast DNS is accessible over the internet or over 
   several networks, it might expose the services to unwanted nodes and 
   harms privacy. This is applicable to campus networks, mesh networks, 
   temporary public hotspots and enterprise networks. 


3.8.  Resource spoofing 

   services in the network might advertise their service with similar 
   names for load balancing. A malicious node can claim to be one of the 
   load balanced resource devices and maliciously respond to requests. 
   This is applicable to temporary public hotspot and enterprise 
   networks. 


3.9.  Internationalized label and Rogue service 

   Using Internationalized label might allow an attacker to advertise a 
   fake service with similar looking character as legitimate service. 
   This might lead to the case where user chooses fake advertised 
   service as a legitimate one. 


3.10.  Dual stack attacks 

   Having both IPv4 and IPv6 in the same network and trying to aggregate 
   service discovery traffic on both IP stacks might cause new security 
   flaws during the translation or aggregation of this traffic. It might 
   lead to wide range of spoofing attacks. This attack is applicable to 
   home, enterprise, campus, mesh and temporary public hotspots. 


3.11.  MAC address spoofing 

   In a wireless environment where MAC address filtering is in use to 
   avoid any malicious node joining to the network, a malicious node can 
   easily spoof the MAC address of a legitimate node and join the 
   network and perform DoS attack, forge the identity of a service or 
   any other malicious activities. This attack is applicable to 
   temporary public networks and enterprise networks. 


3.12.  Privacy Protection Mechanisms

INTERNET DRAFT                     mDNS Threat Model      March 22, 2015

3.12.1.  The Use of Random Data 

   Using a random name for services or devices or the use of random 
   numbers wherever possible, might prevent exposing the exact model or 
   exact information regarding the DNS-SD service providers (e.g. 
   printers, etc.) in the network to the attackers. However, this 
   approach cannot be used for some standard information that the 
   protocol needs to carry in order to offer service to other nodes. 
   Otherwise, this random information was exchanged and agreed on 
   between service providers and service requesters beforehand. This is 
   exactly against the nature of zero conf protocols, i.e., DNS-SD 


3.12.2.  Data Encryption 

   Encrypting the whole DNS-SD message is another way to hide the 
   critical information in the network. But this approach might not fit 
   well to the nature of this protocol. The reason is because these 
   devices usually respond to anonymous service discovery requests. So, 
   the attacker can also submit and request the same information. In 
   other words, encryption in this stage is only extra efforts without 
   having any benefit from it. 


3.13.  Security Protection Mechanisms 


3.13.1.  Unicast DNS protection mechanisms 


3.13.1.1.  DNSSEC 

   DNSSEC can be used to allow any services to update its records on 
   unicast DNS that supports DNSSEC. However, it is not a zero 
   configuration mechanism and need the introduction of the DNSSEC key 
   to a service or availability of a trust model. Furthermore, this 
   mechanism does not provide data confidentiality. 


3.13.1.2.  CGA-TSIG 

   CGA-TSIG [cga-tsig] is another possible solution that can provide the 
   node with secure authentication, data integrity and data 
   confidentiality. It provides the node with zero or minimal 
   configuration when it is integrated with SAVI-DHCP or secure RA 
   message [RFC7113]. This is useful when the node needs to update any 
   record on an unicast DNS or there is an access list on services. This 
   approach can be used to authenticate and authorize a node to use a 
   service or a device. 


3.13.1.3.  DNS over DTLS

INTERNET DRAFT                     mDNS Threat Model      March 22, 2015


3.13.2.  Authorization of a Service Requester 


3.13.2.1.  The Use of an Access List 

   There can be an access list on each service with the list of IP 
   addresses that can use these services. Then the service can use 
   mechanisms to authorize the service requester or to securely 
   authenticate them with minimum interaction (zero configuration). This 
   approach prevents the service from unauthorized use by an attacker. 
   There are currently some mechanisms available -- SAVI-DHCP, CGA-TSIG, 
   etc. 


3.13.2.2.  SAVI-DHCP 

   SAVI-DHCP [DHCP-SAVI] approach uses a simple mechanism in switches or 
   devices that knows information about the ports of switches to filter 
   any malicious traffic. This mitigates attacks on DHCP server spoofing 
   and can make sure that nobody can spoof the IP address of the service 
   providers. 


3.13.2.3.  The Use of Shared Secret 

   A shared secret (e.g. a password) can be shared among the service 
   requesters. Then this value can be used to access the services and 
   authenticated to them. However, this approach has a disadvantage. 
   This is because when one of the nodes in this network that carries 
   this shared secret is compromised then the attacker can also have 
   unauthorized access to these services. Sharing and re-sharing this 
   shared secret does not fit to the zero conf nature of DNS-SD 
   protocol. 


3.13.3.  Authorization of a Service  

   It is really important for the service requesters to ensure that the 
   one claim to be a service (e.g. a printer) is really a service and 
   its identity has not been forged by the attacker. The service 
   requester needs to receive the IP address of services in a secure 
   manner. There are some approaches that can be used for this purpose 
   such as SAVI-DHCP, Router Advertisement. There are also some 
   mechanisms that can be used in service requesters to complete this 
   authentication and authorization processes such as CGA-TSIG, DNS over 
   TLS 


3.13.3.1.  SAVI-DHCP  

   The DHCP server can carry this information and send it to the service 
   requesters at the same time as the service requesters receive a new

INTERNET DRAFT                     mDNS Threat Model      March 22, 2015

   IP address from the DHCP servers. 


3.13.3.2.  Router advertisement 

   If Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) [RFC4861] or Secure Neighbor 
   Discovery (SeND) [RFC3971] are in use, then an option can be added to 
   a router advertisement message which carries required information 
   regarding the IP addresses of services. This is especially secure 
   when SeND is in use. There can be also other protection mechanisms 
   that is explained in [RFC7113]. 


3.13.4.  ULA and GUA Considerations 

   As explained earlier, a ULA prefix is not to be advertised outside 
   the network domain. Administrators need to clearly set the scope of 
   the ULAs and configure ACLs on relevant border routers to enforce 
   this scope. If internal DNS is used, administrators should use 
   internal-only DNS names for ULAs and perhaps use split horizon DNS to 
   ensure internal names do not resolve on the Internet as described in 
   RFC6950. 


3.13.4.1.  mDNS proxy and Security consideration 

   Unlike IPv4, there can be multiple IP address assignments per 
   interface. For example, a printer might return both GUA and ULA 
   addresses. From a security standpoint, it becomes essential only ULAs 
   be published in DNS-SD populated by mDNS. 


3.13.5.  Other Security Considerations 

   Since a WLAN might also cover a part of city, it is really important 
   to make sure that there is required filtering in edge networks to 
   avoid distribution of mDNS/DNS-SD messages beyond the enterprise 
   networks. 


3.14.  Not Usable Security Mechanisms  

   There are some other security mechanisms that are not fit to DNS-SD 
   protocol but might be useable in future. 


3.14.1.  IPsec 

   IPsec is a security protection mechanism. It requires manual step for 
   the configuration of the nodes. However, recently there are some new 
   drafts to automate this process. This is, of course, might not be an 
   ideal solution for DNS-SD. It is because it might not fit to nodes 
   with limited resources (e.g. battery). Data encryption, as explained

   in section 3.12.2. is not suitable for DNS-SD. 

4.  Security Considerations

   This document documents the security of mDNS and DNS-SD. It does not 
   introduce any additional security considerations 



5.  IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA consideration
