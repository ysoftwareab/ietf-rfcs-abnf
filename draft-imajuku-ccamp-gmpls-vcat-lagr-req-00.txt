1. Introduction

   The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane
   has been expected to unify the control scheme of networks with
   multiple switching capabilities and achieve fast provisioning and
   dynamic control of Label Switched Paths (LSPs). Dynamic LSP control
   includes not only protection and restoration, but also capacity 
   control of the LSPs. As for the capacity control of the LSPs, fast
   control of the LSP capacity can enhance the degree of resiliency 
   against unexpected traffic surges, which can be caused by a Label 
   Switch Router (LSR) failure and so on, and enhance the capacity 
   control of a higher order LSP such as the SDH/SONET from a lower-
   order LSP such as the Ethernet LSP. 

   The combined usage of virtual concatenation (VCAT) [ITU-T G.707-SDH],
   [ITU-T G.707-SONET] and the link capacity adjustment scheme (LCAS)
   [ITU-T G.7042] provides dynamic capacity control of the LSP in the
   SDH/SONET network. The LCAS achieves hitless bandwidth modification
   via signaling in the H4 byte of the SDH/SONET link (Here, "hitless"
   means no packet loss). Analogous to the VCAT & LCAS in the SDH/SONET
   link, link aggregation (LAGR) and the link aggregation control
   protocol (LACP) [IEEE 802.3ad] can be applied to the capacity
   control of LSPs. Although the capacity for each packet flow cannot
   exceed the capacity of the component links, by using LAGR the total
   capacity of the LSP can exceed the limit of the interface speed. 

   Typically, network management systems (NMSs) are required to manage
   the physical structure, i.e. bay, shelf, and slot, of each network

   element (NE) to set the VCAT group or the LAGR group at each LSP
   termination point. The VCAT and LAGR technologies require manual
   setting to form the group LSP at both LSP termination points. This
   can be an obstacle in achieving autonomous control of the LSP
   capacity. 

   This document describes the requirements for GMPLS support of VCAT &
   LCAS and LAGR & LACP control. First, this document clarifies the
   problems in applying GMPLS to the VCAT & LCAS and LAGR & LACP
   control. Then, this document describes the GMPLS extension
   requirements and considers the VCAT group and the LAGR group as 
   forwarding adjacency (FA). The following abbreviations are used in
   this document:

   FA: Forwarding Adjacency
   GFP: Generic Framing Procedure
   GMPLS: Generalized Multi-Protocol Switching
   LACP: Link Aggregation Control Protocol
   LAGR: Link Aggregation
   LCAS: Link Capacity Adjustment Scheme

2. Need for VCAT & LCAS and LAGR & LACP Control Support in GMPLS

   This section describes the need for GMPLS functionality to control
   VCAT & LCAS and LAGR & LACP. Figure 1 shows the assumed GMPLS
   network comprising the SDH/SONET switch capable nodes achieving
   STS-3n/VC-n LSP cross-connection and packet switch capable (PSC) 
   nodes. The links amongst SDH/SONET nodes are SDH/SONET links.
   All of the PSC nodes are accommodated by the SDH/SONET nodes via
   multiple Ethernet links.

   The SDH/SONET nodes of T1, T3, and T4 in the SDH/SONET region have  
   the Generic Framing Procedure (GFP), VCAT, and LCAS capabilities. In
   other words, these nodes cannot only terminate multiple component
   VC-n LSPs to form a VC-n LSP group, i.e., virtually concatenated
   VC-n-xv LSP, with the VCAT functionality, but also "hitlessly"
   change the component VC-n LSPs in the VC-n LSP group with the LCAS
   functionality. Therefore, these nodes can provide a "flexible
   bandwidth" to their clients.

   The PSC nodes P1, P2, and P3 have the LAGR and LACP capabilities.
   Therefore, P1, P2, and P3 can establish an Ether-LSP with multi
   -link capacity. When the PSC nodes establish the LAGR group LSPs,
   the PSC nodes start to exchange LACP packets in the LSP. In this
   document, we call this LSP the LAGR group LSP. Although the capacity
   for each packet flow cannot exceed the capacity of the component
   LSPs, by using LAGR the total capacity of the LAGR group LSP can
   exceed the limit of the interface speed.

   2.1 Need for VCAT & LCAS control

   The creation and deletion of virtually concatenated LSPs such as 
   VC-n-xv LSP are achieved under GMPLS control. GMPLS signaling can
   perform not only direct creation and deletion of a VC-n-xv LSP, but
   also the step-by-step creation and deletion of its component VC-n
   LSP to form the VC-n-xv LSP.

   The route of the component VC-n LSPs of the VC-n-xv LSP may be unique
   or node diverse. For example, the LSP group, i.e. the VC-4-7v LSP,
   between T1 and T4 may comprise seven component VC-4 LSPs with the
   route of T1, T2, and T4. In this case, the "bandwidth modification"
   of the VC-4-xv LSP may be achieved by modifying SUKLM LABEL and
   SDH/SONET SENDER TSPEC [RFC 3946] of the VC-4-xc LSP. Alternatively,
   the VC-4-7v LSP may comprise four component VC-4 LSPs with the route
   of T1, T2, and T4, and three component VC-4 LSPs with the route of
   T1, T3, and T4. The SDH/SONET nodes with the VCAT functionality
   absorb the differential delay amongst the component VC-4 LSPs. In
   this case, the "bandwidth modification" of the LSP group, i.e. the
   VC-4-7v LSP, is achieved by the "connection association
   modification" of the component VC-4 LSPs. The GMPLS signaling should
   include the group ID information clarifying to which VC-4-7v LSP the
   component VC-4 LSP belongs.


Imajuku, Tsukishima and Kim    Expires - January 2006                  4

draft-imajuku-ccamp-gmpls-vcat&lagr-req-00.txt                 June 2005  

   The LCAS signaling is utilized to reconfigure the VC-n-xv LSP without
   the loss of the client signal. The control packets of the LCAS
   signaling are proactively sent to inform the receiver of the changes
   in status at the transmitter using the H4 bite of the SDH/SONET
   superframe and to achieve dynamic reconfiguration of the LSP group.
   The control of the LCAS signaling is uni-directional. Therefore,
   both termination nodes of the VC-n-xv LSP should initiate the LCAS
   signaling by inter-working with the GMPLS signaling [GMPLS-LCAS].

   The GMPLS signaling should be interoperable with LCAS signaling for
   both the "bandwidth modification" and the "connection association
   modification" cases. The success or failure of the LCAS signaling to
   add or delete the VC-n bandwidth should be reflected on the GMPLS
   control plane. This is especially important considering the "make-
   before-break" procedure [RFC3209]. Consider the case of "bandwidth
   modification" by creating a new session of the VC-n-xv LSP, the
   ingress node should recognize whether all of the component VC-n LSPs
   are successfully reconfigured to form a new VC-n-xv LSP. The ingress
   node should initiate a "break" with the old signaling session after
   that recognition.

   2.2 The necessity of the LAGR&LACP control

   The creation and deletion of the LAGR group LSP such as a multi-
   gigabit Ether LSP can be achieved under GMPLS control. GMPLS
   signaling can perform not only direct creation and deletion of the
   LAGR group LSP, but also the step-by-step creation and deletion of
   its component Ether LSPs to form the LAGR group LSP. 

   GMPLS signaling controls the "aggregators" at both LSP termination
   points. The aggregators collect or distribute packets amongst
   component LSPs so as to act as a single LSP for the client.

   The LACP is utilized in the component LSPs in order to synchronize
   the status of the "aggregator" at both LSP termination points.
   Different from the LCAS signaling, LACP does not have the remote
   control capability of a peer interface. The LACP simply provides
   notifies the aggregator of the group ID information for the
   component LSPs and other status information, which helps it to
   determine whether or not to attach or detach component LSPs. GMPLS
   signaling should include the group ID information to clarify to
   which LAGR group LSP the component LSP belongs.

   2.3 Need for VCAT&LCAS and LAGR&LACP control in hierarchical case

   In a hierarchical network, the creation and deletion of the VC-n-xv
   LSP between T1 and T4 may be initiated by the creation of an Ether
   LSP between P1 and P4 with inter-domain TE signaling [INTER-DOMAIN-
   RSVP-TE]. In such a case, "bandwidth modification" and "connection

   association modification" of the VC-n-xv LSP between T1 and T4 may
   be initiated by the signaling of the Ether LSP. The failure of the
   LCAS signaling between T1 and T4 should result in the issuing of an
   error notification from T1 to P1.


3. Problem Statement

   3.1 Problem statement in routing aspect

   One of the advantageous features of VCAT focuses on the
   upgradeability from non-VCAT&LCAS nodes or networks. As shown in
   Fig.1, T2 only provides the switching and termination capabilities
   of VC-n LSP. In such a case, T1, T3, and T4 should confirm the VCAT
   & LCAS capability when calculating the route and termination points
   of the VC-n-xv LSPs. Therefore, each TDM node should advertise its
   VCAT and LCAS capabilities.

   Analogous to the VCAT & LCAS case, the PSC nodes should advertise
   the LAGR capability, if they want to discrimate the LAGR capability. 

   3.2 Problem statement in signaling aspect

   The LCAS signaling in the SDH/SONET data-plane is used for grouping
   uni-directional virtual containers. Therefore, both the ingress and
   egress nodes of the VC-n-xv LSP should initiate LCAS signaling as
   described in the previous section. In order for the egress node to
   set appropriately the component VC-n LSPs to form the VC-n-xv LSP,
   GMPLS signaling should provide the capability to signal the group ID
   for each component VC-n LSP.

   The above problem statement can be commonly applied to the control of
   the LAGR group LSPs. GMPLS signaling of component LSPs should include
   the group ID in order for the egress PSC nodes to set the LAGR group
   among Ethernet interfaces.

   Also, the LCAS signaling in an upstream path of VC-n-xv LSP is
   launched from the egress node. Therefore, the ingress node should
   have the capability to control LCAS signaling of the bandwidth
   modification or connection association modification from the egress
   node. The explicit control and the confirmation of success in LCAS
   signaling enhance the reliability of the "make-before-break"
   procedure. In particular, the tearing down of the component VC-n
   LSPs from the VC-n-xv LSP should be initiated after confirming
   successful decomposition of the component VC-n LSPs.


4. Requirements for GMPLS Extension

   The following extensions for the VCAT & LCAS and the LAGR & LACP 
   support are introduced in this document.

   4.1 Extension for Routing Protocol

 
Imajuku, Tsukishima and Kim    Expires - January 2006                  6

draft-imajuku-ccamp-gmpls-vcat&lagr-req-00.txt                 June 2005 
 
   The ingress node should identify the VCAT, LCAS, or LAGR capability
   of the egress node before the route calculation of the VC-n-xv LSP
   or the LAGR LSP (group LSP). Every node having the VCAT, LCAS, and
   LAGR capabilities are required to advertise the termination
   capability considering a mixed environment of non-VCAT and LCAS
   capable SDH/SONET nodes or non-LAGR PSC nodes. The VCAT and LCAS
   capable SDH/SONET nodes are required to advertise the interface
   switching capability descriptor [GMPLS-ROUTING] indicating VCAT
   capable TDM or VCAT & LCAS capable TDM. Similarly, the LAGR
   capable PSC nodes are required to advertise the interface switching
   capability descriptor indicating LAGR capable PSC.

   4.2 Extension for Signaling Protocol 

   4.2.1 Support for Group ID

   The ingress node should include the group ID in the signaling of each
   component LSP intending to participate in a certain group LSP. The
   concepts of grouping and associating connections have been discussed
   in relation to automatically switched optical network (ASON) support
   [ASON-REQ] or protection and restoration support [E2E-RESTORATION],
   respectively. Therefore, support for the group ID may not require a
   new extension for signaling protocols rather the extension of
   existing protocols.

   This version of the document does not specify which objects should be
   in use. However, the following notes should be taken into
   consideration.

   Note1: ASON requires call and connection separation. The Call ID, the
    long format Call ID specified in [RFC3474] and short format Call ID
    proposed in [ASON-RSVP-TE], can be used as the group ID of the group
    LSP. The short format Call ID requires an extension in the SESSION
    Object. Therefore, the usage of the short format Call ID should be
    static. In other words, connection association modification cannot
    be achieved by simply modifying the short format Call ID. The
    connection association modification using the short format Call ID
    shall be on the "make-before-break" basis only.

   Note 2: Protection and restoration require that the ASSOCIATION
    object be associated with working and back-up connections. In
    addition, n back-up connections are associated to one working
    connection. For the VCAT & LCAS or the LAGR & LACP control, all of
    the n connections should be associated to one virtual connection,
    i.e. the group ID.

   4.2.2 Support for Explicit Control of LCAS Signaling
 
 
Imajuku, Tsukishima and Kim    Expires - January 2006                  7

draft-imajuku-ccamp-gmpls-vcat&lagr-req-00.txt                 June 2005  
 
   The ingress nodes should include L bits in the SDH/SONET SENDER 
   TSPEC object to initiate the LCAS signaling of the upstream path 
   from the egress node. In addition, the egress node should include 
   L bits in the SDH/SONET FLOWSPEC object as a successful response.


5. FA Considerations 

   This section considers the case in which the group LSP is used for FA
   in the network.

   5.1 Routing aspects

   This section considers the case in which the group LSP is used for FA
   in the network. The guideline for advertising the traffic
   engineering extension of the FA-LSP is described in [HIERARCHY]. In
   addition, the case in which FA is induced from the group LSP should
   be considered analogous to link bundling [LINK-BUNDLING].

   (1) Maximum Bandwidth [RFC3630]
   This parameter is not used. The maximum LSP Bandwidth (as described
    below) replaces the Maximum Bandwidth for the FA of the group LSP.

   (2) Maximum LSP Bandwidth [GMPLS-ROUTING]
   The Maximum LSP Bandwidth takes the place of the Maximum Bandwidth.
   The Maximum LSP Bandwidth of the FA at priority p is defined to be
   the maximum of the Maximum LSP Bandwidth at priority p of all
   component LSPs.

   (3) Max Reservable Bandwidth [RFC3630]
   The FA advertisement of the group LSP is configured using the sum of
   the Maximum Reservable Bandwidths of all component LSPs associated
   with the group LSP or the FA advertisement of the group LSP is
   configured with the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth of the component
   LSPs. The case that should be employed may depend on the switching
   capability of the network. However, the FA advertisement of the VC-
   n-xv LSP in the PSC network may be the former case. On the other
   hand, the FA advertisement of the link aggregation LSPs in the PSC
   network may be the latter case. 

   (4) Link Protection Type [GMPLS-ROUTING]
   The link protection type of the FA advertisement for the group LSP
   should be unprotected unless all of the component LSPs are protected.

   (5) Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) [GMPLS-ROUTING]
   SRLG of the FA advertisement for the group LSP should include all of
   the SRLGs of the component LSPs.

   5.2 Signaling aspects

 
Imajuku, Tsukishima and Kim    Expires - January 2006                  8

draft-imajuku-ccamp-gmpls-vcat&lagr-req-00.txt                 June 2005 
 
   If an LSR that originates a group LSP advertises this group LSP as an 
   unnumbered FA, or the LSR uses the FA formed by this LSP as an
   unnumbered component LSP of a group LSP, the LSR MUST allocate an
   identifier to that FA. Moreover, the Path message used for
   establishing the LSP that forms the FA MUST contain the LSP
   TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object as described in [RFC3477].

   Whether or not the component LSP of the group LSP should set the same
   LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID depends on the policy of the LSRs at the
   ingress and egress nodes of the group LSP. Discussion on this policy
   is outside the scope of this document. However, the policy should be
   consistent with the advertisement of the Max Reservable Bandwidth.
   If the Max Reservable Bandwidth is the sum of the Maximum Reservable
   Bandwidths of all component LSPs associated with the group LSP, the
   component LSPs of the group LSP should be set to the same
   LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID. Otherwise, the component LSPs of the group
   LSP should be set to a different LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID.


6. Security consideration

   Security consideration will be discussed in a future version.  This
   requirement will not change the underlying security issues.


7. IANA Considerations 

   This document does not contain any IANA actions.
