1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-rift-rift] introduces the protocol definition of RIFT.
   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure
   and manage the RIFT protocol.  The model is based on YANG 1.1 as
   defined in [RFC7950] and conforms to the Network Management Datastore
   Architecture (NDMA) as described in [RFC8342]

1.1.  Terminology

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in [RFC6020]
   and [RFC7950], including:

   o  augment

   o  container

   o  choice

   o  data model

   o  data node

   o  grouping

   o  identity

   o  leaf

   o  leaf-list

   o  list

   o  module

   o  uses

   The following abbreviations are used in this document and the defined
   model:

   RIFT: Routing in Fat Trees [I-D.ietf-rift-rift].

1.2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Tree Diagrams

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

1.4.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes, actions, and other data model
   objects are often used without a prefix, as long as it is clear from
   the context in which YANG module each name is defined.  Otherwise,
   names are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG module, as shown in Table 1.

2.  Design of the Data Model

2.1.  Scope of Model

   The model covers RIFT [I-D.ietf-rift-rift].

   This model can be used to configure and manage the RIFT protocol.
   The operational state data and statistics can be retrieved by this
   model.  Even though no protocol-specific notifications are defined in
   this model, the subscription and push mechanism defined in [RFC8639]
   and [RFC8641] can be implemented by the user to subscribe to
   notifications on the data nodes in this model.

   The model contains all the basic configuration parameters to operate
   the protocol.  Depending on the implementation choices, some systems
   may not allow some of the advanced parameters to be configurable.
   The occasionally implemented parameters are modeled as optional
   features in this model.  This model can be extended, and it has been
   structured in a way that such extensions can be conveniently made.

2.2.  Specification

   This model imports and augments ietf-routing YANG model defined in
   [RFC8349].  Both configuration branch and state branch of [RFC8349]
   are augmented.  The configuration branch covers node base and policy
   configuration.  The container "rift" is the top level container in
   this data model.  The presence of this container is expected to
   enable RIFT protocol functionality.

Internet-Draft               RIFT YANG Model                   July 2020


   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].  The operational
   state data is combined with the associated configuration data in the
   same hierarchy [RFC8407].

2.3.  Overview

   The RIFT YANG module defined in this document has all the common
   building blocks for the RIFT protocol.

   The RIFT YANG module augments the /routing/control-plane-protocols/
   control-plane-protocol path defined in the ietf-routing module.  The
   ietf-rift model defines a single instance of RIFT.  Multiple
   instances are instantiated as multiple control-plane protocols
   instances.

2.4.  RIFT configuration

   The configuration data nodes cover node configuration attributes.
   RIFT configurations require node base information configurations.
   Some features can be used to enhance protocol, such as BFD, flooding-
   reducing, community attribute.

2.5.  RIFT State

   The state data nodes include node, neighbor, database and kv-store
   information.

2.6.  Notifications

   Unexpected TIE and neighbor's layer error should be notified.

4.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  Writable data node represent
   configuration of each instance, node, interface, etc.  These
   correspond to the following schema nodes:

   o  /rift

   o  /rift/node/

Internet-Draft               RIFT YANG Model                   July 2020


   Modifying the configuration may cause all the RIFT neighborship to be
   rebuilt.  For example, the configuration changing of level or
   systemid, will lead to all the neighbor connections of this node
   rebuilt.  The incorrect modification of authentication, except for
   the neighbor connection broken, will lead to the permanent connection
   broken.  The modification of interface, will lead to the neighbor
   state changing.  In general, unauthorized modification of most RIFT
   configurations will pose there own set of security risks and the
   "Security Considerations" in the respective reference RFCs should be
   consulted.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /rift

   o  /rift/interface

   o  /rift/database

   o  /rift/kv-store

   The exposure of the database will expose the detailed topology of the
   network.  Network operators may consider their topologies to be
   sensitive confidential data.

   For RIFT authentication, configuration is supported via the
   specification of key-chains [RFC8177] or the direct specification of
   key and authentication algorithm.  Hence, authentication
   configuration inherits the security considerations of [RFC8177].
   This includes the considerations with respect to the local storage
   and handling of authentication keys.

   number (and remove this note).

   This document registers a URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registration is
   requested to be made:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-rift

   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document also requests one new YANG module name in the YANG
   Module Names registry [RFC6020] with the following suggestion:
