1.  Introduction

   [RFC8283]introduces the architecture for PCE as a central controller
   as an extension of the architecture described in [RFC4655] and
   assumes the continued use of PCEP as the protocol used between PCE
   and PCC.  [RFC8283]further examines the motivations and applicability
   for PCEP as a Southbound Interface (SBI), and introduces the
   implications for the protocol.

Internet-Draft                 PCECC BIER                     March 2022


   [RFC9050] specify the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions for
   using the PCE as the central controller for static LSPs, where LSPs
   can be provisioned as explicit label instructions at each hop on the
   end-to-end path.  Each router along the path must be told what label-
   forwarding instructions to program and what resources to reserve.
   The PCE-based controller keeps a view of the network and determines
   the paths of the end-to-end LSPs, and the controller uses PCEP to
   communicate with each router along the path of the end-to-end LSP.

   [RFC8279] defines a Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)
   architecture where all intended multicast receivers are encoded as a
   bitmask in the multicast packet header within different
   encapsulations such as described in [RFC8296].  A router that
   receives such a packet will forward the packet based on the bit
   position in the packet header towards the receiver(s) following a
   precomputed tree for each of the bits in the packet.  Each receiver
   is represented by a unique bit in the bitmask.

   In order to reduce the transmission of redundant information, the
   PCE-based controllers do not allocate the BFIT directly.  Instead,
   the PCC generates the BFIT based on the received bier informations or
   the node calculates the nexthop by itself.  This document specifies
   the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions when a PCE-based
   controller is also responsible for configuring the BIER informations.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  PCECC BIER Requirements

   Following key requirements for PCECC-BIER should be considered
   when`designing the PCECC based solution:

   *  PCEP speaker supporting this draft needs to have the capability to
      advertise its PCECC-BIER capability to its peers.

   *  PCEP speaker not supporting this draft needs to be able to reject
      PCECC-BIER related message with a reason code that indicates no
      support for PCECC.

   *  PCEP procedures needs to provide a means to update (or cleanup)
      the BIER related informations (BIER subdomain-id, BFR-id and BSL
      etc) to the PCC.

Internet-Draft                 PCECC BIER                     March 2022


   *  PCEP procedures needs to provide a means to update (or cleanup)
      the "Bit Index Forwarding Table"(BIFT) to the PCC.

   *  PCEP procedures needs to provide a means to synchronize the BIER
      related informations (BIER subdomain-id, BFR-id and BSL etc)
      between PCE to PCC in the PCEP messages.

3.  Procedures for Using the PCE as the Central Controller (PCECC) in
    BIER

   Active stateful PCE is described in [RFC8231].  PCE as a central
   controller (PCECC) reuses existing Active stateful PCE mechanism as
   much as possible to control the LSP.

   This document uses the same PCEP messages and its extensions which
   are described in [RFC9050] for PCECC-BIER as well.

   PCEP messages PCRpt, PCInitiate, PCUpd are also used to send LSP
   Reports, LSP setup and LSP update respectively.  The extended
   PCInitiate message described in [RFC9050] is used to download or
   cleanup central controller's instructions (CCIs) (BIER related
   informations and "Bit Index Forwarding Table"(BIFT) in scope of this
   document).  The extended PCRpt message described in [RFC9050] is also
   used to report the CCIs (BIER related informations) from PCC to PCE.

   [RFC9050] specify an object called CCI for the encoding of central
   controller's instructions.  This document extends the CCI by defining
   another object-type for BIER.

3.1.  PCECC Capability Advertisement

   During PCEP Initialization Phase, PCEP Speakers (PCE or PCC)
   advertise their support of PCECC extensions.  A PCEP Speaker includes
   the "PCECC Capability" sub-TLV, described in [RFC9050].

   This document adds B-bit in PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV for BIER.

3.2.  New BIER Path Setup

   The PCEP messages pertaining to PCECC-BIER MUST include PATH-SETUP-
   TYPE TLV [RFC8408] with PST=TBD in the SRP object to clearly identify
   the PCECC-BIER is intended.

3.3.  PCECC BIER information allocation and Generation of BFIT

   There are two ways to generate a "Bit Index Forwarding Table"(BIFT):

Internet-Draft                 PCECC BIER                     March 2022


   *  The PCECC allocate parameters(BIER subdomain-id, BFR-id, BAR and
      IPA) carried by CCI object, parameters(BFR prefix, BSL,
      Encapsulation Type, BIFT ID, and Max SI) carried by BIER
      Encapsulation TLV and parameters (BFR prefix)carried by OFEC
      Object to the PCC.  On receiving the BIER informations allocation,
      each node (PCC) uses IGP protocol to distribute BIER related
      information to other nodes.  The node calculate the nexthop.  In
      this case, Each node (PCC) only needs to be allocated its own BIER
      informations by the PCECC.

   *  In scenarios where the IGP protocol is not used/available,Each
      node (PCC) is allocated its own and neighbor BIER informations by
      the PCECC, then PCC generates a BIFT based on the informations it
      receives.  The BIER informations include BIER subdomain-id and
      BFR-id carried by CCI object, BFR prefix, BSL, Encapsulation Type,
      BIFT ID, and Max SI carried by BIER Encapsulation TLV , BFR-NBR
      carried by Address TLV and BFR prefix carried by OFEC Object.  The
      BIFT mainly includes BFR ID, F-BM and BFR nexthop.

3.4.  Redundant PCEs

   [I-D.ietf-pce-state-sync] describes synchronization mechanism between
   the stateful PCEs.  The BIER informations allocated by a PCE MUST
   also be synchronized among PCEs for PCECC BIER state synchronization.

3.5.  Re Delegation and Cleanup

   [RFC9050] describes the action needed for CCIs for the Basic PCECC
   LSP on this terminated session.  Similarly actions should be applied
   for the BIER information as well.

3.6.  Synchronization of BIER information Allocations

   [RFC9050] describes the synchronization of Central Controller's
   Instructions (CCI) via LSP state synchronization as described in
   [RFC8231] and [RFC8232].Same procedures should be applied for BIER
   informations as well.

4.  PCEP extension

4.1.  The OPEN Object

4.1.1.  PCECC Capability sub-TLV

   [RFC9050] defined the PCECC-CAPABILITY TLV.  A new B-bit is defined
   in PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV for PCECC-BIER:

   indicates that the PCEP speaker is capable for PCECC-BIER capability
   and PCE would allocate BIER information on this session.

4.2.  PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV

   The PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV is defined in [RFC8408].  PST = TBD is used
   when Path is setup via PCECC BIER mode.On a PCRpt/PCUpd/PCInitiate
   message, the PST=TBD indicates that this path was setup via a PCECC-
   BIER based mechanism where either the BIER informations and BIER
   forwarding entries were allocated/instructed by PCE via PCECC
   mechanism.

4.3.  CCI object

   The Central Control Instructions (CCI) Object is used by the PCE to
   specify the forwarding instructions is defined in [RFC9050].  This
