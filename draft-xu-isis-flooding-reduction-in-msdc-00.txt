                    IS-IS Flooding Reduction in MSDC
              draft-xu-isis-flooding-reduction-in-msdc-00

Abstract

   IS-IS is commonly used as a underlay routing protocol for MSDC
   (Massively Scalable Data Center) networks.  This document proposes
   some extensions to IS-IS so as to reduce the IS-IS flooding within
   MSDC networks greatly.  The reduction of the IS-IS flooding is much
   beneficial to improve the scalability of MSDC networks.

1.  Introduction

   IS-IS is commonly used as a underlay routing protocol for Massively
   Scalable Data Center (MSDC) networks.  In addition, centrolized
   controllers are becoming fundamental network elements in most MSDCs.
   One or more controllers are usually connected to all routers within
   the MSDC network via a Local Area Network (LAN) which is dedicated
   for network management purpose (called management LAN), as shown in
   Figure 1.

                              Figure 1

   With the assistance of a controller acting as IS-IS Designated
   Intermediate System (DIS) for the management LAN, IS-IS routers
   within the MSDC network don't need to exchange any IS-IS Protocl
   Datagram Units (PDUs) other than Hello packets among them.  In order
   to obtain the full topology information (i.e., the fully synchronized
   link-state database) of the MSDC's network, these IS-IS routers would
   exchange the link-state information with the controller being elected
   as IS-IS DIS for the management LAN instead.

   To further suppress the flooding of multicast IS-IS PDUs originated
   from IS-IS routers over the management LAN, IS-IS routers would not
   send multicast IS-IS Hello packets over the management LAN.
   Insteads, they just wait for IS-IS Hello packets originated from the
   controller being elected as IS-IS DIS initially.  Once an IS-IS DIS
   for the management LAN has been discovered, they start to send IS-IS
   Hello packets directly (as unicasts) to the IS-IS DIS periodically.

   In addition, IS-IS routers would send IS-IS PDUs to the IS-IS DIS for
   the management LAN as unicasts as well.  In contrast, the controller
   being elected as IS-IS DIS would send IS-IS PDUs as before.  As a
   result, IS-IS routers would not receive IS-IS PDUs from one another
   unless these IS-IS PDUs are forwarded as unknown unicasts over the
   management LAN.  Through the above modifications to the current IS-IS
   router behaviors, the IS-IS flooding is greatly reduced which is much
   beneficial to improve the scalability of MSDC networks.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC1195].

3.  Modifications to Current IS-IS Behaviors

3.1.  IS-IS Routers as Non-DIS

   After the bidirectional exchange of IS-IS Hello packets among IS-IS
   routers, IS-IS routers would originate Link State PDUs (LSPs)
   accordingly.  However, these self-originated LSPs need not to be
   exchanged directly among them anymore.  Instead, these LSPs just need
   to be sent solely to the controller being elected as IS-IS DIS for
   the management LAN.

   To further reduce the flood of multicast IS-IS PDUs over the
   management LAN, IS-IS routers SHOULD send IS-IS PDUs as unicasts.
   More specifically, IS-IS routers SHOULD send unicast IS-IS Hello
   packets periodically to the controller being elected as IS-IS DIS.
   In other words, IS-IS routers would not send any IS-IS Hello packet
   over the management LAN until they have found an IS-IS DIS for the
   management LAN.  Note that IS-IS routers SHOULD NOT be elected as IS-
   IS DIS for the management LAN (This is done by setting the DIS
   Priority of those IS-IS routers to zero).  As a result, IS-IS routers
   would not see each other over the management LAN.  In other word, IS-
   IS routers would not establish adjacencies with one other.
   Furthermore, IS-IS routers SHOULD send all the types of IS-IS PDUs to
   the controller being elected as IS-IS DIS as unicasts as well.

   To advoid the data traffic from being forwarded across the management
   LAN, the cost of all IS-IS routers' interfaces to the management LAN
   SHOULD be set to the maximum value.

3.2.  Controllers as DIS

   The controller being elected as IS-IS DIS would send IS-IS PDUs as
   multicasts or unicasts as before.  And it SHOULD accept and process
   those unicast IS-IS PDUs originated from IS-IS routers.  Upon
   receiving any new LSP from a given IS-IS router, the controller being
   elected as DIS MUST flood it immediately to the management LAN for
   two purposes: 1) implicitly acknowledging the receipt of that LSP; 2)
   synchronizing that LSP to all the other IS-IS routers.

   Futhermore, to decrease the frequency of advertising Complete
   Sequence Number PDU (CSNP) on the controller being elected as DIS,
   it's RECOMMENDED that IS-IS routers SHOULD send an explicit
   acknowledgement with a Partial Sequence Number PDU (PSNP) upon
   receiving a new LSP from the controller being elected as DIS.
