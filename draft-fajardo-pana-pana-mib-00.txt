1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Overview

   The PANA Base Protocol [RFC5191] is structured for network access
   authentication where authenticating peers are typically in a many-to-
   one relationship; multiple end-users (PaC) and an authentication
   server (PAA).  Therefore the PANA protocols operating parameters
   naturally segments to parameters that are common to both PaC and PAA
   and parameters specific only to either PaC and PAA.

   The MIB objects described in this document follows the same pattern.
   As of this writing, there are not explicit dependecies between this
   document and other MIB modules.
