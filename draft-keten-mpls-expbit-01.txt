Abstract

   This document specifies the new label/header architecture for a new
   Multiprotocol Label Switching and proposes a new Label Standard.
   With this new architecture the aim is to provide more QoS options.

1. Introduction

         This internet draft outlines a proposed change for the MPLS
         architecture as defined in RFC 3031 and the MPLS Label Stack
         Encoding RFC 3032 to suit the need of differentiated services
         and their requirements for more differentiated QoS.

         Current services require more specific QoS parameters then the
         8 possibilities provided by the 3 bit in the EXP/COS/TC field.

         3 bits is not enough to differentiate in our current service
         oriented environment.

         With this Proposed Standard a possibility of 32 QoS settings
         can be achieved.









2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying significance described in RFC 2119.

   In this document, the characters ">>" preceding an indented line(s)
   indicates a statement using the key words listed above. This
   convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying or finding the
   portions of this RFC covered by these keywords.

3. Overview and Current Encoding of the Label Stack

      The current label stack as described in RFC 3032 is represented
      as a sequence of "label stack entries".
      Each label stack entry is represented by 4 octets.

      This is shown in Figure 1:

   Octets  0             1              2             3              4

   Bits   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

   Label   -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
   Stack  |             Label               |  EXP   |S|      TTL     |
   Entry   -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

     Figure 1

      Label:       Label Value, 20 bit
      EXP/TC/COS:  3 bits defined as TC, RFC 5462
      S:           Bottom of Stack, 1 bit
      TTL:         Time to Live, 8 bits

4. New Proposed Encoding of the Label Stack

      The New label stack described is represented as the same sequence
      of "label stack entries" as in RFC 3032. However the assigned 8
      bits to TTL have been deducted by 2, to a total of 6 bits and
      added to the EXP/TC/COS stack which will now be a 5 bits entry.

     This is shown in Figure 2.



  Octets 0             1              2             3              4
  Bits  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

   Label   -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
   Stack  |             Label               |    EXP    |S|    TTL    |
   Entry   -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

     Figure 2

      Label:       Label Value, 20 bit
      EXP/TC/COS:  5 bits defined in New Proposed Format
      S:           Bottom of Stack, 1 bit
      TTL:         Time to Live, 6 bits

5. More QoS parameters

   With the addition of 2 more bits in the EXP/TC stack, more QoS
   parameters can be set to suit the needs of current IP Internet
   services.

   A TTL value of 255 provided by the 8 bits was never used to the full
   extend and will be never used to this extend, thus moving the 2 bits
   to the EXP field which is used for QoS will create a richer service
   deployment environment.


6. Backwards Compatability

   As the length of the fields are changed in the header, backwards 
   compatability will not be possible. 
   

7. Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [RFC2234].



8. Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations.



9. IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.



10. Conclusions

   With this document a necessary and easy change is advised. More
   diverse QoS settings will enable a more service oriented network.
