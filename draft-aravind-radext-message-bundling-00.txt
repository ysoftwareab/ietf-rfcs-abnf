Abstract

   This draft proposes a mechanism to bundle multiple RADIUS requests in
   a single RADIUS Message which could assist in improving the overall
   performance and scalability.

1  Introduction

   Currently, RADIUS Messages that are exchanged between the Network
   Access Server/Authenticator and RADIUS Server (Authentication Server)
   allows only one RADIUS request per message. When there are a large
   number of RADIUS requests to be sent from the Authenticator, then it
   can affect its performance as separate RADIUS message needs to be
   sent for each request. 

   Typically implementation specific reliability mechanism is required
   to ensure message delivery for each RADIUS message. This may be
   costlier with respect to performance if multiple RADIUS requests need
   to be sent at the same time. Scalability is also affected by the
   performance bottlenecks of current RADIUS limitation. The above
   mentioned problem is very significant in the deployment scenarios of
   802.1x supplicants where thousands of supplicants need to be
   authenticated at the same time. This can happen in the events such as
   NAS restart or the port flaps to which the supplicants are connected.
   


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2  Solution

   In the single RADIUS Message, accommodate multiple RADIUS requests
   instead of just one request. Each request would contain its own set
   of Code, Packet Identifier, Length, Authenticator and Attribute Value
   Pairs fields. No new message types or TLVs are introduced and hence
   server can support this proposal with minimal changes. According to
   RFC 2865 [RFC2865] that details the RADIUS protocol, the maximum
   message size is 4096 bytes. Hence, we can piggyback the requests up
   to this maximum length. 

   One bundling mechanism could be that we can have a timeout T in
   milli-seconds to pack multiple requests and send out the RADIUS
   message. Trigger for sending the RADIUS message can be either the
   maximum message length or timeout T.


   RADIUS Message
   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----+
   | Request-1 | Request-2 | Request-3 | ... |
   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----+

   Contents of each Request in RADIUS Message
   +------+-----------+--------+---------------+------+
   | Code | Packet ID | Length | Authenticator | AVPs | 
   +------+-----------+--------+---------------+------+

   All the existing RADIUS Codes, Attributes and Specifications can be
   used without any modifications. 


3  Implementation Considerations

   This bundling mechanism is applicable to the RADIUS Messages sent to
   and from the RADIUS Server. 

   The current RADIUS Server implementations expect only a single
   request in a RADIUS message. Hence, before using this mechanism, the
   implementation on the other side MUST be upgraded to support this
   bundling mechanism. Hence, the Client/Network Access Server MUST use
   this mechanism only after upgrading the RADIUS Server implementation
   and vice versa from the RADIUS Server to the Client/Network Access
   Server.
