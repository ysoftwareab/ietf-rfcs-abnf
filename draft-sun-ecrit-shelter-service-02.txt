Abstract

   This document defines and registers a new service 'shelter', for the
   service URN to find, what instances of shelter service are closest to
   the user's location.  The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST)
   protocol can provide these information for a geographical region.

Internet-Draft               Shelter Service                   July 2009


1.  Introduction

   It happens to announce shelter areas or locations before or after
   nature disasters occur.  A hill area could be declared as a shelter
   area for being safe from a flood threat.  LoST client can find out
   what instances of this service are closest to users.  Examples
   include earthquake shelter, flood shelter, air-raid shelter, wildfire
   etc.

   To prepare for or to respond to natural and man-made disasters, the
   public needs access to information about emergency shelters.
   Different types of emergencies call for different types of shelters.
   For example, residents should flee to an elevated building for a
   flood, but to an underground area for a hurricane.  To locate
   appropriate near-by shelters, we can use the location-to-service
   translation protocol (LoST) [RFC5222], using a set of service URNs
   defined in this document.


2.  Terminology used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Sub-Services for the 'shelter' service

   This section defines the shelter service using the top-level service
   label 'shelter'.

           urn:service:shelter
           urn:service:shelter.airraid
           urn:service:shelter.earthquake
           urn:service:shelter.flood
           urn:service:shelter.heatwave
           urn:service:shelter.homeless
           urn:service:shelter.hurricane
           urn:service:shelter.wildfire


4.  Example for finding shelters

   In this example, we use the circular shape in queries and
   serviceLocation element in responses introduced by [LOST-EXT].  The
   <serviceLocation> element contains the geodetic coordinates of a
   point of service and must be contained in a <mapping> element.  In
   responses such as <findServiceResponse>, a list of service URIs, each

   with its own <serviceLocation> element, must be returned.

              Figure 1: A <findService> query


   The client is asking the LoST server to send URIs and other
   information of earthquake shelter places within 2000.24 meters from
   its approximate position specified in <p2:pos>.

   In response to the query the LoST server says that the given shelters
   specified by these service locations are safe area from earth quake.
   In the same way he can request for other shelter services.


5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC5031] and [RFC5222] are relevant
   to this document.


6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Sub-Services for the 'shelter' Service

   This section defines the service registration within the IANA
   registry, using the top-level service label 'shelter'.



    urn:service:shelter 'shelter' service denotes a top-level service,
        and it encompasses all of the services listed below.

    urn:service:shelter.airraid This service identifier is used to find
        a safe place from the air-raid. (example: bunker)

    urn:service:shelter.earthquake A safe place from the earthquake
        can be found by using this identifier (example: tent)

    urn:service:shelter.flood Sub-service is used to identify
        shelters from the flood disaster (example: a hill)

    urn:service:shelter.heatwave Heat wave shelters are identified by
        using this identifier (example: cool places can be
        a shelter from heat wave)

    urn:service:shelter.homeless This service identifier can be used
        by homeless people to find shelters (example: Usually located in
        urban neighborhoods)

    urn:service:shelter.wildfire Wild fire shelters can be located by
        using this sub-service (example: safety device carried by
        wildland firefighter)

    urn:service:shelter.hurricane This service identifier is used to
        search for safe places from the hurricane (example: storm rooms)
