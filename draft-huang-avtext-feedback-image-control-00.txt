INTERNET DRAFT       <RTCP Feedback Image Control>          July 6, 2015


1  Introduction

   4K Ultra HD technology is by itself a very new trend in the overall
   electronics landscape, and the impact of it is growing month by
   month. The new resolution format itself is slowly starting to remake
   perceptions of where the entire visual media industry will be going
   over the next few years. 

   However, there are not many 4K display devices out yet, and 99.9% of
   all final visual media productions are only 1080p HD. And sometimes
   due to the bandwidth limitation, application providers are unable to
   provide real 4K services to end users. 

   This document introduces a method to let receivers control the part
   of the full video image that they wish to watch. It specifies an
   extension to the messages defined in the Audio-Visual Profile with
   Feedback (AVPF), and it can be applied to any RTP video
   applications.

2  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Motivation

   This document considers following use cases:

      1. In a real-time monitoring application, the user who watches the
      monitor screen may want to get a closer view of some detail of the
      video image. He will want an option to ask for a specific part of
      the full picture allowing the sender to either zoom in to this
      part or send part of the full picture (may be a 4K resolution) to
      reduce the used bandwidth.

      2. In a video conferencing scenario, one user may prefer a
      detailed image of one specific person, e.g., the facial expression
      of the person, while another user may be fine with the initial
      image.

   Changing the image can be also done by delivering the original
   encoder image resolution to the receivers and changing it locally, or
   by the remote side using camera zoom function. However, that's not
   always feasible for all cases.  In a UHD environment, the issue of
   bandwidth manifests itself in all of the same processes that are in
   effect for those files in 1080p resolution. Even after the 4K streams
 


<R. Huang, et al>       Expires January 7, 2016                 [Page 3]

INTERNET DRAFT       <RTCP Feedback Image Control>          July 6, 2015


   have been optimized at the source, they'll still require at least two
   to three times the bandwidth you'd need today to watch a 1080p HD
   feed. And in case 2, it's also not feasible to use camera zoom
   because not all the receivers want to enlarge their pictures. 

   In this document, a new mechanism is introduced which allows
   applications to signal to the remote encoder the desired image area
   based on the original one. It is useful for cases where higher
   definition resolution is available at the source while only streaming
   of lower definition resolution is supported due to the issues of
   bandwidth or user presenting devices limitation.

   The basic idea is to use a new feedback message to signal the area
   that the receiver requests to enlarge. The specific area is a
   rectangle indicated by the coordinate of the upper left point and the
   length and the width. The unit of the coordinate is based on the
   original picture sent by the sender. It can be illustrated in the
   following figure 1.

       2160      @(x,y) is the start point (upper left point)
         |                         
         |         
         |   x           Length
         |.........@****************
         |         *               *
         |         *               *width
         |       y *               *
         |         *****************
         |         .
         |_________._________________________________3840

   The motivation for using the media path instead of signaling path is
   similar to [RFC5104]. Media and signaling paths are sometimes
   separated in systems employing middle box which has the image control
   ability. As the messages are intended for the media part rather than
   the signaling part, using media path avoid the transmission across
   interfaces and unnecessary control traffic between signaling and
   processing. Moreover, the control handled in media path is faster
   than signaling path as explained in [RFC5104].

4. RTCP Receiver Report Extensions

   The new feedback messages are defined in the following subsections,
   following a similar structure to that in sections 6.3 of the AVPF
   specification [RFC4585].

INTERNET DRAFT       <RTCP Feedback Image Control>          July 6, 2015


4.1. Payload-Specific Feedback Messages

   As specified by Section 6.1 of [RFC4585], Payload-Specific Feedback
   Messages are identified by the RTCP packet type value PSFB (206).

   The following subsections define 2 new FCI formats for the payload-
   specific feedback messages to extend those defined in [RFC4585] and
   [RFC5104].

4.1.1. Image Control Request (ICR)

   The ICR feedback message is identified by RTCP packet type value
   PT=PSFB and FMT=ICR.

   [Note to RFC Editor: Please replace ICR with the IANA provided
   feedback message type for this message.]

   The FCI field MUST contain one ICR FCI entries.

4.1.1.1 Message Format

   The content of the FCI entry for the Image Control Request is showed
   in Figure 2. The length of the feedback message MUST be set to 4.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      |  Seq nr.      |   x axis of start point   |  y axis of start  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | point |          length           |            width          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

          Figure 2: Syntax of an FCI Entry in the ICN Message

   Seq nr.: 8 bits

      Request sequence number. The sequence number space is unique for
      pairing of the SSRC of request source and the SSRC of the request
      target. The sequence number SHALL be increased by 1 modulo 256 for
      new command. The initial value is arbitrary. A repetition message
      SHOULD NOT increase the sequence number.

   x axis of start point: 14 bits

      The start point is the upper left point of the rectangle requested
      to be enlarged. X axis of start point is the value of the
      horizontal axis of this point. A value of 16383 indicates the
      point is invalid.

INTERNET DRAFT       <RTCP Feedback Image Control>          July 6, 2015


   y axis of start point: 14 bits

      Y axis of start point is the value of the vertical axis of this
      point. A value of 16383 indicates the point is invalid.

   length: 14 bits

      Length indicates the horizontal side of the rectangle requested to
      be enlarged. A value of 16383 indicates the rectangle is invalid.

   width: 14 bits

      Width indicates the vertical side of the rectangle requested to be
      enlarged. A value of 16383 indicates the rectangle is invalid.

4.1.1.2. Semantics

   A decoder can request a image control by sending a ICR message to an
   encoder. If the encoder has the ability to do such kind of change, it
   SHOULD take into account the received ICR messages. If one of the
   values in the message is not valid, the encoder SHOULD give up the
   attempt of changing and give a notice. The rectangle requested in the
   ICR message may not suit the final presenting of the image quite
   well. In that case, the decoder is allowed to adjust according to the
   final presenting devices.

   Within the common packet header for feedback messages (as defined in
   section 6.1 of [RFC4585]),the "SSRC of packet sender" field indicates
   the source of the request, and the "SSRC of media source" indicates
   the media source required to be applied the change to.

4.1.1.3. Timing Rules

   The timing follows the rules outlined in section 3 of [RFC4585]. This
   request message is not time critical and SHOULD be sent using regular
   RTCP timing. Only if it is known that the user interface requires
   quick feedback, the message MAY be sent with early or immediate
   feedback timing.

4.1.1.4 Handling of Message in Mixers and Translators

   A mixer of media translator that encodes content sent to the session
   participant issuing the ICR SHALL consider the request to determine
   if it can fulfill it. A media translator unable to fulfill the
   request MAY forward the request unchanged towards the media sender.

   None.

4.1.2  Image Control Notification (ICN)

   The ICN feedback message is identified by RTCP packet type value
   PT=PSFB and FMT=ICN.

   [Note to RFC Editor: Please replace ICN with the IANA provided
   feedback message type for this message.]

   The FCI field MUST contain one ICR FCI entries.

4.1.2.1 Message Format

   The content of the FCI entry for the Image Control Notification is
   showed in Figure 3. The length of the feedback message MUST be set to
   3.

          Figure 3: Syntax of an FCI Entry in the ICN Message

   Seq nr.: 8 bits

      The corresponding request sequence number from the ICR that
      resulted in this notification.

   Result (R): 2 bits

      This field indicates the result that the media sender deals with
      the ICR message.

         R=0: the media sender applies the image change successfully.

         R=1: The values of the ICR message are invalid.

         R=2: The media sender does not support the image change.

         R=3: Reserved.

   Reserved: 22 bits

      All bits SHALL be set to 0 by the sender and SHALL be ignored on

      reception.

4.1.2.2 Semantics

   This feedback message is used to acknowledge the reception of a ICR.
   For each ICR received at the media source, a ICN message SHALL be
   sent. The notification message SHALL also be sent in response to ICR
   repetitions received. If the request receiver has received ICR with
   several different sequence numbers from a single requestor, it SHALL
   only respond to the request with the highest (modulo 265) sequence
   number which may be a smaller integer value due to the wrapping of
   the field.

   Within the common packet header for feedback messages (as defined in
   section 6.1 of [RFC4585]),the "SSRC of packet sender" field indicates
   the source of the notification, and the "SSRC of media source"
   indicates the media source applying the change to.

4.1.2.3. Timing Rules

   The timing follows the rules outlined in section 3 of [RFC4585]. This
   request message is not time critical and SHOULD be sent using regular
   RTCP timing.

4.1.1.4 Handling of Message in Mixers and Translators

   A mixer of media translator that acts upon a ICR SHALL send the
   corresponding ICN. In cases where it needs to forward a ICR itself,
   the notification message MAY need to be delayed until the ICRhas been
   responded to.

4.1.1.5 Remarks

   None.
