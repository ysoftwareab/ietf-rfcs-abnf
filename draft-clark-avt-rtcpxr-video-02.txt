1.  Introduction

   This draft defines several new block types to augment those defined
   in RFC3611 for use in Quality of Service reporting for video over IP.  
   The new block types defined in this draft are the IP Video Metrics 
   Report Block, and the IP Video Metrics Configuration Block.


2.  Definitions

   2.1 Local and Remote IP Endpoints

   A report block produced per this draft is normally produced by the
   endpoint of an RTP stream, and relates to the quality of the received
   RTP stream and impairments that may affect the RTP payload. The
   diagram below illustrates the potential end and mid points that may
   be involved in this process.  Within the context of this example, 
   endpoint "C" is the reporting endpoint and the RTCP XR report relates
   to the RTP stream from "B" to "C".  The other points "A", "B" and "D"
   could also be generating RTCP XR reports.


       ----------->    --------RTP---------->   ------------->
   <A>             <B>                       <C>              <D> 
       <-----------    <-------RTP----------- | <-------------
                                              |
                       <------RTCP XR---------|

   With respect to RTCP XR report blocks generated by "C" in relation to
   the RTP stream from "B" to "C".

   (i) The term "External" is used to relate to the network connected to
   the other side of "this" endpoint (i.e. to the connection from "C" to
   "D").

draft-clark-avt-rtcpxr-video-02.txt                        June 2006

   (ii) The Local IP Endpoint is "this" endpoint (i.e. "C")

   (iii) The Remote IP Endpoint is the source for the RTP stream
   terminated at this endpoint, and for which packet/frame related
   metrics apply. (i.e. "B")

   (iv) The Remote External Endpoint is the remote endpoint on the
   "external" side of this endpoint (i.e. "D").

   (v) The endpoint on the external side of the Remote IP Endpoint (i.e.
   "A") does not have a specific term applied to it, however note that
   some metrics may apply to the "A" to "B" connection.

   2.2 Cumulative and Interval Metrics

   Cumulative metrics relate to the entire duration of the call to the
   point at which metrics are determined and reported, and are typically
   used to report call quality.  Cumulative metrics generally result in
   a lower volume of data that may need to be stored, as each report
   supersedes earlier reports.

   Interval metrics relate to the period since the last Interval report. 
   Interval data may be easier to correlate with specific network events
   for which timing is known, and may also be used as a basis for
   threshold crossing alerts.
   Note that interval metrics for the start and end of calls may be
   unreliable due to factors such as irregular interval length and the
   difficulty in knowing when packet transmission started and ended.

   2.3 Bursts and Gaps

   The terms Burst and Gap are used in a manner consistent with that of
   RTCP XR (RFC3611).  A Gap is a period of time between Bursts such
   that any lost or discarded packets or frames are separated by some
   number of "good" packets or frames.  A Burst is a period of time that
   fails the test for a Gap, and hence corresponds to a degraded quality
   period.  The recommended value for Gmin in RFC3611 resulted in a
   Burst being a period of time during which the packet loss/discard
   rate exceeded 5%. As video is generally more sensitive to packet loss
   this report block uses a larger value for Gmin.

   2.4 Numeric formats

   This report block makes use of binary fractions.  The terminology
   used is
   
   S X:Y, where S indicates a signed representation, 
                X the number of bits prior to the decimal place and 
                Y the number of bits after the decimal place.

   Hence 8:8 represents an unsigned number in the range 0.0039 to
   255.996.

   3.7.4 Mean Buffer Size
   The average playout buffer size expressed in multiples of 100
   milliseconds

4. RTCP XR Video Metrics Configuration Block

   This block type provides a flexible means to describe the algorithms
   used for call quality calculation and other data.  This block need 
   only be exchanged occasionally, for example sent once at the start 
   of a call.

4.1 Header

   Implementations MUST send the Header block within each Video Metrics
   Configuration report.

   4.1.1 Block type
   One Video Metrics Configuration block is defined
		
   mmm+9   = Video Metric Configuration Block

   The time interval associated with these report blocks is left to the
   implementation.  Spacing of RTCP reports should be in accordance
   with RFC3550 however the specific timing of RTCP XR Video reports may
   be determined in response to an internally derived alert such as a
   threshold crossing.

   4.1.2 Map field
   An Map field indicates the optional sub-blocks present in this
   report. A 1 indicates that the sub-block is present, and a 0 that
   the block is absent.  If present, the sub-blocks must be in the 
   sequence defined in this document. 
   The bits have the following definitions:

   0 Correlation Tag 
   1 Algorithm Descriptor 1 
   2 Algorithm Descriptor 2  
   3 Algorithm Descriptor 3 
   4 Algorithm Descriptor 4 
   5 Algorithm Descriptor 5 
   6 Algorithm Descriptor 6 
   7 Algorithm Descriptor 7 
   8 Algorithm Descriptor 8 
   9 Vendor Specific Extension
   10-15 Reserved, set to 0

   4.1.3 Block Length
   The block length indicates the length of this report in 32 bit 
   words and includes the header and any extension octets.

   4.1.4 SSRC
   The SSRC of the stream to which this report relates.

4.2 Correlation Tag 

   The Correlation Tag sub-block MAY be present and if present
   MUST be indicated in the map field. This tag facilitates the
   correlation of the high resolution VoIP metrics report blocks 
   with other call-related data, session-related data or endpoint data.

   An example use case is for an endpoint may convey its version of a 
   call identifier or a global call identifier via this tag. A
   flow measurement tool (sniffer) that is not call-aware can then 
   forward the RTCP XR reports along with this correlation tag to 
   network management. Network management can then use this tag to
   correlate this report with other diagnostic information such as
   call detail records.

   The Tag Type indicates the use of the correlation tag. The following
   values are defined:

     0:  IMS Charging Identity (ICID) subfield of the 
         P-Charging-Vector header specified in RFC 3455.

     1:  Globally unique ID as specified in ITU-T H.225.0 
         (Table 20/H.225.0).

     2:  Conference Identifier, per ITU-T H.225.0 
         (Table 20/H.225.0).

     3:  SIP Call-ID as defined in RFC 3261.

     4:  PacketCable Billing Call ID (BCID).

     5:  Text string using the US-ASCII character set.

     6:  Octet sting.

     7-255: Future growth.  

   Although the intent of this RFC is to list all currently known
   values of usable correlation tags, it is possible that new values
   may be defined in the future. An IANA registry of correlation
   tags is recommended.

   The tag length indicates the overall length of the sub-block in
   32 bit words and includes the tag type and length fields.

4.3 Algorithm description

   The Algorithm Description sub-block MAY be present however if present
   MUST be indicated in the MAP field
   The Algorithm descriptor is a bit field which indicates which
   algorithm is being described.  The bits are defined as:-

      Bit 0:      MOS-LQ Algorithm
      Bit 1:      MOS-CQ Algorithm
      Bit 2:      R-LQ Algorithm
      Bit 3:      R-CQ Algorithm
      Bit 4:      Video Monitoring Algorithm
      Bit 5:      Audio Monitoring Algorithm
      Bit 6:      Transmission Quality Monitoring Algorithm
      Bit 7:      Reserved and set to 0

  The descriptor length gives the overall length of the descriptor in
  32 bit words and includes the algorithm descriptor and length fields.

  The algorithm descriptor is a text field that contains the
  description or name of the algorithm.  If the algorithm name is 
  shorter than the length of the field then the trailing octets 
  must be set to 0x00.

  For example, an implementation may report:

      Algorithm descriptor = 0x10   - Video estimation algorithm
      Descriptor length = 3         - 3 words
      Descriptor = "Alg X" 0x00     - description

 
5. Practical Applications

5.1 Overview
   The objective of this section is to identify a number of cases in
   which there could potentially be some ambiguity in the application
   of the report blocks defined above or some exceptions to the 
   defined operation of the metrics.

7. IANA Considerations

8.  Security Considerations

   RTCP reports can contain sensitive information since they can provide
   information about the nature and duration of a session established
   between two endpoints.  As a result, any third party wishing to
   obtain this information should be properly authenticated and the
   information transferred securely.
