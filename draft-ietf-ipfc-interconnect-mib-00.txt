Abstract

This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
the Internet community.  In particular, it defines objects for
managing the operations of any Fibre Channel Interconnection device,
or set of devices.  An example of a Fibre Channel Interconnection would
be a FC-AL repeater (or hub) or a FC Fabric Switch.

       DESCRIPTION
           "Common Management information for Fibre Channel 
            Interconnection Devices.

           The following terms are used throughout this
           MIB module:

           Domain - A managed entity compliant with this MIB, 
           and incorporating at least one managed (Fibre Channel
           Interconnection) Device.

           Device - A managed entity that contains at least one
           Group of managed objects.  The direct management mechanism 
           for managing a device may, or may not, be SNMP.

           Group - A managed entity that (typically) contains at 
           least one Port.  The classical example allows 
           an implementor to represent field-replaceable units as 
           groups of ports, with the port numbering matching the
           modular hardware implementation.
