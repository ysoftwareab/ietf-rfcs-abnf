Abstract 
 
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control allows 
   each network element (NE) to perform resource discovery, routing and 
   signaling in a distributed manner. On the other hand, with the 
   development of software-defined transport networking technology, 
   central controllers are introduced to transport networks to control 
   a set of NEs.  

   In transport networks, the GMPLS control has many mature mechanisms 
   such as RSVP-TE, OSPF-TE, and LMP, so that GMPLS can be applied for 
   the NE-level control in the centralized controller systems.  

   This document describes how GMPLS control interworks with 
   centralized controller systems (e.g. ACTN) in transport network.

1. Introduction 

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] extends 
   MPLS to support different classes of interfaces and switching 
   capabilities such as Time-Division Multiplex Capable (TDM), Lambda 
   Switch Capable (LSC), and Fiber-Switch Capable (FSC). Each network 
   element (NE) running a control plane collects network information 
   from other NEs and provisions services through signaling in a 
   distributed manner.  

   On the other hand, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technologies 
   have been introduced to control the transport network in a 
   centralized manner. Central controllers, which can locate outside of 
   the network, can collect network information from each node and 
   provision services to corresponding nodes. One of the examples is 
   the Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) 
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-framework], which defines a hierarchical 
   architecture with PNC, MDSC and CNC as central controllers for 
   different network abstraction levels. 

   In such centralized controller systems, GMPLS can be applied for the 
   NE-level control. Introducing GMPLS in centralized controller system 
   can reuse the mature mechanisms defined for GMPLS and be practical 
   for legacy transport networks. This document describes how GMPLS 
   control interworks with centralized controller system in transport 
   network.

2. Overview 

   In this section, overviews of GMPLS control plane and centralized 
   controller system are discussed as well as the cooperation between 
   GMPLS control plane and centralized controller system. 

2.1. Overview of GMPLS Control Plane 

   GMPLS separates the control plane and the data plane to support 
   time-division, wavelength, and spatial switching, which are 
   significant in transport networks. For the NE level control in 
   GMPLS, each node has its controller to perform service provisioning, 
   protection, and restoration. At the same time, the controller can 
   negotiate available link resources with controllers in adjacent 
   nodes, and it can also collect node and link resources in the 
   network to construct the network topology and compute routing paths 
   for serving service requests. 

   Several protocols have been designed for GMPLS control [RFC3945] 
   including link management [RFC4204], signaling [RFC3471], and 
   routing [RFC4202] protocols. The controllers applying these 
   protocols communicate with each other to exchange resource 
   information and establish LSP. In this way, controllers in different 
   nodes in the network have the same network topology and provision 
   services by their local policies. 

2.2. Overview of Centralized Controller System 

   With the development of SDN technologies, centralized controller 
   system has been introduced to transport networks such as ACTN. In 
   centralized controller system, a controller is aware of the network 
   topology and is responsible for provisioning incoming service 
   requests. In ACTN, multiple abstraction levels are designed and 
   controllers at different levels implement different functions. This 
   kind of abstraction enables multi-vendor, multi-domain, and multi-
   technology control. 

   For example in ACTN, an MDSC coordinates several PNCs controlling 
   different domains. Each PNC reports its topology, which can be 
   abstracted, to the MDSC, so that the MDSC learns the picture of 
   multiple domains. When a multi-domain service arrives at the MDSC, 
   the MDSC first computes an end-to-end routing path. Then the MDSC 
   splits this path to multiple segment according to domain boundaries 
   and allocate each segment to corresponding PNC for detailed path 
   computation and LSP segment setup. After each PNC reporting the 
   establishment of corresponding LSP segment, this multi-domain 
   service is accommodated.

2.3. GMPLS Control Interwork with Centralized Controller System 

   Centralized controller system as ACTN provides the architecture and 
   communication between central controllers of different abstraction 
   levels to coordinate multiple domains. Within each domain, GMPLS 
   control can be applied to each NE. The bottom-level central 
   controller like PNC can act as a NE to collect network information 
   and initiate LSP. Following figure shows an example of GMPLS 
   interworking with ACTN.

   In Figure 1, each domain runs GMPLS control. The PNC listens LSAs 
   flooded in the domain and learns the topology. For path computation 
   in the domain with PNC implementing a PCE, NEs use PCEP to ask the 
   PNC for a path and get replies. The MDSC communicates with PNCs 
   using RESTConf or YANG models. As a PNC has learned its domain 
   topology, it can report the topology to the MDSC. When a service

   arrives, the MDSC computes the path and coordinates PNCs to 
   establish the corresponding LSP segment. 

3. Link Management Protocol 

   Link management protocol (LMP) [RFC4204] runs between a pair of 
   nodes and is used to manage TE links. In addition to setup and 
   maintain control channels, LMP can be used to verify the data link 
   connectivity and correlate the link property. In this way, link 
   resources, which are fundamental resources in the network, are 
   discovered by both ends of the link. 

4. Routing Options 

   In GMPLS control, link state information is flooded within the 
   network as defined in [RFC4202]. Each node in the network can build 
   the network topology according to the flooded link state 
   information. Routing protocols such as OSPF-TE [RFC4203] and ISIS-TE 
   [RFC5307] have been extended to support different interfaces in 
   GMPLS. 

   In centralized controller system, central controller can be placed 
   at the GMPLS network and passively receive the information flooded 
   in the network. In this way, the central controller can construct 
   and update the network topology.  

4.1. OSPF-TE 

   OSPF-TE is introduced for TE networks in [RFC3630]. OSPF extensions 
   have been defined in [RFC4203] to enable the capability of link 
   state information for GMPLS network. Based on this work, OSPF 
   protocol has been extended to support technology-specific routing. 
   The routing protocol for OTN, WSON and optical flexi-grid network 
   are defined in [RFC7138], [RFC7688] and [I-D.ietf-ccamp-flexible-
   grid-ospf-ext], respectively. 

4.2. ISIS-TE 

   ISIS-TE is introduced for TE networks in [RFC5305] and is extended 
   to support GMPLS routing functions [RFC5307], and has been updated 
   to [RFC7074] to support the latest GMPLS switching capability and 
   Types fields. 

5. Path Computation 

   Once a controller learn the network topology, it can utilize the 
   available resources to serve service requests by performing path

   computation. Path computation is one of the key objectives in 
   various types of controllers. In the given architecture, it is 
   possible for different components that have the capability to 
   compute the path.  

5.1. Constraint-based Path Computing in GMPLS Control 

   In GMPLS control, a routing path is computed by the ingress node 
   [RFC3473] and is based on the ingress node TED. Constraint-based 
   path computation is performed according to the local policy of the 
   ingress node. 

5.2. Path Computation Element (PCE) 

   PCE has been introduced in [RFC4655] as a functional component that 
   provides services to compute path in a network. In [RFC5440], the 
   path computation is accomplished by using the Traffic Engineering 
   Database (TED), which maintains the link resources in the network. 
   The emergence of PCE efficiently improve the quality of network 
   planning and offline computation, but there is a risk that the 
   computed path may be infeasible if there is a diversity requirement, 
   because stateless PCE has no knowledge about the former computed 
   paths.  

   To address this issue, stateful PCE has been proposed in [RFC8231]. 
   Besides the TED, an additional LSP Database (LSP-DB) is introduced 
   to archive each LSP computed by the PCE. In this way, PCE can easily 
   figure out the relationship between the computing path and former 
   computed paths. In this approach, PCE provides computed paths to 
   PCC, and then PCC decides which path is deployed and when to be 
   established.  

   In PCE Initiation [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp], PCE is allowed 
   to trigger the PCC to setup, maintenance, and teardown of the PCE-
   initiated LSP under the stateful PCE model. This would allow a 
   dynamic network that is centrally controlled and deployed. 

   In centralized controller system, the PCE can be implement in a 
   central controller, and the central controller performs path 
   computation according to its local policies. On the other hand, the 
   PCE can also be placed outside of the central controller. In this 
   case, the central controller acts as a PCC to request path 
   computation to the PCE through PCEP.

Internet-Draft        GMPLS and Controller Interwork        March 2018 


6. Signaling Options 

   Signaling mechanism is used to setup LSPs in GMPLS control. Messages 
   are sent hop by hop between the ingress node and the egress node of 
   the LSP to allocate labels. Once the labels are allocated along the 
   path, the LSP setup is accomplished. Signaling protocols such as 
   RSVP-TE [RFC3473] and CR-LDP [RFC3472] have been extended to support 
   different interfaces in GMPLS. 

   In centralized controller system, the central controller can manage 
   LSPs by using PCE-initiation [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] to 
   notify the corresponding ingress node. The ingress node will 
   maintain the LSP through GMPLS signaling. 

6.1. RSVP-TE 

   RSVP-TE is introduced in [RFC3209] and extended to support GMPLS 
   signaling in [RFC3473]. Several label formats are defined for a 
   generalized label request, a generalized label, suggested label and 
   label sets. Based on [RFC3473], RSVP-TE has been extended to support 
   technology-specific signaling. The RSVP-TE extensions for OTN, WSON, 
   optical flexi-grid network are defined in [RFC7139], [RFC7689], and 
   [RFC7792], respectively. 

6.2. CR-LDP 

   In order to support the label formats and signaling mechanism 
   defined in [RFC3471], CR-LDP is extended in [RFC3472]. Several label 
   formats are defined and bidirectional LSPs are supported. 

7. Interworking Scenarios 

7.1. Topology Collection & Synchronization 

   Topology information is necessary on both network elements and 
   controllers. The topology on network element is usually raw 
   information, while the topology on the controller can be either raw 
   or abstracted. Three different abstraction method has been described 
   in [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-framework], and different controllers can 
   select the corresponding method depending on application.  

   When there are changes in the network topology, the related network 
   element(s) need to report to all the other network elements, 
   together with the controller, to sync up the topology information. 
   The inter-NE synchronization can be achieved via protocols mentioned 
   in section 3 and 4. The topology synchronization between NE can 

 
 
Zheng                  Expires September 2018                  [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft        GMPLS and Controller Interwork        March 2018 


   controllers can either be achieved by PCEP-LS in [PCEP-LS] or 
   netconf protocol with YANG model.  

7.2. Multi-domain/layer Service Provisioning 

   Based on the topology information on controllers and network 
   elements, service provisioning can be deployed. Plenty of methods 
   have been specified for single domain service provisioning, such as 
   using PCEP and RSVP-TE.  

   Multi-domain/layer service provisioning would request coordination 
   among the controller hierarchies. Given the service request, the 
   end-to-end delivery procedure may include interactions on MPI and 
   SBI. The computation for a cross-domain/layer path is usually 
   completed by MDSC, who has a global view of the topologies. Then the 
   configuration is decomposed into lower layer controllers, including 
   both MDSC and PNCs, to configure the network elements to set up the 
   path.  

   A combination of the centralized and distributed protocols may be 
   necessary for the interaction between network elements and 
   controller. A typical example would be the PCE Initiation scenario, 
   in which a PCE message (PCInitiate) is sent from the controller to 
   the first-end node, and then trigger a RSVP procedure along the 
   path.  

7.3. Recovery  

   The GMPLS recovery functions are described in [RFC4426]. Two models, 
   span protection and end-to-end protection and restoration, are 
   discussed with different protection schemes and message exchange 
   requirements. Related RSVP-TE extensions to support end-to-end 
   recovery is described in [RFC4872]. The extensions in [RFC4872] 
   include protection, restoration, preemption, and rerouting 
   mechanisms for an end-to-end LSP. Besides end-to-end recovery, a 
   GMPLS segment recovery mechanism is defined in [RFC4873]. By 
   introducing secondary record route objects, LSP segment can be 
   switched to another path like fast reroute [RFC4090]. 

   For the recovery with controllers, timely interaction between 
   controller and network elements are required. Usually the re-routing 
   can be decomposed into path computation and delivery, the controller 
   can take some advantage in the path computation due to the global 
   topology view. And the delivery can be achieved by the procedure 
   described in section 7.2.

7.4. Controller Reliability  

   Given the important role in the network, the reliability of 
   controller is critical. Once a controller is shut down, the network 
   should operate as well. It can be either achieved by controller back 
   up or functionality back up. There are several of controller backup 
   or federation mechanisms in the literature. It is also more reliable 
   to have some function back up in the network element, to guarantee 
   the performance in the network.
