Internet-Draft        IPv6 Subnet Models for 802.16       September 2006


1.  Introduction

   802.16 [1] [2]is a connection oriented access technology for the last
   mile without optimal bi-directional native multicast support.
   Traditionally IP protocols (e.g.  ARP, IPv6 ND) assume the
   availability of multicast at the link layer.  This is further
   complicated by the definition of commercial network models like
   WiMAX, which defines the Service Flows that extends the 802.16b MAC
   transport connection all the way to an Access Router by using a
   tunnel between BS and AR.  This leads to multiple ways of deploying
   IP over 802.16 based networks.

   This document looks at various considerations in selecting a subnet
   model for 802.16 based networks and provides analysis of the various
   possible subnet models.


2.  Terminology

   An end-user equipment that provides connectivity to 802.16 based
   networks.  The terms Subscriber Station (SS), Mobile Node (MN) and
   host are used synonymously with MS in this document.

   Base Station (BS): A generalized equipment sets providing
   connectivity, management, and control of the subscriber station (SS).

   Access Router: An entity, which performs IP routing function to
   provide IP connectivity for MSs.  In WiMAX Networks, the AR is an ASN
   Gateway.

   IP Link: This has been defined in RFC 2461 as below.
      - a communication facility or medium over which nodes can
      communicate at the link layer, i.e., the layer immediately below
      IP.  Examples are Ethernets (simple or bridged), PPP links, X.25,
      Frame Relay, or ATM networks as well as internet (or higher) layer
      "tunnels", such as tunnels over IPv4 or IPv6 itself.

   Point-to-multipoint: A link consists of a single interface
   communicating directly with more than one interface.


3.  IPv6 Subnet Models for 802.16 based Networks

   This section provides various IPv6 subnet models for 802.16 based
   networks and provides their operational considerations in practical
   deployment scenarios.

3.1.  Shared Prefix Model

   The following figures illustrates high level view of the subnet model
   using shared prefix for IPv6 link wherein one more prefixes
   advertised on the link would be used by the all nodes attached to the
   IPv6 link.

               Figure 2. Shared Prefix Subnet Model: BS and AR in one box



   The above figure shows the case where BS and AR co-exist as a single
   entity.

   In the shared prefix model, the link between the MS and the AR at the
   IPv6 layer is viewed as a shared link and the lower layer link
   between the MS and BS is a point-to-point link.  This point-to-point
   link between the MS and BS is extended all the way to the AR when the
   granularity of the tunnel between the BS and AR is on a per MS basis.
   This is illustrated in the following figure below.



          MS

               Figure 3. IPv6 Shared Prefix Link Model



   In the shared prefix mode, an AR can serve one or more BSs.  All MSs
   connected to BSs that are served by an AR are on the same IPv6 link.

3.1.1.  Prefix Assignment

   One or more IPv6 prefixes are assigned to the link and hence shared
   by all the nodes that are attached to the link.  The prefixes are
   advertised with autonomous flag (A-Flag) set and the On-link flag
   (L-flag) reset for address autoconfiguration so that the nodes may
   not make on-link assumption for the addresses whose prefix matches
   with sending node prefix.

Internet-Draft        IPv6 Subnet Models for 802.16       September 2006


3.1.2.  Address Autoconfiguration

   Both link local and global addresses are autoconfigured as specified
   in [4].  The Interface Identifier is generated from its MAC address
   as per [6].  The MS may also generate random Interface Identifiers as
   per the privacy extensions specification for address
   autoconfiguration as per [5].  The address configured through
   stateless address autoconfiguration must pass the duplicate address
   detection test before being assigned to the interface as the IPv6
   link is being share with the nodes.

3.1.3.  Duplicate Address Detection

   The DAD procedure as specified in [4] does not adapt well to the
   802.16 air interface.  An optimization, called Relay DAD, may be
   required to perform DAD.  For more details refer [?].

3.1.4.  Considerations

3.1.4.1.  Reuse of existing standards

   The shared prefix model uses the existing specification and does not
   required any protocol changes or any new protocols.  However this
   model requires implementation changes for DAD optimization.

3.1.4.2.  On-link Multicast Support

   No native on-link multicast is possible with this method.  However
   the AR can implement proxy mechanism for the in-link multicast if
   required.

3.1.4.3.  Consistency in IP Link Definition

   The definition of IPv6 link is consistent for all procedures and
   functionalities except for the support of native on-link multicast
   support.  However this can be supported with AR proxying for the
   multicast packets, which may increase the complexity of the AR
   implementation.

3.1.4.4.  Packet Forwarding

   All MSs send the packets to the AR irrespective of the destination
   and scope of the IPv6 address.  AR handles the packets with IPv6
   global addresses normally.  However the packets with link local
   destination addresses are relayed by the AR to destination without
   decrementing the hop-limit.

Internet-Draft        IPv6 Subnet Models for 802.16       September 2006


3.1.4.5.  Effect on Dormant Mode

   This subnet model does not use any multicast and has no adverse
   effect on MSs that are in dormant mode.

3.1.4.6.  Changes on Host Implementation

   This subnet model does not require any implementation changes on the
   host side.  However the hosts required to perm duplicate address
   detection for all addresses even if the host is reusing the interface
   identifier.

3.1.4.7.  Changes on Router Implementation

   This subnet model requires major implementation changes on the AR for
   supporting Relay DAD.  Relay DAD requires the maintenance of Address
   Cache containing the list of all addresses that are in use on a
   particular link.  This can be affected by the packet loss, host not
   performing DAD when reusing the IID.  There can also be possible DoS
   attack from the hosts by configuring more number of addresses to
   overflow the address cache which requires the operator to limit the
   number of IPv6 address a host can have at any given instance.

3.1.4.8.  Renumbering

   It is easy to renumber the IPv6 link with this model and requires
   just one more prefix.  The number of prefixes required to renumber is
   O(1) compared to point-to-point link model which requires O(n) where
   n is the number of hosts attached to the AR, 1 < n < 2^64.

3.1.4.9.  SeND Support

   This subnet model is SeND friendly.

3.1.5.  Applicability

   This subnet model works with IPv6 CS and is chosen by the WiMAX
   Networks by the WiMAX Forum Network Working Group.

3.2.  Unique Prefix per MN

   In WiMAX, the link between mobile node and AR is established when
   mobile node enters the network.  This process is called initial
   service flow (ISF) establishment.  ISF is composed of two segments,
   an air-link between the mobile node and BS and a tunnel between BS
   and AR.  After ISF is established, AR which acts as the first hop
   router and mobile node take part in stateless address configuration
   and mobile node is allocated one or more unique prefixes.  These

Internet-Draft        IPv6 Subnet Models for 802.16       September 2006


   prefixes are not shared by any other nodes.  The unique prefix per
   mobile node address model follows the recommendations of [7].

   The point-to-point connection between the AR and mobile node can be
   implemented at the physical/MAC level.  One way to accomplish this is
   to run PPP on the link [7].  However PPP cannot be used because IEEE
   802.16 did not define PPP Convergence Sublayer.  Instead, from IP
   layer perspective, ISF can be viewed as a virtual point to point
   link, called virtual link.  It is straightforward to implement the
   virtual links on IPv6, Ethernet and VLAN [9] Convergence Sublayers.

3.2.1.  Prefix Assignment

   If PPP is run on the link, no prefix assignment is necessary.  The
   ASN Gateway uses IPV6CP to assign an address to the mobile node's PPP
   interface.

   If PPP is not run on the link, prefixes are assigned to the link
   using standard RFC 2461 Router Advertisement and Router Solicitation/
   Router Advertisement mechanisms.  The AR assigns a unique prefix or
   set of prefixes for each mobile node to AR link by including Prefix
   Advertisement Options for only those prefixes, when Router
   Advertisements are sent to the mobile node on the link.  The 'L' flag
   in the Prefix Advertisement Option is set to 1, because the prefixes
   are on link.

3.2.2.  Link Local Address Autoconfiguration

   Mobile nodes perform link local address autoconfiguration exactly as
   specified in RFC 2462, including duplicate address detection.
   Because there is only one other node on the link, the AR, there is
   only a possibility of an address conflict with the AR.  This conflict
   can be easily avoided if the AR's link local address is taken into
   consideration when forming a link local address on the mobile node.

3.2.3.  Global Address Autoconfiguration

   Mobile nodes perform global address autoconfiguration exactly as in
   RFC 2462, including duplicate address detection.  The interface
   identifier can be either an EUI-64 identifier or a SEND CGI
   identifier, or possibly some other as yet undefined interface
   identifier generation scheme.  Again, there is only a possibility of
   an address collision with the AR, so collisions are statistically
   very unlikely, and easy to fix if they should occur.

   If DHCP is used for address configuration ('M=1' in the Router
   Advertisement), the DHCP server must provide addresses with a
   separate prefix per mobile node.  The prefix must of course match

Internet-Draft        IPv6 Subnet Models for 802.16       September 2006


   whatever prefix the ASN Gateway has advertised to the mobile node (if
   any).

3.2.4.  Considerations

3.2.4.1.  Reuse of existing standards

   This solution reuses RFC 2461, 2462, and if PPP is used, RFC 2472.
   No changes in these protocols are required, the protocols must only
   be configured properly.

   If PPP is not used, any VLAN solution, such as IEEE 802.1Q [9], can
   be used

3.2.4.2.  On-link Multicast Support

   Since the link between a mobile node and the AR is point to point,
   any multicast can only be sent by one or the other node.  Link local
   multicast between other nodes and the AR will not be seen will not be
   seen.

3.2.4.3.  Consistency in IP Link Definition

   The IP link is fully consistent with a standard IP link, without
   exception.  The definition is as a point-to-point link.

3.2.4.4.  Packet Forwarding

   The mobile node always sends all packets to the AR, because it is the
   only other node on the link.  Link local unicast and multicast
   packets are also forwarded only between the two.

   When the unique prefix per mobile node model is used, the BS acts as
   a bridge.  For each mobile node, the BS bridges the unique prefix or
   set of prefixes assigned by the AR to the link between itself and the
   mobile node.  This means, in particular, that the per mobile node
   prefix or set of prefixes are routed on both sides (wireless and
   wired) of the BS, and that the BS needs to participate in all 802
   standard bridging protocols.

3.2.4.5.  Effect on Dormant Mode

   The AR can simply send link local multicast, for example unsolicited
   Router Advertisements, and the BS can filter them out.  The BS knows
   whether a particular mobile node is in dormant mode based on 802.16e
   signaling.  This does not require any additional IP level or MAC
   level protocol between the BS and AR.

Internet-Draft        IPv6 Subnet Models for 802.16       September 2006


   If the mobile node is in dormant mode and the AR receives a packet
   for one of the mobile node's global addresses (unicast or subscribed
   multicast), it can send a Neighbor Solicitation to awaken the mobile
   node, according to standard RFC 2461 procedures (note that the AR
   could even time out the mobile node's Neighbor Cache entry as is
   usual for IPv6, but there are other reasons why this might not be
   desirable).  Upon receipt of the Neighbor Solicitation at the BS, the
   BS can initiate paging procedures using the 802.16e paging signaling.
   When the traffic channel is up, the BS can forward the Neighbor
   Solicitation to the mobile node over the traffic channel, and the
   mobile node can reply with a Neighbor Advertisement that the BS then
   forwards to the AR.  In this way, dormant mode paging falls out as a
   natural consequence of standard IPv6 local link Neighbor Discovery
   mechanisms, rather than requiring additional protocol support.

3.2.4.6.  Changes on Host Implementation

   Host implementations follow standard IPv6 stack procedures.  No
   changes needed.

3.2.4.7.  Changes on Router Implementation

   If PPP is used, no changes in router implementations are needed.  If
   PPP is not used, the AR must be capable of doing the following:
   1.  Each mobile node is assigned a separate VLAN when 802.1X [10] or
       other link level authentication procedures are complete,
   2.  The AR must be configured to include a unique prefix or set of
       prefixes for each mobile node.  This unique prefix or set of
       prefixes must be included in Router Advertisements every time
       they are sent, and, if DHCP is used, the addresses leased to the
       mobile node must include only the unique advertised prefixes.

   Note that, depending on the router implementation, these functions
   may or may not be possible with simple configuration.  No protocol
   changes are required, however.

3.2.4.8.  Renumbering

   Compared to the shared subnet prefix model, per-MS subnet prefix has
   more signaling traffic while renumbering.

3.2.4.9.  SeND Support

   SEND is fully supported by this model.  Even though the link is point
   to point, mobile nodes and ARs are still encouraged to use SEND.

Internet-Draft        IPv6 Subnet Models for 802.16       September 2006


3.2.5.  Applicability

   In enterprise networks, shared services including printers, fax
   machines, and other such on-line services are often available in on
   the local link.  These services are typically discovered using some
   kind of link local service discovery protocol.  The unique prefix per
   mobile node model is not appropriate for these kinds of deployments,
   since it is not possible to have shared link services in the ASN.

   The unique prefix per mobile node model is applicable to deployments
   where there are no shared services in the ASN.  Such deployments are
   typical of service provider networks where a public access wireless
   network is being provided.  Cellular networks such as UMTS are an
   example.

3.3.  Ethernet Like Model

   The following figures illustrates an example of Ethernet like shared
   prefix model.  Important point here is that Ethernet like subnet
   prefix model essentially functions like real Ethernet model, which
   means the model works as described in [3], [4].

   There are some interesting questions about how to support IPv6 over
   Ethernet like shared model since full Ethernet functionality may be
   implemented on top of IEEE 802.16 point-to-multipoint links.  In the
   Ethernet like shared model, an IPv6 prefix is shared by multiple MSs
   on top of IEEE 802.16 point-to-multipoint links.  So, there are some
   considerations about DAD optimization.  It also needs to describe a
   scheme for configuration and provisioning of an IEEE 802.16 network
   so that it emulates a broadcast network in a manner similar to
   Ethernet.  In addition, multiple access routers can exist.

   One way to construct an Ethernet like shared link is to implement
   bridging between all BSs with IEEE 802.16 providing the links between
   the MSs and the bridge on top of the BS like switched Ethernet.

3.3.1.  Prefix Assignment

   In this model, multiple BSs and MSs form an IPv6 subnet and multiple
   prefixes are allocated to the IPv6 subnet.  All MSs attached to
   different BSs under the same AR, can be on same IPv6 subnet.
   Multiple access routers can exist.  Prefixes are assigned as
   specified in [3], [4].

3.3.2.  Address Autoconfiguration

   Like other IEEE 802 interfaces, the Interface Identifier for an IEEE
   802.16 interface is based on the EUI-64 identifier derived from the
   interface's built-in 48-bit IEEE 802 address.  The IPv6 link-local
   address for an IEEE 802.16 interface is formed by appending the
   Interface Identifier to the link-local prefix.  A MS can generate an
   Identifier of an IPv6 address by computing a cryptographic hash of
   the public key.  CGAs can be also supported.  The address must do the
   duplicate address detection before being assigned to the interface.

Internet-Draft        IPv6 Subnet Models for 802.16       September 2006


3.3.3.  Duplicate Address Detection

   The DAD procedure as specified in [3] does not adapt well.  Any
   optimizations that may be possible to reduce DAD packets are
   required.  A DAD optimization may be required for the Ethernet like
   shared prefix model.

3.3.4.  Considerations

3.3.4.1.  Reuse of existing standards

   All the IPv6 standards can be preserved or reused, but the scope is
   limited or some implementation changes for DAD or on-link multicast
   optimization is required.

3.3.4.2.  On-link Multicast Support

   Downlink connections can be shared among multiple MSs, enabling
   multicast channels with multiple MSs receiving the same information
   from the BS.  Multicast is not enabled in the uplink but must be
   realized by an entity on top the IEEE802.16 MAC sending packets
   received on a unicast uplink downstream on a multicast channel.

   So, on-link multicast can be emulated by efficiently bridging between
   all BSs with IEEE 802.16 providing the links between the MSs and the
   bridge on top of the BS, and/or downlink multicast.  Any
   optimizations that may be possible to reduce the on-link multicast
   are required.

3.3.4.3.  Consistency in IP Link Definition

   This model has consistency in IP link definition.

3.3.4.4.  Packet Forwarding

   When properly configured and assisted by a simple bridging function,
   IEEE 802.16 can emulate a simple broadcast network like Ethernet.

3.3.4.5.  Effect on Dormant Mode

   Ethernet-like broadcast transmission does not only consume more radio
   resources than usually needed for unicast transmission but also
   causes the MSs to receive and process the packets regardless of the
   necessity.  Especially in mobile networks with many stations staying
   for long periods in idle modes and power down modes this causes a
   considerable consumption of scarce battery power.

3.3.4.6.  Changes on Host Implementation

   No special impact on host implementation except bridging or multilink
   subnet functions for Ethernet like broadcast (multicast) network
   emulation.

3.3.4.7.  Changes on Router Implementation

   No special impact on router implementation under a separated AR-BS
   model, if bridging is implemented in BS.  Some networks e.g.  WiMAX
   Networks may require bridging to be implemented in AR (ASN Gateway).

3.3.4.8.  Renumbering

   It is easy to renumber the IPv6 link with this model and requires
   just one more prefix and one router advertisement.

3.3.4.9.  SeND Support

   SEND is fully supported by this model.

3.3.5.  Applicability

   This model is applicable for both IPv6 CS and Ethernet CS, but in
   terms of supporting plain end-to-end Ethernet connectivity, Ethernet
   CS may be more appropriate than IPv6 CS.


4.  Conclusions and Relevant Subnet Model

   TBD


5.  Security Considerations

   This document provides the analysis of various IPv6 subnet models for
   802.16 based networks and does not introduce any new security
   threats.  Nonetheless, this document encourages usage of SeND for
   securing the neighbor discovery messages on any IPv6 link.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
