1.  Introduction

   While more and more operators begin to provide the wireless broadband
   network systems, the needs for multicast and and broadcast service in
   mobile network become promising.  Recently IPTV might become one of
   the desirable applications for mobile network.  Mobile IPTV service
   is a kind of A/V services which are combined with interactive data
   for the related or supplementary information of A/V program using bi-
   directional wireless broadband links.  User can enjoy the downlink
   A/V stream and access more detailed or value-added information via
   uplink simultaneously.

   In the mobile network, Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4)[RFC3344], Mobile
   IPv6[RFC3775], DSMIP6 [DSMIPv6] and PMIP6[Gundavelli08]is the basic
   way to support IP mobility management.  It allows the mobile
   nodes(MN) to maintain the reachability while moving in the IP
   network.  After registration to home agent(HA), the packets destined
   to MN could be routed correctly by using the tunneling mechanism,
   while MN is away from the home network.

   But the current IP mobility management mechanism lack of full support
   of multicast service.This document will illustrate the main issue of
   them.  Since DSMIP6 is principally similar to MIP6, so it will not be
   illustrated independently in this document.

2.  IP mobility management multicast support in mobile network

2.1.  Mobile IPTV multicast framework

   ITU make detailed description on IPTV architecture and multicast
   framewroks.  Mobile IPTV content delivery infrastructure may consists
   of four different layers, i.e.  Content Source, Core, Metro(Edge),
   and Access.  Content source is where IPTV service contents are
   originated and they can be placed in either inside or outside of
   delivery infrastructure.  Core is service/network provider_is
   backbone infrastructure.  Metro, in other words Aggregation or Edge,
   is where it connects and aggregates between core and access.  Access
   is user domain that includes last mile.

   The transport profile of Mobile IPTV are shown in the picture below:

             Wired or Wireless
                   |
                   | +.........................................+
   +----------+    | . Mobile IPTV Transport Profile           .
   |  Mobile  |    V .  +--------+      +------+      +------+ .
   |   IPTV   |---------| Access |------| Edge |------| Core | .
   | Terminal |      .  +--------+      +------+      +------+ .
   +----------+      .                    //           ||  ||  .
                     .                   //            ||  ||  .
                     .    +-------------+              ||  ||  .
                     .    | Content     |==============||  ||  .
                     .    | Source      |                  ||  .
                     .    +-------------+                  ||  .
                     +................\\...................||..+
                                       \\                  ||
                                        +----------------+ ||
                                        | content source |==
                                        +----------------+


   In the case of IPTV support in mobile network, such architecture will
   be considered and mapped to the network entity of IP mobility
   management.

2.2.  Mobile IPv4 support Multicast

   Section 4.3 and 4.4 of [RFC3344] discuss the support of multicast and
   broadcast.  In order to receive multicast packet through it's home
   network, a mobile node MUST join the multicast group in one of two
   ways.  One is based on co-located care-of address, the other is based
   on the home address (foreign agent care-of address).  In both cases,
   a mobile node tunnels IGMP messages to its home agent, the home agent

   forwards multicast datagrams down the tunnel to the mobile node.

                Access network
             (Wired or Wireless)                     IP multicast
                     |                                  packets
      +----+         |                                    |
      | MN1|         V     +------+             +------+  |
      +----+---------------|======|=============|      |  |
      +----+               |  FA  |             |  HA  |  V
      | MN2|---------------|======|=============|      |-----
      +----+               +------+             +------+

             Figure 1: Nested tunneling in MIP4 for Multicast

   In the case of co-located care-of address, the home agent SHOULD
   tunnel the datagram to this care-of address directly; In the case of
   foreign agent care-of address, the home agent MUST first encapsulate
   the datagram in a unicast datagram addressed to the mobile node's
   home address and then MUST tunnel the resulting datagram (nested
   tunneling) to the mobile node's care-of address.If there are more
   than 500 MNs under the same FA, there will be 500 tunnels between HA
   and FA to transmit multicast packets.

2.3.  Mobile IPv6 support Multicast

   In this document, the analysis on multicast of mobile IPv6 will be
   made only based on mobile IPTV.  The Home Agent(HA) may be part of
   the core function in the mobile IPTV framework.  The edge function
   normally coould be considered as the access gateway(AGW) in the
   deployment of mobile IPv6 in mobile network.

            Access network
             (Wired or Wireless)                     IP multicast
      +------+       |                                  packets
      |      |       |                                      |
      |  MN  |       V       +------+             +------+  |
      |      |===============|======|=============|      |  |
      +------+               |      |             |      |  V
       bi-dictional tunnel   |  AR  |             |  HA  |-----
      +------+               |      |             |      |
      |      |===============|======|=============|      |
      |  MN  |               +------+             +------+
      |      |

   mobile IPTV service events.

   By the way, it is recommended that DSMIP6 has similar situation, and
   Proxy mobile IPv6 will be described in a seperate document.

3.  Security Considerations

   Multicast security is one of the most crucial issues in mobile IPTV
   service such that it is required to provide security capabilities to
   protect mobile IPTV multicast network from any malicious attempts
   caused by multicast security holes such as denial of service attacks.

   After the integration IP mobility management like MIP4, MIP6 with the
   multicast service, it should not depreciate the security protection
   of the basic IP mobility management mechanism.
