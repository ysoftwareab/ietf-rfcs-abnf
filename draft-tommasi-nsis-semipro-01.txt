Internet-Draft     Semi-Proactive QoS Re-establishment         August 2006


Abstract

   Re-establishment of the QoS after a Mobile Node handover must be done 
   as quickly as possible in order to reduce degradation or interruption 
   of the QoS and it is especially useful when realtime applications are 
   used. 
   We propose a Semi-Proactive procedure for a fast QoS re-establishment 
   in environments where there are Mobile Nodes. The basic idea of this 
   procedure is to perform as many operation as possible before the 
   handover (in a proactive way). Resources are reserved only after 
   the handover on the effective new data path, in order to avoid their
   waste.
   Moreover, we propose to buffer at the Candidate CRossover Node - 
   CCRN (an intermediate node on end-to-end data path) the packets 
   directed to the Mobile Node during the handover. In this way the 
   total QoS re-establishment time is reduced. This buffering also 
   guarantees, for the buffered packets, the same QoS treatment of the 
   other packets (the no-buffered ones).

1 Introduction

   Mobile IP [1][2] is a protocol that allows a Mobile Node(MN) to 
   communicate to other Internet nodes after changing its link-layer 
   point of attachment without loosing its IP address.
   Thus, the Mobile IP provides the node to maintain a higher-layer 
   connection while moving.
   NSIS Working Group[3] uses a two layer architecture for a signaling 
   protocol:
     - NTLP (GIST) [4] carries signaling messages between neighboring 
       peers; 
     - QoS-NSLP [5] manages resource reservation.

Internet-Draft     Semi-Proactive QoS Re-establishment         August 2006



   In order to allow the signal packets to have a secure path, GIST 
   provides the modality "connection" creating the GIST state so that
   there is an association between the adjacent GIST nodes. This 
   association is known as Messaging Association.

   According to the regular specification of the NSIS protocols the re-
   establishment of the QoS occurs after the handover, the so called
   reactive way. This means that both NTLP and QoS-NSLP act after the 
   handover in order to re-establish the proper QoS on the New path.

   Resource reservation on the New path must be done as quickly as 
   possible in order to reduce the degradation of QoS for the MN which is
   especially important when real-time applications are used.
   A basic idea for reducing such delay could be to re-establish QoS 
   before the handover on all the possible future paths, that is to act in 
   a proactive way. 
   Of course this means that there will be a waste of resources since 
   they are assigned on all Candidate paths and we have no guarantee that 
   the handover will occur.

   We therefore, propose to take the pros of both mechanism by
   creating the Messaging Associations in a proactive way and by assigning
   resources in the reactive way. We may say that we are acting in a
   Semi-Proactive way.
   Adopting this solution we anticipate the creation of the GIST state 
   before the handover. The resource reservation is as usual performed 
   after the handover but the total time will be minimal.
   Moreover, resources are assigned only to the effective path to  
   avoid their waste.

   In our solution the re-establishment is faster also because we 
   introduce the possibility of buffering the packets directed to MN, in
   an intermediate node of the end-to-end path. This node is known as the
   Candidate CRossover Node (CCRN).    


   This type of solution is a case of: 
     -  Predictive routing (section 3.3 of [4]) defined as a predictive
        installation of the state on the path that will be used after a 
        MN handover; 
     -  Path-decoupled signaling as defined in [3].

   Consequently, implementing this solution does not need to introduce new 
   messages in the QoS-NSLP and NTLP protocols but only a new Message 
   Routing Method (MRM) will be added. This describes the algorithm for
   discovering both the CCRN and the route which signaling messages should 
   take (see section 4). 
   The procedures described in the following paragraphs are applicable 
   in networks served by Mobile IPv4 with Route Optimization [6] or 
   by Mobile IPv6 (in which the Route Optimization is already integrated).

3 Semi-Proactive Procedure from the NSLP point of view

   In following paragraphs we will present a detailed description of 
   the main phases of the Semi-Proactive procedure.


3.1 Introduction to the procedure

   Let us first recall that QoS-NSLP supports both the sender-initiated
   and the receiver-initiated reservation. 
   The entity that sends the RESERVE message takes the name of QoS NSIS 
   Initiator (QNI) and the entity that receives that message is called 
   QoS NSIS Responder (QNR). The intermediary NSIS-aware takes the name 
   of QoS NSIS Entity (QNE). 
   In the case of sender-initiated reservation (figure 1), the RESERVE 
   message travels in the same direction of the data flow. Therefore, 
   the QNI is the NSIS-aware node that is closer to the sender of that
   flow.
   Moreover, going through the nodes, the same RESERVE message allows the 
   GIST to create its state.
   In the case of a receiver-initiated reservation (figure 2), the 
   RESERVE message travels in the opposite direction to the data flow.

Internet-Draft     Semi-Proactive QoS Re-establishment         August 2006

   Therefore, the QNI is the NSIS-aware node that is closer to the afore
   mentioned flow receiver. In this case, due to asymmetric routing, 
   the QNR must send a QUERY message to allow the GIST to create its
   state.

Internet-Draft     Semi-Proactive QoS Re-establishment         August 2006



   The Semi-Proactive procedure, presented in this draft, proposes to 
   re-establish the QoS as fast as possible. 

   The best way is to initiate, in a proactive way, as many operations as 
   possible but without the waste of the available resources.
   In order to do this we propose to create the GIST state before the
   handover and to reserve the resources on the New path after the moving 
   of the MN. The RESERVE message therefore, can only be sent after the 
   handover.

   In case of receiver-initiated reservation (figure 3) it is easy to 
   define a separation between the creation of the state and the 
   reservation of the resources. In fact, it is only necessary that the 
   QNR (close to the sender of data flow) sends the QUERY message 
   before the handover and the QNI responds with the RESERVE message after 
   the movement of the MN.

   The problem is the separation of the two phases when the reservation 
   is sender-initiated. 
   Therefore, also in this case, we could send a QUERY message in order
   to obtain the separation between the GIST state creation and the 
   resource reservation (figure 4).

     Figure 4 : Sender-initiated Semi-Proactive QoS Re-establishment




   In addition, we would like to consider that in the proactive phase 
   the PAR has already available a list of CARs. Each one of these could 
   act like or as a QNI or as a QNR depending on the type of reservation; 
   so it would send or receive the QUERY message for the GIST state 
   creation.


   The procedure consists of three main sections:
     1. Triggering, in which the PAR communicates to the correct end-
       point so that it sends the QUERY message.
     2. Proactive, in which the QUERY message allows the creation of
       the GIST state and the discovery of the CCRN.
     3. Reactive, in which the resources are reserved.

3.2 Triggering section


   Triggering section is the first phase of the procedure proposed in 
   this draft and it is composed by two main steps.
   In the first step the MN asks the PAR for the list of the CARs and
   notifies the   PAR to send the trigger message.
   In the second step if the MN is the sender of the data flow, the PAR 
   triggers each CAR for creating a GIST state towards the CN. Instead, 
   if the MN is the receiver of the data flow, the PAR triggers the CN 
   for creating a GIST state on each Candidate path towards the CARs.


3.3 Proactive section 
 
   The aim of this section is to describe the creation of the GIST state 
   in a proactive way.


3.3.1 Classification of the end-points

   In NSIS a resource reservation can be sender or receiver-initiated.
   In the first case, the sender of the data flow is the starter of the 
   reservation while for the receiver-initiated reservation the receiver
   would be the starter.

   From the MN point of view two other cases exist: the MN can be the 
   sender or the receiver of the data stream.

   This means that we have the following possible combinations as shown in
   figure 5.




        +---------------------+----------------------------------+
        |           \  MN     |     Sender      |   Receiver     |
        |Reservation \        |                 |                |
        +---------------------+-----------------+----------------+
        | Sender-initiated    | CAR=QNI,CN=QNR  | CAR=QNR,CN=QNI |
        +---------------------+-----------------+----------------+
        | Receiver-initiated  | CAR =QNR,CN=QNI | CAR =QNI,CN=QNR|
        +---------------------+-----------------+----------------+

              Figure 5 : Nodes in the Proactive phase



   According to the current definition of NSIS a QoS-NSLP RESERVE 
   message travels from QNI to QNR and the QoS-NSLP QUERY  follows the 
   data flow direction.

Internet-Draft     Semi-Proactive QoS Re-establishment         August 2006



3.3.2 Receiver-initiated reservation

   The QUERY message is sent by QNR node in downstream direction 
   towards the QNI. 

   A Mobility flag (M flag) is added in the Generic flags that are in the
   QoS-NSLP Common Header. This allows a QNE to distinguish the Semi-
   Proactive procedure from the regular NSIS procedure.
   When QNI receives this message it waits the end of the handover to 
   respond with a RESERVE message that contains Mobility flag.

   No other messages, TLV objects or fields are needed.  


3.3.3 Sender-initiated reservation    

   The QUERY message is sent in a downstream direction in the same way
   as the receiver-initiated reservation, but in this case the message 
   travels from the QNI to the QNR.
   After the handover, the QNR that has received a QUERY message will 
   wait for the RESERVE message with the Mobility flag, without taking 
   any other action.


3.3.4 Proactive selection of the CAR

   In order to optimize this procedure it is possible to define a 
   selective algorithm to choose a given CAR from the set of CARs using 
   information such as the characteristic of the service offered by the 
   CAR.   
   The definition of such algorithm is out of the scope to this version 
   of the document. 


3.4 Reactive section

   In this paragraph we will define the procedures carried out after 
   the MN handover.
   The GIST state has been installed, as previously mentioned, in the
   paths between the CN and each CAR.
   The resource reservation is performed only on the path from the QNI 
   to the QNR in a reactive way.

   The possible scenarios are described in the following figure.

     |           \  MN     |     Sender      |   Receiver     |
     |Reservation \        |                 |                |
     +---------------------+-----------------+----------------+
     | Sender-initiated    | NAR=QNI,CN=QNR  | NAR=QNR,CN=QNI |
     +---------------------+-----------------+----------------+
     | Receiver-initiated  | NAR =QNR,CN=QNI | NAR =QNI,CN=QNR|
     +---------------------+-----------------+----------------+

           Figure 6 : Nodes in the Reactive phase


   After the handover the QNI will send a RESERVE message. The QNR will 
   answer with a RESPONSE message. Both messages contain the Mobility 
   flag.
   In order to benefit from this procedure the NAR must be one of the 
   CARs otherwise there wouldn't be a GIST state with the CN and the
   procedure from Semi-Proactive would become totally Reactive.

   In this phase we perform the Local Path Repair procedure instead of the
   Path Repair, using the CRN discovered during the creation of the GIST 
   state. 
   The Path Repair consists of reserving resources for a session in the 
   New path and to tear down the old reservation on the Old path for the 
   same session.

   To understand the Local Path Repair, the following definitions are 
   given:
      - Local Old path is the path between PAR and CRN;
      - Local New path is the path between NAR and CRN;
      - Local Update path is the path between CN and CRN;

   What happens is that, in the Local New path, the resources must be 
   reserved (RESERVE massage) and torn down in the Local Old path (RESERVE
   massage with TEAR flag set) while updated in the Local Update path 
   (RESERVE massage with REPLACE flag set).


4 Semi-Proactive Procedure by the GIST point of view

   The fundamental aim of the GIST protocol is to discover the path 
   in which signaled data will follow and to create a GIST state between 
   the end-points of the data flow.

   On the basis of what has already been said previously, in networks 
   where there are MNs it is better to create a proactive GIST state 
   on all of the Candidate paths.

   The GIST protocol during the creation of the GIST state discovers the 
   CCRN.
   The algorithm for the discovery is quite simple thanks to the 
   information contained in the GIST-Query, GIST-Response and GIST-Confirm 
   messages. At the end of the proactive phase there will be therefore, as 
   many GIST state as the nodes contained in the CAR list.

Internet-Draft     Semi-Proactive QoS Re-establishment         August 2006



   In order to implement the Semi-Proactive mechanism a new Message 
   routing method (MRM) is used. This MRM is called Semi-Proactive MRM.  
   The document in [4] describes the path-coupled MRM which is applied 
   when signaling messages follow the route defined by an existing flow in 
   the network. 
   Semi-Proactive MRM describes the algorithm for realizing Predictive 
   routing and path-decoupled signaling. It also contains information 
   for discovering the CCRN and the route that signaling messages 
   should take.
   It transports information of the newly discovered CCRN to the other 
   QNE on the path.
   Details of the Semi-Proactive MRM will be provided in future version 
   of this document.


4.1 CCRN and CRN

   Both CCRN and CRN have an important role in the procedures described 
   in this draft.
   It is potentially possible to discover as many CCNRs as CARs. In the 
   proactive phase, if the MN is the receiver of the data flow, the 
   CCRNs buffers the packets sent to the MN during the handover (as 
   described in paragraph 5).

   In the reactive phase the CRN will be the principle node of the Local 
   path Repair (see paragraph 3.4).


4.2 CCRN Discovery

   If the MN is the data flow sender the CCRN could be 
   the first NSIS-aware node in which the Old and the Candidate 
   path converge.
   If the MN and the receiver of the data flow the CCRN could be the 
   last NSIS-aware entity before the Old and the Candidate path 
   diverge.

   As a consequence, the CCRN will be a node on the common trunk between 
   the Old path and the Candidate one.

   The discovery of the CCRN is realized by the GIST protocol during the 
   creation of the GIST state. In fact the protocol, during that phase 
   possesses all the information necessary for the mentioned discovery.

   If in a subnet there are many mobile terminals that are
   communicating with the same CN or with neighbouring CN, the CCNRs of
   different handovers could coincide in the same node. Therefore the
   node in managing different buffering would have more work load to
   handle with. It is possible to introduce more complex algorithm for
   choosing other CCRNs. This algorithm must take in account the node
   position and the presence of bufferization already in act.

   Future versions will consider detailed description of the two 
   algorithms.

5 The new buffering

   If the MN is the data flow receiver, it is necessary to have 
   buffering mechanisms in order to avoid the loss of packets sent to 
   MN during its handover.

   The buffered packets are sent to the MN across the NAR at the end of 
   the handover.

   This type of solutions has already been defined. For example,
   Perkins[7] propose to buffer at the PAR (in the document this node is 
   called Foreign Agent) but it guarantees only a minimal loss of packets 
   and not the right QoS during the sending of the buffered packets to the 
   MN.
   We have proposed the inclusion of buffering in the CCRN for various 
   reasons. 
   Above all because the CCRN is the closest node to the MN on the New 
   path in which buffering is possible. This means to reduce the total 
   time that the buffered packets use to reach the MN.

   The second motivation for making this choice regards the QoS. The 
   buffered packets, sent on the Local New path after the reservation 
   of resources are treated by the same QoS as the other packets from the 
   same flow.

   A CCRN starts to buffer packets as soon as it has been discovered.
 
   The CRN ends the bufferization of packets when it receives from the QNI 
   the RESERVE message.

   The other CCRNs stop the bufferization of packets and discard the 
   already buffered packets at the end of a timeout.
   If the MN is the data flow sender it is not necessary to effect any 
   bufferization.


6 Security Considerations

   For the moment we haven?t taken into account the security problem.
