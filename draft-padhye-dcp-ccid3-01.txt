1.  Introduction

    This document contains the profile for Congestion Control Identifier
    3, TCP-friendly rate control (TFRC), in the Datagram Control
    Protocol (DCP). DCP uses Congestion Control Identifiers, or CCIDs,
    to specify the congestion control mechanism in use on a half-
    connection. (A half-connection might consist of data packets sent
    from DCP A to DCP B, plus acknowledgments sent from DCP B to DCP A.
    DCP A is the sending DCP, and DCP B the acknowledging DCP, for this
    half-connection.)

    TFRC is a receiver-based congestion control mechanism that provides
    a TCP-friendly send rate, while minimizing abrupt rate changes [1].

    The basic TFRC protocol is as follows. The sender sends a stream of
    data packets to the receiver at some rate. The receiver sends a
    feedback packet to the sender once every round-trip time. Based on
    the information contained in the feedback packets, the sender
    adjusts its sending rate in accordance with the TCP throughput
    equation [2], to maintain TCP-friendliness. If no feedback is
    received from the receiver in two round-trip times, the sender
    halves its sending rate.

    The values of the round-trip time (RTT), the loss event rate (p) and
    the base timeout value T_0 are needed to calculate the send rate
    using the TCP throughput equation. In the TFRC protocol, the sender
    is responsible for calculating the values of RTT and T_0, while the
    receiver is responsible for calculating the value of p.

1.1.  Usage Scenario

    TFRC is intended to provide congestion control for the flow of data
    packets from the server to the client for applications that do not
    require fully reliable data transmission.


1.2.  Example Half-Connection

    This example, taken from the main DCP draft, is of a half-connection
    using TFRC Congestion Control specified by CCID 3.  The "sender" is
    the HC-Sender, and the "receiver" is the HC-Receiver.

    1   The sender sends DCP-Data packets, where the number of packets
        sent is governed by an allowed transmit rate, as specified in
        [1]. Each DCP-Data packet has a sequence number, and includes an
        Acknowledgment Number that is the sequence number of the most
        recent acknowledgment packet received from the receiver.  Each
        DCP-Data packet also contains a timestamp, the sender's estimate



Padhye/Floyd/Kohler                               Section 1.2.  [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT              Expires: May 2002              November 2001


        of the round-trip time, and the current sending rate.

        One or more of these data packets are DCP-DataAck packets
        acknowledging the data packet from the receiver, but for
        simplicity we will not discuss the half-connection of data from
        the receiver to the sender in this example.

    2   The receiver sends DCP-Ack packets at least once per round-trip
        time acknowledging the data packets, or as indicated by the TFRC
        specification [1]. Each DCP-Ack packet uses a sequence number
        and identifies the most recent packet received from the sender.
        Each DCP-Ack packet includes feedback about the loss event rate
        calculated by the receiver, as specified below.

    3   The sender continues sending DCP-Data packets as controlled by
        the allowed transmit rate.  Upon receiving DCP-Ack packets, the
        sender updates its allowed transmit rate as specified in [1].

    4   The sender estimates round-trip times and calculates a TimeOut
        (TO) value as specified in [1].

    5   If the use of ECN has been negotiated, each DCP-Data, DCP-
        DataAck, and DCP-Ack packet is sent as ECN-Capable, with either
        the ECT(0) or the ECT(1) codepoint set. The use of the ECN Nonce
        with TFRC is described below.


2.  Connection Establishment

    The connection is initiated by the client using mechanisms described
    in the DCP specification [3]. The client and the server MAY
    negotiate the use of ACK Vector option.  Both the server and the
    client MUST support the timestamp option. The ACK vector option and
    the timestamp option are described in [3].

3.  Congestion Control on Data Packets

    The sender sends DCP-Data packets to the receiver at the rate
    specified by the TCP throughput equation [2].

    Each DCP-Data packet has a sequence number, and an acknowledgment
    number that is the sequence number of the most recent acknowledgment
    packet received from the receiver. Each data packet contains the
    following options:

        1. Timestamp option, as described in [3].





Padhye/Floyd/Kohler                                 Section 3.  [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT              Expires: May 2002              November 2001


        2. An option specifying the sender's estimate of the round-trip
        time.

        3. An option specifying the current sending rate.

    The format of options 2 and 3 is described below.

    After each feedback packet is received from the receiver, the sender
    updates values of RTT, T_0 and the sending rate using procedures
    specified in [1].

    If no feedback packet is received from the receiver, the sending
    rate is halved.  However, the sending rate is never reduced below
    one packet per 64 seconds. See [1] for more details.


4.  Acknowledgments

    The receiver sends DCP-Ack packets to the sender once per round-trip
    time, or more frequently. This rate is determined by details of the
    TFRC protocol, as specified in [1].

    The acknowledgment number in the DCP-Ack packet acknowledges the
    most recent packet received from the sender. Each Ack packet from
    the receiver includes the following options:

        1. The echo timestamp option described in [3].

        2. An option specifying the loss event rate (p) calculated by
        the receiver as described in [1].

        3. An option specifying the rate at which the receiver received
        data since the last DCP-Ack was sent.

    The format of options 2 and 3 is described below.


4.1.  Congestion Control on Acknowledgments

    The rate and timing for generating acknowledgments is determined by
    the TFRC algorithm [1].

4.2.  Quiescence

    This section refers to quiescence in the DCP sense (see section 6.1
    of [3]): How does a CCID 3 receiver determine that the corresponding
    sender is not sending any data?




Padhye/Floyd/Kohler                               Section 4.2.  [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT              Expires: May 2002              November 2001


    The receiver detects that the sender has gone quiescent after two
    round-trip times have passed without receiving any additional data.
    Since ACKs are not required to be reliable, the receiver needs to do
    nothing special in this case, unlike CCID 2 [5].

4.3.  Acknowledgments of Acknowledgments

    Acknowledgments in TFRC are entirely unreliable -- TFRC works even
    if every acknowledgment is dropped -- and it is never necessary for
    the sender to acknowledge an acknowledgment.

5.  Explicit Congestion Notification

    ECN [6] MAY be used with CCID 3.  If ECN is used, then the ECN Nonce
    will automatically be used for the data packets, following the
    specification for the ECN Nonce [4] for TCP.  For the data sub-flow,
    the sender sets either the ECT[0] or ECT[1] codepoint on DCP-Data
    packets.  If the ACK vector option is being used, the ECN-NONCE
    information is returned via the ACK vector. Otherwise, the
    information about the ECN-NONCE is returned by the receiver using
    the ECN-NONCE option described below. The receiver MUST return this
    option if ECN is being used, and if it is reporting a lower packet
    loss rate than the one it reported in the previous acknowledgment.


6.  Relevant Options and Features


6.1.  RTT Option


    +--------+--------+----...-----+
    |10000000|00000100| RTT Value  |
    +--------+--------+----...-----+
     Type=128   Len=4    2 bytes

    This option is set by the data sender on all data packets. The first
    byte gives the option type and the second gives the option length.
    The last two bytes indicate sender's estimation of round-trip time
    in whole milliseconds.


6.2.  Send Rate Option

INTERNET-DRAFT              Expires: May 2002              November 2001


    +--------+--------+----...-----+
    |10000001|00000110| Send rate  |
    +--------+--------+----...-----+
     Type=129   Len=6    4 bytes

    This option is set by the data sender on all data packets. The first
    byte gives the option type and the second gives the option length.
    The last four bytes indicate the current sending rate in bits per
    second.


6.3.  Loss Event Rate Option



    +--------+--------+----...-----+
    |11000000|00000110| Loss rate  |
    +--------+--------+----...-----+
     Type=192   Len=6    4 bytes

    This option is set by the data receiver on all acknowledgment
    packets.  The first byte gives the option type and the second gives
    the option length.  The last four bytes indicate the inverse of the
    loss event rate, rounded UP, as calculated by the receiver.


6.4.  Receive Rate Option



    +--------+--------+----...-----+
    |10000001|00000110| Recv rate  |
    +--------+--------+----...-----+
     Type=129   Len=6    4 bytes

    This option is set by the data receiver on all acknowledgment
    packets.  The first byte gives the option type and the second gives
    the option length.  The last four bytes indicate the rate at which
    the receiver has received data since it last sent an acknowledgment,
    in bits per second.


6.5.  ECN NONCE Option








Padhye/Floyd/Kohler                               Section 6.5.  [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT              Expires: May 2002              November 2001


    +--------+--------+----...-----+----...-----+--------+
    |10000010|00001001| Left Edge | Right Edge  |X0000000|
    +--------+--------+----...-----+----...-----+--------+
     Type=130  Len=9     3 bytes      3 bytes     1 byte

    This option is set by the data receiver on any acknowledgment packet
    that reports a loss rate lower than the loss rate reported in the
    previous acknowledgment packet.  The first byte gives the option
    type and the second gives the option length.  The right edge (RE)
    and the left edge (LE) are sequence numbers of data packets, such
    that:

        - Let LastAck be the sequence number of the data packet
        acknowledged by the previous acknowledgment.

        - If (LastAck + 1) was a dropped or marked packet, then RE
        should be the highest non-dropped and non-marked packet before
        (LastAck + 1).

        - If (LastAck + 1) was not a dropped or marked packet, the RE
        should be the greatest sequence number such that all data
        packets between (LastAck + 1) and  RE, inclusive, were received
        and not ECN-marked.  Clearly (RE >= LastAck + 1).

        - LE should be the smallest sequence number such that all data
        packets between LE and RE, inclusive, were received and not ECN-
        marked.  Clearly (LE <= RE).

    The first bit of the final byte is the Nonce Echo.  It equals the
    base-2 modulus of the number of received ECN Nonce packets between
    LE and RE, both included.

    Note that the interval [LE, RE] would be the largest non-loss
    interval containing the first packet received since the last report,
    or, if that was a dropped packet, containing the run before this
    drop.  That is, [LE, RE] would continue to grow during non-drop and
    non-mark periods.


7.  Application Requirements

    As described in the TFRC specifications [1], this CCID should not be
    used by applications that change their sending rate by varying the
    packet size, rather than varying the rate at which packets are sent.

    As it is presently specified, this CCID should only be used by
    senders that are willing to trust the receiver to report the correct
    loss event rate.  If ECN is used, the ECN Nonce Option allows the

    sender to probabilistically verify the loss rate reported by the
    receiver. However, we have not specified such a verification
    procedure in this document.
