       Problem Statement for Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Networking
                draft-jeong-its-v2i-problem-statement-01

Abstract

   This document specifies the problem statement for IPv6-based vehicle-
   to-infrastructure networking.  Dedicated Short-Range Communications
   (DSRC) is standardized as IEEE 802.11p for the wireless media access
   in vehicular networks.  This document addresses the extension of IPv6
   as the network layer protocol in vehicular networks and is focused on
   the networking issues in one-hop communication between a Road-Side
   Unit (RSU) and vehicle.  The RSU is connected to the Internet and
   allows vehicles to have the Internet access if connected.  The major
   issues of including IPv6 in vehicular networks are neighbor discovery
   protocol, stateless address autoconfiguration, and DNS configuration
   for the Internet connectivity over DSRC.  Also, when a vehicle and an
   RSU have an internal network, respectively, the document discusses
   the issues of the internetworking between the vehicle's internal
   network and the RSU's internal network, such as prefix discovery,
   prefix exchange, and service discovery.

Internet-Draft            V2I Problem Statement                July 2016


1.  Introduction

   Recently, Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET) have been focusing on
   intelligent services in road networks, such as driving safety,
   efficient driving, and entertainment.  For this VANET, Dedicated
   Short-Range Communications (DSRC) [DSRC-WAVE] has been standardized
   as IEEE 802.11p [IEEE-802.11p], which is an extension of IEEE 802.11a
   [IEEE-802.11a] with a consideration of the vehicular network's
   characteristics such as a vehicle's velocity and collision avoidance.

   Now the deployment of VANET is demanded into real road environments
   along with the popularity of smart devices (e.g., smartphone and
   tablet).  Many automobile vendors (e.g., Benz, BMW, Ford, Honda, and
   Toyota) started to consider automobiles as computers instead of
   mechanical machines since many current vehicles are operating with
   many sensors and software.  Also, Google made a great advancement in
   self-driving vehicles with many special software modules and hardware
   devices to support computer-vision-based object recognition, machine-
   learning-based decision-making, and GPS navigation.

   With this trend, vehicular networking has been researched to enable
   vehicles to communicate with other vehicles and infrastructure nodes
   in the Internet by using TCP/IP technologies [ID-VN-Survey], such as
   IP address autoconfiguration, routing, handover, and mobility
   management.  IPv6 [RFC2460] is suitable for vehicular networks since
   the protocol has abundant address space, autoconfiguration features,
   and protocol extension ability through extension headers.

   This document specifies the problem statement of IPv6-based vehicle-
   to-infrastructure (V2I) networking, such as IPv6 addressing
   [RFC4291], neighbor discovery [RFC4861], address autoconfiguration
   [RFC4862], and DNS naming service [RFC6106][RFC3646][ID-DNSNA].  This
   document also specifies the problem statement of the internetworking
   between a vehicle's internal network and an RSU's internal network,
   such as prefix discovery, prefix exchange, and service discovery, in
   the case where the vehicle and the RSU have their own internal
   network.  In addition, the document analyzes the characteristics of
   vehicular networks to consider the design of V2I networking.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology described in [RFC4861] and
   [RFC4862].  In addition, four new terms are defined below:

   o  Road-Side Unit (RSU): A node that has a Dedicated Short-Range
      Communications (DSRC) device for wireless communications with the
      vehicles and is connected to the Internet.  Every RSU is usually
      deployed at an intersection so that it can provide vehicles with
      the Internet connectivity.

   o  Vehicle: A node that has the DSRC device for wireless
      communications with vehicles and RSUs.  Every vehicle may also
      have a GPS-navigation system for efficient driving.

   o  Traffic Control Center (TCC): A node that maintains road
      infrastructure information (e.g., RSUs and traffic signals),
      vehicular traffic statistics (e.g., average vehicle speed and
      vehicle inter-arrival time per road segment), and vehicle
      information (e.g., a vehicle's identifier, position, direction,
      speed, and trajectory).  TCC is included in a vehicular cloud for
      vehicular networks.

4.  Overview

   This document specifies the problem statement of vehicle-to-
   infrastructure (V2I) networking based on IPv6.  The main focus is
   one-hop networking between a vehicle and an RSU or between vehicles
   via an RSU.  However, this document does not address multi-hop
   networking scenarios of vehicles and RSUs.  Also, the problems focus
   on the network layer (i.e., IPv6 protocol stack) rather than the
   media access control (MAC) layer and the transport layer (e.g., TCP,
   UDP, and SCTP).

   Figure 1 shows the network configuration for V2I networking in a road
   network.  The two RSUs (RSU1 and RSU2) are deployed in the road
   network and are connected to the Vehicular Cloud through the
   Internet.  The TCC is connected to the Vehicular Cloud and the two
   vehicles (Vehicle1 and Vehicle2) are wirelessly connected to RSU1,
   and the last vehicle (Vehicle3) is wirelessly connected to RSU2.
   Vehicle1 can communicate with Vehicle2 via RSU1.  Vehicle1 can
   communicate with Vehicle3 via RSU1 and RSU2.

          Figure 1: The Network Configuration for V2I Networking

   Figure 2 shows internetworking between the vehicle's moving network
   and the RSU's fixed network.  There exists an internal network
   (Moving Network1), which is located inside Vehicle1.  Vehicle1 has
   the DNS Server (RDNSS1), the two hosts (Host1 and Host2), and the two
   routers (Router1 and Router2).  The internal network (Fixed Network1)
   is located inside RSU1.  RSU1 has the DNS Server (RDNSS2), one host
   (Host3), the two routers (Router3 and Router4), and the collection of
   servers (Server1 to ServerN) for various services in the road
   networks, such as the emergency notification and navigation.
   Vehicle1's Router1 and RSU1's Router3 use 2001:DB8:1:1::/64 for an
   external link (e.g., DSRC) for I2V networking.

   This document addresses the internetworking between the vehicle's
   moving network and the RSU's fixed network in Figure 2 and the
   required enhancement of IPv6 protocol suite for the V2I networking
   service.

5.  Internetworking between the Vehicle and RSU Networks

   This section discusses the internetworking between the vehicle's
   moving network and the RSU's fixed network.  As shown in Figure 2, it
   is assumed that the prefix assignment for each subnet inside the
   vehicle's mobile network and the RSU's fixed network through a prefix
   delegation protocol.  Problems are a prefix discovery and prefix
   exchange.  The prefix discovery is defined as how routers in a moving
   network discover the prefixes of the subnets in the moving network,
   as shown in Figure 2.  The prefix exchange is defined as how a
   vehicle and an RSU exchange their prefixes with each other.  Once
   these prefix discovery and prefix exchange are established, the
   unicast of packets should be supported between the vehicle's moving
   network and the RSU's fixed network.  Also, the DNS naming service
   should be supported for the DNS name resolution for a host or server
   in either the vehicle's moving network or the RSU's fixed network.

6.  IPv6 Addressing

   This section discusses IP addressing for V2I networking.  There are
   two policies for IPv6 addressing in vehicular networks.  The one
   policy is to use unique local IPv6 unicast addresses (ULAs) for
   vehicular networks [RFC4193].  The other policy is to use global IPv6
   addresses for the interoperability with the Internet [RFC4291].  The
   former approach is usually used by Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) for
   a separate multi-link subnet.  This approach can support the
   emergency notification service and navigation service in road
   networks.  However, for general Internet services (e.g., email
   access, web surfing and entertainment services), the latter approach
   is required.

   For the global IP addresses, there are two policies, which are a
   multi-link subnet approach for multiple RSUs and a single subnet
   approach per RSU.  In the multi-link subnet approach, which is
   similar to ULA for MANET, RSUs play a role of L2 switches and the
   router interconnected with the RSUs is required.  The router
   maintains the location of each vehicle belonging to an RSU for L2
   switching.  In the single subnet approach per RSU, which is similar
   to the legacy subnet in the Internet, RSUs play a role of L3 router.

7.  Neighbor Discovery

   The Neighbor Discovery (ND) is a core part of IPv6 protocol suite
   [RFC4861].  This section discusses the extension of ND for V2I
   networking.  The vehicles are moving fast within the communication
   coverage of an RSU.  The external link between the vehicle and the
   RSU can be used for V2I networking, as shown in Figure 2.

   ND time-related parameters such as router lifetime and Neighbor
   Advertisement (NA) interval should be adjusted for high-speed
   vehicles and vehicle density.  As vehicles move faster, the NA
   interval should decrease for the NA messages to reach the neighboring
   vehicles promptly.  Also, as vehicle density is higher, the NA
   interval should increase for the NA messages to collide with other NA
   messages with lower collision probability.

8.  IP Address Autoconfiguration

   This section discusses the IP address autoconfiguration for V2I
   networking.  For the IP address autoconfiguration, the high-speed
   vehicles should also be considered.  The legacy IPv6 stateless
   address autoconfiguration [RFC4862], as shown in Figure 1, may not
   perform well because vehicles can pass through the communication
   coverage of the RSU before the address autoconfiguration with the
   Router Advertisement and Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)



Jeong & Oh              Expires January 19, 2017                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            V2I Problem Statement                July 2016


   procedures.

   To mitigate the impact of vehicle speed on the address configuration,
   RSU can perform IP address autoconfiguration includig the DAD
   proactively for the sake of the vehicles as an ND proxy.  If vehicles
   periodically report their mobility information (e.g., position,
   trajectory, speed, and direction) to TCC, TCC can coordinate RSUs
   under its control for the proactive IP address configuration of the
   vehicles with the mobility information of the vehicles.  DHCPv6 (or
   Stateless DHCPv6) can be used for the IP address autoconfiguration
   [RFC3315][RFC3736].

   In the case of a single subnet per RSU, the delay to change IPv6
   address through DHCPv6 procedure is not suitable since vehicles move
   fast.  Some modifications are required for the high-speed vehicles
   that quickly crosses the communication coverages of multiple RSUs.
   Some modifications are required for both stateless address
   autoconfiguration and DHCPv6.

9.  DNS Naming Service

   This section discusses a DNS naming service for V2I networking.  The
   DNS naming service can consist of the DNS name resolution and DNS
   name autoconfiguration.

   The DNS name resolution translates a DNS name into the corresponding
   IPv6 address through a recursive DNS server (RDNSS) within the
   vehicle's moving network and DNS servers in the Internet
   [RFC1034][RFC1035], which are distributed in the world.  The RDNSSes
   can be advertised by RA DNS Option or DHCP DNS Option into the
   subnets within the vehicle's moving network.

   The DNS name autoconfiguration makes a unique DNS name for hosts
   within a vehicle's moving network and registers it into a DNS server
   within the vehicle's moving network [ID-DNSNA].  With Vehicle
   Identification Number (VIN), a unique DNS suffix can be constructed
   as a DNS domain for the vehicle's moving network.  Each host can
   generate its DNS name and register it into the local RDNSS in the
   vehicle's moving network.

10.  IP Mobility Management

   This section discusses an IP mobility support in V2I networking.  In
   a single subnet per RSU, vehicles keep crossing the communication
   coverages of adjacent RSUs.  During this crossing, TCP/UDP sessions
   can be maintained through IP mobility support, such as Mobile IPv6
   (MIPv6) [RFC6275], Proxy MIPv6 [RFC5213][RFC5949], and Distributed
   Mobility Management (DMM) [RFC7333][RFC7429].  Since vehicles move

Internet-Draft            V2I Problem Statement                July 2016


   fast along roadways, this high speed should be considered for a
   parameter configuration in the IP mobility management.  With the
   periodic reports of the mobility information from the vehicles, TCC
   can coordinate RSUs and other network compoments under its control
   for the proactive mobility management of the vehicles along the
   movement of the vehicles.

   To support the mobility of a vehicle's moving network, Network
   Mobility Basic Support Protocol (NEMO) can be used [RFC3963].  Like
   Mobile IPv6, the high speed of vehicles should be considered for a
   parameter configuration in NEMO.

11.  Service Discovery

   Vehicles need to discover services (e.g., road condition
   notification, navigation service, and infotainment) provided by
   infrastructure nodes in a fixed network via RSU, as shown in
   Figure 2.  During the passing of an intersection or road segment with
   an RSU, vehicles should perform this service discovery quickly.

   Since with the existing service discovery protocols, such as DNS-
   based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) [RFC6763] and Multicast DNS (mDNS)
   [RFC6762], the service discovery will be performed with message
   exchanges, the discovery delay may hinder the prompt service usage of
   the vehicles from the fixed network via RSU.  One feasible approach
   is a piggyback service discovery during the prefix exchange of
   network prefixes for the networking between a vehicle's moving
   network and an RSU's fixed network.  That is, the message of the
   prefix exchange can include service information, such as each
   service's IP address, transport layer protocol, and port number.

12.  Security Considerations

   The security and privacy are very important in secure vehicular
   networks for V2I networking.  Only valid vehicles should be allowed
   to use V2I networking in vehicular networks.  VIN and a user
   certificate along with in-vehicle device's identifier generation can
   be used to authenticate a vehicle and the user through a road
   infrastructure node, such as an RSU connected to an authentication
   server in TCC.  Also, TLS certificates can be used for secure vehicle
   communications.

   A security scheme providing authentication and access control should
   be provided in vehicular networks [VN-Security].  With this scheme,
   the secuirty and privacy can be supported for safe and reliable data
   services in vehicular networks.
