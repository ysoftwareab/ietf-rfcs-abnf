   Intelligent access selection, taking into account link layer
   attributes, requires the delivery of a variety of different
   information types to the terminal from different sources within the
   network.  The protocol requirements for this signalling have both
   transport and security issues that must be considered.  The
   signalling must not be constrained to specific link types, so there
   is at least a common component to the signalling problem which is
   within the scope of the IETF.  This draft presents a problem
   statement for this core problem.

1.  Introduction

   This Internet Draft provides a problem statement for the exchange of
   information to support handover in heterogeneous link environments.
   This mobility support service allows more sophisticated handover
   operations by making available information about network
   characteristics, neighbouring networks and associated
   characteristics, indications that a handover should take place, and
   suggestions for suitable target networks to which to handover.

   There are two key attributes to the handover support service problem:

   1.  The Information Exchange itself: this includes the information
       elements that describe the information, and any signalling
       exchanges that are required to support the generation of these
       Information Elements.

   2.  The Underlying Transport: this supports the Information Exchange
       between devices in the network.  The requirements on this
       transfer mechanism include transport issues, because of the
       volume of data to be sent, as well as security issues, as the
       signalling may cross administrative boundaries and is
       interdependent with AAA aspects.

   The Information Exchange aspect of the problem is an area that is
   currently under discussion within IEEE 802.21, but it is felt that
   the definition of the underlying transport that supports transfer of
   this information over IP is an aspect that is best addressed within
   the IETF.

   This draft has been motivated by on-going work within IEEE 802.21,
   but the following description intentionally describes the problem
   from a more general perspective.  This document represents the views
   of the authors, and does not represent the official view of IEEE
   802.21.

   The structure of this document is as follows.  Section 2 provides a
   simple model for the entities involved in the signalling and their
   possible relationships.  Section 3 describes a decomposition of the
   signalling problem into service specific parts and a generic
   transport part.  Section 4 describes more detailed requirements for
   the transport component.  Section 5 provides security considerations,
   and Section 6 summarises the conclusions and open issues.


2.  Entities

   The following section provides an overview of the network entities



Hepworth, et al.         Expires April 20, 2006                 [Page 3]

   that are expected to be involved in the signalling exchanges to
   support the handover operation.  The following abbreviations are used
   in this section:

   o  MN: mobile node

   o  NN: network node, intended to represent some device in the network
      (the location of the node e.g. in the access network, home network
      is not specified, and for the moment it is assumed that they can
      reside anywhere).

   o  EP: endpoint, intended to represent the terminating endpoints of
      the transport protocol used to support the signalling exchanges
      between nodes.

   There are three basic deployment scenarios:

   o  End-to-end signalling and transport over IP

      In this case, the end-to-end signalling used to exchange the
      handover information elements (the Information Exchange) runs end-
      to-end between MN and NN.  The underlying transport is also end-
      to-end

           +------+                              +------+
           |  MN  |                              |  NN  |
           | (EP) |                              | (EP) |
           +------+                              +------+

               \------------------------------------/

      Figure 1: End-to-end Signalling and Transport

   o  End-to-end signalling and partial transport over IP

      As before, the Information Exchange runs end-to-end between the MN
      and the second NN.  However, in this scenario, some other
      transport means is used from the MN to the first NN, and the
      transport over IP is used only between NNs.  This is analogous to
      the use of EAP end-to-end between Supplicant and Authentication
      Server, with a upper-layer multihop protocol such as RADIUS used
      as a backhaul transport protocol between an Access Point and the
      Authentication Server.

   o  End-to-end signalling with a proxy

      In the final case, a number of proxies are inserted along the path
      between the two transport endpoints.  The use of proxies is
      possible in both cases 1 and 2 above, but distinguished here as
      there may be operations performed on the end-to-end Information
      Exchange.

                \---------------/     \----------------/

      Figure 3: Proxy Operation

   As well as these basic scenarios, it is possible to consider the use
   of transport layer relays (cf. similar functionality in Diameter
   [3]).  This can be seen as a generalisation of scenario 2.

   Note: while MN-to-MN signalling exchanges are theoretically possible,
   these are not currently being considered, and are out-of-scope.


3.  Solution Components

   Figure 4 shows a model where the Information Exchanges are
   implemented by a signalling protocol specific to a particular
   mobility service, and these are relayed over a generic transport
   layer (the Mobility Service Transport Layer).

   Figure 4: Handover Services over IP

   The Mobility Service Transport Layer provides certain functionality
   (outlined in Section 4) to the higher layer mobility services in
   order to support the exchange of information between communicating
   mobility service functions.  The transport layer effectively provides
   a container capability to mobility services, as well as any required
   discovery, transport and security operations required to provide
   communication.

   The Mobility Services themselves may also define certain protocol
   exchanges to support the exchange of service specific Information
   Elements.  It is likely that the responsibility for defining the
   contents and significance of the Information Elements is the
   responsibility of other standards bodies other that the IETF.
   Example mobility services include the Media Independent Information
   Service [1], and the Media Independent Command and Event Services
   [2].


4.  Requirements on the Mobility Service Transport Layer

   The following section outlines some of the general transport
   requirements that should be supported by the Mobility Service
   Transport Protocol.  Analysis within IEEE 802.21 has suggested that
   at least the following need to be taken into account:






Hepworth, et al.         Expires April 20, 2006                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               MIH Signalling                 October 2005


   Discovery: MNs need the ability to locate nodes that support
      particular mobility services in the network.  There are no
      assumptions about the location of these mobility services within
      the network, therefore the discovery mechanism needs to operate
      across administrative boundaries.  Issues such as speed of
      discovery, when discovery needs to take place, and the length of
      time over which the discovery information may remain valid all
      need to be considered.  Similar discovery requirements may apply
      to general NN discovery in the network.

   Information from a trusted source: The MN uses the Mobility Service
      information to make decisions about what steps to take next.  It
      is essential that there is some way to ensure that the information
      received is from a trustworthy source.  This includes cases where
      trusted proxies along the path have access to, and may modify,
      parts of the Mobility Service information.  This requirement has
      interactions with the AAA infrastructure for the purposes of
      authenticating and authorising the information exchange itself.

   Low latency: Some of the Mobility Services generate time sensitive
      information.  Therefore, there is a need to deliver the
      information over quite short timescales, and the required lifetime
      of a connection might be quite short lived.  For reliable
      delivery, short-lived connections could be set up as and when
      needed, although there is a connection setup latency associated
      with this approach.  Alternatively, a long-lived connection could
      be used, but this requires advanced warning of being needed and
      some way to maintain the state associated with the connection.  It
      also assumes that the relationships between devices supporting the
      mobility service are fairly stable.  Another alternative is
      connectionless operation, but this has interactions with other
      requirements such as reliable delivery.

   Reliability: Reliable delivery for some of the mobility services may
      be essential, but it is difficult to trade this off against the
      low latency requirement.  There are three possible approaches.  In
      the first case, all reliability functionality is placed in the
      transport, which requires the Mobility Service Transport Layer to
      support loss detection, re-transmission, failure detection and
      recovery.  Alternatively, the reliability can be built into
      Mobility Service itself, where timers are used by the service to
      determine whether a re-transmission over an unreliable transport
      is needed.  This is quite useful in cases where the information is
      time sensitive as it gives the mobility service a chance to update
      the information it sends.  Lastly, a hybrid approach could be
      adopted where the transport provides an indication of whether the
      delivery was successful or not to the Mobility Service, and it
      decides whether to re-transmit.  This still supports time



Hepworth, et al.         Expires April 20, 2006                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               MIH Signalling                 October 2005


      sensitive services, as the mobility service can choose to update
      the information it is sending.

   Congestion Control: A Mobility Service may wish to transfer large
      amounts of data, placing a requirement for congestion control in
      the transport.  There is an interaction between this requirement
      and that of the requirement for low latency since ways to deal
      with timely delivery of smaller asynchronous messages around the
      larger datagrams is required (mitigation of head of line blocking
      etc.).

   Secure delivery: The Mobility Service information must be delivered
      securely between trusted peers, where the transport may pass
      though untrusted intermediate nodes and networks.

   Multiplexing: The transport service needs to be able to support
      different mobility services.  This may require multiplexing and
      the ability to manage multiple discovery operations and peering
      relationships in parallel.

   Multihoming: For some information services exchanged with the MN,
      there is a possibility that the request and response messages can
      be carried over two different links e.g. a handover command
      request is on the current link while the response could be
      delivered on the new link.  Depending on the IP mobility
      mechanism, there is some impact on the transport option for the
      mobility information services.  This may potentially have some
      associated latency and security issues, for example, if the
      transport is over IP there is some transparency but Mobile IP may
      introduce additional delay and both TCP and UDP must use the
      permanent address of the MN.

   In addition to the above, it may be necessary for the transport to
   support multiple applications (or modes of operation) to support the
   particular requirements of the Information Exchange being carried out
   between nodes.  This may require the ability to multiplex multiple
   information exchanges into a single transport exchange.

   Further information about transport requirements related to specific
   Mobility Services can be found in [1] and [2].


5.  Security Considerations

   Network supported mobility services aim at improving decision making
   and management of dynamically connected hosts.  The control and
   maintenance of mobile nodes becomes challenging where authentication
   and authorization credentials used to access a network are



Hepworth, et al.         Expires April 20, 2006                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               MIH Signalling                 October 2005


   unavailable for the purpose of bootstrapping a security association
   for handover services.

   Information Services may not require authorization of the client, but
   both event and command services must authenticate message sources,
   particularly if they are mobile.  Network side service entities will
   typically need to provide proof of authority to serve visiting
   devices.  Where signalling or radio operations can result from
   received messages, significant disruption may result from processing
   bogus or modified messages.  The effect of processing bogus messages
   depends largely upon the content of the message payload, which is
   handled by the handover services application.  Regardless of the
   variation in effect, message delivery mechanisms need to provide
   protection against tampering, and spoofing.

   Sensitive and identifying information about a mobile device may be
   exchanged during handover service message exchange.  Since handover
   decisions are to be made based upon message exchanges, it may be
   possible to trace a user's movement between cells, or predict future
   movements, by inspecting handover service messages.  In order to
   prevent such tracking, message confidentiality should be available.
   This is particularly important since many mobile devices are
   associated with only one user, as divulgence of such information may
   violate the user's privacy.  Additionally, identifying information
   may be exchanged during security association construction.  As this
   information may be used to trace users across cell boundaries,
   identity protection should be available if possible, when
   establishing SAs.

   Finally, the network nodes themselves will potentially be subject to
   denial of service attacks from MNs and these problems will be
   exacerbated if operation of the mobility service protocols imposes a
   heavy computational load on the NNs.  The overall design has to
   consider at what stage (e.g. discovery, transport layer
   establishment, service specific protocol exchange) denial of service
   prevention or mitigation should be built in.


6.  Conclusions and Open Issues

   This Internet draft outlined a broad problem statement for the
   signalling of information elements across a network to support media
   independent handover services.  In order to enable this type of
   signalling service, a need for a generic transport solution with
   certain transport and security properties was outlined.  Whilst the
   motivation for considering this problem has come form work within
   IEEE 802.21, a desirable goal is to ensure that solutions to this
   problem are applicable to a wider range of mobility services.

Internet-Draft               MIH Signalling                 October 2005


   One important open issue is the question of how much Mobility Service
   specific functionality (with respect to the structure shown in [])
   should be seen as part of the common problem within IETF scope.  One
   option is that the problem scope is limited strictly to message
   transport requirements, the other extreme is that the full mobility
   service protocols should be defined.  An intermediate stage would be
   to consider message sequences and use cases for different mobility
   services but leave the details of Information Elements by other
   bodies, but potentially including IETF working groups.

   It would be valuable to establish realistic performance goals for the
   solution to this common problem (i.e. transport and security aspects)
   using experience from previous IETF work in this area and knowledge
   about feasible deployment scenarios.  This information could then be
   used as an input to other standards bodies in assisting them to
   design mobility services with feasible performance requirements.

   Much of the functionality required for this problem is available from
   existing IETF protocols or combination thereof.  This document takes
   no position on whether an existing protocol can be adapted for the
   solution or whether new protocol development is required.  In either
   case, we believe that the appropriate skills for development of
   protocols in this area lies in the IETF.
