Abstract

   This document describes the Sun vendor-specific Diameter Ping
   extension.  The Diameter Ping is a very useful troubleshooting tool,
   allowing a Diameter node to determine whether reachability to a
   domain is possible.

1.0  Introduction

   This document describes the Sun vendor-specific Diameter Ping
   extension.  The Diameter Ping is a very useful troubleshooting tool,
   allowing a Diameter node to determine whether reachability to a
   domain is possible.

   The Extension number for this draft is 555. Diameter nodes conforming
   to this specification MUST include an Extension-Id AVP with a value
   of 555 in the Device-Reboot-Ind Command [1].


1.1  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST", "MUST NOT",
   "optional", "recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be
   interpreted as described in [2].


2.0  Command-Code Values

   This section defines Command-Code [1] values that MUST be supported
   by all Diameter implementations conforming to this specification.
   The following Command Codes are defined in this specification:

      Command-Name             Abbrev.    Code       Reference
      --------------------------------------------------------
      Sun-Ping-Request          SDP       511/42        2.1
      Sun-Ping-Answer           SDA       512/42        2.2

2.1  Sun-Ping-Request (SDP)

   The Sun-Ping-Request (SDP), indicated by the Command-Code field set
   to 511, and Vendor Id set to 32, MAY be sent by a Diameter client to
   any Diameter server to request reachability to a particular domain.
   The routing procedures described in [1] will ensure that the request
   is sent to a Diameter server in the requested domain.

   Message Format

      <Sun-Ping-Request>  ::= < Diameter Header: 511, vid: 42 >
                              { Origin-FQDN }
                              { Origin-Realm }
                              { Destination-Realm }
                              { Session-Id }
                              { User-Name }
                              [ Destination-FQDN ]
                            * [ Proxy-Info ]
                            * [ Route-Record ]
                            * [ AVP ]


2.2  Sun-Ping-Answer (SPA)

   The Sun-Ping-Answer (SPA), indicated by the Command-Code field set to
   512, and Vendor Id set to 32, is sent as a response to the Sun-Ping-
   Request message.

   Message Format

      <Sun-Ping-Answer>  ::= < Diameter Header: 512 vid: 42 >
                             { Origin-FQDN }
                             { Origin-Realm }
                             { Result-Code }
                             { Session-Id }
                             { User-Name }
                             [ Destination-FQDN ]
                           * [ Proxy-Info ]
                           * [ Route-Record ]
                           * [ AVP ]


3.0  IANA Considerations

   The command codes defined in Section 2.0 are vendor-specific
   Commands, which is privately managed, and does not falls within the
   the Command-Code address space defined in [1].


4.0  Security Considerations

   This Diameter extension assumes that messages are secured either
   through a hop-by-hop authentication mechanism, as described in [1],
   or using a strong authentication mechanism as defined in [3].
