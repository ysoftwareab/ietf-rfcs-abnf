Guide for application developers on session continuity by using MIF API
             draft-deng-mif-api-session-continuity-guide-00

Abstract

   Today most smart terminals are equiped with multiple interfaces such
   as 3G/LTE and Wifi, users experience some application broken during
   switching interfaces.  MIF API draft [I-D.ietf-mif-api-extension] has
   specified some API to announce interface on/off information to the
   applications.  Once the application received those information, it
   can re-connect to the servers which could improve session continuity
   experience in some extent.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft         MIF API Session Continuity              July 2012


1.  Introduction

   Most smart terminals today have both Wifi and 3G/LTE interfaces, and
   operators may charge differently for different connection which lead
   to user sometime switching their interface when the terminals are in
   the different network coverage.  When the user switched from 3G/LTE
   to wifi or vice versa, the applications sitting in the terminal are
   not awared of this change may experience of broken.

   MIF API draft [I-D.ietf-mif-api-extension] has specified an API
   interface, there are some API related to interface status
   information. if the application developers are awared of those
   information, then they can develop the application to follow those
   behavior. this document try to write a guidance about how the
   application developer use MIF API information to guarantee the
   application session continuity by changing the source address.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


5.  Security Considerations

   Sometime when the Wifi interface is up, even it has got an IP
   address, default gateway, and DNS server address, but it may not be
   connected the Internet because web portal hasn't been successfully
   authenticated.  In this case, even applciation would like to use
   source address from wifi to re-connect with the server, it may still
   fail.

   Some applications may rely on the source address as the credentials,
   it may need to reestablish the new credential after the application
   switchs into a new source address.
