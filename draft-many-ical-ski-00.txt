Abstract 
    
   This Memo defines the SKiCal format. 
    
   SKiCal is a machine readable format for describing public events and 
   other phenomena in time and space. SKiCal is based on and extends 
   the iCalendar format as defined by RFC-2445, Internet Calendaring 
   and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar) [3]. SKiCal 
   objects are basically iCalendar objects containing VEVENT components 
   with the additions of experimental properties, constructed according 
   to the specification in RFC-2445 section 4.8.8.1. 
    
   SKiCal is an attempt to adapt iCalendar to the common needs of many 
   organizers of public events (e.g. culture, sports, tourist 
   attractions), and potential attendees of those events. The format 
   has been developed through the combined effort of several Swedish 
   national agencies.

1.   Reading instructions and conventions 
   
   This document is intended to be read alongside RFC-2445 [3]. The 
   same basic grammar and formatting conventions apply. 
    
   The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of RFC-2234 [4]. 
   Readers intending on implementing the format defined in this memo 
   should be familiar with this notation in order to properly interpret 
   the specifications of this memo. Also, they MUST be familiar with 
   the iCalendar core object specification (RFC-2445 [3]). 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2]. 
    
   The word "event" is to be widely interpreted as a resource existing 
   in time and space. For example a museum, which is indeed a 
   persistent resource, but which can be described in terms of time, 
   location and subject category. Another example is a TV show. It has 
   no traditional location, but it can be described by a SKiCal object 
   as an event. 
    
2       SKiCal specific property parameters 
 
   The following are general SKiCal property parameters not previously 
   defined by RFC-2445: 
    
2.1    Person's Role 
    
   Parameter Name: DIPROLE 
    
   Purpose: To clarify the role of a person(s) in the event.  
    
     Note: The abbreviation DIP stands for "by Description Identifiable 
     Person" which basically means person. See [9] for discussion. 
    
   Format Definition: The property parameter is defined by the 
   following notation: 
    
     personroleparam  = "DIPROLE" "=" 
                        ("PRESENT"   ; At the event 
                        / "REFERENCED" ; Not present at the event 
                        / "PERFORMER"  ; Appearing at the event  
                        / "CREATOR"    ; Not necessarily present   
    
   Description: This parameter can be specified on X-SKI-PERSONS 
   property. The parameter declares whether named persons will actually 
   be at the event, or referred to. 
                       draft-many-ical-ski-00.txt 

         
   Example: 
    
    X-SKI-PERSONS;DIPROLE=REFERENCED:Marilyn Monroe 
    X-SKI-PERSONS;DIPROLE=CREATOR:Beethoven, Ludwig van  
    
  2.2  Thing's Role 
    
   Parameter Name: DITROLE 
    
   Purpose: To clarify the role of a named thing(s) in the event.    
    
     Note: The abbreviation DIT stands for "by Description Identifiable 
     Thing" which basically means thing. See [9] for discussion. 
    
   Format Definition: The property parameter is defined by the 
   following notation: 
    
     thingroleparam  = "DITROLE" "=" 
                        ("PRESENT"   ; At the event 
                        / "REFERENCED" ; Not present at the event 
                                 
                        ; Default is PRESENT 
    
   Description: This parameter can be specified on X-SKI-THINGS 
   property. The parameter declares whether named things will actually 
   be at the event, or referred to.   
       
   Example: 
    
    X-SKI-THINGS;DITROLE=PRESENT:Car models of 2001 
 
 
3.        SKiCal specific component properties 

   The class of SKiCal objects is a superset of the class of iCalendar 
   objects. Therefore any component property which MAY appear in a 
   VEVENT iCalendar component is also allowed in a SKiCal object. In 
   addition, component properties with names beginning "X-SKI-" are 
   defined in this memo.  
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that publishers fetch the terms used as TEXT type  
   property values from authoritative lists of terms. Those publishers 
   who consequently use terms found in such lists will facilitate very 
   extensive automatic treatment of their information. For example, if 
   such a list is being translated into several languages, then it will 
   be possible to get accurate results when searching for events 
   described in languages other than that used in the query. 
    
   For reasons of clarity the properties self-describing the iCalendar 
   object are presented under the "MANAGEMENT" header (Calendar object 
   management), while properties describing the real life event are 
   presented under the interrogative headers; "WHAT", "WHEN", "WHERE", 
   "WHO", "WHY", "WHICH" and "WHOW". These headers, which we call the 
   WHA interrogatives, have no technical significance today.

3.1    WHAT properties 
 
   The following properties answer questions about the event such as 
   "What is it?" and "What is happening?". 
    
   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] that the SKiCal working group 
   considers related to WHAT are: 
    
   4.8.1.1 Attachment 
   4.8.1.2 Categories 
   4.8.1.5 Description 
   4.8.1.12 Summary 
 
   In addition to the properties named above as defined in RFC-2445, a 
   SKiCal object may include the following properties; 
       
3.1.1   Title 
    
   Property Name: X-SKI-TITLE 
    
   Purpose: This property specifies the title of the event described. 
    
   Value Type: TEXT.  
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard and language property parameters  
   can be specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: Public events often have titles associated with them.  
   The title may not always be a good SUMMARY of the event, but it is a 
   piece of information which the publisher of the event will expect to 
   be able to convey to the audience. It might also be a copyrighted 
   name that the publisher wishes to see included in the calendar 
   object. 
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
     x-ski-title = "X-SKI-TITLE" titleparam ":" text CRLF 
    
                        ; It is RECOMMENDED that the text value be  
                        ; chosen from a list, as described in section 4  
                        ; of this memo. 
    
     titleparam  = *( 
                   ; the following is optional, 
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once 
                   (";" languageparam ) / 
    
                   ; the following is optional,

                       ; chosen from a list, as described in section 4  
                       ; of this memo. 
    
     personsparam  = *( 
                       ; the following is optional,

                       draft-many-ical-ski-00.txt 

   Description: This property allows for the publisher of an event to 
   indicate that the event is part of another event, such as a festival 
   or a package of tourist attractions. This property resembles the 
   RELATED-TO;RELTYPE=parent property, but that relationship is 
   determined by a calendar user. 
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
     x-ski-partof = "X-SKI-PARTOF" partofparam ":" text CRLF 
    
     partofparam  = *( 
                   ; the following is optional, 
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once 
    
                   (";" languageparam ) / (";" cnparam ) /

                   ; and MAY occur more than once 
    
                   (";" xparam) 
                   ) 
    
   Example: The following are examples of this property: 
    
     X-SKI-PARTOF;CN=Vattenfestivalen:<19990401T080045Z-
   F192713@stoinfo.se>  
     X-SKI-PARTOF;CN=2004 Winter Olympics:<19991202@olympic.org> 
     X-SKI-PARTOF:<ev32987-a33498@calendar.com> 
    
3.1.6   Language used at the event 
    
   Property Name: X-SKI-EVENT-LANGUAGE  
    
   Purpose: This property specifies the language used at the event, 
   knowledge of which is needed in order to appreciate the event.  
    
   Value Type: TEXT.  
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: Language used at the event. For example, the main 
   language of a theatre play. If the event is being translated, the 
   information about what languages are being translated should be 
   published under RESOURCES. If one can appreciate the event without 
   knowledge of any specific language, this property should not be 
   specified. 
 
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
                       draft-many-ical-ski-00.txt 

     x-ski-event-language = "X-SKI-EVENT-LANGUAGE" ":" language CRLF 
    
     language = <Text identifying a language, as defined in  
                 RFC-1766 [5]> 
    
   Example: The following is an example of this property: 
     X-SKI-EVENT-LANGUAGE:en 
     X-SKI-EVENT-LANGUAGE:sv 
    
3.1.7   Orientation 
    
   Property Name: X-SKI-ORIENTATION  
    
   Purpose: This property can, without implying inclusion or exclusion 
   of calendar users, facilitate event searches. It can indicate that 
   an event has a specific target audience, or that it is somehow 
   related to a specific cause, faith, professional group, gender, 
   ethnic group etc.  
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
     x-ski-orientation = "X-SKI-ORIENTATION" orientparam ":"  
                           text CRLF 
                       ; It is RECOMMENDED that the text value be  
                       ; chosen from a list, as described in section 4

3.1.8   What URL 
    
   Property Name: WHURL 
    
                       draft-many-ical-ski-00.txt 

   Purpose: This property defines a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) 
   associated with the event the SKiCal object is describing. 
    
   Value Type: URI 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: This property may be used in a calendar component to 
   convey a location where a more dynamic rendition of the event 
   described by the calendar component can be found. This memo does not 
   attempt to standardize the form of the URI, nor the format of the 
   resource pointed to by the property value. If the URL property and 
   Content-Location MIME header are both specified, they MUST point to 
   the same resource. 
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
        whurl        = "WHURL" whurlparam ":" uri CRLF 
    
        whurlparam   = *(";" xparam) 
    
   Example: The following is an example of this property: 
    
        WHURL:http://www.medianet.org/ 
    
3.1.9        Event Unique Identifier 

   Property Name: EUID 
    
   Purpose: This property defines the persistent, globally unique 
   identifier for the Event. 
    
   Value Type: TEXT 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
 
   Description: The EUID itself MUST be a globally unique identifier. 
   The generator of the identifier MUST guarantee that the identifier 
   is unique. There are several algorithms that can be used to 
   accomplish this. The identifier is RECOMMENDED to be the identical 
   syntax to the [RFC-822] addr-spec. A good method to assure 
   uniqueness is to put the domain name or a domain literal IP address 
   of the host on which the identifier was created on the right hand 
   side of the "@", and on the left hand side, put a combination of the 
   current calendar date and time of day (i.e., formatted in as a DATE-
   TIME value) along with some other currently unique (perhaps 
   sequential) identifier available on the system (for example, a 
   process id number). Using a date/time value on the left hand side 
   and a domain name or domain literal on the right hand side makes it 
                       draft-many-ical-ski-00.txt 

   possible to guarantee uniqueness since no two hosts should be using 
   the same domain name or IP address at the same time. Though other 
   algorithms will work, it is RECOMMENDED that the right hand side 
   contain some domain identifier (either of the host itself or 
   otherwise) such that the generator of the message identifier can 
   guarantee the uniqueness of the left hand side within the scope of 
   that domain. 
    
     Note: This method is identical to that recommended for the 
     creation of UID's as described in RFC-2445, section 4.8.4.7. 
    
   This property is an important method for determining the definite, 
   authoritative and unique source of an event. We must separate the 
   management of calendar objects from the management of events. There 
   MUST be only one EUID for an event, though there MIGHT exist several 
   Calendar Objects, each with their own UID describing the exact same 
   event.   
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
        euid        = "EUID" euidparam ":" text CRLF 
    
        euidparam   = *(";" xparam) 
    
   Example: The following is an example of this property: 
    
        EUID:20021001T090045Z-4000F192713-0052@qwack.com 
 
3.2   WHEN properties  
    
   The following properties answer time and date related questions 
   about the event, such as "When does it happen?". 
    
   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] that the SKiCal working group 
   considers related to WHEN are: 
    
   4.8.2 Date and Time Component Properties 
   4.8.3 Time Zone Component Properties 
   4.8.5 Recurrence Component Properties 
 
   In addition to the properties named above as defined in RFC-2445, a 
   SKiCal object may include the following properties; 
     
    
3.2.1   Opening times 
    
   Property Name: X-SKI-OPENINGTIMES  
    
   Description: Opening times is currently under discussion in the 
   CalSch working group. There are arguments for including OPENINGTIMES 
   as a component property or a property parameter.  This could 
   necessitate some rule and syntax changes for; 4.8.5.1 Exception 
   Date/Times, 4.8.5.2 Exception Rule,4.8.5.3 Recurrence Date/Times, 
   4.8.5.4 Recurrence Rule. 
                       draft-many-ical-ski-00.txt 

 
   In brief we would like to see the following hierarchical syntax for 
   Opening times: 
   TERM 
        SEASONS 
                IDENTICAL DAYS 
                        TIME SLOT   
                                EXCEPTIONS 
    
   Where:  
   TERM(mandatory), expressed with DTSTART and DTEND, sets the limits 
   for the declaration of an event's opening times. Any dates and times 
   outside the limits of the TERM will be parsed as not-defined. 
    
   SEASONS(optional), expressed with DTSTART and DTEND, set the limits 
   for  periods of consecutive days, which are assumed to reoccur 
   during the TERM. It is assumed that seasons could be used at the 
   convenience of the publisher to define reoccurring sets of IDENTICAL 
   DAYS. 
    
   IDENTICAL DAYS(optional), are days made up of exactly identical TIME 
   SLOT schedules.  IDENTICAL DAYS are first declared with TIME SLOT 
   sets, given unique names and then related to days of the week (by-
   named day) or days of the month or days of the year or by Date. 
    
   TIME SLOTS(mandatory), define the start and stop times for: 
    
        OPEN and CLOSED times 
        qualified OPEN and CLOSED times 
        by free text named times, at the discretion of the publisher. 
    
   EXCEPTIONS(optional)  relate non-conforming dates to matching 
   IDENTICAL DAYS 
    
3.2.2   Scheduled times 
    
   Property Name: X-SKI-SCHEDULINGTIMES  
    
   Scheduling times is currently under discussion in the Calsch working 
   groups and will hopefully be classified as a new iCalendar property. 
    
3.2.3   Geo related natural times. 
      
   With the aid of geographic location, altitude and compass course 
   cross-referencing authoritative registries, there are capabilities 
   for including "Natural" time and date properties.  
      
   ex. Sunup, Sundown, High-tide and Low-tide, full moon and solar 
   eclipses etc, as well as Lunar calendar based events. 
 
3.2.4   Relative Times 
      
   Relative Time properties are times dependent upon the times for 
   other events. They cannot exist independently.  
      
                       draft-many-ical-ski-00.txt 

   Example: the bar at the opera always opens one hour before the 
   performance.  Can be declared by the bar tender, with out any 
   knowledge of the Opera Company's repertoire and schedule.     
    
3.3   WHICH properties  
 
   WHICH is used to signify a choice of venues, or media, a question 
   which transcends the semantic limits of WHERE. 
    
   The following property answers the question, "In which context does 
   the event occur?" 
    
   There is no property defined in RFC-2445 [3] that the SKiCal working 
   group considers related to WHICH. 
    
3.3.1   Venue 
    
   Property Name: X-SKI-VENUE  
    
   Purpose:  This property defines the "physical" room in which an 
   event takes place.    
    
   Value Type: TEXT.  
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: The venue parameter divides events into a number of 
   distinctly different groups, which is useful when there is a need to 
   quickly reduce the number of events in a selection. For example: 
   When searching for outdoor sports events to take part in, it will 
   help not having to browse through listings of all sports TV shows. 
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
     x-ski-venue = "X-SKI-VENUE" ":" venuetype CRLF 
    
     venuetype  =   
     "Internet"/ 
     "Radio"/ 
     "TV" / 
     "Outdoors"/ 
     "Indoors"/ 
     "Travel-transit" 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Example: The following is an example of this property: 
     X-SKI-VENUE:Outdoors 
    
                       draft-many-ical-ski-00.txt 

3.4   WHERE properties  
    
   The following properties answer questions about the event such as 
   "Where does it happen?" and "Where do I find the event?". 
    
   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] that the SKiCal working group 
   considers related to WHERE are: 
    
   4.8.1.6 Geographic Position (GEO) 
   4.8.1.7 Location 
    
   SKiCal objects SHOULD use vCards as ALTREP parameter to the LOCATION 
   property parameter, in order to provide machine readability and 
   maintain information structure when exchanging data. 
 
   In addition to the properties named above as defined in RFC-2445, a 
   SKiCal object may include the following properties; 
 
3.4.1   Directions 
    
   Property Name: X-SKI-DIRECTIONS  
    
   Purpose: This property can be used to specify helpful directions for 
   finding the event. 
    
   Value Type: TEXT. 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: Very often when a public event is published, there are 
   instructions other than the address for finding the location. In 
   metropolitan areas this could be just the name of a subway stop, 
   while on the sea it could possibly be a path defined by a series of 
   GEO (longitude+latitude) coordinates which will help sailors avoid 
   shallow water. 
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
     x-ski-directions = "X-SKI-DIRECTIONS" directionsparam ":"  
                        text CRLF 
    
       directionsparam  = *( 
                   ; the following is optional, 
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once 
                   (";" languageparam ) / (";" altrepparam ) /  
                   (";" travelbyparam) / (";" geo-path) / 
    
                   ; the following is optional, 
                   ; and MAY occur more than once 
                   (";" xparam)  
                       draft-many-ical-ski-00.txt 

                   ) 
    
     travelbyparam = "TRAVELBY" "=" ("walk" / "bicycle" / "boat" /     
                     "car" / "rail" / "air" / "public_transportation" /  
                     "frequency" / "uri" ) 
    
     geo-path = "GEO-PATH" "=" 1*(float "," float ",")(float "," float)    
    
                ; machine readable directions 
                ; coordinate pair sequence approaching destination 
    
   Example: The following is an example of this property: 
 
     X-SKI-DIRECTIONS;TRAVELBY=public_transportation;LANGUAGE=se:Tunne 
      lbanestation Globen 
     X-SKI-DIRECTIONS:Rum 207, plan 2 
     X-SKI-DIRECTIONS;GEO-PATH=17.76545,59.8766,17.76532,59.8755,17.76 
      525,59.8726;TRAVELBY=walk:Walk the path along the lake, turn lef 
      t after the waterfall, follow yellow signs  
    
3.4.2   Place name 
    
   Property Name: X-SKI-PLACENAME  
    
   Purpose: This property can be used to specify a well known name of 
   the place where the event takes place.  
    
   Value Type: TEXT. 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: Names which have reached a status of common knowledge 
   among a significant portion of the populace (eg. Taxi drivers). If 
   the exact name is chosen from a naming list as discussed in this 
   memo, section 4, further details may be available to the 
   uninitiated. 
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
     x-ski-placename = "X-SKI-PLACENAME" languageparam ":" text CRLF 
    
                       ; It is RECOMMENDED that the text value be  
                       ; chosen from a list, as described in section 4  
                       ; of this memo. 
    
   Example: The following is an example of this property: 
    
     X-SKI-PLACENAME;Globen 
    
3.4.3   Media addresses. 
                       draft-many-ical-ski-00.txt 

      
   The European Broadcasting Union, in conjunction with the 
   introduction of new digital television and radio broadcasting, is 
   currently developing a standard for media addresses, such as 
   frequencies and frequency ranges, satellite ranges, cable ranges and 
   so forth.  Time permitting, the SKiCal working group hopes to take 
   part of and interact with this work, resulting in recommendations 
   for appropriate properties and property parameters. 
    
3.5   WHOW (HOW) properties  
    
   WHOW properties are arguably SKiCal's most significant addition to 
   iCal. These properties represent the mechanics of coupling an event 
   seeker to an event, the conditions, rules, qualifications, 
   economics, quirks and hindrances involved. 
    
   These properties answer questions such as "Can I bring a camera?", 
   "How can I get a ticket?", "Is there an age requirement, or parental 
   guidance?", for example.  
    
   There is no property defined in RFC-2445 [3] that the SKiCal working 
   group considers related to WHOW. 
    
3.5.1   Qualification for admission 
    
   Property Name: X-SKI-ADMISSION  
    
   Purpose: This property can be used to specify a qualification for 
   gaining admission to an event. Note that admission and participation 
   are not the same thing.  You may be allowed admittance to a bowling 
   alley but you may be prohibited from actually bowling. 
    
   Value Type: TEXT. 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: This property can be used to specify a condition of the 
   attendee. It could be a recommendation, a requirement or the 
   reverse, which helps in the decision as to whether or not the 
   receiver of the SKiCal object whishes to attend the event or not. 
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
     x-ski-admission = "X-SKI-ADMISSION" qualparam ":"  
                           text ";" qualifier CRLF 
    
                       ; It is RECOMMENDED that the text value be  
                       ; chosen from a list, as described in section 4  
                       ; of this memo.

3.5.2   Qualification for participation 
    
   Property Name: X-SKI-PARTICIPATION  
    
   Purpose: This property can be used to specify a qualification for 
   participating in an event.  
    
   Value Type: TEXT. 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: This property can be used to specify a property of the 
   attendee. It could be a recommendation, a requirement or the 
   reverse, which helps the receiver of the SKiCal object know if they 
   are qualified to participate in the event. 
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
     x-ski-participation = "X-SKI-PARTICIPATION" qualparam ":"  
                           text ";" qualifier CRLF

3.5.3   Price 
    
   Property Name: X-SKI-PRICE  
    
   Purpose: This property gives pricing information about the event. 
    
   Value Type: TEXT.  
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: This property can be used to provide information about 
   the pricing of an event. Due to the largely divergent pricing 
   structures that exist, perhaps not all aspects of pricing will be 
   possible to represent in a machine readable format using SkiCAl (eg. 
   "Especially for you" prices and negotiable discounts). But at least 
   this attempt will allow for the more easily described structures to

3.6   WHY properties  
    
   The following properties answer questions about the event such as 
   "Why should I attend?" and "Why would this be interesting?". 
    
   WHY gathers promotional, instructive, informational material under 
   one roof.  The SkiCal WG has an ulterior motive for doing so.  Many 
   of the up and coming SKiCal applications will be operating in a 
   narrow bandwidth environment, this is specially the case with mobile 
   browsers. 
    
   By placing content which might be bulky and bandwidth consuming in a 
   specifically defined area of the Calendar Object, the event seeker 
   as well as the event publisher is given greater control in 
   separating  lightweight "prima vista" data transfers from 
   heavyweight "the whole picture" data transfers. 
                       draft-many-ical-ski-00.txt

   group considers related to WHY.

3.7   WHO properties 
    
   The following properties answer questions about the event such as 
   "Who is responsible for the event?". They refer to the organizer of 
   the event. It is important to clearly establish the "WhoDoUsue" for 
   each event.  
    
                       draft-many-ical-ski-00.txt 

   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] that the SKiCal working group 
   considers related to WHO are: 
    
   4.8.4.2 Contact 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that SKiCal objects use vCards as ALTREP parameter 
   to the CONTACT property parameter, in order to provide machine 
   readability and maintain information structure when exchanging data. 
 
   In addition to the properties named above as defined in RFC-2445, a 
   SKiCal object may include the following properties; 
    
3.7.1   Responsible 
    
   Property Name: X-SKI-RESPONSIBLE 
    
   Purpose: This property indicates who is responsible for the event. 
    
   Value Type: TEXT. (MAILTO) 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: In some countries, any planned public event with more 
   than 5 persons attending must have a person or an organization which 
   is legally responsible for the event. Any public business must have 
   a person who is legally responsible for that business. We call these  
   responsible persons and organization the "WhoDoUsue". This property 
   is intended to identify and define the WhoDoUsue. 
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
     x-ski-responsible = "X-SKI-RESPONSIBLE" resonsibleparam ":"  
                         uri CRLF 
    
                         ; the value MUST be a MAILTO URI, as defined  
                         ; by RFC-1738 [7]. 
    
     responsibleparam  = *( 
                   ; the following is optional, 
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once 
                   (";" languageparam ) / (";" cnparam ) / 
    
                   ; the following is optional, 
                   ; and MAY occur more than once 
    
                   (";" xparam) 
                   ) 
    
   Example: The following is an example of this property:

     X-SKI-RESPONSIBLE;CN=Opera house:MAILTO:info@opera.de 
     X-SKI-RESPONSIBLE:MAILTO:jean-marie@petiteville.fr 
    
3.7.2   Other agents 
    
   Property Name: X-SKI-OTHERAGENTS 
    
   Purpose: This property is intended to identify persons and 
   organizations which are in some way contributing to the event, but 
   not as the main WhoDoUsue. 
    
   Value Type: TEXT. (MAILTO) 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: At football games, for example, there are often several 
   organizations involved: The owner of the stadium, the two teams, the 
   ticketing agency and sometimes the organizer of a tournament. This 
   property makes it possible to indicate all of these organizers, not 
   to be confused with the legally responsible organizer.  
    
   Examples: The following are examples of this property: 
    
     X-SKI-OTHERAGENTS:MAILTO:info@ematelstar.se  
     X-SKI-OTHERAGENTS;CN=Stockholms stad:MAILTO:kultur@stadshuset.a.se 
    
3.7.3   Association 
    
   Property Name: X-SKI-ASSOCIATION  
    
   Purpose: This property can be specified to indicate organizations of 
   which the organizer is a member.  
    
   Value Type: TEXT.  
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: If, for example, a little known organizer of an event 
   is a member of a well known organization, this information will be 
   very valuable to anybody considering to participate.  We expect that 
   this information will be verifiable with an online authoritative 
   source 
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
                       draft-many-ical-ski-00.txt 

     x-ski-association = "X-SKI-ASSOCIATION" associationparam ":"  
                         uri CRLF 
    
                         ; the value MUST be a MAILTO URI, as defined          
                         ; by RFC-1738 [7]. 
    
     associationparam  = *(

                   (";" xparam) 
                   ) 
    
   Example: The following are examples of this property:

     X-SKI-ASSOCIATION;CN=Rotary international:MAILTO:rotary@rotary.org 
    
3.8   MANAGEMENT properties 
    
   The above SKiCal component properties all describe the event itself 
   (description) and not, as is the case with many iCalendar component 
   properties, the entry in a calendar user agent (CUA) or calendar 
   server (CS) (self-description).  
    
   It is possible that several, or even many calendar objects could 
   refer to the same event. And each of these calendar objects could 
   have their own publisher.  While the event has only one responsible 
   authority.            
    
   It is the ambition of the SKiCal WG to empower the event with the 
   same means of identification and validation as the Calsch WG has 
   given the calendar object. 
    
   A point in case is the property: 4.8.4.3 ORGANIZER, which as 
   described in RFC-2445 defines the organizer for a calendar component 
   - not the organizer for the event.  SKiCal would have preferred to 
   call this property PUBLISHER and retain the term ORGANIZER for the 
   actual organizer of the event itself.  In lieu of this happening we 
   are using the term RESPONSIBLE for the Event's WhoDoUsue and 
   recommend the term PUBLISHER for the publisher of the Calendar 
   object. 
 
   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] that the SKiCal working group 
   considers related to MANAGEMENT are: 
    
   4.8.1.3 Classification 
   4.8.1.4 Comment 
   4.8.1.11 Status 
                       draft-many-ical-ski-00.txt 

   4.8.4.3 Organizer 
   4.8.4.5 Related-to 
   4.8.4.6 Uniform Resource Locator 
   4.8.4.7 Unique Identifier 
   4.8.5 Recurrence Component Properties 
   4.8.7.1 Date/Time Created 
   4.8.7.2 Date/Time Stamp 
   4.8.7.3 Last Modified 
   4.8.7.4 Sequence Number 
    
3.8.1   Checksum 
    
   Property Name: X-SKI-CHECKSUM  
    
   Purpose: This parameter can be used to confirm that the calendar 
   object remains unaltered. 
    
   Value Type: INTEGER 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: This property is not yet fully defined. 
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
     x-ski-checksum = "X-SKI-CHECKSUM" ":" calculatedsum CRLF 
    
     calculatedsum = <checksum calculated from the rest of the object> 
                     ; Work in progress 
    
   Example: The following is an example of this property: 
    
     X-SKI-EVENT-CHECKSUM:948 
    
3.8.2   Publisher 
    
   Property Name: X-SKI-PUBLISHER  
    
   Purpose: Describes the organization which publishes the event 
   object. 
 
   Value Type: URI 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
                       draft-many-ical-ski-00.txt 

   Description: In the case of public events, the organizer of an event 
   is not always the one who makes the information about the event 
   available.  
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
     x-ski-publisher = "X-SKI-PUBLISHER" ":" mailto CRLF 
    
   Example: The following is an example of this property: 
    
     X-SKI-PUBLISHER:mailto:info@timeout.co.uk 
    
4    Choosing values from lists 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that text values be chosen from "authoritative 
   naming lists" whenever possible. Doing this, the publisher will 
   increase the level of machine readability and thus increase the 
   accumulated global value of all iCalendar/SKiCal objects. It is 
   expected that such lists will become widely available and accessible 
   online, possibly in the RDF [8] format. The informal SKiCal working 
   group is looking into this possibility, but the design of this is 
   not further elaborated in this memo. 
    
   One example of such a naming list is the list of words describing 
   tourist resources, which is being published by the European Tourist 
   Councils. Each entry in this list has a translation into all 
   European languages, and events using entries from this list as 
   values of the Categories property may therefore be correctly 
   presented in event databases all around Europe (provided that the 
   software knows how to fetch the translation from the list). 
   Another example is the Olson database of time zones, as mentioned in 
   RFC-2445, section 4.8.3.1. 
    
4.1   List example for qualparam 
    
   SkiCal sorts qualification parameters under the following headings:  
    
   Attendee related parameters: 
    
   a) the physical attributes of the attendee. Visible, roughly   
   apparent. 
    
        AGE 
        BIRTH-DATE 
        GENDER 
        HEIGHT 
        WEIGHT 
    
                ;extensions of this list could also include attributes 
                ;such as blood type, hair color, biceps measurements 
                ;and so forth. 
     
    
                       draft-many-ical-ski-00.txt 

   b) Knowledge-level/position/ownership status that the attendee has 
   obtained and/or documents which the attendee might possess  for the 
   purpose of verifying that status 
    
        SKILL 
                ; implies a level of physical/intellectual attainment 
        MEMBERSHIP 
                ; implies the existence of a verifiable list or an 
                ; event officials first 
                ; hand knowledge that the attendee belongs to a certain 
                ; group of organization   
                 
        CERTIFICATE 
                ; credentials of proof that the attendee meets  
                ; with criteria specified by the Event Organizers. 
                 
                ; Both SKILL and MEMBERSHIP might be verified by a 
                ; CERTIFICATE which the attendee is carrying or they 
                ; might be verifiable on-line or from a list at the 
                ; "gate", or the attendee may be trusted to be self- 
                ; verifying.  
    
   c) what an attendee has in her possession. 
                 
        POSSESSION-OF 
    
                ; This parameter is about physical objects e.g. guns, 
                ; cameras, water bottles, binoculars, warm clothes, ice 
                ; skates, bathing suits, literature, and animals which 
                ; the event seeker would or would not have in their 
                ; possession when attending the event.    
    
   External factor parameters: 
                 
   d) responses to Natural conditions

        PRE-BOOKING 
        RESERVATIONS  
    
5    Intended use  
    
   The exchange and proliferation of event related information. 
    
   Event organizers can publish their information (for example on web 
   servers), in the SKiCal format as defined by this memo. This will 
   enable calendar publishers to launch software spiders that collect 
   this information. This eliminates the need for publishers to 
   manually enter the information into their databases, and makes it 
   much easier for event organizers to get their information across to 
   the eventual interested audience. 
    
5.1   Differences between SKiCal and iCalendar. 
 
   Here are some of the major differences between the potential users 
   of iCalendar (iCal) and SKiCal. 
    
   A typical iCal user will consider their Calendar application an 
   important, if not indispensable, tool in their interaction with 
   fellow workers in the same company - or same cross-company project.  
   Most SKiCal users will not use a computer based calendar program 
   more than casually, if at all. 
    
   iCal objects will invariably end up in a user's calendar.  SKiCal 
   objects will more likely be printed in newspapers & print-on-demand 
   compilations, presented in mobile browsers (WAP) and desktop 
   browsers, shown on text television, auto-voiced over telephones,  
   pushed or called-up through an assortment of yet to be invented 
   digiphernalia.  
    
   Most iCal objects will be created by known organizers, for known 
   attendees, of a known quantity, meeting in known places, dealing 
   with known topics.  Many SKiCal objects will be created by unknown 
   organizers, for unknown attendees, of an unknown quantity, meeting 
   in unknown places, to take part in unknown events. 
    
   SKiCal users will typically search for certain property combination 
   outcomes amongst millions of possible property combinations.  iCal 
   users will  be invited to join in on specific events, many of which 
   will not come as a surprise. 
    
                       draft-many-ical-ski-00.txt 

   SKiCal knowledge retrieval processes will be both and crisp and 
   fuzzy.  iCal processes will almost always be crisp. 
    
   A SKiCal object is always the description of an external (to the 
   SKiCal object) thing.  An iCal object will often be self descriptive 
   with some references to external things, such as a meeting room. 
  
    
6    Security considerations 
    
   Anybody could produce a SKiCal compliant file containing false 
   information. Calendar publishers will need to be cautious, or they 
   may end up publishing invalid information. Security can be achieved 
   either by choosing to index SKiCal files only from trusted servers, 
   or by employing a moderator who can correct or refuse corrupt  
   information. Nobody should consider information from non-encrypted 
   SKiCal files 100% reliable, just as nobody should blindly trust 
   printed advertisements or email. 
    
   More reliable information can be expected once safe connections to 
   electronic commerce solutions are established. 
    
   Event organizers and publishers should be aware of legal 
   implications from spreading personal information in electronic 
   media. 
    
7    Internationalization/localization 
    
   Text valued properties containing non-us-ascii characters should be 
   properly encoded with base-64 or quoted-printable, as specified in 
   [3]. 
    
   Timezones are handled with VTIMEZONE components, as specified in 
   [3].
