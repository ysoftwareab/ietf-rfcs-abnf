1. Introduction 

       RAN has its own synchronization requirements whatever its 
   backhaul based on IP/MPLS packet switched networks and TDM/ATM links. 
   Besides radio interface synchronization, Iub and Iu have the same 
   synchronization requirements when is based packet network. In this 
   RAN synchronization requirements we give some applications 
   description about RAN synchronization. Also we list synchronization 
   scenario and requirements in RAN.

2. Applications Description 

2.1. Time Service Applications 

    There are many applications in telecommunications that need to know 
the time with great precision. If there would be some services that 
require great precision such as position services, then RAN system has 
to provide precise time synchronization. In TDD mode of 2G/3G system, 
radio interface time synchronization is also needed for smooth handover. 

2.2. Frequency Service Applications 

    Cellular base-stations require a highly accurate frequency reference 
from which they derive transmission frequencies and operational timing 
however their transport is over E1/T1 or PSN, such as Ethernet IP and 
MPLS. The radio frequencies should be accurate. To use radio spectrum 
efficiently transmission frequencies which are allocated to a given 
base station and its neighbors had better not interfere with each other. 
There is an additional requirement derived from the need for smooth 
handover when a mobile station crosses from one cell to another. 

3. Synchronization Description and Requirements 

    As to RAN synchronization issues, we may say it include "Network 
synchronization" "Node Synchronization" "Transport Channel 
synchronization" "Radio Interface synchronization" "Time Alignment 
Handling" "Uplink synchronization"[1]. Actually when we mention these 
six "Synchronization",we mean different synchronization mechanisms in 
RAN system, not mean synchronization requirements.AS to RAN 
synchronization requirements, it can be more simple. We could conclude 
into only three kinds of synchronization requirements: network 
synchronization¡¢node synchronization and time alignment over Iu 
interface.

3.1. Network Synchronization  

3.1.1. Synchronization Description 

       Network synchronization relates to the distribution of 
   synchronization references to the RAN Nodes and the stability of the 
   clocks in the RAN. This distribution of synchronization references 
   includes the distribution in Iu interface Iub interface and radio 
   interface. To fulfill the distribution of an accurate frequency 
   reference to the network elements in the UTRAN, network has to 
   provide a synchronization reference with enough frequency accuracy. 

       RNC should be able to pick-up synchronization information from Iu 
   interface. Synchronization of Iub interface is provided from RNC. The 
   clock to be implemented in UTRAN Nodes shall be chosen with 
   characteristics that depend on the L1 adopted. For example in order 
   to support STM-N interfaces at the RNC, the ITU-T Recommendation 
   G.813 (see reference) may be sufficient. But we still have some 
   common requirement for RNC. 

3.1.2. Minimum Requirements 

       The reference frequency accuracy of RNC shall be better than or 
   equal to 4.6ppm.When outside reference clock is invalid, system clock

   of RNC should be able to change into Holdover mode. Output of system 
   clock should be able to hold original phase and accuracy of 4.6ppm. 

       As to Iub and Iu interfaces, different L1 links and interfaces 
   have different synchronization requirement. For E1 interfaces
   frequency accuracy should be better than or equal to 50ppm(see 
   reference to ITU-T G.703).For STM-N interfaces frequency accuracy 
   should be better than or equal to 4.6ppm see (reference to ITU-T 
   G.813).For packet switched network frequency accuracy requirement 
   level is not so strict.  

       The frequency accuracy of base stations shall be better than or 
   equal to 0.05ppm on the radio interface whatever based TDD mode or 
   FDD mode. 

3.2. Node Synchronization  

3.2.1. Synchronization Description 

        Node Synchronization relates to the estimation and compensation 
   of timing difference among RAN nodes. Node synchronization includes 
   two types: "RNC-NodeB" and "Inter NodeB" Node Synchronization. 

       "RNC-NodeB" Node Synchronization allows getting knowledge of the 
   timing differences between RNC and its NodeBs. When there is some 
   position service, "RNC-NodeB" Node Synchronization would be important. 

       "Inter NodeB" Node Synchronization aims to achieve a common 
   timing reference among NodeB's. The achievement of a common timing 
   reference among NodeB's may be used in TDD to support Cell 
   Synchronization in order to minimize cross-interference. 

3.2.2. Minimum Requirements 

       As to "RNC-NodeB" Node Synchronization, timing accuracy 
   requirement level in packet switched network is not so strict. For 
   example as to Ethernet, better than 1ms may be sufficient. If radio 
   timing reference would pick-up time from Iu interface, then "RNC-
   NodeB" Node Synchronization would be stricter, for example maybe to 
   support 3us. 

       "Inter NodeB" Node Synchronization in TDD should be better than 
   or equal to 3us.Base station synchronization accuracy is defined as 
   the maximum deviation in frame start times between any pair of base 
   stations on the same frequency that have overlapping coverage areas.

3.3. Time Alignment over Iu 

3.3.1. Synchronization Description 

       Time Alignment over Iu mainly aims to provide an accurate timing 
   reference to Iub or even radio reference. 

3.3.2. Minimum Requirements 

       Node Synchronization, timing accuracy requirement level in packet 
   switched network is not so strict. For example as to Ethernet, better 
   than 1ms may be sufficient. But if radio timing reference would pick-
   up time from Iub through Iu interface, then time alignment over Iu 
   would be stricter, for example maybe to support 3us. 

4. Security Considerations 

       Time and frequency services are critical in RAN. Hence time and 
   frequency transfer services MUST be protected from being compromised.  
   The most significant threat is a false time or frequency server being 
   accepted instead of a true one, thus enabling a hacker to bring down 
   critical services. Any protection mechanism must be designed in such 
   a way that it does not degrade the quality of the time transfer. 

5. IANA Considerations 

       No IANA actions are required as a result of the publication of 
   this document.
