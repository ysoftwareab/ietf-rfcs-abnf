Abstract 

   [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp] defines a method for rapid 
   acquisition of multicast sessions (RAMS).  Upon accepting the first 
   RAMS-R message, RS MUST echo an RAMS-I message as a response to RR.  
   This document proposes to optionally convey a parameter called 
   unicast backspace in the RAMS-I message.  Unicast backspace is the 
   RTP timestamp difference between the first unicast burst packet to be 
   sent and the latest primary multicast packet in the buffer of RS.  
   The RTP timestamps values for these packets are taken from the 
   primary multicast stream.  The parameter is a constant once RS 
   chooses a starting point for the unicast burst.  This parameter can 
   be used by RR to determine when to join the primary multicast session. 
   RR would not rely on RAMS-I to revise the earliest multicast join 
   time after the burst rate is changed by RS and therefore is immune to 
   the lose of RAMS-I. Moreover, if this parameter is known, RR with 
   appropriate playback control can reduce the additional end-to-end 
   delay introduced by the RAMS process or can enable the RS to serve 
   the RR with shorter burst duration and therefore save the bandwidth 
   of RS export and the burst forwarding path.

Internet-Draft         New TLV Element in RAMS           November 2009 
    

1. Introduction 

   Per [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp], RS may change the 
   unicast burst rate during the acquisition process, decided by itself 
   or based on some feedback information from RR.  RS may therefore 
   recalculate the earliest multicast join time and send the revised 
   values to RR using additional RAMS-I messages.  If such an RAMS-I 
   message gets lost, RR would fail to update its multicast join time 
   accordingly and therefore join the multicast session at an 
   inappropriate time.  This increases the chance and amount of overlap 
   or gap between the unicast burst and primary multicast stream.  In 
   order to solve this problem, this document proposes to convey a field 
   called unicast backspace in the first RAMS-I message which is as a 
   response to the acceptance of the first RAMS-R message.  Unicast 
   backspace is the RTP time stamp difference between the first unicast 
   burst packet to be sent and the latest primary multicast packet in 
   the buffer of RS.  The RTP timestamps values for these packets are 
   taken from the primary multicast stream. 

   Unicast backspace is a constant once the start point of the unicast 
   burst is decided by RS.  This value, in conjunction with some 
   parameters that are known to RR, e.g. burst rate, playback rate, 
   amount of buffered data, and initial playback delay, can be used by 
   RR to heuristically determine when to launch multicast join process 
   by sending an SFGMP join message. RR therefore may not count on RAMS-
   I to notify the SFGMP join time update due to burst rate change 
   during the rapid acquisition and therefore may alleviate the RS 
   implementation complexity for re-deducing multicast join time. And 
   this way, the amount of protocol signaling interaction between RS and 
   RR may be reduced. Furthermore, when unicast backspace value is known, 
   RR may remove or reduce the additional end-to-end delay introduced by 
   the RAMS process by appropriately controlling the playback process, 
   such that the playback can be synchronized with other users of the 
   same primary multicast session. 

   Note that how RR uses this field to deduce when RR launch the 
   multicast join process is out of scope of this document.

3. Unicast Backspace Field 

   Unicast backspace (32 bits): Optional TLV element.  This field gives 
   the RTP timestamp difference between the first unicast burst packet 
   to be sent and the latest primary multicast packet in the buffer.  
   The RTP timestamps values for these packets are taken from the 
   primary multicast stream. The value of unicast backspace indicates 
   the amount of data that would be additional transmitted to RR 
   compared to when the RAMS process is not in use. This field SHOULD be 
   conveyed in the first RAMS-I message and MAY be conveyed in other 
   RAMS-I messages.  RR MAY use this field to determine when to join the 
   multicast session by sending an SFGMP join message. 

4. Example Message Flow 

   Figure 1 depicts an example of messaging flow for RR using backspace 
   field to heuristically determine the multicast join time.

   ~~~> SFGMP Messages 

   ...> Unicast RTP Flow 

   ---> Multicast RTP Flow 

   The example is described by the following steps: 

   1. RR sends an RTCP RAMS-R message to RS to request a rapid 
      acquisition process. 

   2. Upon accepting of the RAMS-R message, RS sends an RTCP RAMS-I 
      message with unicast backspace field to RR. 

   3. RS transmit Unicast RTP Burst to RR. 

   4. During the burst, RR uses the value of unicast backspace to 
      determine when to send SFGMP Join message to join the primary 
      multicast group.  For example, RR (periodically) estimates the 
      buffer occupation in terms of media timestamp offset between the 
      first and the last RTP packets in the buffer (called B for 
      example).  If the difference between the unicast backspace value 
      and B is less than or equal to a pre-defined threshold value, RR 
      begins to join the multicast session.  Unicast backspace is a 
      determinate value and is always fixed during the burst.  The 
      amount of data in the buffer is known by RR.  The threshold value 
      can be derived as equal to  

                   ((b_r - p_r) / p_r) * multicast_join_latency  

      where b_r is the burst rate, p_r is the playback rate, and 
      multicast_join_latency is the delay between RR sending SFGMP join 
      message and RR getting the first primary multicast packet.   

      This way, RR would not rely on RAMS-I to revise the earliest 
      multicast join time after the burst rate is changed by RS. 

   In addition to calculating multicast join time, when the unicast 
   backspace is known, RR may remove or reduce the additional end-to-end 
   delay introduced by the RAMS process by appropriately controlling the 
   playback process, for example speeding up the playback, such that the 
   playback can be synchronized with other users of the same primary 
   multicast session. Or on the other hand, with this parameter, RR may 
   lower the playback to prevent its de-jitter and retransmission buffer 
   from under-run. This way, RS can tailor the burst in shorter burst 
   duration and thus save the bandwidth of RS export and the burst 
   forwarding path.
