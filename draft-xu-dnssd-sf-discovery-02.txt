   services.  When applying a particular Service Function Chain (SFC) to
   the traffic classified by the SFC classifier, the traffic needs to be
   steered through an ordered set of Service Functions (SFs) in the
   network.  This document describes how to discover SFs in SPRING
   networks based on DNS-SD.

1.  Introduction

   Service Function Chaining [I-D.ietf-sfc-architecture] provides a
   flexible way to construct services.  When applying a particular
   service function chain to the traffic classified by the SFC
   classifier, the traffic needs to be steered through an ordered set of
   Service Functions (SFs) in the network.  This document describes how
   to discover SFs in SPRING networks (a.k.a.  Segment Routing networks,
   SR networks) [I-D.xu-sfc-using-mpls-spring] based on DNS-SD
   [RFC6763].

   In a given SFC domain, multiple instances of a given SF can be
   enabled.  As specified in [RFC6763], a particular SF instance can be
   described using a DNS SRV [RFC2782] and DNS TXT [RFC1035] record.
   The SRV record has a name of the form "<Instance>.<Service>.<Domain>"
   and gives the target host (representing the Service Function
   Forwarder) where the SF instance can be reached (Note that the port
   number given by the SRV record is meaningless in the SFC case).  The
   DNS TXT record of the same name gives additional information (such as
   capacity, current load, service function SID) about this SF instance,

   in a structured form using key/value pairs.  A client discovers the
   list of available SF instances of a given service type using a query
   for a DNS PTR [RFC1035] record with a name of the form
   "<Service>.<Domain>".

   This document specifies that SF instances defined in the SFC
   architecture can be discovered and described using DNS-SD.  This
   document proposes no change to the structure of DNS messages, and no
   new operation codes, response codes, resource record types, or any
   other new DNS protocol values.

2.  Terminology

   This section contains definitions for terms used frequently
   throughout this document.  However, many additional definitions can
   be found in [RFC6763] and [I-D.ietf-sfc-architecture].

      Service Function (SF): A function that is responsible for specific
      treatment of received packets.  A Service Function can act at
      various layers of a protocol stack (e.g., at the network layer or
      other OSI layers).  As a logical component, a Service Function can
      be realized as a virtual element or be embedded in a physical
      network element.  One or more Service Functions can be embedded in
      the same network element.  Multiple occurrences of the Service
      Function can exist in the same administrative domain.

      Service Function Chain (SFC): A service function chain defines a
      set of abstract service functions and ordering constraints that
      must be applied to packets and/or frames selected as a result of
      classification.

      SF Identifier (SF ID): A unique identifier that represents a
      service function within an SFC-enabled domain.

      Service Function Forwarder (SFF): A service function forwarder is
      responsible for delivering traffic received from the network to
      one or more connected service functions according to information
      carried in the SFC encapsulation, as well as handling traffic
      coming back from the SF.

      SID: Segment Identifier

      Service Function SID: A locally unique SID indicating a particular
      service function on an SFF.

3.  DNS-SD Extensions for SF Discovery

3.1.  Service Instance Enumeration (Browsing)

   The Service Instance Enumeration is the same as defined in section 4
   of [RFC6763].  [RFC6763] borrows the logical service-naming syntax
   and semantics from DNS SRV records, but adds one level of
   indirection.  Instead of requesting records of type "SRV" with name
   "_ipp._tcp.example.com.", the client requests records of type "PTR"
   (pointer from one name to another in the DNS namespace) [RFC1035].

   The result of this PTR lookup for the name "<Service>.<Domain>" is a
   set of zero or more PTR records giving Service Instance Names of the
   form:

      Service Instance Name = <Instance>.<Service>.<Domain>

   The <Instance> portion of the Service Instance Name is a user-
   friendly name consisting of arbitrary Net-Unicode text [RFC5198].

   The <Service> portion of the Service Instance Name is used to
   indicate SF type or SF name, such as Firewall, DPI, NAT, etc.

   The <Domain> portion of the Service Instance Name specifies the DNS
   subdomain within which those names are registered.  In the SFC case,
   the <Domain> is SFC-enabled domain, such as "*.sfc.example.com".

3.2.  Service Instance Resolution

   The Service Instance Resolution is same as defined in section 5 of
   [RFC6763].  When a client needs to contact a particular service
   function instance, identified by an SF Instance Name, previously
   discovered via Service Instance Enumeration (browsing), it queries
   for the SRV and TXT records of that name.  The SRV record for an SF
   gives the target host name (i.e.  Service Function Forwarder) where
   the SF may be found.  The TXT record gives additional information
   about the SF, such as capacity, current load, service function SID,
   etc.  In the SFC case, the port number is meaningless.

3.3.  Data Syntax for DNS-SD TXT Records

   The Data Syntax for DNS-SD TXT Records is same as defined in section
   6 of [RFC6763].  Some services discovered via Service Instance
   Enumeration may need more than just an IP address of the target host
   to completely identify the service instance.  The necessary
   additional data is stored in a TXT record with the same name as the
   SRV record.

3.3.1.  SF TXT Record

   The intention of SF TXT records is to convey a small amount of useful
   additional information about an SF instance.  The TXT record below
   contains some general key/value pairs for an SF instance:

                   +====================================+
                   | key        | value                 |
                   +====================================+
                   | sfsid      | service_function_sid  |
                   +------------+-----------------------+
                   | capacity   | max_no                |
                   +------------+-----------------------+
                   | load       | percentage            |
                   +------------+-----------------------+
                   | status     | F/T                   |
                   +------------+-----------------------+
                   | protocol   | x                     |
                   +------------+-----------------------+

      key=value: DNS TXT records to store arbitrary key/value pairs
      conveying additional information about the named SF instance.

      sfsid=service_function_sid: The Service Function SID for the named
      SF instance.

      capacity=max_no: The capacity of the named SF instance.  For
      example, this information can refer to the maximum number of
      binding entries that can be supported by a NAT SF.

      load=percentage: The current load of the named SF instance.  This
      information may be used for load-balancing purposes for instance.
      This parameter may reflect the amount of active NAT entries vs.
      the total amount of entries.

      status=F/T: The status represents the availability of the named SF
      instance.  F means false (i.e. not available), while T means True
      (i.e. available).

      protocol=x: The protocol that the named SF instance supports if it
      is allowed to communicated to its Policy Decision Point (PDP).
      The PDP is responsible for enforcing appropriate policies in SF.
      PDP-made policy rules can be forwarded to the SF by using a
      variety of protocols (e.g., NETCONF [RFC6241], Diameter
      [RFC3588]).

   The other exclusive key/value pairs pertaining to a particular kind
   of SF instance can be extended in the same way.  This part is TBD.

4.  Example for SF Discovery

   For example, SF1 (NAT), SF2 (Firewall) and SF3 (Load Balance) (as
   shown in Figure 1) are in the "sfc.example.com" domain.  A client
   (e.g.  SFC classifier or PDP) wants to discover the list of available
   instances of a given service type (e.g.  Firewall).

   First, the client uses a query for a DNS PTR record with a name of
   the form:

           "<firewall>.<sfc.example.com>"

   The result of this PTR lookup is a set of two PTR records giving
   Service Instance Names of the form:

       "<instance1>.<firewall>.<sfc.example.com>"
       "<instance2>.<firewall>.<sfc.example.com>"

   Secondly, the client queries for the SRV and TXT records of a
   particular SF instance (e.g. instance1).  The SRV record for
   instance1 gives the target host name where this instance may be
   found, i.e. in this example, the target host name for
   "<instance1>.<firewall>.<sfc.example.com >" is SFF 1.  The TXT record
   gives additional information about instance1, as described in
   Table 1:

                     Table 1: DNS SRV/TXT Record Pairs
+------------------------+------------------------+--------------------+
|      SF Instance       |     SRV Record         |   TXT Record       |
+------------------------+------------------------+--------------------+
|<instance1>.<firewall>. |  Host: SFF 1           |  sfsid=1000        |
|<sfc.example.com>       |                        |                    |
|                        |  Port: Not Available   |  capacity=1024     |
|                        |                        |                    |
|                        |                        |  load=60%          |
|                        |                        |                    |
|                        |                        |  status=T          |
|                        |                        |                    |
|                        |                        |  protocol=Diameter |
+------------------------+------------------------+--------------------+

   Lastly, the address of the SRV record's target host is given by the
   appropriate IPv6 "AAAA" address records or IPv4 "A" records.
