Abstract 

   The tv:URI is an existing Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme to 
   refer to television broadcasts. These include all types of analog and 
   digital television broadcasts, like terrestrial TV broadcasts, 
   satellite TV broadcasts, cable TV broadcast, IP television and web 
   TV.

Internet-Draft           Registry for tv:URIs                 June 2007 
    

   This document defines a registry for tv:URIs. A registry is needed to 
   solve the ambiguity about tv:URIs in two directions: for each 
   (registered) tv:URI it identifies uniquely and unambiguously the 
   television broadcast it refers to, and vice versa it provides a 
   single tv:URI for each (registered) television broadcast.

Internet-Draft           Registry for tv:URIs                 June 2007 
    

1. Introduction 

   World-Wide Web browsers, Electronic Program Guide applications, 
   Instant-Messaging clients and Presence functionality are starting to 
   appear on a variety of consumer electronic devices, such as 
   television sets, television set-top boxes and mobile devices capable 
   of receiving television broadcasts. In this respect television 
   broadcasts refers to all forms of analog and digital television 
   broadcasts, such as terrestrial TV broadcasts, satellite TV 
   broadcasts, cable TV broadcasts, IP television and web TV. 

   In the wake of these new types of TV applications a need arises to be 
   able to communicate to others about television broadcasts and as a 
   consequence to be able to have a means of unambiguously referring to 
   such television broadcasts.  

   In [RFC2838] the syntax and semantics of tv:URIs is defined. A tv:URI 
   consists of an identifier part in the form of a domain name, and it 
   identifies a television broadcast. It is, however, not intended for 
   tv:URIs to be resolvable by the internet Domain Name System 
   [RFC1034]. 

   Examples given in [RFC2838] are: 

   o  tv:wqed.org       the WQED station 

   o  tv:nbc.com        the NBC network 

   o  tv:abc.com        the American Broadcast Company 

   o  tv:abc.co.au      the Australian Broadcast Corporation 

   o  tv:east.hbo.com   HBO East 

   o  tv:west.hbo.com   HBO West 

1.1. Use cases for television broadcast identifiers 

   In general there is a need for identifiers referring to TV broadcasts 
   in all situations where communication (via some type of messages or 
   textual content) is taking place and in this communication the sender 
   wants to refer the receiver to a particular TV broadcast.  

   The following diagram illustrates this.

        Figure 1: Communication entities referring to TV broadcasts 

   Note that in general there will be a mapping - by the sender - from a 
   particular TV broadcast to the TV broadcast identifier used in the 
   message (marked by (1) in the diagram) and a mapping - by the 
   receiver - from the received TV broadcast identifier to the correct 
   TV broadcast (marked by (2) in the diagram). 

   Examples of such communication use cases are given in the next 
   sections. 

1.1.1. Clickable link to a television broadcast 

   One application is clickable links to television broadcasts. Web 
   pages, instant messages and emails may contain such links. If you 
   clicked on such a link on a sufficiently equipped and configured 
   device, you would view the identified television broadcast. This 
   application may be used to send and receive television watching tips. 

   Note that clicking on a tv:URI might also result in a pull-down menu 
   with various options what to do. 

1.1.2. Presence: see what your buddies are watching 

   Another application is presence. By using the television broadcast 
   identification in presence applications, you can see what programs 
   your buddies are watching. With a single click (see previous example) 
   you can follow the channel switching of a specific buddy. 

   Currently the issue of presence in relation to IPTV has gained 
   considerable attention in standardization bodies such as ETSI. For 
   instance:

Internet-Draft           Registry for tv:URIs                 June 2007 
    

   o  ETSI TISPAN work item 1044, Section 6.2.1.1 states: "It must be 
      possible to define presence information related to the IPTV 
      experience, e.g. channel currently accessed.". 

   o  ETSI TISPAN work item 2048, Section 9.2, titled "Presence 
      attributes for IPTV", states: "The following specific IPTV 
      attributes may also be supported: channel currently accessed, 
      ...". 

1.1.3. Scheduling of tv broadcast in relation to personal calendars 

   It is possible to combine tv:URIs with iCalendar applications. In 
   that way people can integrate what shows they want to watch with 
   their personal calendars. 

2. Need for a registry for tv:URIs 

   There does not (yet) exist a registry for tv:URIs. This means that 
   the allocation of a tv:URI is essentially a mechanism of "guess the 
   URI" in case of finding the appropriate tv:URI for a given television 
   broadcast and a "guess the television broadcast" for a given tv:URI. 

2.1. Ambiguity problems of tv:URIs 

   Two types of ambiguities can occur in the use of tv:URIs: 

   1. Finding ambiguity 

      There may be multiple tv:URIs referring to one and the same 
      television broadcast. For example, one person might choose 
      tv:abc.co.au for the Australian Broadcast Corporation (as has 
      been suggested in [RFC2838]). Another person might choose to use 
      tv:abc.net.au to refer to the same television broadcast 
      ('because' http://abc.net.au point to the website of this 
      broadcast). Note that this relates to mapping (1) in Figure 1. 

   2. Identification ambiguity 

      A single tv:URI might refer to two different television 
      broadcasts. This is the original reason given in [RFC2838] for 
      choosing a domain name structure for tv:URIs. The illustrative 
      example here is "abc", which could refer to the American 
      Broadcast Company or Australian Broadcast Corporation. Note that 
      this relates to mapping (2) in Figure 1.

Internet-Draft           Registry for tv:URIs                 June 2007 
    

   In both cases, the ambiguity would lead to some difficulties when 
   using tv:URIs, but the second type of ambiguity would cause the most 
   problems.  

   In case of finding ambiguity, someone wanting to get at the 
   television broadcast pointed at (supposedly) by a tv:URI might be 
   referred to a television broadcast unknown to his application/device. 
   After having identified the proper broadcast, he can configure this 
   in his application/device for future use. 

   In case of identification ambiguity, someone wanting to get at the 
   television broadcast pointed at by a tv:URI will have a choice of 
   broadcasts. Since one source of the same tv:URI might point at a 
   different broadcast as another source, he can never configure his 
   application/device to always point at the right television broadcast. 

2.2. Solutions to reduce ambiguity 

   Ambiguity (especially identification ambiguity) can be reduced (but 
   maybe not resolved) in different ways. 

2.2.1. Stricter rules for the definition of tv:URIs 

   One approach to reduce the ambiguity problem would be to provide 
   stricter rules for the definition of tv:URIs. Basically [RFC2838] 
   already provided some of such rules to reduce ambiguity. 

   o  Television-broadcast name collisions over multiple countries are 
      solved by adding DNS-style top-level domains. For example 
      tv:abc.com versus tv:abc.co.au. 

   o  Ambiguity over time-zone dependent transmissions are resolved with 
      a time-zone indication. Example: tv:east.hbo.com versus 
      tv:west.hob.com. 

   Additional rules could be formulated to reduce ambiguity even more. 
   For example: 

   o  Rules for numbers in the name of a television broadcast. Example: 
      bbcone versus bbc1. 

   o  Rules for stations with multiple television broadcasts. Example: 
      family.hbo.com versus hbofamily.com 

   o  Rules for (European) public broadcast stations that share one or 
      multiple television broadcast channels. Example: nederland1.nl 
      versus avro.nl.

Internet-Draft           Registry for tv:URIs                 June 2007 
    

   Each new rule would reduce ambiguity a bit more, but it would not 
   prevent ambiguity altogether. 

2.2.2. Association of tv:URIs with websites 

   Another approach to reduce the ambiguity problem would be to 
   associate tv:URI's with web pages. If http://example.com is the 
   official web page of the Example.com television broadcast station, 
   then tv:example.com would be the tv:URI of that television broadcast. 
   Just replace "http://" by "tv:". 

   This approach has several problems. 

   o  Not every television broadcast has its own website. In case of 
      local television station, there may not be an "official" website 
      at all. There are also cases, where multiple television broadcasts 
      share a single website, for example in time-zone dependent 
      broadcasts. 

   o  Some television broadcasts have multiple websites. There may for 
      example be different websites for different languages. Also, web 
      pages often redirect to other web pages. 

   o  Web pages change regularly. Television stations may e.g. decide to 
      replace a convoluted subdomain web page naming structure by better 
      looking second-level domain names. Also ownership changes 
      regularly leading to changes in the naming of websites. 

   o  Web page syntax includes paths (starting with '/') whereas the 
      tv:URI only uses clean DNS-style identifiers in its syntax. An 
      example is the website of the Dutch National Geographic Channel, 
      which has as its 'official' website 
      http://www.nationalgeographic.nl/channel. So associating tv:URIs 
      to web pages would change the syntax of tv:URIs. 

   Hence, this approach would require a change in tv:URI syntax while at 
   the same time not be able to solve every ambiguity. 

2.2.3. Creation of a registry for tv:URIs 

   The only solution to 100% eliminate all ambiguity in the use of 
   tv:URI's is the creation of a registry. This registry would make sure 
   that any television broadcast can be registered and that: 

   1. a registered television broadcast is uniquely identified by a 
      tv:URI.

Internet-Draft           Registry for tv:URIs                 June 2007 
    

   2. a registered tv:URI uniquely identifies a television broadcast. 

3. Organization of the registry for tv:URIs 

   The registry shall be the responsibility of a single organization. It 
   is possible that part of the effort in maintaining the registry is 
   delegated to other (e.g. local) organizations. In this respect a 
   division in terms of registry and registrars similar to that for 
   domain names might be advisable in order to be able to handle the 
   often localized nature of television broadcasts. 

4. Structure of the tv:URI registry 

   The tv:URI registry is a single list of registrations where each 
   registration consist of: 

   o  a television broadcast identifier, and 

   o  an identification record. 

   The television broadcast identifier will be a tv:URI following the 
   syntax described in [RFC2838]. It is this tv:URI that the 
   registration is registering. No two registrations shall have 
   identical tv:URIs. As tv:URIs are case-insensitive two tv:URIs are 
   considered identical if they are the same modulo case-change. 

   The identification record associated with a particular tv:URI 
   contains the following fields: 

   o  The name of the television broadcast. 

   o  (Optionally) The name of company or person that is the 
      holder/owner of the television broadcast. 

   o  (Optionally) The "official" website(s) of the television 
      broadcast. 

   o  (Optionally) The language(s) of the television broadcast. 

   o  (Optionally) The nationality(ies) of the television broadcast. 

   o  (Optionally) The reach of the television broadcast, geographic or 
      otherwise. 

   o  (Optionally) Other useful identifying information.

5. Processes to handle tv:URI registrations 

   This section describes the processes to create, read, update and 
   delete ("CRUD") tv:URI registrations. 

   A process of "nomination" is used for creation, updating and deletion 
   of tv:URI registrations. A registration does not have a registrant in 
   the traditional sense of [RFC3375], but it has a "nominator". This 
   nominator can be a natural person, but it can also be on behalf of an 
   organization. 

   The reason to use a process of nomination by any person or 
   organization instead of direct registration by the owner of the 
   television broadcast is to be independent of this owner for the 
   creation of new innovative television-based services as described in 
   Section 1.1. . 

   The owner of the television broadcast does have a say in the 
   registration, however. This is explained in Section 7. . 

5.1. Creation of tv:URI registrations 

   When it is noticed that a new television broadcast has come into 
   existence, then it can be nominated for assignment of a tv:URI. The 
   nominator has to provide evidence that the television broadcast 
   actually exists and that it has not been registered yet. The 
   nominator has to motivate the proposed new tv:URI for the television 
   broadcast. Moreover, the nominator has to provide sufficient amounts 
   of identifying information on the television broadcast for inclusion 
   in the registry. 

   Once a television broadcast has been nominated for inclusion, the 
   registry will check whether the proposed registration would satisfy 
   the rules for the registration of tv:URIs. These rules are given in 
   Section 6. of this document. If the proposed registration satisfies 
   the rules, then the registration is created. 

5.2. Reading of tv:URI registrations 

   The tv:URI registry will be a public registry. The list of tv:URIs 
   and associated identification records, as described in Section 4. , 
   will be published on a public website. That website may have search 
   functionality to find tv:URIs based on identifying information and 
   vice versa.

Internet-Draft           Registry for tv:URIs                 June 2007 
    

5.3. Updates of tv:URI registrations 

   Identifying information of a television broadcast may change over 
   time. For instance, the television broadcast may have changed website 
   or its geographic reach may have changed. 

   Again, a nominator may indicate that the identifying information 
   associated with a particular television broadcast needs to be 
   changed. 

   Again, the registry will check whether the proposed update would 
   satisfy the rules given in Section 6. of this document. If the 
   proposed update satisfies the rules, then the registration is 
   updated. 

5.4. Deletion of tv:URI registrations 

   Television broadcasts may cease to exist, e.g. due to bankruptcy of 
   its owner. Again, a nominator may nominate the tv:URI for deletion. 
   And again the registry will make the check and consequently delete 
   the tv:URI registration. 

6. Rules for the registration of a new tv:URI 

   A new tv:URI shall satisfy the following rules in order to be 
   suitable for registration in the tv:URI registry 

   1. A tv:URI should identify a television broadcast, i.e. 

      - it should be television. That is, the content has combined 
        audio and video components. This would include world-wide, 
        national and local television stations, but it would exclude 
        radio broadcast and silent webcam transmissions. 

      - it should be broadcast. That is, the content can be received by 
        multiple television watchers in real-time. This includes all 
        types of analog and digital television broadcasts, like 
        terrestrial broadcasts, satellite broadcasts, cable broadcast, 
        IP television and web TV. A broadcast does not to be available 
        24 hours per day, 7 days in a week, to be allowed for 
        registration. It would exclude recorded video content and video 
        phone communication.

Internet-Draft           Registry for tv:URIs                 June 2007 
    

   2. The new registration should not duplicate an existing 
      registration, i.e. it should not refer to the same television 
      broadcast as one that has already been registered. Time-zone 
      dependent television broadcasts are considered different 
      broadcasts in this document (as in [RFC2838]). For instance 
      tv:west.hbo.com versus tv:east.hbo.com. 

   3. The registration should not violate any trademark law. Such a 
      violation could occur if the owner of a DNS domain name objects to 
      reusing that domain name for a tv:URI registration. 

7. Procedures for dispute resolution of claiming a tv:URI 

   Disputes may occur on conflicting registrations for tv:URI's, in the 
   sense that two nominees may want to use the same tv:URI for different 
   television broadcasts (similar to the conflicts about domain names). 
   In such cases, the registry will consult the owner of the television 
   broadcast and ask for advice. If the owner of the broadcast has a 
   clear preference, then the registry will follow this preference. If 
   the owner cannot be reached, or the owner has no opinion, then the 
   registry will make a decision itself. If the dispute is about the 
   ownership of a domain name, which is used in a tv:URI, then the DNS 
   system (whois database) is used for guidance. Ultimately, suspected 
   trademark violations may be challenged in court. 

8. Relation with existing registries 

8.1. Relation with the Domain Name System 

   The tv:URI has no direct relationship with the internet Domain Name 
   System. tv:URIs are not resolvable by the domain name system,  

8.2. Relation with the ShowView/VideoPlus+ system 

   ShowView/VideoPlus+ is a proprietary system that identifies 
   television broadcasts for the purpose of programming video recorders 
   [ShwVw]. Showview/VideoPlus+ is mainly used in Europe and showview 
   numbers are only nationally significant. 

   The registration of a tv:URI may contain references to 
   ShowView/VideoPlus+ numbers in the identification record. 
   Showview/VideoPlus+ numbers shall not be incorporated in a tv:URI 
   itself.

9. Security Considerations 

   As any person or organization can nominate a television broadcast for 
   inclusion in, update of, or deletion from the tv:URI registry, there 
   are no specific security considerations in the nomination process. 

   The registry itself and the website showing the registrations should 
   be protected again unauthorized modifications. The only authorized 
   modifications are those authorized by the registry itself. 

10. IANA Considerations 

   This document does not have IANA considerations. Note that the tv:URI 
   scheme itself needs to be registered by IANA, but that this document 
   is concerned about registration of tv:URI values, not about the 
   registration of the tv:URI scheme itself.
