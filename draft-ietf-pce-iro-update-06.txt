 Update to Include Route Object (IRO) specification in Path Computation
                 Element communication Protocol (PCEP)
                      draft-ietf-pce-iro-update-06

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   for communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE,
   or between two PCEs.  RFC 5440 defines the Include Route Object (IRO)
   to specify network elements to be traversed in the computed path.
   The specification did not specify if the IRO contains an ordered or
   un-ordered list of sub-objects.  During recent discussions, it was
   determined that there was a need to define a standard representation
   to ensure interoperability.

   An informal survey was conducted to determine the state of current
   and planned implementations with respect to IRO ordering and the
   handling of an attribute of the IRO's sub-object, the Loose hop bit
   (L bit).

   This document updates RFC 5440 regarding the IRO specification, based
   on the survey conclusion and recommendation.

1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   for communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE,
   or between two PCEs.  [RFC5440] defines the Include Route Object
   (IRO) to specify network elements to be traversed in the computed

   path.  The specification did not define if the IRO is an ordered or
   un-ordered list of sub-objects.  In addition, it defined the Loose
   hop bit (L bit) to have no meaning within an IRO.

   [RFC5441] describes the use of IRO to indicate the sequence of
   domains to be traversed during inter-domain path computation.

   During recent discussions, it was determined that there was a need to
   define a standard representation to ensure interoperability.  In
   order to understand the current usage amongst implementations, a
   survey of existing and planned implementations was conducted.  This
   survey was informal and conducted via email.  Responses were
   collected and anonymized by the PCE working group chair.

   This document updates the IRO specifications in section 7.12 of
   [RFC5440] as per the conclusion of the survey.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Update in IRO specification

   Section 7.12 of [RFC5440] describes the IRO as an optional object
   used to specify a set of network elements to be traversed in the
   computed path.  It stated that the Loose hop bit (L bit) in the sub-
   object has no meaning within an IRO.  It did not mention if the IRO
   contains an ordered or un-ordered list of sub-objects.

   A survey of the existing and planned implementations was conducted in
   order to understand the current state of usage amongst
   implementations.

   The survey found that most implementations construct or interpret the
   IRO in an ordered fashion and consider it to be an ordered list.
   More than half of implementations interpreted the IRO sub-objects as
   strict hops, others interpreted as loose or supported both
   interpretation.  The results shown in this survey found that most
   implementations support updating [RFC5440] to specify the IRO as an
   ordered list and supported the use of the Loose hop bit (L bit) such
   that both strict and loose hops could be supported in the IRO.

Internet-Draft                 IRO-UPDATE                     March 2016


2.1.  Update to RFC 5440

   Section 7.12 of [RFC5440] regarding the IRO specification is updated
   to remove the last line in the section 7.12 of [RFC5440], that states

      - 'The L bit of such sub-object has no meaning within an IRO.'

   Further, the Section 7.12 of [RFC5440] is updated to add the
   following two statements -

   - The content of IRO is an ordered list of sub-objects representing a
   series of abstract nodes.  An abstract node could be a simple
   abstract node comprising one node or a group of nodes, for example an
   AS (comprising of multiple hops within the AS) (refer section 4.3.2
   of [RFC3209]).

   - The L Bit of IRO sub-object is set based on the loose or strict hop
   property of the sub-object, it is set if the sub-object represents a
   loose hop.  If the bit is not set, the sub-object represents a strict
   hop.  The interpretation of Loose bit (L bit) is as per section
   4.3.3.1 of [RFC3209].

3.  Other Considerations

   Based on the survey, it should be noted that most implementations
   already support this update in the IRO specification.  The other
   implementations are expected to make an update to the IRO procedures
   based on this document.

   During the survey, it was also noted that a minority of the
   implementations, interpreted the IRO sub-objects as loose.  When
   these implementations interwork with an implementation conforming to
   this document, the following impact might be seen -

   o  If a non-conforming (to this document) PCC sends an IRO, to a
      conforming (to this document) PCE, then the PCE may unexpectedly
      fail to find a path (since the PCC may think of IRO sub-objects as
      loose hops, but the PCE interprets them as strict hops).

   o  If a conforming PCC sends an IRO containing strict hops to a non-
      conforming PCE, then the PCE may erroneously return a path that
      does not comply with the requested strict hops (since the PCE
      interprets them all as loose hops).  The PCC may check the
      returned path and find the issue or it may end up using an
      incorrect path.

   Thus it is RECOMMENDED that network operators ensure that all PCEP
   speakers in their network conform to this document if they intend to
   use IRO.

4.  Security Considerations

   This update in IRO specification does not introduce any new security
   considerations, apart from those mentioned in [RFC5440].
   Clarification in the supported IRO ordering or Loose hop bit handling
   will not have any negative security impact.

   It is worth noting that PCEP operates over TCP.  An analysis of the
   security issues for routing protocols that use TCP (including PCEP)
   is provided in [RFC6952].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests to IANA for action.
