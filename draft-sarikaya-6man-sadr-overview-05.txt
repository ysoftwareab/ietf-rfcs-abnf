1.  Introduction

   BCP 38 recommends ingress traffic routing to prohibit Denial of
   Service (DoS) attacks, i.e. datagrams which have source addresses
   that do not match with the network where the host is attached are
   discarded [RFC2827].  Avoiding packets to be dropped because of
   ingress filtering is difficult especially in multihomed networks
   where the host receives more than one prefix from the connected
   Internet Service Providers (ISP) and may have more than one source
   addresses.  Based on BCP 38, BCP 84 introduced recommendations on the
   routing system for multihomed networks [RFC3704].

   Recommendations on the routing system for ingress filtering such as
   in BCP 84 inevitably involve source address checks.  This leads us to
   the source address dependent routing.  Source address dependent
   routing is an issue especially when the host is connected to a
   multihomed network and is communicating with another host in another
   multihomed network.  In such a case, the communication can be broken
   in both directions if ISPs apply ingress filtering and the datagrams
   contain wrong source addresses
   [I-D.huitema-multi6-ingress-filtering].

   Hosts with simultaneously active interfaces receive multiple prefixes
   and have multiple source addresses.  Datagrams originating from such
   hosts carry greats risks to be dropped due to ingress filtering.
   Source address selection algorithm needs to be careful to try to
   avoid ingress filtering on the next-hop router [RFC6724].

   Many use cases have been reported for source/destination routing in
   [I-D.baker-rtgwg-src-dst-routing-use-cases].  These use cases clearly
   indicate that the multihomed host or Customer Premises Equipment
   (CPE) router needs to be configured with correct source prefixes/
   addresses so that it can route packets upstream correctly to avoid
   ingress filtering applied by an upstream ISP to drop the packets.

   In multihomed networks there is a need to do source address based
   routing if some providers are performing the ingress filtering
   defined in BCP38 [RFC2827].  This requires the routers to consider
   the source addresses as well as the destination addresses in
   determining the next hop to send the packet to.

   Based on the use cases defined in
   [I-D.baker-rtgwg-src-dst-routing-use-cases], the routers may be
   informed about the source addresses to use in routing using
   extensions to the routing protocols like IS-IS defined in
   [ISO.10589.1992] [I-D.baker-ipv6-isis-dst-src-routing] and OSPF
   defined in [RFC5340] [I-D.baker-ipv6-ospf-dst-src-routing].  In this
   document we describe the use cases for source address dependent
   routing from the host perspective.

   There are two cases.  A host may have a single interface with
   multiple addresses (from different prefixes or /64s).  Each address
   or prefix is connected to or coming from different exit routers, and
   this case can be called multi-prefix multihoming (MPMH).  A host may
   have simultaneously connected multiple interfaces where each
   interface is connected to a different exit router and this case can
   be called multi-prefix multiple interface (MPMI).

   It should be noted that Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT)
   [RFC3022] in IPv4 and IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6)
   [RFC6296] in IPv6 implement the functions of source address selection
   and next-hop resolution and as such they address multihoming (and
   hosts with multiple interfaces) requirements arising from source
   address dependent routing [RFC7157].  In this case, the gateway
   router or CPE router does the source address and next hop selection
   for all the hosts connected to the router.  However, for end-to-end
   connectivity, NAPT and NPTv6 should be avoided and because of this,
   NAPT and NPTv6 are left out of scope in this document.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  SADR Scenarios

   Source address dependent routing can be facilitated at the host with
   proper next hop and source address selection.  For this, each router
   connected to different interfaces of the host uses Router
   Advertisements to distribute default route, next hop as well as
   source address/prefix information to the host.

   The use case shown in Figure 1 is multi-prefix multi interface use
   case where rtr1 and rtr2 represent customer premises equipment/
   routers (CPE) and there are exit routers in both network 1 and
   network 2.  The issue in this case is ingress filtering.  If the
   packets from the host communicating with a remote destination are
   routed to the wrong exit router, i.e. carry wrong source address,
   they will get dropped.

          Figure 1: multiple Interfaced Host with Two CPE Routers

   Our next use case is shown in Figure 2.  This use case is a multi-
   prefix multihoming use case. rtr is CPE router which is connected to
   two ISPs each advertising their own prefixes.  In this case, the host
   may have a single interface but it receives multiple prefixes from
   the connected ISPs.  Assuming that ISPs apply ingress filtering
   policy the packets for any external communication from the host
   should follow source address dependent routing in order to avoid
   getting dropped.

   A variation of this use case is specialized egress routing.  Upstream
   networks offer different services with specific requirements, e.g.
   video service.  The hosts using this service need to use the
   service's source and destination addresses.  No other service will
   accept this source address, i.e. those packets will be dropped
   [I-D.baker-rtgwg-src-dst-routing-use-cases].

   Next use case is shown in Figure 3.  It is a variation of multi-
   prefix multi interface use case above. rtr1, rtr2 and rtr3 are CPE
   Routers.  The networks apply ingress routing.  Source address
   dependent routing should be used to avoid any external communications

   In the homenet scenario given in Figure 4, representing a simple home
   network, there is a host connected to two CPEs which are connected to
   ISP1 and ISP2, respectively.  Each ISP provides a different prefix.
   Also each router provides a different prefix to the host.  The issue
   in this scenario is also ingress filtering used by each ISP.

   The host has to select the source address from the prefixes of ISP1
   or ISP2 when communicating with other hosts in ISP1 or ISP2.  The
   next issue is to select the correct next hop router, rtr1 or rtr2
   that can reach the right ISP, ISP1 or ISP2.

   The last use case in Figure 5 is also a variation of multi-prefix
   multihoming use case above.  In this case rtrE is connected to two
   ISPs.  All ISPs are assumed to apply ingress routing.  The host
   receives prefixes from each ISP and starts communicating with

   external hosts, e.g.  H1, H2, etc.  H1 and H2 may be accessible both
   from ISP1 and ISP3.

   The host receives multiple provider-allocated IPv6 address prefixes,
   e.g.  P1, P2 and P3 for ISP1, ISP2 and ISP3 and supports shim6
   protocol [RFC5533]. rtr is a CPE router and the default router for
   the host. rtr receives OSPF routes and has a default route for rtrE
   and rtrF.

4.  Analysis of Source Address Dependent Routing

   In this section we present an analysis of the scenarios of Section 3
   and then discuss the relevance of SADR to the provisioning domains.

4.1.  Scenarios Analysis

   As in [RFC7157] we assume that the routers in Section 3 use Router
   Advertisements to distribute default route, next hop and source
   address prefixes supported in each next hop to the hosts or the
   gateway/CPE router relayes this information to the hosts.

   Referring to the scenario in Figure 1, source address dependent
   routing can present a solution to the problem of the host wishes to
   reach a destination in network 2 and the host may choose rtr1 as the
   default router.  The solution should start with the correct
   configuration of the host.  The host should be configured with the
   next hop addresses and the prefixes supported in these next hops.
   This way the host having received many prefixes will have the correct
   knowledge in selecting the right source address and next hop when
   sending packets to remote destinations.

   Note that similar considerations apply to the scenario in Figure 3.

   In the configuration of the scenario in Figure 2 also it is useful to
   configure the host with the next hop addresses and the prefixes and
   source address prefixes they support.  This will enable the host to
   select the right prefix when sending packets to the right next hop
   and avoid any ingress filtering.

   Source address dependent routing in the use case of specialized
   egress routing may work as follows.  The specialized service router
   advertizes one or more specific prefixes with appropriate source
   prefixes, e.g. to the CPE Router, rtr in Figure 2.  The CPE router in
   turn advertizes the specific service's prefixes and source prefixes
   to the host.  This will allow proper configuration at the host so
   that the host can use the service by sending the packets with the
   correct source and destination addresses.

Internet-Draft                    SADR                     February 2015


   Let us analyze the use case in Figure 4.  If a source address
   dependent routing protocol is used, the two routers (rtr1 and rtr2)
   are both able to route traffic correctly, no matter which next-hop
   router and source address the host selects.  In case the host chooses
   the wrong next hop router, e.g. for ISP2 rtr1 is selected, rtr1 will
   forward the traffic to rtr2 to be sent to ISP2 and no ingress
   filtering will happen.

   Note that home networks are expected to comply with requirements for
   source address dependent routing and the routers will be configured
   accordingly, no matter which routing protocol, e.g.  OSPF is used
   [I-D.ietf-homenet-hncp].

   This would work but with issues.  The host traffic to ISP2 will have
   to go over two links instead of one, i.e. the link bandwidth will be
   halved.  Another possibility is rtr1 can send an ICMPv6 Redirect
   message to the host to direct the traffic to rtr2.  Host would
   redirect ISP2 traffic to rtr2.

   The problem with redirects is that ICMPv6 Redirect message can only
   convey two addresses, i.e. in this case the router address, or rtr2
   address and the destination address, or the destination host in ISP2.
   That means the source address will not be communicated.  As a result,
   the host would send packets to the same destination using both source
   addresses which causes rtr2 to send a redirect message to rtr1,
   resulting in ping-pong redirects sent by rtr1 and rtr2.

   The best solution to these issues is to configure the host with both
   the next hop and the source address prefixes that the next hop
   supports.  In homenets, each interface of the host can be configured
   by its next hop, so that all that is needed is to add the information
   on source address prefixes.  This results in the hosts to select the
   right router no matter what.

   Finally, the use case in Figure 5 shows that even though all the
   routers may have source address dependent routing support, the
   packets still may get dropped.

   The host in Figure 5 starts external communication with H1 and sends
   the first packet with source address P3::iid.  Since rtr has a
   default route to rtrE it will use this default route in sending the
   host's packet out towards rtrE. rtrE will route this packet to ISP1
   and the packet will be dropped due to the ingress filtering.

   A solution to this issue could be that rtrE having multiple routes to
   H1 could use the path through rtrF and could direct the packet to the
   other route, i.e. rtrF which would reach H1 in ISP3 without being

   subject to ingress routing
   [I-D.baker-6man-multiprefix-default-route].

4.2.  Provisioning Domains and SADR

   Consistent set of network configuration information is called
   provisioning domain (PvD).  In case of multi-prefix multihoming
   (MPMH), more than one provisioning domain is present on a single
   link.  In case of multi-prefix multiple interface (MPMI)
   environments, elements of the same domain may be present on multiple
   links.  PvD aware nodes support association of configuration
   information into PvDs and use these PvDs to serve requests for
   network connections, e.g. chosing the right source address for the
   packets.  PvDs can be constructed from one of more DHCP or Router
   Advertisement (RA) options carrying such information as PvD identity
   and PvD container [I-D.ietf-mif-mpvd-ndp-support],
   [I-D.ietf-mif-mpvd-dhcp-support].  PvDs constructed based on such
   information are called explicit PvDs [I-D.ietf-mif-mpvd-arch].

   Apart from PvD identity, PvD content may be encapsulated in separate
   RA or DHCP options called PvD Container Option.  Examples of such
   content are defined in [I-D.sarikaya-6man-next-hop-ra] and
   [I-D.sarikaya-dhc-6man-dhcpv6-sadr].  They constitute the content or
   parts of the content of an explicit PvD.

   Explicit PvDs may be received from different interfaces.  Single PvD
   may be accessible over one interface or simulatenously accessible
   over multiple interfaces.  Explicit PvDs may be scoped to a
   configuration related to a particular interface, however in general
   this may not apply.  What matters is PvD ID provided that PvD ID is
   authenticated by the node even in cases where the node has a single
   connected interface.  The authentication of the PvD ID should meet
   the level required by the node policy.  Single PvD information may be
   received over multiple interfaces as long as PvD ID is the same.
   This applies to the router advertisements (RAs) in which case a
   multi-homed host (that is, with multiple interfaces) should trust a
   message from a router on one interface to install a route to a
   different router on another interface.

5.  Guidelines on Standardization Work

   We presented many topologies in which a host with multiple interfaces
   or a multihomed host is connected to various networks or ISPs which
   in turn may apply ingress routing.  Our scenario analysis showed that
   in order to avoid packets getting dropped due to ingress routing,
   source address dependent routing is needed.  Also, source address
   dependent routing should be supported by routers throughout a site
   that has multiple exits.

   In this section, we provide informative guidelines on different
   existing and future solutions vis a vis the scenarios presented in
   Section 3.  We start with source address selection rule 5.5 and the
   scenarios it solves and continue with solutions that state exactly
   what information hosts need in terms of new router advertisement
   options for correct source address selection in those scenarios.

5.1.  Source Address Selection Rule 5.5

   One possible solution is the default source address selection Rule
   5.5 in [RFC6724] which recommends to select source addresses
   advertized by the next hop.  Considering the above scenarios, we can
   state that this rule can solve the problem in Figure 1, Figure 2 and
   Figure 3.

   In using Rule 5.5 the following guidelines should be kept in mind.
   Source address selection rules can be distributed by DHCP server
   using DHCP Option OPTION_ADDRSEL_TABLE defined in [RFC7078].

   In case of DHCP based host configuration, DHCP server can configure
   only the interface of the host to which it is directly connected.  In
   order for Rule 5.5 to apply on other interfaces the option should be
   sent on those interfaces as well using [RFC7078].

   The default source address selection Rule 5.5 solves that problem
   when an application sends a packet with an unspecified source
   address.  In the presence of two default routes, one route will be
   chosen, and Rule 5.5 will make sure the right source address is used.

   When the application selects a source address, i.e. the source
   address is chosen before next-hop selection, even though the source
   address is a way for the application to select the exit point, in
   this case that purpose will not be served.  In the presence of
   multiple default routes, one will be picked, ignoring the source
   address which was selected by the application because it is known
   that IPv6 implementations are not required to remember which next-
   hops advertised which prefixes.  Therefore, the next-hop router may
   not be the correct one, and the packets may be filtered.

   This implies that the hosts should register which next-hop router
   announced each prefix.

5.2.  Router Advertisement Option

   There is a need to configure the host not only with the next hops and
   their prefixes but also with the source prefixes they support.  Such
   a configuration may avoid the host getting ingress/egress policy
   error messages such as ICMP source address failure message.

   If host configuration is done using router advertisement messages
   then there is a need to define new router advertisement options for
   source address dependent routing.  These options include Route Prefix
   with Source Address/Prefix Option.  Other options such as Next Hop
   Address with Route Prefix option and Next Hop Address with Source
   Address and Route Prefix option will be considered in Section 5.3.

   As we observed in Section 4.1, the scenario in Figure 4 can be solved
   by defining a new router advertisement option, i.e.  Route Prefix
   with Source Address/Prefix Option as defined in Section 13 in
   [I-D.sarikaya-6man-next-hop-ra].

   If host configuration is done using DHCP then there is a need to
   define new DHCP options for Route Prefix with Source Address/Prefix.
   As mentioned above, DHCP server configuration is interface specific.
   New DHCP options for source address dependent routing such as route
   prefix and source prefix need to be configured for each interface
   separately.

   The scenario in Figure 4 can be solved by defining a new DHCP option,
   i.e.  Route Prefix with Source Address/Prefix Option, if DHCP
   configuration is a must.

5.3.  Router Advertisement Option Set

   The source address selection rule 5.5 may possibly be a solution for
   selecting the right source addresses for each next hop but there are
   cases where the next hop routers on each interface of the host are
   not known by the host initially.  A typical use case is the Virtual
   Private Network (VPN) access.  The host in VPN access is configured
   by the VPN router which should also give the information on the next
   hop routers and host needs to solicit the router advertisment using
   RS/RA exchange.

   The solution then calls for configuring hosts with Next Hop Addresses
   and the Route Prefix, Source Address/Prefixes that they support.  A
   set of new router advertisement options as in
   [I-D.sarikaya-6man-next-hop-ra] needs to be defined.

   The guideline for this solution is that routers in the whole site
   should be configured to provide the correct configuration information
   to the hosts.  This may result is fate sharing in which one router,
   e.g.  VPN router failure may effect the whole system.  In order to
   avoid such failures, the availability and reliability of routing
   paths need to be provided using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol
   (VRRP) which is widely deployed in industry.

   Additional guideline for this solution is that regular router
   operation calls for unsolicited router advertisements which are
   commonly available in shared links.  Also this type of operation does
   not require inter router communication and thus avoids the fate
   sharing, i.e. each router can autonomously operate independent of
   other routers.

   If host configuration is done using DHCP then there is a need to
   define new DHCP options for Next Hop Address, Route Prefix with
   Source Address/Prefix.  Since DHCP server configuration is interface
   specific, new DHCP options for source address dependent routing such
   as next hop address, route prefix and source prefix need to be
   configured for each interface separately.

   The scenarios in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 as well as
   the ones involving the next hop addresses can be solved by defining
   new DHCP options as in [I-D.sarikaya-dhc-6man-dhcpv6-sadr].

5.4.  Other Solutions

   So far we have singled out the scenario in Figure 5.  All the above
   solutions do not work in this case.  This brings us the issue of IP
   path probing [I-D.naderi-ipv6-probing].

   For a given destination, the host selects a source address and a next
   hop and sends its packet.  When the selected path fails, in case of
   IP probing, the host can probe all available paths until finding one
   that works.

   The guideline in probing is Source Address Dependent Routing (SADR)
   should be used, i.e. it is a necessary tool.  Basically, SADR saves
   time in eliminating wrong paths, i.e. sending the packets to the
   wrong exit router.  If SADR is not taken into account correctly the
   host will end up wasting resources trying to explore paths that are
   certain to fail.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document describes some use cases and thus brings no new
   security risks to the Internet.

7.  IANA Considerations

   None.
