             Requirements for a Zero-Configuration IPv6 CPE
                 draft-baker-v6ops-cpe-autoconfigure-00

Abstract

   This note is a breif exploration of what is required for a CPE to be
   auto-configurable from the perspective on an ISP or other upstream
   network.  It assumes that the CPE may also be IPv4-capable (probably
   using NAPT), but that the requirements for that are well understood
   and need no further specification.

1.  Introduction

   We observe that, in today's offerings, "IPv6-capable" has many
   different meanings.  These often require specific configuration and
   are non-interoperable.

   The objective is to enable a customer to purchase a CPE router from a
   mass market store, or for an ISP to purchase CPE Routers for its
   managed service offering, that implement IPv6 [RFC2460] and can be
   attached to any residential/SOHO network and any ISP or other
   upstream network "as is out of the box", and work correctly.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Operational Requirements

   The goal stated in Section 1 requires that downstream, which is to
   say within the home or SOHO , the CPE must presume that there may
   exist systems that will autoconfigure [RFC4862] themselves using
   information in a Router Advertisement [RFC4861], and that there may
   exist systems that require address assignment using DHCPv6 [RFC3315].
   It may offer a DNS service using a provider such as OpenDNS, Google
   Public DNS, Amazon Route 53, or some other such service, or relay the
   address of an ISP-provided DNS server.

   Similarly, the stated goal requires that upstream, the CPE must
   presume that it will be required to solicit and observe a Router
   Advertisement [RFC4861], and

   o  learn an upstream DHCPv6 server address,

   o  either autoconfigure [RFC4862] its upstream address or derive one
      using DHCPv6 [RFC3315],

   o  potentially learn an DNS server address from an RDNSS [RFC4339] or
      from DHCPv6,

   o  and allocate IPv6 /64 prefixes for each of its interior subnets
      using the IPv6 Prefix Options for DHCP [RFC3633].

   Given that, it is in a position to offer IPv6 services in the
   residential/SOHO network depending on the upstream IPv6 capabilities.

3.  Expected Behavior

   As a result, a CPE needs to perform several steps, and come out of
   the box configured to do so.  These include:

   1.  Upon detecting the upstream interface as "up", emit a Router
       Solicitation [RFC4861] on it.

   2.  If it receives a Router Advertisement [RFC4861], verify its
       contents.  These may include:

       *  If the RA contains a valid Prefix Information Option whose
          prefix is available for autoconfiguration, create an address
          in that prefix for that interface as specified in SLAAC
          [RFC4862].

       *  Failing that, use DHCPv6 [RFC3315] to request an address from
          the upstream network.

       *  In that same DHCP request, it MAY request an IA_PD [RFC3633]
          delegation of a set of prefixes as described in Section 4.

   3.  If it has not already done so, the router should request an IA_PD
       [RFC3633] delegation of a set of prefixes as described in
       Section 4.

   4.  Given an upstream interface and a delegation of prefixes to use
       downstream, it should

       *  subdelegate a /64 prefix to each downstream interface

       *  allocate an address to each downstream interface using the
          relevant prefixes

       *  start announcing a periodic RA on each downstream interface.
          This RA should include, in addition to usual information
          elements, the RDNSS [RFC4339].

4.  Prefix Delegation

   When the CPE requests a set of prefixes from its upstream network,
   there are several conditions that may apply:

   o  [RFC4291] and [RFC7421] presume a /64 prefix on each IPv6 subnet.

   o  Each LAN to which the CPE connects may be presumed to require a
      subnet - if not immediately, at some point in the future.

   o  There may be LANs in the residential/SOHO network that are not
      attached to the CPE, but require subdelegation within the network
      using DHCPv6 or HNCP [RFC7788].

   The IA_PD requests a prefix, and indicates its preference for a
   "Length for this prefix in bits".  By nature, this is exponential: if
   a home requires 17 subnets, it will require the prefix to be no
   longer than 59 bits, and therefore technically requesting at least 32
   /64 prefixes.  In fact, some ISPs have stated privately that they
   actually allocate prefix lengths of 56, 60, or 64 (and therefore sets
   of 256, 16, or 1 /64) depending on the CPE's request.

   The CPE should request as many as it thinks it might need, including
   interior sub-delegation if it has an idea of what that may require.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo asks the IANA for no new parameters.

6.  Security Considerations

   This note describes the use of existing features, each of which has
   its own Security Considerations, and as such adds no new security
   vulnerabilities.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   This memo calls for no personally identifiable information.  The data
   conveyed may, however, be correlatable with other data that is
   personally identifiable.  Such things are beyond the scope of this
   document.
