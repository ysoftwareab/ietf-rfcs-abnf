Abstract

   This Internet-Draft proposes an extension to SMTP for an electronic
   mail equivalent to the real-world "No Soliciting" sign. In addition
   to the service extension, a new message header and extensions to the
   existing "received" message header are described.

Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

1. Introduction

1.1 The Spam Pandemic

   Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE), otherwise known as spam, has become as
   one of the most pressing issues on the Internet.  One oft-quoted
   study estimated that spam would cost businesses $13 billion in
   2003.[Ferris] In April 2003, AOL reported that it had blocked 2.37
   billion pieces of UBE in a single day. [CNET] And, in a sure sign
   that UBE has become of pressing concern, numerous politicians have
   begun to issue pronouncements and prescriptions for fighting this
   epidemic.[Schumer][FTC]

   A variety of mechanisms from the technical community have been
   proposed and/or implemented to fight UBE:

   o  Whitelists are lists of known non-spammers.  For example, Habeas,
      Inc. maintains a Habeas User List (HUL) of people who have agreed
      to not spam.  By including a haiku in email headers and enforcing
      copyright on that ditty, they enforce their anti-spamming terms of
      service. [Habeas]

   o  Blacklists are lists of known spammers or ISPs that allow
      spam.[ROSKO]

   o  Spam filters run client-side or server-side to filter out spam
      based on whitelists, blacklists, and textual and header
      analysis.[Assassin]

   o  A large number of documents address the overall technical
      considerations for the control of UBE
      [I-D.crocker-spam-techconsider], operational considerations for
      SMTP agents[RFC2505], and various extensions to the protocols to
      support UBE identification and filtering.
      [I-D.danisch-dns-rr-smtp][I-D.daboo-sieve-spamtest][I-D.crouzet-amtp]

   o  Various proposals have been advanced for "do not spam" lists, akin
      to the Federal Trade Commission's "Do Not Call" list for
      telemarketers.[FTC.TSR]


1.2 No Soliciting in the Real World

   Municipalities frequently require solicitors to register with the
   town government.  And, in many cases, the municipalities prohibit
   soliciting in residences where the occupant has posted a sign.  The
   town of West Newbury, Massachusetts, for example, requires:




Malamud                  Expires July 24, 2004                  [Page 3]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                   January 2004


      "It shall be unlawful for any canvasser or solicitor to enter the
      premises of a resident or business who has displayed a 'No
      Trespassing' or 'No Soliciting' sign or poster.  Further, it shall
      be unlawful for canvassers or solicitors to ignore a resident or
      business person's no solicitation directive or remain on private
      property after its owner has indicated that the canvasser or
      solicitor is not welcome." [Newbury]

   Registration requirements for solicitors, particularly those
   soliciting for political or religious reasons, have been the subject
   of a long string of court cases.  However, the courts have generally
   recognized that individuals may post "No Soliciting" signs and the
   government may enforce the citizen's desire. In a recent case where
   Jehovah's Witnesses challenged a registration requirement in the city
   of Stratton, Connecticut, saying they derived their authority from
   the Scriptures, not the city.  However, the court noted:

      "A section of the ordinance that petitioners do not challenge
      establishes a procedure by which a resident may prohibit
      solicitation even by holders of permits. If the resident files a
      'No Solicitation Registration Form' with the mayor, and also posts
      a 'No Solicitation' sign on his property, no uninvited canvassers
      may enter his property ..." [Watchtower]

   Even government, which has a duty to promote free expression, may
   restrict the use of soliciting on government property. In one case,
   for example, a school district was allowed to give access to its
   internal electronic mail system to the union that was representing
   teachers, but was not required to do so to a rival union that was
   attempting to gain the right to represent the teachers.  The court
   held that where property is not a traditional public forum "and the
   Government has not dedicated its property to First Amendment
   activity, such regulation is examined only for
   reasonableness."[Perry]

   The courts have consistently held that the state has a compelling
   public safety reason for regulating solicitation.  In Cantwell v.
   Connecticut, the Supreme Court held that "a State may protect its
   citizens from fraudulent solicitation by requiring a stranger in the
   community, before permitting him publicly to solicit funds for any
   purpose, to establish his identity and his authority to act for the
   cause which he purports to represent."[Cantwell] And, in Martin v.
   City of Struthers, the court noted that "burglars frequently pose as
   canvassers, either in order that they may have a pretense to discover
   whether a house is empty and hence ripe for burglary, or for the
   purpose of spying out the premises in order that they may return
   later."[Martin] The public safety issue applies very much to email,
   where viruses can easily be delivered, in contrast to telephone

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                   January 2004


   solicitations where public safety is not nearly as much an issue.

   This analysis is very U.S.-centric, which may be appropriate given
   that the large majority of UBE appears to originate from U.S.
   citizens.  However, the concept of prohibiting unwanted solicitation
   does carry over to other countries:

   o  In Hong Kong, offices frequently post "no soliciting" signs.

   o  In the United Kingdom, where door-to-door peddlers are fairly
      common, "no soliciting" signs are also common.

   o  In Australia, where door-to-door does not appear to be a pressing
      social problem, there was legislation passed which outlawed the
      practice of placing ads under wipers of parked cars.

   o  In France, which has a long tradition of door-to-door
      solicitation, apartment buildings often use trespass laws to
      enforce "no solicitation" policies.

   o  In the Netherlands, where door-to-door solicitation is not a
      pressing issue, there is a practice of depositing free
      publications in mailboxes.  The postal equivalent of "no spam"
      signs are quite prevalent and serve notice that the publications
      are not desired.


1.3 A Distributed No Soliciting Extension

   Many of the anti-spam proposals that have been advanced have great
   merit, however none of them give notice to an SMTP agent in the
   process of delivering mail that the receiver does not wish to receive
   solicitations. Such a virtual sign would serve two purposes:

   o  It would allow the receiving system to "serve notice" that a
      certain class of electronic mail is not desired, whether or not
      such a message is properly identified as belonging to that class.

   o  If a message is properly identified as belonging to a certain
      class and that class of messages is not desired, transfer of the
      message can be eliminated.  Rather than filtering after delivery,
      elimination of the message transfer can save network bandwidth,
      disk space, and processing power.

   This memo details a series of extensions to SMTP that have the
   following characteristics:

   o  A service extension is described that allows a receiving Mail



Malamud                  Expires July 24, 2004                  [Page 5]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                   January 2004


      Transport Agent (MTA) to signal the sending MTA that no soliciting
      is in effect.

   o  A header field for the sender of the message is defined that
      allows the sender to flag a message as conforming to a certain
      class.

   o  Trace fields for intermediate MTAs are extended to allow the
      intermediate MTA to signal that a message conforms to a certain
      class.

   Allowing the sender of a message to tag a message as being, for
   example, unsolicited commercial email with adult content, allows
   "good" spammers to conform to legal content labelling requirements by
   governmental authorities or conventions imposed by "whitelist"
   services.  For senders of mail who choose not to abide by these
   conventions, the intermediate trace fields defined here allow the
   destination MTA or a designated intermediate MTA to perform
   appropriate dispositions on the received message.

   This distributed approach to controlling UBE is advanced as an
   alternative to centralized "do-not-spam" lists.  The concluding
   section of this document details how the decentralized approach would
   work in practice and contrasts this approach to a centralized list.

2. The No-Soliciting SMTP Service Extension

   Per [RFC2821], a "NO-SOLICITING" SMTP service extension is defined.
   The service extension is declared during the initial "EHLO" SMTP
   exchange.  The extension has one optional parameter and zero or more
   solicitation class keywords.  Using the notation as described in the
   Augmented BNF[RFC2234], the syntax is:

     No-Soliciting-Service = "NO-SOLICITING"
       ( "SYSTEM-WIDE" [ SP Solicitation-keywords ] )
         / "PER-RECIPIENT" )

   As will be further described below, the "Solicitation-keywords"
   construct is used to indicate which messages are accepted or not.  In
   the case of the "SYSTEM-WIDE" option, this information is indicated
   during the initial "EHLO" exchange. In the case of the
   "PER-RECIPIENT" option, this information is not present in the
   initial exchange and is instead presented as part of the "MAIL-FROM"
   command.

2.1 The SYSTEM-WIDE Option

   "NO-SOLICITING SYSTEM-WIDE" indicates that no soliciting is in effect



Malamud                  Expires July 24, 2004                  [Page 6]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                   January 2004


   for all messages delivered to this system.  It is equivalent to the
   sign on the door of an office building announcing a company-wide
   policy.

   The parameter is presented during the initial exchange between sender
   and receiver:

     R: <wait for connection on TCP port 25>
     S: <open connection to server>
     R: 220 trusted.example.com SMTP service ready
     S: EHLO untrusted.example.com
     R: 250-trusted.example.com says hello
     R: 250-NO-SOLICITING SYSTEM-WIDE ADV

   (The "ADV" keyword is one of several possible values and is described
   in the following section.)

   A similar proposal was advanced in 1999 by John Levine and Paul
   Hoffman.  This proposal used the SMTP greeting banner to specify that
   unsolicited bulk email is prohibited on a particular system through
   the use of the "NO UCE" keyword.[Levine]  As the authors note, their
   proposal has the potential of overloading the semantics of the
   greeting banner, which may also be used for other purposes (see,
   e.g., [Malamud]).

2.2 Solicitation Class Keywords

   The "NO-SOLICITING" service extension uses solicitation class
   keywords to signify classes of solicitations that are not accepted.
   Keywords are separated by commas and follow the "SYSTEM-WIDE"
   parameter.  As described subsequently, solicitation class keywords
   are also used with the "PER-RECIPIENT" variant of this extension as
   well as with the "Solicitation:" and trace field message headers.

   Three solicitation class keywords are defined in this draft:

   Keywords  Description                       Reference
   --------- --------------------------------  ---------
   MAPS-UBE  Unsolicited Bulk Email            http://mail-abuse.org/
   ADV       Unsolicited Commercial Email      http://www.spamlaws.com/
   ADV:ADLT  Sexually Explicit Commercial Mail http://www.spamlaws.com/

   MAPS-UBE is the standard advanced by the Mail Abuse Prevention System
   (MAPS), which states:

      An electronic message is "spam" IF: (1) the recipient's personal
      identity and context are irrelevant because the message is equally
      applicable to many other potential recipients; AND (2) the



Malamud                  Expires July 24, 2004                  [Page 7]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                   January 2004


      recipient has not verifiably granted deliberate, explicit, and
      still-revocable permission for it to be sent; AND (3) the
      transmission and reception of the message appears to the recipient
      to give a disproportionate benefit to the sender.

   Numerous states have adopted the "ADV" and "ADV:ADLT" conventions.
   We cite the spamlaws.com site as a reference because it provides an
   excellent summary of the definitions and pointers to the relevant
   statutes.

   There is no default keyword for the service.  In other words, the
   following example is a "no-op":

     R: 250-NO-SOLICITING SYSTEM-WIDE

   Additional solicitation class keywords may be defined and registered
   as specified in Section 5.3. Multiple solicitation class keywords are
   separated by a comma to form a list:

     Solicitation-keywords = Solicit-word 0*("," Solicit-word)
     Solicit-word = [ "MAPS-UBE" / "ADV" / "ADV:ADLT"
                      / x-word / registered-word ]
     x-word = ["x-" / "X-"] 1*(wordchars)

     registered-word = ALPHA 0*(wordchars)
                                  ; registered-word(s) are registered
                                  ; with the IANA
     wordchars = 1*("-" / "_" / ":" / ALPHA / DIGIT)

   Developers should note that a "registered-word" MAY contain a
   trailing wild card as part of the specification.  See Section 5.3.1
   for more details.

2.2.1 Note on Choice of Keywords

   This document does not specify which keywords shall or shall not be
   used on a particular message.  The requirement to use a particular
   keyword is a policy decision well outside the scope of this document.
   In particular, the three keywords described in this document are for
   illustrative purposes only and it is expected that relevant policy
   bodies (e.g., a government, ISP, or other institution) will specify
   appropriate keywords, the definition of the meaning of those
   keywords, and any other policy requirements, such as a requirement to
   use or not use this extension in particular circumstances.

2.3 The PER-RECIPIENT Option

   The "NO-SOLICITING PER-RECIPIENT" extension specifies that each "MAIL



Malamud                  Expires July 24, 2004                  [Page 8]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                   January 2004


   FROM" command must identify if a message is a solicitation.

   The presence of this extension is identified during the initial
   greeting:

     R: <wait for connection on TCP port 25>
     S: <open connection to server>
     R: 220 trusted.example.com SMTP service ready
     S: EHLO untrusted.example.com
     R: 250-trusted.example.com says hello
     R: 250-NO-SOLICITING PER-RECIPIENT

   Additionally, "SOLICIT" is defined as a parameter for the "MAIL FROM"
   command.  The "SOLICIT" parameter is followed by an optional equal
   sign and a comma separated list of solicitation class keywords.

   The syntax for this parameter is:

     Mail-From-Solicit-Parameter = "SOLICIT"
                             "=" Solicitation-keywords

   Note that white space is not permitted in this production.

   As an informational message, the "550" or "250" replies to the "RCPT
   TO" command may also contain the "SOLICIT" parameter.

   The receiving system may decide on a per-user basis the appropriate
   disposition of messages:

     S: MAIL FROM:<save@burntmail.example.com> SOLICIT=ADV,MAPS-UBE
     S: RCPT TO:<coupon_clipper@moonlink.example.com>
     R: 250 <coupon_clipper@moonlink.example.com>... Recipient ok
     S: RCPT TO:<grumpy_old_boy@moonlink.example.com>
     R: 550 <grumpy_old_boy@moonlink.example.com>... SOLICIT=ADV

   In the previous example, the receiving MTA returned a "550" status
   code, indicating that one message was being rejected.  Note that the
   implementation also echoes back the currently set keywords for that
   user on the "550" error message.

2.4 Use of Enhanced Mail Status Codes

   If a session between two MTAs is using both the "NO-SOLICITING"
   extension and the Enhanced Mail Status Codes as defined in [RFC3463]
   and a message is rejected based on the presence of a "SOLICIT"
   parameter, the correct error message to return is "5.7.1", defined as
   "the sender is not authorized to send to the destination ...
   [because] of per-host or per-recipient filtering."

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                   January 2004


2.5 Solicitation Mail Header

   Per [RFC2822], a new "Solicitation:" header field is defined which
   contains one or more solicitation class keywords.

     To: Coupon Clipper <coupon_clipper@moonlink.example.com>
     From: Spam King <save@burntmail.example.com>
     Solicitation: ADV,ADV:ADLT

   Several proposals, particularly legal ones, have suggested requiring
   the use of keywords in the "Subject:" header. While embedding
   information in the "Subject:" header may provide visual cues to end
   users, it does not provide a straightforward set of cues for computer
   programs such as mail transfer agents. As with embedding a "no
   solicitation" message in a greeting banner, this overloads the
   semantics of the "Subject:" header.  Of course, there is no reason
   why both mechanisms can't be used, and in any case the
   "Solicitation:" header could be automatically inserted by the
   sender's Mail User Agent (MUA) based on the contents of the subject
   line.

2.6 Insertion of Solicitation Keywords in Trace Fields

   The "Solicitation:" mail header is only available to the sending
   client.  RFCs 2821 and 2822 are quite specific that intermediate MTAs
   shall not change message headers, with the sole exception of the
   "Received:" trace field.  Since many current systems use an
   intermediate relay to detect unsolicited mail, an addition to the
   "Received:" header is described.

   [RFC2821] documents the following productions for the "Received:"
   header in a mail message:

     With = "WITH" FWS Protocol CFWS

     Protocol = "ESMTP" / "SMTP" / Attdl-Protocol

   Additionally, [RFC2822] defines a comment field as follows:

     comment         =       "(" *([FWS] ccontent) [FWS] ")"

   Solicitation Keywords are inserted as comments using the following
   production, which is based on the "Mail-From-Solicit-Parameter"
   defined in Section 2.3 above:

     With-Solicit = "WITH" FWS Protocol
                    "(" [FWS] Mail-From-Solicit-Parameter [FWS] ")"

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                   January 2004


   An example of a Received: header from a conforming MTA is as follows:

     Received: by foo-mta.example.com with
        ESMTP (SOLICIT=ADV,ADV:ADLT) ; Sat, 9 Aug 2003
        16:54:42 -0700 (PDT)

   It should be noted that keywords presented in trace fields may not
   agree with those found in the "Solicitation:" header and trace fields
   may exist even if the header is not present. When determing which
   keywords are applicable to a particular exchange of messages,
   implementors SHOULD examine any keywords found in the "Solicitation:"
   header.  Implementors MAY examine other keywords found in the trace
   fields.

2.7 Relay of Messages

   The "NO-SOLICITING SYSTEM-WIDE" service extension, if present,
   applies to all messages handled by the receiving Message Transfer
   Agent (MTA), including those messages intended to be relayed to
   another system.

   When relaying a message which was received in which the "SOLICIT"
   parameter was set on the "MAIL FROM" command, the MTA MUST also set
   the "SOLICIT" parameter when delivering the message to an SMTP server
   that supports this extension.

   The "SOLICIT" parameter on a "MAIL FROM" command can be derived from
   a variety of sources, including receipt of a message from a
   conforming SMTP server. An SMTP server MAY, for operational reasons
   as defined in Section 7.7 of [RFC2821], set this parameter after
   detecting the presence of the "Solicitation:" or extended "Received:"
   message header field or by using other system-specific techniques.

   Implementers should be aware that the "NO-SOLICITING" service
   extension is not a guaranteed end-to-end service.  Specifically,
   intermediate relays that do not support this service may "lose" the
   per-message parameters. However, the "Solicitation:" header and any
   trace fields inserted during the message transfer process will
   persist, and downstream MTAs MAY use this extension when relaying a
   message which was received without this extension.

2.8 Recommendations for Developers and Administrators

   Developers that implement the "NO-SOLICITING" service extension
   SHOULD NOT enable the service as a default.  There are some
   indications that some policy makers may view a default filtering in
   software as a prior restraint on commercial speech. In other words,
   because the person installing the software did not make an explicit



Malamud                  Expires July 24, 2004                 [Page 11]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                   January 2004


   choice to enable a certain type of filtering, some might argue that
   such filtering was not desired.

   Likewise, it is recommended that a system administrator installing
   software SHOULD NOT enable "PER-RECIPIENT" filtering by default for a
   user.  Again, individual users should request the service.

   The mechanism for an individual user to communicate their desire to
   enable certain types of filtering is outside the scope of this
   document.

   It should be noted that for recipient MTAs, implementation of the
   "SYSTEM-WIDE" option is significantly simpler than adding
   "PER-RECIPIENT" capabilities.  Because "PER-RECIPIENT" is an optional
   parameter, it should be noted that:

   o  A conforming sending MTA MUST provide support for both
      "SYSTEM-WIDE" and "PER-RECIPIENT".

   o  A conforming receiving MTA MAY provide support for either
      "SYSTEM-WIDE" or "PER-RECIPIENT" or both.

   Implementation of SYSTEM-WIDE on a receiving MTA is fairly trivial.
   For example, on the popular sendmail [1] package, a few minor changes
   need to be made to three files to provide the appropriate "EHLO"
   announcement.

3. Use of the Extension

   This proposal is not meant to solve the UBE problem, but offers some
   tools that can be used by policy makers, be they governments defining
   laws or Internet Service Providers defining appropriate use policies.
   The service extension allows a mail recipient to notify the sender
   that certain forms of electronic mail are not desired and thus gives
   policy makers a mechanism for requiring senders of such electronic
   mail to identify their missives any penalties for failure to do so.
   To illustrate how the system might work in practice, a simple
   hypothetical scenario is presented.

   Our scenario posits that the U.S. federal government wants to do
   something about spam, but is uncertain about the effectiveness of a
   centralized "do not spam" list.  Instead, they decide to go for a
   more decentralized approach as follows:

   1.  The first step would be for the government to promulgate a
       definition of spam and tie a keyword to that definition.  This
       definition needs to published in a permanent record of some sort
       so that it can be referenced in the following steps.  The



Malamud                  Expires July 24, 2004                 [Page 12]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                   January 2004


       Congressional Record [2] or the Federal Register [3] would both
       be considered adequate for this purpose.  The definition needs to
       include an unambiguous definition of mail covered by the keyword,
       a mechanism for a sender to convey that information, and the
       legal import of the "NO-SOLICITING" notice and any penalties for
       violation thereof.  Let us suppose that the keyword to be
       registered is ""WMA".

   2.  The appropriate authority (e.g., the Clerk of the House [4] or an
       appropriate executive branch official) would register this
       definition with the IANA using the template as described in
       Section 5 and sending the completed template to iana@iana.org
       [5].

   3.  To the extent that a proliferation of keywords and conflicting
       definitions is considered an issue by policy makers, appropriate
       discussions would be held with other countries and the states to
       make definitions consistent.

   4.  Reputable email list maintainers would activate a simple check of
       each address on their lists by connecting to the SMTP port of at
       least one system indicated by an MX record in the Domain Name
       System.  If either the "SYSTEM-WIDE" or "PER-RECIPIENT" service
       extension matches the "WMA" keyword, the address would be
       scrubbed from the list.

   5.  Reputable users of email lists would add a "Solicitation: WMA"
       header to their electronic mail and activate the same simple
       check described in the previous step.  Any addresses matching the
       check would trigger non-delivery of the message and, presumably,
       the scrubbing of that address from the list.

   6.  A system manager, under the guidance of the Administrative
       Contact for a domain, would configure "MX" records in the Domain
       Name System to designate one or more systems authorized to
       receive mail for the domain in question.  For each system so
       designated, the system manager might enable "NO-SOLICITING
       SYSTEM-WIDE WMA". These systems receiving mail on behalf of the
       designated domain might also be configured to run a spam
       identification utility, such as SpamAssasin [6] or SpamBouncer
       [7].

   7.  End users would configure their mail filters to filter out any
       properly tagged messages (e.g., "Solicitation: WMA") and any
       messages that are not properly tagged (e.g., in SpamBouncer, the
       user might set the "SPAMLEVEL" parameter to "10", which would
       filter all messages with a score of 10 or greater using the
       software's own algorithms for the detection of probable spam).

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                   January 2004


   8.  Unagressive end users would simply delete their spam folder
       periodically.  More paranoid end users would check the folder for
       false positives and then delete it.  A few users might take more
       agressive steps.  For example, setting the SpamBouncer
       "SPAMREPLY" to "COMPLAIN" will automatically dispatch complaints
       to ISP abuse lines. If financial penalties for violation of WMA
       tagging provisions exist and include a split between the federal
       authorities and the filer of a complaint, an additional copy of
       the offending mail can be dispatched to a service bureau whose
       function is to aggregate large amounts of spam, find the senders,
       and then file appropriate procedural motions, receiving a portion
       of any recovered monies in return for its efforts.


3.1 Relationship to Centralized Approaches

   The overwhelming success of the "do not call" list for telemarketing
   have prompted a variety of proposals for similar "do not spam" lists.
   Such a list takes a centralized approach to solving the same problem
   addressed by this service extension.  The centralized approach has
   the following potential pitfalls:

   o  From the point of view of the consumer, a centralized list
      operates in batch mode: there is a lag between asserting the
      desire to start or stop receiving a certain type of mail and the
      implementation of that assertion. In addition, placing an email
      address on a centralized list has a significant risk that the list
      will be used by some to send even more unwanted mail.

   o  From the point of view of the government, a centralized list
      requires significant resources to administer and maintain.
      Because the list contains aggregated information, it is more
      valuable to legally irresponsible mailers and thus adequate
      security provisions need to be made for the list contents.

   o  The decentralized approach is cheaper for telemarketers to
      implement. From the point of view of the sender of unsolicited
      mail, the bulk approach requires a significant data processing
      investment to continually "scrub" lists that are received. In
      contrast, the decentralized approach requires a simple pattern
      match on one address at a time.

   It should be noted that the centralized and decentralized approaches
   can coexist in some manner.  A useful analogy is the field of
   copyright.  Documents have an inherent copyright and the legal
   definition of a copyright violation takes into account the degree to
   which the alleged violator knew they were violating the conditions
   imposed by the law.  One common way to assert coypright is through a



Malamud                  Expires July 24, 2004                 [Page 14]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                   January 2004


   mark on the document itself, a decentralized approach to copyright
   assertion.  One can also file a registration with the copyright
   office, which adds an additional presumption that adequate notice has
   been given.

   In the example of spam prevention, there would also be an inherent
   right, the right not to received unsolicited commercial mail.  The
   courts or executive branch, as with copyright, would assess fines
   based on a variety of factors, and the degree of notice could
   certainly be such a factor.  Adding an address to a registry of
   do-not-spam addresses, in conjunction with a real-time
   "NO-SOLICITING" assertion could both be factors taken into
   consideration in levying fines or taking other corrective actions.

4. Security Considerations

   This extension does not provide authentication of senders or other
   measures intended to promote security measures during the message
   exchange process.

   In particular, this document does not address the circumstances under
   which a sender of electronic mail should or should not use this
   extension and does not address the issues of whether consent to send
   mail has been granted.

   This might lead to a scenario in which a sender of electronic mail
   begins to use this extension well before the majority of end users
   have begun to use it.  In this scenario, the sender might wish to use
   the absence of the extension on the receiving MTA as an implication
   of consent to receive mail. Non-use of the "NO-SOLICITING" extension
   by a receiving MTA SHALL NOT indicate consent.

5. IANA Considerations

   There are four IANA considerations presented in this draft:

   1.  Addition of the "NO-SOLICITING" service extension to the Mail
       Parameters registry.

   2.  Documentation of the use of comments in trace fields.

   3.  Creation of a Solicitation Class Keywords registry.

   4.  Creation of a "Solicitation:" mail header, which does not
       currently raise any IANA considerations.

5.1 The Mail Parameters Registry

   The IANA Mail Parameters registry documents SMTP service extensions.
   The "NO-SOLICITATION" service extension would need to be added to
   this registry as follows.

     Keywords        Description                     Reference
     ------------    ------------------------------  ---------
     NO-SOLICITING   Notification of no soliciting.  [<this draft>]

   The parameters subregistry would need to be modified as follows:

     Service Ext      EHLO Keyword   Parameters      Reference
     -----------      ------------   -----------     ---------
     No Soliciting    NO-SOLICITING  SYSTEM-WIDE     [<this draft>]
     No Soliciting    NO-SOLICITING  PER-RECIPIENT   [<this draft>]


5.2 Trace Fields

   The Mail Parameters registry would need to be modified to note the
   use of the comment facility in trace fields to indicate Solicitation
   Class Keywords.

5.3 The Solicitation Class Keywords Registry

   A new registry (or a subregistry of Mail Parameters) would need to be
   established for Solicitation Class Keywords.  The registry would
   contain the following fields:

   1.  Keyword name (e.g., "MAPS-UBE").

   2.  Keyword description (e.g., "Unsolicited Bulk Email").

   3.  Keyword reference (e.g., "<this draft>").

   Per the policies outlined in [RFC2434], it is recommended that the
   IESG request the IANA to appoint a Designated Expert to administer
   this registry.  Authority for solicitation class keywords in this
   registry will come in some cases from published RFCs, but in other
   cases will come from applicable laws or regulations.  It is
   recommended that any non-RFC derived solicitation class keywords be
   documented in future informational RFCs to provide a consistent set
   of references.

5.3.1 Guidance on Keyword Specification

   A set of keywords beginning with a common prefix may be registered



Malamud                  Expires July 24, 2004                 [Page 16]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                   January 2004


   with the IANA by specifying the prefix followed by wild card
   specified as a single asterisk ("*") and shall be considered a single
   registry entry.  The "keyword reference" field of the registry SHOULD
   contain a reference that documents the values this solicitation class
   keyword may contain if the trailing wild card is specified in the
   "keyword name" field of the registry.

      Note to Developers: In designing client and server solutions based
      on this extension, it is important to remember to design your code
      to take into account the possible use of these trailing wildcards.
      See the "Solicitation-keywords" production in Section 2.2 for
      valid characters and delimiters.

   This facility can be used to insert a "score" or category tag by an
   intermediate MTA.  For example, a solicitation class keyword "WMA:*"
   might be used as follows:

     Received: by foo-mta.example.com with
        ESMTP (WMA:SBRule:Haven_Domain,WMA:SBScore:10) ; Sat, 9 Aug 2003
        16:54:42 -0700 (PDT)


5.4 The Solicitation Mail Header

   There is currently no registry defined for mail headers.  If such a
   registry were to exist, the "Solicitation:" header field would need
   to be added to it.

6. Author's Acknowledgements

   The author would like to thank Rebecca Malamud for many discussions
   and ideas that led to this proposal and to John C. Klensin and
   Marshall T. Rose for their extensive input on how it could be
   properly implemented in SMTP.  Eric Allman, Steven M.  Bellovin, Kent
   Crispin, Dave Crocker, Curtis Generous, Paul Hoffman, John Levine,
   Keith Moore, Ned Freed, Paul Vixie, and Pindar Wong kindly provided
   reviews of the draft and/or suggestions for improvement. Information
   about soliciting outside the U.S. was received from Rob Blokzijl, Jon
   Crowcroft, Christian Huitema, Geoff Huston, and Pindar Wong.  John
   Levine pointed out the contrast between this proposal and "do not
   spam" lists.  As always, all errors and omissions are the
   responsibility of the author.

A.4 Changes From Previous Drafts

   Changes from draft-malamud-no-soliciting-03 [9] to
   draft-malamud-no-soliciting-04 [10]:

   o  The Note on Open Issues has been removed and the abstract has been
      made more precise.

   o  All examples now use subdomains of example.com.

   o  The "No-Soliciting-Service" production has been changed to make
      clear that a set of keywords is not presented when the
      "PER-RECIPIENT" option is used. See Section 2.

   o  A Note on Keywords has been added to make clear that the initial
      three keywords choosen were simply to bootstrap the registry and
      that the matter of which keywords to use and the definition of
      those words is a policy decision well outside the scope of this
      document. See Section 2.2.1.

   o  Solicitation Class Keywords are now carried as a comment to the
      "ESMTP" protocol and additional language has been added clarifying
      the relationship of keywords in "received:" headers to those in
      the "Solicitation:" header. See Section 2.6.

   o  Some language has been added to further clarify what should happen
      when dealing with a server that doesn't support the extension. See
      Section 2.7.

   o  The Security Considerations section has been made more explicit.
      See Section 4.

   o  The Solicitation Class Keywords Registry has been clarified to
      permit the use of a trailing wildcard in the "keyword name" field.
      See Section 5.3.

   Changes from draft-malamud-no-soliciting-02 [11] to
   draft-malamud-no-soliciting-03 [12]:

   o  A discussion of Open Issues has been preprended to the document
      and comments are requested.

   Changes from draft-malamud-no-soliciting-01 [13] to
   draft-malamud-no-soliciting-02 [14]:

   o  A real-world example of how the proposed service extension could
      be used has been added (see Section 3).

   o  A discussion of the relative implementation difficulty of
      "SYSTEM-WIDE" versus "PER-RECIPIENT" has been added (see Section
      2.8).

   o  A discussion of the relationship of this proposal to centralized
      "do not spam" lists has been added (see Section 3.1).

   Changes from draft-malamud-no-soliciting-00 [15] to
   draft-malamud-no-soliciting-01 [16]:

   o  The two service extensions previously proposed (
      "SYSTEM-WIDE-NO-SOLICITING" and "PER-MESSAGE-NO-SOLICITING") have
      been collapsed into a single "NO-SOLICITING" service extension (
      See Section 2).

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                   January 2004


   o  "PER-MESSAGE" has been changed to "PER-RECIPIENT" to more properly
      express the operation of the extension (see Section 2.3).

   o  A solicitation class keyword syntax is introduced to allow
      different kinds of unsolicited mail to be considered (see Section
      2.2).

   o  The "Solicitation:" header has been supplemented with an extended
      "Received:" header syntax (see Section 2.6).

   o  A discussion of the use of Enhanced Mail Status Codes has been
      included (see Section 2.4).

   o  A more extensive IANA Considerations section has been added,
      including creation of a Solicitation Keywords registry (see
      Section 5).
