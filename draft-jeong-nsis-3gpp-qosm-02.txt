   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

2.  Introduction

   The NSIS working group is standardizing a signaling protocol suite
   with QoS signaling as the first use case.  The overall signaling
   protocol suite is decomposed into a generic lower layer with separate
   upper layers for signaling applications.  The upper layer protocol,
   called NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP), has an end-to-end scope
   and contains application specific functionality.  QoS-NSLP [2] which
   is an NSLP for QoS signaling defines message types and control
   information generic to all QoS models (QOSMs).  A QOSM is a defined
   mechanism for achieving QoS as a whole.  The specification of a QOSM
   includes a description of its QSPEC parameter information and how
   that information should be treated or interpreted in the network.

   The QSPEC contains a set of parameters and values describing the
   requested resources [3].  The QSPEC object also contains control
   information and the QoS parameters defined by the QOSM.  A QOSM
   provides a specific set of parameters to be carried in the QSPEC.  At
   each QoS NSIS Entity (QNE), its contents are interpreted by the
   resource management function (RMF) for policy control and traffic
   control (including admission control and configuration of the packet
   classifier and scheduler).

   [3].  One of the representative XG QOSMs shown in the figure could be
   3GPP QOSM.  QoS interworking between 3GPP wireless and non-3GPP
   wireline networks will be essential if future IP-based next
   generation networks are to provide assured-quality end-to-end IP
   flows.

   In general, in 3GPP UMTS, the wireless physical resource (e.g.,
   frequency spectrum, transmission power or time slots) can be
   considered to be a significantly scarcer resource than the bandwidth
   in IP backbone networks [8, 9].  The transmission is therefore
   optimized in order to utilize the resources as efficiently as
   possible.  Furthermore, in UMTS, different radio bearer services can
   be provided, that could result in different QoS characteristics,
   service behaviors, and service costs.  The key element for providing
   optimal QoS with spectrum efficient usage of radio resources is the
   radio management function.  The optimal QoS support can only be
   provided if the radio management function understands via the 3GPP
   QOSM, the IP service requirements, and how the radio bearers can be
   tailored to meet these needs.  Therefore, the 3GPP QOSM should be
   able to signal the user QoS requirements for a session, and as well a
   set of parameters to control the characteristics of the radio bearers
   in order to optimize the offered services while maximizing the
   efficient use of the scarce radio resources.  It is, therefore,
   important to identify what parameters the radio management function
   should get from an application that wishes to operate efficiently
   over wireless networks.  These parameters allow appropriate radio
   bearers to be selected, and to determine the effects of these bearers
   on the IP service characteristics.

   This draft describes an NSIS QoS Model (QOSM) based on 3GPP QoS
   classes and bearer service attributes.  Specifically, this draft
   describes additional optional parameters for QSPEC which carries 3GPP
   QOSM specific information, how the QSPEC information should be
   processed in QNEs, which and how other NSIS QoS models, e.g., RMD-
   QOSM [13] and Y.1541-QOSM [4], can be applied and interoperate with
   the 3GPP PDP context signaling.

3.  Summary of 3GPP QoS Classes and Attributes

   This section summarizes 3GPP QoS classes and bearer service
   attributes which are used to describe the 3GPP QOSM.

3.1  3GPP QoS Classes

   3GPP UMTS QoS classes were defined in TS 23.107[5] by taking the
   restrictions and limitations of the air interface into account.  The
   QoS mechanisms provided in the cellular network have to be robust and
   capable of providing reasonable QoS resolution.



Jeong, et al.            Expires April 27, 2006                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               3GPP QoS Model                 October 2005


   There are four different UMTS QoS classes, i.e., Conversational
   class, Streaming class, Interactive class, and Background class.  The
   main distinguishing factor between these QoS classes is how delay
   sensitive the traffic is.  For example, Conversational class is meant
   for traffic which is very delay sensitive while Background class is
   the most delay insensitive traffic class.

   Conversational and Streaming classes are mainly intended to be used
   to carry real-time traffic flows.  The main divider between them is
   how delay sensitive the traffic is.  Conversational real-time
   services, like video telephony, are the most delay sensitive
   applications and those data streams should be carried in
   Conversational class.

   Interactive and Background classes are mainly meant to be used by
   traditional Internet applications like WWW, E-mail, Telnet, FTP, and
   News.  Due to looser delay requirements, compared to Conversational
   and Streaming classes, both provide better error rate by means of
   channel coding and retransmission.  The main difference between
   Interactive and Background classes is that Interactive class is
   mainly used by interactive applications, e.g., interactive e-mail or
   interactive web browsing, while Background class is meant for
   background traffic, e.g., background download of e-mail or background
   file downloading.  Traffic in the Interactive class has higher
   priority in scheduling than Background class traffic, so background
   applications use transmission resources only when interactive
   applications do not need them.  This is very important in wireless
   environment where the bandwidth is scarce compared to fixed networks.
   To achieve QoS interoperability for end-to-end QoS, the mappings
   between 3GPP QoS classes (defined in TS 23.107) and non-3GPP QoS
   Classes such as Y.1541 and DiffServ classes will be important.

3.2  3GPP QoS Attributes

   UMTS bearer service attributes describe the service provided by the
   UMTS network to the user of the UMTS bearer service.  A set of QoS
   attributes (QoS profile) defined in TS 23.107 are listed below [5].

   (a) Traffic class

   (b) Maximum bitrate (kbps)

   (c) Guaranteed bitrate (kbps)

   (d) Delivery order (y/n)

   (e) Maximum SDU size (octets)

Internet-Draft               3GPP QoS Model                 October 2005


   (f) SDU format information (bits)

   (g) SDU error ratio

   (h) Residual bit error ratio

   (i) Delivery of erroneous SDUs (y/n)

   (j) Transfer delay (ms)

   (k) Traffic handling priority

   (l) Allocation/Retention Priority

   (m) Source statistics descriptor ('speech'/'unknown')

   (n) Signaling Indication (Yes/No)

4.  QoS Mappings between TS 23.107 and Other QoS Models

   The following two subsections illustrate possible mappings between
   3GPP UMTS QoS classes in TS 23.107 and other QoS classes.  These
   mappings will be useful for interoperation between 3GPP networks and
   non-3GPP networks.  More detailed mappings will be implementation
   specific.

4.1  QoS Mapping between TS 23.107 and Y.1541/DiffServ

4.1.1  Mapping between TS 23.107 and Y.1541 QoS Classes

   ITU-T Recommendation Y.1541 proposes six QoS classes defined
   according to the desired QoS performance objectives [4].  These QoS
   classes support a wide range of user applications.  The QoS classes
   group performance objectives for one-way IP packet delay (IPTD), IP
   packet delay variation (IPDV), IP packet loss ratio (IPLR), and IP
   packet error ratio (IPER).  Classes 0 and 1 support interactive real-
   time applications, and Classes 2, 3, and 4, support non-interactive
   applications.  Class 5 has all the QoS parameters unspecified.  These
   classes serve as a basis for agreements between end-users and service
   providers, and between service providers.  They support a wide range
   of traffic applications including point-to-point telephony, data
   transfer, multimedia conferencing, and others.  The limited number of
   classes supports the requirement for feasible implementation,
   particularly with respect to scale in global networks.

   Based on the definitions above, the 3GPP Conversational and Streaming
   classes may correspond to Y.1541 classes 0 and 1, respectively.  The
   two classes of Y.1541 and TS 23.107 are intended to support real-time



Jeong, et al.            Expires April 27, 2006                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               3GPP QoS Model                 October 2005


   services.  The Conversational class and Y.1541 class 0 have a more
   stringent latency requirement than the Streaming class and Y.1541
   class 1.  In both specifications, jitter is intended to be limited.
   In addition, the 3GPP Interactive class may correspond to Y.1541
   classes 2, 3, and 4, and one of the relevant applications is
   interactive data.  More detailed mappings can be found in [10].

4.1.2  Mapping between TS 23.107 and DiffServ QoS Classes

   DiffServ [9] proposes differentiation in the queueing and forwarding
   treatment received by packets at the routers in the network domain,
   on the basis of DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs) included in their
   headers at the ingress of the network domain.  IETF has standardized
   two groups of behavior aggregates, namely expedited forwarding or EF
   (one class) and assured forwarding or AF (four classes each
   containing three drop-precedence levels).  The actual policies used
   for marking, queueing and forwarding of packets at routers in
   DiffServ domain is an implementation-specific issue.

   EF per-hop behavior (PHB) group has been defined with the intention
   of providing leased-line like service using DiffServ.  This is
   achieved by regulating the total rate of all the flows registered
   with the EF PHB class to be less than the service rate allocated to
   the EF PHB class at that node.  Strict policing is enforced on the
   flows, and any non-conforming packets are dropped at the ingress
   itself.  The AF PHB group has provision for classifying packets into
   different precedence levels.  Three such levels have been specified
   and each level is associated with a drop precedence.  Thus, each AF
   class has three DSCPs reserved, one for each level.  AF PHB group
   defines a relationship between these three precedence levels.  If
   congestion occurs at a particular forwarding node, a packet with the
   lowest drop precedence must have the lowest probability of being
   dropped.  Likewise, a packet with the highest drop precedence has the
   highest probability of dropping.

   Based on the definitions above, it appears that the 3GPP
   Conversational class corresponds to EF PHB class which can support
   low latency and jitter, and the 3GPP Streaming class may also
   correspond to EF.  The 3GPP Interactive class may correspond to AF4
   or AF 3 (which can support low latency (but not as low as in
   conversational class)), and the Background class may correspond to
   AF2, AF1, or BE PHB class (which does not impose any special QoS
   requirement).  Please note that there may be different reasonable
   mappings.

4.2  QoS Mapping between TS 23.107 and RMD-QOSM

   In Section 8.4 of RFC 3726 [14] it is emphasized that in an UMTS like



Jeong, et al.            Expires April 27, 2006                 [Page 7]

   scenario, (see Figure 2) the NSIS QoS protocol can be applied between
   a base station and the gateway (GW).  Furthermore, in this scenario
   the NSIS QoS protocol can also be applied either between two GWs, or
   between two edge routers (ERs).  In these situations, the RMD-QOS
   model [13] can be used to satisfy the requirements imposed by the
   characteristics of such topologies.  In these cases the mapping
   between the attributes specified in [5] depends on bandwidth and
   provisioning of resources among the different DiffServ classes which
   the operators control to satisfy their cost and performance
   requirements.

   An example of mapping the TS 23.107 and RMD-QOSM DiffServ QoS Classes
   could be similar to the mapping explained in Section 3.1.2.

   An example of mapping the TS 23.107 and RMD-QOSM bandwidth parameters
   is:

   RMD QOSM <Bandwidth> = TS 23.107 <Maximum bitrate>

5.  Additional Optional QSPEC Parameters for 3GPP QOSM

   Some of the 3GPP QoS attributes described in Section 2.2 are
   specified in the QSPEC draft [3].  Additional optional QSPEC



Jeong, et al.            Expires April 27, 2006                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               3GPP QoS Model                 October 2005


   parameters should be defined for appropriate radio resource
   management in UMTS.  This section provides the description and the
   format of these additional optional parameters.  More detailed
   description will be provided in the later version of this draft.

   [Editorial note: The number of the additional QSPEC parameters given
   in this version is not fixed.  Future versions of the draft may
   include more QSPEC parameters.]

5.1  3GPP QoS Classes

   Traffic class represents the type of application (i.e.,
   'conversational', 'streaming', 'interactive', or 'background') for
   which the UMTS bearer service is optimized.  By including the traffic
   class as an attribute, UMTS can make assumptions about the traffic
   source and optimize the transport for that traffic type.  This
   parameter can be defined in a way similar to the <Y.1541 QoS Class>
   parameter in [3] except for the number of classes, i.e., 4 in this
   draft.

5.2  Delivery of Erroneous SDU (DES)

   Delivery of erroneous SDUs (DES) indicates whether SDUs detected as
   erroneous shall be delivered or discarded. 'yes' implies that error
   detection is employed and that erroneous SDUs are delivered together
   with an error indication, 'no' implies that error detection is
   employed and that erroneous SDUs are discarded, and '-' implies that
   SDUs are delivered without considering error detection.  This
   attribute is used to decide whether error detection is needed and
   whether frames with detected errors shall be forwarded or not.

   The DES (2 bits) parameter is represented as follows.

        0 1
       +-+-+

   source of submitted SDUs.  Conversational speech has a well-known
   statistical behaviour.  By being informed that the SDUs for a UMTS
   bearer are generated by a speech source, RAN, the serving GPRS
   support node (SGSN) and the gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) and also
   the user equipment (UE) may, based on experience, calculate a
   statistical multiplex gain for use in admission control on the
   relevant interfaces.  The format of SSD parameter will be provided in
   the later version of this draft.

5.4  Signaling Indication (SI)

   Signaling Indication (SI) indicates the signaling nature of the
   submitted SDUs.  This attribute is additional to the other QoS
   attributes and does not over-ride them.  This attribute is only
   defined for the interactive traffic class.  If signaling indication
   is set to 'Yes', the UE should set the traffic handling priority to
   '1'.  Signaling traffic can have different characteristics to other
   interactive traffic, e.g., higher priority, lower delay, and so on.
   This attribute permits enhancing the RAN operation accordingly.  The
   SI parameter (1 bit) is represented as follows.

        0
       +--+
       |SI|
       +--+

   Two values of SI are listed below to indicate different meanings.

       0 - 'No'
       1 - 'Yes'


5.5  SDU Format Information (SFI)

   The SDU format information represents the list of possible exact
   sizes of SDUs.  UMTS uses the Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) [11] or the
   AMR Wideband (AMR-WB) [12] as speech transcoders.  As emphasized in
   [15], the speech bits encoded in each AMR or AMR-WB frame have
   different perceptual sensitivity to bit errors.  By applying this
   property a better voice quality can be achieved using Unequal Error
   Protection (UEP) and Unequal Error Detection (UED) mechanisms.  These
   mechanisms focus on the protection and detection of corrupted bits
   only to the perceptually most sensitive bits in an AMR or AMR-WB
   frame.  In AMR and AMR-WB, these most sensitive bits are denoted as
   class A bits.  Two other classes are also used, i.e., B and C,
   wherein the bits belonging into these classes are less sensitive to
   errors.  In this case, a frame is declared correct even when no bits
   in class A are corrupted, and some bits in class B and C are indeed



Jeong, et al.            Expires April 27, 2006                [Page 10]

   corrupted.  If the bits in class A are corrupted then the frame is
   anyway declared corrupted.

   The UEP and UED mechanisms could therefore be significant in
   achieving spectrum efficient resource management.  In order to be
   able to use these mechanisms, information about the payload format
   (class A, B and C sensitivity bits) is necessary at the radio level.
   The specification of the SDU format as a service parameter allows any
   application to take advantage of the UEP and UED mechanism.  The
   format of this parameter can be specified as follows.  Two types of
   AMR codecs should be supported.  The first one is the typical AMR
   codec, where the SDU format is described in Section 4 of [14].

   The second type of codec is the the AMR-WB (AMR- Wideband) codec.
   The SDU format is described in Section 4 of [15].  The format of this
   parameter should be a QSPEC Control Information container.  Its
   format should be:

        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   AT (AMR type): 2 bits integer used to soecify the used AMR type and
   its values are:

       0: (default) typical AMR codec as specified in [14]
       1: AMR-WB (AMR- Wideband) codec as specified in [15].
       2: reserved for future use
       3: reserved for future use

       Frame Type (FT): 4 bits

       Q (Frame Quality Indicator): 1 bit

       MIndication (Mode Indication: MI):  4 bits
       If AT = 0 then only the 3 Most Signifficant Bits are used
       If AT = 1 then the 4 bits are used

       MRequest (Mode Request: MR):  4 bits
       If AT = 0 then only the 3 Most Signifficant Bits are used.
       If AT = 1 then the 4 bits are used

       CRC (Codec CRC):  8 bits

   Note that the Frame Type and the Frame Quality Indicator represent
   the AMR header.  The Mode Indication, Mode Request and Codec CRC
   parameters represent the AMR Auxiliary information.  The Class A

   bits, Class B bits and Class C bits represent the AMR Core frame.
   Using the AMR header and AMR Auxiliary information the destination
   can deduce how many bits should be used for Class A, how many for
   Class B and how many for class C in the AMR Core frame.

5.6  Transfer Delay (TD)

   [Editorial note: This parameter may have the same semantic behavior
   as its associated QSPEC parameter (i.e., QSPEC Path Latency
   Parameter) described in the QSPEC template draft.  A future version
   of this daft may use the associated QSPEC template parameter instead
   of the currently specified one.]

   Transfer delay (ms) indicates maximum delay for 95th percentile of
   the distribution of delay for all delivered SDUs during the lifetime
   of a bearer service.  This parameter allows the radio management
   function to efficiently configure the radio bearer service.  For
   example, by knowing the Delay requirement, the appropriate
   interleaving depth can be estimated.  This parameter could also be
   used to determine the maximum number of retransmissions (if any) in
   the wireless link.

   The transfer delay (ms) is represented as a 32-bit integer as shown
   below.

       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

5.7  Packet Loss Ratio (PLR)

   [Editorial note: This parameter may have the same semantic behavior
   as its associated QSPEC parameter (i.e., QSPEC Path BER Parameter)
   described in the QSPEC template draft.  A future version of this daft
   may use the associated QSPEC template parameter instead of the
   currently specifeid one.]

   The packet loss ratio can significantly affect the subjective quality
   of real time applications.  This parameter can be used by the radio
   management function for admission control and to set some parameters
   of the radio part, such as L2 buffer size.

   The Packet Loss Ratio is represented as a 32-bit integer as shown
   below.

       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

5.8  Traffic Handling Priority (THP)

   Traffic handling priority specifies the relative importance for
   handling of all SDUs belonging to the UMTS bearer compared to the
   SDUs of other bearers.  In many interactive packet services the
   packet handling priority can be used to provide certain levels of QoS
   differentiation, in particular in congestion situations.  According
   to Section 6.5.1 of [5] the Traffic handling priority class can get
   the values 1, 2 and 3.  Therefore the format of this parameter is:

        0 1
       +-+-+
       |THP|
       +-+-+

   Note that the length of this parameter is 2 bits integer.

6.  Interoperation with 3GPP UMTS

   This section describes two possible interoperation scenrios for NSIS
   QoS signaling which is initiated by QNEs in UMTS.

6.1  UE-initiated NSIS signaling

   This section describes an interoperation scenario for end-to-end NSIS
   signaling that is initiated from a UE connected to a UTMS network.
   Figure 3 shows an end-to-end network architecture [6, 7] used to
   explain how end-to-end QoS signaling is achieved using NSIS in the
   situation where 3GPP and non-3GPP networks are interconnected.

                  Scope of PDP Context

   Figure 3. An End-to-End Network Architecture

   Figure 4 shows signaling flows in the scenario.  The UE acts as a QNI
   and initiates NSIS signaling towards the remote end.  The IP backbone
   network is DiffServ-enabled, and the GGSN supports DiffServ.  The
   application layer (e.g., SIP/SDP) between the end hosts identifies
   the QoS requirements.  The QoS requirements from the application
   layer are mapped down to create an NSIS session.  The QoS for the
   wireless access is provided by the PDP context.  The wireless QoS can
   be controlled through signaling for the PDP context.  The UE
   populates the initiator QSPEC and establishes the PDP context
   suitable for supporting the NSIS session based on the QSPEC
   information.

   To activate the PDP context, the UE sends an Activate (Secondary) PDP
   Context message to the SGSN with the UMTS QoS parameters, and the
   SGSN sends the corresponding Create PDP Context message to the GGSN.
   The GGSN authorizes the PDP context activation request according to
   the local operator's IP bearer resource based policy, the local
   operator's admission control function and the GPRS roaming agreements
   and sends a Create PDP Context Response message back to the SGSN.
   The radio access bearer (RAB) setup is done by the RAB assignment
   procedure, and the SGSN sends an Activate (Secondary) PDP Context
   Accept message to the UE.

   Upon receiving the Activate PDP Context Accept message, the QoS-NSLP
   at the UE (QNI) sends a QoS-NSLP RESERVE (in case of sender-initiated
   approach) message which contains the Initiator QSPEC to the next hop
   in the external IP network through the GGSN.  The Initiator QSPEC
   specifies optional parameters specific to 3GPP QoS model as well as
   generic QSPEC parameters for the application flow.

   Please note that the NSIS signaling and the PDP signaling could also
   be used in an interleaved way.

   In the example above, only RMD-QOSM is assumed to be used in the
   external network.  The signaling procedure for QoS interworking in
   the situation where the external network is based on Y.1541-QOSM will
   be similar except for QoS mapping.

6.2  GGSN-initiated NSIS signaling

   This section describes a scenario for NSIS signaling that is
   initiated from the GGSN.  That is, the GGSN acts as a QNI in this
   scenario.

   Figure 5. GGSN-initiated NSIS signaling

   Figure 5 shows signaling flows in the scenario.  The GGSN acts as a
   QNI and initiates NSIS signaling towards the remote end.  The IP
   backbone network is DiffServ enabled, and the GGSN supports DiffServ.
   The application layer (e.g., SIP/SDP) between the end hosts
   identifies the QoS requirements.  The wireless QoS can be controlled
   through signaling for the PDP context.  Therefore, the QoS
   requirements from the application layer are mapped down to the PDP
   context at the UE.

   To activate the PDP context, the UE sends an Activate (Secondary) PDP
   Context message to the SGSN with the UMTS QoS parameters, and the
   SGSN sends the corresponding Create PDP Context message to the GGSN.
   The GGSN authorizes the PDP context activation request according to
   the local operator's IP bearer resource based policy, the local
   operator's admission control function and the GPRS roaming agreements
   and sends a Create PDP Context Response message back to the SGSN.
   The radio access bearer (RAB) setup is done by the RAB assignment
   procedure, and the SGSN sends an Activate (Secondary) PDP Context
   Accept message to the UE.

   The GGSN populates the initiator QSPEC based on the PDP context to
   create an NSIS session.  The QoS-NSLP at the GGSN (QNI) sends a QoS-
   NSLP RESERVE (in case of sender-initiated approach) message which
   contains the Initiator QSPEC to the next hop in the external IP
   network.  The Initiator QSPEC specifies optional parameters specific
   to 3GPP QoS model as well as generic QSPEC parameters for the
   application flow.  Note that QoS mapping between the 3GPP and
   DiffServ QoS classes/parameters should be performed at the GGSN.

   In the example above, only RMD-QOSM is assumed to be used in the
   external network.  The signaling procedure for QoS interworking in
   the situation where the external network is based on Y.1541-QOSM will
   be similar except for QoS mapping.

7.  NSIS Signaling within the IP-based Transport Part of UMTS/GPRS

   As emphasized in [5], the RAN/BSS Access bearer services and Core
   network bearer services for packet traffic shall provide different
   bearer services for variety of QoS.  The operator is responsible for
   choosing which QoS capabilities in Frame Relay layer, in IP layer or
   in ATM layer are used.  Regarding the IP based RAN/BSS Access bearer
   services and Core network bearer services it is recommended that the
   Differentiated Services defined by IETF shall be used.  The NSIS RMD-
   QOSM [13] satisfies this recommendation and therefore, it can be
   considered as a feasible solution on satisfying the QoS requirements
   imposed by the RAN Access bearer services and Core network bearer
   services on the IP based transport part of UMTS/GPRS.  The QoS
   support in the IP based transport of UMTS/GPRS can be achieved by
   combining either the UE (MS) initiated or the network initiated
   Activate/Modify/Deactivate PDP context procedures, specified in [16]
   with the NSIS RMD-QOSM procedures specified in [13].  This is
   depicted in Figure 6, where either a UE (MS), or a SGSN or a GGSN can
   start the PDP context procedures on requesting, modifying or deleting
   a PDP context, in terms of QoS.  The NSIS RMD-QOSM procedures can be
   applied on the IP based transport  network(s), see also Figure 2,
   used between:

       * Node B (Base Station) and RNC (or BSC)
       * between RNC's (or BSC's)
       * between SGSN and GGSN

   A possible way of achieving the QoS mapping between the PDP context
   procedures and the NSIS RMD-QOSM is described in Section 4.2.

   There are no new security considerations based on this draft.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the
   QSPEC template, in accordance with BCP 26 RFC 2434 [16]. [2] requires
   IANA to create a new registry for QoS Model Identifiers.  The QoS
   Model Identifier (QOSM ID) is a 32-bit value carried in a QSPEC
   object.  The allocation policy for new QOSM IDs is TBD.  This
   document also defines new objects for the QSPEC Template, as etailed
   in Section 5.  Values are to be assigned for them from the NTLP
   Object Type registry.
