Abstract

   This document defines the "Repr-Type" and "Resource-Type" HTTP 
   entity-header field names, to provide URIs that identify the 
   generic type (class membership) of representations and their 
   original source resources respectively.

1. Introduction

   Providing a resource type along with an HTTP response is useful, 
   since there may be no other way to identify the resource type within 
   the domain of the HTTP message. For example, HTML pages do not give 
   a machine processable type for the resource that they are 
   representations of.

   Meanwhile, using MIME types to identify content types is 
   architecturally inadvisable due to the centralization around the 
   IANA - URIs should identify all important things on the Web, and 
   content types are no exception. (Note that the current set of MIME 
   types can have URIs, and those can be used in the Repr-Type header).

   In fact, the content type idiom is isomorphic with that of the 
   "Class" class in RDF Schema [RDFSchema].

     "RDF classes can be defined to represent almost anything, such as 
     Web pages, people, document types, databases or abstract concepts."
     - http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-rdf-schema-20000327/#s2.2.3

   Repr-Type values are generally restricted to content type classes, 
   whereas the Resource-Type value have no such restriction, according 
   to the definition of resource in RFC 2396.

2. Entity-Header Productions

2.1 Syntax

   Here is an ABNF for the proposed entity-headers:-

      ResourceType =  "Resource-Type" ":" 1#URIview
      ReprType     =  "Repr-Type" ":" 1#URIview

      URIview      =  absoluteURI [ "#" fragment ]     ; from [RFC2396]

   The <absoluteURI>, and <fragment> components are imported from 
   [RFC2396].

   Two examples of syntactically valid ResourceType productions (i.e. 
   "Resource-Type" HTTP headers) are:-

      Resource-Type: http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person
      Resource-Type: http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/doc#Work

   Two examples of syntactically valid ReprType productions (i.e. 
   "Repr-Type" HTTP headers) are:-

      Repr-Type: http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log#N3Document
      Repr-Type: http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/html

2.2 Equality and Character Parsing of Header Values

   Header values are to be compared on a character for character (case 
   sensitive) basis. Due to internationalization issues, escaped 
   unicode characters are allowed in the URI header values. You must 
   use the following escaping procedure:-

     * Each disallowed character is converted to UTF-8 (as defined in 
       [RFC2279]) as one or more bytes.
     * Any bytes corresponding to a disallowed character are escaped 
       with the URI escaping mechanism (that is, converted to %HH, 
       where HH is the hexadecimal notation of the byte value).
     * The original character is replaced by the resulting character 
       sequence.

3. General Use Considerations

   It is perfectly legal and sensible for either of the defined 
   entity-headers to occur more than once; if they do, then processors 
   should take the intersection of the given classes. For example, a 
   Resource Type may be both Vehicle and a Car. A Representation Type 
   may be both an XML document, and a canonicalized XML document.

   Note that if the Repr-Type (and possibly Content-Type) headers 
   conflict semantically, then all of the Repr-Type headers (or just 
   those that conflict with Content-Type, if present) should be 
   abandoned.

4. Security Considerations

   Implementors should take heed of section 15.1.1 of [RFC2616]. There 
   may be other security considerations that have not yet been raised.

   The relevant security issues associated with each Repr-Type value 
   should obviously be taken into consideration when handling the 
   entity-body.
