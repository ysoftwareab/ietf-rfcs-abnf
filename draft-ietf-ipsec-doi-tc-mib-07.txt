Internet Draft      IPsec DOI Textual Conventions MIB      February 2003


Abstract

   This document defines textual conventions for the constants used in
   MIBs for the IPsec protocols.  In particular, it documents those
   numbers whose assignments are managed by the IANA, with new
   assignments being made over time.  The textual conventions provide
   IPsec-related MIBs with clearer documentation, and insulate them from
   having to track new assignments by the IANA.

   The MIB documented by this document will become a separate living
   document maintained by the IANA, and will be the document of record
   for these assignments.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines textual conventions for use in monitoring, status,
   and configuration MIBs for IPsec.  It includes a MIB module that
   defines those textual conventions.

2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Discussion

   The IPsec architecture [SECARCH] defines protocols for dynamic key
   management.  These are based on the Internet Security Association and
   Key Management Protocol [ISAKMP].

   ISAKMP defines the concept of Domains of Interpretation (DOI).  The
   IPsec architecture has defined the Internet IP Security Domain of
   Interptetation for ISAKMP [IPDOI].

   The IPsec architecture defines the Internet Key Exchange [IKE].  The
   use of this protocol is indicated by one of the constants in the
   IPsec DOI.

   This MIB defines textual conventions for the constants defined in
   ISAKMP, the IPsec DOI, and IKE.

   These are defined in a seperate MIB for two reasons.

   o    There will be variables with a syntax corresponding to these
        textual conventions in numberous MIBs that will be defined for
        the IPsec architecture.

   o    All of the numbers defined in these textual conventions are in
        "magic number" spaces that are managed by the IANA.

   If these conventions were part of the relevant MIBs, those MIBs would
   be constantly out of date.  By placing them in a seperate MIB, that
   MIB can be maintained by the IANA simultaneously with assigning new
   values.

      DESCRIPTION  "The MIB module which defines the textual conventions
                   used in IPsec MIBs.  This includes Internet DOI
                   numbers defined in RFC 2407, ISAKMP numbers defined
                   in RFC 2408, and IKE numbers defined in RFC 2409.

                   These Textual Conventions are defined in a separate
                   MIB module since they are protocol numbers managed
                   by the IANA.  Revision control after publication
                   will be under the authority of the IANA.

7.  Revision History

   This section will be removed before publication.

   February 3, 1999.  Initial release as draft-shriver-doi-tc-
   mib-00.txt, due to issues as to whether the MIB was an IPsec or
   IPsecond work item.

   March 22, 1999.  Released as draft-ietf-ipsec-doi-tc-mib-00.txt.
   Added IsakmpDOI textual convention.

   October 13, 1999.  Use real number in experimental branch.  Added
   IsakmpExchangeType and IkeExchangeType.  Split IkeNotifyMessageType
   off of IsakmpNotifyMessageType, and removed IPsec DOI values from the
   latter.  Corrected latest values of IkeAuthMethod, there had been
   some "number grabbing" in Internet-Drafts, now tracking the IKE
   Internet-Draft.  Cleaned up references.

   October 15, 1999.  Removed stray comma in MIB.

   June 13, 2000.  Enforced consistent capitalization of IPsec.

   November 22, 2000.  Updated with the recent IANA assignments,
   particularly for AES, also from RFC 2857.  Removed any numbers
   assigned only in the IKE Internet-Draft, since those cannot go in an
   RFC, and this is going out first.

   October 3, 2001.  Some changes in descriptions from readers'
   comments.  For those variables defined as enumerations, where the
   protocol defines the value 0 as reserved, but the MIBs use the value
   0 to indicate none, change the naming to none, and properly document
   the dual meaning.

   November 29, 2001.  Added missing status "connected" in
   IsakmpNotifyMessageType.

   February 27, 2003.  Catch up with changes in RFC authoring
   requirements.  Add some new values that appear to have been assigned
   by the IANA.  Change MIB name to ianaIPsecIsakmpIkeDoiTcMib, to make
   it clear that this is IANA-maintained.

10.  Security Considerations

   Since this MIB defines only textual conventions, there are no
   security considerations.  Security considerations exist only when
   managed objects are defined with these textual conventions.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document is the MIB definitions corresponding to a group of
   "magic numberes" that are maintained by the IANA.  The IANA will
   maintain the MIB in this document as they assign new values of these
   magic numbers.

   This MIB will be maintained in the same manner as the IANAifType-MIB.
