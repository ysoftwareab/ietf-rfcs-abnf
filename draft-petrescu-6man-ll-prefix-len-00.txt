1.  Statement

   The length of the IPv6 link-local prefix is 64 decimal.

   The IPv6 link-local prefix is represented textually "fe80::/64".

   The illustration of the IPv6 link-local prefix is:


     |
     |    64 bits, the link-local prefix  |          64 bits           |
     +----------+-------------------------+----------------------------+
     |1111111010000000000000...00000000000|       interface ID         |
     +----------+-------------------------+----------------------------+

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   prefix: a contiguous string of bits valid for forwarding operations
   and for subnet formation.

   textual representation of a prefix: e.g. fe80::/64.

   n leading bits: the first n bits in a string of bits read from left
   to right in a writing system that is read left-to-right.  E.g. the 10
   leading bits of the fe80::/64 textual representation of the IPv6
   link-local prefix are 1111111010.

3.  Security Considerations

   The clarification of the definition of the prefix length of the IPv6
   link-local prefix at IANA is: call it 'leading bits' and not
   'prefix', or state that the IPv6 prefix length of link-local
   addresses is 10 decimal.  This clarification has beneficial impact in
   the algorithm implementation for calculation of the opaque and stable
   Interface Identifiers for IPv6 link-local addresses.  It also
   positively impacts some implementations of IPv6 forwarding.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to change the name of the column head in the table
   that depicts the "Internet Protocol Version 6 Address Space".  The
   name should be "The n leading bits of an address" instead of "IPv6
   Prefix".

   The desired effect of this change is that the IPv6 link-local prefix
   be "fe80::/64" and that the 10 leading bits of this prefix be
   1111111010.  A second effect is that the textual representation
   "fe80::/10" as an IPv6 link-local prefix should disappear from that
   IANA page, because it is wrong.
