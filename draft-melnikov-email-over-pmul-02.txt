1.  Introduction

   P_MUL [ACP142A] is a protocol for reliable multicast in bandwidth
   constrained and delayed acknowledgement environments running over
   UDP.  The objectives of this protocol are first to take advantage of
   the bandwidth saving feature of using the multicast service as
   supported by modern computer networks and second to allow message
   transfer under EMCON conditions.  EMCON (Emission Control) or "Radio
   Silence" means that, although receiving nodes are able to receive
   messages, they are not able to acknowledge the receipt of messages.

   The objective of this protocol is to take advantage of multicast
   communication for the transfer of messages between MTAs (Message
   Transfer Agents) on a single multicast network under EMCON
   conditions.  EMCON condition means that a receiving node is able to
   receive messages, but it cannot - for a relitive long time (hours or
   even days) - acknowledge the received messages.

   This illustrates a simple multicast scenario, where the same message
   has to be sent from MTA 1 to MTA 2 and to MTA 3.

                                            +-------+
                                         /->| MTA 2 |

   Typical MTA Configuration

                                 Figure 1

   Using a multicast instead of an unicast communication service in the
   above MTA configuration only one message transmission from MTA 1 to
   the Router is required, instead of two as required with unicast.
   This saves the transmision of one message and thus network bandwidth
   utilisation.  Depending on the network bandwidth (in some radio
   networks less than 9.6 Kb/s) this saving can be of vital importance.
   The saving in bandwidth utilisation becomes even greater with every
   additional receiving MTA.

   As P_Mul employs a connectionless transport protocol to transmit
   messages, the reliable message transfer is guaranteed even in those
   cases, when for a certain period of time one or more of the receiving
   MTAs are not able or allowed to acknowledge completely received
   messages.

   This protocol specification requires fixed multicast groups and a
   well known knowledge at each participating node(MTA) about the group
   memberships to one or more multicast groups of each participating
   node.

   This document defines application protocol MULE (Multicast Email) for
   transferring Internet Mail messages [RFC5322] over ACP 142 P_Mul.

3.  Gatewaying from Internet Mail

3.1.  Sending Internet Messages

   When the content type for a message is an Internet message content
   type (which may be 7bit, 8bit or binary MIME), this is transported
   using ACP 142 [ACP142A].  Firstly, for each [RFC5322] email message a
   BSMTP-like payload is formed, which encapsulates RFC 5322
   representations of the message without changes.  This is described in
   Section 3.1.1.  Secondly, the created payload is compressed and
   encoded as specified in Section 3.1.2.  Thirdly, the compressed
   payload is sent by P_Mul as a series of Address_PDU and one or more
   DATA_PDUs.  When the message has an associated MT-PRIORITY value
   [RFC6710], the MappedPriority(value) is included as the Priority
   field of corresponding ACP 142 PDUs, including Address_PDU,
   DATA_PDUs, DISCARD_MESSAGE_PDU.  Here MappedPriority(x) is defined as
   "-1 * x + 6".

   The sender of the message can assume that the receiver supports (i.e.
   the receiving MTA MUST support) the following ESMTP extensions: DSN
   [RFC3461], SIZE [RFC1870], 8BITMIME [RFC6152], MT-PRIORITY [RFC6710],
   DELIVERBY [RFC2852].

   The receiver MAY accept BINARYMIME [RFC3030] SMTP extension.  This is
   a matter for bilateral agreement.  As the message content size can
   always be determined from the compression wrapper and the size of the
   envelope, no special handling is needed for binary messages.

   The set of ACP 142 destinations for the message is derived from the
   next hop MTAs for each of the recipients.

3.1.1.  BSMTP-like Payload construction

   MULE is derived from BSMTP [RFC2442], with small modifications.  We
   call the modified BSMTP format used in this document "BSMTP-like
   payload".  As with BSMTP, ESMTP capability negotiation is not used,
   since receiver EMCON restrictions prohibit such real-time
   interaction.  For that reason, there is no point in including EHLO
   capabilities.  "MAIL FROM:" and "RCPT TO:" prefixes can also be
   eluded in order to save a few bytes.

   For each received SMTP message, the corresponding BSMTP-like payload
   is constructed as follows (Lines are terminated using CR LF):

      The first line is what would be used for the data following "MAIL
      FROM:" in the SMTP dialogue.  I.e. it contains the return-path
      address, within <>'s followed by any ESMTP extension parameters to
      the MAIL FROM command.

Internet-Draft             Email over ACP 142               October 2017


      After that, there is a separate line for each recipient of the
      message.  The value is what would follow "RCPT TO:" in the SMTP
      dialogue, i.e. the recipient address within <>'s followed by any
      ESMTP extension parameters to the corresponding RCPT TO command.

      The list of recipients is terminated by an empty line (i.e. just
      CR LF)

      The message content follows the empty line.  There is no need for
      transparency ("dot stuffing") or terminating CRLF.CRLF as the end
      of the message content is indicated by the end of the data (See
      Section 3.1.2 for more details).

   Example of a BSMTP-like payload


<from@example.com> MT-PRIORITY=4 BODY=8BITMIME RET=HDRS ENVID=QQ314159
<to1@example.net> NOTIFY=SUCCESS,FAILURE ORCPT=rfc822;Bob@enterprise.example.net
<to2@example.net> NOTIFY=SUCCESS,FAILURE

From: from@example.com
To: To1 <to1@example.net>, To2 <to2@example.net>
Date: 27 Apr 2017 16:17 +0100
Subject: a test
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-transfer-encoding: 8bit

This is worth <poundsign>100


   ABNF for the BSMTP-like payload is:

bsmtp-like-payload = envelope CRLF payload
envelope = FROM-line 1*RCPT-line
FROM-line = reverse-path [SP mail-parameters] CRLF
RCPT-line = forward-path [SP rcpt-parameters] CRLF

payload = *OCTET
          ; Conforms to message syntax as defined in RFC 5322 and extended in MIME

OCTET = <any 0-255 octet value>
reverse-path = <as defined in RFC 5321>
forward-path = <as defined in RFC 5321>
mail-parameters = <as defined in RFC 5321>
rcpt-parameters = <as defined in RFC 5321>

3.1.2.  Payload compression

   BSMTP-like payload (Section 3.1.1) is compressed using zlibCompress
   [RFC1951] and placed in the compressedContent field of the
   CompressedContentInfo element defined in Section 4.2.6 of
   [STANAG-4406].  This is then encoded as BER encoding [ITU.X690.2002]
   of the CompressedData ASN.1 structure.  For convenience, ASN.1 of the
   CompressedData structure is included below.  The contentType-
   ShortForm value used by MULE is 25.

   The above procedure is similar to how X.400 messages are sent using
   Annex E of STANAG 4406 Ed 2.  This makes it easier to implement MTAs
   that support both Internet messages and X.400 messages in the same
   code base.

   The Compressed Data Type (CDT) consists of content of any type that
   is compressed using a specified algorithm.  The following object
   identifier identifies the Compressed Data Type:

            id-mmhs-CDT ID ::= { iso(1) identified-organization(3) nato(26) stanags(0)
                                  mmhs(4406) object-identifiers(0) id-mcont(4) 2 }

Internet-Draft             Email over ACP 142               October 2017


   The Compressed Data Type are defined by the following ASN.1 type:

DEFINITIONS ::=
BEGIN
CompressedData ::= SEQUENCE {
                     compressionAlgorithm CompressionAlgorithmIdentifier,
                     compressedContentInfo CompressedContentInfo
                   }
CompressionAlgorithmIdentifier ::= CHOICE {
                     algorithmID-ShortForm [0] AlgorithmID-ShortForm,
                     algorithmID-OID [1] OBJECT IDENTIFIER
                   }
AlgorithmID-ShortForm ::= INTEGER { zlibCompress (0) }
CompressedContentInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
                     CHOICE {
                       contentType-ShortForm [0] ContentType-ShortForm,
                       contentType-OID [1] OBJECT IDENTIFIER
                     },
                     compressedContent [0] EXPLICIT OCTET STRING
                   }
ContentType-ShortForm ::= INTEGER {
                     unidentified (0),
                     external (1), -- identified by the object-identifier
                                   -- of the EXTERNAL content
                     p1 (2),
                     p3 (3),
                     p7 (4)
                   }
END

3.2.  Error handling

   As MULE doesn't allow next hop MTA to return immediate Response Codes
   for FROM-line or any of recipients in RCPT-line, MTAs that are
   compliant with this specification that receive a message that can't
   be delivered MUST generate a non delivery DSN report [RFC6522]
   message which includes message/delivery-status body part [RFC3464]
   and submit it using MULE to the FROM-line return-path address.

   TBC: Also need to describe how to handle FROM-line or RCPT-line
   parameters that we don't understand.  Probably, they can be rejected
   on receipt or be relayed to the final destination/gateway, which can
   decide what to do with them.

3.3.  Use of BDAT

   If a message is received by a gateway, through SMTP transfers using
   the CHUNKING extension, the message is rebuilt by the receiving MTA
   into its complete, single, original form and is then used as a single
   MULE message payload.  Use of BINARYMIME [RFC3030] might need to be
   enabled in the FROM-line.

   BURL [RFC4468] SMTP extension only applies to SMTP Submission, so it
   is already mapped to BDAT/DATA by the time it reaches MULE.

4.  Gatewaying to Internet Mail

   Gatewaying from ACP 142 environment to Internet Email is the reverse
   of the process specified in Section 3.1.  Firstly, the message is
   reassembled from one or more DATA_PDUs.  Secondly, if the
   contentType-ShortForm value is 25, the BSMTP-like payload is
   extracted from compressedContent field and uncompressed as specified
   in Section 3.1.2.  Thirdly, the BSMTP-like payload is converted to
   SMTP transaction (see Section 3.1.1).  (The first line of the BSMTP-
   like payload is prepended with "MAIL FROM:" and each following line
   (until the empty line is encountered) is prepended with "RCPT TO:".
   After skipping the empty delimiting line, the rest of the payload is
   the message body.  This can be either sent using DATA or a series of
   BDAT commands, depending on capabilities of the receiving SMTP
   system.)

4.1.  Error handling

   ESMTP extension parameters to MAIL FROM and RCPT TO SMTP commands
   obtained from BSMTP-like payload are processed according to
   specifications of the corresponding ESMTP extensions.

   Failures to extract or uncompress BSMTP-like payload are handled
   according to ACP 142.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create a new registry "Multicast Email SMTP
   extensions".  SMTP extensions registered in the "SMTP Service
   Extensions" IANA registry can be registered in this new registry.
   Registration procedure for the new registry is "Specification
   Required" [RFC8126], but the registration reviewers will be appointed
   and managed by the editors of this document together with the
   Independent Submissions Editor.  Registration requests should include
   SMTP extension name, status (see Section 5.1) and specification
   reference.

5.1.  Mapping of existing SMTP extensions to MULE

   The following table summarizes how different SMTP extensions can be
   gatewayed to/from MULE.  Each extension has one of the following
   statuses: "required" (required to be supported on the SMTP side),
   "disallowed" (incompatible with this protocol), "N/A" (not relevant,
   because they affect commands other than MAIL FROM and RCPT TO.  Can
   be used on the SMTP side) or "supported".
