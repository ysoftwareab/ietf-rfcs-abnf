Abstract

   Network abstraction is a technique that can be applied to a network 
   domain to manage network resources to create a virtualized network 
   that is under the control of a network operator (or perhaps the 
   customer).

   Network slicing is an approach to network operations that builds on 
   the concept of network abstraction to provide programmability, 
   flexibility, and modularity.  It uses techniques such as Software
   Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
   to create multiple logical (virtual) networks, each tailored for a
   given use case, on top of a common network.

   These logical networks are referred to as network slices. A network
   slice does not necessarily represent dedicated resources in the 
   server network, but does constitute a commitment by the service 
   provider to provide a specific level of service.
   
   The Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN)
   defines an SDN-based architecture that relies on the concepts of 
   network and service abstraction to detach network and service 
   control from the underlying data plane. 
   
   This document outlines the applicability of ACTN to network 
   slicing in an IETF technology network.  It also identifies the
   features of network slicing not currently within the scope of ACTN,
   and indicates where ACTN might be extended.

1.  Introduction

   The principles of network resource separation are not new.  For 
   years, separated overlay and logical (virtual) networking have 
   existed, allowing multiple connectivity and bandwidth services to be
   deployed over a single physical network comprised of single or 
   multiple layers.  However, several key differences exist that 
   differentiate overlay and virtual networking from network slicing.
   
   A network slice construct provides an end-to-end logical network,
   often with compute functions and utilising shared underlying 
   (physical or virtual) network resources.  This logical network is
   separated from other, often concurrent, logical networks each with
   independent control and management, and each of which can be created
   or modified on demand. 
   
   At one end of the spectrum, a virtual private wire or a virtual 
   private network (VPN) is a network slice. In these cases, the network
   slices do not require the service provider to isolate network 
   resources for the provision of the service - the service is 
   "virtual".
   
   At the other end of the spectrum there may be a detailed description 
   of a complex service that will meet the needs of a set of 
   applications with connectivity, bandwidth, and function requirements
   that include compute resource, storage capability, and access to 
   content. Such a service may be requested dynamically (that is, 
   instantiated when an application needs it, and released when the 
   application no longer needs it), and modified as the needs of the 
   application change.
   
   Each example represents a self-contained network that must be 
   flexible enough to simultaneously accommodate diverse business-driven
   use cases from multiple players on a common network infrastructure.

   This document outlines the application of the ACTN architecture and
   enabling technologies to network slicing in an IETF technology 
   network.  It describes how the ACTN functional components can be used
   to support model-driven partitioning of variable-sized bandwidth to
   facilitate network sharing and virtualization.  Furthermore, the use
   of model-based interfaces to dynamically request the instantiation of
   virtual networks could be extended to encompass requesting and 
   instantiation of specific Network Functions (which may be both 
   physical and/or virtual), and to partition network resources such as
   compute resource, storage capability, and access to content.  
   
   This document highlights how the ACTN approach might be extended to
   address these other requirements of network slicing.

1.1 Terminology 

   Resource: Any features or functions that can be delivered by a server
   network.  Includes connectivity, compute resources, storage, and 
   content delivery.
   
   Network Functions (NFs): Components that provide specific function
   within a network.  NFs are often combined in a specific sequence to
   deliver services.
   
   Infrastructure Resources: The hardware and necessary software for
   hosting and connecting NFs. These resources may include computing
   hardware, storage capacity, network resources (e.g. links and 
   switching/routing devices enabling network connectivity), and 
   physical assets for radio access.
   
   Service Provider: A server network or collection of server 
   networks.
   
   Consumer: Any application, client network, or customer of a service
   provider
   
   Service Level Agreement (SLA): An agreement between a consumer and
   service provider that describes the quality with which features 
   and functions are to be delivered.  It may include measures of 
   bandwidth, latency, and jitter; the types of service (such as the
   network service functions or billing) to be executed; the location,
   nature, and quantities of services (such as the amount and location
   of compute resources and the accelerators require).
   
   Network Slice: An agreement between a consumer and a service 
   provider to deliver network resources according to a specific service
   level agreement.


2. Requirements for Network Slicing

   The concept of network slicing is considered a key capability for 
   future networks and, to serve customers with a wide variety of 
   different service needs, in term of latency, reliability, capacity,
   and function specific capabilities. 
   
   This section outlines the key capabilities required, and further 
   discussed in [ngmn-network-slicing], [network-slice-5g], 
   [3gpp.28.801] and [onf-tr526], to realise network slicing in an IETF
   technology network.
   
2.1 Resource Slicing


King, et al.       Expires December 15, 2017               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft   ACTN Applicability to Network Slicing   June 2017


   For network slicing, it is important to consider both infrastructure
   resources and network functions.  This allows a flexible approach to
   deliver a range of services both by partitioning (slicing) the 
   available network resources to present them for use by a consumer, 
   but also by providing instances of NFs at the right locations and 
   with access to the necessary hardware, including specific compute and
   storage resources.
 
2.2 Network and Function Virtualization

   Virtualization is the abstraction of resources where the abstraction
   is made available for use by an operations entity, for example, by 
   the Network Management Station (NMS) of a consumer network.  The 
   resources to be virtualized can be physical or already virtualized, 
   supporting a recursive pattern with different abstraction layers. 
   Therefore, Virtualization is critical for network slicing as it 
   enables effective resource sharing between network slices.

   Just as server Virtualization makes virtual machines (VMs) 
   independent of the underlying physical hardware, network 
   Virtualization enables the creation of multiple isolated virtual
   networks that are completely decoupled from the underlying physical
   network, and can safely run on top of it.
 
2.3 Resource Isolation 
   
   Isolation of data and traffic is a major requirement that must be
   satisfied for certain applications to operate in concurrent network
   slices on a common shared underlying infrastructure. Therefore, 
   isolation must be understood in terms of:
   
   o Performance: Each slice is defined to meet specific service 
     requirements, usually expressed in the form of Key Performance
     Indicators (KPIs).  Performance isolation requires that service
     delivery on one network slice is not adversely impacted by 
     congestion and performance levels of other slices;
   
   o Security: Attacks or faults occurring in one slice must not have an
     impact on other slices.  Moreover, each slice must have independent
     security functions that prevent unauthorised entities to have read 
     or write access to slice-specific configuration, management, 
     accounting information, and able to record any of these attempts,
     whether authorised or not;
   
   o Management: Each slice must be independently viewed, utilised and
     managed as a separate network.
    
2.4 Control and Orchestration


King, et al.       Expires December 15, 2017               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   ACTN Applicability to Network Slicing   June 2017


   Orchestration is the overriding control method for network slicing.
   We may define orchestration as combining and coordinating multiple 
   control methods to provide an operational mechanism that can deliver
   services and control underlying resources.  In a network slicing 
   environment, an orchestrator is needed to coordinate disparate 
   processes and resources for creating, managing, and deploying the 
   end-to-end service.

   In addition, 3GPP has also developed Release 14 "Study on 
   management and orchestration of network slicing for next generation
   network" [3gpp.28.801], which defines an information model where the 
   network slice as well as physical and virtualized network functions 
   belong to the network operator domain, while the virtualized 
   resources belong to another domain operated by a Virtualization 
   infrastructure service provider.
   
   
3. Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered (TE) Networks (ACTN)

   The framework for ACTN [actn-framework] includes a reference 
   architecture that has been adapted for Figure 1 in this document, it
   describes the functional entities and methods for the coordination of
   resources across multiple domains, to provide end-to-end services, 
   components include:
   
   o Customer Network Controller (CNC);
   
   o Multi-domain Service Coordinator (MDSC);
    
   o Physical Network Controller (PNC).

                         Figure 1: ACTN Hierarchy

   ACTN facilitates end-to-end connections and provides them to the 
   user. The ACTN framework highlights how: 
   
   o Abstraction of the underlying network resources are provided to
     higher-layer applications and customers;

   o Virtualization of underlying resources, whose selection criterion
     is the allocation of those resources for the customer, application,
     or service; 

   o Creation of a virtualized environment allowing operators to view 
     and control multi-domain networks as a single virtualized network;

   o The presentation to customers of networks as a virtual network via
     open and programmable interfaces.

   The ACTN managed infrastructure are traffic engineered network 
   resources, which may include:

   o Statistical packet bandwidth;
   
   o Physical forwarding plane sources, such as: wavelengths and 
     time slots;
   
   o Forwarding and cross connect capabilities. 

   The ACTN type of network Virtualization provides customers and 
   applications (tenants) to utilise and independently control 
   allocated virtual network resources as if resources as if they
   were physically their own resource. The ACTN network is "sliced"",
   with tenants being given a different partial and abstracted 
   topology view of the physical underlying network. The capabilities
   that ACTN provides to enable slicing are outlined in Section 2 
   (Requirements for Network Slicing). 


3.1 ACTN Virtual Network as a "Network Slice" 

   To support multiple clients each with its own view of and control
   of the server network, a network operator needs to partition (or 


King, et al.       Expires December 15, 2017               [Page 7]

   "slice") the network resources.  The resulting slices can be 
   assigned to each client for guaranteed usage which is a step 
   further than shared use of common network resources. See 
   [actn-vn] for detailed ACTN VN and VNS. 

   An ACTN Virtual Network (VN) is a client view that may be considered
   a "network slice" of the ACTN managed infrastructure, and is 
   presented by the ACTN provider as a set of abstracted resources. 

   Depending on the agreement between client and provider various VN 
   operations and VN views are possible. 

   o Network Slice Creation: A VN could be pre-configured and created 
     via static or dynamic request and negotiation between customer and 
     provider. It must meet the specified SLA attributes which satisfy 
     the customer's objectives.

   o Network Slice Operations: The network slice may be further modified
     and deleted based on customer request to request changes in the 
     network resources reserved for the customer, and used to construct 
     the network slice. The customer can further act upon the network 
     slice to manager traffic flow across the network slice. 

   o Network Slice View: The VN topology from a customer point of view.
     These may be a variety of tunnels, or an entire VN topology. Such
     connections may comprise of customer end points, access links, 
     intra domain paths and inter-domain links. 

   Primitives (capabilities and messages) have been provided to support
   the different ACTN network control functions that will enable network
   slicing. These include: topology request/query, VN service request, 
   path computation and connection control, VN service policy 
   negotiation, enforcement, routing options. [actn-info]

3.2 Examples of ACTN Delivering Types of Network Slices 

   In all the examples below ACTN is the framework used to provide 
   control, management and orchestration for the network slice 
   life-cycle. These dynamic and highly flexible, end-to-end and 
   dedicated network slices utilising common physical infrastructure,
   and according to vertical-specific requirements. The following 
   example provides three examples of using ACTN to achieve different
   scenarios of ACTN for network slicing g. All three scenarios can be
   scaled up capacity and topology changes, customer requirements 
   change.

   ACTN Provides virtual connections between multiple customer 
   locations, requested via Virtual Private Line (VPL) requester
   (CNC-A), are provided. Benefits of this model include:
   
   o Automated: the service set-up and operation is network provider 
     managed;
     
   o Virtual: the private line is seamlessly extended from customers 
     Site A (vCE1 to vCE2) and Site B (vCE2 to vCE2) across the 
     ACTN-managed WAN to Site C;
   
   o Agile: on-demand where the customer needs connectivity and 
     fully adjustable bandwidth.

3.2.3 ACTN Used to Deliver a Virtual Customer Network

   In this example ACTN provides a virtual network resource to the 
   customer. This resource is customer managed. Empowering the tenant
   to control allocated slice  (recursively). Benefits of this model 
   include: 

   o The MDSC provides the topology as part of the customer view so 
     that the the customer can control their network slice to fit their
     needs;
     
   o Resource isolation, each customer network slice is fixed and will
     not be affected by changes to other customer network slices;

   o Applications can interact with their assigned network slice 
     directly, the customer may implement their own network control 
     method and traffic prioritization, manage their own addressing 
     scheme, and further slice their assigned network resource;   
   
   o The network slice may also include specific capability nodes, 
     delivered as Physical Network Functions (PNFs) or Virtual Network
     Functions (VNFs).

3.3 Network Slice Service Mapping from TE to ACTN VN Models

   The role of TE-service mapping model [te-service-mapping] is to 
   create a binding relationship across a Layer-3 Service Model [l3sm], 
   Layer-2 Service Model and TE Tunnel model, via a generic ACTN Virtual
   Network (VN) model [actn-vn]. 
   
   The ACTN VN YANG model is a generic virtual network service
   model that allows customers (internal or external) to create a VN
   that meets the customer's service objective with various
   constraints.

   The TE-service mapping model is needed to bind L3VPN specific 
   service model with TE-specific parameters. This binding
   will facilitate a seamless service operation with underlay-TE
   network visibility. The TE-service model developed in this document
   can also be extended to support other services including L2SM, and 
   future transport network service models.

   Editors note - We plan to provide a list of models available and 
   their relationships/dependencies. We will also provide a vertical
   hierarchy of how these models may be used between functional 
   components in ACTN.
                                                                

4. IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests for action by IANA.


5. Security Considerations

   Network slicing involves the control of network resources in order
   to meet the service requirements of consumers.  In some deployment
   models, the consumer is able to directly request modification in 
   the behaviour of resources owned and operated by a service provider. 
   Such changes could significantly affect the service provider's 
   ability to provide services to other consumers.  Furthermore, the
   resources allocated for or consumed by a consumer will normally be
   billable by the service provider.

   Therefore, it is crucial that the mechanisms used in any network 
   slicing system allow for authentication of requests, security of 
   those requests, and tracking of resource allocations.

   It should also be noted that while the partitioning or slicing of
   resources is virtual, the consumers expect and require that there
   is no risk of leakage of data from one slice to another, no 
   transfer of knowledge of the structure or even existence of other

   slices, and that changes to one slice (under the control of one 
   consumer) should not have detrimental effects on the operation of
   other slices (whether under control of different or the same 
   consumers) beyond the limits allowed within the SLA.  Thus, slices
   are assumed to be private and to provide the appearance of genuine
   physical connectivity.

   ACTN operates using the [netconf] or [restconf] protocols and 
   assumes the security characteristics of those protocols.  
   Deployment models for ACTN should fully explore the authentication
   and other security aspects before networks start to carry live 
   traffic.
