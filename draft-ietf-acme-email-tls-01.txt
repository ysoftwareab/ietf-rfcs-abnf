1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-acme-acme] is a mechanism for automating certificate
   management on the Internet.  It enables administrative entities to
   prove effective control over resources like domain names, and
   automates the process of generating and issuing certificates.

   This document describes extensions to ACME for use by email services.
   Section 3 defines extensions for how email services (such as SMTP,
   IMAP) can get certificates for use with TLS.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Use of ACME for use by TLS-protected SMTP and IMAP services

   SMTP [RFC5321] (including SMTP Submission [RFC6409]) and IMAP
   [RFC3501] servers use TLS [RFC5246] to provide server identity
   authentication, data confidentiality and integrity services.  Such
   TLS protected email services either use STARTTLS command or run on a
   separate TLS-protected port .

   [I-D.ietf-acme-acme] defines several challenge types that can be
   extended for use by email services.  This document also defines some
   new challenge types specific to SMTP and IMAP.

   In order to use these challenges JWS [RFC7515] object used by
   [I-D.ietf-acme-acme] is extended.  The following extra requirements
   are in addition to requirements on JWS objects sent in ACME defined
   in Section 6.2 of [I-D.ietf-acme-acme]:

   1.  "service" JWS header parameter MUST be included.  See Section 3.1
       for more details.

   2.  "port" JWS header parameter MUST (SHOULD?) be included.  See
       Section 3.2 for more details.

   For example, if the client were to respond to the "dns-email-00"
   challenge, it would send the following request:

      POST /acme/authz/asdf/0 HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Content-Type: application/jose+json

      {
        "protected": base64url({
          "alg": "ES256",
          "kid": "https://example.com/acme/acct/1",
          "nonce": "Q_s3MWoqT05TrdkM2MTDcw",
          "url": "https://example.com/acme/authz/asdf/0",
          "service": "smtp",
          "port": 25
        }),
        "payload": base64url({
          "type": "dns-email-00",
          "keyAuthorization": "IlirfxKKXA...vb29HhjjLPSggQiE"
        }),
        "signature": "7cbg5JO1Gf5YLjjF...SpkUfcdPai9uVYYU"
      }

                                 Figure 1

3.1.  "service" JWS header parameter

   The "service" JWS header parameter specifies the service for which
   TLS server certificate should be issued.  Valid values come from
   "Service Names and Transport Protocol Port Numbers" IANA registry
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-
   names-port-numbers.xhtml>.  ACME server MAY include SRV-ID [RFC6125]
   subjectAltNames in issued certificates.

   [[This parameter might have applicability beyond email services.]]

3.2.  "port" JWS header parameter

   The "port" JWS header parameter specifies the TCP port number where
   the corresponding service is running.

   [[This parameter might have applicability beyond email services.]]

3.3.  DNS challenge for email services

   "dns-email-00" is very similar to "dns-01" defined in Section 8.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-acme-acme].

   The difference between processing of "dns-email-00" and "dns-01" are
   listed below:

   1.  The TXT record used to validate this challenge is
       _<port>._<service>_acme-challenge.<domain>.  For example, for
       domain "example.com" and IMAP service running on port 993, the
       TXT record name is _993._imaps._acme-challenge.example.com.  For
       domain "example.net" and IMAP service running on port 143, the
       TXT record name is _143._imap._acme-challenge.example.next.

   2.  [[OPEN ISSUE: Should service name and port number be incorporated
       into the hash?]]

3.4.  CAPABILITY challenge for email services

   For "capability-smtp-00" challenge, ACME client (== SMTP server)
   constructs a key authorization from the "token" value provided in the
   challenge and the client's account key.  The client then computes the
   SHA-256 digest [FIPS180-4] of the key authorization.  SMTP server
   than returns the base64url encoding of this digest as a value of the
   "ACME" EHLO capability.  For example:

   250-smtp.example.com
   250-SIZE
   250-8BITMIME
   250-BINARYMIME
   250-PIPELINING
   250-HELP
   250-DSN
   250-CHUNKING
   250-AUTH SCRAM-SHA-1
   250-AUTH=SCRAM-SHA-1
   250-STARTTLS
   250-ACME gfj9Xq...Rg85nM
   250-MT-PRIORITY
   250 ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES

   Note that in the above example only presence of the ACME and possibly
   STARTTLS capabilities is relevant as far as this document is
   concerned.

   Similarly, "capability-imap-00" challenge, ACME client (== IMAP
   server) constructs a key authorization from the "token" value
   provided in the challenge and the client's account key.  The client
   then computes the SHA-256 digest [FIPS180-4] of the key
   authorization.  SMTP server than returns the base64url encoding of
   this digest as a value of the "ACME" capability:

* OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 LOGINDISABLED LITERAL+ ENABLE STARTTLS ACME=gfj9Xq...Rg85nM] Example IMAP4rev1 server ready

 or

* CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 LOGINDISABLED LITERAL+ ENABLE STARTTLS ACME=gfj9Xq...Rg85nM

   Note that in the above example only presence of the ACME and possibly
   STARTTLS capabilities is relevant as far as this document is
   concerned.

4.  Open Issues

   [[This section should be empty before publication]]

   1.  Should the same certificate be allowed to be used on both IMAP
       (143) and IMAPS (993) ports?

   2.  Add support for LMTP?

   3.  One possible alternative for issuing TLS certificates for email
       services is to define a new Identifier Type that specifies
       service@domain.  The current version of the document just reuses
       "dns".

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following ACME challenge types that
   are used with Identifier Type "dns": "dns-email", "capability-smtp"
   and "capability-imap".  The reference for all of them is this
   document.

6.  Security Considerations

   TBD.
