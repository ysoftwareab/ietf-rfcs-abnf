Abstract

   This document describes a strawman approach to using HTTP (HTTP)
   over TLS (TLS) with Digest Authentication to transport PIDF-LO
   (RFC 4119) objects.  It is a GEOPRIV transport protocol as 
   described in section 5.2 or RFC 3693 (RFC 3693)

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].


2.  Introduction

   This document describes a strawman approach for HTTP to transport
   PIDF-LO objects.  RFC 3693, Section 5.2 says the following about 
   Geopriv transport protocols:

   "A protocol that just transports the LO as a string of bits, without 
   looking at them (like an IP storage protocol could do), is not a 
   using protocol, but only a transport protocol. Nevertheless, the 
   entity or protocol that caused the transport protocol to move the 
   LO is responsible for the appropriate distribution, protection, 
   usage, retention, and storage of the LO based on the rules that 
   apply to that LO."

   While it might be possible to describe HTTP as a transport protocol
   and punt all of the requirements to the layer above HTTP, this
   document describes a layering of HTTP over TLS with Digest
   Authentication in use between client and server, so that a
   common set of mechanisms for privacy and authentication are
   established.


3. Applicability Statement

   HTTP can be used as a substrate to a number of different applications,
   and defining a set of guidelines for the transport of PIDF-LO for 
   any application which might use HTTP would be difficult or impossible.
   This document does not attempt that task.  Instead, it is limited in
   applicability to the case where a client uses an HTTP GET request
   to retrieve a PIDF-LO object from a server or uses HTTP PUT to
   publish a PIDF-LO object to a server.  No other functionality
   is covered.  This document does not describe how you would determine
   the URI of the PIDF=LO document or the appropriate server to query.

   This document does not describe HTTP as a "using protocol" which, 
   in GeoPRIV terms, is a protocol which "uses (reads or modifies)
   the Location Object".


4. Steps for retrieval

4.1 The client uses HTTPS to connect to the server.

  The client establishes an HTTPS connection to the server, as 
  described in RFC 2818.  At the TLS layer, the use of
  TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL MUST NOT be used as the CipherSuite.

4.2 The client authenticates to the server.

  The client authenticates to the server using HTTP's digest
  authentication mechanism as described in RFC 2617 and updated
  by the errata.

4.3  The client retrieves the resource.

  The client retrieves the PIDF-LO resource using an HTTP GET
  request.  


5. Steps for publication.

5.1 The client uses HTTPS to connect to the server.

  The client establishes an HTTPS connection to the server, as
  described in RFC 2818.  At the TLS layer, the use of
  TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL MUST NOT be used as the CipherSuite.

5.2 The client authenticates to the server.

  The client authenticates to the server using HTTP's digest
  authentication mechanism as described in RFC 2617 and updated
  by the errata.

5.3  The client publishes the resource.

  The client publishes the PIDF-LO resource using an HTTP PUT
  request.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not imply any actions for IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document presumes that the use of TLS as substrate to HTTP
   is sufficient to protect the privacy of the PIDF-LO content while
   in flight.  It also presumes that Digest Authentication, combined
   with the TLS-layer authentication, is sufficient to enable a client 
   and server to authenticate to one another.  There is ongoing work 
   to update Digest Authentication, and those may eventually require 
   an update to the recommended authentication method.
