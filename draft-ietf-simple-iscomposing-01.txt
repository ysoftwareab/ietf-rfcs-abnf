Abstract

   In instant messaging (IM) systems, it is useful to know during an IM
   conversation that the other party is composing a message, e.g.,
   typing or recording an audio message.  This document defines a new
   status message content type and XML namespace that conveys
   information about a message being composed.  The status message can
   indicate the composition of a message of any type, including text,
   voice or video.  The status messages are delivered to the instant
   messaging recipient in the same manner as the instant messages
   themselves.

Internet-Draft                iscomposing                       May 2004


1.  Introduction

   By definition, instant messaging (IM) is message-based, i.e., a user
   composes a message by typing, speaking or recording a video clip.
   This message is then sent to one or more recipients.  Unlike email,
   instant messaging is often conversational, so that the other party is
   waiting for a response.  If no response is forthcoming, a participant
   in an instant messaging conversation may erroneously assume that
   either the communication partner has left or that it is her turn to
   type again, leading to two messages "crossing on the wire".

   To avoid this uncertainty, a number of commercial instant messaging
   systems feature an "is-typing" indication that is sent as soon as one
   party starts typing a message.  In this document, we describe a
   generalized version of this indication, called isComposing.  As
   described in Section 3 in more detail, a status message is delivered
   to the instant message recipient in the same manner as the messages
   themselves.  The isComposing messages can announce the composition of
   any media type, not just text.  For example, it might be used if
   somebody is recording an audio or video clip.  In addition, it can be
   extended to convey other instant messaging user states in the future.

   The status messages are carried as XML, as instances of the XML
   schema defined in Section 6 and labeled as an application/
   im-iscomposing+xml content type.

   These status messages can be considered somewhat analogous to the
   comfort noise packets that are transmitted in silence-suppressed
   interactive voice conversations.

      Events and extensions to presence, such as PIDF [5], were also
      considered, but have a number of disadvantages.  They add more
      overhead, since an explicit and periodic subscription is required.
      For page-mode delivery, subscribing to the right user agent and
      set of messages may not be easy. An in-band, message-based
      mechanism is also easier to translate across heterogeneous instant
      messaging systems.

   The mechanism described here aims to satisfy the requirements in [6].

2.  Terminology and Conventions

   This memo makes use of the vocabulary defined in the IMPP Model
   document [1].  Terms such as CLOSED, INSTANT MESSAGE, OPEN, PRESENCE
   SERVICE, PRESENTITY, WATCHER, and WATCHER USER AGENT in this memo are
   used in the same meaning as defined therein.  The key words MUST,
   MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and
   OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP

   14, RFC 2119 [2].

   This document discusses two kinds of messages, namely the instant
   message (IM) conveying actual content between two or more users
   engaged in an instant messaging conversation, and the status message,
   described in this document, that indicates the current composing
   status to the other participants in a conversation.  We use the terms
   "content message" and "status message" for these two message types.

3.  Description

3.1  Overview

   We model the user of an instant messaging system as being in one of
   several states, in this draft limited to "idle" and "active".  By
   default, the user is in "idle" state, both before starting to compose
   a message and after sending it.

3.2  Message Composer Behavior

   Only the instant messaging user agent actively composing a content
   message generates status messages indicating the current state.  When
   the user first starts composing an content message (the actual
   instant message), the state becomes "active" and an isComposing
   status message containing a <state> element indicating "active" is
   sent to the recipient of the content message being composed.  As long
   as the user continues to produce instant message content, the user
   remains in state "active".

   There are two sender timeouts, the refresh time-out interval and the
   idle time-out interval.  The composing user MAY specify a refresh
   time-out interval measured in seconds, using the <timeout> element in
   the status message, after which the isComposing status message is
   resent to refresh the state.  The refresh period SHOULD be no shorter
   than 60 seconds.  A message composer MAY decide not to send refresh
   messages at all and thus indicate no refresh interval; this will
   cause the receiver to assume that it has gone idle after 120 seconds.
   (In most cases, the content message will have been sent by then.)

      The refresh mechanism deals with the case that the user logs off
      or the application crashes before the content message is
      completed.

   If the user stops composing for more than a configured time interval,
   the idle timeout, the state transitions to "idle" and an "idle"
   status message is sent.  When the user starts composing again while
   in "idle" state, the state transitions to "active", with the
   corresponding status message being sent.  Unless otherwise configured

   by the user, the idle timeout SHOULD have a default value of fifteen
   seconds.

   If a content message is sent before the idle threshold expires, no
   "idle" state indication is needed.  Thus, in most cases, only one
   status message is generated for each content message.  In any event,
   the message rate is limited to one status message per refresh
   threshold interval.

   The state transitions are shown in Figure 1.

3.3  Status Message Receiver Behavior

   The status message receiver uses the status messages to determine the
   state of the content message sender.  If the most recent "active"
   status message contained a <refresh> value, the refresh time-out is
   set to that value; it is 120 seconds otherwise.  The state at the
   receiver transitions from "active" to "idle" under three conditions:

   1.  A status message with status "idle" is received.
   2.  A content message is received.
   3.  The refresh interval expires.

   Receivers MUST be able to handle multiple consecutive isComposing
   messages with "active" state regardless of the refresh interval.

   The state transitions are shown in Figure 2.

3.4  Additional Status Information

   The status message contains additional optional elements to provide
   further details on the composition activity.

   The optional <lastactive> element describes the absolute time when
   the user last added or edited content.

   The optional <contenttype> element indicates what type of media the
   messaging terminal is currently composing.  It can contain either
   just a MIME media type, such as "audio" or "text", or a media type



Schulzrinne            Expires November 13, 2004                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                iscomposing                       May 2004


   and subtype, such as "text/html".  It is best understood as a hint to
   the user, not a guarantee that the actual content message will indeed
   contain only the content indicated.  It allows the human recipient to
   be prepared for the likely message format.

   The XML schema or the set of allowable state names can be extended in
   future documents.  Recipients of status messages implementing this
   specification without extensions MUST treat state tokens other than
   "idle" and "active" as "idle".

   The isComposing status message MAY be carried in CPIM messages [3].

      Such a wrapper is particularly useful if messages are relayed by a
      conference server since the CPIM message maintains the identity of
      the original composer.

4.  Using the Status Message

   The isComposing status message can be used with either page mode or
   session mode, although it is a more natural fit with session mode.
   In session mode, the status message is sent as part of the messaging
   stream.  Its usage is negotiated just like any other media type in a
   stream is negotiated, i.e., through SDP.  Sending the status messages
   within the messaging stream has several benefits.  First, it ensures
   proper ordering and synchronization with the actual content messages
   being composed.  In messaging systems that guarantee in-order
   delivery of messages, this approach avoids that message reordering
   across two delivery mechanisms has an active indication appear at the
   receiver after the actual message has been delivered.

   Secondly, end-to-end security can be applied to the messages.
   Thirdly, SDP negotiation mechanisms can be used to turn it on and off
   at any time, and even negotiate its use in a single direction at a
   time.

   Usage with page mode is also straightforward.  There, the status
   message is carried as the body of a page mode message.
   Unfortunately, there is no way to negotiate its usage, turn it on or
   off, or even be sure that the status message gets delivered before
   the actual content being composed arrives.  (However, in SIP, page
   mode is limited to one unacknowledged message, so that out-of-order
   delivery is unlikely, albeit still possible if proxies are involved.)

6.  XML Schema Definition

   An isComposing document is an XML document that MUST be well-formed
   and SHOULD be valid. isComposing documents MUST be based on XML 1.0
   and MUST be encoded using UTF-8. This specification makes use of XML
   namespaces for identifying isComposing documents. The namespace URI
   for elements defined for this purpose is a URN, using the namespace
   identifier 'ietf'. This URN is:
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:im-iscomposing

7.  Security Considerations

   The isComposing indication provides a fine-grained view of the
   activity of the entity composing and thus deserves particularly
   careful confidentiality protection so that only the intended
   destination of the message will receive the isComposing indication.

   Since the status messages are carried using the IM protocol itself,
   all security considerations of the underlying IM protocol apply also
   to the isComposing status messages.

   There are potential privacy issues in sending isComposing status
   messages before an actual conversation has been established between
   the communicating users.  A status message may be sent even if the
   user later abandons the message.  It is RECOMMENDED that isComposing
   indications in page-mode are only sent when a message is being
   composed as a reply to an earlier message.  This document does not
   prescribe how an implementation detects in page mode whether a
   message is in response to an earlier one, but elapsed time or user
   interface behavior might be used as hints.
