Internet-Draft  OAUTH suitability for SIP authentication    October 2009


Abstract

   The Open Authentication Protocol (OAUTH) provides a method for
   clients to access server resources on behalf of another party.  This
   document evaluates OAUTH's suitability as an authentication mechanism
   for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for use cases where web
   applications want to interact with SIP servers without sharing user
   credentials.

Internet-Draft  OAUTH suitability for SIP authentication    October 2009


2.  Introduction

   OAUTH is an authentication delegation protocol, that allows a client
   to access resources on a server on behalf of a resource owner.  An
   example would be a printing service -- OAUTH client -- that wants to
   access photos on a photo sharing site -- OAUTH server -- on behalf of
   a user -- OAUTH resource owner.  The resource owner does not need to
   reveal her credentials to the OAUTH client.

   In a first phase, the client obtains token credentials from the
   server.  Using these token credentials, the client can access
   resources on the server.  Currently, this is only defined for HTTP
   requests.

   SIP [RFC3261] offers some resources that could be accessed by OAUTH
   clients as well:

   o  The resource owner's identity can be used to make calls, change
      presence states, or send messages from a web application.

   o  The presence state of the resource owner's contacts can be
      retrieved, displayed, or used in a web application.

   The resource protected by OAUTH is the resource owner's SIP account
   and its associated data.  While it would be possible to use SIP as a
   way to obtain temporary OAUTH credentials and to authenticate a
   resource owner, this document focuses on the access of SIP resources.

   SIP and OAUTH

                                 Figure 1

   Figure 1 shows the intended architecture.  Triggered by the resource
   owner, the client acquires token credentials from the server.  In the
   course of this, the server authenticates the resource owner and asks
   her for authorization of the client's request.  Using the token
   credentials, the client then sends a SIP request to the server.  The
   server checks the credentials and forwards the SIP request.

2.2.  Use Cases

2.2.1.  Establishment of an MSRP session

   Some web sites implement text chat using asynchronous HTTP requests
   (AJAX).  To connect such web sites to SIP environments with SIP/MSRP
   (see [RFC4975]) clients, a gateway can use OAUTH.

   1.  The user logs into a web site and the browser loads the embedded
       javascript code.

   2.  The web site's OAUTH client initiates an OAUTH exchange with the
       user's preferred SIP provider.

   3.  The web site redirects the user's browser to the authentication
       web page of the SIP provider's OAUTH server.

   4.  The user enters her credentials.  The OAUTH server redirects her
       to the web site.

   5.  The web site translates the text chat-related HTTP requests into
       SIP and MSRP.  It adds OAUTH token credentials to the SIP
       requests it sends towards the user's preferred SIP provider.

   After this, the OAUTH server checks the token credentials for
   validity and checks if the SIP request complies to the policy the
   user has granted for this kind of transaction.  If the SIP request
   passes all checks, the OAUTH server forwards it to the subsequent SIP
   nodes.

2.2.2.  Gateway for browser-based VoIP applets

   A number of technologies exist to implement VoIP clients as browser
   applets.  To keep applet loading times low, vendors don't implement
   standard SIP, but use stripped-down variants or proprietary
   technology.

   1.  The user logs into a web site and the browser loads the embedded
       VoIP applet.

   2.  The web site's OAUTH client initiates an OAUTH exchange with the
       user's preferred SIP provider.

   3.  The web site redirects the user's browser to the authentication
       web page of the SIP provider's OAUTH server.

   4.  The user enters her credentials.  The OAUTH server redirects her
       to the web site.

   5.  The web site translates the web applets messages into SIP and
       RTP.  It adds OAUTH token credentials to the SIP requests it
       sends towards the user's preferred SIP provider.

   After this, the OAUTH server checks the token credentials for
   validity and checks if the SIP request complies to the policy the
   user has granted for this kind of transaction.  If the SIP request
   passes all checks, the OAUTH server forwards it to the subsequent SIP
   nodes.

3.  Resource Access Policies

   In HTTP, the access to a resource is basically defined by the request
   method and the request URI.  In SIP, the information that determines
   the action that needs to be policed is scattered all over the
   request.

   OAUTH -- like HTTP digest -- only signs the request method and
   request URI.  Any OAUTH extension for SIP would have to define how to
   protect the relevant parts of a SIP request.  The OAUTH server MUST
   be able to check if a request matches the resource owner's
   authorization.

3.1.  Use Cases

3.1.1.  SIP MESSAGE

   In this use case, the resource owner wants to be sure that the OAUTH
   client is only able to send a SIP MESSAGE request, but not able to
   establish calls.

   The OAUTH client redirects the resource owner's browser to the OAUTH
   server's login page.  After the resource owner successfully logged
   in, the OAUTH server asks: 'OAUTH client xy wants to send a SIP
   Instant Message Allow?  Yes / No'

   The OAUTH client receives token credentials that are only valid for
   sending a SIP MESSAGE request

   The OAUTH server checks the SIP request and the token credentials it
   carries.  If the request matches the policy associated with the token
   credential, it forwards the request

3.1.2.  MSRP Call

   In this use case, the resource owner wants to be sure, that the OAUTH
   client will only be able to make an MSRP call

   When the OAUTH client redirects the resource owner's browser to the
   OAUTH server's login page, the OAUTH server checks her credentials
   and asks: 'OAUTH client xy wants to establish an MSRP session with
   sip:xy@example.com.  Allow?  Yes/No'

   The OAUTH client receives token credentials that are only valid for
   an MSRP call to sip:xy@example.com

   The OAUTH server checks the SIP request and the token credentials it
   carries.  If the request matches the policy associated with the token

Internet-Draft  OAUTH suitability for SIP authentication    October 2009


   credential, it forwards the request.  If the OAUTH client tries to
   use the token credentials for a voice call, it rejects it.

3.2.  Requirements

   It is desirable to keep SIP extensions as close as possible to the
   original specification.

   o  OAUTH needs to define how to use SIP URIs in OAUTH signatures

   o  The OAUTH server needs a signed piece of information in the SIP
      request that tells what policy the resource owner wants it to
      apply.

   For the use cases in this document, it is sufficient to have pre-
   defined policies between OAUTH client and OAUTH server.  The policies
   can be part of the OAUTH server's API description.  Dynamic
   negotiation of policies is not required.

4.  Security Considerations

   With a SIP extension for OAUTH, the OAUTH server MUST be able to
   display to the resource owner what kind of SIP action the OAUTH
   client is intending to do.  The OAUTH server MUST be able to check
   whether the SIP request matches the policy associated with the token
   credential it carries.

   For general security considerations of OAUTH, see the OAUTH base
   document [I-D.hammer-oauth].
