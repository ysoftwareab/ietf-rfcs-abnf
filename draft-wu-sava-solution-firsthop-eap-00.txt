Internet-Draft          SAVA First-Hop Validation              June 2007


1.  Introduction

   The problem of source address validation is decomposed hierarchically
   into three levels of granularity in [I-D.wu-sava-framework] for
   discussion: first-hop, local subnet source validation, intra-AS
   source validation, and inter-AS source validation.

   The first-hop, local subnet source validation is the crucial level in
   the hierarchy when it comes to achieving "strict-validated", SAVA
   status, which means the packet can be traced back to an individual
   host that is authorized to emit packets with that source address.  An
   IP address-switch port binding solution is proposed in this document.

   It should be stressed that at this early stage, the solutions
   proposed in the solution document are not intended to pre-empt other
   work carried out by the IETF in the solution space.  Indeed,
   consensus must be reached on a framework before solution work can be
   fully undertaken.  Furthermore, it is envisaged that more than one
   solution could be devised and deployed for each of the proposed
   solution elements required under the framework, in keeping with the
   requirement for a loosely-coupled architecture and, as far as
   possible, a plug-and-play framework.

   The intention of this document is to provide some potential solution
   ideas which have been implemented on the testbed described
   in[I-D.wu-sava-testbed-experience].  Some other procedures that could
   be used as solution elements in the first-hop, local subnet source
   validation have been devised and one is introduced and discussed in
   [I-D.baker-sava-simple].


2.  First-Hop, Local Subnet Source Address Validation

2.1.  Problem Description

   The deployment of BCP38 typically requires that the source address of
   a packet entering the provider network belong to a prefix that is
   allocated to or has transit through the attached access network.  If
   there is no special consideration, one host can still spoof source
   address by sending packet with the "legal" IP address of another host
   with same IP prefix.  The goal of the First-Hop, Local Subnet source
   address validation is to solve the source address spoofing problem in
   these scenarios.  That is, to achieve "strict-validated" SAVA
   validation status, which means the packet can be traced back to an
   individual host that is authorized to emit packets with that source
   address.  See detail in [I-D.wu-sava-framework].

2.2.  Focus of the Solution

   There are several different first-hop, local subnet scenarios:
   enterprise networks with switches, home broadband access, access from
   a wireless mobile device etc.  The focus of the solution described in
   this document is enterprise networks with switches.The source address
   may be assigned to the host in a static way or a dynamic way.

   The solution tested in the SAVA testbed takes the strongest
   requirement for validation in the first-hop, local subnet.  That is,
   any IPv6 address should have a unique association with an entity that
   is specifically authorised to use that IPv6 address.  The SAVA
   testbed has implemented a solution for IPv6 only.  The principles can
   be extended to IPv4 without difficulty.


3.  An IP Address-Switch Port Binding Solution

3.1.  System Architecture

   The main idea of the solution described in this document is based on
   creating a dynamic binding between a switch port and valid source IP
   address, or a binding between MAC address, source IP address and
   switch port.

   There are four main modules of the system: Source Address Request
   Client (SARC) on the host, Source Address Validation Proxy (SAVP) on
   the switch, Source Address Management Server (SAMS) and Interface to
   the Authentication Server (IAS).  The system architecture is shown in
   Figure 1.

   o  SARC sends an IP address request to the SAMS.

   o  SAVP relays the IP address request from SARC to SAMS and the IP
      addess response from SAMS to SARC.  It maintain a binding table
      between switch port and source IP address.

   o  SAMS receives the request from SARC and generates an address
      response to SARC based on the address allocation and management
      policy of the local subnet.  It can contact to the authentication
      server for identification and access control via IAS.  The
      allocation history of the address is stored in SAMS for future
      traceback.

   o  IAS is the interface between the SAMS and authentication server.
      In many cases, the allocation and binding of IP addresses is
      performed after a process of identity discovery and application of

      access control policy.

3.2.  Key Mechanisms

   The solution's principle steps are as follows:

   1.  The SARC on the end host sends an IP address request.  The SAVP
       on the switch relays this request to the SAMS.  If the address
       has been predetermined by the end host, it still needs to put it
       in the request datagram for acceptance from SAMS.

   2.  SAMS receives the IP address request, and generates an address
       response to SARC based on the address allocation and management
       policy of the local subnet.  The allocation of the IP address is
       stored in the history database of SAMS for traceback.  If the
       allocation and binding of IP address is performed process of
       identity discovery and application of access control policy, do
       the identification via IAS.  If authorization is successful, send
       the IP address response to the SARC.

   3.  The SAVP on the access switch receives the response, and binds
       the IP address with the switch port on the binding table.  In
       addition, it forwards the issued address to SARC on the end host.

   4.  The access switch begins to filter packets sent from the end
       host.  Packets which do not conform to the tuple (IP address,
       Switch Port) are discarded.

3.3.  Discussion of Control Protocol

   The control protocol for generating binding rules of IP address and
   switch port can be an extension of DHCP, or a new protocol.  The
   allocation and binding of IP address can also performed after a
   process of access control and identification.  For the implementation
   in CNGI-CERNET2 testbed, The communication between SARC and SAVP is
   an extension of EAP, and the communication between SAVP and SAMS is
   an extension of Radius.


4.  CNGI-CERNET2 Test Experience

   The solutions outlined above have been implemented on the testbed of
   CNGI-CERNET2.  An extension of EAP is used for the communication
   between SARC and SAVP, and an extension of Radius is used for the
   communication between SAVP and SAMS.  Successful testing of the
   solution has been carried out.  A more detailed discussion is
   described in [I-D.wu-sava-testbed-experience].
