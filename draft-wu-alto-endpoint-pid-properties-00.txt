1.  Introduction

   As stated in [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol], an Endpoint is an application
   or host that is capable of communicating (sending and/or receiving
   messages) on a network.  An Endpoint is typically either a Resource
   Provider or Resource Consumer.

   With the growth of network virtualization technology, steering
   traffic through specific services nodes at different layers or
   bypassing them completely becomes important.  A service node may be
   running in its own virtualized system space or physically separated
   across hosting systems.  The information provided about these service
   nodes includes service network location (for topology creation),
   service type (e.g. firewall, load balancer, etc.) and, optionally,
   administrative information about the service functions such as load,
   capacity and operating status.  To facilitate alto service discovery
   for these service node information, the endpoint properties and cost
   needs to be extended.

   As stated in [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol], Provider-defined Identifiers
   (PIDs) is introduced to provide an indirect and network-agnostic way
   to specify an aggregation of network endpoints that may be treated
   similarly, based on network topology, type, or other properties.
   When network endpoints are aggregated at Data Center level, the
   information provided by a data center include administrative
   information such as load, capacity, operating status.

   This document proposes extending the property concept by allowing
   PIDs to have properties.

3.  PID properties

   The ALTO base protocol defines endpoint property in the form of
   (name, value) pair associated with the selected endpoint address,
   e.g., pid.  But it doesn't define any property for PID.  However it
   can be useful to report an data center's load, capacity, operating
   status when network endpoints are aggregated at Data Center level.
   This document define x new PID properties for virtualized
   infrastructure to support service topologies creation and service
   node discovery.

3.1.  PID Property Type: resourcetype

   An ALTO Server MAY define the 'resourcetype' Endpoint Property Type
   for each Network Map that it provides.

3.2.  PID Property Type: servingload

   An ALTO Server MAY define the 'servingload' Endpoint Property Type
   for each Network Map that it provides.

3.3.  PID Property Type: supportedcapacity

   An ALTO Server MAY define the 'supportedcapacity' Endpoint Property
   Type for each Network Map that it provides.

3.4.  PID Property Type: availcapacity

   An ALTO Server MAY define the 'supportedcapacity' Endpoint Property
   Type for each Network Map that it provides.

4.  Endpoint Properties Extension

   An endpoint may have various different properties.  The example
   property of an Endpoint is network location such as pid or its
   connectivity type such as ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line),
   Cable, or FTTH (Fiber To The Home).  The endpoint property can be
   used in both Map service or endpoint property service.  The base ALTO
   protocol [ALTO] has defined three endpoint properties, i.e.,
   pid,priv:,exp: (Section 7.1.1 of ALTO base specification [ALTO]).
   This document define 14 new endpoint properties for virtualized
   endpoint to support service topologies creation and service chaining.

4.1.  Endpoint Property Type: nodetype

   An ALTO Server MAY define the 'nodetype' Endpoint Property Type for
   each Network Map that it provides.  The 'nodetype' Endpoint Property
   is used to indicate the endpoint type.  The endpoint types may
   include service function enabled node, service function chain ingress
   node, service function chain egress node.

4.2.  Endpoint Property Type: servicetype

   An ALTO Server MAY define the 'servicetype' Endpoint Property Type
   for each Network Map that it provides.  The 'servicetype' Endpoint
   Property reflect service type the endpoint supports.  The service
   types may include firewall type, DPI type, NAT44 type, Load balancer
   type.

4.3.  Endpoint Property Type: forwarding class

   An ALTO Server MAY define the 'forwardingclass' Endpoint Property
   Type for each Network Map that it provides.  The 'forwardingclass'
   Endpoint Property reflects forwarding class the endpoint supports.
   The supported forwarding classes include expedited forwarding,
   assured forwarding,network control, best effort.

4.4.  Endpoint Property Type: Packetrateutilization

   An ALTO Server MAY define the 'packetrateutilization' Endpoint
   Property Type for each Network Map that it provides.  The
   'packetrateutilization' Endpoint Property is used to indicate packet
   rate utilization.

4.5.  Endpoint Property Type: bandwidthutilization

   An ALTO Server MAY define the 'bandwidthutilization' Endpoint
   Property Type for each Network Map that it provides.  The '
   bandwidthutilization ' Endpoint Property is used to indicate packet

   rate utilization.

4.6.  Endpoint Property Type: memoryutilization

   An ALTO Server MAY define the 'availablememory' Endpoint Property
   Type for each Network Map that it provides.  The ' availablememory'
   Endpoint Property is used to indicate packet rate utilization.

4.7.  Endpoint Property Type: availablememory

   An ALTO Server MAY define the 'availablememory' Endpoint Property
   Type for each Network Map that it provides.  The ' availablememory'
   Endpoint Property is used to indicate packet rate utilization.

4.8.  Endpoint Property Type: ributilization

   An ALTO Server MAY define the 'ributilization' Endpoint Property Type
   for each Network Map that it provides.  The ' ributilization '
   Endpoint Property is used to indicate packet rate utilization.

4.9.  Endpoint Property Type: fibutilization

   An ALTO Server MAY define the 'fibutilization' Endpoint Property Type
   for each Network Map that it provides.  The ' fibutilization '
   Endpoint Property is used to indicate packet rate utilization.

4.10.  Endpoint Property Type: cpuutilization

   An ALTO Server MAY define the 'cpuutilization' Endpoint Property Type
   for each Network Map that it provides.  The ' cpuutilization '
   Endpoint Property is used to indicate packet rate utilization.

4.11.  Endpoint Property Type: availablestorage

   An ALTO Server MAY define the 'ributilization' Endpoint Property Type
   for each Network Map that it provides.  The ' availablestorage '
   Endpoint Property is used to indicate packet rate utilization.

4.12.  Endpoint Property Type: supportedaclnum

   An ALTO Server MAY define the 'supportedaclnum' Endpoint Property
   Type for each Network Map that it provides. 'supportedaclnum'
   Endpoint Property reflects endpoint capability from supported ACL
   number perspective.
