UA-pix-x= <n>  
UA-pix-y= <m> 
    
   The display size of the client's device is transmitted in total  
   horizontal <n> and vertical <m> pixel number, for example: UA-pix- 
x=1024, UA-pix-y=768.  The intent is to present and allow the   
UA-res= <n>  
    
   The display device resolution is transmitted in pixels per inch.   
   For example: UA-res=72.  Certain resources such as images may have  
   similar total pixel size but differing data size and quality  
   depending on degree of compression.  UA-res can be used to resolve a  
   preferred image in this case. 
     
   The authors recognize English units are not universal, but desire to   
   avoid multiple unit definitions.   
    
UA-color=<n> 
UA-grey=<n>  
    
   The display color capabilities are indicated with feature tag and a  
   parameter <n> describing the number of color channel bits available.  
   Values of <n> are typically (but not limited to) 2, 8, or 24.  For  
   example: UA-grey=8 indicates a display capable of representing an  
   image in 256 levels of a single color, while UA-color=8 indicates a  
   display capable of representing an image with a palette of 256  
   colors.   
    
   The `default' case, implied by absence of the tag, is UA-color=24.   
   In this case any palletizing and/or half-toning is done by the  
   client. 
     
   The authors recognize the issue of color model may be raised, but  
   color model can be implied or specified within image MIME types such  
   as JPEG or TIFF.
