1.  Introduction

   An integral part of the success and adoption of the Web Real Time
   Communications (WebRTC) will be the voice and video interoperability
   between WebRTC applications.  This specification will outline the
   audio processing and codec requirements for WebRTC endpoint
   implementations.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Codec Requirements

   To ensure a baseline level of interoperability between WebRTC
   endpoints, a minimum set of required codecs are specified below.  If
   other suitable audio codecs are available for the browser to use, it
   is RECOMMENDED that they are also be included in the offer in order
   to maximize the possibility to establish the session without the need
   for audio transcoding.

   WebRTC endpoints are REQUIRED to implement the following audio
   codecs:

   o  Opus [RFC6716] with the payload format specified in
      [I-D.ietf-payload-rtp-opus].

   o  G.711 PCMA and PCMU with the payload format specified in section
      4.5.14 of [RFC3551].

Internet-Draft                WebRTC Audio                 November 2015


   o  [RFC3389] comfort noise (CN).  Receivers MUST support RFC3389 CN
      for streams encoded with G.711 or any other supported codec that
      does not provide its own CN.  Since Opus provides its own CN
      mechanism, the use of RFC3389 CN with Opus is NOT RECOMMENDED.
      Use of DTX/CN by senders is OPTIONAL.

   o  The audio/telephone-event media format as specified in [RFC4733].
      WebRTC endpoints are REQUIRED to be able to generate and consume
      the following events:

         +------------+--------------------------------+-----------+
         |Event Code  | Event Name                     | Reference |
         +------------+--------------------------------+-----------+
         | 0          | DTMF digit "0"                 |  RFC4733  |
         | 1          | DTMF digit "1"                 |  RFC4733  |
         | 2          | DTMF digit "2"                 |  RFC4733  |
         | 3          | DTMF digit "3"                 |  RFC4733  |
         | 4          | DTMF digit "4"                 |  RFC4733  |
         | 5          | DTMF digit "5"                 |  RFC4733  |
         | 6          | DTMF digit "6"                 |  RFC4733  |
         | 7          | DTMF digit "7"                 |  RFC4733  |
         | 8          | DTMF digit "8"                 |  RFC4733  |
         | 9          | DTMF digit "9"                 |  RFC4733  |
         | 10         | DTMF digit "*"                 |  RFC4733  |
         | 11         | DTMF digit "#"                 |  RFC4733  |
         +------------+--------------------------------+-----------+

   For all cases where the endpoint is able to process audio at a
   sampling rate higher than 8 kHz, it is RECOMMENDED that Opus be
   offered before PCMA/PCMU.  For Opus, all modes MUST be supported on
   the decoder side.  The choice of encoder-side modes is left to the
   implementer.  Endpoints MAY use the offer/answer mechanism to signal
   a preference for a particular mode or ptime.

   For additional information on implementing codecs other than the
   mandatory-to-implement codecs listed above, refer to
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-audio-codecs-for-interop].

4.  Audio Level

   It is desirable to standardize the "on the wire" audio level for
   speech transmission to avoid users having to manually adjust the
   playback and to facilitate mixing in conferencing applications.  It
   is also desirable to be consistent with ITU-T recommendations G.169
   and G.115, which recommend an active audio level of -19 dBm0.
   However, unlike G.169 and G.115, the audio for WebRTC is not
   constrained to have a passband specified by G.712 and can in fact be
   sampled at any sampling rate from 8 kHz to 48 kHz and up.  For this

Internet-Draft                WebRTC Audio                 November 2015


   reason, the level SHOULD be normalized by only considering
   frequencies above 300 Hz, regardless of the sampling rate used.  The
   level SHOULD also be adapted to avoid clipping, either by lowering
   the gain to a level below -19 dBm0, or through the use of a
   compressor.

   Assuming 16-bit PCM with a value of +/-32767, -19 dBm0 corresponds to
   a root mean square (RMS) level of 2600.  Only active speech should be
   considered in the RMS calculation.  If the endpoint has control over
   the entire audio capture path, as is typically the case for a regular
   phone, then it is RECOMMENDED that the gain be adjusted in such a way
   that active speech have a level of 2600 (-19 dBm0) for an average
   speaker.  If the endpoint does not have control over the entire audio
   capture, as is typically the case for a software endpoint, then the
   endpoint SHOULD use automatic gain control (AGC) to dynamically
   adjust the level to 2600 (-19 dBm0) +/- 6 dB.  For music or desktop
   sharing applications, the level SHOULD NOT be automatically adjusted
   and the endpoint SHOULD allow the user to set the gain manually.

   The RECOMMENDED filter for normalizing the signal energy is a second-
   order Butterworth filter with a 300 Hz cutoff frequency.

   It is common for the audio output on some devices to be "calibrated"
   for playing back pre-recorded "commercial" music, which is typically
   around 12 dB louder than the level recommended in this section.
   Because of this, endpoints MAY increase the gain before playback.

5.  Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC)

   It is plausible that the dominant near to mid-term WebRTC usage model
   will be people using the interactive audio and video capabilities to
   communicate with each other via web browsers running on a notebook
   computer that has built-in microphone and speakers.  The notebook-as-
   communication-device paradigm presents challenging echo cancellation
   problems, the specific remedy of which will not be mandated here.
   However, while no specific algorithm or standard will be required by
   WebRTC compatible endpoints, echo cancellation will improve the user
   experience and should be implemented by the endpoint device.

   WebRTC endpoints SHOULD include an AEC or some other form of echo
   control.  On general purpose platforms (e.g.  PC), it is common for
   the audio capture ADC and the audio playback DAC to use different
   clocks.  In these cases, such as when a webcam is used for capture
   and a separate soundcard is used for playback, the sampling rates are
   likely to differ slightly.  Endpoint AECs SHOULD be robust to such
   conditions, unless they are shipped along with hardware that
   guarantees capture and playback to be sampled from the same clock.

   Endpoints SHOULD allow the entire AEC and/or the non-linear
   processing (NLP) to be turned off for applications, such as music,
   that do not behave well with the spectral attenuation methods
   typically used in NLPs.  Similarly, endpoints SHOULD have the ability
   to detect the presence of a headset and disable echo cancellation.

   For some applications where the remote endpoint may not have an echo
   canceller, the local endpoint MAY include a far-end echo canceller,
   but if that is the case, it SHOULD be disabled by default.

6.  Legacy VoIP Interoperability

   The codec requirements above will ensure, at a minimum, voice
   interoperability capabilities between WebRTC endpoints applications
   and legacy phone systems that support G.711.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

8.  Security Considerations

   For security considerations regarding the codecs themselves please
   refer their specifications, including [RFC6716],
   [I-D.ietf-payload-rtp-opus], [RFC3551], [RFC3389], and [RFC4733].
   Likewise, consult the RTP base specification for security RTP-based
   security considerations.  WebRTC security is further discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security] and [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch] and
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage].

   Implementers should consider whether the use of VBR is appropriate
   for their application based on [RFC6562].  Encryption and
   authentication issues are beyond the scope of this document.

9.  Acknowledgements

   This draft incorporates ideas and text from various other drafts.  In
   particularly we would like to acknowledge, and say thanks for, work
   we incorporated from Harald Alvestrand and Cullen Jennings.
