1.  Introduction

   In order to respond to large-scale attacks on B5G communication
   infrastructure based on hyper-performance, hyperspace, the advanced
   security threats targeting new convergence services and intended
   super-trust-based security technology.  It can both ensure constant
   security throughout on B5G infrastructure and relate the foundations
   aim to acquire skills.  For native network management to optimize an
   adaptive B5G network based on SOAR, there are a lot of research
   fields to secure intend-based super-trust security skills and the
   related technology such as vulnerability analysis and security threat
   modeling to provide super-reliable infrastructure for B5G network,
   AI-based autonomous security and control framework to provide safe
   new convergence services in B5G, B5G-based station security to ensure
   availability of 3D mobile communication and quantum security
   technologies (PQC, QKD) of conversion methodology for B5G encryption
   system application.

   3GPP: SON (Self Organizing Networks)

   ETS/ITU-T/GSMA: Autonomous Network

   ETSI: ZSM (Zero touch network and Service Management)

   Hauwei: AND (Autonomous Driving Network)

   Juniper: SDN (Self Driving Network)

   Cisco: DNA (Digital(Data) Network Architecture)

   Ericson: ZTN (Zero Touch Network)

   Autonomous networks levels can also be divided into six different
   levels.

   Level 0 - Manual Network: The system is supported by monitoring
   function to manually execute dynamic tasks (SNMP, CLI)

   Level 1 - Assisted Network: The system executes specific and
   repetitive subtasks that are preconfigured to increase execution
   efficiency (Tack-Centric)

   Level 2 - Partial Autonomous Network: The system enables closed-loop
   O and M for specific devices based on AI models in specific external
   environments (Node-Centric)

   Level 3 - Conditional Autonomous network: L2-based system has
   functions to detect real-time environment change, specific network
   domain and intention device.  Semi-closed loop management is possible
   to optimize and adjust to the external environment (Service-Centric)

   Level 4 - Highly autonomous Network: L3-based system has capabilities
   of service- and customer-experience-centric in a more complex cross-
   domain environment.  It can analyze and make decisions based on
   predictive or active closed-loop management of the network (User-
   Centric)

   Level 5 - Fully autonomous network: The system is a fully autonomous
   network with multi-services, multi-domains and full lifecycle (Value-
   Centric)

2.2.  NWDAF (Network Data Analytics Function)

   NWDAF is one of the network functions located on the control plane in
   the SBA structure of 5GC.  It is based on 5G Core, MEC (Cloud) and
   user equipment (UE) in edge networks.  It is also used with data
   collection and data analysis depending on application function (AF)
   and Operations and Administration Maintenance (OAM).  The purpose of
   NWDAF is to simplify the complexity of interfacing with 5GC and 3rd
   analytic solution providers. 5GC-related data in NWDAF is collected
   with 5G network data and the data can be analyzed by machine learning
   and statistical analysis.  The analyzed result data is provided to
   other 5G core network functions to optimize each network function and
   to improve performance as its main function.

3.  B5G Native Network Management based on SOAR

3.1.  Purpose of B5G Native Network Management Framework

   It is necessary to verify native security element skill to analyze
   the detailed functions such as B5G wireless access, D2D and
   infrastructure virtualization.  It is also needed to analyze B5G
   global network security-based intelligence and internalization
   technology, security vulnerability in flying base station and quantum
   security for security application system.  We also propose of design
   of B5G native network management and requirement for B5G wireless
   access/D2D/infrastructure virtualization attack model, AI-based B5G
   autonomous security control of security native intelligence,
   networking security and intrusion detection in flying base station
   and quantum security for application of B5G security system.  In
   addition, security native modeling and verification are also
   necessary in B5G native network management framework.  [TM-

3.2.  Scope of B5G Native Network Management

   Above all, the first scope is to analyze of B5G wireless access/D2D/
   infrastructure virtualization elements and to define security
   requirements such as B5G wireless access, Ultra-high-density of B5G
   D2D and infrastructure virtualization.  In next scope, there are B5G
   wireless access/D2D/infrastructure virtualization attack model
   development and threat analysis, design of AI-based B5G autonomous
   security control and security intelligence internalization concept.
   It is also necessary to design networking security, intrusion
   detection element technology in flying base station and design of
   quantum security technology for B5G security application.
   Verification of the contents in advance is also additionally required
   with the following scope.
