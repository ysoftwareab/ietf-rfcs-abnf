            IASA2 Updates for Terminology and Relationships
                 draft-klensin-iasa2-2418upd-5377upd-00

Abstract

   The IASA2 effort changes the terminology associated with several
   roles and the relationships among existing bodies and functions to
   the successors of others.  In some cases, the relevant earlier
   documents address other matters, including ones that are critical to
   IETF processes, and are better dealt with by updating the relevant
   terminology or provisions rather than attempting to replace the
   earlier documents in their entirety.  This document provides those
   updates for RFCs 2418 and 5377 [[and perhaps others in later
   versions]].

Note in Draft

   There has been a recent discussion on the IASA2 list, and partially
   on the IETF one, about the desirability of completely replacing
   important procedural or IETF process definitional documents in order
   to align terminology with the new IASA model.  It has been suggested
   (by this author and others) that such changes are error-prone,
   unnecessary work, may be misleading, and may (presumably
   inadvertently) violate the WG's charter by changing IETF procedures
   for creation, review, and approval of standards for the Internet.

   With the posting deadline for IETF 103 (Bangkok) and awareness of the
   difficulty of holding a WG discussion of a problem with one or more
   documents without a concrete counterproposal in hand, this hastily-
   prepared I-D is provided for the convenience of the WG and the IETF
   community.  Should the WG decide to make use of it, a co-author or
   replacement author should be sought who would take the lead in
   smoothing rough edges, inserting references where needed, adding
   material for other specifications that should be updated, etc.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

1.  Introduction

   The 2018 transition from the original IETF Administrative Support
   Activity (IASA) to a new model renames a number of roles and tunes
   the relationships among various bodies.  These changes affect the
   terminology associated with existing definitional and procedural
   specifications without actually making substantive changes to the
   procedures or operations involved.  Rather than replacing
   ("obsoleting") the original documents where that is not strictly and

   substantively necessary, potentially creating confusion about
   references to them and risking inadvertent substantive changes, this
   document provides those updates that are required for consistency
   with the new IASA2 approach and clarifies the relationships involved.

   This version of the I-D provides the changes needed to update the
   base specifications for IETF Working Group operations and procedures
   [RFC2418] and advice to the IETF Trust [RFC5377] to reflect the IASA2
   changes.  It does not attempt to address other issues with those
   documents that have arisen as the IETF has evolved or errors have
   been detected.

2.  Overview

   The changes from the original IASA model to the iASA2 one include
   changes that, while important in their own right, affect the
   terminology used in other procedural documents without changing the
   underlining procedures or specifications of those documents.  These
   changes include

   o  Changes of titles, e.g., from "IETF Executive Director" to
      "Managing Director of the IETF Secretariat".  The IASA2
      specifications may change the underlying roles as well, but those
      changes do not affect the documents that are the subject of this
      specification.

   o  Changes of relationships. e.g, the Trustees of the IETF Trust are
      no longer simply the members of what is in principle another body
      (the IAOC, which has been eliminated) but are separately
      appointed.  In part because there is little actual change to the
      structure or responsibilities of the Trustees themselves, the
      documents that are the subject of this specification should be
      updated to eliminate assertions about the previous relationships
      but do not require more substantive chagnes.

3.  Document updates: RFC 2418

   In Section 1, paragraph 6, "The area directors sitting as a body...",
   change

      The IETF Executive Director is...

   to

      The Managing Director of the IETF Secretariat is...

   See above for explanation.

4.  Document updates: RFC 5377

   Section 1, paragraph 1  Drop "made up of the members of the IAOC
      [RFC4371]" after "board of trustees"

   Section 2, last paragraph  Drop "Appeals of the actions of the
      Trustees of the IETF Trust are governed by other documents.  As
      the Trustees are the members of the IAOC, the appeals procedure
      documented in BCP 101 (currently [RFC4371]) is applicable."
      [[CREF1: This is in need of careful checking.  Probably the
      correct change is not this one but would be a reference to
      whatever document lays out the new appeals procedures.]]

   Section 3, first paragraph  Drop ", which is made up of the members
      of the IAOC, as described in [RFC4071] and [RFC4371]".

5.  Acknowledgements

   This document was initiated as a response to perceived issues with
   efforts to replace RFC 2418 and RFC 5377 [[CREF2: Insert references
   in -01]].  It borrows extensively from the changes suggested in those
   drafts and would not have been possible without the work of Rich Salz
   and Joel Halpern in constructing the drafts and their suggested text.

6.  IANA Considerations

   [[CREF3: RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.]]

   This memo includes no requests to or actions for IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   This specification is about technical updates to IETF procedures.  It
   does not change the security of the Internet and any issues are
   identified in the documents normatively referenced.
