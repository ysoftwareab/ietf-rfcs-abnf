Abstract

   This document describes the procedures for using more than one video
   channel in SIP based systems enabling the other endpoints to
   understand the semantics of each channel.  The document describe how
   to label individual channels with a "role".  The "role" indicates the
   requirements for processing the channel and the role of the channel
   content in the SIP call.  The procedure address multipoint and point
   to point scenarios.

1.  Introduction

   The document describes the procedures for using more than one video
   channel during the conference.  The first video channel is used to
   transmit video from the main camera.  The second video channel has a
   role as described using the content attribute described in
   draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-content-01[I-D.draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-
   media-content].  Floor control is based on BFCP[I-D.ietf-xcon-bfcp]

   The procedures described in the document can be used for multipoint
   or point to point scenarios and are interoperable with the procedures
   described in ITU H.239[ITU.H239] recommendation.

3.  Dual Stream framework

   H.239[ITU.H239] is the ITU standard for implementing "People +
   Content" functionality in H.323 and H.320 systems.  H.239 specifies
   mechanisms for adding additional media channels to conferences, and
   how to control presentation video during a multipoint conference
   involving H.320/H.323 based signaling systems.  H.239 includes the
   concept of roles, a notion that assigns application semantics to the
   additional video stream explaining how the streams should be
   presented to and processed by endpoints and MCUs.  Under H.239, video
   streams are given either a role of "Live", meaning that the video
   stream is processed as a normal, bidirectional stream, or
   "Presentation", meaning that the stream is defined as a presentation
   to be distributed to all endpoints.  H.239 also makes it possible for
   users to hand-off the role of presenter between endpoints during the
   meeting using a floor control mechanism.

3.1.  Live role procedures

   The "Live" role indicates that the second video channel shall be
   distributed, managed, and presented using similar policies used on
   the main video stream.  The "Live" role is signaled using the "alt"
   content attribute from draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-content-01[I-
   D.draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-content].  The "Live" role is
   appropriate for live video of meeting participants.  The "Live" video
   channel supplements the main video channel - it should carry a stream
   which is less important to display at end-user systems than the
   Presentation channel, main channel or channels without role labels.

   "Live" video is two-way transmission; multiple devices may transmit
   "Live" video simultaneously.

   MCUs that support roles and process "Live" video streams distribute
   all live video in accordance with their application policies that
   define media distribution policies.  The recommended policy is for
   the MCUs to distribute a device's "Live" video stream to all
   participants who are also receiving the other video stream from the
   device.

   Floor control may be used on the "main" and "alt" stream as a group.

3.2.  Presentation role procedures

   The H.239 "Presentation" role is used to indicate that the video
   channel contains a presentation which is intended to be seen by all
   conference participants.  Transmission on the Presentation channel
   shall be managed by a floor control mechanism using BFCP[I-D.ietf-
   xcon-bfcp], in order to provide the one-way transmission.  Generally,

Internet-Draft                     PNC                     February 2006


   the Presentation channel when in use should carry the stream which is
   most important to display at end-user systems.  The "presentation"
   channel is described using the "slides" content attribute from
   draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-content-01[I-D.draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-
   media-content]

   For the "Presentation" role, MCUs shall distribute the presentation
   video to all devices in the conference which support the
   "Presentation" role and its associated video mode.  It is optional to
   send the presentation video to the sender.  An endpoint that receives
   the presentation SHALL not transmit video if it does not own the
   floor.  The MCU shall also manage the presentation token in a
   multipoint call (grants the token).  The MCU shall be the floor
   control server for the "Presentation" channel token.

3.2.1.  Floor management policy

   The floor control sever according to H.239 makes automatic decisions,
   there is no floor chair.  There is one floor used in this
   application.  In a multipoint conference, H.239 does not mandate a
   specific policy.  A RECOMMENDED policy for multipoint conference is
   for the floor control server to grant the floor if it is not
   assigned.  If the floor is assigned the floor control server will
   send a FloorRequestStatus with state revoke to the current floor
   owner and wait for FloorRelease message from the current owner before
   granting the floor to the requesting participant.

   In a point to point call, one of the parties is also the floor
   control server.  The other party may request the floor and the
   request will be granted if the party with the floor control server
   will not need it.

3.2.2.  Floor management for audio and video presentation

   The floor control server application can manage the video
   presentation and the main audio as a group controlled by one floor.
   In this case the MCU will treat the video stream as described in 3.2
   and the audio stream will always be in the mix even if it is
   currently not one of the highest speaker.

   The floor control server will indicate the streams controlled by the
   floor in the floor id attribute by listing both labels in the
   m-stream parameter as in the following example.

4.  Offer answer flow

4.1.  Live role using the content alt attribute

   The following is an example of an offer of two video streams.  The
   first is the main camera from the room and the second is a view of
   all the room using a second camera.

      v=0

      o=Alice 292742730 29277831 IN IP4 131.163.72.4

      a=rtpmap:31 H261/9000

      a=content:main

      label:10

      m=video 53334 RTP/AVP 31

      a=rtpmap:31 H261/9000

      a=content:alt

      a=label:11

4.2.  Presentation role with floor control

   In this scenario there are two video streams.  The first is the main
   conference video, the second is a presentation.  The right to send
   the presentation is controlled by a floor token.  One of the users or
   the MCU may initiate the floor control channel.  In the case of
   multipoint the MCU shall be the floor control server.

   The following is an example of an offer sent by a client to a MCU
   based on ietf-mmusic-sdp-bfcp[I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bfcp].

      m=application 9 TCP/BFCP *

      m=video 35100 RTP/AVP 31

      a=content:slides

      a=label:12

   The following is the answer returned by the MCU.  The MCU assign a
   floor only to the presentation channel.

      a=content:slides

   The endpoint will initiate the floor control connection to the MCU.
   When the endpoint wants to start sending presentation it will send a
   floor request as described in
   draft-ietf-xcon-bfcp[I-D.ietf-xcon-bfcp].  When the endpoint receives
   a floor request status granted, the endpoint can start sending the
   presentation.  The endpoint shall release the floor when done.
