               IUTF8 Terminal Mode in Secure Shell (SSH)
                     draft-sgtatham-secsh-iutf8-05

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 4254 by specifying a new opcode in the
   Secure Shell terminal modes encoding.  The new opcode describes the
   widely used IUTF8 terminal mode bit, which indicates that terminal I/
   O uses the UTF-8 character encoding.

1.  Introduction

   The Secure Shell (SSH) connection protocol [RFC4254] provides an
   encoding for terminal modes, used in the "pty-req" channel request
   type.

   A commonly used terminal mode is IUTF8, which indicates that the
   terminal driver should assume that terminal I/O uses the UTF-8
   character encoding [RFC3629].  This is typically used by the kernel's
   terminal driver on the server to decide how many bytes of input to
   treat as a single logical character during line editing.

   SSH currently does not provide an encoding for IUTF8.  This document
   specifies one.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  New IUTF8 opcode for terminal mode encoding

   The opcode value 42 is defined for the IUTF8 terminal mode.

   As [RFC4254] section 8 specifies for all opcodes in the range 1 to
   159, it is therefore followed by a single uint32 argument.  The value
   0 indicates that the IUTF8 mode is disabled, and the value 1
   indicates that it is enabled.

   As with all other encoded terminal modes, the client SHOULD transmit
   a value for this mode if it knows about one, and the server MAY
   ignore it.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document augments the "Encoding of Terminal Modes" list in
   section 8 of [RFC4254].

   IANA is requested to update the SSH encoded terminal modes registry
   with the following additional entry:

   opcode  mnemonic       description
   ------  --------       -----------
   42      IUTF8          Terminal input and output is assumed to be
                           encoded in UTF-8.

                                 Figure 1

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC4254] apply.  This additional
   terminal mode encoding is believed to have no security implications
   differing from the existing set of encoded terminal modes.

6.  Acknowledgements

   The authors are indebted to Colin Watson for originally suggesting
   this terminal mode in 2005, and David Madore and Jakub Jelen for
   prior implementation efforts.

   This document was written using the xml2rfc tool described in
   [RFC7749].
