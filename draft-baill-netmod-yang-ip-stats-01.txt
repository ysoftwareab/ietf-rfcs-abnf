1  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] data model for collecting
   basic IP and ICMP statistics for monitoring IPv4 and IPv6
   implementations.

   The data model defines the following IP layer statistics:

   o  ICMPv4 system statistics

   o  ICMPv6 system statistics

   o  IP interface statistics 


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  client

   o  configuration data

   o  server

   o  state data

   o  statistics


   The following terms are defined in [RFC6020] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

   o  presence container

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      data (read-write), and "ro" means state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2  IP Stats Model

   This document defines the YANG module "ietf-ip-stats" which provides
   the following IP layer statistics:

   o  ICMPv4 system statistics

   o  ICMPv6 system statistics

   o  IP interface statistics 


   The ICMPv4 system statistics are defined in the "icmpv4" container.
   It provides a small set of statistics about ICMPv4 traffic processed
   by the entire system. It is an optional node and it MAY be present
   only if IPv4 is enabled on the system.

   The ICMPv6 system statistics are defined in the "icmpv6" container.
   It provides a small set of statistics about ICMPv6 traffic (including
   MLDv2 [RFC 3810]) processed by the entire system. It is an optional
   node and it MAY be present only if IPv6 is enabled on the system.

   Both the "icmpv4" and "icmpv6" containers are child nodes of the top-
   level "system-stats" container that is intended to hold any system
   wide statistics. The "system-stats" container has the following tree
   structure:

   The IP interface statistics are defined in the "stats" containers
   belongs to a reusable "ip-if-stats" group. Such containers augment
   the YANG IP Management module [RFC 7277] and provide a basic set of
   statistics about IPv4 and IPv6 traffic received on and transmitted by
   an interface. The statistics are for a specific IP address family. Up
   to two separate set of IP statistics are supported per interface, one
   for each IP version. The IP implementation MAY also decides to
   support a single IP version per interface. The interface can be any
   IP capable interface defined in the IANA Interface Type YANG module
   [RFC 7224]. For instance, it can be: 

   o  an Ethernet interface (if:type = 'ianaift:ethernetCsmacd')

   o  a link aggregate interface (if:type = 'ianaift:ieee8023adLag')

   o  a L3 IP VLAN interface (if:type = 'ianaift:l3ipvlan')

   o  a loopback interface (if:type = 'ianaift:softwareLoopback')

   The "stats" container is an optional node and it MAY be present only
   if IPv4 and/or IPv6 is enabled on the system. The "stats" containers
   has the following tree structure:

3  Relationship to IP-MIB

   The IP-MIB defines two ICMP statistic tables: icmpStatsTable and
   icmpMsgStatsTable. The icmpStatsTable contains generic system-wide
   ICMP counters for each IP version. The icmpMsgStatsTable contains
   system-wide per-version, per-message type ICMP counters. The YANG IP
   statistics module aggregates all ICMP statistics into one container
   for each IP version. This module does not individually track all
   possible ICMP type values. It only tracks the most common ICMP types
   for each IP version and aggregate all other ICMP types into a single
   counter.

   The IP-MIB defines two IP statistics tables: ipSystemStatsTable and
   ipIfStatsTable). The ipSystemStatsTable contain objects to count the
   number of packets, fragments, datagrams and octets that a given
   system has processed for each IP version. The ipIfStatsTable contain
   objects to count the number of packets, fragments, datagrams and
   octets that a given interface has received or transmitted for each IP
   version. The data nodes defined in the "ip-if-stats" group
   corresponds to the counters defined in ipIfStatsTable. The system
   wide table ipSystemStatsTable is not defined in this data model. 


   The following tables list the YANG data nodes with corresponding
   objects in the IP-MIB.

5  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control model
   [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for particular
   NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF
   protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   readable IP statistics (read-only counters) with config false
   statement. Even though these data nodes are generally not considered
   sensitive or vulnerable, it may be desirable to limit the number of
   interfaces with IP statistic collection in some network environments.
   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   {ipv4|ipv6}/stats: These leafs are used to collect IP statistics
   about a specific interface. Enabling or collecting IP statistics on
   all IP capable interfaces on an system may have a negative impact on
   its performance or data storage capacity. The IP statistics may also
   contain sensitive operational information about the usage of the
   network.



6  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688].
   Following the format in RFC 3688, the following registration has been
   made.

       URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ip-stats

       Registrant Contact: The NETMOD WG of the IETF.

       XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.
