Abstract

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the
   Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects used for 
   managing the Line Code Specific parameters of Very High Speed 
   Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL) interfaces using Multiple Carrier 
   Modulation (MCM) Line Coding. It is an optional extension to the 
   VDSL-LINE CORE MIB RFC XXXX [RFCXXXX] which handles the line code
   independent objects.

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a 
   MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 
   58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 
   2580 [RFC2580].

2.  Overview

   This document describes an SNMP MIB module for managing the line  
   code dependent (Physical Medium Dependent) Layer of MCM VDSL Lines.
   These definitions are based upon the specifications for VDSL as 
   defined in T1E1, ETSI, and ITU documentation [T1E1311, T1E1011, 
   T1E1013, ETSI2701, ETSI2702, ITU9931, ITU9971]. Additionally the 
   protocol-dependent (and line-code dependent) management framework 
   for VDSL lines specified by DSLF has been taken into consideration
   [DSLFXXXXXX].

   The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission,
   as discussed in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 2863 [RFC2863]) section 
   of this document.  

2.1  Relationship of this MIB Module to other MIB Modules

   The relationship of the VDSL Line MIB to other MIBS and in particular
   to the IF-MIB, as presented in RFC 2863 [RFC2863], is discussed in 
   the VDSL-LINE CORE MIB RFC XXXX [RFCXXXX]. This section outlines the

2.3  Structure

   The MCM VDSL Line Extension MIB contains the following MIB group:

   o   vdslMCMGroup :

   This group supports MIB objects for defining configuration profiles
   and for montioring individual bands of Multiple Carrier Modulation 
   (MCM) VDSL modems.  It contains the following tables:
   
       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileTable 
       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxBandTable
       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileRxBandTable
       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxPSDTable 
       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxTxPSDTable 
       - vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxRxPSDTable 

   Either none, some or all of the objects in this group MAY be 
   implemented for MCM VDSL lines.

   Figure 1, below, displays the relationship of the tables in the
   vdslMCMGroup to the vdslGroup and to the ifEntry:

                    ----> vdslLineMCMConfProfileMaxRxPSDTable 1:(0..1)    

                   Figure 1: Table Relationships

     When the vdslLineCoding is set to MCM, the vdslLineConfProfileName
     which is the index of the vdslLineConfProfileEntry is also used as 
     the index to the vdslLineMCMConfProfileTxBandTable of the 
     vdslMCMGroup. The existence of an entry in any of the tables of 
     the vdslMCMGroup is optional. Either none, some or all of the 
     vdslMCMGroup tables MAY be implemented for a particular VDSL line
     entity using MCM line coding. 
     

 
2.4  Persistence

   All read-write and read-create objects defined in this MIB module
   SHOULD be stored persistently.  Following is an exhaustive list of 
   these persistent objects:

        vdslMCMConfProfileTxWindowLength
        vdslMCMConfProfileRowStatus
        vdslMCMConfProfileTxBandNumber
        vdslMCMConfProfileTxBandStart
        vdslMCMConfProfileTxBandStop
        vdslMCMConfProfileTxBandRowStatus
        vdslMCMConfProfileRxBandStart
        vdslMCMConfProfileRxBandStop
        vdslMCMConfProfileRxBandRowStatus
        vdslMCMConfProfileTxPSDTone
        vdslMCMConfProfileTxPSDPSD
        vdslMCMConfProfileTxPSDRowStatus
        vdslMCMConfProfileMaxTxPSDTone
        vdslMCMConfProfileMaxTxPSDPSD
        vdslMCMConfProfileMaxTxPSDRowStatus
        vdslMCMConfProfileMaxRxPSDTone
        vdslMCMConfProfileMaxRxPSDPSD
        vdslMCMConfProfileMaxRxPSDRowStatus
 
   It SHOULD also be noted that interface indices in this MIB are 
   maintained persistently.  VACM data relating to these SHOULD be 
   stored persistently as well [RFC2575].

    DESCRIPTION 
	"The VDSL Line core MIB found in RFC XXXX defines objects for 
	the management of a pair of VDSL transceivers at each end of 
        the VDSL line. The core MIB configures and monitors the line
        code independent parameters (TC layer) of the VDSL line.
	This MIB module is an optional extension of the core MIB and 
        defines objects for configuration and monitoring of the line 
        code specific (LCS) elements (PMD layer) for VDSL lines using 
        MCM coding. The objects in this extension MIB MUST NOT be used
        for VDSL lines using SCM line coding.

8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   VDSL layer connectivity from the Vtur will permit the subscriber 
   to manipulate both the VDSL link directly and the VDSL embedded  
   operations channel (EOC) for their own loop. For example, unchecked 
   or unfiltered fluctuations initiated by the subscriber could 
   generate sufficient notifications to potentially overwhelm either 
   the management interface to the network or the element manager.  

   For this reason, there are a number of managed objects in this MIB 
   that may contain sensitive information. 

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
   them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide 
   features for such a secure environment.

   Further, notifications generated by agents implementing this MIB
   will contain the above threshold information.  

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) objects
   which utilize the textual conventions defined in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of a MIB module which utilizes the textual conventions
   defined in this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
