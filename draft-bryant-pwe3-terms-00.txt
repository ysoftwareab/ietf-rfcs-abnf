1.  Introduction

   The following is background text for this revision only:

   At IETF-54 it was agreed that a single PWE3 terminology document
   would be generated defining common terms. My understanding is that
   PWE3 authors would then remove these common terms from their drafts
   thereby removing any conflicting definitions.

   I have derived these terms from a combination of the protocol-
   layering draft and the framework draft.

   I plan to put out a revised version before IETF-55, that will include
   feedback received.

   The draft now continues as normal:

   This document attempts to define the common terms used in PWE3.
   Documents produced by the IETF PWE3 WG use this common terminology,
   but may define additional terms unique to their technical area.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following definitions of terms.  These terms
   are illustrated in context in Figure 2.

   Attachment Circuit   The circuit or virtual circuit attaching
   (AC)                 a CE to a PE.

   Applicability        Each PW service will have an Applicability
   Statement (AS)       Statement (AS) that describes the applicability of
                        PWs for that service.

   CE-bound             The traffic direction where PW-PDUs are
                        received on a PW via the PSN, processed
                        and then sent to the destination CE.

   CE Signaling         Messages sent and received by the CEs
                        control plane.  It may be desirable or
                        even necessary for the PE to participate
                        in or monitor this signaling in order
                        to effectively emulate the service.

   Customer Edge (CE)   A device where one end of a service
                        originates and/or terminates.  The CE is not
                        aware that it is using an emulated service
                        rather than a native service.

INTERNET DRAFT       draft-bryant-pwe3-terms-00.txt         October 2002


   Encapsulation,       Each PW service will have an Encapsulation,
   Emulation and        Emulation and Maintenance Document (EEMD)
   Maintenance          that described the particulars of PWs for
   Document (EEMD)      that service, as well as the degree of
                        faithfulness to that service.

   Author note - is EEMD used anywhere other than in the architecture
   or framework document? Can it be removed?

   Forwarder (FWRD)     A PE subsystem that selects the PW to use to
                        transmit a payload received on an AC.

   Fragmentation        The action of dividing a single PDU into
                        multiple PDUs before transmission with the
                        intent of the original PDU being reassembled
                        elsewhere in the network. Fragmentation may be
                        performed in order to allow sending of packets
                        of a larger size than the network MTU which they
                        will traverse.

   Inter-working        Interactions between networks, between end
                        systems, or between parts thereof, with the
                        aim of providing a functional entity
                        capable of supporting an end-to-end
                        communication.

   Inter-working        A function that facilitates inter-working
   Function (IWF)       between two dissimilar services.  NSP may
                        perform the IWF function.
   Author note - is IWF used anywhere other than in the architecture
   or framework document? Can it be removed?

   Maximum transmission The packet size (excluding data link header)
   unit (MTU)           that an interface can be transmit without
                        needing to fragment.

   Native Service       Processing of the data received by the PE
   Processing (NSP)     from the CE before presentation to the PW
                        for transmission across the core.

   Packet Switched      Within the context of PWE3, this is a
   Network (PSN)        network using IP or MPLS as the mechanism
                        for packet forwarding.

   Protocol Data        The unit of data output to, or received
   Unit (PDU)           from, the network by a protocol layer.

   Provider Edge (PE)   A device that provides PWE3 to a CE.

INTERNET DRAFT       draft-bryant-pwe3-terms-00.txt         October 2002


   PE-bound             The traffic direction where information
                        from a CE is adapted to a PW, and PW-PDUs
                        are sent into the PSN.

   PE/PW Maintenance    Used by the PEs to set up, maintain and
                        tear down the PW.  It may be coupled with
                        CE Signaling in order to effectively manage
                        the PW.

   Pseudo Wire (PW)     A mechanism that carries the essential
                        elements of an emulated service from one PE
                        to one or more other PEs over a PSN.

   PW End Service       The interface between a PE and a CE.  This
   (PWES)               can be a physical interface like a T1 or
                        Ethernet, or a virtual interface like a VC
                        or VLAN.

   Pseudo Wire          A mechanism that emulates the essential
   Emulation Edge to    attributes of service (such as a T1 leased
   Edge (PWE3)          line or frame relay) over a PSN.

   Pseudo Wire PDU      A PDU sent on the PW that contains all of
   (PW-PDU)             the data and control information necessary
                        to emulate the desired service.

   PSN Tunnel           A tunnel across a PSN inside which one or
                        more PWs can be carried.

   PSN Tunnel           Used to set up, maintain and tear down the
   Signaling            underlying PSN tunnel.

   PW Demultiplexer     Data-plane method of identifying a PW terminating
                        at a PE.

   Tunnel               A method of transparently carrying information
                        over a network.

4.  Security Considerations

   The other documents produced by PWE3 will be manually checked to
   ensure that they do not re-define any of these terms.
