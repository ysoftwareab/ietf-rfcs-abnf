Abstract

   BGP Flowspec (RFC 8955) provides the ability to filter traffic using
   various matching components.  The NLRI format currently defined does
   not permit incremental deployment of new BGP Flowspec components.
   This draft defines a new BGP Capability to permit incremental
   deployment of such new Flowspec component types.

1.  Introduction

   BGP Flowspec [RFC8955] provides a mechanism to distribute traffic
   flow spcifications into BGP.  One general purpose of these flow
   specifications is for the distribution of firewall rules to receiving
   routers, particularly for mitigating distributed denial of service
   (DDoS) attacks.  The flow specification rules are encoded as BGP NLRI
   [RFC4271].

   The matching components of a flow specification NLRI is a serialized
   set of optional components.  The components are documented in
   [RFC8955], Section 3.  [RFC8956] defines IPv6-specific components.
   The full set of Flowspec component types is maintained in an IANA
   registry located at the IANA Flow Spec Component Types registry
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/flow-spec/flow-spec.xhtml).

   Unknown Flowspec component types require treatment as a malformed
   NLRI ([RFC8955], Section 4.2).  This is due to the lack of a
   mandatory length element for the components in the NLRI.  Without
   such a length, it is not possible to determine how to properly decode
   unknown components in the Flowspec NLRI.

   There has been active interest in the IDR Working Group to extend BGP
   Flowspec for additional purposes.  However, with this difficulty in
   being able to handle unknown components, those new features are
   unable to be deployed in a BGP Flowspec domain in an incremental
   fashion.  Either a carefully managed "flag day" deployment is
   required to avoid disrupting existing sessions, or the Flowspec
   domain is carefully managed such that devices with incompatible sets
   of known/unknown components are carefully separated in a "ships in
   the night" scenario.  Both options are fragile and operationally
   cumbersome.

   Some initial discussion has begun for a version 2 of Flowspec in
   [I-D.hares-idr-flowspec-v2].  That document may eventually address
   this incremental deployment issue, along with a number of other
   items.

   This document proposes to address the issues of incremental
   deployment of new BGP Flowspec component types via a new BGP
   Capability [RFC5492], the BGP Flowpec Capability Bits.

2.  BGP Flowspec Capability Bits

   BGP Flowspec component types are one octet in length with values in
   the range from 0..255.  The BGP Flowspec Capability Bits encode a
   bit-string where each supported component type has its respective bit
   set when the BGP Speaker is willing to receive BGP Flowspec NLRI that
   contain that component type.

   The BGP Flowspec Capability Bits Capability is encoded as follows:

   *  Capability Code of (TBD).

   *  Capability Length of 1..32.

   *  Capability Value contains a bit-string where a bit is set if the
      underlying BGP Flowspec component is willing to be accepted by BGP
      Speaker advertising this capability.

Internet-Draft          flowspec-capability-bits              April 2021


               Example encoding for Capability Value:

                 0                   1
                 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                |0|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|0|0|
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Bit 0 set to 0, bits 1..13 set to 1 showing support for all
      capabilities for IPv6 Flowspec, bits 14 and 15 are set to 0.

3.  Operation

   BGP Flowspec Capability Bits not advertised in the encoded bit-string
   are treated as if they were sent with a value of zero for that bit.

   The Capability Length reflects the number of octets it takes to
   encode the BGP Flowspec Capability Bits.  While the total number of
   octets required to represent the entire range of component types is
   only 32 octets, implementations SHOULD limit the number of octets
   transmitted to those required to encode the final one-bit.  Space in
   BGP Capabilities may be limited in some implementations depending on
   the number of capabilities to be sent.  (See
   [I-D.ietf-idr-ext-opt-param] for discussion on a feature to address
   this point.)

   Bit-values 0 and 255 SHOULD be set to zero as they are RESERVED.

   The BGP Flowspec Capability Bits Capability SHOULD be sent by a BGP
   Speaker utilizing any AFI/SAFI using BGP Flowspec encoding as defined
   in [RFC8955], or [RFC8956].

   The BGP Flowspec Capability Bits Capability MUST be sent by a BGP
   Speaker utilizing BGP Flowspec encoding with a component type not
   defined in those documents previously mentioned.  (I.e. component
   types not in the range 1..13.)

   A BGP Speaker that has received the BGP Flowspec Capability Bits
   Capability MUST NOT originate or propagate a BGP Flowspec encoded
   NLRI that contains a component types that is not present in the
   received bit-string.

   A BGP Speaker that has received a BGP Flowspec related AFI/SAFI
   without this Capability MUST treat the absence as equivalent to
   having received the Capability Bits covered by the base specification
   for its defining RFC, [RFC8955] or [RFC8956].

4.  Propagation of Known Components and Mismatch with Local Filtering
    Capabilities

   There may be circumstances where a BGP Speaker is capable of parsing
   Flowspec components that it is not capable of implementing as
   filters.  Section 4.2 of [RFC8955] specifies that:

      "All combinations of components within a single Flow Specification
      are allowed.  However, some combinations cannot match any packets
      (e.g., "ICMP Type AND Port" will never match any packets) and thus
      SHOULD NOT be propagated by BGP."

   This document updates that text to:

      "All combinations of components within a single Flow Specification
      are allowed.  However, some combinations cannot match any packets
      (e.g., "ICMP Type AND Port" will never match any packets) and thus
      SHOULD NOT be propagated by BGP.

      "When BGP Flowspec component types are understood and the operator
      determines that deployment-wide filtering intent would not be
      comporomised by propagating Flowepec routes that cannot match any
      packets, it SHOULD propagate the route in BGP.  This permits NLRI
      with known components to be propagated to downstream BGP Speakers
      in the deployment."

5.  BGP Flowspec Implications for Filtered NLRI

   BGP Flowspec NLRI encode match operations for traffic filtering
   rules.  Filtering is an ordered operation.  Since the current
   encoding of the NLRI does not supply explicit filtering order, the
   protocol imposes a forwarding order based on the contents of the
   NLRI.

   When a BGP Flowspec NLRI is not propagated due to filtering by this
   feature, or by user policy, there is the potential that the network-
   wide filtering intent may be compromised by the missing rules.  The
   exact impact of this on filtering will depend on the relative
   independence of the full set of BGP Flowspec routes in the BGP
   Flowspec routing domain.

   Operators must exercise care when deploying BGP Flowspec features
   with new component types to understand the propagation of such routes
   in their deployment, and the impact that filtering may have on the
   routes they wish to originate.

6.  Error Handling

   If a BGP Speaker implementing this document has transmitted BGP
   Flowspec Capability Bits to its peer and receives a BGP Flowspec NLRI
   with an unacceptable component (not in its bit-string), it MAY
   terminate the BGP session by sending a NOTIFICATION message.

7.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Aseem Choudhary, Jakob Heitz, Christoph Loibl, Robert
   Raszuk for their comments on this proposal.

8.  Security Considerations

   All of the Security Considerations for [RFC8955] and [RFC8956] still
   apply.

   Additionally, the BGP Flowspec Capability Bits may cause implicit
   filtering of some BGP Flowspec NLRI in a Flowspec domain.  Depending
   on the relative independence of the traffic matched by the BGP
   Flowspec rules in the ordering required by their specifications, such
   filtered NLRI may result in impact to the desired domain-wide
   filtering behaviors.

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new BGP Capability to the Capability
   Codes registry from the First Come, First Served pool.  The Reference
   for the registration is this document.  The Change Controller is
   IETF.

Appendix A.  Encoding of the Bit-String

   IETF has a mixed history in terms of how bit numbering is described.
   The format as used in this document, where the left-most bit sent on
   the wire is bit zero, is consistent with IETF PDU diagrams and also
   the SNMP BITS construct [RFC2578], Section 7.1.4.

   That said, the author is aware of how annoying the code for that
   construct can be.

   *  Are there circumstances where advertising capability bits for BGP
      Flowspec NLRI that need to vary on a per AFI-SAFI basis?
      Currently, the IANA registry is a single name space for all
      supported and proposed BGP address families.  As an example, the
      Flowspec for NVO3 feature has components that are defined that do
      not have incremental deployment issues due to being well formed
      with a length field.  However, since it still includes existing
      Flowspec filtering for the outer and inner IP headers, the issues
      addressed by this proposal still apply.
