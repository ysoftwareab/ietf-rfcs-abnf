                 draft-murchison-imap-list-myrights-01

Abstract

   This document defines an extension to the to IMAP LIST command that
   allows the client to request the set of rights that the logged-in
   user has been granted on mailboxes, along with other information
   typically returned by the LIST command.

1.  Introduction

   IMAP clients typically fetch the set of rights granted on mailboxes
   so they can expose the allowed functionality to the logged-in user.
   In order to do that, the client is forced to issue a LIST or LSUB
   command to list all available mailboxes, followed by a MYRIGHTS
   command for each mailbox found.  This document defines an extension
   to the to IMAP LIST command that is identified by the capability
   string "LIST-MYRIGHTS".  The LIST-MYRIGHTS extension allows the
   client to request the set of rights that the logged-in user has been
   granted on mailboxes, along with other information typically returned
   by the LIST command.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
   to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  MYRIGHTS Return Option to LIST Command

   [RFC4314] defines the MYRIGHTS command which is used by an IMAP
   client to determine the set of rights that the logged-in user has
   been granted on a given mailbox.  Frequently, a client will have to

Internet-Draft             IMAP LIST-MYRIGHTS                   May 2017


   look up the rights for some or all of the mailboxes returned by the
   LIST command.  Doing so in multiple MYRIGHTS commands wastes
   bandwidth and can degrade performance if the client does not pipeline
   the requests.

   This document extends the LIST command with a new return option,
   "MYRIGHTS", which allows the client to request all of the desired
   information in a single command.  For each listable mailbox matching
   the list pattern and selection options, the server MUST return an
   untagged LIST response followed by an untagged MYRIGHTS response
   containing the set of rights granted to the logged-in user.

   If the server is unable to look up the set of rights for a given
   mailbox, it MAY drop the corresponding MYRIGHTS reply.  In such a
   situation, the LIST command would still return a tagged OK reply.

4.  Examples

   In this example the "bar" mailbox doesn't exist, so it has no
   MYRIGHTS reply.

   C: A01 LIST "" % RETURN (MYRIGHTS)
   S: * LIST () "."  "INBOX"
   S: * MYRIGHTS "INBOX" lrswipkxtecdan
   S: * LIST () "." "foo"
   S: * MYRIGHTS "foo" lrs
   S: * LIST (\NonExistent) "." "bar"
   S: A01 OK List completed.

   In this example the LIST reply for the "foo" mailbox is returned
   because it has matching children, but no MYRIGHTS reply is returned
   because "foo" itself doesn't match the selection criteria.

   C: A02 LIST (SUBSCRIBED RECURSIVEMATCH) "" % RETURN (MYRIGHTS)
   S: * LIST (\Subscribed) "."  "INBOX"
   S: * MYRIGHTS "INBOX" lrswipkxtecdan
   S: * LIST () "." "foo" (CHILDINFO ("SUBSCRIBED"))
   S: A02 OK List completed.

5.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in [RFC5234].  Terms not defined here are
   taken from [RFC5258].

   return-option =/ "MYRIGHTS"
