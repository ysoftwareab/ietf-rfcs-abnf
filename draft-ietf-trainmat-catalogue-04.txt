1. Introduction

As the range of information and services on the Internet expands, so
does the potential user population.  Given the significant investment in
the network and the various networked information and data services, it
is essential that the broad spectrum of potential users are made aware
of these services.  In particular they require training in using these
facilities and in making effective use of the tools available for
searching for and retrieving information available on the global
network.

The rapid expansion of the user base has made it difficult for network
trainers to keep up with the demand for training. Librarians, Computing
Service staff and subject-based Network Support staff all have a vital
role to play in training users. Easy access to quality network training
materials and the pooling of resources will help spread the load.

The purpose of this document is to provide a catalogue of quality
Network Training Materials for use by Internet trainers.  By providing
such a collection of pointers to useful resources, it is hoped that
trainers will be relieved of much of the load of producing current
training materials.  The intention is to make this a "living document".
It will be held on-line so that each section may be updated separately
as appropriate.


2. How the information was collected

The information contained in this report was collected over the network
by volunteers from the Trainmat Working Group from the contacts for each
network training resource using the Trainmat template (see Appendix A).
The contents of this template had been discussed by the Trainmat WG at
its meetings and on the mailing list.


3. What is covered?

This catalogue covers network training materials. These are
categorised as follows:

Presentation Material:  including OHP masters, speaker's
                        hand-outs and speaker's notes

Workshop Exercises:     including workshop hand-outs as well
                        as detailed instructions for
                        undertaking hands-on exercises

Self-Paced Material:    including online tutorials

Some material such as selected User Guides, Resource Guides
and Trainer Guides are of particular use to trainers and
have been included as appropriate. The resource lists included
are those assembled for training purposes and those frequently
used or referred to in training.

Trainmat WG    Catalogue of Network Training Materials                 2

Special Online Collections of training materials are now
available and a selection of these is included.

The full list of Categories used is:

        User Guides
        Resource Guides
        Trainer Guides
        Presentation Material
        Workshop Exercises
        Self-Paced Material
        Online Collections


4. Updating information

The catalogue is available online. As this will be more up to date than
the RFC version, the online version should be used as the basis for any
updates. The WWW version of the document provides a mechanism, through
an HTML form, to send updates (and new material) to the maintainers of
this catalogue.

To access the document online you may use the World Wide Web at the
University of Adelaide (Australia)

  http://coolabah.itd.adelaide.edu.au/TrainMat/catalogue.html
  http://coolabah.itd.adelaide.edu.au/TrainMat/template.html

Or the following directory on the Network Training Materials gopher
at the University of Newcastle (UK)

  gopher://trainmat.ncl.ac.uk:7070/11/Bibliography/IETF_TERENA/

Updates to the catalogue are welcome and can be made by either
completing a template and sending it to "catalogue@itd.adelaide.edu.au"
or (preferably) by using the HTML form on the World Wide Web
   http://coolabah.itd.adelaide.edu.au/TrainMat/form.html

The new and revised entries are reviewed by a small international
editorial board made up of TRAINMAT volunteers. The updating of the
catalogue is done on a best effort basis and is subject to review.

	themselves with the Internet, how to use it, how to find
	information, and how to connect with people."

Appendix B: Notes on completing the TrainMat template

1.      Selecting a new resource for inclusion

When considering a new resource for inclusion in the Trainmat Catalogue,
you will need to ask a few questions to decide whether or not it should
be included.

1.1     Does the item belong in a Training Materials Catalogue?

This catalogue covers network training materials, including self
teaching materials, and other resources which facilitate and support
training.

A generous interpretation of what constitutes 'training materials' is
appropriate. (See also the note 3.2 on "Category".) Training can be
thought of as 'seeking to change behaviour', and if a document does try
to do that, then it can be considered for inclusion in this catalogue.
A document that leads the reader through sample exercises may come into
this category, but a reference card listing the commands to use does
not. Appropriate  resource lists to include are lists assembled for
training purposes and lists frequently used or referred to in training.

As this is an international catalogue it is generally not appropriate
to include material for specific services or networks. That said, some
national or regional network training material is of sufficient
generality to be considered for inclusion.

1.2      Is the content reasonably up-to-date and worth including?

It is intended that the catalogue contains a selection of quality
training materials, not a comprehensive list of everything available.
Some degree of "quality control" is needed on the entries. You will need
to decide whether the item is still relevant and reasonably up-to-date.
Anything which is two or more years old requires careful scrutiny.

1.3     Is it easily available?

Is there an established mechanism for obtaining it? This doesn't mean it
has to be free.


2.      Submitting a new or revised template

The template for inputting new entries to the catalogue is given in
Appendix A. The prefered method of inputting new or updated information
is via an HTML form accessible via the following URL:

        http://coolabah.itd.adelaide.edu.au/TrainMat/form.html

You will need to use a Web browser with forms capability. Input should
be quite straightforward. There are drop-down menus to help with input
to some fields.

Trainmat WG    Catalogue of Network Training Materials                81

Alternatively, completed templates may be emailed to:

        catalogue@itd.adelaide.edu.au

This mailing list is a small closed "review" group for deciding whether
or not an item should be included in the catalogue.

Please note that when you enter a new template you will be listed as the
person responsible for the entry.

The same procedures may be used by the person responsible for an entry,
to update an existing entry.


3.      Notes on completing the various fields of the template

The intention is to keep each entry reasonably short (and preferably not
more than one page in length). Descriptions and other long fields should
therefore be kept to a reasonable length. Note that fields continued on
the next line should be indented by at least one white space

Each completed template is auto-allocated a "handle" to uniquely
identify it.

3.1     Category

"Category"  should be selected from the following set:

        User Guides
        Resource Guides
        Trainer Guides
        Presentation material
        Workshop Exercises
        Self-Paced material
	On-Line Collections

Only user guides that are particularly useful in training should be
included.

Appropriate resource lists to include are lists assembled for training
purposes and lists frequently used or referred to in training.

Presentation material would include OHP masters, speaker's hand-outs
and speaker's notes.

Workshop exercises would include workshop hand-outs as well as detailed
instructions for undertaking hands-on exercises.

Self-Paced material would include online tutorials.

Online Collections are useful lists of training materials.
