pipe = pipe - ((HighACK - OldHighACK) - 
		           AmountSACKed (OldHighACK + 1, HighACK))

        (C.4) The value of pipe MUST be decremented by the number of
            newly SACKed data octets conveyed in the incoming ACK (i.e.,
            those octets that are being SACKed for the first time), as
            these octets represent data that has left the network.
