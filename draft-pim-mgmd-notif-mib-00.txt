1.  Introduction

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
    In particular, it describes notification objects used for managing
    notifications of the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP),
    version 1 [RFC1112], version 2 [RFC2236] or version 3 [RFC3376] and
    the Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) protocol version 1 [RFC2710]
    or version 2 [RFC3810].  Both protocols provide multicast membership
    discovery capability.  IGMP pertains to IP version 4 clients, and
    MLD for IP version 6 clients.
 
2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

    For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
    Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
    RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

    Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
    the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
    accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
    Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
    Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a
    MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD
    58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 
    2580 [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
    "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
    RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

    This Multicast Group Membership Discovery (MGMD) Notification MIB
    module contains three notifications that can be generated by the
    MGMD protocols:

    1.  A mgmdWrongVersion trap is sent when a general query whose IGMP
        or MLD version does not match the equivalent
        mgmdRouterInterfaceVersion. 

    2.  A mgmdInterfaceJoins trap is sent when a group membership is
        added on a interface

    3.  A mgmdGroupsExceed trap is sent when the number of groups of
        which the host is a member exceeds threshold value.

    4.  A mgmdInterfaceLastMemberLeave trap is sent when the last member
        of group leaves on interface.

    ::= { mgmdNotifications 4}


6.  Security Considerations

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This MIB introduces a new term to refer to the notification provided 
   by two existing multicast protocols, Multicast Group Membership
   Discovery.

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor            OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------            -----------------------
        mgmdNotificationMIB        { mib-2 XXX }

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.
