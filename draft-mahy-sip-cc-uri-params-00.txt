                  URI Parameters for SIP Call Control


Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
      all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026 [RFC2026].

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that
   other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
   Drafts. Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of
   six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other
   documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts

1. Abstract

   This document specifies a way for SIP User Agents to convey
   information about participants in SIP calls and conversation spaces.
   This information allows other UAs to act more intelligently and
   autonomously and prevent call control feature interaction problems.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119
   [RFC2119].


3. Overview

   This document describes new parameters in [SIP] URLs which can be
   used in the Contact header, Accept-Contact, and Reject-Contact
   headers defined in [caller-prefs], or in other SIP URLs used to
   describe the unique characteristics of a contact (for example:
   [call-package], or SIP for [presence]).  These parameters can be
   used to make intelligent decisions automatically to prevent call
   control feature interaction problems.  For example, to prevent two
   send-only automatons from spewing media at each other.  A more

                 URI Parameters for SIP Call Control


   detailed desription of the motivation for this work is desribed in
   [cc-models].

4. Conveying Call Control Attributes in the Contact Header

   This specification extends the Contact , Accept-Contact, and Reject-
   Contact headers by adding the following URI parameters.

   A User Agent which supports these extensions MAY include them in a
   Contact header during registration.  A UA which also supports
   [caller-prefs] MAY include these extensions in Accept-Contact or
   Reject-Contact headers.  A UA which supports the call package SHOULD
   include the participation and user parameters for conversation space
   participants in call package notification bodies.

4.1. Visibility Attribute

   This attribute conveys if a UA wishes to be visible among the list
   of participants in the conversation space correpsonding to the
   current call-leg.
   [Obviously a UA that wishes to remain hidden SHOULD only establish
   call-legs with other UAs that will respect that desire.]

   A UA which supports this attribute SHOULD NOT reveal the existance
   of hidden participants to others.  For example, a UA SHOULD NOT
   include hidden participants in a list of participants provided by
   call package.  A UA MAY reveal hidden information to a class of
   special users (administrator for example) via call package.

   The default value for this attribute is "visible"

   Syntax:
        "visibility" "=" <"> ( "visible" | "hidden" ) <">

   Default:
        visibility="visible"

   Examples:
        Contact: sip:recording-service@bank.com;visibility="hidden"
        Contact: sip:join-leave-announcer@conferences.com
          ;visibility="hidden"

4.2. Participation Attribute

   This attribute conveys if a participant is capable of terminating a
   session/call/conversation on its own (active) or not (passive), or
   will not contribute any unique content (none) as in the case of a
   relay, transcoder, or mixer.

   The default value for this attribute is "active"

   Syntax:
        "participation" "=" <"> ( "active" | "passive" | "none" ) <">

                 URI Parameters for SIP Call Control



   Default:
        participation="active"

   Examples:
        Contact: sip:announcement25@server.org;participation="passive"
        Contact: sip:adhoc123245@conf.domain.com;participation="none"
        Contact: sip:call4524@relay12.relaysrus.net
          ;participation="none"

4.3. Type of User Attribute

   This attribute conveys if the user is a human or
   machine/robot/automaton.  The default value for this attribute is
   "unknown".  This is

   Syntax:
        "user" = <"> ( "human" | "automaton" | "unknown") <">

   Default:
        user="unknown"

   Examples:
        Contact: sip:rmahy@voicemail.com;user=automaton
        Contact: sip:rohan@phone.cisco.com;user=human


5. Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [BNF].

   This specification adds the following extension parameters to the
   Contact, Accept-Contact, and Reject-Contact header fields.  These
   extension parameters MAY also be used extension parameters in a
   generic SIP URL.

        cc-uri-params  =  visibility | participation | user

        visibility = "visibility" "=" <"> ( "visible" | "hidden" ) <">
        user = "user" = <"> ( "human" | "automaton" | "unknown") <">
        participation = "participation" "=" <">
                        ( "active" | "passive" | "none" ) <">

6. Security Considerations

   This extension may convey possibly private information such as the
   hidden or visible status of a participant within a conversation
   space.  For obvious reasons, this information should only be shared
   with trusted parties.  In addition, UAs are encouraged to encrypt,
   authenticate, and integrity check this information using general
   purpose mechanisms.
