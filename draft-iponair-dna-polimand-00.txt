   Abstract 
    
   A hand-off is the process during which a node is handed off between 
   two mobility agents. Mobile IP hand-offs occur as a consequence of 
   lower layer (i. e., link-layer) hand-offs that signify a location 
   switch between two IP networks. For the duration of a Mobile IP 
   hand-off, a mobile node is unable to send or receive traffic. The 
   length of this disruption is considered critical because it can 
   affect the performance of communications. An additional factor that 
   is closely bound with that of Mobile IP hand-offs is that of agent 
   selection. That involves the selection of the most suitable mobility 
   agent from which a mobile node should receive service. 
   With the help of link-layer information such as signal strength, 
   signal quality and throughput it is possible to accelerate Mobile IP 
   hand-offs on one side and on the other to lead to the selection of 
   the best possible mobility agent. This draft describes a policy 
   based Mobile IP handoff decision method (POLIMAND) that allows for 
   enhanced Mobile IP handoffs and optimal agent selection based on 
   link layer information.

1. Introduction 
    
   For the duraton of Mobile IP hand-offs a mobile node is unable to 
   send or receive traffic and is therefore said to suffer network 
   service disruption. In order to reduce the duration of Mobile IP 
   hand-offs and choose the optimal mobility agent for the provision of 
   Mobile IP services, Mobile IP can benefit from link layer 
   information available in all bearer technologies (wireless or 
   wirelined). 
   In specific, in cellular and wireless LAN networks, Mobile IP hand-
   off decision making can benefit from link layer information such as 
   signal strength, signal quality and throughput for the support of 
   seamless roaming and low packet loss during handoffs. This draft 
   describes a policy based Mobile IP hand-off method (POLIMAND) that 
   considers the aforementioned link layer information that are 
   indicative of the status of any underlying bearer technology to 
   determine the terms of each hand-off. 
    
   Due to existence of a wide range of wireless bearer technologies 
   with different characteristics, POLIMAND introduces an intermediate 
   layer between Mobile IP and any bearer technologies. This layer 
   gathers and evaluates information from the various link-layers 
   generating hints towards Mobile IP. POLIMAND can monitor changes in 
   various link-layer parameters, determining tendencing or forecasting 
   upcoming changes in link state. By means of introducing thresholds 
   POLIMAND can provide link quality control for each of the underlying 
   bearer technologies separatelly. This combined with filtering of 
   mobility agent advertisements can lead to effective Mobile IP hand-
   off decision making without the need for major changes in the Mobile 
   IP protocol. 
    
   The advantages of POLIMAND are: 
    
   It provides a uniform interface for a range of heterogeneous bearer 
   technologies for the interaction with Mobile IP. 
   It may interact with Mobile IP with the help of hints that indicate 
   when and how a Mobile IP hand-off should occur. 
   If interaction with Mobile IP is not supported, it may through 
   filtering of mobility agent advertisements lead Mobile IP to perform 
   a hand-off.

3. Mobile IP Hand-offs based on Link Layer Information 
    
   There are different bearer access technologies available which 
   provide different link layer information. Different bearer access 
   technologies are current and future technologies like IEEE 
   802.11a/b/g, hiperLAN2, GSM, GPRS and UMTS. These technologies 
   implement various link layers for data communication.  
    
   Different link layer information requires a generic platform which 
   combines link layer information from different link layer systems. 
   However, a list of different link layer parameters from various 
   network systems are required that simplifies the control of Mobile 
   IP handoffs between different access domains. 
    
   Link layer parameters can be divided in Link Information, 
   Environment Information, Neighborhood Information, Link Layer 
   Management Information. The most important Link Information 
   parameters are signal strength, signal quality and throughput. 
   Signal quality is more appropriate than signal strength due to the 
   fact that signal quality contains information about the S/N ratio. 
   Throughput requires measurements during data transmission. However, 
   signal strength is appropriate to force Mobile IP handoffs between 
   different bearer access technologies.  
    
    
4. Policy based Mobile IP Handoff Decision (POLIMAND) 
    
   The interaction between link layer information and the network layer 
   to control Mobile IP handoffs is handled by POLIMAND. POLIMAND uses 
   link layer information to decide if there is a handoff from one 
   visited domain to another domain required. The following figure

   shows the interaction between link layer and POLIMAND to force 
   Mobile IP handoffs in the network layer.

   POLIMAND forces the Mobile IP handoff to change the visited domain 
   of the mobile node. Thus, a policy is required when the handoff has 
   to be forced by POLIMAND. POLIMAND combines different bearer access 
   technologies to control Mobile IP handoffs based on link layer 
   information. This is handled by POLIMAND with respect of current 
   bearer access technologies.

4.1 Link Layer Parameters for POLIMAND 
    
   Different link layer parameters can be used by POLIMAND to force 
   Mobile IP handoffs between different bearer access technologies. The 
   following link layer parameters are important for POLIMAND to decide 
   if a handoff has to be forced. 
    
4.1.1 Signal Strength 
    
   The signal strength parameter is available in most of the various 
   bearer access technologies, such as IEEE 802.11a/b/g, GSM, W-CDMA 
   and HiperLAN/2. This parameter can be used to control Mobile IP 
   handoffs between these access technologies. However, signal strength 
   does not contain any information about the quality of the signal.

   Internet Draft Policy Based Mobile IP Handoff Decision October 2003 
    
   This parameter only presents that a sender is in the coverage area 
   but the link may be very unreliable due to noise disruption. 
    
4.1.2 Signal Quality 
    
   The signal quality is a link parameter that is also available in 
   most of the bearer access technologies. This parameter contains the 
   required information about the signal to noise ratio that is 
   important to define the quality of the link. The link quality is 
   appropriate to control Mobile IP handoffs to support seamless 
   roaming with a reduction of packet loss during data transmission. 
    
4.1.3 Throughput 
    
   The throughput is a link layer parameter that is appropriate to 
   control Mobile IP handoffs. The throughput contains information 
   about the available bandwidth of a link. This is important 
   information to force a Mobile IP handoff to a visited domain that 
   provides the required bandwidth for data transmission. However, this 
   parameter is not available in different bearer access technologies. 
   Furthermore, throughput requires a measurement during data 
   transmission.    
    
4.2 Policy based Decision Function 
    
   POLIMAND defines a policy when the attached access network is no 
   longer available or it does not fulfill the required or the 
   predefined quality parameters. Signal strength is appropriate to 
   force Mobile IP handoffs between different bearer access 
   technologies. 
    
   For Mobile IP handoffs between IEEE 802.11b and GPRS the signal 
   quality is the most important link layer parameter in wireless LAN 
   systems that can be measured by the mobile node to receive 
   information about the radio condition within the wireless network 
   system. The measured value is handled by POLIMAND that is part of 
   the mobile node integration.  
    
   POLIMAND defines thresholds for the signal quality when the S/N 
   ratio is not adequate for lossless data transmission. The thresholds 
   consider the link layer characteristics when the mobile node roams 
   between different foreign networks. These thresholds are part of a 
   hysteresis that is described in the following paragraph. 
 
4.3 Hysteresis for POLIMAND 
    
   POLIMAND uses a hystersis to decide when a handoff has to be forced. 
   The hystersis is reqired to avoid ping-pong effects in marginal 
   areas between wireless domains. Ping-pong effects are responsible 
   for high packet loss during handoffs when the velocity is low or 
   wrily.

   Internet Draft Policy Based Mobile IP Handoff Decision October 2003 
    
   However, a hysteresis is required in general to force Mobile IP 
   handoffs before the wireless link breaks. Therefore, POLIMAND uses a 
   low watermark and a high watermark.  
    
   Especially, for Mobile IP handoffs between IEEE 802.11b and GPRS, 
   the low watermark defines when the mobile node leaves the coverage 
   area of wireless LAN. In this case POLIMAND forces a handoff to GPRS 
   to continue data transmission during the mobile node leaves a 
   wireless hotspot area. 
    
   The high watermark defines when the mobile node is in the coverage 
   area of a wireless hotspot area. In this case, POLIMAND forces a 
   handoff to WLAN to continue the data transmission via hotspot 
   domain. 
    
   These watermarks have to be measured and define the function of the 
   hysteresis.  
    
    
5. Interaction between POLIMAND and Network Layer 
    
   POLIMAND uses link layer information to define when a Mobile IP 
   handoff has to be forced. The control of Mobile IP handoffs is done 
   by POLIMAND and can be handled by the generation of hints for the 
   Mobile IP protocol.  
    
5.1 Using POLIMAND for Mobile IP Hints 
    
   POLIMAND generates a hint for Mobile IP to force a handoff between 
   visited domains when the signal quality of the current link is below 
   the predefined threshold. This hint allows the control of Mobile IP 
   handoffs that is based on link layer information. This is handled by 
   POLIMAND by suppressing Mobile IP agent advertisements. 
    
5.2 Suppressing Agent Advertisements for Mobile IP Handoffs 
    
   Agent advertisements are required to detect movements of the mobile 
   node. When a mobile node does not detect agent advertisements of the 
   network where it is currently attached, the mobile node forces a 
   handoff to another network that is currently available. The control 
   of agent advertisements has an impact of the connectivity of the 
   mobile node. 
    
   POLIMAND suppress agent advertisements when the link quality of the 
   current connection is below the predefined threshold. This forces 
   the mobile node to establish a handoff to another bearer due to the 
   fact that agent advertisements of the attached domain are no longer 
   available. The following figure shows that agent advertisements are 
   controlled by POLIMAND based on link layer information. When the 
   link quality is above the predefined threshold of link quality the 
   advertisements are transmitted to the network layer where Mobile IP 
   uses these advertisements for movement detection.
