Internet-Draft  PMIPv6 multihoming using 2-level prefixes      July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based mobility management
   protocol.  In here, Mobile Host (MH) does not know the changes of
   network access caused by MH movement.  That is, Mobile Access
   Gateways (MAGs) and Local Mobility Anchors (LMAs) support the whole
   mobiltiy management.  However, they do not define the protocol
   procedures for supporting multiple interfaces and flow handover in
   MH.

   This document clarifies the types of handover. and describes the
   protocol procedures about multihoming extensin of PMIPv6 in 2-level
   prefix model.


2.  Types of handover

   Even though this classification is not common, this document
   describes the types of handover to understand the protocol procedures
   easily.

   o  Inter-access Handover (IAHO)

   o  Inter-interface Handover (IIHO)

   o  Partial Flow Handover (PFHO)

   o  Full Flow Handover (FFHO)

   First, Inter-access Handover (IAHO) occurs between MAGs.  That is,
   MN's interface is not changed.  The attached MAG is only changed.

   Secondly, Inter-interface Handover (IIHO) considers the MH with
   multiple interfaces.  IIHO occurs among multiple interfaces in the
   same MH.  In this case, original interface will be broken by some
   reasons.  Therefore, all flow under control of original interface
   will be moved to the other interface.

   The IAHO and IIHO in LMA processing are same in case of the MH with
   logical interface.  That is, the HNP is assigned to logical interface
   only.  The MAC address of logical interface is informed to LMA.  LMA
   does not know the existence of multiple interfaces.

   Lastly, Paritial and Full Flow Handover (PFHO/FFHO) are used in case
   of simulteneous attachment between MAGs in MH with multiple
   interfaces.  PFHO means partial transfer among application flows.
   FFHO means all flow transfer from one interface to the other.  The
   difference between IIHO and FFHO is the policy of keeping the
   mobility session on the original interface.  FFHO keeps the mobility
   session because of the possibility of reverse flow handover.  So,
   original information in LMA or MAG will be kept for some time with
   idle(I) flag.

   In this document, new prefix model will be used to support the flow
   handover.  The next section will describe in detailss.

   This document defines and uses 2-level prefix model like the
   following figure.  In here, pref_A1 and pref_B1 are called by level 1

   prefix.  It is allocated and managed by LMA.  Especially, pref_A1 is
   a permanent prefix, which is indicated by flag(P).  It is used to
   support inter-interface and inter-access handover.  And logical
   interface will use the permanent prefix.

   On the other hand, pref_B1 is a temporal prefix, which is indicated
   by flag(T).  If the distinguished prefix ranges are assigned for
   permanet and temporal prefixes in each, these flags may be not
   required.  It is used to support flow handover. pref_B1 will be
   allocated by LMA to MAGs before initiation of mobility session.  Each
   MAG already knows the other's temporal prefixes.  And then, pref_01,
   called by level 2 prefix, will be allocated for MH.  Pref_01 will be
   allocated and managed by each MAG or LMA.  Basically MAG is better
   for distribution of load for flow management.

                   +---------+---------+---------+------+

                   | level 1 | pref_B1 |    -    |   T  |

                   | level 2 | pref_B1 | pref_01 |   T  |
                   +---------+---------+---------+------+

                      Figure 5: 2-level Prefix Model

   In the following section, HNP_x(P) and HNP_x_y(T) notation will be
   used.  In here, x means inteface identifer and y means level 2 prefix
   identifer and P/T is flag, which distinguishs the prefix.  As
   mensioned before, P means permanent prefix and T means temporal
   prefix.  The following examples will be used in this document.

   o  HNP_1(P) = pref_A1 (e.g., 2002:1:1:0::/64)

   o  HNP_2(P) = pref_A2 (e.g., 2002:1:2:0::/64)

   o  HNP_1(T) = pref_B1 (e.g., 2002:2:1:0::/64)

   o  HNP_2(T) = pref_B2 (e.g., 2002:2:2:0::/64)

   o

   o  HNP_1_1(T) = pref_B1 + pref_01 (e.g.,2002:2:1:1::/64)

   o  HNP_2_1(T) = pref_B2 + pref_01 (e.g.,2002:2:2:1::/64)

   In here, there are 2 types of prefixes: permanet and temporal.  The

   permanent prefix without the part of level 2 prefix will be allocated
   to the logical interface in order to support inter-technology
   handover.  If we do not consider the logical interface concept, the
   type of services will be checked to use the proper prefix.  Even
   though the quality of service will be decreased during MH movement,
   we do not want to support the handover and flow mobility.  In that
   case, we will use the permanent prefixes.  In other case, we will use
   the temporal prefixes.


4.  New 2-level flow identifier model

   There are 2 types of flow identifier(FID).  These flow ids are
   managed separately in MN, MAG and LMA.  That is,the uniqueness of
   flow ids are satified just in each node.

   o  Input FID (IFID) = level-1 flow id(IFID1) + level-2 flow id(IFID2)
      or none

   o  output FID(OFID) = level-1 flow id(OFID1) + level-2 flow id(OFID2)
      or none

   After PBU and PBA exchange, level-1 input flow ids are exchanged
   between MAGs and LMA.  And then, level-2 flow ids are allocated
   according to emerging each data flow.  After the receiving RA
   messages, MH gets level-1 flow id from MAG.  On the other hand, MAG
   makes level-1 flow id after the recognizing L2 attachment or the
   first data receiving form MH.  And then level-2 flow ids are
   allocated during the data transmission.

   MH decides anf forwards the data from logical interface to physical
   interfaces by referring flow ids.  And then, MAG and LMA just decides
   and forwards the service flow by using ouput flow ids.


5.  Usage scenarios for the 2-level prefix model

   This document considers the MH with multiple interfaces, each
   interface of whose has multiple prefixes.  This section describes the
   simultaneous use and horizontal handover in 2-level prefix model.

5.1.  Scenario 1 - simultaneous attachment

   This scenario considers the nearly same attachment of multiple
   interfaces.

5.1.1.  Initial Stage in scenario 1

   Initial attachment procedures of each interface are operated
   independently.  The following functions will be performed between MH
   and MAG or between MAG and LMA.

   o  The mobility session for all interfaces in MH

   o  Prefix allocation and maintenance in LMA and MAG

   o  Flow id generation and Distribution in LMA

   2.  MAG1 sends the PBU to the LMA.  In here, HI option is 1 (initial

       HNP_1(P) has been obtained from PBA message.  HNP_1_1(T) will be
       allocated by MAG1 using HNP_1(T) prefix, which had been
       distributed from LMA.

   5.  MH configures the HNP_1(P) and HNP_1_1(T) to the if1.

   6.  The if2 also does the above procedures.  After then, MH
       configures the HNP_2(P) and HNP_2_1(T) to the if2.

   7.  MH allocates HNP Address for logical Interface (LI).  HNP_1(P) or
       HNP_2(P) is randomly selected.  In here, we suppose that HNP_1(P)
       was selected.

   8.  Application services will be started.  For example, VoIP and web
       services have been started through if1.  IPTV service has been
       also started through if2.  In here, VoIP service has been
       assigned to flow1 by LMA.  The flow1 is flow identifier for VoIP
       service. flow2 for web service and flow3 for IPTV service is also
       assigned by LMA.

   9.  If we have the policy that only LI has the HNPs, the procedure 5
       and 6 are not required.  And the HNP assigend in LI is shown to
       all application services.

5.1.2.  Second Stage in scenario 1

   After initial stage, the following handover will be occured in
   according to network changes or user requirement.

   o  Inter-access Handover from MAG1 to MAG2

      *  MH: if1 is attached to network through the MAG2.

      *  MAG1: After receiving L2 hints, new tunnel may be configured
         between MAG1 and MAG2.  This tunnel is used to transfer the
         data, which are targeted to if1 through MAG1.

      *  MAG2: MAG2 sends PBU with HI(3) to the LMA.

      *  LMA: After receiving the PBU with HNP_1(P), all MAG1-related
         entries will be changed to the MAG22.  In addtion, LMA sends

         the PBA to MAG2 with HNP_1(P).

      *  MAG2: After receiving the PBA, new BULE with if1 will be added.

   o  Inter-interface Handover from if1 and if2

      *  MH: No action.

      *  MAG1: After receiving L2 hints, new tunnel may be configured
         between MAG1 and MAG2.  This tunnel is used to transfer the
         data, which are targeted to if1 through MAG1.

      *  MAG2: MAG2 sends PBU with HI(2) to the LMA.

      *  LMA: After receiving the PBU with HNP_1(P) from MAG2, all MAG1-
         related entries will be changed to the MAG2.  LMA sends the PBA
         with HNP_1(P).

      *  MAG2: After receiving the PBA, new BULE with HNP_1(P) will be
         added.

   o  Partial Flow Handover using temporal prefixes

      *  MH: VoIP service is using HNP_1_1(T) as flow identifier.
         HNP_1_2(T) for Web service and HNP_2_1(T) for IPTV service are
         used.  In this scenario, Web service will be transfered from
         if1 and if2.

      *  MAG1: After receiving the L2 hints, MAG1 and MAG2 know the user
         requirement about the partial flow handover.

      *  MAG2: MAG2 sends the PBU with HI(5).  In addition, PBU has a
         HNP option.  In HNP option, HNP_1_2(T) will be included in
         order to inform the flow handover.

      *  LMA: After receiving the PBU(HI=5) with HNP option, LMA updates
         the BCE using HNP option.  That is, LMA knows the change of web
         service flow.

      *  MAG2: After receiving the PBA, MAG2's BULE will be changed.

   o  Full Flow Handover using temporal prefixes

      *  MH: HNP_1_1(T) for VoIP service, HNP_1_2(T) for Web service and
         HNP_2_1(T) for IPTV service are used as the flow identifier.
         In this scenario, all services from if1 will be transferred to
         if2.

      *  MAG1: After receiving the L2 hints, MAG1 and MAG2 maybe know
         the user requirement about the full flow handover.

      *  MAG2: MAG2 sends the PBU with HI(5).  In addition, PBU has the
         HNP options.  In HNP options, HNP_1_1(T) and HNP_1_2(T) will be
         included in order to inform the full flow handover.  In here,
         the aggregated HNP_1(T) for HNP_1_1(T) and HNP_1_2(T) will be
         included in PBU.

      *  LMA: After receiving the PBU(HI=5) with HNP options, LMA
         updates the BCE using HNP options.  That is, LMA knows the
         transfer of all service flows.  In this case, original mobility
         session for if1 will be kept in order to support the reverse
         partial or full flow handover.

      *  MAG2: After receiving the PBA, MAG2's BULE will be changed.
