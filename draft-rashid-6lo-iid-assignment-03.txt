                  Designating 6LBR for IID Assignment
                   draft-rashid-6lo-iid-assignment-03

Abstract

   In IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), randomizing the
   interface identifier (IID) is a common practice to promote privacy.
   If there are a very large number of nodes, as has been discussed in
   several use cases, the effect will to proportionately increase the
   number of IIDs.  A duplicate address detection (DAD) cycle is needed
   for each configured IID, introducing more and more overhead into the
   network.  Each failed DAD requires the initiating node to regenerate
   a new IID and undergo the DAD cycle again.  This document proposes an
   optimized approach when higher privacy is required in a given network
   by allowing a 6LBR (6LoWPAN Border Router) to provide a unique IID,
   avoiding any potential duplication.  Such practice also prevents
   failure of time-critical applications, by enabling 6LBR to provide a
   unique IID, in case of address collision.

   Further improvements are proposed to enable multiple concurrent DAD
   cycles, and to return the randomized IID from 6LBR to 6LN in a space-
   efficient manner.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 addresses in SLAAC are formed by concatenating a network prefix,
   acquired from Router Advertisement (RA) messages, with a locally
   generated IID [RFC4862], [RFC2464].  Since the best method for
   generating IIDs varies depending on the network, none of the proposed
   mechanisms [RFC4941],[RFC7217] is considered a default mechanism.
   Using neighbour discovery (ND), the uniqueness of newly a generated
   IID is verified [RFC6775]. 6LBR performs DAD, and replies with a
   status.  A failed DAD would require the initiating 6LN (6LoWPAN node)
   to regenerate an IID and wait for another DAD cycle, until the 6LN
   successfully registers a unique address [RFC6775].

Internet-Draft       draft-rashid-6lo-IID-Assignment          March 2017


   A locally generated IID can be derived either from an embedded IEEE
   identifier [RFC4941], or randomly (based on a few variables)
   [RFC7217].  Since MAC reuse is unfortunately far more common than
   usually assumed [RFC7217][MAC-Duplication], IIDs derived from MAC
   address are likely to cause more than the expected number of DAD
   failures.  As soon as the 6LN generates an IID, it sends the NS
   (Neighbor Solicitation) message to 6LR (LLN Router).  Then 6LR
   proceeds to send an ICMPv6 based DAR (Duplicate Address Request)
   message to 6LBR.  An LN sends out a NS after checking its local cache
   for duplication; before proceeding with DAR, the 6LR also protects
   against address duplication within a locally maintained Neighbor
   Cache Entry (NCE) [RFC7217].

   Use cases including huge numbers of nodes and vast scale networks are
   discussed in [RFC5548], [RFC5827].  The use of arbitrary IIDs can
   resolve privacy concerns for a participating node, but a simple NS
   intended to be targeted to a small group of nodes can pollute a great
   deal of wireless bandwidth [I-D.vyncke-6man-mcast-not-efficient].
   Multicast NS and NA are much more frequent in large scale radio
   environment with mobile devices [I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router].
   Since the IIDs may be sporadically changed for privacy, the
   probability further increases that a duplicate IIDs would result in
   DAD failure and repeated DAD cycles.

   On the other hand, waiting for 6LN to regenerate another IID due to a
   failed DAD might lead to failure of a time-critical application.

   Address assignment can also be done using DNS (Domain Name Server),
   but doing so typically requires multicast traffic and introduces more
   control overhead.  Unlike DNS, the 6LoWPAN ND works on layer 2 and
   our proposed mechanism implicitly provides assistance to the DAD
   process.

   This document describes improvements to 6LoWPAN ND which enable 6LBR
   to grant a unique IID for failed DAD, to enable multiple concurrent
   DAD cycles, and to return an IID to 6LN in a space-efficient manner.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].  This document uses terminology from [RFC6775], [RFC2464],
   [RFC8064], and [RFC7721].

      EDAR: Extended Duplicate Address Request

      EDAC: Extended Duplicate Address Confirmation

      LSB: Least Significant Bit

3.  Likelihood of Address Collision

   The following observations have motivated the design of this
   proposal:

   o  Manufacturer may not follow a fine grained randomness in MAC
      addresses.

   o  MAC addresses shorter than 64 bits are used in various constrained
      technologies.

   o  The frequency of an IID being changed depends on the degree of
      privacy that a particular application requires.

   o  Depending upon the method by which an IID is generated using MAC
      address, or with shorter MAC addresses, address collisions may
      become much more likely.

4.  IID Assignment by 6LBR

   MAC driven IIDs [RFC2464] reduce or eliminate the need for DAD, but
   in practice such IID generation is discouraged ([RFC8064],
   [RFC7721]), as common privacy concerns still persist, for instance:

   o  Network activity correlation,

   o  Location tracking,

   o  Address scanning, and

   o  Device-specific vulnerability exploitation.

   Multiple approaches are proposed to suit different network
   constraints.  The mechanisms specified in [RFC4941], which are mainly

   based on MAC address or an appropriate simple random number
   generation algorithm can also be used to generate IID.

   Considering the scalability of a network and enabling 6LBR to
   randomize an IID, the method for IID generation specified in
   [RFC7217] SHOULD be used because this method is appropriate to
   support periodically changing IIDs.

                  Figure 1: Using RFC7217 to generate IID

   If DAD fails, the 6LBR will use public values for Prefix, Interface
   Index, and Network ID; the remaining two variables (DAD Counter,
   Randomized Secret Key) are local values.  Neighbor solicitation using
   link-local address cannot be avoided, but only the newly generated
   IID needs to be forwarded to the LN.

              Figure 2: DAD cycle when 6LBR generates an IID

   The approach in this draft is reactive rather than proactive; 6LBR
   only replies with a locally generated IID when DAD fails.

   Appendix A [RFC7217] states that a Net_Iface parameter can either be:

   o  Interface Index,



Sangi, et al.          Expires September 13, 2017               [Page 5]

   o  Interface Name,

   o  Link-Layer Address, or

   o  Logical Network Service Identity.

   EUI-64 of 6LN would be sent to 6LBR via 6LR within EARO and using
   that, a Link-Layer Address can be derived at 6LBR to input in PRF.
   For multiple interfaces, DAD_counter would be incremented as soon as
   the collision occurs.

4.1.  Advantages of proposed algorithm

   By reference to the algorithm in [RFC7217], the resulting IID offers
   the following advantages:

   o  For a given interface, same prefix and subnet would always result
      in same IID,

   o  It would always be a different IID generated when a different
      prefix is used, and

   o  The DAD_Counter parameter is incremented in case of address
      collision, so that the resulting address would be different than
      the previous address.

4.2.  Extended Duplicate Address Request (EDAR)

   The Prefix is the same throughout each LoWPAN network.  This draft
   uses that feature to reduce the size of the DAR:

   The fields are similar to DAR in [RFC6775] except:

   o  Type: 159 (TBD)

   o  Cycle: 4 out of 8 reserved bits to identify the DAD cycle between
      given 6LR and 6LBR.  The reference is used later by 6LR to extract
      IID provided by 6LBR.

   o  Unlike the DAR, the Registered IID (64 bit) is returned instead of
      Registered Address (128 bit).

4.3.  Extended Duplicate Address Confirmation (EDAC)

   EDAC reduces the space needed for returning the EUI-64:

        0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

             Figure 4: Extended Duplicate Address Confirmation

   The fields are similar to DAC in [RFC6775] except:

   o  Type: 160 (TBD)

   o  Cycle: 4 out of 8 reserved bits identify the DAD cycle between the
      6LR and 6LBR.  These bits are used later by 6LR to extract the IID
      supplied by 6LBR.

   o  In case of a failed DAD, a 6LBR-generated IID is encoded using XOR
      with EUI-64; otherwise the same EUI-64 occupies the 64 bits.

4.4.  Extended Address Registration Option

   ARO and EARO can ONLY be initiated by host and 6LR, respectively.
   [RFC6775] expects the reply of a host initiated ARO from 6LR with the
   same ARO except for changing the status bit to indicate the
   duplication detection.  EARO is introduced in this document; 6LR can
   send out this option if it receives EDAC instead of DAC from 6LBR.

              Figure 5: Extended Address Registration Option

   o  The fields are similar to ARO in [RFC6775] except:

   o  Type: 36 (TBD)

   o  EUI-64/XOR Encoding: a 64 bit IID generated by 6LBR is XOR'ed with
      EUI-64.

5.  Multiple DAD cycles

   In [RFC6775], 6LN is expected to generate an IID; so 6LR only acts on
   the first unique IID claim and silently discards any later claims for
   the same IID.  In contrast, this document enables 6LBR to assign a
   unique IID in case of a duplicate IID claim by 6LR.  For this
   purpose, a "Cycle" field is introduced to enable multiple concurrent
   DAD cycles that will be helpful for large-scale networks [RFC5548].
   At 6LN, this "Cycle" field is also used when extracting both IID and
   EUI-64 that are XOR'ed by 6LBR.  See Figure 3 and Figure 4 for the
   format of the Cycle field.

6.  XOR Encoding

   Each iteration of DAR and DAC [RFC6775] carries the entire 128 bit
   Registered Address during the DAD routine, even though the network
   Prefix is the same throughout each LoWPAN.  This document enables
   eliding the network prefix part of the Registered Address as well in
   EDAC and EARO using simple XOR encoding.  The encoded 64 bit field
   carries EUI-64 and randomized IID.  See Figure 4 and Figure 5 for the
   format of the EUI-64/XOR encoding.

   Under the proposed arrangement, 6LBR would only encode values, 6LN
   would only extract values and 6LR would do both.

   At 6LR before sending EDAR to 6LBR:

   o 6LR would use the 4 out of 8 Reserved "Cycle" bits of EDAR to keep
   track of multiple DAD cycles.  These iterations are recorded at 6LR
   and that information is used to extract IID/EUI-64 from EDAC to be
   forwarded to the appropriate 6LN.

   At 6LBR before sending to 6LR:

   o If Status = 0 (Success), then 6LBR returns EDAC using all the
   values as received from EDAR.

   o If Status = 1 (Duplicate), then 6LBR generates IID and XORs it with
   EUI-64 to return in the EDAC to 6LR.

   At 6LR before sending to 6LN:

   o If Status = 0 (Success) then keep the claimed address of 6LN as
   Destination Address for ARO to 6LN.

   o If Status = 1 (Duplicate), then match the "Cycle" bits of EDAC to
   extract (using XOR) the EUI-64 address and use the extracted address
   as the Destination Address for EARO to 6LN.

   Finally, at 6LN:

   o If Status = 0 (Success), 6LN starts using the address that it
   claimed.

   o If Status = 1 (Duplicate) then 6LN XORs the received EUI-64 address
   with its claimed EUI-64, which results in the newly generated IID
   sent by 6LBR.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  EDAR and EDAC Messages, and EARO Option

   The document requires two new ICMPv6 type numbers under the
   subregistry 'ICMPv6 "type" Numbers':

   o Extended Duplicate Address Request (159)

   o Extended Duplicate Address Confirmation (160)

   This document requires a new ND option type under the subregistry
   "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Formats":

   o Extended Address Registration Option (36)

7.2.  Additions to Status Field

   One new value is required for the "Address Registration Option Status
   Values" sub-registry under the "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option
   Formats":

            +--------+--------------------------------------------+
            | Status | Description                                |
            +--------+--------------------------------------------+
            | 0      | Success                                    |
            | 1      | Duplicate Address                          |
            | 2      | Neighbor Cache Full                        |
            | 3      | 6LBR generated IID                         |
            | 4-255  | Allocated using Standards Action [RFC5226] |
            +--------+--------------------------------------------+
                           Addition to Status bits
