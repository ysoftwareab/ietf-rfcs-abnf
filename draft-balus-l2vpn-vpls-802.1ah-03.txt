Internet-Draft         VPLS Extensions for PBB                July 2008 
    

Abstract 

   IEEE 802.1ah draft standard [IEEE802.1ah], also known as Provider 
   Backbone Bridges (PBB) defines an architecture and bridge protocols 
   for interconnection of multiple Provider Bridge Networks (PBNs). PBB 
   was defined in IEEE as a connectionless technology based on 
   multipoint VLAN tunnels. MSTP is used as the core control plane for 
   loop avoidance and load balancing. As a result, the coverage of the 
   solution is limited by STP scale in the core of large service 
   provider networks.   

   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [RFC4762] provides a solution for 
   extending Ethernet LAN services, using MPLS tunneling capabilities, 
   through a routed MPLS backbone without running (M)STP across the 
   backbone. As a result, VPLS has been deployed on a large scale in 
   service provider networks.  

   This draft discusses extensions to the VPLS model required to 
   incorporate desirable PBB components while maintaining the Service 
   Provider fit of the initial model.

1. Introduction 

   The IEEE 802.1ah model for PBB is organized around a B-component 
   handling the provider backbone MAC layer and an I-component concerned 
   with the mapping of Customer/Provider Bridge (QinQ) domain (e.g. 
   MACs, VLANs) to the provider backbone (e.g. BMACs, B-VLANs): i.e. the 
   I-component contains the boundary between the Customer and Backbone 
   MAC domains. PBB encapsulates customer frames in a provider backbone 
   Ethernet header, providing for Customer MAC hiding capabilities. 

   PBB requires the use of Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) as the 
   core control plane (B-domain) for loop avoidance and load balancing. 
   As a result, the coverage of the solution is limited by STP scale in 
   the core of large service provider networks.

Internet-Draft         VPLS Extensions for PBB                July 2008 
    

   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) provides a solution for extending 
   Ethernet LAN services, using MPLS tunneling capabilities, through a 
   routed MPLS backbone without requiring the use of (M)STP across the 
   backbone. VPLS use of the structured FEC 129 [RFC4762] also allows 
   for inter-domain, inter-provider connectivity and enables auto-
   discovery options across the network improving the service delivery 
   options.  

   VPLS creates an emulated LAN Segment using as building blocks a set 
   of Virtual Switch Instances (VSIs) interconnected using Virtual Links 
   - i.e. based on Pseudo Wires (PWs) or native Ethernet.  

   In a large scale deployment, there might be a need to split the 
   backbone domain into two or more domains using the Hierarchical-VPLS 
   (H-VPLS) model described in [RFC4762]. This may be required for 
   scalability, administrative reasons, or to provide efficient handling 
   of packet replication. In this context, VPLS scalability may be 
   improved by hiding the customer MAC addresses at the edge PEs so that 
   the core PEs (e.g. PE-rs) handle just the Provider MAC addresses.  

   This document proposes extensions to the VPLS model to allow for 
   selective inclusion of useful PBB capabilities while continuing to 
   avoid the use of MSTP in the backbone. The proposed solution 
   accommodates though the use of native Ethernet model, MSTP-based for 
   the PBBN [IEEE802.1ah] should a provider choose to deploy it.  

   Description of the framework and requirements for interoperability 
   between the IEEE and VPLS components is given in [PBB-VPLS-Interop]. 

   Specific service provider requirements often define the boundaries of 
   PBB and VPLS domains within their networks. It is not in the scope of 
   this document to specify how far in the Metro Area Network (MAN) or 
   the Wide Area Network (WAN) PBB and VPLS boundaries extend. The PBB 
   VPLS may co-exist in the same PE with non PBB services (i.e., regular 
   VPWS or VPLS using MPLS PW where PBB Customer MAC hiding and 
   aggregation functions are not required). 

   Section 2 defines the terms used to describe the extensions to the 
   regular VPLS Model. Section 3 covers the reference model for PBB VPLS 
   and gives examples of its usage to address the use cases described in 
   [PBB-VPLS-Interop]. Section 4 describes the data plane while section 
   5 and 6 deal with the auto-discovery and signaling components, 
   including the required MAC Withdraw extension.

2. Terminology 

   [IEEE802.1ah] provides terminology for Provider Backbone Bridging 
   that is briefly described also in [PBB-VPLS-Interop]. This document 
   employs specifically the following abbreviations from [IEEE802.1ah]: 

   CBP: Customer Backbone Port, the B-component port connecting to the 
   I-component. 
   PIP: Provider Instance Port, the I-component port connecting to the 
   B-component.  

   This document defines the following additional terms: 

   B-x: a VPLS component of the switching domain handling Backbone MACs 
   - e.g. B-FEC, B-PW 

   B-VPLS: a collection of VPLS components that operate in the Backbone 
   MAC domain, carrying one or multiple I-VPLS instances 

   B-VSI: A VPLS Service Instance (VSI) that participates in a B-VPLS 

   I-x: a VPLS component of the switching domain handling customer MACs 
   - e.g. I-FEC, I-PW 

   I-VPLS: a collection of VPLS components that participate in the 
   customer MAC layer - i.e. it uses the customer MAC addresses 
   (basically the destination address) to switch Ethernet frames 

   I-VSI: A VPLS Service Instance (VSI) that participates in an I-VPLS 

   PBB VPLS: an extended VPLS Service that includes PBB components  

   IB-PE: a PE that contains both I and B components 

   I-PE: a PE that contains just I component(s) 

   B-PE: a PE that contains just B component(s) and Customer Backbone 
   Ports (I-tagged CBPs - see [IEEE802.1ah]) 

   BC-PE: Backbone Core PE, a PE that contains only B component(s) and 
   Provider Network Port(s) (PNPs - see [IEEE802.1ah])

3. PBB-VPLS Reference Model 

   VPLS is defined in [RFC4762] as a collection of Virtual Switch 
   Instance(s) (VSIs) interconnected via Pseudo-Wires (PW).  

   The VPLS model described in [RFC4762] is able to accommodate 
   different types of PWs and Ethernet Attachment Circuits (AC) through 
   the use of VPLS (PW) Forwarders and a Native Service Processing (NSP) 
   module that performs AC adaptation and bridging function working with 
   the outer Ethernet MAC header. In the VPLS case the NSP module is 
   referred to as Virtual Switching Instance (VSI) [RFC4664]. 

   PBB Service is defined in [IEEE802.1ah] as a collection of two 
   components: an I-component and a B-component operating on the 
   Customer and the Backbone MAC layer, respectively. 

3.1. General Description 

   Porting both PBB functionalities to VPLS implies emulating the I and 
   B components in the VPLS NSP while maintaining the capability to 
   transport Ethernet frames over Pseudowires.  

   A PBB VPLS solution may be modeled as an "I-VSI" mapped to a "B-VSI" 
   operating on the Customer and the Backbone MAC layer, respectively, 
   as depicted in Figure 1.  

   Same as in [IEEE802.1ah], the I-VSI and its related B-VSI are 
   considered for modelling purposes as separate modules interconnected 
   through a internal or external link.  

   The I-VSI and its related B-VSI can be associated with the same type 
   of components as the regular VPLS VSI:  

   . A VPLS Forwarder identified by L2 FEC in the control plane and PW 
     service Label(s) in the data plane [RFC4762] 

   . A collection of Attachment Circuits identified using: 

          o B-VID and/or I-component Service ID (ISID) tag(s) and/or 
             port number for B-VSI [IEEE802.1ah] 

          o S-VID and/or C-VID tag(s) and/or port number for I-VSI 
             corresponding to different type of interfaces: QinQ, 
             802.1Q, port mode, same as for regular VPLS. 

   This representation of the PBB VPLS components is an abstract model 
   used in this document to help the solution description. It is up to

   document as long as they provide for solution interoperability.

   The PBB VPLS Model maintains the flexibility of associating both PWs 
   or native Ethernet ACs with I-VSI and B-VSI. In Figure 1 the 
   associated objects are referred to as I-PW/I-ETH and B-PW/B-ETH, 
   respectively. I-Q represents a QinQ interface [IEEE802.1ad], in fact

   an instantiation of an I-ETH AC used to connect to a QinQ access 
   network. The I-VPLS and B-VPLS clouds may contain either a VPLS mesh 
   or HVPLS topology as described in [RFC4762]. 

   PBB Customer MAC hiding and aggregation functions are provided by 
   encapsulating the Customer MAC frame coming from a PW or AC 
   terminating into I-VSI into a Provider Backbone Ethernet Header. 
   Figure 1 describes the example of an Ethernet/PW packet coming on a 
   regular (I-)PW into the I-VSI. The I-VSI performs the mapping of 
   Customer MACs to Backbone MACs as the frame is delivered to the B-
   VSI. The resulted PBB/PW encapsulation is described in the top right 
   side of Figure 1. 

   Same as for [IEEE802.1ah], two different use cases may be considered 
   based on the location of the I-VSI and its related B-VSI.  

   Case 1: Co-located I-VSI and B-VSI 

   Figure 1 describes the case of a PE that contains both I and B-VSIs. 
   IB-PE terminology is used as the PE performs a similar function with 
   a PBB IB-BEB - see [IEEE802.1ah]. The link between I-VSI and its 
   related B-VSI is internal to the PBB PE. 

   Case 2: Non co-located I-VSI and B-VSI 

   The I-VSI and its associated B-VSI may be also located in different 
   PE devices referred to as I-PE and B-PE, respectively, as depicted in 
   Figure 2.

   In this case, the connection between I-PE and B-PE will be an 
   external link, where the PBB Service ID (ISID) is still used to 
   determine which particular I-VSI FIB should be used to determine the 
   destination for a frame ingressing the PIP port on the I-PE.  

3.2. I-VSI to B-VSI Mapping 

   The I-VSI(s) may be mapped to the B-VSIs using an 1:1 model or many-
   to-1 (M:1) model.  

   . The 1:1 model, see Figure 1 and 2, may be chosen by a service 
     provider who is content with the level of service multiplexing 
     provided by the B-PWs.  

   . The M:1 model may be used in order to provide an additional layer 
     of aggregation where multiple customer services are transported 
     through a backbone VPLS.  

   Figure 3 shows the M:1 reference model applied to one of the most 
   common HVPLS scenario.

   The PBB VPLS is enabled in the U-PEs to hide the customer MACs from 
   the N-PEs. The U-PEs are IB-PEs where multiple I-VSIs are mapped to 
   one B-VSI. The N-PEs may be seen as playing the role of Backbone Core 
   Bridges (BCB - see [IEEE802.1ah]) hence the name of Backbone Core PE 
   (BC-PE). The B-VSI components on the U-PEs are connected to the B-
   VSIs/Regular VSIs on the N-PEs using regular Ethernet PWs (B-PWs in 
   the diagram). 

   In the (M:1) model, there are use cases where the I-VPLS domains that 
   share the same B-VPLS overlap but in most practical scenarios that is 
   not the case. A broadcast and flood containment solution may be 
   provided using [IEEE802.1ak].

   The reference model described in this section can be used to address 
   the other scenarios described in [PBB-VPLS-Interop], where an IB-PE 
   structure may be used wherever an IB-BEB function is required, an I-
   PE for I-BEB and a B-PE for a B-BEB. 

4. Data Plane 

   The PW processing function for each I-VSI and B-VSI follows the VPLS 
   model described in [RFC4762]. This section will focus on the new PBB-
   VPLS NSP functions, specifically on the interaction between the I-VSI 
   and B-VSI Modules. 

   Figure 5 represents a collection of I-VSI and B-VSI components that 
   represent the required NSP function for full PBB-VPLS processing in 
   an IB-PE. In order to describe the packet walkthrough, the I-VSI and 
   B-VSI should be seen as different switching modules (I and B). Each 
   of them may have its own set of PWs, Bridge modules and ACs.

   In order to better understand the data plane walkthrough let us 
   consider the example of a PBB packet arriving on a B-PW link. The PSN 
   header is used to carry the PBB encapsulated frame over the backbone 
   while the B-PW Service Label is used to determine the B-VSI FIB, same 
   as for regular VPLS. An example of the PBB packet for regular 
   Ethernet PW type is depicted in Figure 5 next to the B-VSI. Before 
   handling the packet to the B-VSI the PW and PSN encapsulation are 
   removed. The destination BMAC address of the packet is then mapped 
   against the B-VSI FIB to determine the Next Hop (NH) with the 
   following possible results:  

     -NH = B-ETH AC: PW encapsulation is removed but the PBB 
       encapsulation is left untouched. The packet is sent out on the 
       B-ETH AC. Regular AC processing rules apply - e.g. a B-VID may 
       be added to the backbone header.  

     -NH = another B-PW: ingress PW Encapsulation is removed and egress 
       PW encapsulation is added. The packet is sent out on the B-PW 
       (Split Horizon rules apply). 

     -NH = local I-VSI (CBP "port"): PW Encapsulation is removed and the 
       packet is passed to the I-VSI module for processing. Translation 
       of the PBB header (e.g. ISID rewrite) may be performed. 

     -NH = unknown or the destination BMAC is a Group MAC address 
       (Multicast or Broadcast): the packet is flooded to all the 
       virtual ports that are part of the B-VSI (e.g. B-PWs, ACs/B-ETH 
       or internal "link" towards local I-VSI). 

   For the packets that arrive at the I-VSI module from one of the local 
   B-VSI (ingressing the PIP "Link") the ISID demultiplexor is used to 
   determine the specific I-VSI FIB to which the packet belongs. The PBB 
   header is then removed and the destination Customer MAC (CMAC) 
   address is used to determine the Next Hop for the packet with the 
   following possible results: 

     -NH = I-ETH/I-Q (Ethernet port/Q-taged/QinQ AC): the Customer Frame 
       is sent out on the I-ETH. Regular AC processing rules apply - 
       e.g. a C-VID and/or a S-VID may be added to the packet. 

     -NH = I-PW: the frame containing just the Customer MAC and S-VID 
       and/or C-VID tags is encapsulated in the PW header before being 
       sent out on the I-PW. The S-VID and/or C-VID may or may not be 
       included in the actual encapsulated packet as per regular PW 
       processing rules. The resulted encapsulation is depicted next to 
       the I-VSI in Figure 5.

   For a packet ingressing the I-VSI via an I-PW (e.g. via MPLS access), 
   the I-PW Service Label is used this time to determine the FIB to 
   which the packet belongs. The PSN and I-PW headers are removed by the 
   ingress PW function and the packet is handled to the I-VSI. Next the 
   destination CMAC address of the packet is then mapped against the I-
   VSI FIB to determine the Next Hop (NH) with the following possible 
   results:  

     -NH = I-ETH/I-Q: the packet is sent out on the corresponding I-ETH 
       AC. Regular AC processing rules apply - e.g. an S-VID and/or C-
       VID tag may be added to the packet. There is no need to add PBB 
       encapsulation to the packet. 

     -NH = another I-PW: ingress PW Encapsulation is removed and egress 
       PW encapsulation is added. The packet is sent out on the I-PW 
       (Split Horizon rules apply). 

     -NH = local B-VSI (over the PIP "port"): the PBB header (BMACs and 
       the corresponding I-TAG) is added and the packet is passed to 
       the B-VSI module for further processing. This is the case when 
       the destination CMAC is located behind a remote PBB PE 
       identified by a destination BMAC. 

     -NH = unknown or the destination CMAC is a Group MAC (Multicast or 
       Broadcast): the packet is flooded to all the virtual ports that 
       are part of the I-VSI, including the local B-VSI context. 

  For the packets that arrive at the B-VSI module from an I-VSI, the 
  ISID is used to determine the specific B-VSI FIB to be used to which 
  the packet belongs. Translation of the PBB header (e.g. ISID) may be 
  performed. Next the destination BMAC is used to determine the Next Hop 
  for the packet with the following possible results: 

     - NH = B-ETH: the PBB Frame is sent out on the B-ETH. Regular AC 
       processing rules apply - e.g. a B-VID is added to the packet. 

     - NH = B-PW: the PBB frame is encapsulated in the PW header before 
       being sent out on the B-PW. The resulted PBB/PW encapsulation is 
       depicted in Figure 5 next to the B-VSI. 

   It is important to highlight in this context that the core PEs (N-PE3 
   and N-PE4 in Figure 3) do not have to be aware about the PBB 
   encapsulation. Just the regular Backbone Ethernet header (i.e. BMAC 
   DA) is used to forward the Ethernet frames. Existing VPLS and PWE3 
   procedures, including Multi-Segment PWs (MS-PW) apply for the PW 
   infrastructure between them. Regular Ethernet PW types (Ethernet and 
   Ethernet VLAN) may be also used to signal the B-PWs (Backbone PWs)

   interconnecting the B-VSIs in the U-PEs and N-PEs or the I-VSIs in 
   the U-PE with other I-VSIs.  

5. Control Plane 

   PBB introduces a hierarchy where a Customer (CMAC) domain is 
   separated from the Service Provider (BMAC) domain from both data 
   plane (e.g. CMAC versus respectively BMAC switching) and control 
   plane (e.g. xSTP, 802.1ak MRP) perspective. For example a CMAC should 
   never be learned in the Backbone context/FIB. 

   When porting the PBB hierarchy in PBB VPLS, the strict separation 
   between the two domains must be maintained in both the VPLS data and 
   control plane. In VPLS the control plane controls the setup of the 
   data plane so it is possible to achieve this separation by proper 
   separation of addressing and control plane procedures. Specifically 
   in the example from Figure 1 the I-VPLS control plane must stay 
   separate from the related B-VPLS control plane. This will ensure that 
   control plane procedures (e.g. VPLS MAC Flush, OAM) destined for one 
   domain will not leak into the other domain. Also PWs in one domain 
   will not try to connect to the other domain: e.g. I-PW, destined for 
   an I-VPLS will not try to connect to a B-VPLS instance. 

   The simplest way to achieve this kind of separation is to assign for 
   I-VPLS and B-VPLS separate addressing schemes. The following sections 
   describe how this applies for BGP auto-discovery or for T-LDP 
   signaling. Optionally usage of NSP capabilities sub-TLV [GE-PW] can 
   guarantee additional protection against operational mistakes. 

5.1. Auto-Discovery 

   When BGP Auto-discovery is used address separation can be achieved by 
   assigning for each I-VPLS and B-VPLS domains a separate set of 
   identifiers and attributes: i.e. VPLS-Id, VSI-Id (RD, Prefix), RT(s) 
   as described in [L2VPN-Sig]). Separate addressing schemes will be 
   automatically generated for LDP signaling as per [L2VPN-Sig].  

5.2. Signaling 

   When BGP-Auto-discovery is not used separate L2 FEC addressing 
   structures [L2VPN-Sig] must be configured to identify each B-VPLS 
   and/or I-VPLS domain accordingly.The setup of the PWs between B-VSIs 
   (B-PWs) and/or between the I-VSIs (I-PWs) may be achieved using the 
   existing PWE3 procedures - see [RFC4762]. This allows porting the 
   existing control plane procedures (PW setup, VPLS MAC Flush,OAM) for 
   each the two domains.

5.2.1. MAC Address Withdraw 

   The use of Address Withdraw message with MAC List TLV is proposed in 
   [RFC4762] as a way to expedite removal of MAC addresses as the result 
   of a topology change (e.g. failure of a primary link of a VPLS PE and 
   implicitly the activation of an alternate link in a dual-homing use 
   case). These existing procedures apply to B-VPLS and I-VPLS domains.  

   When it comes to reflecting topology changes in access networks 
   connected to I-VSI across the B-VPLS domain certain additions should 
   be considered as described below.  

   MAC Switching in PBB is based on the mapping of Customer MACs (CMACs) 
   to Backbone MAC(s) (BMACs). A topology change in the access (I-
   domain) should just invoke the flushing of CMAC entries in PBB PEs' 
   FIB(s) associated with the I-VPLS(s) impacted by the failure. There 
   is a need to indicate the PBB PE (BMAC source) that originated the 
   MAC Flush message.  

   These goals can be achieved by adding a PBB TLV in the Address 
   Withdraw message to indicate the particular domain(s) requiring MAC 
   flush. At the other end, the receiving PBB PEs may use the 
   information from the PBB TLV to flush only the related FIB 
   entry/entries in the I-VSI(s). 

   A suggested PBB TLV structure is depicted below: 

    0                   1                   2                   3

   The UF bits are set to forward unknown so that the intermediate VPLS 
   PEs that are unaware of PBB can just forward the TLV towards the PBB 
   aware IB-PEs. The PBB TLV type values are to be assigned by IANA. The 
   Length field is used to define the length of the PBB TLV including 
   the type and the length itself. Processing of the sub-TLVs should 
   continue when unknown ones are encountered, and they MUST be silently 
   ignored. 

   The following sub-TLVs MUST be included in the PBB TLV: 

   - PBB BMAC List sub-TLV:  

      Type: 0x0001 
      Length: value length in octets. At least one BMAC address must be 
      present in the list.  .  
      Value: one or a list of 48 bits (B-)MAC address(es). These are the 
      source BMAC addresses associated with the B-VSI(s) that originated 
      the MAC Withdraw message. The CMAC(s) mapped to the BMACs listed 
      in the sub-TLV should not be flushed ("Flush all but the CMACs 
      associated with the BMAC(s) in the list"). 
       

   - PBB ISID List sub-TLV:  

      Type: 0x0002 
      Length: value length in octets. Zero indicates an empty ISID list. 
      An empty ISID list means that the flush applies to all the ISIDs 
      mapped to the B-VPLS indicated by the FEC TLV. 
      Value: one or a list of 24 bits ISIDs that represent the I-VSI 
      FIB(s) where the MAC Flush needs to take place. 

   The following steps describe the details of the processing for the 
   related LDP Address Withdraw message: 

   . The LDP MAC Withdraw Message, including the PBB TLV is initiated 
     by the PBB PE(s) experiencing a Topology Change event. 

   . On reception of the LDP message, the B-VSI instances related to 
     the FEC TLV from the LDP Address Withdraw message must interpret 
     the presence of the PBB TLV as an indication of a PBB Flush 
     message. As a result they should not flush their BMAC FIBs. 

   . Next the B-VPLS control plane must propagate the MAC Flush 
     indication following the split-horizon grouping and the 
     established B-PW topology.

Internet-Draft         VPLS Extensions for PBB                July 2008 
    

   . The receiving IB-PE uses the PBB ISID List from the PBB TLV to 
     determine the particular ISID FIBs that need to be flushed. If the 
     ISID List is empty all the ISID FIBs associated with the receiving 
     B-VSI are flushed. The PBB BMAC List from the PBB TLV is used to 
     flush from the ISID FIBs just the entries that map CMACs to the 
     BMACs that are not listed in the sub-TLV. 

5.2.2. NSP Capabilities code points for PBB-VPLS 

   The optional NSP capabilities sub-TLV described in [GE-PW] may be 
   used to provide additional protection against operational mistakes or 
   to detect the type of capabilities supported by the remote NSP. 

   The following NSP capabilities code points are required for PBB-VPLS: 

     -003 B-VSI 

     -004 I-VSI 

     -005 PBB MAC Flush 

   The above code points are included in the NSP capabilities sub-TLV to 
   indicate the supported features and to ensure the right type of NSPs 
   or NSP features are connected via Ethernet PW following the 
   procedures described in [GE-PW]. 

    

6. PBB-VPLS Interworking with regular VPLS Instances 

   The PBB VPLS model described in this document may interoperate with 
   regular VPLS PEs on the I-VSI and/or B-VSI side(s) as long as no PBB 
   functions or optimizations are required on these PEs.

                 Figure 5 Interworking to regular VPLS  

   Some of the interworking scenarios are depicted in Figure 4 where:  

   . N-PE3 is running a regular VPLS VSI marked with V which operates 
      only on the Backbone MAC header, switching performed by the PBB 
      BCBs. No PBB awareness (e.g. I-component functions) is required 
      on this PE which connects to the B-VSIs in U-PE1, U-PE2 and N-
      PE4. In both cases a HVPLS spoke or a VPLS Mesh may be used.  

   . PE6 is running a regular VPLS VSI marked with V' which operates 
      only on the Customer MAC header. No PBB awareness (B-component

      functions, linkage) is required on PE5 which connects to the I-
      VSI on U-PE5 via an HVPLS spoke PW or a VPLS mesh. 

    

7. Multicast Handling 

   PBB MAC hiding may create difficulties for identifying customer 
   Multicast exchanges in the B-VSIs. It is important to be able to 
   support both regular and PBB VPLSes. That way the customer VPNs 
   requiring large volume of Multicast may be addressed using regular 
   VPLS, allowing for easy multicast snooping throughout the VPLS 
   infrastructure. 

   Alternatively, the IEEE 802.1ak MMRP protocol defined in 
   [IEEE802.1ak] may be used to allow for efficient Multicast handling 
   in the B-VPLS infrastructure: i.e. Group BMAC addresses may be 
   assigned per Customer Multicast tree to ensure efficient Multicast 
   distribution.  

8. Resiliency 

   [IEEE802.1ah] recommends the use of Provider MSTP (P-MSTP) to ensure 
   loop free topology for connectionless forwarding throughout PBBN.  

   Using B-VPLS infrastructure instead of native Ethernet core 
   eliminates the need for backbone P-MSTP through the use of a full 
   mesh of PWs with split-horizon and/or via the H-VPLS scheme 
   (Primary/Standby PWs) - see [RFC4762]. 

   On the access side, for a PB network or a CE device dually connected 
   to PBB PEs, a loop spanning both I and B domains may occur. An STP-
   based or a local mechanism may be used to break this loop.  

   A solution that does not imply running MSTP end-to-end should involve 
   the MAC Withdraw scheme described in the signaling section to speed-
   up data plane convergence upon topology changes. 

9. OAM  

   Existing VPLS OAM tools may be used in each I-VPLS and B-VPLS domain. 
   Details of the correlation between these two domains are out of scope 
   of this draft. 

10. Security Considerations 

   This section will be added in a future version.
