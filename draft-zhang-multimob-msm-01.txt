    Abstract 

       Proxy Mobile IPv6, specified in RFC 5213, is a network-based mobility 
       protocol. It uses a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and a Local Mobility 
       Anchor (LMA) to allow hosts to move around within a domain while 
       keeping their address or address prefix stable [1]. Although the 
       issues of mobile multicast in the PMIPv6 network are being discussed 
       in the Multimob WG, how to provide the service connectivity for the 
       mobile multicast source is still a problem for the PMIPv6. This 
       document discusses the extensions of the PMIPv6 to support the 
       multicast source mobility.

    1. Introduction 

       Different from MIPv6 [2], PMIPv6 [1] was proposed to support the 
       network-based mobility management. The entities in the PMIPv6 have 
       the responsibility to track the MN, update the location of the MN and 
       redirect the packets to and from the MN. However, the basic PMIPv6 
       protocol only solves the mobility management for the MN which is 
       involved in the unicast communication. In order to deploy the 
       multicast service in the PMIPv6 network, many schemes have been 
     
     
    Zhang et al.              Expires May,2011                    [Page 2]

       proposed [3-6]. However, all of these schemes aim to support the 
       multicast service for the mobile receiver and how to support the 
       multicast source mobility in the PMIPv6 network is not yet discussed. 
       Without doubt, the multicast source mobility is also a very important 
       issue for the deployment of the multicast service. For example, there 
       is an advanced concept based on the Intelligent Transport Systems 
       (ITS) service. In this concept, all the vehicles on the same route 
       are identified by using a GPS or a car-navigation system. The 
       vehicles multicast real-time video information about the 
       transportation through the communication infrastructure like 3G, WiFi 
       to the other vehicles interested in it. We call this advance 
       information 'Future vision' and the similar concept has been proposed 
       in [7]. The multicast source mobility just provides a network 
       distribution functionality (protocol) to realize the above concept. 

       In this document, a multicast source mobility supporting scheme is 
       proposed. In this scheme, the basic PMIPv6 signalings are extended 
       and the LMA which acts as the RP (Rendezvous Point), responses to the 
       join message sent to the source (e.g., MN). The multicast packets are 
       sent from MN to the LMA as the basic PMIPv6 specified. Then these  
       packets are transmitted through the multicast tree established 
       between the LMA and the receivers using the traditional multicast 
       routing protocols.  

    2. Overview  

       The problem of multicast source mobility was also concerned in the 
       MIPv6 network in which the RPT-based (Rendezvous Point Tree-based) 
       scheme and the SPT-based (Shortest Path Tree-based) scheme are 
       proposed as two solutions [8]. In the RPT-based scheme, the Home 
       Agent (HA) acts as the RP in order to provide the transparency of 
       source mobility. The multicast tree is stable, while the multicast 
       path may not be optimized in this scheme. In the SPT-based scheme, 
       the MN need reconstruct the multicast tree once the L3 (network layer) 
       handover happens. The multicast path can be optimized in this case, 
       however, the frequent handover of the source may lead to the 
       unstability of the multicast tree.  

       The above two schemes can also be used in the PMIPv6 network. For the 
       SPT-based scheme, the SPT can be reconstructed once the MN moves to 
       the new MAG. And for the RPT-based scheme, the LMA can act as the RP 
       for the MN.  However, the SPT-based scheme is not suitable in the 
       PMIPv6 network due to the following reasons: 

       ---The PMIPv6 is used to enhance the handover performance for the MN, 
       which moves in the restricted domain. So the LMA and the MAG may not 
       be so far. In other words, the differences between the two paths 
     
     
    Zhang et al.              Expires May,2011                    [Page 3] 
        
    Internet-Draft      MSM Support in PMIPv6 Network        November 2010 
     

       corresponding to the RPT-based scheme and the SPT-based scheme may 
       not be so evident; 

       ---The stability of the multicast tree is a very important factor for 
       the multicast service, which affects the disruption latency and then 
       the performance of the multicast service during the multicast source 
       mobility. However, in the SPT-based scheme, the multicast tree needs 
       to be reconstructed even the MN moves between two nearby MAGs, which 
       leads to the frequent disruption and low efficiency of the multicast 
       service; 

       ---A mobile multicast source must provide address transparency at two 
       layers: To comply with Reverse Path Forward (RPF) checks, it has to 
       use an address within the source field of the IPv6 basic header, 
       which is in topological agreement with the employed multicast 
       distribution tree. For application transparency, the logical node 
       identifier must be presented as the packet source address to the 
       transport layer at the receiver side. It is a tough problem for the  
       SPT-based scheme because the identifier and the locator of the MN are 
       separated. The MN can only configure the HoA (Home Address) as its 
       identifier and its locator is the address of the MAG. However, the 
       RPT-based scheme can easily solve this problem because the HoA is 
       just anchored at the LMA. 

       Thus, we suggest using the RPT-based scheme to provide the multicast 
       source mobility in the PMIPv6 network. According to the basic PMIPv6 
       specification, all the packets to and from the MN must be transmitted 
       to the LMA through the LMA-MAG tunnel firstly, that means the LMA is 
       a fixed point on the way to and from the MN. So we can set the LMA to 
       be the RP and the proxy source of the multicast. The multicast 
       packets sent by the MN are firstly sent to the LMA as traditional 
       PMIPv6 specified and then the packets are transmitted from the LMA to 
       the receivers according to the multicast routing protocols.  

    3. Extensions of PMIPv6 

       In order to support the mobility of the multicast source, the LMA is 
       selected to be the RP of the mobile multicast service. Besides, the 
       join message is processed by the LMA. Then the signaling messages and 
       the related processing of basic PMIPv6 should be extended.  

    3.1. MN 

       In order to provide the multicast service during the MN's movement, 
       the MAG must recognize that the attached MN is a multicast source.  
       This information can be learned by the MAG during the authentication 
       phase for example and the corresponding multicast address must be 
     
     
    Zhang et al.              Expires May,2011                    [Page 4] 
        
    Internet-Draft      MSM Support in PMIPv6 Network        November 2010 
     

       contained in this information at least. The particular procedure is 
       out of this document. 

    3.2. MAG 

       When the MAG finds that the attached MN is a multicast source, it 
       should send the extended Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message to the 
       LMA. In the extended PBU message, a one bit "S" flag is added and set 
       to "1". The multicast address is contained in the Multicast address 
       option of the PBU message when the "S" is set to "1". Then the MAG 
       encapsulates the multicast packets into the bi-directional tunnel and 
       sends them to the LMA firstly.  

    3.3. LMA 

       When receiving the extended PBU message, the normal PMIPv6 tunnel is 
       established between LMA and MAG. Besides, the LMA recognizes that it 
       should act as the RP for the multicast session specified by the 
       Multicast address option.  

       The LMA also intercepts the join message and proceeds it for the MN. 
       Then the SPT between LMA and the new receiver can be established. In 
       this way, the multicast service can always be provided through the 
       RPT and the stability of the multicast tree is guaranteed.

       The detailed descriptions are as follows: 

       1) The MN connects to the MAG1 initially and sends Router 
          Solicitation (RS) message to the MAG1; 

       2) When the attachment of MN is detected by the MAG1, an extended 
          PBU message is sent to the LMA. Because the LMA finds the S flag 
          and the Multicast address option contained in the PBU message, 
          the LMA acts as the RP of the multicast service corresponding to 
          the Multicast address and responses to the join message sent to 
          the MN. And then the LMA sends back a PBA message to the MAG1. 
          Afterwards, the bi-directional tunnel is established between the 
          MAG1 and the LMA; 

       3) The multicast packets are sent from the MN to the LMA as the 
          basic PMIPv6 specified. Since the multicast routing tree will be 
          established between the LMA and the receiver, the packets are 
          transmitted between the LMA and the receiver according to the 
          multicast routing protocol; 

       4) When the MN moves to the MAG2, the multicast related information 
          is also learned by the MAG2; 

       5) Then the LMA-MAG bi-directional tunnel is refreshed, however, the 
          multicast routing tree between the LMA and the receiver is kept 
          unchanged;

       6) The multicast packets transmission continues after the handover 
          and the mobility of the source is transparent to the receiver.

       S flag and Multicast address option   

          1-bit "Multicast source identification" flag is used to identify 
          whether this MN is a multicast source. When this flag is set to 
          "1", the related multicast address is attached in the Multicast 
          address option.

       S flag and Multicast address option

          The S flag is set to "1" if the LMA can act as the RP for the    
          multicast service identified by the Multicast address option. The 
          LMA will not act as the RP for the multicast service if the S 
          flag is set to "0" or there is no S flag in the PBA message. How 
          to provide the multicast source mobility service in the scenario 
          with the LMA not acting as the RP will be discussed in the future.
