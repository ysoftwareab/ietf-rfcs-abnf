Internet-Draft               CxTP for PANA                 February 2005

Abstract

   The PANA protocol offers a way to authenticate clients in IP based
   access networks.  However, in roaming environments IP clients might
   change of gateways and new EAP authentication from scratch may occur.
   To enhance IP handover in mobile environments, the Context Transfer
   Protocol (CxTP) could be used.  This protocol could recover from
   previous PANA Authentication Agent the PANA security context
   previously established.  The aim of this document is to analyze and
   to describe the different approaches to perfom the transfer.

1.  Introduction

   In IP based access network, PANA [I-D.ietf-pana-pana] may be used as
   a front-end to a AAA architecture in order to authenticate users
   before granting them access to the resources.  For this purpose, it
   uses EAP which offers a variety of authentication methods.  In a
   shared medium this is typically accomplished with the help of
   cryptographic mechanisms.  Note that this type of cryptographic
   mechanism prevents a malicious node from sending packet to the
   network and thereby authenticating each data packet.  In addition,
   encryption is often enabled to prevent eavesdropping.

   While roaming, the PANA client might change its access router.
   Without extensions to PANA the PaC has to restart a new PANA protocol
   exchange to authenticate itself to the network.  In some cases it is
   necessary to execute the EAP exchange from scratch whereas in other
   cases it might be possible to benefit from state stored at the
   visited networks AAA server.  This procedure is known as fast resume.

   In this document, we analyse the interaction between the framework
   defined in [I-D.ietf-seamoby-ctp] and PANA.  In particular, we define
   what should be transferred (i.e.  the PANA context) and the
   interactions with the AAA infrastructure.

   We can envision two different approaches: in the first one, the
   transfer occurs between authentication agents whereas, in the second
   one, we perform the transfer between access routers.  In the latter,
   we need a protocol or an API for the AR-PAA communications.

   For the first approach, three possible solutions are explained.  The
   first one is the solution given in the PANA specification
   [I-D.ietf-pana-mobopts].  In the second solution, a CxTP friendly is
   proposed while the third solution is an optimized version of the
   previous one.

   For the second approach, the transfer occurs between access routers
   as specified by CxTP.  PANA contexts are stored in PAA, thus ARs will
   need an interface to collect context.  The reactive mode and
   predictive mode are presented.

2.  Terminology

   Most of the terms are defined in the PANA [I-D.ietf-pana-pana] and
   CxTP [I-D.ietf-seamoby-ctp] specifications:

   nAR New Access Router.  The router to which the PaC attaches after
      the handover.

   pAR Previous Access Router.  The router to which the PaC was attached
      before the handover.

   CTAA Context Transfer Activate Acknowledge.

   CTAR Context Transfer Activate Request.

   CTD Context Transfer Data.

   CxTP Context Transfer Protocol.

   EP Enforcement Point.  (PANA term)

   FPT Feature Profile Type (CxTP term).

   PaC PANA Client.  A mobile node (MN) using a PANA protocol
      implementation to authenticate itself to the network.

   PAA PANA Authentication Agent.  The access network (server) side
      entity of the PANA protocol.  A PAA is in charge of interfacing
      with the PaCs for authenticating and authorizing them for the
      network access service.

   nPAA New PANA Authentication Agent.  The PAA in charge of the subnet
      to which the PaC is attached after the handover.

   pPAA Previous PANA Authentication Agent.  The PaC's default PAA prior
      to handover.

3.  Background

3.1  PANA overview

   PANA is a protocol that carries EAP over IP/UDP to authenticate
   users.  The PANA Authentication Agent (PAA) is the endpoint of the
   PANA protocol at the access network.  The PAA itself might not be
   able to authenticate the user by terminating the EAP protocol.
   Instead the PAA might forward the EAP payloads to the backend AAA
   infrastructure.

   The Enforcement Point (EP) is an entity which enforces the result of
   the PANA protocol exchange.  The EP might be co-located with the PAA
   or separated as a stand-alone device.  In the latter case, the SNMPv3
   protocol [I-D.ietf-pana-snmp] is used to communicate between PAA and
   EP.

   A successful EAP authentication exchange results in a PANA security
   association (PANA SA) if the EAP method was able to derive session
   keys.  In this case, all further PANA messages between PaC and PAA
   will be authenticated, replay and integrity protected thanks to the
   MAC AVP.

3.1.1  IPsec based access control

   [I-D.ietf-pana-ipsec] describes how PANA could enable IPsec between
   PaC and the EP.  An IKE pre-shared key is distributed to the EP and
   locally derived from the AAA-Key for the PANA client.  Then, IKE is
   used to setup an ESP tunnel.  Figure 1 describes a possible
   architecture, AR/EP is the default router of the PaC and all its
   traffic is protected by the ESP tunnel.

                               |
                               +------ nAR

                       Figure 2: Example Scenario

   Figure 2 shows an example scenario with a roaming PaC which has been
   previously authenticated.  The PAA must be at one IP hop away from
   PaC; this means that a specific PANA module on a PAA is in charge of
   one IP network.  After a PaC's IP handover, the PaC changes of IP
   subnet and of PAA accordingly.  The new PAA (nPAA) does not share any
   context with the PaC.  The new EP (nEP) will detect the PaC and will
   trigger a new PANA authentication phase from scratch.  A new
   authentication phase involving the AAA infrastructure will then
   occur.  Such a signaling can seriously degrades handover performance
   in term of latency.

   For this reason, we propose to use the Context Transfer Protocol
   (CxTP) to transfer PANA context established with the PaC from pPAA to
   the nPAA.

3.2  CxTP overview

   Context Transfer Protocol (CxTP) [I-D.ietf-seamoby-ctp] enables
   context transfers between access routers (ARs).  The context transfer
   can be either initiated by a request from the mobile node ("mobile
   initiated") or at the initiative of either the new or the previous
   access router ("network initiated").  Furthermore it can be performed
   prior to handover ("predictive mode") or after the handover
   ("reactive mode").

   In reactive mode, the MN sends a CT Activate Request (CTAR) to the
   new AR (nAR).  In this message the MN includes an authorization
   token: this token is calculated based on a secret shared between the
   MN and the previous AR (pAR) and it is used in order to authorize the
   transfer.  This means that the MN and the pAR must share a secret.
   The definition of this secret is out of scope of CxTP.  As soon as

Internet-Draft               CxTP for PANA                 February 2005

   the nAR receives a CTAR message, it generates a CT-Request message
   which includes the authorization token and the context to be
   transferred (i.e.  Feature Profile Types).  This message is received
   by the pAR that verifies the authorization token and sends a Context
   Transfer Data (CTD) message including the context requested.

   In the predictive case, the pAR receives a CTAR message from the MN
   whose feature contexts are to be transferred.  This message provides
   the IP address of the nAR and an authorization token.  The pAR
   predictively transmits to the nAR a Context Transfer Data (CTD) that
   contains feature contexts.  This message contains also parameters for
   the nAR to compute an authorization token in order to verify the MN's
   token.  Regardless the MN sent the CTAR to the pAR, it sends another
   CTAR message to the nAR in order to ascertain that the context
   transfer reliably took place.  Furthermore in this CTAR the MN
   includes the authorization token so that the nAR verifies it.

   CxTP messages use Feature Profile Types (FPTs) to identify the way
   data is organized for a particular feature context.  The FPTs are
   registered in a number space that allows a node to unambiguously
   determine the type of context and the context parameters present in
   the protocol messages.

4.  General considerations in the use of CxTP for PANA

   A PaC connected to an access network shares a context with its access
   router like e.g.  compression type, Quality of service parameters and
   security state.  As motivated in the previous sections, the goal of
   this document is to reduce the overhead of establishing state between
   the PaC and the nPAA.  CxTP [I-D.ietf-seamoby-ctp] permits to avoid
   signaling overhead during roaming by enabling authorized context
   transfer between access routers.

   However, CxTP only offers a framework and does not define a
   particular context.  In particular, it appears that PANA is likely to
   use this protocol to enhance mobility handling.

   The aim of this section is to give general considerations on the use
   of CxTP for PANA.

4.1  Conditions to Perform the Transfer

   In this section, we list conditions and recommandations to perform a
   PANA context transfer between two PAAs.  This list is mostly
   inherited from [I-D.aboba-802-context]:

   o  Homogeneous PAA's device deployment within a single administrative
      domain.

   o  Entities engaged in the context transfer should authenticate each
      other.  For this purpose, CxTP indicates that IPsec ESP must be
      used in order to provide connectionless integrity, data origin
      authentication and confidentiality protection.

   o  The nPAA should not obtain keys used to encrypt traffic between
      PaC and pEP.  This traffic may be encrypted at layer 2 or at layer
      3.

4.2  Context Identification

   The context is, a priori, stored in the PAA and the CTP module needs
   a way to collect it.  For this, the current CxTP specification
   proposes to use the IP address.

   In the reactive mode, the MN sends a CTAR message to the nAR
   including the previous MN's address.  The problem is that this
   address can be allocated after the MN's handover to someone else.

   To avoid conflict, the pAR should defend an address allocated to a
   PaC until its context transfer has occured.

Internet-Draft               CxTP for PANA                 February 2005

4.3  Transfer of AAA-Key

   According to EAP [I-D.ietf-eap-keying], the figure below illustrates
   the keys hierarchy in the PANA case:

         PaC                 pPAA                AAA/EAP
         ---                 ----                -------
         MSK                 MSK                 MSK
         EMSK                                    EMSK
         AAA-Key             AAA-Key <---------- AAA-Key

         PANA_MAC_Key        PANA_MAC_Key

   MSK and EMSK are derived from the EAP method used between the PaC and
   the AAA/EAP server.  Those keys must not be exported from the EAP
   module.  The AAA-Key is computed from MSK and EMSK.  This key is
   exported to the pPAA.  The PANA_MAC_KEY, used to protect PANA
   messages, is derived from the AAA-Key as follows:

   PANA_MAC_KEY = The first N bits of
                     HMAC_SHA1(AAA-Key, PaC_nonce | PAA_nonce | Session-ID)

   For security reasons, after the IP handover, the PaC and nPAA should
   derive a new PANA_MAC_Key cryptographically separated from the
   previous one.  This can be accomplished by deriving a new AAA-Key
   cryptographically separated from the previous AAA-Key.

   An obvious solution to have a new PANA_MAC_Key cryptographically
   separated from the old one should be to obtain a new one from the
   AAA/EAP server.

   We propose to use the same solutions as proposed in
   [I-D.ietf-pana-mobopts].  For this, the pPAA provides to nPAA an
   intermediate AAA-Key:

        AAA-Key-int = The first N bits of
            HMAC-SHA1(AAA-Key, DiameterIdentity | Session-ID)

   DiameterIdentity is the identifier of the pPAA and Session-ID is the
   identifier of the Session between the pPAA and PaC.

   If there are two AAA-Keys generated by a NAP/ISP authentication.
   pPAA provides the following key:

        AAA-Key-int = The first N bits of
            HMAC-SHA1(AAA-Key1 | AAA-Key2, DiameterIdentity |

Internet-Draft               CxTP for PANA                 February 2005

            Session-ID)

   During the PSR/PSA exchange, PaC and nPAA provide nonces that are
   used to derive a new AAA-Key:

        AAA-Key-new = The first N bits of
                    HMAC-SHA1(AAA-Key-int, PaC_nonce | PAA_nonce)

   The new PANA_MAC_Key used to compute AVP MAC will be calculated from
   this key.

4.4  Interaction with the AAA infrastructure

   PAAs may use AAA infrastructure to authenticate PaC.  This means that
   the PAA contacts a (local) AAA server and relay the EAP messages in
   order to authenticate a PaC.  The PANA protocol introduces a separate
   authentication for Network Access Provider (NAP) and Internet Service
   Provider (ISP), please read [I-D.ietf-pana-pana] for more
   information.  For simplicity, we will assume in the rest of this
   document that NAP will not perform AAA operations.

   We have two possible situations depending on roaming situation.  We
   only consider use of RADIUS [RFC2865] or Diameter EAP application
   [I-D.ietf-aaa-eap].

   contacts its local AAA server.

                   Figure 5: PaC in a visited domain

   In Figure 5, the PaC is in a visited domain.  It can not be
   authenticated by the local AAA server (AAAL).  In this case, the PAA
   contacts a local AAA entity which will contact the home AAA server.

   In the first situation, the PAA shares a session with only one AAA
   server.  This server keeps information on the authenticated PaC such
   as session-lifetime, PAA's identity, authorized services...In some
   cases, the AAA server may have to contact the PaC (e.g.
   re-authentication) and thus if the PaC changes of PAAs, it seems
   necessary to contact the AAA server to inform it of the new PAA in
   charge of the PaC.

   The second situation is a little bit more complex since the PAA does
   not know the AAAH's identity.  We can however state that it is
   necessary for the PAA to inform its local AAA entity of PaC's new
   location.  Depending on policy, the AAAL server should inform the
   AAAH server.

   To inform the AAA server of PaC's new location, two solutions are

   of contacting the AAA server to inform it of the nPAA.

   In the second one (cf.  Figure 7), the nPAA informs the AAA server.

   It also seems necessary to inform the nPAA of the AAA server's
   identity.

4.5  The PANA Context

   The PANA Context is what should be transferred between the two PAAs
   to avoid re-authentication from scratch.  The attributes described in
   [I-D.ietf-pana-pana] list elements that could constitute the PANA
   context at PAA.  However some of these data are PAA specific and as
   such does not need to be transferred.

   Figure 8 summarizes the PANA Context.

   Data have the following meanings:

   Session-Lifetime: The authentication phase also determines the PANA
      session lifetime when authorization succeeds.  This value is
      included in Session-Lifetime AVP.  In Diameter [RFC3588], this AVP
      (Session-Timeout) is of type Unsigned32 and contains the maximum
      number of seconds of service to be provided to the user before
      session termination.  Note that the value forwarded to the new PAA
      needs to reflect the already 'consumed' session lifetime.  This
      helps to avoid problems where roaming is used to reset the
      lifetime when re-attaching at a new PAA.  It must be assured that
      the sum of the individual session lifetimes is never greater than
      the initially communicated lifetime (type: Unsigned32, length: 4)

5.  First approach: use of CxTP between PAAs

   The transfer may occur either after or before the handover.  From
   this standpoint, we define two operating transfer modes:

   o  Reactive mode: the PaC has already performed the handover.  We
      assume that it has acquired an address.

   o  Predictive mode: the transfer occurs before the handover.

   Different approaches exist to perform PANA context transfer using
   CxTP.  In this document, we describe three of them and we discuss
   interaction between CxTP specification and PANA.

   In each of these 3 solutions, the transfer occurs between PAAs and
   they use a CTD message containing the PANA context.

   The CTD message is described in the following figure (ABNF notation):

         CTD-PANA ::= < CTD-Header>
         < Context Data Block, Ctx-Type: PANA-Context-Transfer, FPT>
            { Session-Lifetime-Elapsed }
         { AAA-Key-int }
         { AAA server's identity }
         { ISP-Identifier }
         { ISP-Name }
         { Double Authentication NAP/ISP information }

                       Figure 9: CTD-PANA message

   where FPT (Feature Profile Type) identifies the way the particular
   feature context is organized.

5.1  PANA solution

   In the solution proposed by PANA [I-D.ietf-pana-mobopts], the PaC
   does not use CTAR message to request and activate the context.
   Instead, it replies to PSR message with a PSA message containing the
   unexpired previous PANA session identifier and a MAC AVP (cf.  Figure
   10).  This AVP is computed using the PANA_MAC_KEY shared between the
   PaC and its pPAA.

          PBA [MAC]
       --------------->

                      Figure 10: The PANA approach

   The nPAA receives this PSA message and it deduces that it must
   perform CxTP (because of the Session-Id AVP).  It determines the
   identity of pPAA by looking at the DiameterIdentity part of the PANA
   session identifier.  It sends a CT-Request to the pPAA containing the
   PSA message.  The pPAA checks the validity of the PSA message and
   transfers the PANA context in the CTD message.  Then the PANA session
   continues with a PANA-Bind exchange.

   This procedure has the following issues:

   o  It does not support predictive mode since we do not have a CTAR
      message.

   o  CxTP does not define a way to carry PSA message in CT-Request.

   o  The CxTP module can not validate the transfer since the CT-Request
      does not provide any authorization token.

5.2  CxTP friendly approach

5.2.1  Operations in reactive mode

   As described in the previous paragraph, in order to handle PaC
   mobility in the reactive case, the approach based on
   [I-D.ietf-pana-mobopts] has some unsolved issues: these issues
   concern the usage of CxTP to perform the context transfer between
   PAAs.  A possible alternative approach is to perform the context
   transfer relying completely on CxTP as specified in


Bournelle (Ed.), et al.    Expires August 19, 2005             [Page 16]

   [I-D.ietf-seamoby-ctp].  Figure 11 shows the message flow if this
   CxTP-friendly approach is used.

      --------------->

      PBR[nSession-Id]
   <-------------
           PBA
    ------------->


         Figure 11: CxTP friendly approach: non predictive mode

   When the PaC performs a change of the point of attachment to the
   network, it receives a trigger indicating that a handoff has occured
   and consequently a context transfer should be performed.  This
   trigger might be a PSR message sent by the nPAA (as depicted in
   Figure 11) or an internal DNA trigger (e.g.  L2 "link-up" trigger).
   Based on this event notification, the PaC begins the CxTP procedure
   sending to the nPAA a CTAR message to trigger the context transfer.
   Based on [I-D.ietf-seamoby-ctp] this message MUST include the
   previous address of the PaC, the address of the pPAA and an
   authorization token needed to authorize the transfer.  This
   authorization token is computed using a key that we called
   PANA_CxTP_KEY.  The nPAA sends a CT-Request to the pPAA including the
   previous address of the PaC and the authorization token.  These data
   are needed to the pPAA in order to identify the PaC and to retrieve


Bournelle (Ed.), et al.    Expires August 19, 2005             [Page 17]
Internet-Draft               CxTP for PANA                 February 2005

   the associated PANA state.  If the authorization token is verified
   successfully, the pPAA sends to the nPAA the PANA context of the PaC
   through a CTD-PANA message.  Finally the nPAA sends a CTAA message to
   the PaC as a confirm that the context transfer has been completed.
   Upon the receipt of the CTAA, the PaC sends to the nPAA a PSA
   message: the protocol operation continues as specified in section
   4.11 of [I-D.ietf-pana-pana].

   Even if it is compliant to CxTP specification, this approach has
   several open issues:

   o  [I-D.ietf-seamoby-ctp] specifies that the context transfer is
      performed between Access Routers, while in this scenario it is
      performed between PAAs;

   o  in CxTP the transfer is authorized through the authorization
      token: it should be defined the key (called PANA_CxTP_KEY in this
      document) needed to calculate this authorization token;

   o  if CxTP operations are triggered by a PSR message (i.e.  it is not
      provided by layer 2 or by a DNA solution), the nPAA keeps on
      sending PSR messages waiting to receive a PSA message; indeed the
      PaC sends the PSA message only once the context transfer is
      accomplished.  This implies an inefficiency in PANA protocol
      operations.

   o  in order to send a CTAR message, the PaC must know the nPAA IP
      address.  This could be an issue if CxTP is triggered by DNA,
      since a DNA solution might not provide the IP address of the nPAA.
      For this reason, the PaC might be forced to perform a new
      discovery phase to get the nPAA's address.

5.2.2  Operations in predictive mode

   To trigger the transfer, PaC/MN sends a CTAR message to pPAA.  In
   this message, it includes data which permit the pPAA to recover the
   nPAA's address.  The nAR's address should be this value.  An
   authorization token is also computed using PANA-CxTP-Key.

   The pPAA sends the CTD message to the nPAA/AR indicated in the CTAR
   message.  In this case, it is a predictive CTD message and thus it
   must also contain:

   o  Algorithm, Key length and PANA-CxTP-Key: allows the nPAA to
      compute a token locally and verify against the token present in
      the CTAR message.



Bournelle (Ed.), et al.    Expires August 19, 2005             [Page 18]
Internet-Draft               CxTP for PANA                 February 2005

   o  The PANA context as described above in Section 4.5

   o  The (previous) IP address of PaC.

   pPAA may set the A flag (see [I-D.ietf-seamoby-ctp]) in order to have
   an acknowledgment of this message.

   The nPAA creates an entry for this PaC.  PaC performs the handover
   and sends CTAR message (after receiving a PSR message).  nPAA
   recovers the context using PaC's address indicated in the CTAR
   message.  It verifies the authorization token and if it is correct it
   activates the context.  Then they perform a PBR/PBA exchange.  Thus
   the nPAA can allocate a new session-id.

   This predictive mode raises the following issue:
   o  After receiving the CTD message from pPAA, the nPAA creates an
      entry for the PaC.  But in which state is it for this PaC ? Do a
      new state is needed ?

5.3  Optimized approach

   In this approach, the CTAR message is embedded in the PSA message.
   Thus, we reduce the number of messages.

5.3.1  Operations in the Reactive mode


   PaC           nPAA              pPAA
   ---              ----              ----
     PSR [PAA_Nonce]
   <---------------
    PSA [CTAR][PaC_Nonce]
    --------------->
                          CT-Request
                        -------------->
                             CTD
                      <--------------
     PBR[nSession-Id]
   <-------------
           PBA
    ------------->

   While entering in the new network, the PaC will be detected and the
   nPAA will send a PSR message.  To trigger the transfer the PaC can
   answer with a PSA message containing a CTAR message in an AVP.  The
   PSA message contain an AVP PaC_Nonce.


Bournelle (Ed.), et al.    Expires August 19, 2005             [Page 19]
Internet-Draft               CxTP for PANA                 February 2005

   This CTAR message should contain the following data:

   o  The previous PaC's address.

   o  The previous PAA's address.

   o  An authorization token computed over this message using a shared
      key between PaC and pPAA (the PANA_CxTP_KEY).

   After receiving the PSA-CTAR message from the PaC, the PANA module
   delivers the CTAR message to the PANA-CxTP module.  The PAA sends a
   CT-Request to request the transfer.  As noted in Section 4.1, this
   message must be protected by ESP [I-D.ietf-ipsec-esp-v3] as specified
   in [I-D.ietf-seamoby-ctp].

   The pPAA verifies the authorization token before sending the CTD
   message.  The CTD message contains:

   o  The Elapsed Time in milliseconds.  This value reflects the already
      'consumed' session lifetime.

   o  The PaC's previous address.

   o  The PANA Context block.

   This message must also be protected by ESP.

   After receiving and processing the CTD message, the nPAA eventually
   change the state of the PaC.  It computes the AAA-Key-new (using
   PaC_Nonce, AAA-Key-int and PAA_Nonce) and derives a new PANA_MAC_Key.
   Then it can send the PANA-Bind-Request containing the newly allocated
   Session-ID.  This message is authenticated by a MAC AVP computed with
   the new PANA_MAC_Key.  After receiving a PANA-Bind-Answer from the
   PaC, it changes its state to OPEN.

   Issues:

   o  New state to handle the period of time where the nPAA is waiting
      the PaC's context from pPAA ?

   o  Generation the PANA-CxTP-Key ?

   o  Piggyback of a CxTP message in PANA.

5.3.2  Operations in the Predictive mode

   The operations here are quite similar than in Section 5.2.2.  The
   difference is that the PaC embeds the CTAR message in the PSA after
   the IP handover.

   This section lists the different issues raised in previous section.

   o  PAAs are not Access Routers.  CxTP states that context transfer
      occurs between ARs.

   o  CT-request does not define a way to carry PSA message.

   o  Which protocol can be used to inform the AAA server of the nPAA in
      charge of the PaC ? A AAA extension ?

   o  Who informs the local AAA entity of the new PAA in charge of the
      PaC ? (pPAA or nPAA ?)

   o  Computation of the PANA-CxTP-Key ?

   o  If Session-Lifetime is near its expiration, is it necessary to
      perform the transfer ?

   o  State machine modification in PaC and PAA ?

6.  Second approach: use of CxTP between ARs

   If CxTP is used between PAAs, two CxTP exchange in parallel in the
   access network may occur: one between ARs (e.g.  for QoS) and one
   between PAAs.  For this reason, we analyze in this section use of
   CxTP between ARs for PANA.

   As specified in PANA [I-D.ietf-pana-pana], PAA may be colocated with
   AR.  In this case, an API for the AR-PAA communication is sufficient.
   If PAA and AR are not colocated, a protocol is needed for our
   purpose.  One of the goal of this work is also to investigate which
   protocol could be used for this.

   In the next two sections, predictive and reactive cases are
   described.

6.1  Predictive case

   In this case, the PaC sends a CTAR message to its AR.  This CTAR
   message indicates that PaC wants its PANA context to be transferred.
   This message is protected with an authorization token computed with a
   key.  CxTP does not define how to obtain this key.  A possible
   approach could be to use the EAP key hierachy but this is not the
   purpose of this document.

                    PANA-Bind-Exchange
    <------------------------------------------------->

   The PaC sends a CTAR message protected by an authorization token.
   The pAR checks this token and if valid, requests the PANA context to
   the pPAA.  The pPAA provides the corresponding context to the pAR.
   This context is identified using PaC's IP address.  The pAR may
   retrieve other contexts.  Then it sends the CTD message to the nAR.
   This nAR is specified in the CTAR message.  The nAR keeps it but wait
   for CTAR message before setting the context.

   After its IP handover, the PANA client sends the CTAR message to the
   new AR.  This message contains a token.  The pAR has provided the nAR
   with the necessary keying material in order to verify this token.
   After the validation, the nAR can set contexts.  For PANA, it sends a
   message containing the context to the nPAA which will create an entry
   for the PaC.  The nPAA should be able to acknowledge this message if
   PaC has requested an acknowledgement.

   After this, the nPAA may start with a PANA-start exchange followed by

   a PANA-Bind-Exchange in order to create a new PANA session-id, new
   PANA keying material and configure nEP.  This implies that:

   o  EPs are configured to allow CxTP traffic (CTAR/CTAA message).

   o  The PaC must not try to discover PAA before receiving CTAA message
      except for the first authentication.

6.2  Reactive case

   In the reactive case, the PANA client has already performed its IP
   handover.

                    PANA-Bind-Exchange
    <------------------------------------------------->

   The PANA client sends a CTAR message to the nAR requesting for the
   PANA context.  This message contains the IP address of the pAR and an
   authorization token.  nAR sends a CT-Request to the pAR containing
   the CTAR message.  After validating the CTAR message, the pAR
   collects requested contexts and forward them to the nAR in the CTD
   message.  The nAR sends the PANA context to the local PAA and
   possibly wait for an acknowledgement.  If requested by the PaC, the
   nAR sends a CTAA message.

   After this, a classic PANA-Start-Exchange occurs but then they
   directly perform a PANA-Bind-exchange.  This exchange permits to
   terminate the configuration of the PANA client: the nPAA allocates a
   new session-id and may allocate an IP adress.

   To avoid conflicts, PANA authentication should not be triggered
   before context transfer has been completed.  For this purpose, the
   following points must be respected:

   o  PANA client should not send a PSR message before receiving the
      CTAA message.

   o  The nEP should not trigger PANA authentication while receiving
      CTAR/CTAA messages.

6.3  Considerations on the AR-PAA communications

   If CxTP is used between ARs, a protocol is needed between AR and PAA.
   This protocol is used in the previous access network by the AR to
   collect the PANA context from the PAA.  The context located at the
   PAA should be identified by the IP address of the PaC.  In the new
   access network, the AR must send the context to the PAA and the
   former must be able to acknowledge this message.

   This is a list of requirements about this protocol:

   o  The AR and the PAA must be able to authenticate each other.

   o  The AR and the PAA must provide integrity protection.

   o  The AR and the PAA must provide confidentiality.

   o  The PANA context should be identified by IP address at the PAA.

7.  Security considerations

   This document deals with interaction between the Seamoby Context
   Transfer Protocol and PANA.  Therefore, all security considerations
   described in [I-D.ietf-seamoby-ctp] and in [I-D.ietf-pana-pana] apply
   also here.

   The approach described in this document considers only the
   intra-domain scenario.  This means that the PAAs involved in the
   context transfer belong to the same administrative domain.
   Therefore, at this stage the inter-domain scenario is out of scope.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-seamoby-ctp] IPsec ESP must be used to
   protect CxTP messages between PAAs.  In order to avoid the
   introduction of additional latency due to the need for establishment
   of a secure channel between the context transfer peers, the two PAAs
   should establish such a secure channel in advance.  The mechanism
   used by the PAAs to establish such a channel is out of the scope of
   this draft: for example, IKE [RFC2409] with pre-shared key
   authentication might be used.

   Furthermore, CxTP requires that the PaC and the PAA possess a shared
   secret to calculate the authorization token: for this purpose, this
   document defines a new key PANA-CxTP-Key probably derived from the
   AAA-Key.  The mechanism used by the nPAA to derive a new AAA-key and
   consequently a new PANA-CxTP-key is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-pana-pana].
