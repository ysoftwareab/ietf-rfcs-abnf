1.  Introduction

   The base Port Control Protocol (PCP, [RFC6887]) specification allows
   to retrieve the external IP address and external port to be conveyed
   in the SIP signaling messages [RFC3261].  Therefore, SIP Proxy
   Servers do not need to support means to ease the NAT traversal of SIP
   messages (e.g., [RFC5626], [RFC6223], etc.).  Another advantage of
   using the external IP address and port is this provides a hint to the
   proxy server there is no need to return a small expire timer (e.g.,
   60s).  In addition, the outbound proxy does not need any further
   feature to be supported in order to assist the remote endpoint to
   successfully establish media sessions.  In particular, ALGs are not
   required in the NAT for this purpose and no dedicated functions at
   the media gateway are needed.

   This document discusses how PCP can be used in SIP deployments
   (including IPv6 considerations).

   The benefits of using PCP for SIP deployments are listed below:

   o  Avoid embedding an ALG in the middleboxes.  Note, ALGs are not
      recommended since the evolution of the service would depend on the
      ALG maintenance.

   o  Not require any Hosted NAT Traversal function (e.g., [RFC7362]) to
      be embedded in the SIP server.  Intermediate NATs and firewalls
      are transparent to the SIP service platform.

   o  Avoid overloading the network with keepalive message to maintain
      the mapping in intermediate middleboxes.

      Note, mechanisms such as STUN do not allow to discover the
      lifetime assigned by the middleboxes; frequent keepalive messages
      are therefore generated to maintain binding entries on those
      middleboxes.  PCP is superior to those mechanisms as it allows to
      retrieve the assigned lifetime, and to provide hints to the
      middleboxes in order to decide which lifetime value is to be
      assigned for that particular flow.

   o  Work without requiring symmetric RTP/RTCP [RFC4961].

   o  Not require symmetric SIP to work (i.e., rport [RFC3581]).

   o  Easily support unidirectional sessions.

   o  Does not encounter issues with early media.

   o  The combination of PCP and ALTC [RFC6947] allows to optimize
      IPv4-IPv6 interworking function resources.

   o  Because there is no need for connectivity checks, session
      establishment delay is not impacted (pairs of ports can be pre-
      reserved).

   o  The binding entries maintained by a flow-aware device (NAT/
      Firewall) can be associated with a textual description
      ([RFC7220]).

   Experimentation results, including SIP flow examples, are documented
   in [I-D.boucadair-pcp-nat64-experiments].

   In deployments where ICE [RFC5245] is required, PCP can be of great
   help as discussed in [I-D.penno-rtcweb-pcp] for the WebRTC case.  ICE
   can be used in the context of SIP over WebSocket [RFC7118] and WebRTC
   when deployed within managed networks.  Because TURN suffers from
   limitations in traversing NAT and firewalls over UDP, PCP is a
   promising solution that can complement ICE in those deployment
   contexts to soften the experienced high failure rate [ICEFailure].

   The document targets SIP deployments in managed networks.  It can
   also be used as part of SIP-based services delivery in the context of

   The PCP server can be provisioned using a variety of means (e.g.,
   [RFC7291]) or rely on the discovery method specified in [RFC6887].

   This document does not make any assumption whether the PCP client is
   implemented as an OS service or whether it is integrated in the SIP
   User Agent (UA).  Those considerations are implementation-service.

2.  PCP Features

2.1.  Learn External IP Address and Port Number

   The PCP base specification allows to create mappings in PCP-
   controlled devices and therefore prepare for receiving incoming

   packets.  A SIP UA can use PCP to create one mapping for SIP
   signalling messages and other mappings for media session purposes.

   The SIP UA uses the external IP address and port number to build SIP
   headers.  In particular, this information is used to build the VIA
   and CONTACT headers.

   Figure 2 shows an example of the flow exchange that occurs to
   retrieve the external IP address and an external IP address assigned
   by the NAT, while Figure 2 provides an excerpt of the SIP REGISTER
   message issued by the SIP UA; only the assigned IP address and port
   number are present in the SIP headers.

   The external IP address and port(s) instantiated for media streams,
   are used to build the SDP offer/answer.  In particular, the "c" line
   and "m" lines.

2.2.  Learn and Set the Lifetime of Mapping Entries

   PCP allows to discover and to set the lifetime of mapping
   instantiated in intermediate middleboxes.

   The discovery of the lifetime of a mapping avoids overloading the
   network and SIP servers with frequent messages.  This is in
   particular important for cellular devices.  According to [Power], the
   consumption of a cellular device with a keep-alive interval equal to
   20 seconds (that is the default value in [RFC3948] for example) is 29
   mA (2G)/34 mA (3G).  This consumption is reduced to 16 mA (2G)/24 mA
   (3G) when the interval is increased to 40 seconds, to 9.1 mA (2G)/16
   mA (3G) if the interval is equal to 150 seconds, and to 7.3 mA
   (2G)/14 mA (3G) if the interval is equal to 180 seconds.  When no
   keep-alive is issued, the consumption would be 5.2 mA (2G)/6.1 mA
   (3G).  The impact of keepalive messages would be more severe if
   multiple applications are issuing those messages (e.g., SIP, IPsec,
   etc.).

2.3.  Allow Unidirectional Media Flows

   As a consequence of instantiating mappings for media/session flows,
   incoming packets can be successfully forwarded to the appropriate SIP
   UA.  Particularly, unidirectional media flows (e.g., announcement
   server) will be forwarded accordingly.

2.4.  Preserve Port Parity

   For deployments relying on classic RTP/RTCP odd/even port numbers
   assignment scheme, PORT_SET option [I-D.ietf-pcp-port-set] can be
   used by a SIP UA to request port parity be preserved by the PCP
   server.

   An example is depicted in Figure 4.

2.5.  Preserve Port Contiguity

   For deployments assuming RTCP port number can be deduced from the RTP
   port number, PORT_SET option [I-D.ietf-pcp-port-set] can be used by a
   SIP UA to retrieve a pair of contiguous ports from the PCP server.

   A flow example is shown in Figure 4.

2.6.  Learn PREFIX64

   If the SIP UA is located behind a NAT64 device [RFC6146], the option
   defined in [RFC7225] can be used to retrieve the PREFIX64 used by
   that NAT64 device.

   The retrieved prefix will be used to locally build an IPv6-converted
   IPv4 address ([RFC6052]) corresponding to the IPv4 address included
   in the SDP message received from a remote IPv4-enabled SIP UA; the
   SDP message can be an SDP offer or an answer.

          Figure 5: Example of IPv6 to IPv4 SIP-Initiated Session

   Figure 6 shows the content of the SIP INVITE message sent by the
   IPv6-only SIP UA.  This message uses the retrieved external IP
   address and external port numbers in SIP headers and SDP lines.  This
   message is translated by the NAT64 without altering the SIP/SDP
   content.

2.7.  Compliant with "a=rtcp" Attribute

   The base PCP specification can be used to retrieve the port number to
   be singled if "a=rtcp" attribute is in use [RFC3550].

2.8.  DSCP Marking Policy

   PCP can be used to discover the DSCP value to be used when sending
   real-time flows or to create a mapping that matches a DSCP marking.
   This can be achieved using the DSCP option defined in
   [I-D.boucadair-pcp-extensions].  DSCP setting value is configured by
   the network and not the SIP UA.

   This feature can be used as an input for DSCP marking in some
   deployments such as [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos].

3.  Avoid Crossing CGNs

3.1.  Avoid NAT64

   Because an IPv6-only SIP UA is not aware of the connectivity
   capabilities of the remote UA, the IPv6-only SIP UA uses the ALTC
   attribute [RFC6947] to signal the assigned IPv6 address and the IPv4
   address learned via PCP.

   If the remote SIP UA is IPv6-enabled, IPv6 transfer capabilities will
   be used to place the session.  If the remote SIP UA is IPv4-only,
   IPv4 transfer capabilities will be used.  NAT64 devices will be
   crossed only if the remote UA is IPv4-only.

   Figure 7 provides an except of a SIP INVITE message that encloses
   both the local IPv6 address and the IPv4 address/port number assigned
   by a NAT64 device.

3.2.  Avoid Crossing DS-Lite AFTR

   SIP UAs co-located with the B4 [RFC6333] or located behind the CPE
   can behave as dual-stack UAs:

   o  Native IPv6 address is assigned locally.

   o  The external IPv4 address and port is retrieved using PCP.

   To avoid unnecessary invocation of AFTR resources, ALTC attribute is
   used to signal both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  If the remote SIP UA is
   IPv6-enabled, IPv6 transfer capabilities will be used to place the
   session (i.e., the flows will avoid crossing the DS-Lite AFTR
   device).  If the remote SIP UA is IPv4-only, IPv4 transfer
   capabilities will be used.  AFTR devices will be crossed only if the
   remote UA is IPv4-only.

4.  Security Considerations

   PCP-related security considerations are discussed in [RFC6887].

   Security considerations related to the discovery of PREFIX64 are
   discussed in Section 7 of [RFC7225] and those related to retrieving a
   set of ports are discussed in Section 7 of [I-D.ietf-pcp-port-set].

   An attacker that wants to intercept media flows, without requiring
   intercepting SIP signalling message, can insert a fake PCP server
   that will influence the content of SIP messages so that an
   illegitimate node is inserted in the media path.  Such behavior is
   not desirable.  Means to prevent the PCP client from discovering
   illegitimate PCP servers must be enforced.  Within the context of
   this document, the network on which the PCP messages are to be sent
   is fully trusted.  For example, access control lists (ACLs) can be
   installed on the PCP client, PCP server, and the network between
   them, so those ACLs allow only communications from a trusted PCP
   client to the PCP server.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action from IANA.
