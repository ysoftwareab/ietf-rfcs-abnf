  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The Internet was, from very early in its lifetime, considered a possible vehicle for the deployment of real-time, interactive applications - with the most easily imaginable being audio conversations (aka "Internet telephony") and videoconferencing.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">The first attempts to build this were dependent on special networks, special hardware and custom-built software, often at very high prices or at low quality, placing great demands on the infrastructure.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">As the available bandwidth has increased, and as processors and other hardware has become ever faster, the barriers to participation have decreased, and it is possible to deliver a satisfactory experience on commonly available computing hardware.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">Still, there are a number of barriers to the ability to communicate universally - one of these is that there is, as of yet, no single set of communication protocols that all agree should be made available for communication; another is the sheer lack of universal identification systems (such as is served by telephone numbers or email addresses in other communications systems).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">Development of The Universal Solution has proved hard, however, for all the usual reasons. This memo aims to take a more building-block-oriented approach, and try to find consensus on a set of substrate components that we think will be useful in any real-time communications systems.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">The last few years have also seen a new platform rise for deployment of services: The browser-embedded application, or "Web application". It turns out that as long as the browser platform has the necessary interfaces, it is possible to deliver almost any kind of service on it.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">Traditionally, these interfaces have been delivered by plugins, which had to be downloaded and installed separately from the browser; in the development of HTML5, much promise is seen by the possibility of making those interfaces available in a standardized way within the browser.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.8">This memo specifies a set of building blocks that can be made accessible and controllable through a Javascript API interface in a browser, and which together form a necessary and sufficient set of functions to allow the use of interactive audio and video in applications that communicate directly between browsers across the Internet. The resulting protocol suite is intended to enable all the applications that are described as required scenarios in the RTCWEB use cases document <a href="#I-D.ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements">[I-D.ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.9">Other efforts, for instance the W3C WebRTC, Web Applications and Device API working groups, focus on making standardized APIs and interfaces available, within or alongside the HTML5 effort, for those functions; this memo concentrates on specifying the protocols and subprotocols that are needed to specify the interactions that happen across the network.</p>
<p></p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> Principles and Terminology</h1>
<p></p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.1">2.1.</a> Goals of this document</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.1">The goal of the RTCWEB protocol specification is to specify a set of protocols that, if all are implemented, will allow the implementation to communicate with another implementation using audio, video and auxiliary data sent along the most direct possible path between the participants.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.2">This document is intended to serve as the roadmap to the RTCWEB specifications. It defines terms used by other pieces of specification, lists references to other specifications that don't need further elaboration in the RTCWEB context, and gives pointers to other documents that form part of the RTCWEB suite.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.3">By reading this document and the documents it refers to, it should be possible to have all information needed to implement an RTCWEB compatible implementation.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.2">2.2.</a> Relationship between API and protocol</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.1">The total RTCWEB/WEBRTC effort consists of two pieces:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>A protocol specification, done in the IETF</li>
<li>A Javascript API specification, done in the W3C <a href="#webrtc-api">[webrtc-api]</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, these two specifications aim to provide an environment where Javascript embedded in any page, viewed in any compatible browser, when suitably authorized by its user, is able to set up communication using audio, video and auxiliary data, where the browser environment does not constrain the types of application in which this functionality can be used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.3">The protocol specification does not assume that all implementations implement this API; it is not intended to be possible by observing the bits on the wire whether they come from a browser or from another device implementing this specification.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.4">The goal of cooperation between the protocol specification and the API specification is that for all options and features of the protocol specification, it should be clear which API calls to make to exercise that option or feature; similarly, for any sequence of API calls, it should be clear which protocol options and features will be invoked.  Both subject to constraints of the implementation, of course.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.3">2.3.</a> On interoperability and innovation</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.1">The "Mission statement of the IETF" <a href="#RFC3935">[RFC3935]</a> states that "The benefit of a standard to the Internet is in interoperability - that multiple products implementing a standard are able to work together in order to deliver valuable functions to the Internet's users."</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.2">Communication on the Internet frequently occurs in two phases:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Two parties communicate, through some mechanism, what functionality they both are able to support</li>
<li>They use that shared communicative functionality to communicate, or, failing to find anything in common, give up on communication.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are often many choices that can be made for communicative functionality; the history of the Internet is rife with the proposal, standardization, implementation, and success or failure of many types of options, in all sorts of protocols.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.4">The goal of having a mandatory to implement function set is to prevent negotiation failure, not to preempt or prevent negotiation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.5">The presence of a mandatory to implement function set serves as a strong changer of the marketplace of deployment - in that it gives a guarantee that, as long as you conform to a specification, and the other party is willing to accept communication at the base level of that specification, you can communicate successfully.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.6">The alternative - that of having no mandatory to implement - does not mean that you cannot communicate, it merely means that in order to be part of the communications partnership, you have to implement the standard "and then some" - that "and then some" usually being called a profile of some sort; in the version most antithetical to the Internet ethos, that "and then some" consists of having to use a specific vendor's product only.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.p.5">If the two Web servers are operated by different entities, the signalling path needs to be agreed upon, either by standardization or by other means of agreement; for example, both servers might implement SIP, and the servers would talk SIP to each other, and each would translate between the SIP protocol and their proprietary representation for sending to their application running in the browser. This part is outside the scope of the RTCWEB standars suite.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.6">On this drawing, the critical part to note is that the media path ("low path") goes directly between the browsers, so it has to be conformant to the specifications of the RTCWEB protocol suite; the signalling path ("high path") goes via servers that can modify, translate or massage the signals as needed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.7">The functionality groups that are needed in the browser can be specified, more or less from the bottom up, as:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Data transport: TCP, UDP and the means to securely set up connections between entities, as well as the functions for deciding when to send data: Congestion management, bandwidth estimation and so on.</li>
<li>Data framing: RTP and other data formats that serve as containers, and their functions for data confidentiality and integrity.</li>
<li>Data formats: Codec specifications, format specifications and functionality specifications for the data passed between systems.  Audio and video codecs, as well as formats for data and document sharing, belong in this category. In order to make use of data formats, a way to describe them, a session description, is needed.</li>
<li>Connection management: Setting up connections, agreeing on data formats, changing data formats during the duration of a call; SIP and Jingle/XMPP belong in this category.</li>
<li>Presentation and control: What needs to happen in order to ensure that interactions behave in a non-surprising manner. This can include floor control, screen layout, voice activated image switching and other such functions - where part of the system require the cooperation between parties. Cisco/Tandberg's TIP was one attempt at specifying this functionality.</li>
<li>Local system support functions: These are things that need not be specified uniformly, because each participant may choose to do these in a way of the participant's choosing, without affecting the bits on the wire in a way that others have to be cognizant of. Examples in this category include echo cancellation (some forms of it), local authentication and authorization mechanisms, OS access control and the ability to do local recording of conversations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Within each functionality group, it is important to preserve both freedom to innovate and the ability for global communication.  Freedom to innovate is helped by doing the specification in terms of interfaces, not implementation; any implementation able to communicate according to the interfaces is a valid implementation. Ability to communicate globally is helped both by having core specifications be unencumbered by IPR issues and by having the formats and protocols be fully enough specified to allow for independent implementation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.9">One can think of the three first groups as forming a "media transport infrastructure", and of the three last groups as forming a "media service". In many contexts, it makes sense to use a common specification for the media transport infrastructure, which can be embedded in browsers and accessed using standard interfaces, and "let a thousand flowers bloom" in the "media service" layer; to achieve interoperable services, however, at least the first five of the six groups need to be specified.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> Data transport</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">Data transport refers to the sending and receiving of data over the network interfaces, the choice of network-layer addresses at each end of the communication, and the interaction with any intermediate entities that handle the data, but do not modify it (such as TURN relays).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">The intent of this specification is to allow each communications event to use the data formats that are best suited for that particular instance, where a format is supported by both sides of the connection.  However, a minimum standard is greatly helpful in order to ensure that communication can be achieved.

<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">The methods, mechanisms and requirements for setting up, negotiating and tearing down connections is a large subject, and one where it is desirable to have both interoperability and freedom to innovate.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">The following principles apply:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>The media negotiations will be done using the same SDP offer/answer semantics that are used in SIP <a href="#RFC3264">[RFC3264]</a>, in such a way that it is possible to build a signalling gateway between SIP and the RTCWEB media negotiation.</li>
<li>It will be possible to gateway between legacy SIP devices that support ICE and appropriate RTP / SDP mechanisms and codecs without using a media gateway. A signaling gateway to convert between the signaling on the web side to the SIP signaling may be needed.</li>
<li>When a new codec is specified, and the SDP for the new codec is specified in the MMUSIC WG, no other standardization would should be required for it to be possible to use that in the web browsers.  Adding new codecs which might have new SDP parameters should not change the APIs between the browser and javascript application. As soon as the browsers support the new codecs, old applications written before the codecs were specified should automatically be able to use the new codecs where appropriate with no changes to the JS applications.</li>
</ol>

<p>The particular choices made for RTCWEB are described in &lt;WORKING GROUP DRAFT "SIGNALING AND NEGOTIATION"&gt;.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8">
<a href="#rfc.section.8">8.</a> Presentation and control</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">The most important part of control is the user's control over the browser's interaction with input/output devices and communications channels. It is important that the user have some way of figuring out where his audio, video or texting is being sent, for what purported reason, and what guarantees are made by the parties that form part of this control channel. This is largely a local function between the browser, the underlying operating system and the user interface; this is being worked on as part of the W3C API effort, and will be part of <a href="#webrtc-api">[webrtc-api]</a></p>

<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">These are characterized by the fact that the quality of these functions strongly influences the user experience, but the exact algorithm does not need coordination. In some cases (for instance echo cancellation, as described below), the overall system definition may need to specify that the overall system needs to have some characteristics for which these facilities are useful, without requiring them to be implemented a certain way.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.2">Local functions include echo cancellation, volume control, camera management including focus, zoom, pan/tilt controls (if available), and more.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.3">Certain parts of the system SHOULD conform to certain properties, for instance:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Echo cancellation should be good enough to achieve the suppression of acoustical feedback loops below a perceptually noticeable level.</li>
<li>Privacy concerns must be satisfied; for instance, if remote control of camera is offered, the APIs should be available to let the local participant to figure out who's controlling the camera, and possibly decide to revoke the permission for camera usage.</li>
<li>Automatic gain control, if present, should normalize a speaking voice into &lt;whatever dB metrics makes sense here - most important that we have one only&gt;</li>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.1">Security of the web-enabled real time communications comes in several pieces:</p>
<p><a href="#I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security">[I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security]</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Security of the components: The browsers, and other servers involved. The most target-rich environment here is probably the browser; the aim here should be that the introduction of these components introduces no additional vulnerability.</li>
<li>Security of the communication channels: It should be easy for a participant to reassure himself of the security of his communication - by verifying the crypto parameters of the links he himself participates in, and to get reassurances from the other parties to the communication that they promise that appropriate measures are taken.</li>
<li>Security of the partners' identity: verifying that the participants are who they say they are (when positive identification is appropriate), or that their identity cannot be uncovered (when anonymity is a goal of the application).</li>
</ul>

<p>The security analysis, and the requirements derived from that analysis, is contained in </p>
