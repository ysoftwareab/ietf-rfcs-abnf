1.  Introduction and background

   The recent developments in telecommunication networks, especially in
   the cellular domain, are heading towards transport networks where
   precise time synchronization support has to be one of the basic
   building blocks.  While the transport networks themselves have
   practically transitioned to all-AP packet based networks to meet the
   bandwidth and cost requirements, a highly accurate clock distribution
   has become a challenge.  Earlier the transport networks in the
   cellular domain were typically time division and multiplexing (TDM)
   -based and provided frequency synchronization capabilities as a part
   of the transport media.  Alternatively other technologies such as
   Global Positioning System (GPS) or Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE)
   [SyncE] were used.  New radio access network deployment models and
   architectures may require time sensitive networking services with
   strict requirements on other parts of the network that previously
   were not considered to be packetized at all.  The time and
   synchronization support are already topical for backhaul and midhaul
   packet networks [MEF], and becoming a real issue for fronthaul
   networks.  Specifically in the fronthaul networks the timing and
   synchronization requirements can be extreme for packet based
   technologies, for example, in order of sub +-20 ns packet delay
   variation (PDV) and frequency accuracy of +0.002 PPM [Fronthaul].

   Both Ethernet and IP/MPLS [RFC3031] (and PseudoWires (PWE) [RFC3985]
   for legacy transport support) have become popular tools to build and
   manage new all-IP radio access networks (RAN)
   [I-D.kh-spring-ip-ran-use-case].  Although various timing and
   synchronization optimizations have already been proposed and
   implemented including 1588 PTP enhancements
   [I-D.ietf-tictoc-1588overmpls][I-D.mirsky-mpls-residence-time], these
   solution are not necessarily sufficient for the forthcoming RAN
   architectures or guarantee the higher time-synchronization
   requirements [CPRI].  There are also existing solutions for the TDM
   over IP [RFC5087] [RFC4553] or Ethernet transports [RFC5086].  The
   really interesting and important existing work for time sensitive

   networking has been done for Ethernet [TSNTG], which specifies the
   use of IEEE 1588 time precision protocol (PTP) [IEEE1588] in the
   context of IEEE 802.1D and IEEE 802.1Q.  While IEEE 802.1AS
   [IEEE8021AS] specifies a Layer-2 time synchronizing service other
   specification, such as IEEE 1722 [IEEE1722] specify Ethernet-based
   Layer-2 transport for time-sensitive streams.  New promising work
   seeks to enable the transport of time-sensitive fronthaul streams in
   Ethernet bridged networks [IEEE8021CM].  Similarly to IEEE 1722 there
   is an ongoing standardization effort to define Layer-2 transport
   encapsulation format for transporting radio over Ethernet (RoE) in
   IEEE 1904.3 Task Force [IEEE19043].

   As already mentioned all-IP RANs and various "haul" networks would
   benefit from time synchronization and time-sensitive transport
   services.  Although Ethernet appears to be the unifying technology
   for the transport there is still a disconnect providing Layer-3
   services.  The protocol stack typically has a number of layers below
   the Ethernet Layer-2 that shows up to the Layer-3 IP transport.  It
   is not uncommon that on top of the lowest layer (optical) transport
   there is the first layer of Ethernet followed one or more layers of
   MPLS, PseudoWires and/or other tunneling protocols finally carrying
   the Ethernet layer visible to the user plane IP traffic.  While there
   are existing technologies, especially in MPLS/PWE space, to establish
   circuits through the routed and switched networks, there is a lack of
   signaling the time synchronization and time-sensitive stream
   requirements/reservations for Layer-3 flows in a way that the entire
   transport stack is addressed and the Ethernet layers that needs to be
   configured are addressed.  Furthermore, not all "user plane" traffic
   will be IP.  Therefore, the same solution need also address the use
   cases where the user plane traffic is again another layer or Ethernet
   frames.  There is existing work describing the problem statement
   [I-D.finn-detnet-problem-statement] and the architecture
   [I-D.finn-detnet-architecture] for deterministic networking (DetNet)
   that eventually targets to provide solutions for time-sensitive (IP/
   transport) streams with deterministic properties over Ethernet-based
   switched networks.

   This document describes requirements for deterministic networking in
   a cellular telecom transport networks context.  The requirements
   include time synchronization, clock distribution and ways of
   establishing time-sensitive streams for both Layer-2 and Layer-3 user
   plane traffic using IETF protocol solutions.

2.  Network architecture

   Figure Figure 1 illustrates a typical, 3GPP defined, cellular network
   architecture, which also has fronthaul and midhaul network segments.
   The fronthaul refers to the network connecting base stations (base



Korhonen                Expires November 28, 2015               [Page 3]

   band processing units) to the remote radio heads (antennas).  The
   midhaul network typically refers to the network inter-connecting base
   stations (or small/pico cells).

   Fronthaul networks build on the available excess time after the base
   band processing of the radio frame has completed.  Therefore, the
   available time for networking is actually very limited, which in
   practise determines how far the remote radio heads can be from the
   base band processing units (i.e.  base stations).  For example, in a
   case of LTE radio the Hybrid ARQ processing of a radio frame is
   allocated 3 ms.  Typically the processing completes way earlier (say
   up to 400 us, could be much less, though) thus allowing the remaining
   time to be used e.g. for fronthaul network. 200 us equals roughly 40
   km of optical fiber based transport (assuming round trip time would
   be total 2*200 us).  The base band processing time and the available
   "delay budget" for the fronthaul is a subject to change, possibly
   dramatically, in the forthcoming "5G" to meet, for example, the
   envisioned reduced radio round trip times, and other architecural and
   service requirements [NGMN].

   The maximum "delay budget" is then consumed by all nodes and required
   buffering between the remote radio head and the base band processing
   in addition to the distance incurred delay.  Packet delay variation
   (PDV) is problematic to fronthaul networks and must be minimized.  If
   the transport network cannot guarantee low enough PDV additional
   buffering has to be introduced at the edges of the network to buffer
   out the jitter.  Any buffering will eat up the total available delay
   budget, though.  Section Section 3 will discuss the PDV requirements
   in more detail.

3.  Time synchronization requirements

   Cellular networks starting from long term evolution (LTE) [TS36300]
   [TS23401] radio the phase synchronization is also needed in addition
   to the frequency synchronization.  The commonly referenced fronthaul
   network synchronization requirements are typically drawn from the
   common public radio interface (CPRI) [CPRI] specification that
   defines the transport protocol between the base band processing -
   radio equipment controller (REC) and the remote antenna - radio
   equipment (RE).  However, the fundamental requirements still
   originate from the respective cellular system and radio
   specifications such as the 3GPP ones [TS25104][TS36104][TS36211]
   [TS36133].

   The fronthaul time synchronization requirements for the current 3GPP
   LTE-based networks are listed below:

   Transport link contribution to radio frequency error:

      +-2 PPB.  The given value is considered to be "available" for the
      fronthaul link out of the total 50 PPB budget reserved for the
      radio interface.

   Delay accuracy:

      +-8.138 ns i.e. +-1/32 Tc (UMTS Chip time, Tc, 1/3.84 MHz) to
      downlink direction and excluding the (optical) cable length in one

Internet-Draft               DetNet for RAN                     May 2015


      direction.  Round trip accuracy is then +-16.276 ns.  The value is
      this low to meet the 3GPP timing alignment error (TAE) measurement
      requirements.

   Packet delay variation (PDV):

      *  For multiple input multiple output (MIMO) or TX diversity
         transmissions, at each carrier frequency, TAE shall not exceed
         65 ns (i.e. 1/4 Tc).

      *  For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, with or without
         MIMO or TX diversity, TAE shall not exceed 130 ns (i.e. 1/2
         Tc).

      *  For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, with or
         without MIMO or TX diversity, TAE shall not exceed 260 ns (i.e.
         one Tc).

      *  For inter-band carrier aggregation, with or without MIMO or TX
         diversity, TAE shall not exceed 260 ns.

   The above listed time synchronization requirements are hard to meet
   even with point to point connected networks, not to mention cases
   where the underlying transport network actually constitutes of
   multiple hops.  It is expected that network deployments have to deal
   with the jitter requirements buffering at the very ends of the
   connections, since trying to meet the jitter requirements in every
   intermediate node is likely to be too costly.  However, every measure
   to reduce jitter and delay on the path are valuable to make it easier
   to meet the end to end requirements.

   In order to meet the timing requirements both senders and receivers
   must is perfect sync.  This asks for a very accurate clock
   distribution solution.  Basically all means and hardware support for
   guaranteeing accurate time synchronization in the network is needed.
   As an example support for 1588 transparent clocks (TC) in every
   intermediate node would be helpful.

4.  Time-sensitive stream requirements

   In addition to the time synchronization requirements listed in
   Section Section 3 the fronthaul networks assume practically error
   free transport.  The maximum bit error rate (BER) has been defined to
   be 10^-12.  When packetized that would equal roughly to packet error
   rate (PER) of 2.4*10^-9 (assuming ~300 bytes packets).
   Retransmitting lost packets and/or using forward error coding (FEC)
   to circumvent bit errors are practically impossible due additional
   incurred delay.  Using redundant streams for better guarantees for

Internet-Draft               DetNet for RAN                     May 2015


   delivery is also practically impossible due to high bandwidth
   requirements fronthaul networks have.  For instance, current
   uncompressed CPRI bandwidth expansion ratio is roughly 20:1 compared
   to the IP layer user payload it carries in a "radio sample form".

   The other fundamental assumption is that fronthaul links are
   symmetric.  Last, all fronthaul streams (carrying radio data) have
   equal priority and cannot delay or pre-empt each other.  This implies
   the network has always be sufficiently under subscribed to guarantee
   each time-sensitive flow meets their schedule.

   Mapping the fronthaul requirements to [I-D.finn-detnet-architecture]
   Section 3 "Providing the DetNet Quality of Service" what is seemed
   usable are:

      (a) Zero congestion loss.

      (b) Pinned-down paths.

   The current time-sensitive networking features may still not be
   sufficient for fronthaul traffic.  Therefore, having specific
   profiles that take the requirements of fronthaul into account are
   deemed to be useful [IEEE8021CM].

   The actual transport protocols and/or solutions to establish required
   transport "circuits" (pinned-down paths) for fronthaul traffic are
   still undefined.  Those are likely to include but not limited to
   solutions directly over Ethernet, over IP, and MPLS/PseudoWire
   transport.

5.  Security considerations

   Establishing time-sensitive streams in the network entails reserving
   networking resources sometimes for a considerable long time.  It is
   important that these reservation requests must be authenticated to
   prevent malicious reservation attempts from hostile nodes or even
   accidental misconfiguration.  This is specifically important in a
   case where the reservation requests span administrative domains.
   Furthermore, the reservation information itself should be digitally
   signed to reduce the risk where a legitimate node pushed a stale or
   hostile configuration into the networking node.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations.
