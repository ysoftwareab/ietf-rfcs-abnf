Abstract

   The requirement for the presence of a syntactically-valid message
   header From field in the Internet Message Format presents a problem
   in some circumstances.  This memo (if approved) amends the Internet
   Message Format specifications to make that field optional.
   Discussion of the subject matter covered in this memo has taken place
   on the ietf-822 mailing list, and that would be a suitable place for
   discussion of this document.

1. Introduction

   The Internet Message Format specification [N1.STD11], [N2.RFC2822]
   requires a From field in the message header with a field body
   consisting of a non-empty list of mailboxes for the message authors.
   There are at least two situations where such a list is not practical:

   a. The author has no mailbox ([N1.STD11] example A.2.6 uses the
      sender's mailbox and associates it with a display name different
      from that of the true sender, which may lead to confusion).

Internet Draft          From Field Made Optional           February 2005

      [N2.RFC2822] section 3.6.2 states that the [N1.STD11] A.2.6
      practice of using a mailbox other than the author's is strongly
      deprecated, but does not offer a viable alternative.

   b. The author or authors require anonymity (e.g. whistle-blowing or
      political dissidence)

   The fundamental problem is that the Message Format specification
   requires supplying information which in some circumstances is
   unavailable, and in other circumstances may be harmful, even lethal.
   Several approaches to resolving the problem have been considered:

   a. As mentioned, the [N1.STD11] example A.2.6 method may lead to
      confusion; worse, use of a mailbox for someone other than the
      message author may result in harm to an individual or group
      unrelated to the message.

   b. One might use a syntactically valid but unresolvable domain name
      in the mailbox; however, that interacts badly with gateways
      [I1.RFC2821] to non-Internet mail and non-mail systems (where DNS
      might not be available to the recipient), it is not always easy to
      distinguish an unresolvable name from temporary failure or, worse,
      deliberate return of inappropriate response codes from a name
      server [I2.SiteFinder], and if used widely might result in
      unreasonable load on the root nameservers.

   c. The syntax of the From field body might be changed to an address
      list rather than a mailbox list, allowing a named group with an
      empty set of mailboxes, but that would not be compatible with
      deployed implementations which cannot be expected to cope with
      such an extension to syntax of the field; such syntax is
      explicitly prohibited by [N1.STD11] section 4.4.1.

   d. It is believed that the approach chosen in this memo, viz. to make
      the From field OPTIONAL, has the least adverse impact on the
      Internet of the available solutions to the problem.

2. Requirement Levels

   The key words "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [N3.BCP14].

3. Scope

   This memo (if approved) updates the Internet Message Format
   specification [N1.STD11], [N2.RFC2822] as used by various
   applications (electronic mail [I3.STD10], [I1.RFC2821], Usenet news
   [I4.RFC1036], Internet fax [I5.RFC2305], VPIM [I6.RFC3801], EDI
   [I7.RFC1767], [I8.RFC1865], etc.).  It applies across the board to
   applications using the Internet Message Format.  However it does not
   discuss similarly named fields in unrelated formats and protocols
   such as [I9.HTTP] or [I10.SIP].

   This memo (if approved) relaxes a requirement of the Internet Message
   Format.  It does not preclude specific applications from separately
   requiring a From field, but authors of such specifications SHOULD
   consider the situations discussed in this memo which have lead to the
   relaxation of the Internet Message Format requirement.

4. Amendment of STD 11 (RFC 822)

4.1. RFC 822 section 4.1 SYNTAX

        authentic   =  ["From"       ":"   mailbox] ; Single author
                    / ( "Sender"     ":"   mailbox  ; Actual submittor
                      ["From"       ":" 1#mailbox]) ; Multiple authors
                                                    ;  or not sender

        resent-authentic =  ["Resent-From"      ":"  mailbox]
                          / ( "Resent-Sender"    ":"   mailbox
                            ["Resent-From"      ":" 1#mailbox] )

   The change is that From and Resent-From fields are made optional.

4.2. RFC 822 section 4.4.2 SENDER / RESENT-SENDER

   If the From field is omitted, a Sender field MAY be supplied, but it
   is not REQUIRED.

4.3. RFC 822 section 4.4.4. AUTOMATIC USE OF FROM / SENDER / REPLY-TO

   Clearly in the cases under consideration in this memo (author
   anonymity or lack of mailbox), it is not possible to use a From field
   if no such field is present.  That is expected in the circumstances;
   one cannot reply to an anonymous author, nor send Internet email to
   an author with no Internet mailbox.

4.4. RFC 822 section A.2.6. Agent for user without online mailbox

               A friend  of  George's,  Sarah,  is  visiting.   George's
          secretary  sends  some  mail to a friend of Sarah in computer-
          land.  Replies should go to George, whose mailbox is Jones  at
          Registry.

              Comments: Sent on behalf of Sarah Friendly
              Sender:   Secy-Name <Secy@Registry>
              Reply-To: Jones@Registry.

   The From field is removed, and a Comments field is added to indicate
   the initiator of the communications.

5. Amendment of RFC 2822

5.1. RFC 2822 section 3.6. Field definitions

   from            0*              1               See sender and 3.6.2

Internet Draft          From Field Made Optional           February 2005

   The minimum number of From fields is decreased to zero.

5.2. RFC 2822 section 3.6.2. Originator fields

                          In the absence of the "Reply-To:" field,
   replies SHOULD by default be sent to the mailbox(es) specified in the
   "From:" field, if present, unless otherwise specified by the person
   composing the reply.

   A From field cannot be used if not present.

5.3. RFC 2822 section 3.6.6. Resent fields

   The requirement for a Resent-From field is waived if the resender has
   no Internet mailbox or if the resender requires anonymity.

6. Impact Analysis

   The MIME media type message/rfc822 [I11.RFC2046], section 5.2.1,
   requires one of From, Subject, or Date fields.  In the event that
   there is no From field due to anonymity or lack of an Internet
   mailbox, one of Subject or Date fields would have to be present in
   order to comply with the [I11.RFC2046] requirements.

   Message transport protocols [I3.STD10], [I1.RFC2821], [I12.STD53],
   [I13.RFC3501], [I14.RFC977], etc. do not make use of the From field,
   and so are not affected by this change.

   Similarly, MDNs (Message Disposition Notifications) [I15.RFC3798],
   DSNs (Disposition Status Notifications) [I16.RFC3464], and MTSNs
   (Message Tracking Status Notifications) [I17.RFC3886] do not use the
   message header From field and are therefore unaffected.

   Some documents have suggested use of the reserved ".invalid" TLD
   (top-level domain name) [I18.BCP32] to provide some degree of
   anonymity.  With relaxation of the requirement for a From field in
   the Internet Message Format, such hacks and their negative impact on
   the root name service are unnecessary, at least within the scope of
   Internet Messages.

7. Acknowledgments

   The author gratefully acknowledges the helpful comments provided by
   members of the ietf-822 mailing list.  In particular, Keith Moore has
   made several useful comments.

8. Security Considerations

   No new security considerations are addressed by this memo.  This memo
   relaxes requirements on the Internet Message Format specification
   which have resulted in security problems (specifically due to lack of
   anonymity).  As such, it improves security for message authors who
   require anonymity.

9. Internationalization Considerations

   This memo raises no new internationalization considerations.

10. IANA Considerations

   IANA shall update the From header field registration to include this
   document's RFC number in the list of Specification Documents upon
   approval by the IESG.  At the same time, it would be helpful if IANA
   were to provide useful and meaningful titles for the message header
   field name registry lists, which currently are identified by the
   nonsensical phrases "header messages" and "message header messages".
