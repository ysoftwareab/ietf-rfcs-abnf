         The emergency network scenario for Internet of Things
                  draft-song-iot-emergency-network-00

Abstract

   The Internet is not a conventional network for converying emergency
   data as the telecom network.  But as the emergence of widespread IoT
   applications, huge amount of data collected from sensors or other IoT
   terminals for emergencies will have to be transported through the
   Internet to the close emergency help center.  This document will
   discuss the emergency network use cases and requirements for
   internet.

Status of this Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

1.  Problem Statement

   This informational document is to facilitate the discussion on the
   emergency network issues for internet of things, the problems and the
   requirements.  We will refine this document according to the list
   discussion in IETF/IRTF and related workshops.

   In computing, the Internet of things, also known as the Internet of
   objects, refers to the networked interconnection of everyday objects.

   IoT applications can be widely used to monitor emergencies.  The
   following are some use cases.

   Sensors can be deployed in the sea to monitor the speed and flow
   direction of the sea water.  The data collected from these sensors
   can be used to detect or forecast a tsunami.  It is much earlier than
   the people on the seashore can see it with their own eyes.  The
   emergency and the related data should be forwarded to the
   correspondent information center with high QoS guarantee.

   Another use case is that sensors can spread all over a forest to
   monitor the temperature and humidity.  And in emergency the fire
   alarm can be immediately reported to the fire stations so that
   firemen can react promptly.  The fire alarm and related data
   collected from the sensors may also need to be forwarded immediately
   to some other authorities not far away so as to arrange the people
   and industry near the forest.  And Internet could be the transport
   network.  There are certainly usecases where 3G or LTE networks act
   as the transport, but in this document we only focus on the Internet
   scenario.

   In other use cases the data may also include the data from the
   cameras, which means the amount of the traffic is large.

   The data related to emergency issues can not be regarded as the
   normal Internent data.  If the data can not arrive at the emergency
   center timely, there might be a great loss.  The data itself must not
   be easily modifed or acquired by unauthorized party either.

   During the normal period, Internet does not have to provide high QoS
   for transport of the data from the sensors, but with emergency, the
   Internet should guarantee low delay and the accuracy for the data.
   Internet should have the ability to distinguish the emergency data
   and provide dynamic virtual private network, related bandwidth and
   other mechanisms to ensure QoS.  And there also need a standard way
   to represent the emergency type and data.

2.  Related work in other SDOs

   There are standardization efforts in other SDOs, such like W3C, ANEC,
   BEUC, CCSA.  The speficic standards related to emergency network are
   to be surveyed.


3.  Open Issues

   The following are some of the open issues should be studied in order
   to solve the problems.  Some of them need to be standardized in order
   to facilitate the collaboration of different organizations on
   emergency issues.

   o How the network can distinguish the emergency data flow from the
   ordinary data flow.

   o How to guarantee the delivery service.

   o The language to represent the emergency type and the data.  For
   example, how a emergency can be represented as "Fire_alarm", and a
   standard header or binary code to represent "location".

   o How to locate the destination for the emergency data automatically,
   for example, to the neareast emergency center.  This may be
   application specific.

   o Any other requirements brought by the specific IoT emegency
   application.


4.  Security Considerations

   There are many security aspects needs to be considered for the
   emergency network.  Such as whether the original source is trusted,
   or whether the emergency data is protected to avoid malicious attack
   during the transmission.  In some cases, not all the emegeny soures
   give the consistent data, but the judgement can be made compliant to
   the majority.


5.  IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA consideration in this document.
