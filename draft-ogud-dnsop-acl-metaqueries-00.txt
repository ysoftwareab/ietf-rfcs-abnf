                      DNS Meta-Queries resticted.
                  draft-ogud-dnsop-acl-metaqueries-00

Abstract

   Some DNS types have special meaning and are classified as meta
   queries, this includes ANY, AXFR, IXFR.  These queries frequently
   return larger answers than queries for other types.

   This document defines a standard way for Authoritative-Only servers
   how to refuse to serve these and other similar queries, with the
   expectation that resolvers honor that, by not asking followup
   queries.

1.  Introduction

   The DNS Specification [RFC1035] meta queries where defined for use
   either zone maintainance AXFR, full zone transfer, IXFR [RFC1995],
   incremental zone transfer.  For security reasons Authoritative name
   servers frequently only respond to these queries if a TSIG [RFC2845]
   key is presented or the query comes from an approved address.

   The ANY meta query was defined for debugging purposes mainly against
   resolvers.  There have been widespread misunderstanding as to what
   the query is supposed to do and when it is approriate.  The query is
   intented for testing what records for a particular name a resolver
   has in its cache.  There are security implications related to
   information leaks and use in DoS attacks that strongly argue for
   restricting its use like the other Meta Queries.

   RRSIG [RFC4034] type used in a query can also return large answers as
   the server attempts to put all RRSIG records at that one name into
   one answer.  This type was envisioned as deployment tool for
   validators to overcome DNSSEC ignorant resolvers and/or servers.  For
   all practical purposes this is never needed.

Internet-Draft         Resticting DNS Meta-Queries            March 2015


   Queries yielding large answers are known to be widely abused by
   attackers carrying out reflection attacks, since they provide a
   convenient way to elicit large responses from small queries, and
   hence exhibit significant amplification potential.  A similar
   reaction to an operational security problem can be observed in the
   advice contained within [RFC5358].

   The data model used by some authoritative-only DNS server
   implementations does not align easily with the zone structure
   described in [RFC1035], and responding accurately to meta queries
   involves significant processing overhead.  The ability to refuse meta
   queries can simplify the implementation with corresponding benefits
   to performance and code correctness.

   Recursive Resovlers frequently treat REFUSED as a temporary denial.
   In the case of policy statement that certain queries will not
   answered, having a more explicit statment is beneficial.  There are
   two chocies as how more permanent semantics can be expressed, reusing
   an exisiting RCODE or define a new one.  This docuemnt proposes
   reusing the NOTIMP rcode.  This feels like the right choice as as far
   as the querier is concerned it makes no difference if the meta type
   is implemented or the authoritative server has no interest in
   providing that service to the client.  There are other options like
   defining new RCODE or place stronger semantics on REFUSED.

   Various DNS operators have chosen to refuse various meta queries
   including QTYPE=ANY in the past, using a variety of approaches,
   including rate-limiting of queries and responses, returning TC=1 on
   qeries received via UDP transport and silently dropping queries
   before they reach the DNS server.  Consistency in approach would
   provide a more predictable outcome for DNS resolvers and clients.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Protocol Changes

   DNS processing entities SHOULD support authenticated meta queries,
   and process them when appropriate as defined by policy.  By default
   the implemenations SHOULD be restrict it to localhost via ACL.  For
   all rejected meta-queries the behavior specified below SHOULD be
   used.  The types where this behavior is appropriate includes ANY,
   AXFR, IXFR, RRSIG.

Internet-Draft         Resticting DNS Meta-Queries            March 2015


   An authoritative-only DNS server MAY reject meta queries received by
   returning RCODE=4 (NOTIMP).

   An iterative resolver MUST NOT forward a meta-query when the query
   arrives with RD=0, even when it has no types for that name.  An
   iterative resolver SHOULD ignore RD=1 on a meta query, i.e. it SHOULD
   NOT forward them upstream.

   An iterative resolver that sends a query to an authoritative DNS
   server and receives a response with RCODE=4 SHOULD remember that
   upstream server's behaviour, for that qclass, qname, qtype
   combination.  It SHOULD suppress any subsequent qeries for that
   qclass, qname, qtype to that server for at least one day (??? better
   value needed).

4.  IANA Considerations

   No actions are requested of the IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   In the original Internet where everyone behaved nicely had different
   secrity and operating model than todays Internet.  This document is
   defining how DNS servers can express that they will never answer a
   particular query from a given address.

   RCODE=REFUSED is frequently treated as temporary thus resolver may
   repeat queries in the hope of getting an answer.

   An on-path attacker[RFC3833] can forge these answers easily, but as
   that document explains the attacker can anyway inject any lies it
   wants to.

6.  Implementation Experience

   TBD

   Based on feeback from dnsop mailing list, we Expaned the scope of the
   document to cover "META" types in general, and express that
   RCODE=NOTIMP should be cached by resolvers.  Changed language so it
   is more neutral to as what path this work takes.
