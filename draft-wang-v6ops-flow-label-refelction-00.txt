Abstract

   IPv6 Flow Label field in IPv6 packet header is designed to
   differentiate the various traffic flow session within network.
   Current related RFCs(RFC 6437 and RFC 6438 etc.)describe the IPv6
   Flow Label generation recommendation and usage in network traffic
   load balance. But all of these documents focus mainly how the packet
   source forms the value of this field and how the forwarder in-path
   treats it. None of the existing documents describes the relation
   between the flow label from source nodes and its corresponding value
   in return packet. This draft describes the requirements for flow
   label reflection between the upstream session and the corresponding
   downstream session, the benefit of this mirroring mechanism and its
   influence to the current proposed IPv6 flow label usage. This
   mechanism is unique to IPv6, and should be exploited to promote the
   deployment of IPv6 technology in more rapid pace.

1. Introduction

   IPv6 flow label is designed to differentiate the flow session of
   IPv6 traffic; it can accelerate the clarification and treatment of
   IPv6 traffic by the network devices in its forwarding path.
   Currently, the usage of this field mainly focus on the traffic load-
   balance in ECMP(Equal Cost Multi-Path)environment or the server load
   balance(see RFC7098),these usages only exploit the characteristic of
   IPv6 flow label field in one direction, and do not consider the
   requirement to correlate the upstream and downstream traffic of one
   session together to create new service model, to simply the traffic
   policy deployment and to increase the accuracy of network traffic
   recognition.

   In this draft, we analyze several scenarios for the flow label
   reflection; illustrate the benefit of keeping flow label unchanged
   in the downstream and upstream of one IPv6 traffic session and give
   the detail IPv6 flow label reflect process in DS-Lite,NAT64 and IPv6
   end-to-end communication environment.

   Further deployment requirements and solutions are welcomed and will
   be studied later.

4. Flow Label Reflection Mechanism

4.1. Summary of the current usage for IPv6 Flow Label

   [RFC 6438] describe the usage of IPv6 Flow Label for ECMP and link
   aggregation in Tunnels, it mainly utilize the random distribution
   characteristic of IPv6 flow label. [RFC 7098] also describe similar
   usage case in server farm. All these usage scenarios consider only
   the usage of IPv6 flow label in one direction, and do not utilize
   fully the core definition and role of IPv6 flow label for one
   session. From the point view of service provider, the upstream and
   downstream of one session should be handled together, then give them
   the same label value will be more beneficial.

   Following paragraph analyze several scenarios that require to use
   IPv6 flow label reflection mechanism. Other use case needs to
   further study.

4.2. Various scenarios for requirements of flow label reflection

   This section describes some scenarios that require the IPv6 flow
   label reflection in IPv6 source and destination nodes. Other similar
   situations may be required further study.

4.2.1. DS-Lite deployment case

   During IPv6 transition stage, some service provider select the DS-
   Lite[RFC 6333] technology to accelerate the deployment of IPv6
   within their network. DS-Lite has the beneficial to eliminate the
   needs to assign the IPv4 address to the subscribers and simplify the
   administration of network, but it has one disadvantage that
   encapsulates all IPv4 traffic from one customer into IPv6 packet and
   the router in-path, such as BRAS,CR etc. cannot see the inner IPv4
   destination information.

   On the other hand, service provider want to differentiate the
   traffic within their transport pipe, which is based on the
   requirement from upper CP/SP(Content provider). The general
   architecture to achieve this goal is illustrated in Figure-1:

                    Host      Host

                  Figure-1: DS-Lite Deployment Scenarios

   Within Figure-1, CPE acts as B4 to encapsulate the IPv4 traffic from
   host under it into IPv6 packet. According to the current IPv6 node
   requirement, CPE is responsible to allocate one random/well
   distribution value to the flow label, to indicate the different IPv4
   flow from host is belong to different flow session.

   The encapsulate IPv6 traffic pass through BRAS and CR, ends in AFTR
   which will decapsulate IPv6 traffic into IPv4 packet and return it
   to CR, the CR will pass the decapsulated IPv4 packet to CP/SP. If
   the CP/SP wants more bandwidth or quick process, they will deliver
   the destination IP and port information to the "Policy Controller",
   which will control the AFTR and then to lift the bandwidth limit on
   BRAS.

   For BRAS to act correctly to the appointed IPv4 traffic, it should
   know the corresponding IPv6 flow label. If the upstream IPv6 flow
   label is different from the downstream IPv6 label, the ACL lists in
   BRAS will be quite complex, the upstream and downstream of one
   session must be processed separately. This will increase the burden
   of service provider to deploy intelligent network policy.

4.2.2. Deep Packet Inspection case

   Internet service providers are now deploying more DPI(Deep packet
   inspection) devices within their network to accomplish the
   visualization of traffic type in their communication pipe and wish
   to optimize their network structure based on these information. The
   accuracy of the DPI devices' traffic recognition will influence the
   effect of network optimization and controlling policy.

   To increase the traffic recognition rate, the DPI device should
   track the upstream and downstream of one session simultaneously, in
   order to find the symptoms of various traffic, especially for P2P
   traffic.  If the IPv6 flow label of upstream and downstream is
   different, and the three tuple <IPv6 source address, IPv6
   destination address, flow label> is used to load balance among
   different links between BRAS and CR, as illustrated in Figure-2, the
   upstream and downstream of one session will be distributed into
   different links, thus increases the difficult of traffic recognition
   that is based on the correlation of downstream and upstream of one
   session.

4.2.3. End to End QoS deployment within Mobile Internet

   Under the mobile Internet environment, the service provider can
   control the traffic parameter from UE directly. Based on the common
   architecture as illustrated in Figure-3 below for end to end QoS
   deployment within Mobile Internet, UE will get the QCI parameter
   from PCRF, and the traffic from this UE will be treated differently
   according to its service subscription. If the QCI parameters can be
   mapped to the IPv6 flow label in underlying transport layer and the
   value of upstream and downstream is kept same, the transport devices
   can treat the required flow different very easily.

   Specially, under the situation of UE to UE communicate directly, the
   traffic initiated by the privilege user will be processed in high
   priority, even it communicate with one low precedence user; and the
   traffic initiated by the normal user will be processed in default
   queue, even it communicate with one privilege user. This traffic
   model matches with the service provider's business model and can be
   easily accomplished.

4.3. Recommendation and Benefit of Flow Label Reflection Mechanism

   Based on the scenarios described above, we propose the following
   solution:



<Wang>                 Expires January 3, 2015                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    Flowlabel Reflection Requirement           July 2014


   1.           The value of IPv6 Flow Label should be reflected and kept
      unchanged by the receiving IPv6 node.

   2.           Under such reflection mechanism, the IPv6 Flow Label will be used
      unambiguously to indicate one session's upstream and downstream
      traffic:

      a) The service provider can easily apply the same policy to the
         bi-direction traffic of one interested session;

      b) The traffic analyzer can also easily correlate the upstream and
         downstream of one session to find the symptoms of various
         internet protocol.

      c) The service provider can offer differentiated service based on
         the user's privilege condition and their service in use, make
         the Non-equivalent service possible under the end-to-end
         communication model in mobile internet environment.

   3.           The generation method of IPv6 flow label in source IPv6 node and
      the forward behavior are still recommended to follow the
      guidelines in RFC 6437, that is the IPv6 flow label should be
      generated randomly and distributed enough, the devices in the
      traffic forwarding path should not changed it.

4.4. Detail of Flow Label Reflection Mechanism

4.4.1. DS-Lite environment

   Under DS-Lite environment, the B4/CPE and AFTR are the two ends of
   IPv6 communication:

      a) B4/CPE is responsible for the generation of IPv6 packet, and is
         responsible for the initial value of IPv6 flow label. Because
         all IPv4 traffic from it is encapsulated into one IPv6 tunnel
         packet, the value of IPv6 flow label should distinguish the
         inner different IPv4 flow. Recommending algorithm is to use the
         5-tuple of IPv4 traffic as the input of hash function.

      b) AFTR is responsible for the decapsulting of IPv6 traffic. The
         original IPv6 flow label should be kept in the stateful table
         in AFTR, along with the mapping entry of "private IPv4
         source/port, IPv6 source address, public IPv4 source/port,
         protocol".

      c) Once the responsible IPv4 traffic back to AFTR, it should check
         the above mapping table, NAT and encapsulate the IPv4 traffic,


<Wang>                 Expires January 3, 2015                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    Flowlabel Reflection Requirement           July 2014


         set the IPv6 flow label of returned encapsulated IPv6 packet to
         the previous stored value.

4.4.2. NAT64 environment

   Under NAT64 environment, the IPv6 host and the NAT64 device is the
   two IPv6 communication ends:

      a) IPv6 host is responsible for the generation of IPv6 packet, and
         is responsible for the initial value of IPv6 flow label.
         Recommending algorithm is to use the 5-tuple of IPv6 traffic as
         the input of hash function.

      b) NAT64 is the other end of IPv6 communication session. It should
         record the original value of IPv6 flow label in upstream in its
         NAT table, along with the mapping entry of "IPv6 source
         address/port, public IPv4 source address/port, protocol"

      c) Once the responsible IPv4 traffic back to NAT64 device, it
         should retrieve the corresponding original value of IPv6 flow
         label in the above mentioned mapping table, put it in the
         header of downstream converted IPv6 traffic.



4.4.3. End to End IPv6 communication environment

   It is more simple to do IPv6 flow label reflection under the end to
   end Ipv6 communication environment:

      a) IPv6 source host is responsible for the generation of IPv6
         packet, and is responsible for the initial value of IPv6 flow
         label. Recommending algorithm is to use the 5-tuple of IPv6
         traffic as the input of hash function.

      b) IPv6 destination host just copy the original IPv6 flow label to
         its corresponding field in reply packet.

      c) There is no need to keep the value of IPv6 flow label in
         forwarding path.



4.5. Influence to the current usage of IPv6 Flow Label

   There is no any influence to the current proposed usages of IPv6
   flow label.

5. Security Considerations

   In order to keep the IPv6 flow label unchanged and same in the
   upstream and downstream of one session, the in-path devices, which
   is required in the IPv6 transition period, such as AFTR/NAT64 etc.
   should be required to store the IPv6 flow label value, retrieve and
   restore it in the downstream traffic. This may increase the burden
   of such stateful devices within service provider's network and lower
   the anti-attack capabilities of these devices.  This threat exists
   only in the transition period and will disappear in the IPv6 end-to-
   end communication period.

6. IANA Considerations

   There is no additional IANA requirement for this requirement.

7. Conclusions

   IPv6 flow label reflection mechanism makes the downstream and
   upstream of one session be easily recognized, let the service
   provider take the full control of one session's bi-direction traffic
   and apply the same traffic policy to them. It also let the
   correlation of traffic and then the recognition of various traffics
   easier. Based on such mechanism, the service provider can also offer
   Non-equivalent service in IPv6 end-to-end communication environment,
   especially in IPv6 based mobile internet circumstance.
