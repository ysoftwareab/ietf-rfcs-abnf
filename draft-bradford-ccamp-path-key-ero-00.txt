   Abstract 
    
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) 
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) may be computed by Path Computation 
   Elements (PCEs). Where the TE LSP crosses multiple domains, such 
   as Autonomous Systems (ASs), the path may be computed by multiple 
   PCEs that cooperate, with each responsible for computing a segment 
   of the path. To preserve confidentiality of topology with each AS, 
   the PCE supports a mechanism to hide the contents of a segment of 
   a path, called the Confidential Path Segment (CPS), by encoding 
   the contents as a Path Key Sub-object (PKS). This draft describes 
   the addition of this object to the Explicit Route Object.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

1.  Introduction 
    
   This document proposes RSVP-TE protocol extensions necessary to 
   support the protocol extensions called out in [PCE-PKS]. 
    
2.  Terminology 
     
   CPS: Confidential Path Segment. A segment of a path that contains 
   nodes and links that the AS policy requires to not be disclosed 
   outside the AS. 
    
   PCE: Path Computation Element: an entity (component, application 
   or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or 
   route based on a network graph and applying computational 
   constraints. 
    
   PKS: Path Key Sub-object. A sub-object of an Explicit Route Object 
   which encodes a CPS, so as to preserve confidentiality. 
    
3.  RSVP-TE Path Key Sub-object 
    
    
   The Path Key sub-object (PKS) may be carried in the Explicit Route 
   Object (ERO) of a RSVP-TE Path message [RFC3209]. The PKS is a

   fixed-length sub-object containing a Path-Key and a PCE-ID. The 
   Path Key is an identifier, or token used to represent the CPS 
   within the context of the PCE identified by the PCE-ID. The PCE-ID 
   identifies the PCE that can decode the Path Key using a reachable 
   IPv4 or IPv6 address of the PCE. Because of the IPv4 and IPv6 
   variants, two subobjects are defined as follows. 
    
     0                   1                   2                   3

         L 
    
         The L bit SHOULD NOT be set, so that the sub-object 
   represents a strict hop in the explicit route.

         Length 
    
         The Length contains the total length of the subobject in 
   bytes, including the Type and Length fields.  The Length is always 
   8. 
    
         IPv4 address 
    
         An IPv4 address of the PCE that can decode this key. The 
   address used SHOULD be an address of the PCE that is always 
   reachable, and MAY be an address that is restricted to the domain 
   in which the LSR that is called upon to expand the CPS lies.

       Type 
    
          TBD  Path Key with IPv6 address 
    
       Length 
    
          The Length contains the total length of the subobject in 
   bytes, including the Type and Length fields.  The Length is always 
   20. 
    
       IPv6 address 
    
          An IPv6 address of the PCE that can decode this key. The 
   address used SHOULD be an address of the PCE that is always 
   reachable, but MAY be an address that is restricted to the domain 
   in which the LSR that is called upon to expand the CPS lies. 
    
   Note: The twins of these sub-objects will be carried in a PCEP 
   PCRep message as defined in [PCE-PKS]. Ideally, IANA assignment of 
   the sub-object types will be identical. 
    
4.  Security Considerations 
    
   This document proposes tunneling secure topology information 
   across an untrusted AS, so the security considerations are many 
   and apply to PCEP and RSVP-TE. 
   Issues include: 
  - Security of the CPS (can other network elements probe for 
     expansion of path-keys, possibly at random?). 
  - Authenticity of the path-key (resilience to alteration by 
     intermediaries, resilience to fake expansion of path-keys). 
  - Resilience from DNS attacks (insertion of spurious path-keys; 
     flooding of bogus path-key expansion requests). 
    
5.  Manageability Considerations 
    
   TBD 
    
6.  IANA considerations 
    
   The IANA section will be detailed in further revision of this 
   document. 
    
   For RSVP, it will include code point requests for the three new 
   ERO sub-objects, and a new ErrorSpec Error Code.

   For PCEP, it will include code point requests for the three new 
   computed path sub-objects. 
    
    
7.  Intellectual Property Considerations 
    
   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
   Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be claimed 
   to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology

   such rights. Information on the procedures with respect to rights 
   in RFC documents can be found in BCP 78 and BCP 79. 
    
   Copies of IPR disclosures made to the IETF Secretariat and any 
   assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an 
   attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use 
   of such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this 
   specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR repository 
   at http://www.ietf.org/ipr. 
    
   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention 
   any copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other 
   proprietary rights that may cover technology that may be required
