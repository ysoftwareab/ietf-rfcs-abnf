Internet-Draft        pcp subscriber identification         October 2010


1.  Introduction

   PCP is primarily designed to be implemented in the context of large
   scale NAT deployments.  It offers the ability to configure a port
   forwarding capability in Service Provider NATs.  In a Service
   Provider case, subscriber identification and security are two of the
   important features.  It's the basic of providing port service and
   accounting.

   In Section 8.3 Subscriber Identification of current PCP
   protocol[I-D.draft-wing-softwire-port-control-protocol], PCP server
   uses IP address or prefix to identify PCP subscribers.  However, PCP
   is a lightweight protocol and no connection is required to be
   maintained between the Client and the Server.  It's very easy to
   create a fake IP address in many cases, so PCP server could not
   differentiate between legitimate requests and fake requests.  Due to
   these reasons, ISPs need more reliable technology to enhance the
   security.

   Generally in ISP networks, Broadband Network Gateway(BNG), aka
   Broadband Remote Access Server, provides the access authentication
   for subscribers.  The BNG can identify by means of subscribers
   information besides IP address, for example MAC address, Circuit ID
   of access device which subscribers are attached to [RFC3046], etc.
   If PCP server is embedded into BNG, it can identify a PCP client with
   the information provided by BNG.  In this case, PCP operations have
   high security.

   However, PCP server is usually coupled with Service Provider NAT
   rather than BNG.  When PCP server is separated from BNG, it can only
   identify PCP client by IP address, which may cause significant
   security problems.

   This document mainly focuses on the security problems in the
   separated scenario and methods on how to solve these problems.

2.  Security problem analysis of PCP separated scenario

   PCP is a simple protocol based on UDP.  It achieves its purpose by
   one simply request/response procedure.  In separated scenario, these
   steps are vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS), unwanted deleting of
   mappings, man-in-the-middle(MITM), and have stale mapping problem.

2.1.  DoS attacking with address spoofing

   Section 11.4 of PCP recommends IPv6 source address validation to
   protect against creating unwanted mappings.  However, an adversary
   can flood the PCP requests with bogus source address, which satisfies
   the validation rules, to cause DoS attacks exhausting mapping
   resources.  PCP server will allocate mappings for these illegal
   requests.  The limited mapping resources will soon be exhausted,
   causing legitimate subscribers not having available resources.

2.2.  Unwanted Deleting of Mappings

   In PCP, requests with internal IP address and lifetime set to zero
   are used to delete all mappings of a subscriber.  An adversary can
   flood the PCP requests with bogus source address deleting legitimate
   mappings.  By trying a large number of source addresses, an adversary
   may successfully delete some legitimate mappings.  This kind of
   attack will disrupt the normal PCP uses.

2.3.  MITM attack

   An adversary may try to eavesdrop and collect PCP requests.  The
   normal request message contains some internal port numbers the PCP
   client wants to request.  Adversary may increase a large number of
   fake internal ports and replay these requests.  Then PCP server has
   to allocate some additional mappings that are unnecessary.  If a
   large number of PCP requests are modified, the mapping resources
   would be exhausted.  On the other way, by setting the lifetime and
   internal address to zero, an adversary may successfully delete some
   mappings to disrupt normal PCP uses.

2.4.  Stale Mappings

   Section 11.6 of [I-D.wing-softwire-port-control-protocol] has
   described this problem.

3.  Possible solutions

   This section will introduce several possible solutions to
   authenticate legitimate clients.  According to different operating
   environment, ISPs could choose different method.

3.1.  Authentication model for PCP

   User name and password of a subscriber can be used to enhance PCP
   security.  As shown in figure 1, PCP client sends request message
   with an extended Informational Element(IE) including user name and
   password to the PCP server.  Then PCP server, as an AAA client,
   authenticates with AAA server via Diameter[RFC3588]/Radius
   protocol[RFC2865].  Only when the authentication succeeds can the PCP
   server start to allocate mappings to PCP client.

                            +---------+
                            |         |
                            |   AAA   |
                            |  server |
                            +---------+
                                 |
                                 |
                                 |
                                 |
       +---------+          +---------+             +----------+
       |   PCP   |          |   PCP   |             |          |
       |  client |----------|  server |-------------| Internet |
       |         |          |         |             |          |
       +---------+          +---------+             +----------+

   Figure 1: Authentication model

   With the adoption of the user name and password identification
   procedure, the DoS attack, unwanted mapping deleting and stale
   mapping problem can be well defended against.  This procedure doesn't
   change the original PCP procedure for there are no new steps.
   However, it adds AAA procedure.

3.2.  Random number

   With this method, when PCP server receives a PCP request from a
   subscriber for the first time, it will reply an Error Response with a
   random number without allocating mappings to the PCP client.  The
   random number can be contained in an IE.  When a PCP client receives
   this response with random number, it will resend another PCP request
   with the same random number IE.  The IE should be stored for later
   PCP communication.

Internet-Draft        pcp subscriber identification         October 2010


   With the random number method, when DoS attack with faked source
   address arrives, PCP server will not allocate mappings immediately.
   On the contrary, it replies a packet to the faked source address to
   ask the PCP client for another request with the random number, which
   the attackers will never receive.  Furthermore, random number is
   valuable against unwanted deleting of mappings.

   However, it cannot defend MITM attacks.  This method increases steps
   of PCP communication procedure at the first time.

3.3.  Safe tunnel negotiation

   This method suggests a safe tunnel like TLS or IPsec to be
   established between PCP client and server before the starting of PCP
   communication.  Based on the established safe tunnel, the PCP
   communication would be safe.  All the problems stated in section 2
   could be solved.  Note that the negotiation procedure could be
   separated from PCP communication.

   As we known that PCP is designed as a lightweight protocol.  However,
   safe tunnel negotiation would makes the whole PCP procedure
   complicate.  Especially, PCP server needs to process a large number
   of encrypted/decrypted information to establish safe tunnel.  The
   costs for safe tunnel establishing may be more than that of PCP
   procedure itself.

3.4.  Digit signature

   The digit signature method suggests that PCP request and response
   messages should have an extended IE including digitally signed random
   number.  The random number is firstly generated by PCP server.  Every
   time when PCP server needs to send a response, it should generate a
   new random number and signs this random number.  Figure 2 is a simple
   procedure of the digit signature method.

  +---------+                                                 +---------+
  |   PCP   |                                                 |   PCP   |
  |  client |                                                 |  server |
  |         |                                                 |         |
  +---------+                                                 +---------+
     |     PCP request with digitally signed random number          |
     | ------------------------------------------------------->     |
     |                                                              |
     |                                                              |
     |    PCP response with digitally signed random number          |
     | <-------------------------------------------------------     |

   This method is considered to be more secure than random number method
   and not as complicated as safe tunnel negotiation method.
