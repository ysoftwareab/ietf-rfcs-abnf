Abstract

   This document defines YANG modules that augment the System Management
   data model defined in the RFC 7317 with TACACS+ client model.  The
   data model of Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus
   (TACACS+) client allows the configuration of TACACS+ servers for
   centralized Authentication, Authorization and Accounting.

   The YANG modules in this document conforms to the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in RFC 8342.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines YANG modules that augment the System Management
   data model defined in the [RFC7317] with TACACS+ client model.

   TACACS+ provides Device Administration for routers, network access
   servers and other networked computing devices via one or more
   centralized servers which is defined in the TACACS+ Protocol.
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs]

   The System Management Model [RFC7317] defines two YANG features to
   support local or RADIUS authentication:

   o  User Authentication Model: Defines a list of usernames and
      passwords and control the order in which local or RADIUS
      authentication is used.

   o  RADIUS Client Model: Defines a list of RADIUS servers that a
      device uses.

   Since TACACS+ is also used for device management and the feature is
   not contained in the System Management model, this document defines a
   YANG data model that allows users to configure TACACS+ client
   functions on a device for centralized Authentication, Authorization
   and Accounting provided by TACACS+ servers.

Internet-Draft             TACACS+ YANG model              November 2019


   The YANG models can be used with network management protocols such as
   NETCONF[RFC6241] to install, manipulate, and delete the configuration
   of network devices.

   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP14, [RFC2119], [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are used in this
   specification:

   o  client

   o  configuration data

   o  server

   o  state data

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950] and are used in this
   specification:

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

2.1.  Tree Diagrams

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

3.  Design of the Data Model

   This model is used to configure TACACS+ client on the device to
   support deployment scenarios with centralized authentication,
   authorization, and accounting servers.  Authentication is used to

   validate a user's name and password, authorization allows the user to
   access and execute commands at various command levels assigned to the
   user and accounting keeps track of the activity of a user who has
   accessed the device.

   The ietf-system-tacacsplus module is intended to augment the
   "/sys:system" path defined in the ietf-system module with
   "tacacsplus" grouping.  Therefore, a device can use local, Remote
   Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS), or Terminal Access
   Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+) to validate users who
   attempt to access the router by several mechanisms, e.g. a command
   line interface or a web-based user interface.

   The "server" list is directly under the "tacacsplus" container, which
   holds a list of TACACS+ servers and uses server-type to distinguish
   between the three protocols.  The list of servers is for redundancy.

   Most of the parameters in the "server" list are taken directly from
   the TACACS+ protocol [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs], and some are derived
   from the various implementations by network equipment manufacturers.
   For example, when there are multiple interfaces connected to the
   TACACS+ client or server, the source address of outgoing TACACS+
   packets could be specified, or the source address could be specified
   through the interface setting, or derived from the out-bound
   interface from the local FIB.  For the TACACS+ server located in a
   Virtual Private Network(VPN), a VRF instance needs to be specified.

   The "statistics" container under the "server list" is to record
   session statistics and usage information during user access which
   include the amount of data a user has sent and/or received during a
   session.

   The data model for TACACS+ client has the following structure:

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
   layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
   Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   This document describes the use of TACACS+ for purposes of
   authentication, authorization and accounting, it is vulnerable to all
   of the threats that are present in TACACS+ applications.  For a
   discussion of such threats, see Section 9 of the TACACS+ Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registration is
   requested to be made:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system-tacacsplus
      Registrant Contact: The IESG.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.



   This document registers a YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC7950].

Appendix A.  TACACS+ Authentication Configuration

   The system management model defines two authentication configuration
   options and controls authentication methods by configuring "user-
   authentication-order" . One is "local-users", and the other is
   "radius".

   This draft defines the "tacacsplus" model extension and therefore
   needs to be configured in the same way.  The 'tacacsplus' identity is
   defined to control whether or not TACACS+ authentication should be
   used.  The current system authentication configuration model is as
   follows:
