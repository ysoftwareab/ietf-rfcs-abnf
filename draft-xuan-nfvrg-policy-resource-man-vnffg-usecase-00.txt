          Use cases for policy-based resource management in VNF-FG
         draft-xuan-nfvrg-policy-resource-man-vnffg-usecase-00

			  
   Abstract
   
   This document describes two use cases for policy-based resource 
   management in VNF-FG. These two use cases are not covered by two 
   documents [irtf-nfvrg-resource-management] and 
   [irtf-nfvrg-policy-based-resource-management]. These two use cases
   considers service plan policies in VNF-FG placement and affinity
   policies in Network forwarding path update.

1. Introduction
   
   In this document, two additional use cases are discussed on policies
   which affect the resource management operations for VNF-FG. These 
   policies include service plan policies for customer in case of 
   VNF-FG placement and update. Another is affinity policies for VNF-FG
   update.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].


    The terms about VNF-I, VL, VNF-FG, classifers and MANO are defined 
    in [RFC7665] and [ETSI-NFV-MANO]

3. Policy-based resource management for VNF-FG

VNF-FG is composed of an ordered sequence of VNFs which provides a 
specific services. A network forwarding path (NFP) is an instance of 
VNF-FG. NFP is composed by VNF intances (VNF-I), virtual links (VL),
virtual switches (vSW or forwarder), and traffic classifiers. The 
NFP composition depends on the resource states, such as availability,
engergy consumption of VNF-I and bandwidth, latency of VL. Two resource
management oprations related to VNF-FG are NFP placement and NFP 
update. In the document [irtf-nfvrg-resource-management], some use 
uses for resource management include fail-over, load-balancing,
path optimizaton, and engergy efficiency. Here, we present another
use case for policy-based resource management, i.e. service plan.

Service plan: depending on the service plan of each customer,the 
NFP will allocated which takes into account the QoS parameters. 
For example, a customer with Gold service plan will be served 
by the NFP which consists of VNF-I, VL, vSW, and traffic classifiers
satisfying the QoS parameters of that Gold plan.

                 Figure 2. Policy-based NFP placement

+ Affinity and anti-affinity policies: the NFP is updated which 
takes into account the affinity or anti-affinity policies. For example,
when a VNF-I in the NFP fails, the replacement VNF-I should satisfy 
some anti-affinity policies defined by network operators for achieving 
the resiliency. That is, the replacement VNF-I and failed VNF-I 
instances should be located in the different physical hosts or 
hypervisors or NFVIs.
