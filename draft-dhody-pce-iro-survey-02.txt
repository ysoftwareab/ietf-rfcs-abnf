Informal Survey into Include Route Object (IRO) Implementations in Path
           Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP)
                     draft-dhody-pce-iro-survey-02

Abstract

   During discussions of a document to provide a standard representation
   and encoding of Domain-Sequence within the Path Computation Element
   (PCE) communication Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between two PCEs.  It was
   determined that there was a need for clarification with respect to
   the ordered nature of the Include Route Object (IRO).

   Since there was a proposal to have a new IRO type with ordering, as
   well as handling of Loose bit (L-Bit), it felt necessary to conduct a
   survey of the existing and planned implementations.

   This document summarizes the survey questions and captures the
   results.  Some conclusions are also presented.

   This survey was informal and conducted via email.  Responses were
   collected and anonymized by the PCE working group chairs.

1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.

   [RFC5440] defines the Include Route Object (IRO) to specify that the
   computed path must traverse a set of specified network elements.  The
   specification did not mention if IRO is an ordered or un-ordered list
   of sub-objects.  It mentioned that the L bit (loose) has no meaning
   within an IRO.

   [RFC5441] suggested the use of IRO to indicate the sequence of
   domains to be traversed during inter-domain path computation.

Internet-Draft                 IRO-SURVEY                  December 2014


   During discussion of [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-domain-sequence] it was
   proposed to have a new IRO type with ordered nature, as well as
   handling of L bit.

   In order to discover the current state of affairs amongst
   implementations a survey of the existing and planned implementations
   was conducted.  This survey was informal and conducted via email.
   Responses were collected and anonymized by the PCE working group
   chair.

   This document summarizes the survey questions and captures the
   results.  Some conclusions are also presented.

2.  Survey Details

2.1.  Survey Preamble

   The survey was introduced with the following text.

   Hi PCE WG.

   To address the issues associated with draft-ietf-pce-pcep-domain-
   sequence and "Include Route Object" in PCEP, Dhruv has proposed to
   start a small survey.  If implementers agree that we need to clarify
   this, they would be much welcome to answer the attached questions.

   Dhruv will process the results, but to improve confidentiality,
   answers may be sent privately to the chairs.

   Thanks,

   JP & Julien, on behalf of Dhruv

2.2.  Survey Questions

   The following survey questions were asked, the survey questionnaire
   is listed verbatim below.


       During discussion of draft-ietf-pce-pcep-domain-sequence-05,
       it has been noted that RFC 5440 does not define whether the
       sub-objects in the IRO are ordered or unordered.

       We would like to do an informal and *confidential* survey
       of current implementations, to help clarify this
       situation.

       1. IRO Encoding

           a. Does your implementation construct IRO?

           b. If your answer to part (a) is Yes, does your
              implementation construct the IRO as an ordered list
              always, sometimes or never?

           c. If your answer to part (b) is Sometimes, what criteria
              do you use to decide if the IRO is an ordered or
              unordered list?

           d. If your answer to part (b) is Always or Sometimes, does
              your implementation construct the IRO as a sequence of
              strict hops or as a sequence of loose hops?

       2. IRO Decoding

           a. Does your implementation decode IRO?

           b. If your answer to part (a) is Yes, does your
              implementation interpret the decoded IRO as an ordered
              list always, sometimes or never?

           c. If your answer to part (b) is Sometimes, what criteria do
              you use to decide if the IRO is an ordered or unordered
              list?

           d. If your answer to part (b) is Always or Sometimes, does
              your implementation interpret the IRO as a sequence of
              strict hops or as a sequence of loose hops?

       3. Impact

           a. Will there be an impact to your implementation if RFC 5440
              is updated to state that the IRO is an ordered list?

           b. Will there be an impact to your implementation if RFC 5440
              is updated to state that the IRO is an unordered list?

           c. If RFC 5440 is updated to state that the IRO is an
              ordered list, will there be an impact to your
              implementation if RFC 5440 is also updated to allow IRO
              sub-objects to use the loose bit (L-bit)?

       4. Respondents

           a. Are you a Vendor/Research Lab/Software House/Other (please
              specify)?

              implementation for a shipping product, product under
              development or a prototype?

                              Table 3: Impact

   It is interesting to note that most implementation that responded to
   the survey finds that there is no impact to their existing or under-
   development implementation if [RFC5440] is updated to state that the
   IRO as an ordered list.  Further most implementations find that
   support for loose bit (L-bit) for IRO has minimal or no impact on
   their implementation.

5.  Conclusions

   The results shown in this survey seems to suggest that most
   implementations would be fine with updating [RFC5440] to specify IRO
   as an ordered list with no impact on the shipping or under-
   development products.  It is also the conclusion of this survey to
   suggest that it would be helpful to update [RFC5440] to enable
   support for loose bit (L-bit) such that both strict and loose hops
   could be supported in the IRO.

5.1.  Proposed Action

   The proposed action is as follows:

   o  Update [RFC5440] to specify IRO as an ordered list.

   o  Update [RFC5440] to specify support for loose bit (L-bit) for IRO.

   o  Remove the new IRO option from draft-ietf-pce-pcep-domain-
      sequence-05.

   An update to IRO specification are proposed in
   [I-D.dhody-pce-iro-update].

6.  Security Considerations

   This survey defines no protocols or procedures and so includes no
   security-related protocol changes.  Clarification in the supported
   IRO ordering or loose bit handling will not have any negative
   security impact.  The survey responses in this document were
   collected by email and that email was not authenticated, although
   responses were sent to the respondents that might have triggered
   alarms if the responses were spoofed.  Spoofed or malicious responses
   could represent an attack on the IETF process and so this survey
   should be treated with some caution where there is reason to suspect
   such an attack.  Further, this survey was compiled and anonymized by
   the working group chairs.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This informational document makes no requests to IANA for action.
