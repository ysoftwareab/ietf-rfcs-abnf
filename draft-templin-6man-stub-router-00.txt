         Stub Router Advertisements in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
                 draft-templin-6man-stub-router-00.txt

Abstract

   The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol [RFC4861] specifies the
   operation of routers, including the process of sending and receiving
   Router Advertisement (RA) messages.  However, the specification makes
   no distinction between different classes of routers that may occur on
   a link.  In particular, the specification is written from the
   perspective of routers that are "authoritative for the link", i.e.,
   routers that connect the link to provider networks.  This document
   discusses considerations for a different class of routers known as
   "stub routers".

Internet-Draft          Stub Router Advertisement          November 2009


1.  Introduction

   The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol [RFC4861][RFC2460] specifies the
   operation of routers, including the process of sending and receiving
   Router Advertisement (RA) messages.  However, the specification makes
   no distinction between different classes of routers that may occur on
   a link.  In particular, the specification is written from the
   perspective of routers that are "authoritative" for the link, i.e.,
   routers that connect the link to provider networks.  This document
   discusses considerations for a different class of routers known as
   "stub routers".

   A stub router is any router that attaches stub networks to the link,
   but does not itself attach the link to a provider network.  Here, a
   "stub network" could be as simple as a small collection of IPv6
   links, or as large as a complex corporate enterprise network.  Stub
   routers are said to be "non-authoritative" for the link, since they
   cannot themselves provide forwarding services for packets emanating
   from their stub networks without using another router on the link as
   a transit.

   Stub routers may send Router Advertisements (RAs) only if the RAs
   include no information that could conflict with the information
   advertised by authoritative routers.  As such, stub router RAs must
   be sent as unicast-only since the 'M' and 'O' flags (and possibly
   other information) in the RAs could override the values that hosts
   have cached from RAs received from an authoritative router.
   Moreover, stub router RAs must be sent only to other routers, since
   legacy hosts have no way to determine whether the RA came from an
   authoritative or non-authoritative router.

   The following sections outline processing rules for stub router RAs.
   Also specified are two new RA flags known as the "Stub Router
   Advertisement (SRA)" and "Stub Router Solicitation (SRS)" flags that
   stub routers can use to exchange information with other routers.


2.  Terminology and Requirements

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Sending Stub Router Advertisements

   Stub routers sends RAs to the unicast addresses of other routers on
   the link discovered through a link-specific means.  Examples include

   listening for multicast RAs from authoritative routers, parsing a
   list of unicast addresses of on-link routers, etc.  Stub routers MUST
   set all authoritative fields in the RA message to 0, including:

   o  the Cur Hop Limt field,

   o  the 'M' and 'O' bits,

   o  any other flag bits that are authoritative for the link (e.g., the
      Router Selection Preference bits [RFC4191]),

   o  the Router Lifetime field,

   o  the Reachable Time field,

   o  The Retrans Timer field.

   Additionally, stub router RAs MUST NOT include options that contain
   information that is authoritative for the link.  Examples include the
   link MTU option and Prefix Information Options (PIOs).

   Stub router RAs set a new flag known as the Stub Router Advertisement
   (SRA) flag [RFC5175]; they also set the Stub Router Solicitation
   (SRS) flag in RAs for which they require receipt of confirmation (see
   Section 4).

   When the SRS flag is set, stub routers send up to
   MAX_RTR_SOLICITATIONS RAs until a unicast RA response is received.
   Stub routers parse any such unicast RAs in the same manner as a host
   would parse them, except that they ignore the values in the 'A' and
   'L' bits of any PIOs and treat those values as zero.  Hence, stub
   routers may discover IPv6 prefixes that are associated with the link
   but MUST NOT configure addresses from those prefixes nor assign those
   prefixes to an interface.


4.  Processing Stub Router Advertisements

   [RFC4861], Section 6.2.7 states that "Any other action on reception
   of Router Advertisement messages by a router" (i.e., other than
   consistency checking) "is beyond the scope of this document.".  This
   document therefore updates [RFC4861] by specifying the manner in
   which routers process Stub Router Advertisements.

   When a router (either authoritative or stub) receives an RA message
   with the SRA flag set, it ignores all fields and options in the RA
   that are authoritative for the link (see Section 3) and processes all
   other options, including Route Information Options (RIOs) [RFC4191].

   If the SRS flag is also set, the router prepares a unicast RA message
   with the SRS flag set to 0 and sends the message to the unicast
   source address of the RA that elicited the response.


5.  Stub Router Solicitation by Authoritative Routers

   Authoritative routers may solicit unicast RA responses from other
   routers by sending unicast RA messages with the SRS and SRA bits set
   as specified in Section 4 and 5.  If so, the authoritatitve router
   processes any information that is authoritatitve for the link for
   consistency checking purposes only.


6.  IANA Considerations

   New Router Advertisement flag bits [RFC5175] are requested for the
   SRA and SRS flags.


7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC4861] apply.


8.  Acknowledgments

   The author acknowledges the many list discussions which have covered
   topics such as RA 'M' and 'O' bit settings, PIO 'A' and 'L' bit
   settings, rogue router advertisements, RA guards, etc.
