Internet-Draft          Security Threats for NHDP          November 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) [NHDP] allows routers to
   exchange information about their one-hop and two-hop neighbors by
   means of HELLO messages.  It is a common base protocol for several
   protocols in the MANET working group, such as OLSRv2 [OLSRv2] and SMF
   [SMF].  The neighborhood information, exchanged between routers using
   NHDP, serves these routing protocols as a baseline for calculating
   paths to all destinations in the MANET, relay set selection for
   network-wide transmissions etc.

   Due to the fact that NHDP is typically used in wireless environments,
   it is potentially exposed to different kinds of security threats,
   some of which are of particular significance as compared to wired
   networks.  As wireless radio waves can be captured as well as
   transmitted by any wireless device within radio range, there is
   commonly no physical protection as for wired networks.  The NHDP
   specification does not define any security means for protecting the
   integrity of the information it acquires, however suggests that this
   be addressed in a fashion appropriate to the deployment of the
   network.

   This document will describe these security attacks which NHDP is
   vulnerable to.  In addition, the document outlines the consequences
   of such security attacks to NHDP for routing protocols using NHDP for
   neighborhood discovery.  It is out of scope of this document to
   provide solutions to counteract security attacks to NHDP.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this document uses the terminology of [RFC5444] and
   [NHDP].


3.  NHDP Threat Overview

   NHDP [NHDP] defines a message exchange protocol based on HELLO
   messages in order for each router to acquire topological information
   about 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors.  It specifies information bases that
   store the information and the necessary message exchange.  These
   information bases can be accesses by routing protocols such as OLSRv2
   [OLSRv2] to construct routes to destinations in the MANET.

Internet-Draft          Security Threats for NHDP          November 2009


   Every router periodically transmits HELLO messages on each of its
   interfaces with a hop-limit of 1 (i.e.  HELLOs are never forwarded by
   a router).  In these HELLO messages, a router announces the IP
   addresses of heard, symmetric and lost neighbor interface addresses.

   An adversary has several ways of harming the neighbor discovery
   process: It can announce "wrong" information about its identity,
   postulate non-existent links, and replay HELLO messages.  These
   attacks are presented in detail in Section 4.

   The different ways of attacking an NHDP deployment will eventually
   lead to inconsistent information bases, not reflecting the correct
   topology of the MANET any more.  This means that routers may be
   unable to detect links to their neighbors correctly (for NHDP), and
   thus corrupt the routing process of a routing protocol using the
   neighbor information of NHDP.  These implications to protocols using
   the state of NHDP are in detail described in Section 5.


4.  Detailed Description of Security Threats to NHDP

   In this section, the different kind of threats to NHDP are detailed.
   For every attack, a description of the mechanism of the attack is
   followed by the implications for the NHDP instance.  Implications on
   routing protocols using NHDP are presented in Section 5.

   For simplicity, in all examples contained in the following sections,
   it is assumed that routers only have a single interface with a single
   IP address configured.  All the attacks apply as well for routers
   with multiple interfaces and multiple addresses.

4.1.  Jamming

   One vulnerability, common for all protocols operating a wireless ad
   hoc network, is that of "jamming" - i.e. that a router generates
   massive amounts of interfering radio transmissions, which will
   prevent legitimate traffic (e.g. control traffic as well as data
   traffic) on part of a network.  This vulnerability cannot be dealt
   with at L3 (if at all), leaving the network without the ability to
   maintain connectivity.  Jamming is somewhat similar to that of
   network overload and subsequent denial of service: a sufficiently
   significant amount of control traffic is lost, preventing HELLO
   messages to be correctly received.

   If a considerable amount of HELLO messages are lost or corrupted due
   to collisions, neighbor routers are able not any more to establish
   links between them.  This effectively renders NHDP unusable for upper
   layer protocols, since no stable links can be used for sending out

   control packets, or for calculating routing information.

4.2.  Incorrect HELLO Message Generation

   Every router running NHDP performs mainly two tasks: Periodically
   generating HELLO messages and processing incoming HELLO messages from
   neighbor routers.  This section describes two security attacks
   involving the HELLO generation.

4.2.1.  Identity Spoofing

   The so-called identity spoofing implies that a router sends HELLO
   messages pretending to have the identity of another router.  An
   attacker can accomplish this by using another router's IP address in
   an address block of a HELLO, and associating this address with a
   LOCAL_IF Address Block TLV.  In addition, it may need to set the
   source address of the IP header that contains the control message.

   If a router receives such a forged HELLO message from a neighbor, it
   will assume that this HELLO comes from a router with the claimed
   interface address.  As a consequence, it will add a Link Tuple to
   that neighbor with the spoofed address, and include it in its next
   HELLO messages as a heard neighbor (and possibly as symmetric
   neighbor after another HELLO exchange).

   Identity spoofing is particular harmful if a router spoofs the
   identity of another router that exists in the same routing domain.
   With respect to NHDP, such a duplicated, spoofed address can lead to
   an inconsistent state up to two hops from a router.  Figure 1)
   depicts a simple example.  In that example, router A is in radio
   range of C, but not of X. If X spoofs the address of A, that can lead
   to conflicts for upper-layer routing protocols, and therefore for
   wrong path calculations as well as incorrect data traffic forwarding.

   | A |----| C |----| X |

                                 Figure 1

   Figure 2) depicts another example.  In this example, A is two hops
   away from router C, reachable through router B. If the attacker X
   spoofs the address of A, C may think that A is indeed reachable
   through router D.

4.2.2.  Link Spoofing

   Similarly, link spoofing implies that a router sends HELLO messages,
   signaling an incorrect set of neighbors.  This may take either of two
   forms: An attacker can postulate addresses of non-present neighbor
   routers in an address block of a HELLO, associated with LINK_STATUS
   TLVs.  Alternatively, a compromised router can "ignore" existing
   neighbors by not advertizing them in its HELLO messages.

   The effect of link spoofing with respect to NHDP are twofold,
   depending on the two cases mentioned above: If the compromised router
   ignores existing neighbors, there may not be any connectivity to or
   from these routers to others routers in the MANET.  If, on the other
   hand, the router advertizing non-existing links, this can lead wrong
   topological information in the information base, which may be used by
   routing protocols.

4.3.  Replay attack

   A replay attack is, simply, where control traffic from one region of
   the network is recorded and replayed in a different region (this type
   of attack is also known as the Wormhole attack).  This may, for
   example, happen when two routers collaborate on an attack, one
   recording traffic in its proximity and tunneling it to the other
   router, which replays the traffic.  In a protocol where links are
   discovered by testing reception, this will result in extraneous link
   creation (basically, a link between the two ``attacking'' routers).
   While this may result from an attack, we note that it may also be
   intentional: if data-traffic too is relayed over the virtual link
   over the ``tunnel'', the link being detected is, indeed valid.  This
   is, for instance, used in wireless repeaters.  If data traffic is not
   carried over the virtual link, an imaginary, compromised, link has
   been created.  Replay attacks can be especially damaging if coupled
   with spoofing and playing with sequence numbers in the replayed
   messages, potentially destroying some important topology information
   in routers all over the network.

    NHDP

   Section 4 which lead to an inconsistent state of the topology on the
   routers.  This section describes the impact for routing protocols
