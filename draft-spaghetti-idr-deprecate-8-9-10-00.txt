1.  Introduction

   It has been discovered that certain BGP OPEN Message Error subcodes
   have been used in BGP implementations which have been deployed in the
   wild while not being assigned by the IANA for such usage.
   Unregistered usage of BGP OPEN Message Error subcodes can lead to
   increased difficulty when troubleshooting why BGP sessions are torn
   down.

   The use of these unregistered values was noticed when the concept of
   Route Leak Prevention and Detection using Roles in UPDATE and OPEN
   Messages [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy] was initially assigned value
   8 by IANA.  It was subsequently discovered that a widely-deployed
   BGP-4 [RFC4271] implementation had released code which used BGP OPEN
   Message Error Subcode 8.  As a workaround, a new Early IANA
   Allocation is to be requested.

   The squatting of values 8, 9, and 10 has been confirmed by the
   involved vendors or through source code review.

2.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, IANA is requested to mark values 8, 9, and 10 as
   "deprecated" in the "OPEN Message Error subcodes" registry under the
   "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" group.  The marking
   "deprecated" meaning "use is not recommended" ([RFC8126]).

3.  Security Considerations

   There are no meaningful security consequences arising from this
   registry update.
