Internet-Draft          SRTP AES-192 and AES-256              March 2009


1.  Introduction

   This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
   [FIPS197] with 192 and 256 bit keys within the Secure RTP protocol
   [RFC3711].  Below those block ciphers are referred to as AES-192 and
   AES-256, respectively, and the use of AES with a 128 bit key is
   referred to as AES-128.  This document defines Counter Mode
   encryption for SRTP and SRTCP and a new SRTP Key Derivation Function
   for AES-192 and AES-256.  It also defines new cryptosuites that use
   these new functions.

   While AES-128 is widely regarded as more than adequately secure, some
   users may be motivated to adopt AES-192 or AES-256.  One motivation
   is conformance to the Suite B profile (which requires AES-256 for the
   protection of TOP SECRET information) [suiteB].  Others may be
   motivated by a perceived need to purse a highly conservative security
   strategy; see Section 7 for more discussion of security issues.

   The crypto functions defined in this document are an addition to, and
   not a replacement for, the crypto functions defined in [RFC3711].

1.1.  Conventions Used In This Document

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  AES-192 and AES-256 Encryption

   Section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711] defines AES-128 counter mode encryption,
   which it refers to as AES_CM.  AES-192 counter mode and AES-256
   counter mode are defined in a similar manner, and are denoted as
   AES_192_CM and AES_256_CM respectively.  In both of these ciphers,
   the plaintext inputs to the block cipher are formed as in AES_CM, and
   the block cipher outputs are processed as in AES_CM.  The only
   difference in the processing is that AES_192_CM uses AES-192, and
   AES_256_CM uses AES-256.  Both AES_192_CM and AES_256_CM use a 112-
   bit salt as an input, as does AES_CM.

   For the convenience of the reader, the structure of the counter
   blocks in SRTP counter mode encryption is illustrated in Figure 1,
   using the terminology from Section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711] .  In this
   diagram, the symbol (+) denotes the bitwise exclusive-or operation,
   and the AES encrypt operation uses AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256 for
   AES_CM, AES_192_CM, and AES_256_CM, respectively.  The field labeled
   b_c contains a block counter, the value of which increments once for
   each invocation of the "AES Encrypt" function.

3.  The AES_CM_192_PRF and AES_CM_256_PRF Key Derivation Functions

   Section 4.3.3 of [RFC3711] defines AES-128 counter mode key
   derivation function, which it refers to as "AES-CM PRF".  (That
   specification uses the term PRF, or pseudo-random function,
   interchangeably with the term "key derivation function". ) The AES-
   192 counter mode PRF and AES-256 counter mode PRF are defined in a
   similar manner, and are denoted as AES_192_CM_PRF and AES_256_CM_PRF
   respectively.  In both of these PRFs, the plaintext inputs to the
   block cipher are formed as in the AES-CM PRF, and the block cipher
   outputs are processed as in the AES-CM PRF.  The only difference in
   the processing is that AES_192_CM_PRF uses AES-192, and
   AES_256_CM_PRF uses AES-256.  Both AES_192_CM_PRF and AES_256_CM_PRF
   use a 112-bit salt as an input, as does the AES-CM PRF.

   For the convenience of the reader, the structure of the counter
   blocks in SRTP counter mode key derivation is illustrated in
   Figure 2, using the terminology from Section 4.3.3 of [RFC3711].  In
   this diagram, the symbol (+) denotes the bitwise exclusive-or
   operation, and the "AES Encrypt" operation uses AES-128, AES-192, or
   AES-256 for the "AES-CM PRF", AES_192_CM_PRF, and AES_256_CM_PRF,
   respectively.  The field "LB" contains the 8-bit constant "label"
   which is provided as an input to the key derivation function (and
   which is distint for each key generated by that function).  The field
   labeled b_c contains a block counter, the value of which increments
   once for each invocation of the "AES Encrypt" function.

3.1.  Usage Requirements

   When AES_192_CM is used for encryption, AES_192_CM SHOULD be used as
   the key derivation function, and AES_128_CM MUST NOT be used as the
   key derivation function.

   When AES_256_CM is used for encryption, AES_256_CM SHOULD be used as
   the key derivation function.  Both AES_128_CM and AES_192_CM MUST NOT
   be used as the key derivation function.

      Rationale: it is essential that the cryptographic strength of the
      key derivation meets or exceeds that of the encryption method.  It
      is natural to use the same function for both encryption and key
      derivation.  However, it is not required to do so because it is
      desirable to allow these ciphers to be used with alternative key
      derivation functions that may be defined in the future.

5.  Crypto Suties

   This section defines SRTP crypto suites that use the ciphers and key
   derivation functions defined in this document.  These suites are
   registered with IANA for use with the SDP Security Descriptions
   attributes (Section 10.3.2.1 of [RFC4568]).  Other SRTP key
   management methods that use the crypto functions defined in this
   document are encouraged to also use these crypto suite definitions.

   IANA is expected to assign the following parameters for the SDP
   Security Descriptions crypto suite attribute.

      AES_CM_192_HMAC_SHA1_80

      AES_CM_192_HMAC_SHA1_32

      AES_CM_256_HMAC_SHA1_80

      AES_CM_256_HMAC_SHA1_32

   The cryptosuites are as defined in Section 5.

7.  Security Considerations

   AES-128 provides a level of security that is widely regarded as being
   more than sufficient for providing confidentiality.  It is believed
   that the economic cost of breaking AES-128 is significantly higher
   than the cost of more direct approaches to violating system security,
   e.g. theft, bribery, wiretapping, and other forms of malfeasance.

   Future advances in the state of the art of cryptanalysis could
   eliminate this confidence in AES-128, and motivate the use of AES-192
   or AES-256.  AES-192 is regarded as being secure even against some
   adversaries for which breaking AES-128 may be feasible.  Similarly,
   AES-256 is regarded as being secure even against some adversaries for
   which it may be feasible to break AES-192.  The availability of the
   larger key size versions of AES provides a fallback plan in case of
   unanticipated cryptanalytic results.

   It is conjectured that AES-256 provides adequate security even
   against adversaries that possess the ability to construct a quantum
   computer that works on 256 or more quantum bits.  No such computer is
   known to exist; its feasibility is an area of active speculation and
   research.

   Despite the apparent sufficiency of AES-128, some users are
   interested in the larger AES key sizes.  For some applications, the
   40% increase in computational cost for AES-256 over AES-128 is a
   worthwhile bargain when traded for the security advantages outlined
   above.  These applications include those with a perceived need for
   very high security, e.g. due to a desire for very long-term
   confidentiality.

   As with any cipher, the conjectured security level of AES may change
   over time.  The considerations in this section reflect the best
   knowledge available at the time of publication of this document.

   It is desirable that AES_192_CM and AES_192_CM_PRF be used with an
   authentication function that uses a 192 bit key, and that AES_256_CM
   and AES_256_CM_PRF be used with an authentication function that uses
   a 256 bit key.  However, this desire is not regarded as security-
   critical.  Cryptographic authentication is resilient against future
   advances in cryptanalysis, since the opportunity for a forgery attack
   against a session closes when that session closes.

8.  Open Questions

   It may be desirable to eliminate AES-192 altogether, leaving users
   with the simpler choice of using AES-128 or AES-256.  This option
   preserves the possibility of Suite B conformance.  Given that the
   incremental computational cost of AES-256 over AES-192 is only 16%,
   and the additional key storage overhead is only 33%, this option
   imposes only a minimal burden on implementations.
